<h2>History</h2>
<p>For a time, he lived in Memnon , learning the art of longsword fighting from Shieldlord Hastor el Khafar .</p>
<p>Something of a wanderer, Vyaalis's curiosity led him to explore the surface world in Calimshan and Tethyr . His interest in the longsword stemmed from his discovery of one among the wreckage of the Pasha's Palace , a sunken Calishite vessel.</p>
