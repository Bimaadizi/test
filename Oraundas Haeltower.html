<p>Oraundas Haeltower was a vintner from the land of Tethyr in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Oraundas was best known for producing drinkable but rather unexceptional table wines sold throughout the Sword Coast . His wines kept well and were a favorite among innkeepers and shopkeepers. His vast vineyards lay northeast of Vineshade in the Purple Hills region of Tethyr. Although Haeltower's wines were transported in wooden casks , many buyers bottled the wine in glass bottles for resale.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1479 DR , many strange items were found in bottles of Haeltower wines. These items included gold rings , gems , and ornate keys . The Tethyrian queen ordered an investigation led by Storl Thammuraster who, with the help of a Sembian wizard named Amaront of Selgaunt , uncovered an Amnian smuggling operation run by several prominent noble families.</p>
