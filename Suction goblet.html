<p>Suction goblets were a variety of drinking cups invented in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In appearance, suction goblets looked the same as their ordinary variety. Their base hid a cleverly designed suction cup that prevented the goblet from tipping even in the roughest seas. However, unlike more expensive functioning suction goblets, there existed many cheap ripoff versions made of wood .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Suction goblets were still a very recent invention circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , but they quickly proved to be very popular among honest sailors and pirates of the Sea of Swords . As of the late 14 th center DR, cheap wooden suction goblets could be found on the Nelanther Isles off the Sword Coast and even sold by Sister Tasina of the Temple of Umberlee in Spindrift Town .</p>
