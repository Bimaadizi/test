<p>Timothy was a grain-producing grass found in Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Timothy was cultivated for its grain in ancient Netheril alongside wheat , spelt , rye , oats , and bran . It could also be found in as harsh environments as the Ibelgrak Valley in the Great Glacier .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Timothy plants were affected by the wheat rust blight, which destroyed the plants and their grains during the time of Netheril. The spreading disease was cured in 3165 NY (−694 DR) by the arcanist Candlemas , who used a complex combination of magics to produce a cure and save the crops.</p>
