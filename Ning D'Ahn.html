<p>Ning D'Ahn was a monk of the Way of Enlightenment , the Abbot of U'Chan Gompa , and the seventh High Lord of Oceans of Tabot around Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ning D'Ahn was chosen to be the seventh High Lama by his predecessor at the tender age of eight, circa Shou Year 2251 (1001 DR) . As was now custom, the former High Lama left the boy to his new life and wandered away into the mountains.</p>
<p>Ning's rule was a difficult one, suffering from the revolt of Baron Phen Do and the protests of the southern monasteries , who complained strenuously about the High Lord's tithings and adopted radical stances, thus paralyzing the yig-tsang (monk council) and presaging a separatist movement. The High Lord filled the Lon Chen (chief ministers) with trusted northern monks, which only alienated the southerners further.</p>
<p>By 2607, he had twice been the target of assassination, both times by a ninja disguised as a lama. These left Ning D'Ahn highly paranoid. Thus, Ning was protected by his fanatical personal guards, the No-Haree .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>At the age of 64, Ning was tall and slender and shaved his head. He wore robes stitched with gold and silver and adorned with jewels . He was never seen without the magical Staff of Oceans , the symbol of power of the High Lord and carried whenever seen in public.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Twice a year, he appeared to the common people while presiding at two outdoor festivals: the Wona Chu'ing in the middle of winter, and the Dui'yu, a harvest celebration.</p>
