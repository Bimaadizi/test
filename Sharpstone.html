<p>Sharpstone , also known as novaculite , was a quartz variety that occurred in various colors.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This stone was usually gritty and its major use was for sharpening. Occasionally the grit was fine enough to make large cabochon ornamental stones . Sharpstone's hardness made it difficult to polish to full luster. A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This stone could be used to increase the area of effect of a spell with a corresponding decrease in damage (or duration if the spell did not have a damage effect). Any size or amount of sharpstone could be used and was consumed in the casting.</p>
