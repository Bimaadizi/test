<p>Thashasa was a water spirit who resided in the enchanted Moon Pool in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Thashasa was a strange being that appeared as a humanoid female made out of water.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Thashasa was connected to the magical Moon Pool and was one with its waters. She could use the pool as a scrying device.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before 1370 DR , Ibbalar Thrul , a disgraced trader, Red Wizard , and an apprentice of Halaster Blackcloak , used his magic to transport the entire Moon Pool and its scenic waterfall into a chamber inside his Undermountain lair. He placed it so it was observable from his bedroom's balcony and was a shining gem of his extensive collection of magical trophies. Thashasa was transported into the mega-dungeons along with the pool and was trapped inside the wizard's domain. She held no good will towards her abductor and still possessed her free will, but could not stop Ibbalar from using the Moon Pool 's magic. She hated him, and in 1370 DR happily aided an adventurer sent by Khelben Arunsun to defeat the wizard. Following the confrontation, Ibbalar escaped and, apart from losing a few magical items from his collection, remained at large and in possession of the Moon Pool .</p>
