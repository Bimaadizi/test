<p>Zedarr T'sarran was a male drow from Maerimydra , the son of Irae T'sarran and an unholy champion of Kiaransalee .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Although Zedarr was of average height for a male drow , he was an imposing figure in his black full plate armor . He kept his visor down most of the time (especially in combat) due to terrible scars across his face. Zedarr's dark skin was mottled with pink burns marks.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>After Zedarr was captured and hideously scarred by rangers of the Dalelands he became consumed by the retributive tenets of his goddess, Kiaransalee . The blackguard fully embraced the virtue of " answer any slight a thousandfold " to the extent he held an eternal grudge against all the people of the Dales. He took a fierce delight in battle and had an appreciation of fine furnishings.</p>
<h2>Relationship</h2>
<p>Zedarr had developed a strong bond with the fiendish displacer beast , Ripper .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>A skilled warrior and commanding leader, in combat Zedarr whirled both ends of his double-ended dire flail faster than the eye could see, often crippling his foes weapons with his blows. He had also cultivated a dirty fighting style that took advantage of the weak points of his enemies.</p>
<p>Zedarr's favor with his goddess granted him powers beyond the ken or ordinary soldiers, suffusing him with a despairing aura. These powers also enabled him to command undead and even smite goodly folk.</p>
