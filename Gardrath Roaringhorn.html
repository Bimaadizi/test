<h2>History</h2>
<p>Shortly after the victory over Thauglor, Gardrath and three companions (Aubleth Crownsilver, Lareth Huntsilver , and Aiken Wyvernspur ) came upon the so-called Harp of Healing floating in a glade near the road to Suzail. It was glowing softly in the night and played gentle music as sick and injured people from the surrounding area came to touch it and then disappear into the forest, apparently joyous at being healed or cured. The four felt that such a wondrous curiosity should be controlled by the crown and they took it to the court in Suzail and presented it to the War Wizard on duty at the time. The harp went dark and quiet when they touched it, and it remained in that state whenever any of the four men were within about 15 ft (4.6 m) or six strides from the instrument.</p>
<p>The winter in the Year of the Sure Quarrel, 1019 DR was unusually harsh and Gardrath contracted a fever that he felt was going to send him to his grave. Before the sickness sapped all his strength, he dressed in his finest pair of boots, took his best sword, and went hunting for wolves in the forest by himself. The next day he was found dead among the bodies of six wolves. His story was told and retold for generations in the barracks of the Purple Dragons .</p>
