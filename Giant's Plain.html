<p>The name of these plains has changed at least twice. The first after the impressive rout of the resident giants by the dwarves of High Shanatar which slaughtered over 5000 of the creatures in −5350 DR . The general of that successful army was named Karlyn and the area was dubbed Karlyn's Vale in his honor. In −2600 DR the last known surviving descendants of that army were killed by humans and the name was lost, though a monument to Karlyn still stands in the Troll Mountains known as the Wailing Dwarf .</p>
<h2>Flora & Fauna</h2>
<p>The Giant's Plain was home to large herds of migratory animals that traveled from the Western Heartlands . These beasts included rothé , deer , and boars , that, in turn, served as a food source for the Sword Coast dragons , who considered it to be their "happy hunting ground."</p>
