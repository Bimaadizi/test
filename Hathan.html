<p>On 240Â DR , right as Athalgard was besieged by the forces under the leadership of Elminster Aumar , prince of that land, Hathan was outside Hornkeep as he received a message from The Old One, presumably Ithboltar . He immediately spell-mindsent to his master, Undarl Dragonrider, who responded with irritation, biding him take to his own affairs.
