<p>Gricks were large worm-like creatures that lived away from sunlight. Their head was composed of a sharp beak surrounded by four tentacles.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The main body of an adult grick was about 6 ft (1.8 m) long. Including the length of the tentacles, this made a grick about 8 ft (2.4 m) long. A grick's head featured a pair of tiny eyes and a snapping beak surrounded by large barbed tentacles. The tentacles would cover the beak unless the grick was attacking or eating.</p>
<p>Grick skin was rubbery and uniformly dark with with pale underbellies. Colouration varied from dark greens to blues .Their skin would camouflage well in rocky terrain and shadows.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Gricks were almost always hungry and would seek to hunt anything that moves (except other gricks) . Gricks would also immediately attack whenever their nest was threatened.</p>
<p>Gricks were adept at climbing and could slither up walls with little difficulty. Although they prefer to stay underground or indoors, gricks would venture into the open if food was scarce. Even then, gricks would only do so at night to avoid burning their small and sensitive eyes.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Gricks preferred to hunt in packs but could also be found hunting alone. Gricks hunted by waiting in busy areas and ambushing their prey. Gricks used their natural camoflage to remain hidden in rocky terrain.</p>
<p>If hunting in a pack, gricks would maneuver to outflank their prey wherever possible. . Due to their relatively small beaks, gricks could only take small bites of food. As a result gricks preferred to drag prey back to their nest once it was unconscious or dead.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Gricks laid oblong blue/green eggs about the size of a human fist. Young gricks were known as grick wormlings. Grick wormlings were edible and were known to be served in the Dalelands stuffed with rice pilaf and diced celery. Cured and spiced grick tentacles were also eaten.</p>
<p>Gricks could be made to serve abberrant creatures like grells .</p>
<p>Due to the grick's constant need to eat, some explorers consider the best way to kill a grick is to seal it inside its nest and wait for it to starve to death.</p>
