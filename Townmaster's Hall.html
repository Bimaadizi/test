<p>The Townmaster's Hall , later called the Town Council Hall , was the local government building in Phandalin .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The town hall was located just south of the center of the village.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The hall was a single story building made of good quality stone and was well built. The roof was made of wood with a bell tower rising from the back. A noticeboard near the front door displayed bulletins and information for residents and newcomers to town, some offering rewards for certain tasks.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The hall contained office space for the leader(s) of Phandalin as well as a small jail with two cells.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Phandalin was first resettled in the late 15 th century DR , the Townmaster's Hall was the office of Townmaster Harbin Wester , although he was known to also conduct official business from his personal home nearby.</p>
<p>After only a few years, confidence in the Townmaster had plummeted, and the position was dissolved and replaced with a Town Council consisting of Harbin Wester, Sildar Hallwinter , and Halia Thornton . While their meeting place continued to be known as the Townmaster's Hall for some time, it was eventually renamed to the "Town Council Hall." By the Year of the Duplicitous Courtier, 1496 DR , the town was undergoing a new political reorganization, and plans had been made to expand the hall to include a mayor's office.</p>
