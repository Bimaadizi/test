<p>The Redbrands , sometimes called the Redbrand Ruffians , were a group of bandits and brigands active in the resettled frontier town of Phandalin and nearby Triboar Trail region in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Redbrands mostly consisted of humans , male and female, although a handful of bugbears were also in the bandit group. Each Redbrand wore a simple, dirty scarlet cloak. These cloaks were recognized by the undead in their hideout, Tresendar Manor , and stopped them from attacking the bandits.</p>
<p>They were led by a mysterious wizard who they called Glasstaff .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Redbrands terrorized Phandalin's locals with threats and demands for protection money, which escalated into murder and kidnapping. In addition, they would capture travelers to be sold as slaves . Slaves and illicit goods were smuggled into and out of Phandalin via a secret tunnel which connected to the basement of their base beneath Tresendar Manor.</p>
<p>Apart from terrorizing the local populace, the Redbrands enjoyed drinking at the Sleeping Giant tavern.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Redbrands were founded by a traitorous agent of the Lords' Alliance named Iarno Albrek , calling himself "Glasstaff", in the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR . After making contact with " the Black Spider ", Iarno conspired to keep the population of Phandalin away from Wave Echo Cave , and in return he would receive a share of the spoils from Nezznar's excavation of the site.</p>
<p>With no local lord or powerful authority within the small town, the Redbrands were able to harass the farmers and prospectors for two months. Many were afraid of standing up to the bandit group, including the closest thing Phandalin had to a local authority, Townmaster Harbin Wester . Even so, some members of the community proved too hard or too dangerous to harass, such as Sister Garaele of the Shrine of Luck and Halia Thornton of the Phandalin Miner's Exchange . At some point, the Black Spider sent a group of bugbears to join the group and assist in keeping the people of Phandalin in line.</p>
<p>Things eventually escalated to a breaking point when the Redbrands killed the woodcarver, Thel Dendrar , and kidnapped his wife, Mirna , and their children, Nars and Nilsa . Soon after, the group was defeated and cleared from their hideout by a group of adventurers .</p>
