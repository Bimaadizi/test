<p>Snowdown was an island of the Moonshae Isles traditionally inhabited by the Ffolk . It was relatively isolated from the other Moonshaes, and was thus sometimes dubbed the Forgotten Isle .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Snowdown was the most temperate island of the Moonshaes, with few of the harsh winter storms that affected the other isles and a relatively mild climate that was good for agriculture. It was characterized by rolling hills and good roads.</p>
<p>The island had several dozen small settlements, mostly focused on farming. These were clusters of cottages where the farmers and laborers lived, centered around a fortified lord's manor.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Snowdown was one of the smaller of the Moonshae Isles. It lay to the east of the island of Gwynneth and to the south of Alaron .</p>
<p>The Andover Heights dominated the island's western side. There were three lakes, Mal Feargal in the north, and Mal Sul and Harloch (which were connected by a short river) in the central region. The Maloren Sods occupied much of the easternmost parts of Snowdown. The settlements of Pengram , Harloch , and Llandrain , as well as the city of Westphal , were all connected by the Snowdown Ride ; the only other settlement was Brannoch . A single Moonwell was located in the forest near the southern shore of Mal Sul.</p>
<p>The island had no deep-water harbors, which forced the inhabitants to be relatively self-sufficient owing to a relative lack of trade.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The seat of power on the island was Caer Westphal .</p>
<p>As of the 14 th century DR , the Ffolk of Snowdown were united in a peaceful kingdom of the same name . However, this kingdom was toppled at the start of the 15 th century DR by Amn , who installed Lady Erliza Daressin as their viceroy to rule the island. Lady Daressin, who was secretly a vampire , would continue to rule the island for decades, and as of the late 15 th century DR, pretended to be her own great-granddaughter to disguise her immortality. The Amnian merchant houses aspired to use Snowdown as a launchpad for further colonization and domination of the Moonshae Isles.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Snowdown had a strong agricultural background, growing alfalfa , apples , barley , grapes , potatoes , wheat , and many other types of fruits and vegetables, including kiwis for export. Ale , mead , whiskey , and wine were all made on the island with local fruits and grains. Ranchers raised cattle , chickens , hogs , horses , and sheep .</p>
<p>Prior to its occupation, the island was the first stop for ships coming from Amn or Calimshan , and the royal family had provided supplies to other islands in the Moonshaes. Following their occupation, Amnian merchant cartels would ship anything of value back to Amn. This notably included all of the timber and mineral wealth they could rip from the land. Their ships clogged the island's small harbor, and taverns and brothels catering to the Amnians became big business.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Snowdown was one of the earlier islands settled by the Ffolk after their initial arrival on Gwynneth in the 2 nd century DR, and they were soon joined by halflings . Because of its location as the furthest of the Ffolk lands from the realms of the Northlanders , Snowdown was raided much more rarely than other islands.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Saddle, 1345 DR , King Pwylloch of Snowdown was assassinated by Razfallow on the orders of Cyndre , thus ending the royal line.</p>
<p>During the late 14 th century DR, Amn slowly but steadily consolidated its influence on Snowdown. In the Year of the Sceptered One, 1404 DR , Amn hired mercenaries to invade the Moonshae Isles, whereupon they seized the island and it subjected it to Amnian rule. In the years that followed, Snowdown was effectively under a military occupation, with the royal family held hostage in their palace. Mercenary companies policed the cities, crushing any act of defiance or anyone who dared to show allegiance to the High King of the Moonshaes.</p>
<p>Over the following decades, the Amnian occupiers consumed and monetized the island's resources at a ferocious rate. They overworked the native Ffolk as they chopped down much of Snowdown's woodlands, stripped its mines, and clogged its waterways with refuse. Several rebellions arose to fight against Lady Erliza, each time ruthlessly put down by soldiers. By 1489 DR , the Amnians, noticing the island's diminishing returns, began to ponder that holding onto Snowdown might be more trouble than it was worth. Meanwhile, further Ffolk rebellions were quietly brewing with support from Alaron .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Ffolk and colonists from Amn lived on the island. It was one of the few places on the Moonshae Isles where the Ffolk had never mixed with Northlanders.</p>
<p>Following the Amnian occupation, the promise of wealth drew many Amnian immigrants seeking to exploit the island, although a handful of them became so taken with the natural beauty of the Moonshaes that they abandoned their avaricious goals. The island also experienced an influx of creatures seeking mercenary work, for the Amnian rulers didn't care about allegiances or origins of their mercenaries. These included drow , goblinoids , ogres , and orcs . The island especially experienced an influx of half-breed creatures, such as cambions , half-elves , and half-orcs . This influx of creatures made Snowdown feel more crowded than other islands in the Moonshaes as the number of inhabitants from foreign lands eventually outnumbered the population of native Ffolk.</p>
