<p>Dragon Barrow was the name given to the tomb of Lady Tanamere Alagondar of the Alagondar royal family of Neverwinter .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>From above, the whole barrow had the unique appearance of a dragon in flight. It was made up of a series of flat-topped, 30‑foot (9.1‑meter) high mounds forming the wings, tail, and body, with a row of 10‑foot (3‑meter) tall, sharp white boulders that comprised spines along the dragon's back. The entrance was concealed beneath one of these boulders.</p>
<p>The interior of the barrow consisted of dark, cramped passages and burial chambers made of packed dirt. It reeked of damp and death. There were several traps, including a false tomb containing stone sarcophagi rigged to release acrid dust on would-be tomb robbers.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The barrow was located about 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of Neverwinter . It lay amidst grassy hills not far from Neverwinter Wood , about 5 miles (8 kilometers) east of the High Road .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lady Tanamere died sometime in the late 14 th century DR while fighting alongside two parties of adventurers against the green dragon Azdraka . In accordance with her dying wishes, her barrow was erected near the location of the fateful battle and served as a tomb for herself and her fallen comrades.</p>
<p>When the white dragon Cryovain attacked the region a century later, Townmaster Harbin Wester of Phandalin recalled the tales of Lady Tanamere's deeds, and sought to send someone to raid the barrow and try to retrieve her dragon slayer sword .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In addition to Lady Tanamere, her squire and her horse were also interred in the barrow, along with four adventurers who perished alongside her in the battle with Azdraka. Finally, the bones of the dragon itself also lay near Lady Tanamere's sarcophagus.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, the tomb had become haunted by will-o'-wisps .</p>
