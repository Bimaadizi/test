<p>The medusa shield was a strange and likely unique enchanted buckler decorated with a snarling medusa 's face on its outward side.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The shield appeared unremarkable at first sight in design and crafting. However, if wilded in battle, the visage of a snarling medusa appeared to be more than just decoration. The shield possessed a +1 enchantment and made its wielder immune to all poisons . It also held ten charges of the flesh to stone spell that could be activated at will, making the medusa image on the shield petrify the wielder's opponent.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>All information about the medusa shield was obscured by mystery. In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the medusa shield made its way to the city of Westgate where it was sold among countless unique and rare weapons and armor on the city's busy Market Triangle .</p>
