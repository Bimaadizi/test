<p>A pouch of accessibility was a magic item capable of carrying a great amount of weight.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These mundane looking pouches could carry up to 300 lb (140 kg) of weight within 30 interior compartments. No more than 10 lb (4.5 kg) of weight, or 1 ft³ (28 L) of volume, could be stored in one of the compartments. To retrieve an item inside of the pouch the name of the item simply needed to be spoken aloud, causing the item to appear at the top of the pouch where it could be grabbed.</p>
<p>A pouch of accessibility weighed 1 lb (450 g) when empty and only 4 lb (1,800 g) if filled to capacity.</p>
