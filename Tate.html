<p>Tate was an orphaned child adopted by the High Harper of Baldur's Gate , Jaheira in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, Tate was a mild-mannered and quiet human child with a light skin tone, brown hair, and eyes. He was lovingly nicknamed "Sneak Thief" by his adoptive mother for the kid's tendency to sneak around, borrow things, and listen in on adults' conversations. Older step-sibling Jhessem tended to "boss" Tate around, and the boy looked forward to Jaheira's return home so he could get a breather from his brothers and sisters.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tate's parents disappeared in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . They were among the first people taken by the Cult of the Absolute . Harpers tried to investigate the disappearance but returned empty-handed, presuming that they were not infected with illithid tadpoles, deemed "unworthy," and killed or sent to serve the cult in some other manner. All lone, Tate was sent to the High Harper of Baldur's Gate, who had a long history of raising orphans in her Lower City home.</p>
<p>During his stay with Jaheira, Tate liked hiding away in the High Harper's library and office, where he cracked her secret door that was opened by inserting a harper pin into a hidden slot. Tate often came to "keeping the pin safe" and playing in Jaheira's underground sanctuary that was off-limits to everyone but the High Harper herself and her animal messengers.</p>
