<p>The chaotic neutral alignment was freedom from both society's restrictions and the zeal of morality.</p>
<p>These characters followed their whims on an individualistic accord. They avoided authority, shook off societal restraints and challenged the status quo throughout their lives. These people often believed there was no order to anything, and used that as a guiding principle for their actions.</p>
<p>Chaotic neutral characters could be somewhat unpredictable, but their behavior was not totally random, or guided by undoing the work of others. While they valued their own liberty, they did not strive to protect, or inhibit, the freedom of others. On the other hand, they wouldn't intentionally disrupt organizations as part of a campaign of anarchy. To do either of these, they would had to have been motivated either by good, and desired to liberate the downtrodden, or by evil, and taken joy in making others suffer.</p>
<p>A wandering rogue who lived both by work for hire and petty theft was an example of a chaotic neutral character.</p>
<p>A chaotic neutral character disliked laws and regarded them as restrictions on their freedom. Lawful neutral characters were obsessed with guidelines and restrictions, and followed these codes to the letter. These two alignments were opposites.</p>
