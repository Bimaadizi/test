<p>Zuke was one of the many isolated villages of the Fochu Peninsula in Wa . Its people made their living primarily as weavers.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Most of the structures within the village were simple peasant shacks known as minka , built from wood with latticed walls and straw-thatched roofs. Apart from these poor residences were small barns, warehouses, and shops.</p>
<p>As a whole, the people of Zuke were much more welcoming of strangers than other settlements of the peninsula, but their shoya had no interested in interacting with visitors.</p>
<p>The hamlet had a population of about 350 individuals after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR) .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Zuke was located inland on the eastern side of the Fochu Peninsula of Tsukishima , near the northern tip of the Momoben Forest .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Villages in Wa were run by an administrator known as a shoya , typically a minor samurai , and Zuke was no different in this respect. The shoya could call upon a local militia if needed.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Like the other tiny settlements of the region, Zuke had little contact with the other villages, much less with the rest of Kara-Tur or regions beyond. The settlement's major industry was weaving.</p>
<p>The cost to spend the night in one of the small minkas was 4 fen . The village did not produce anything more expensive than 4 yuan to sell.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>About 35 citizens of Zuke served in its militia. These persons were only armed with simple clubs or spears .</p>
<h2>Religion</h2>
<p>Like most of the villages of the Peninsula, the people of Zuke were followers of the Path of Enlightenment . Unlike the other settlements, however, they did not demand a test of faith from strangers and were more welcoming of those of other faiths.</p>
<h2>Notable Inhabitants</h2>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed coiled dragon Za-Jikku began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical butterflies , the breath of which would create yun ch'i , the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever.</p>
