<p>Ushirilin was one of the many isolated villages of the Fochu Peninsula in Wa .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As a whole, the people of Ushirilin were much more welcoming of strangers than other settlements of the peninsula.</p>
<p>Ushirilin had a population of about 150 individuals after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR) , but before that time, the population had been over 250. Ushirilin had suffered greatly from attacks from yellow-robed raiders sent by Za-Jikku . Because of the raids, most of the structures of the village were in ruins.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Ushirilin was located at the northern end of the Fochu Peninsula, where it connected to the mainland of Tsukishima . It sat in the foothills of the Jufosu Mountains on a tributary of the Nanaichi River .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Villages in Wa were run by an administrator known as a shoya , typically a minor samurai . The shoya could call upon a local militia if needed.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Like the other tiny settlements of the region, Ushirilin had little contact with the other villages, much less with the rest of Kara-Tur or regions beyond. This was true even more so after the raids, as the people's efforts were dedicated almost solely to rebuilding their ruined village.</p>
<p>It was free to spend the night in one of the small minkas , and the people had a communal kitchen from which they distributed free fish and rice to hungry villagers or guests. The village did not produce anything more expensive than 1 yuan to sell.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>About 15 citizens of Ushirilin served in its militia. These persons were only armed with simple clubs or spears .</p>
<h2>Religion</h2>
<p>Unlike the other settlements in the region, the people of Awajiga were not particularly religious.</p>
<h2>Notable Inhabitants</h2>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed coiled dragon Za-Jikku began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical butterflies, the breath of which would create yun ch'i , the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever. The village of Ushirilin suffered especially severely from Za-Jikku's raids.</p>
