<h2>History</h2>
<p>He ambushed Alvaerele Tasundrym in the High Dale while she was picking mistflowers . Pretending to be sick, he lured her close enough that he could spit acid at her face; her response was quick enough nonetheless, and she used a number of spells to turn the acid into water, make it an endless stream, and then turn him to stone, converting him into the statue of Wizardgout Water .</p>
<p>Later, his petrified body was buried under a landslide, hiding the source of the stream.</p>
