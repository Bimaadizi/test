<p>Qaoz was the name of the elder brain who was written about in the short story, The Enticing Elder . It was unknown if Qaoz was a real living being, or fictional character created for the purpose of the story.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Qaoz was said to have led a community of mind flayers somewhere in the Underdark .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to The Enticing Elder , Qaoz was once approached by two sisters, one a fearsome warrior and the other a stalwart cleric . After killing many of Qaoz' illithid servitors, the sisters sought to slay Qaoz, each for their own reasons. The warrior wanted to end Qaoz' 'tyranny' and slay the elder brain, while the cleric sought to harness its powers for herself.</p>
<p>Qaoz took but a moment to consider the sisters and their declarations. It then used its profound psionic abilities to slay each of them in short order. The surviving mind flayer's of Qaoz' colony then feasted on the sisters' remains.</p>
