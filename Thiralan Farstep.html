<p>Thiralan Farstep was one of the Cormanthor Elves during their efforts to reclaim Myth Drannor during the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Thiralen had light skin, messy white hair, and pale white eyes. He wore an ornate suit of plate mail decorated with leafy designs.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1374 DR , Thiralen served as the Sergeant of the Guard at the Myth Drannor outskirts camp , helping protect the residents and travelers there. One of his concerns was the ability for elves to safely reach the camp, particularly the paths near the Spiderhaunt Wood where a large amount of spiderkind dwelt. While the patrols were successful at first, the traveling elves then started disappearing entirely. Perplexed by the development, Thiralen guided a group of trustworthy individuals to the site of the disappearances, where they discovered that the local ettercaps were kidnapping people to feed to the hungry and lazy fang dragon Nylerian .</p>
