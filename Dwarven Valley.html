<p>The Dwarven Valley was a deep rift in Icewind Dale , located along the southern slopes of the mountain called Kelvin's Cairn . Within the valley was a complex network of tunnels, subterranean passages and mines that composed the home of the dale's dwarves, particularly those from Clan Battlehammer .</p>
<h2>Geographical Features</h2>
<p>The valley held two dwarven halls, dug into the western and eastern walls. Each holding comprised their respective living quarters, dining areas, storerooms, armories, and at the heart of either hall, their forge.</p>
<p>Beyond the dwarfholds was a vast tunnel system that continued out into a number of mines. Some of these were abandoned, as the valuable ore found within had been entirely dug up. Among the minerals found within the mines was a substance they called black ice . This was in-fact a remnant of the malevolent monolith of Cryshal-Tirith .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid—14 th century DR , the dwarves of the valley managed to draw the wizard Akar Kessell and his forces within their southern tunnels. They proceeded to collapse the tunnels on them all, killing many and stopping their invasion of Icewind Dale.</p>
<p>In the years that followed, many of the dwarves from Clan Battlehammer left the valley and re-settled in the home of their lineage, Mithral Hall .</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Iron Dwarf's Vengeance, 1485 DR , the community of dwarves was divided into two factions. Those that followed the community's long-standing leader, Stokely Silverstream , and those under the influence of Baerick Hammerstone .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In addition to the dwarves of the hall, dark forces dwelled within the valley's southern tunnels. The undead Akar Kessel' remained within, having raised a small horde of dwarven zombies .</p>
