<p>Deogol Fengrath was a wizard of the Fengrath family and the ruling Gauntlet of the village of Shining Falls in the Delimbiyr Vale in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Home</h2>
<p>He lived in the Granite Tower in the center of Shining Falls with his family and guards, who tended also to be family, as well as his constructs , including at least one shield guardian .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Deogol was nominally the ruler of Shining Falls, but he did so with a light hand. So light, in fact, that he preferred to leave the day-to-day running of things to Sheriff Vendal Viccstray . Instead, he concentrated on his crafts and magic within the walls of the Granite Tower.</p>
<p>One particular project was discovering the dwarven complex thought to lie behind the Shining Falls , after which the village was named. He tried to hire adventurers for the task and enlisted Blaz Merrymar to aid him. Most in the village thought this foolish and a wasted effort.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>Deogol was the great grandson of Walenburh Fengrath , the founder of Shining Falls.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>He was reputed to be quite a powerful wizard, owing to his possession of at least one shield guardian.</p>
<p>One fellow in the village claimed to have seen skulking inside the keep an unusual dwarf -like creature with pale skin, bulbous eyes that lacked both pupils and irises, and ugly face muttered insanely. However, Deogol's guards were unsurprised and the witness believed Deogol had summoned it through magic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time after Shieldmeet in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Deogol went missing for at least a month, his fate and whereabouts unknown. Around the same time, a grim band of adventurers passed through Shining Falls on their way to the Fallen Lands . Any connection between them is unknown.</p>
