<p>House Phylund ( pronounced : /ˈ f aɪ l ʌ n d / FEYE-lund ) was a noble family of Waterdeep in the 14 th century DR and still had a significant presence circa 1492 DR . The primary family business was acquiring, taming, training, and selling fierce beasts.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the head of the family was Urtos Phylund II and his consort Lythis . They had a son, Tarnos , and two others, but the official heir recognized by the Lords of Waterdeep was Urtos III , son of Urtos I and his consort (and widow), Aridarye . At this time, there were fourteen Phylund nobles in all.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Specializing in the many uses of monsters, they captured, bred, and sold monsters as pets, guard beasts, and arena fighters. Those that couldn't be tamed or used in the arena were either released to be hunted for sport or harvested for their flesh, skin, and bones. The Phylunds sponsored both monster hunting expeditions and adventuring parties to procure new beasts. In the mid-14 th century, they had a thriving monster safari business that attracted adventurous nobles to pay for the experience of hunting exotic monsters in Ardeep Forest . With his marriage to Lady Lythis Mhairuun, Urtos II acquired the secrets and techniques for breeding and training watchspiders for the Phylund clan, which significantly increased the family's already considerable fortunes.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Phylund family estate was located in the North Ward on the east side of Copper Street between Julthoon Street and Manycats Alley . The compound included two- and three-story buildings. In the Year of the Bloodbird, 1346 DR , Urtos I built a grand house in Ardeep Forest that he called a "hunting lodge", but it had all the comforts of a noble villa. It was used as a private lodge as well as a base for monster hunting expeditions hosted by the Phylunds.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Phylunds were rivals with other Waterdhavian families that had similar interests in exotic beasts, notably the Brokengulfs , the Gundwynds , and the Ilvastarrs , but there were exceptions. Most prominent was the friendship between Urtos II and Prendergast Brokengulf . The lines were further blurred when Prendergast married Urtos II's young stepmother, Aridarye.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Phylund family was of Tethyrian descent and the family was ennobled in the Year of the Ormserpent, 1295 DR . Their status and fortunes rose steadily for decades. The beast-breeding business was lucrative and the monster safaris hosted at the Lodge in Ardeep Forest were quite popular—so much so, that they considered branching out to the Forlorn Hills or the Sword Mountains . The Lodge became the Phylund headquarters for a time until tragedy befell the family in the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR , when Urtos II and nine other members of a hunting expedition were reportedly killed by a large pack of wolves . Days later, Urtos I and six beast-wranglers were killed by an owlbear in the basement of the Field of Triumph , supposedly because the elder Urtos grew careless in his grief and a cage had not been secured properly. In reality, both accidents were deliberately caused at the behest of Aridarye. She planned to take over the family business by having her son, Urtos III, be named heir and herself as regent.</p>
<p>Urtos II did not die in the wolf attack, but he was afflicted with lycanthropy . It took him several tendays to learn that he could remain master of himself during the time of the full moon, but could not control the transformation into a werewolf . Upon hearing news of his father's death, he returned to Waterdeep less than a tenday after the funeral and claimed his birthright as head of the Phyland clan, much to the shock and vexation of Aridarye. Thereafter, Urtos II spent the nights of the full moon at the Lodge and hid his affliction from everyone with the help of Kharkos , a trusted family butler.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR , after more than a decade of vying for his attention, Lady Lythis Mhairuun finally won the affections of Urtos II and they wed. Lythis was shocked to discover his secret after she had followed him to the Lodge during a full moon, but she swore to keep his trust and the wedding proceeded as planned. By the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , she had borne him a son, Tarnos , and two more came later, but all three were declared unfit to inherit the title by the Lords of Waterdeep , presumably because they were feared to be tainted with their father's affliction. Aridarye finally got her wish when the Lords decreed that her son, Urtos III, was the officially recognized heir.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , amid the chaos during the event known has Halaster's Higharvestide , three behirs appeared in the North Ward not far from the Phylund estate. Lord Urtos II and his beast-tamers captured them in good health with minimal property damage and no loss of life.</p>
<p>Eventually, Urtos II's secret was revealed and the family's fortunes waned. All members who were living at the Lodge moved back to the villa on Copper Street as they tried to put uncomfortable events behind them. By the 1480s DR, the Lodge had fallen into disrepair and a Red Wizard necromancer named Thegger Grynn had moved in and began experimenting on the contents of the Phylund family crypts.</p>
<p>By the mid–1490s DR, the Phylunds were still in business and still sponsoring groups of adventurers to hunt and capture beasts for their monster mill.</p>
