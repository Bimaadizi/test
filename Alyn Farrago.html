<p>In the 1480s DR, around the time of the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar and Shadovar invasion of Wheloon , Alyn Farrago was a frequent customer and regular drunkard of the tavern who told the story of the Haunted Halls of Eveningstar to his friends Olmer Twiggins and Zilar Fenner (and a tressym ), and anyone else who passed by. If he managed to snag the attention of passing adventurers (such as those from Eberron , he rambled about the Halls in a tantalizing fashion, describing the old stone door that opened into the ruins that were once used by the bandit lord Rivior . Alyn warned them that according to the stories the ruins were filled with vermin and monsters, and Rivior's ghost might still haunt the place, despite the famed Knights of Myth Drannor clearing the dungeon a century earlier.</p>
