<p>Octons were the third lowest rank among the hierarch modrons .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Octons looked like an elongated cylinder that tapered to a point at the top. Just below this point and on either side they had a set of two eyes and a mouth. About a third of the way down their body was a collar-like "shoulder" ring that encircled their entire body. Attached to this ring were eight evenly-spaced tentacles.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>If forced into combat, an octon used a combination of innate abilities, spells and their tentacles.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like all hierarch modrons, octons had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of clairaudience , clairvoyance , command , dimension door , haste , telekinesis , teleport without error , and wall of force spells at will. Additionally, they were able to duplicate the effects of detect evil and good , haste , telekinesis and water walk spells. Octons were able to cast divine spells from the Law , Protection and War domains. Octons were immune to all effects that influenced the mind and all psionic-based attacks and had a resistance to acid, cold and fire.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>There were exactly 64 octons in modron society. They acted as governors to each of the sixty-four sectors of Nirvana . As such, they were considered responsible for the base modrons of their sector, as well as the decatons and nonatons that were assigned to them. Each octon had a personal staff consisting of one decaton, one nonaton, five pentadrones , sixteen quadrones , eighty-one tridrones , two hundred and fifty-six duodrones , and one thousand, seven hundred and twenty eight monodrones . They maintained small towers, which resembled smaller versions of the towers of the quartons , the secundi , and Primus .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Octons were able to float through air and water with equal ease. Locomotion was provided by forcing either air or water through its collar-like shoulder ring. Due to the position of their eyes, octons had a 360 degree field of vision and could see in darkvision up to 60 ft (18 m). Octons were able to communicate telepathically with any sentient creature within 80 mi (130 km).</p>
