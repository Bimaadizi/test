<p>A taol or toal (either name was correct ) was a Waterdhavian coin worth two gold pieces in the city, but outside Waterdeep these coins were practically worthless.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The toal was a square brass coin with a hole in the center to allow it to be strung on a string. The coin was a square about 2 in (5.1 cm) on a side and the central hole was large enough to fit a nib inside.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , taols could be exchanged for other currency in the Palace of Waterdeep with no exchange fee, but the line was so long that appointments frequently needed to be made a day in advance. The Guild of Trusted Pewterers and Casters and the Jewelers' Guild were also capable of quickly and reliably performing the exchange.</p>
