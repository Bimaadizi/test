<p>The Order of the Steel Fang was an elite militant order within the church of Tempus was founded during the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Contingents of the order―known as Swords of the God―were led by members of the Tempuran church who had previously fought in many battles.</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , the order led by a council of these experienced warriors of Tempus.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The order's members were usually assigned to especially dangerous duties, such as bodyguard work or as protectors of holy relics .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The order was founded in the Year of the Dragon, 1352 DR , by a group of adventuring Tempuran clerics known as the Steel Fang of the God .</p>
<p>Over time, more and more Steel Fangs were conscripted into various non-religious conflicts throughout Chessenta and the Vilhon Reach . They earned great wealth for the church of Tempus but incited displeasure in both senior clergy and Tempus himself.</p>
<p>The conflicted nature of the order came to a head in the Year of the Mages in Amber, 1466 DR , when Steel Fangs were conscripted to opposing sides of a conflict somewhere in the Realms. As members of the order slew each other in battle, Tempus grew so angry he appeared on the battlefield himself. He told his loyal Fangs: "Go home to your altars, and leave these leaderless folk to fight their own battles", before disappearing in a roar of thunder. Tempus' followers obeyed his command and the conflict came to an end. This event came to be known as The Tempuswrath .</p>
<p>The following year , the Order of the Steel Fang was repurposed as an internal disciplinary force, rather than soldiers for hire.</p>
