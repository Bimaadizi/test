<p>Whelp was a commoner who frequented the taproom of the Friendly Arm Inn and lived within the fortified caravanserai or in a nearby community in the mid-14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Whelp was a human man with a light skin tone and brown hair who wore a simple peasant's garb.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As the iron crisis ravaged the Sword Coast in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Whelp was distressed over how it affected the common folk, the "drunkards and gourmands". The affected iron was made into tankards and utensils, making even drinking and dining a troublesome activity. Whelp complained that the inn's tankard handles fell off, spilling his libations.</p>
