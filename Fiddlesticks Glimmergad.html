<p>Fiddlesticks Glimmergad was a gnome musician and a thief of some infamy from the city of Selgaunt , who lived sometime before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Fiddlesticks Glimmergad was a talented bard who used his instrument â€“ Glimmergad's Selgaunt fiddle , to play tear-jerking ballads for bank guards, making them weep so much they never noticed that the gnome's associated were emptying the vault. Little was known of the end of Fiddlesticks's illicit carrier, however, by the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Glimmergad's Selgaunt fiddle was owned by Thomas C. Quirkilious , the dragonborn proprietor of the Chromatic Scale musical instrument shop located on the second floor of The Glitter Gala gem and jewelry vendor of the Lower City .</p>
