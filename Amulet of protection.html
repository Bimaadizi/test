<p>Amulets of protection were enchanted amulets that offered physical protection to their wearers.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Amulets of protection were created in several power levels. They surrounded the wearer with an invisible magical barrier that deflected some of the incoming attacks and improved the wearer's chances of avoiding harm through physical and magical means.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , a halfling "bard" Olive Ruskettle and her partner Jade occasionally ran a scam in the city of Immersea . They claimed that an unsightly item was an amulet of protection and convinced unwitting nobles to purchase it for a hefty price. The same scam came in handy when the scion of House Wyvernspur , Giogioni faced the family's dark secret - an evil spellcaster Flattery Wyvernspur .</p>
