<p>Rillyn was one of the numerous noble families that composed the patriar of Baldur's Gate . While they were considered among the most upstanding, if not particularly interesting families of the Baldurian nobility, they were not without their amoral and misguided relations. The misguided actions taken by one over-ambitious family member led to near-complete financial ruin and disgrace of the Rillyn family name during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>For most of their history the Rillyns had a reputation for being keen investors, as well as rather rather dull and uninteresting individuals. While they maintained their honor among the nobility, they were known to employ agents of the Guild to collect from their debtors.</p>
<p>After losing much of their status and wealth, the family's scion Yvandre Rillyn open the Rillyn School an academy of martial combat and swordsmanship that helped mold a newer generation of swords-for-hire in the city. Yvandre would on occasion recruit guest instructors from among local adventuring companies.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The family's city estate known as Rillyn House had been partially transformed into Rillyn School, an institution that specialized in the training of would-be soldiers, mercenaries and other martial combatants.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Some members of the family held loose ties with the Baldurian criminal syndicate known as the Guild .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Rillyn family fell into misfortune around the time of the Second Sundering , in the Year of the Narthex Murders, 1482 DR . The celebrated mercenary Machil Rillyn was seen to have squandered his family's accumulated wealth on continuing his mercenary lifestyle. In truth, he forced to spend the money on a single casting of a wish spell by the sages of Candlekeep , after he contracted a mysterious curse that his body begin to change into dark glass, inscribed with the language of the fey . While the wish spell worked in removing the curse, Machil was slain by agents of a powerful archfey regent .</p>
<p>Seeing her family without a reliable source of income, Yvandre Rillyn converted her family's manor house to a martial combat academy, founding the Rillyn School in the Year of the Rune Lords Triumphant, 1487 DR . Her efforts began to restore their standing in Baldurian social circles and prevented them from facing financial ruin. Within five years of staring the academy, Yvandre saw herself becoming a rising star within Baldurian politics.</p>
