<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before the Silence of Lolth in 1372 DR , Rhavauz lived in Maerimydra as a follower of Irae T'sarran and was involved in the slaughter of the Lolthites during the Silence. During the invasion of Maerimydra by the forces of Kurgoth Hellspawn on Eleint 23 of 1372 DR , Rhavauz worked with others of the city to defeat the fire giant and goblinoid invaders. When House Chumavh eventually fell, she fled to Szith Morcane and became a guard officer in Dorina T'sarran 's new regime.</p>
<p>By Marpenoth of 1372 DR , Rhavauz had decided to get in touch with her family in Cormanthor and composed a letter to Indrizil hoping it might bring her more allies in Szith Morcane.</p>
