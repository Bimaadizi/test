<p>Like other clerics of his faith, he refused to accept donations and payments for his services, asking for the money, gems, and trinkets to be deposited into the poor box at the temple's entrance. It was a common belief that taking money and valuables for Tymora's aid was in bad luck.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Winefiddle was once a member of the group known as the King's Men that included king Azoun Obarskyr IV. Most of their adventurers remained unrecorded and the curate preferred it to stay that way.</p>
<p>In 1357 DR Alias of Westgate sought help with the mysterious azure magical tattoo, she woke up with one day. The Towers of Good Fortune was the only temple or shrine that was available at the time, due to the late evening time of the day, and the shrine of Tyr being filled with hurt and dead adventurers after their encounter with Mistinarperadnacles Hai Draco . She was greeted by Winefiddle who agreed to cast remove curse on her sword arm. The spell triggered powerful magical defenses on Alias, causing her to lose control of her body and attempt to murder the curate. By Tymora's luck, Winefiddle managed to tumble to safety, accidentally knocking the warrior woman out, but not before she stabbed him in the ribs with a knife. After Alias came to her senses, kind Winefiddle advised searching for a famous sage's help - Lord Dimswart 's. Shortly after she left, her soon-to-be friend Akabar Bel Akash visited Winefiddle as well.</p>
<p>Just a few days later Winefiddle was one of the guests at the wedding between his friend Dimswart's daughter and Frefford Wyvernspur . During the wedding Alias' glyphs were triggered once again causing her to attack the groom's cousin Giogioni Wyvernspur , ruining the wedding.</p>
