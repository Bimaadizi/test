<p>Astalagan was a bronze dragon who was mentioned in the legends about Stormwreck Isle .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Astalagan was one of the three great metallic dragons who defeated the great red dragon Sharruth long before the late 1400s DR . Legends say that he, the gold dragon Clyssavar , and the brass dragon Turadaer joined forces to battle Sharruth and confined her beneath the ocean floor.</p>
<p>It is unknown how exactly Astalagan died, but it was centuries prior to the late 1400s DR. A cloister called Dragon's Rest was built on the site of his death in the cliffs of Stormwreck Isle and it was protected by the remaining draconic magic. In the late 15 th century, Dragon's Rest's elder was Runara , a bronze dragon disguised in human form and Astalagan's daughter. The dragon statue near the monastic cells was dedicated to Astalagan.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Grinning Halfling, 1481 DR , a blue dragon wyrmling named Sparkrender had taken up residence in the Clifftop Observatory on Stormwreck Isle and attempted to harness the power of the island's fallen dragons. For this cause, he ordered his kobold followers Mek and Minn to build and paint sculptures of the five great dragons, Astalagan among them. When a group of adventurers and a bronze wyrmling named Aidron attempted to stop Sparkrender's ritual, the effigy of Astalagan gave them 'Astalagan's Blessing', restoring their health and surrounding them with warmth.</p>
