<p>Bacao Foo was a merchant in Suijeng in Shou Lung in 1358 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bacao Foo was a friendly merchant who sat in restaurants waiting for the start of the Komite . He had made a plan to capitalize on the hungry crowds in the city, selling fresh meat from a herd of cattle that had been driven from Janshi in the south by his cattlemen and slaughtered afterward. He offered anyone a chance to invest in his business, requesting they pay in advance 6 ch'ien per cow; this was three times the normal price but with a guarantee to receive double in return.</p>
