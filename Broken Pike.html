<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A one-story tavern of shabby quality yet average prices, the Broken Pike's patron were a motley crew of fences, pirates, and smugglers. They were a tight-knit bunch who saw all strangers as targets and prey. One had to stay alert and ready for tricks or violence.</p>
<p>Some regulars used the Broken Pike as a venue to plan their crimes, from theft to murder to worse deeds. It was also a meeting place for the Unseen , so some regular patrons were doppelgangers . The duergar fence Thurn Blackskull could be found here many afternoons.</p>
