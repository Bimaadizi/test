<p>The Sea's Bounty was a tavern in Athkatla , located near the city's docks. It contained two floors, both of which were cramped.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The bottom floor contained the bar room, manned by a large man called The Thumb , which was cozy for such a small tavern. It held a large fire burner, sitting areas, bookshelves and many paintings. The bar room was themed around the sea, hence the tavern's name, and attracted many sailors and nobles. Behind a painting was a secret passage to a cavern, where a group of pirates held up.</p>
<p>The top floor was a well furnished common area, containing beds, heat sources and dressers. Commoners, sailors and some nobles would accommodate this floor.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Sea's Bounty Tavern sold a good range of beers, as well as food. Despite its small size, it managed to provide beds for all societal classes.</p>
