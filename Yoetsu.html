<p>Yoetsu was a town located on the island of Kabudono in Kozakura .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The port town of Yoetsu served as a harbor for the wako , where Kozakuran vessels tended to harass them less due to the high concentration of wako junks found there. Kozakuran merchants typically avoided Yoetsu, but smugglers and small traders were drawn to its diverse marketplaces, where they could acquire cut-rate goods. In this bustling port, almost anything could be obtained for a price, as most of the goods sold were the spoils of pirate raids.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Golden Lily , a junk belonging to wako captain Pan Chu , regularly docked in Yoetsu. Captain Pan Chu and other wako captains were often be found in the sake shops and establishments along the waterfront, making them accessible for contact and business dealings.</p>
