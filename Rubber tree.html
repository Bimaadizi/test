<p>Rubber trees , sometimes called rubber plants , were a rare kind of tree found on Toril . They were particularly valuable among Toril's many types of trees .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Rubber trees could be found on the Malatran Plateau , in Maztica , and in particular regions in the far south of Faerûn , notably in the jungles of Chult . They tended to share habitats with cork trees .</p>
<p>Rubber trees were also noted to exist in other crystal spheres , such as on Krynn and Oerth .</p>
<h3>Uses</h3>
<p>The trees were a source of rubber , a congealed product made from their sap. Rubber was harvested and traded by the likes of the Itzas of Far Payit in Maztica and rubber trees were cultivated for rubber by the tribes of Malatra .</p>
<p>Rubber tree sap (sometimes called "uncured rubber") could also serve as a material component in the spells Bowgentle's fleeting journey and erase and was proposed to be useful for creating potions of acid resistance .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the mid-to-late 13 th century DR , heavy harvests of rubber trees had led their populations to dwindle. This led to expeditions delving into the Chultan jungles simply with the goal of finding more of them. Rubber trees were seen as one of Chult's many great treasures, and were prized as far and wide as Amn , Calimshan , Sembia , Tethyr , Thay , and Waterdeep .</p>
<p>Throughout the Amnian occupation of Port Nyanzaru in the 15 th century DR, Chultan rubber trees and timbers were harvested and exported by Amnian trading companies.</p>
