<p>The razor of truth was a magical weapon that could be found in Zakhara , the Land of Fate.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This blade appeared like a regular razor used by barbers in the bazaar.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This blade did not provide any combat benefits to the wielder. However, if used like a normal razor during shaving, it was a useful tool during interrogation. The blade would nick the subject being interrogated every time they told a lie. These cuts were so small that they did not even draw blood. Only three lies could be detected in this manner, after which point the razor behaved like a normal tool for two days before the magic recharged.</p>
