<p>The city below Scourtop was a ruined and abandoned stone settlement on the island of Moray on the slopes of Scourtop . It was so ancient that it was said to be the oldest evidence of civilization in the Moonshae Isles . It had no surviving name (at least in Common ) and the glyphs on its walls and tablets were in a language that was completely forgotten as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The city appeared to have been built by some race of giants , but there was no recognizable statuary or depictions of humanoids , animals , or plants that could be used to identify them save for some evidence that they had worshiped Primordials . It was laid out in a circle, with crumbing and collapsed amphitheaters, forums, and public buildings all constructed in unique geometric designs yet uniformly composed of sharp angles and straight lines. A main road flanked by a double line of columns cut through the city, and all of the harsh angles of the city's structures seemed to indicate or point to the road's end: an enormous square opening in the side of the mountain, inside which was the entrance to a temple of Malar that was even more ancient than the city itself. On the mountain were crypts set into round, grassy hillocks, one of which was a king's tomb.</p>
<p>During rainstorms, water leaked into the subterranean chambers of the city, and slowly but surely was eroding it away.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The city was located in a high, bowl-shaped valley just below the snowcap of Scourtop, the northernmost of the Orcskull Mountains . It was accessed through a narrow tunnel through the rock as one ascended along a mountain path.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Since some unspecified point in the past, Malar tasked his angel of vengeance , Argon Bael , to guard the crypts on the edge of the city. He seemed concerned about whatever lay inside.</p>
<p>After the Spellplague , Malar was seemingly killed, and was interred by Argon Bael within a tomb below Scourtop as the angel worked to fulfill a prophecy to return his god to life. For many years, members of the Black Blood tribe joined the angel in the city to honor their fallen god's memory as he struggled to keep their faith alive.</p>
<p>In the late 1470s DR, Bael and his followers in the Black Blood tribe fulfilled the prophecy by bringing a cleric of the Earthmother ( Merikke ) and an empathic cat-shifter ( Kip ) into Malar's tomb . Following Argon Bael's death at the hand of Merikke and Kip's ally, Bishtek Dlardrageth , this served as a sacrifice worthy of reviving a god, and Malar possessed Kip. Merikke would hesitantly serve "Kip" for several days before being torn apart, while Bishtek and a druid named Eleuthra Davos were imprisoned within a king's tomb before escaping. On his way out, Bishtek raided the king's sarcophagus, claiming many baubles including the king's circlet and a loregem .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h3>King's Tomb</h3>
<p>One of the circular crypts upon the mountain housed a pair of massive sarcophagi , one of which appeared to hold a king of the race that built the city given how the skeleton was dressed in magical gold finery and wrapped in a rainbow burial shroud. By the late 15 th century DR, this sarcophagus had become the lair of a miniature, venomous dragon (no larger than a cat and capable of spitting poison ), which had filled it with additional bones, jewels , and magic items .</p>
<h3>Malar's Tomb</h3>
<p>The city was aligned to a huge square opening in the mountainside, within which was a marble porch built almost to the dimensions of a large cube. In the back of this porch was a cave dug into the mountainside, which was blackened with soot and lined with torches . Deep within was a space that once served as a shrine to Primordial entities, but which later came to be used as a temple and tomb of Malar.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, lycanthropes of the Black Blood tribe occupied parts of the ruins.</p>
