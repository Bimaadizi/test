<p>Arcturiadoom was the 14 th level of the massive dungeon known as Undermountain . It served as the personal retreat and doom of Arcturia , a unique lich who was infamous for being one of the most powerful of Halaster Blackcloak's seven apprentices.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Several of the hallways and alcoves were decorated with statues of Arcturia and Halaster himself. While Arcturia thoroughly made the domain her own, many chambers and rooms featured crypts and foundries, holdovers of the old Melairkyn dwarves . Among these was a large iron tankard that weighed over 1,500 lbs (680.4 kg) and several dwarf-sized statues that had escaped arcane transformation.</p>
<p>As Arcturia herself was a master transmuter , her domain contained a great number of traps that were designed to transmogrify and alter the form of any humanoid creature that happened to set them off. They typically came in the form of magical glyphs , inscribed into the domain's floors. While they could be easily dispelled , they had the potential to possibly alter the form of any interlopers to anything from otyughs to gelatinous cubes and even wyverns .</p>

<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The halls of Arcturiadoom, along the caves outside, were inhabited by several types of creatures and humanoids native to the Underdark . Just outside the front entrance of the archmage's domain, a group of carrion crawlers dwelled within a small garden of luminescent fungi. Giant fire beetles could be found scurrying around the stone floors, and were often thrown together in a large cage to create naturally-powered lanterns.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before Arcturia claimed this domain as her own it existed as part of the subterranean realm of the dwarves of Clan Melairkyn .</p>
<p>Sometime prior to 1492 DR, Emberosa and her fire giant kin came to Arcturiadoom on a mission to aid their efforts in dethroning the storm giants of Faer√ªn within the giants ' ordning . They originally sought an ancient rune of power created some 40,000 years before the Second Sundering , which they believed was stolen by dwarves and taken to their domain beneath Mount Waterdeep .</p>
<p>During their excursion into Undermountain, the fire giants were accompanied by the Death's Head Phalanx band of hobgoblins, led by the Warlord known as Doomcrown.</p>
<p>Within the central hall of Arcturiadoom, the fire giants gathered scrap metal from Trobriand's Graveyard and began construction on an enormous magical-iron automaton called Mecha-Hallaster. This 100' (30.5 m) tall machination was the near-exact duplicate of Halaster himself, though by 1492 DR, it was still incomplete. The Mad Mage intended to use this colossus to combat the Walking Statues of Waterdeep when the time arrived to conquer the surface city.</p>
