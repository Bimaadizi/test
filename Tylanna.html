<p>Lady Sunrise Tylanna of the Seventh Rose was the High Priest of Lathander who oversaw the Morningstar Haven in Westgate in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lady Sunrise Tylanna was in the position of power within the Morningstar Haven by the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , supervising twenty-four members of the clergy of Lathander. Two of these servants of the Morninglord were Tasheni and her beloved paladin Mantides . In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Tasheni disappeared while investigating the Night Masks guild of Westgate, leaving Mantides consumed by grief. On Tylanna's orders, Mantides was sent to the Sword Lane to investigate rumors of a Night Masks safehouse. Instead of returning to Lady Sunrise, Mantides flew into vengeance-fuelled zeal and slaughtered young members of the guild, resulting in Mantides's fall from grace and his expulsion from the Church of Lathander .</p>
