<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Fields of the Dead was a cemetery on a high ground that offered a good view of Suzail and the lands that surrounded it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , furious red dragon Mistinarperadnacles Hai Draco landed in Suzail's Fields of the Dead, demanding information from King Azoun Obarskyr IV about the woman who wronged the ancient Wyrm â€“ Alias of the Azure Bonds. The terrible sight of the dragon could be seen looming above the city walls as she promised to leave the area allowing for caravans' safe passage if the King were to share the whereabouts of the sellsword woman. If Suzail did not comply, Mist was ready to rain destruction. Thankfully, the problem resolved itself with the help of Giogioni Wyvernspur , leading the dragon to Alias and leaving Suzail and the Fields of the Dead undamaged.</p>
