<h2>History</h2>
<p>One day, Rivenhelm was commanding a small band who were assaulted by the Flaming Fist mercenary company, and was mortally wounded. Over the course of the day, the adventurer mercenary Tamper Tencoin —a former member of the Flaming Fist —stood over Rivenhelm in a valiant effort to save his life. Finally, as night fell, the Flaming Fist stepped back and sent their tracking dogs in to savage the stricken defenders in the darkness. Then the dying Rivenhelm thrust Namarra into Tamper's hands and crawled away, shedding blood as he went. Rivenhelm strangled one dog before half a dozen mauled him to death, but Tamper got away. In time, Tamper became famed as the wielder of the Sword That Never Sleeps and was an ally of the Harpers .</p>
