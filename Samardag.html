<p>Samardag the Hoper was a merchant on the Sword Coast just before the Tyranny of Dragons .</p>

<p>Samardag, loyal to his moniker, always saw the good side of each situation. For him, the sky was always blue, the weather was always fine, and tomorrow would always be a better day. He could have been rich if not for his soft heart that led him to help anyone with a pitiful story.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At the start of the Tyranny of Dragons in 1489 Samardag attached his wagon full of fragile porcelain to a great caravan that, unbeknownst to him, was full of Cult of the Dragon agents transporting treasures for the Hoard of the Dragon Queen .</p>
