His death was prophesied to be "under white paws". Eventually, this prediction came to pass when the barbarian was killed in Icewind Dale by a pack of polar bears . The enchanted scale mail was believed to have been buried with its master.</p>
<p>In 1281 DR, Ogien's Scale was found in the Field of Bones of the White Wyrm Iceberg deep in the Sea of Moving Ice . The glacier served as Icasaracht 's lair.</p>
