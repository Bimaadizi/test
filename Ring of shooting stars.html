<p>A ring of shooting stars was an enchanted ring capable of many dazzling effects.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These rings only functioned at night or in near total darkness. Their functions varied depending on if they were used outside or underground.</p>
<p>When used outside at night a ring of shooting stars could perform the following functions: cast dancing lights once per hour, cast light twice per night with a 120 ft (37 m) range, cast ball lightning once per night. The ring could also release "shooting stars" which functioned like the meteors from a meteor swarm spell . Only three shooting stars could be released per week.</p>
<p>When used indoors or underground a ring of shooting stars could cast faerie fire twice per day and emit a "spark shower" once per day. The spark shower released a cloud of sizzling purple energy that enveloped anything within an area 20 ft (6.1 m) long and 10 ft (3 m) wide, electrifying them with deadly lightning.</p>
