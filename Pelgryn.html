<p>Pelgryn was a caravan guard in the Sword Coast during the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Storstil was slain in late 1357 DR , Orthil Voldovan was skeptical of the possibility Shandril Shessair had been the one to kill him by burning his head because, among other reasons, Pelgryn had been between Shandril and the place where the victim was found, and never saw them go between them.</p>
