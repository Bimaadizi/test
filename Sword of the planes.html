<p>A sword of the planes was a type of enchanted sword that grew more powerful depending on where in the multiverse the wielder was.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These swords were typically forged in the form of either a broadsword or longsword .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A sword of the planes would, when on the Prime Material plane act as a standard enchanted sword, but as one traveled further away from the prime material, it got increasingly stronger. On the Inner Planes the difference was marginal, but as one reached the Outer Planes it was quite noticeable. Finally as one arrived on either the Astral Plane or Ethereal Plane the magic within the sword was fully unlocked. Likewise, any creature from the planes would be more greatly wounded as if they were on their home plane. Thus this blade was especially good against those native to the Astral and Ethereal.</p>
<p>Regarding the Domains of Dread , the sword was as powerful as it was for the Ethereal Plane, making it very effective against those who resided in that desolate plane or those natives who crossed over from that foul place.</p>
