<p>Karis was the mad wife of Elden Vargas in Neverwinter in 1479 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Karis was a storm sorceress of Rashemen .</p>
<p>Before the Spellplague , during a diplomatic mission, Karis met and fell in love with the War Wizard of Cormyr , Elden Vargas. They remained always together. However, when it was discovered that Elden had entered into a pact with Asmodeus in order to augment his psychic powers, he was attacked by his fellows. In the battle, Karis tried to protect him and was hit by Ganrahast Aeiulvana and lost her mind.</p>
<p>After moving to Neverwinter, Karis suffered a collapse and, thanks to Mordai Vell , Elden took her to Helm's Hold . She regained a little of her mind in the Cathedral, where Elden conducted a ritual to cure her by absorbing into her a storm. He was defeated by adventurers however, and it was not clear if Karis was cured or not.</p>
