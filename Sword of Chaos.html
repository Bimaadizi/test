<p>The Sword of Chaos was the personal weapon of the Bhaalspawn Deathbringer , Sarevok Anchev .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was believed the sword was crafted specifically for Sarevok.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Sword of Chaos drained the life force of any foe it struck and conferred its wielder. It was imbued with necrotic energy , leaching life from any being it struck and healing the wielder.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sarevok wielded this sword in his fateful battle with his half-sibling in the Bhaalist temple beneath Baldur's Gate .</p>
<p>After Sarevok's death the Sword of Chaos was stored within the city's High Hall . A short time later it was stolen by Sarevok's ally Korlasz and the rest of his followers. They sought to sell the sword to a mysterious figure in order to fund safe passage out of Baldur's Gate.</p>
<p>By the following year , the sword came into the possession of Malaaq the genie enslaved by archmage Jon Irenicus who was willing to exchange the sword for his freedom when dealing with Abdel Adrian . That very same year Sarevok was brought back to some form of life by his half-brother.</p>
<p>At some point over the next century Sarevok was reunited with his favored blade. It remained in his possession as of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR .</p>
