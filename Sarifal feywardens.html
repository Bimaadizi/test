<p>The Sarifal feywardens were highly respected guardians and spies who served the fey realm of Sarifal and its leader, High Lady Ordalf , as of the 15 th century DR . They were renowned as champions of the natural world.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Feywardens kept watch over Sarifal and all of its inhabitants, and pledged to do so for as long as the realm remained on the Material Plane . They were expected to follow and uphold the decrees of High Lady Ordalf, and worked constantly to combat corruption of their realm and any despoiling of the natural world. Their vigil focused mainly on countering threats from denizens of the Feydark, humans from the neighboring realms of the Moonshae Isles , and the Unseelie fey . They preferred to operate in the wilderness, often traveling in small, loosely organized parties led by their eldest members.</p>
<p>A few feywardens served as spies and adventurers beyond the borders of Sarifal. Their duty was not only to protect their realm from without but also to gather intelligence about its enemies.</p>
<p>Within Sarifal, the mightiest feywardens were seen as not only protectors but as representatives of the realm and as champions of the Feywild and of sacred forests across Toril . Experienced members were often sought out for their wisdom and knowledge, and had an extensive understanding of the workings of nature. They taught the importance of living in harmony with nature, and strove to instill this belief into future generations.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Attuned to the natural world and blessed by the bizarre and life-giving energies of the Feywild, the feywardens wielded arcane and primal powers that helped them to traverse difficult terrain with ease and to defend themselves and their homeland. Initiates gained Sarifal's blessing— allowing them to call upon a protective boon that briefly shielded them and their nearby allies from a chosen element —and mastered the ritual of Spirit Fetch by the time they completed their training. As they grew in knowledge and experience, they learned to use primal forces to enhance their natural fortitude.</p>
<p>Depending on where their roles took them, feywardens trained for different contingencies and mastered different magics . They could call upon the powers of both nature and the Feywild to alter their physical and spiritual abilities or to summon powerful and useful fey spirits. For example, they could pop into existence a pixie -like spirit "advisor" who could offer insight, help them speak with animals , and let them see through its senses. Other feywardens could call upon the light of Sarifal , causing them to glow with a Feywild power that distracted and weakened their foes. The most powerful feywardens developed a talent for arcane and fey trickery, allowing them to mimic spells like blur , mirror image , spirits of the shadowed moon , and warlock's leap .</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>Any fey or elf could join the feywardens' ranks (save for drow ), although few high elves aside from the Llewyrr were welcome enough in Sarifal to be counted among their number. Wild and wood elves were most common.</p>
<p>There were no particular skills or abilities that new recruits were required to have, although many wielded primal power or had lived in the Feywild. Junior members operated under the oversight of their mentors, and upon passing a number of initiation tests to become fully independent and trusted feywardens, they were expected to teach and mentor new pupils. The most experienced and renowned feywardens were seen as not only the primary defenders of Sarifal, but as stewards and leaders of the realm, its culture, and its nature.</p>
<p>Feywardens were held to high expectations of discipline, especially by the standards of the fey. Most were well-meaning, and strove to be recognized for their deeds by the fey of Sarifal and especially by their High Lady. Members tended to dislike spending time outside of the wilderness, and saw efforts to tame the wilds as wasteful and untrustworthy. They had a deep reverence for the Earthmother and other primal spirits of the Moonshae Isles. Leaders among the feywardens attracted the direct attention of such spirits, who would visit them and encourage them to support strong and sustainable connections between civilization and nature.</p>
<p>Outsiders often perceived feywardens as fanatical, introverted, and suspicious. Unseelie fey were quick to try to tempt them toward ruin and betrayal.</p>
