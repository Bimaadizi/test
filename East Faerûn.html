<p>East Faerûn bordered the eastern expanses of the Sea of Fallen Stars . Here the sea formed a long arm that traveled to the east before turning south to become the Alamber Sea . The northern nations of this mysterious area were termed by some people as the Unapproachable East and the southern nations the Old Empires , and, for a time, the Empires of the Alamber Sea . Many of these nations allowed slavery , and depended on slaves for much of their economy.</p>
