<p>Masks of Death were enchanted masks worn by Myrkulytes and later, by Cyricists .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Masks of Death were items carved of ivory and shaped to resemble a human skull.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Magic imbued into Masks of Death allowed the wearer to access several spells once per day each. The wearer could shroud themselves in death armor and could sap life force with a mere touch as by the vampiric touch spell. The most dangerous property was when a Mask flew off the wearer's face and bit into a target at the wearer's bidding. If successful, the bite functioned as the finger of death spell. A Mask of Death flew back onto the owner's face when the attack was completed.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally, Masks of Death were created to be used by several sects that worshiped Myrkul . After the deity's death during the Time of Troubles , followers of Cyric started claiming the items as their own. In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , one such Mask belonged to Mephasm , a pit fiend trapped and forced into service by the warlock Ammon Jerro . Only the most cunning and charismatic individuals could haggle the magic item from the creature.</p>
