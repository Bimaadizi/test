<h2>History</h2>
<p>On one campaign, Horoko and his comrades had too much sake and went to a tattoo parlor. Horoko wound up with his tattoo, and couldn't recall how or why.</p>
<p>He later hung up his sword and began a new career as a landscape gardener in Aru. However, when he visited public baths in Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR) , his tattoo may have been misidentified by adventurers as the similar flame-knife tattoo of the Yamaguchi ninja clan, which could lead to conflict.</p>
