<p>Captain Schael Corwin was an officer of the Flaming Fist during the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Schael was quite a free spirit in her younger years and tested her father's composure and emotional fortitude. Her exploits even got her into trouble with the soldiers whose ranks she would later join.</p>

<p>For a short while she worked alongside an elven wizard named Zeri .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
