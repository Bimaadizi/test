<p>The Becloaked were a group of eerie and enigmatic druids who inhabited The Archdruid's Grove in Mosstone .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Druids only known as the Becloaked were truly a mysterious bunch. These individuals of unknown gender wore gray-colored thick, heavily-cowled robes that completely obfuscated their features, faces, and showed no skin.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>Three of these Becloaked druids were always seen patrolling the Archdruid's Grove under the commands of the Archdruid himself. The Becloaked slowly walked their strange routes, and no one seemed to know the patrols' purpose. On occasions, they gathered around a random tree and stayed motionless for several minutes until resuming the route. The Becloaked spoke rarely and always in harshly whispered questions when addressed, like "Don't you have anything better to do?" Young acolyte druids tended to avoid the Becloaked, moving to the opposite side of a path and scattering out of the robed figures' way. On the other hand, the watchghosts that inhabited the Archdruid's Grove paid the Becloaked no mind.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to Volothamp Geddarm 's testimony recorded in the infamous writer's guide to Amn and Tethyr published in the late 14 th century DR , he once witnessed a glimpse of a Becloaked's hand â€“ covered in tiny green iridescent scales. However, Volo was unsure if what he saw was simply a lightly-fitted glove.</p>
