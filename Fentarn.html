<h2>History</h2>
<p>Fentarn held a party in the Year of the Black Flame, 229 DR , in which one of the servers was replaced by Farl , a local thief, who intended to hear something of import regarding trade in and out of the city.</p>
<p>After the Magister Dorgon Heamiiolothtar was summoned into Havilyn 's house and slew a number of his guests during a banquet, he ran out to Fentarn's home and told him something that had all the armsmen escort guests out of the house. Farl later told as much to his comrade Eladar the Dark, actually the prince Elminster Aumar in disguise.</p>
