<h2>Location</h2>

The innkeeper Crow made deals with the local ranking Red Wizards , and in exchange they deflected any official trouble that might fall onto his establishment.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The tavern had the services of its own barber, Thethro , and a tattooist and piercer, Xamik . Piercings usually required the client to be drunk on ale and held down by several other patrons as Xamik worked.</p>
