<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the early 1360s DR , age 30, Kallithrea Starbrow was one of the members of the Sunite clergy in the Skull Crag Keep 's Chapel of Lady Firehair. After Kallithrea's mother perished in a devious monster attack, the priestly daughter was considered for the position of the Roadwarden. Kallithrea did not think she was fit to be the steward of the keep as the youth felt she liked a steeled heart of a warrior . However, she also thought her siblings did not possess the required strength of character to take on the job. With Arelin Starbrow's death, the Arms of the Roadwarden were lost and scattered by the monster horde. Kallithrea was tasked with the recovery of the Shield of the Roadwarden. She was aided in the task by a group of caravan guards who recently saved Sir Dutiocss life. Not being an adventuring type, Kallithrea sent her companion half-elf Arderiel in her stead.</p>
<p>When Morudel, Kallithrea's father, was kidnapped by the villainous vampire Keremish and help hostage in a hin village across the Tunlands , Yemandra was furious. The undead demanded the Arms of the Roadwarden in exchange for Morudel's life, yet Yemandra was adamant that the magic set was to remain within the Skull Crag Keep and the Roadwarden Guard need to prepare an assault to avenge Morudel. While Kallithrea called for the siblings to give up the Arms of the Roadwarden to save what was left of their family.</p>
