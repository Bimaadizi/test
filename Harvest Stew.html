<p>Harvest Stew was a communal potato dish cooked and served during the New Harvest Festival in Purfbin Doogrick 's home burrow.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Harvest Stew was a highlight of the annual New Harvest Festival, a grand gnomish feast. The stew preparation required copious amounts of potatoes, peeled and chopped, which was a task performed by the youths of the burrow. One unfortunate year, sometime before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the celebration and the potato shredding was turned into a disaster thanks to Purfbin Doogrick and his Shred-o-Matic 1000 .</p>
