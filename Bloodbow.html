<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Bloodbow was laid to rest long before the fall of Myth Drannor during the Weeping War , in the Elven Catacombs deep underneath Castle Cormanthor . Arianna the Archer was one of the ancient elven heroes interred within one of the crypts within the catacombs. In 1369 DR , the Bloodbow was still within its mistress' sarcophagus. Arianna's spirit, along with several other heroes' in the same crypt, was still trapped inside the ruined city and corrupted by the magics of the Weeping War. If the Bloodbow were to be removed from the sarcophagus, Arianna's wraith was there to punish the grave-robbers.</p>
