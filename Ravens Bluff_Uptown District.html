<p>The Uptown District of Ravens Bluff was an expansive area within the city, home to many noble manors, mercantile halls and long stretches of row-houses alike. From the glorious Lake Christina in the northeastern section of the city, to the magnificent coliseum in the older part of the city near the eastern gate, and the often-disregarded streets of the Skymbles , Uptown was a vast district, home to the wealthiest and most forgotten Ravenian citizens.</p>
<p>The district stretched from the northwestern corner of the city, across the north wall, and down the eastern border of the city facing the Ravenian farmlands. The district had five distinct neighborhoods. While they shared a tremendous amount of wealth, they each had a distinct character unique to their streets, highly shaped by the city's grand history.</p>
<h2>Neighborhoods</h2>
<h3>Torchtown</h3>
<p>Formerly known as Urngaff , this neighborhood in the northeast corner of the city was a vibrant and ever-changing locale, heavily influenced by the nearby Market District . Its big draws were a number of well-off businesses and merchant houses that conducted their business therein.</p>
<h3>Sixstar</h3>
<p>This luxury neighborhood was a quiet, serene part of the city, well-patrolled by the Ravenian City Watch , who were aided by their trained war dogs. It held a number of noble houses, a few thriving businesses, and the beautiful and tranquil Lake Christina.</p>
<h3>Tentowers</h3>
<p>Named for the grand architecture that stretched into the skies above the Bluff, Tentowers was the richest of the city's neighborhoods. While seemingly every street was lined with a number of noble manors and estates, it also featured the Stane Opera House on Waelstar Way and a particularly charming shop for those who enjoyed the game of chess .</p>
<h3>Mortonbrace</h3>
<p>Known primarily for being the area "where the Coliseum is", this neighborhood was often disregarded by locals and visitors alike, especially given its proximity to the opulence of Sixstar and Tentowers. The majority of its noteworthy buildings were private residences, although a few merchant houses set up shop within its streets.</p>
<h3>Skymbles</h3>
<p>Even more overlooked than Mortonbrace , this neighborhood was outright forgotten by most of the citizens of Ravens Bluff. It had a mere handful of notable locations, such as the district's courthouse and the detested Shrine of Honest Toil , but was mostly home to small homes and clustered apartments, where the laborers of the Bluff lived in absolute squalor.</p>
