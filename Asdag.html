<p>Ruinlord Asdag was the head of internal security and head torturer of the Zhentarim in 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Asdag was a cold and cruel person.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Asdag was a cleric, first as a High Priest of Bane , then Cyric , and later of Iyachtu Xvim , always following his master, Fzoul Chembryl .</p>
<p>Around 1367 DR , he was the adviser of Guthbert Golthammer , military commander of Teshwave , but in truth he directed Guthbert's decisions, being the real lord of the dale.</p>
<p>Later, Asdag was transferred to Zhentil Keep , where he assumed a position as head of internal security, just under Fzoul. He used this position to spy inside Xvim's clergy, on Lord Orgauth , and other power groups in the city for his master.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Asdag was a fat and tall man with a preference for black dress with crimson cloaks. He cultivated this look in order to inspire an air of evil power.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>In his days in Teshwave, Asdag often found it incredibly easy to manipulate the slow-witted mind of Guthbert. However, Guthbert considered him a loyal advisor.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Asdag was loyal to Fzoul.</p>
