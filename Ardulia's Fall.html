<p>Ardulia's Fall was a magical mace that allowed the wielder to slow their opponents with every blow.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The weapon was wielded by a priest of the Sword Coast named Itgan . It earned its name when the extremely quick and deadly raider named Ardulia came to Itgan's village, and challenged the devout clergyman to one-on-one battle for control of his home. While Ardulia was renowned for his agility and prowess in battle, he met his match when he was repeatedly bludgeoned by Itgan's mace, unable to endure the priest's steady blows.</p>
<p>At some point, it came into the possession of the clerics of Helm within the city of Athkatla , as of the year 1369 DR .</p>
