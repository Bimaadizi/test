<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sergor was a sergeant in Damara's army, stationed at a small garrison in the Tomrav village, near the Monastery of the Yellow Rose . In 1491 DR , despite an alliance with a local goblin tribe, a large group of bugbears , led by Hrar , attacked the village and captured many hostages, seizing control of the village and the road to the monastery. Eventually, an adventuring party hired for a mission at the monastery defeated a bugbear patrol, and Sergor then asked their help to free the hostages, including his family, and to defeat the bugbears.</p>
