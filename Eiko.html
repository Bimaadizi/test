<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1608 ( 1190 DR ), Eiko officially recognized the settlement around the Shining Temple of Bishamon and named it Aru after the Aru river . Furthermore, he decreed it the capital of the new Aru Province (cleaved off the existing Jasuga Province ) and appointed Arata Matsutomo , head of the completely loyal Matsutomo clan, as its first daimyo ; the Matsutomos dutifully relocated to Aru.</p>
