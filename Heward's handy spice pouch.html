<p>Heward's handy spice pouch was a magic pouch that was able to produce any food seasoning.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The item resembled an ordinary, empty belt pouch.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Someone holding the pouch could reach into it and speak the name of any type of nonmagical seasoning— salt , pepper , saffron etc.—and produce enough of that seasoning to apply to a single meal. This power could be used up to ten times until the pouch recovered its magic at the next dawn.</p>
