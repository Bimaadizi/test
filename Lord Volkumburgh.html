<p>Lord Volkumburgh was a Cormyrian noble in the 11 th to 12 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 999 DR , Lord Volkumburgh acquired a villa within the Thunder Peaks in a valley that would come to be known as Volkumburgh Vale . In the mid-12 th century DR, a unique stone golem known as Awtawmatawn rampaged throughout the valley. Before it could sack his home, the lord hid his treasure in a secret cavern underneath it.</p>
<p>Inevitably, the Awtawmatawn came through and sacked his villa. His manor would later be rebuilt and come to be an inn known as the Crimson Wyrm . The rest of its remains were used to construct a small village that would bear his name and he became its first headman.</p>
<p>Later on, some man would approach Lord Volkumburgh with one of the hands of the Awtawmatawn and task him with hiding it. He went on to hide it beneath the village's fountain and both this, as well as his hidden treasure, would continue to be spoken of as local legends in Volkumburgh well into 1358 DR .</p>
