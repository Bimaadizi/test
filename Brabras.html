Unknown for him, they were being pursued by the fugitive wizard Elminster Aumar ; Brabras was quickly disabled after the mage conjured a veil of darkness around him, then enspelled him into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>After his master found him sleeping, Elminster, then impersonating Morligul Downdagger, told him that Brabras had been laid low by a wench, and that Rorn had gone off to chase her.</p>
