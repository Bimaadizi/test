<p>Chauntea's Citadel was a fortress on Harvestshield Mountain that stood in ruins as of the late 15 th century DR , at which time it came to be occupied by Mrolgyet's Legion . The citadel was named for Chauntea , the goddess of agriculture.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Citadel was most safely accessible via a path on the south side of the mountain. It sat atop a tunnel connecting it to the Heartcoil Deeps , a region of the Underdark beneath Harvestshield Mountain. As of the late 15 th century DR, it also contained a tunnel dug by the Snarlclaw trolls that connected the Citadel to the Frostsilver Mines .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The wizards of the ancient Citadel created a number of golems to defend the area, notably a single wizard created a force of flesh golems known as " Harvestshield Reapers " to protect the farmlands from raiders, while other wizards created stone golems known as " Heartcoil Guardians " to patrol the tunnels connecting the Citadel to the Underdark. These various golems were designed to only acknowledge their creators' commands, and those of them still active as of the late 15 th century DR treated everyone as an enemy.</p>
<p>With the arrival of Mrolgyet's Legion in the late 15 th century DR, the fortifications were greatly repaired and expanded in order to defend it from both attacking armies and raging dragons .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to the arrival of the red dragon Argathakul between the late 8 th and early 15 th century DR, Chauntea's Citadel was dedicated to defending the fertile farmlands that sat at the base of Harvestshield Mountain. To that end, the wizards of the Citadel created constructs to defend both the farmers and the Citadel itself. During this time, the Citadel weathered an uprising by a legendary rebel known as Bellorath , who fled to the Heartcoil Deeps after his defeat.</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, the Citadel was claimed by the hobgoblin warlord Mrolgyet and his Legion, who set about fortifying it, subjugating or recruiting allies, and planning for an invasion against the Lords' Alliance . The Legion was defeated and scattered by the combined efforts of a Lords' Alliance army and a band of adventurers in the service of the Open Lord of Waterdeep , Laeral Silverhand .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>With the arrival of Mrolgyet's Legion in the late 15 th century DR, the Citadel was used to garrison a large force of goblinoids and giantkin , as well as the occasional chimera .</p>
