<p>The Tribe of the Wolf was a nomadic group of Reghedman barbarians living in the tundra of Icewind Dale .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Tribe of the Wolf took part in the Battle of Icewind Dale in the Year of the Crown, 1351 DR under the leadership of Wolf King Beorg . The Wolf tribe suffered the most deaths out of any of the Reghedman tribes in the battle and soon lost much of its influence, becoming a minor tribe. With Beorg lacking any heir, the role of leadership fell to the tribe's shaman Jütti Merliss .</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , with the tribe low on food during an early onset of winter Jütti called out to evil deities for salvation and had her pleas answered by Malar . He chose a warrior in her tribe by the name of Isarr Kronenstrom to have the opportunity of becoming his Chosen .</p>
<p>By the time of the War of the Silver Marches , the Tribe of the Wolf was severely weakened and had been leaderless for a few years. Although Chieftain Isarr Kronenstrom assumed the title of Wolf King for himself, other tribesmen did not recognize his authority.</p>
<p>Unlike the other Reghedmen tribes, the Tribe of the Wolf did not live peacefully with the people of the Ten Towns in the years following the war.</p>
