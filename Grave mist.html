<p>A grave mist was a very rare type of undead that gathered around burial grounds. These creatures had a strong link to the Negative Energy plane .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Grave mists appeared as swirling mists of grey hue of somewhat humanoid forms, and existed both on the Negative Energy Plane and the Material Plane . Their eyes were only represented by dark holes. When gathered in groups, some may have mistaken them for fog or smoke.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Due to their link to the Negative Material Plane, grave mists could drain their foes of their vitality. Similarly to wraiths , their chilling touch would weakened foes and even cause them to become immobile. As per other undead, grave mists could not be put to sleep , charmed , held , or be affected by cold-based spells . Only magical weapons could hurt these unique undead. Instead of just being immune to cold spells, they would actually heal from such effects.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>These intelligent undead beings usually formed societies of up to four. As grave mists literally feasted on corpses, their societies would be based in graveyards or other burial sites. As they were not living, and only feasted on dead organisms, grave mists had no place in the food chain. Their society put no value on objects that humanoids would usually covet, such as gold or items. No leaders were elected among grave mists.</p>
