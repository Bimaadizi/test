<p>The Sheir Peninsula was a peninsula in Lapaliiya in southwest Faerûn . It marked the northeastern border of the realm.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It was a massive granite outcrop extending westward into the Shining Sea , bordered by cliffs that stood over 20 feet (6 meters) tall. It lay between Ormpur Bay on the north and Sheir Bay in the south.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Around 1373 DR , the peninsula was dotted with thorps home to local shepherds. Forced to pay exorbitant rents to the Overking of Lapaliiya to use the land, these folk were often poverty-stricken.</p>
<p>The cliff faces, meanwhile, were inhabited by harpies . These creatures preyed on ships at sea, and the shepherds went nowhere near the coast.</p>
<p>On the northern foot stood the city of Ormpur and on the southern foot stood Sheirtalar .</p>
