<p>The Spear of Kerish was the aptly named enchanted spear wielded by Kerish , the frost salamander leader of the Wyrm's Tooth glacier on the Spine of the World .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Spear of Kerish was a truly unusual polearm . It was constructed out of an unknown light and transparent crystalline material. The weapon's spearhead appeared to be a frozen icicle affixed onto the crystalline haft. The weapon radiated a mist of fine ice crystals. When wielded in combat, the Spear of Kerish functioned as an enchanted +3 spear that occasionally dealt additional magical cold damage. While holding the weapon, its owner became somewhat resistant to mundane and magical fires.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , the Spear of Kerish was wielder by Kerish, who resided in the Aquatic Museum deep in the Wyrm's Tooth glacier. The frost salamander leader allied himself with the Revered Brother Poquelin , who sought ruination and conquest of Icewind Dale . Eventually, Poquelin was defeated by a group of heroes. However, the fate of the Spear of Kerish and the frost salamander remained uncertain.</p>
