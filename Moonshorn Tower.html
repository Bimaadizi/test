<p>Moonshorn Tower was a temple to Mystra in the mid–8 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Moonshorn Tower stood somewhere between Tresset's Ringyl and the Riven Stone .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The squat tower looked like a giant stump; there were phases of Selune carved around its great black door, which was many-strapped and bolted. There were battlements along the top.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The entrance led into a rather small chamber with a lectern as large as a door. There were three closed doors behind the lectern. One door, with a pull-ring, led to plain, smoothly worn stairs that granted entry into the higher levels. At least one of the rooms in the tower held tables and bookshelves in which were stored an immense cache of writings and knicknacks, many of which were Netherese in origin.</p>
<p>A narrow back stair led from the third door at the base to the top of the tower.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Visitors to the tower, or at least the ones who served Mystra, were allowed to examine the collection at Moonshorn. However, they were required to surrender all their magic to the Guardian's care. Food wasn't provided, but water could be taken from the font.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>As of 761 DR , the mage Mardasper Oblyndrin had been the Guardian of the tower for two years. The Guardian of the Tower was granted the use of the Scepter of the Lady , and of a similarly enchanted diadem with powers of truth-reading.</p>
<p>Wards were present to forewarn the guardian of any trouble, and made the doors almost impossible to force open; they also prevented magic from lingering in it contingently. Translocations didn't work inside Moonshorn.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>One spring morning in the Year of Laughter, 761 DR , Elminster Aumar , a Chosen of Mystra , passed through Moonshorn Tower in his quest to find the Lady of Shadows, Dasumia . He briefly crossed paths with Mardasper Oblyndrin , and with the sages Tabarast and Beldrune .</p>
<p>After discovering that Elminster had just passed them, the two sages crept after him. The elf Ilbryn Starym , who was hunting after Elminster, turned up late in the evening; Mardasper met him despite the hour, with a diadem over his burning eye and the scepter on his head. Though the visitor did not accept the rules of the Tower, he nonetheless learned Elminster had been there by morning, and left without further trouble. Mardasper, in turn, was attacked and slain shortly after by the Slayer .</p>
