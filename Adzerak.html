<p>Adzerak was a book-obsessed lich who laired in the ruins of his home at Barrenstone in northern Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As a lich, Adzerak wore tattered purple robes. His body was decrepit and rotted, with only a few strands of hair on his head and only one of his eyes remaining.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>As a living man, Adzerak was singularly focused on expanding and preserving his collection of books. Fittingly, he was devoted to Deneir , the patron of books and knowledge.</p>
<p>Unlike most liches, Adzerak was not particularly cruel or malevolent, but was completely focused on protecting his books at all costs. The degeneration inflicted on him by his lichdom ritual made him absent-minded and forgetful, even to the point of making him forget his devotion to Deneir.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Despite his poor condition, Adzerak remained lucid enough to keep a full array of combat-focused spells. Entirely devoted to the purpose of protecting his books, his spells were chosen to annihilate the target and not damage the surrounding environment. They included Bigby's crushing hand , Bigby's clenched fist , finger of death , flesh to stone , and prismatic wall .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>In his lifetime Adzerak accrued a vast fortune, which he mostly used to buy expensive and rare books. He didn't manage to spend it all before he became a lich, and a significant treasure hoard remained. In addition to approximately 44,000 gp in currency, 10,000 gp in diamonds , and a variety of lesser magical items, he also had possession of the sentient short sword Imp , and the dagger Deathsend of the Four from Cormyr .</p>
<p>The books he gathered up included common fiction, academic works, and arcane treatises.</p>
<p>He had also obtained powerful magical tomes.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Adzerak had an arch-rival in the form of Melkerech , another lich who also had a penchant for books. Melkerech regularly scryed on Barrenstone, and considered all the treasures within to be rightfully his. When Adzerak was destroyed and his lair looted, Melkerech became affronted and began to draw plans to reclaim "his" books from the adventurers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During his life in the 11 th century DR , Adzerak had his home Barrenstone built and took on four apprentices. As he grew older, he became convinced that the only way he could protect his beloved tomes was to become a lich and guard them eternally. Although he became a lich, the ritual was flawed and accidentally killed his apprentices and transformed them into wights , and degraded his mind such that he was reduced to obsessively lurking in his sanctum surrounded by his gathered books.</p>
<p>When adventurers gained entry into Barrenstone in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , they reminded him of his devotion to Deneir, and suggested that he store his tomes in the sanctified shrine nearby. This prompted a joyful revelation in the lich, and Adzerak immediately began moving his collection to the shrine. Once completed, Deneir reached out and took Adzerak's spirit up into his bosom, along with most of his books. Adzerak was thus released from his obsession-wracked lichdom, and entered the afterlife as a whole and clear-sighted man.</p>
