<p>A tindertwig was an alchemical tool used to easily light fires.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was a tiny wooden stick with an alchemical substance applied to one end.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When the alchemical substance was struck against something rough, it ignited automatically, much quicker than a flint and steel , let alone with a magnifying glass , and without additional tinder. They made lighting torches and other fires easier and faster.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Related to alchemist's fire and smokesticks , tindertwigs required skill in alchemy and spellcasting to make.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Tindertwigs were worth 1 gp each. They were sold among various adventuring supplies, such as by Undermountain merchant Malvar around 1375 DR .</p>
<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
<p>Cogol and Harrik , two ranger followers of Malar circa 1372 DR , tied tindertwigs to their smokesticks for ready ignition.</p>
<p>Five tindertwigs were also part of the equipment of a Zhentarim acolyte of Bane that same year.</p>
<p>Gyudd of Gyudd's Distillery in Skullport kept ten of them as part of his equipment in 1375 DR.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Five tindertwigs and a vial of alchemist's fire were found behind some deathsbreath mushrooms in Hekkut the Molted 's bandit base in the Delimbiyr Vale in 1372; it's unknown why they were there.</p>
<p>A hundred tindertwigs were part of a cargo of supplies sent from Waterdeep to Swordhold in 1372 DR.</p>
