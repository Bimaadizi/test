<p>Indurr Stalnstern , nicknamed "Warsword", was a farmer in Red Larch circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . He was a former mercenary that retired and started a cattle ranch. He owned grazing land just north of the town off the Long Road . It could be reached by turning east at Nurnath 's big chicken barn with the green-tile roof onto the cart track that led to Old Angrath's Smokehouse . Indurr's pastures were on one side of the lane across from Mragan Gulther 's orchards. The road ran for about a mile before dead-ending atop Angrath Dree 's hill.</p>
