In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR after the disappearance of the storm giant king Hekaton , all of the giant lords took to reshape the ordning to their own fitting. Zalto first led his minions to reclaim Ironslag in the North Faer√ªn , the greatest forge of ancient Ostoria , planning to reconstruct the ancient colossus construct Vonindod , a relic of the Thousand Year War , and unleash it upon the hated dragons .</p>
<p>However, Zalto eventually came to understand that a flame stronger than Ironslag's was required to awaken Vonindod. He then proceeded to forge an alliance with the drow of House Xorlarrin in order to gain the fire primordial Maegera with the hopes of using it's powers to complete Vonindod.</p>
