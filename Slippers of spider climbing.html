<p>Slippers or boots of spider climbing were magical boots that allowed their wearer to effortlessly walk on vertical surfaces, or upside-down along ceilings, leaving their hands free.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Often unremarkable in appearance, slippers of spider climbing gave off a faint aura of alteration magic.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Slippers of spider climbing were typically not effective on slippery surfaces, such as ice, or surfaces coated in oil or grease. Following the Spellplague , boots of spiders climbing lost their sticky properties, instead merely enhancing their wearer's ability to climb. However, the item was reverted to its traditional state after the Second Sundering .</p>
