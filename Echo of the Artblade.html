<p>The Echo of the Artblade was a powerful longsword derived from the legendary Artblade , found in the ruins of Myth Drannor in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Echo was a deadly and fine weapon in its own right, though only a shadow of the true Artblade . It made the wielder a more powerful and precise spellcaster, granted them true sight and immunity to blindness, and even afflicted attackers with temporary nullmagic in response to magical assaults.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The weapon originated when the Artblade's own nature turned against itself, shedding a small part of its own power as an echo that formed as a lesser blade, also creating the armor of the Warblade . This Echo was potentially found during the reclamation of Myth Drannor, and was willing to be wielded by non-elves. If the Red Wizards of Droic Orgul managed to infuse it with the necromantic energies of the dracolich Karliath , the blade's strength of will would overcome the corruption and remain a tool of righteousness.</p>
