<p>Around the year 769 DR , the hero Zachiira appeared before King Strohm III , requesting aid to defeat an extremely powerful demonic vampire . The king's advisor, the great and powerful Theurgist Karlash Arnostognas , commissioned the creation of the ring of purity for the brave adventurer. While Zachiira was able to defeat the fiend , her victorious return home was overshadowed by the death of the mighty king. She placed the artifact at the base of King Strohm's tomb, where it was eventually stolen by impudent travelers.</p>
