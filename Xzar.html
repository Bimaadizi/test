<p>Xzar was an insane necromancer and a member of the Zhentarim who traveled the Sword Coast during the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Xzar was both intelligent and insane at the same time. He was quite unbalanced and would randomly spout gibberish at unpredictable moments; at one moment he could act like a frightened child while the next he may remark that he ate another person's liver paired with beans and a nice wine .</p>
<p>His treatment of others was usually coldly disdainful or derisive.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Zhentarim partnered Xzar with the halfling Montaron , a pairing that was made against both their wishes. Xzar found 'Monty' to be quite insufferable, while he in turn thought Xzar completely mad. After some time however, it appeared as if the two had developed genuine care for one another.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Xzar and Montaron were tasked by the Zhentarim to investigate the iron crisis that plagued the Sword Coast . They traveled south along the Coast Way to the Amnian town of Nashkel .</p>
<p>By the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Xzar and Montaron had traveled to Athkatla to spy on the local group of Harpers led by Galvarey . At that time Xzar had employed a pair of apprentices, Prebek and Sanasha . The trio were conducting experiments involving the creation of horrific monsters.</p>
<p>Montaron was captured by the Harpers at some point and to Xzar's knowledge was taken to the local Harper Hold . While Xzar sought a means to rescue his friend, Montaron had in fact already been killed.</p>
