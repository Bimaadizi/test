<p>The Tilver Stairs was one of three major pedestrian stairs that connected the Lower City and the Old Town in the Cormyrean city of Tilverton .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Tilver Stairs were the southern stairs, while the Market Stairs was in the middle of the city, and the Cormyr Stairs stood on Tilverton's western side. The stair climbs were the only way into the richer, less crowded Old Town apart from passing the Upper City Gate . The Tilver Stairs were part of the Street of the Sorceress that twisted and turned across both parts of the city, and it was along the stairs that visitors and locals could reach the landing where stood the Green Altar and its circular garden dedicated to Silvanus , the Oak Father.</p>
