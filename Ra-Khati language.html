<p>Ra-Khati , or Ra-Khatian , was the language spoken by the people of Ra-Khati in Kara-Tur .</p>
<p>It was of the Shou Chiang languages group, being related to the Kao te Shou and Khazari languages . The languages were mutually intelligible, similar enough for a speaker of one to understand the other, yet different enough to count as separate languages.</p>
<p>Ra-Khati was slightly influenced by the Solonese dialect of Devic , spoken in Solon .</p>
<p>In Ra-Khatian, the title Dalai Lama meant "ocean spirit father" while the name Sandiraksiva translated to "He who refuses to carry the Dalai Lama". "Nyum" was a Ra-Khatian concept combining spirit, courage, and audaciousness, most similar to chutzpah .</p>
