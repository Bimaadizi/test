<p>Smoke mephits were mephits composed of air and fire .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These elusive elemental hooligans appeared to be composed of fiery cinders amidst hot air. They had wings—allowing them to fly as fast as they could move on land—and sharp claws.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>They were crude and lazy, as well as liars and tricksters who thrived on mockery and misdirection. They typically had massively overinflated egos.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>One each day, smoke mephits could cast dancing lights and could summon one to four other smoke mephits (although the summons worked only once in every four attempts). These summoned mephits appeared within 60 feet (18 meters) of the summoner and disappeared after 1 minute, when the summoner died, or when the summoner released them.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Smoke mephits used their claws to attack their enemies, as well as an ability known as their cinder breath in which they exhaled smoldering ash that blinded those hit by it. These mephits were not particularly hardy, but had a complete immunity against fire and poisons . When a smoke mephit died, a cloud of smoke with a radius of 5 feet (1.5 meters) appeared. This cloud obscured the vision of other creatures.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Smoke mephits were servants of Vhaeraun , the drow god of thievery, and were sent by him to Toril .</p>
