<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time before meeting the Kalach-Cha , Zachan received an amulet from his father. This amulet was passed down to his father from his grandfather. The amulet was enchanted and increased constitution and will.</p>
<p>Zachan was in Weeping Willow Inn when he was attacked by bladelings and duergar . Gera , his wife, asked the Kalach-Cha to rescue him. Once Zachan was rescued, both of them headed for Highcliff .</p>
<p>In Highcliff, he and his wife worried about their lost sons, Alex and Andrew . If the Kalach-Cha saved the boys from wolves at Highcliff Castle , Zachan admitted he told his sons stories to give them more confidence. Nevertheless, he would reward the Kalach-Cha with his amulet.</p>
<p>Finally, the Kalach-Cha encountered Zachan again on the way to Highcliff after the King of Shadows launched his attack. Zachan and Gera would thank the Kalach-Cha and explain what was going on in Highcliff.</p>
