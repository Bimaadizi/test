<p>Sword Saint Legacy was a variety of enchanted katana created on the Sword Coast North in the late 14 th century DR , with the original and the most powerful variety being a unique weapon from Kara-Tur that housed the spirit of Master Kendai Kousra .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>There existed three variants of the Sword Saint Katana , each possessing +1 , +4 , or +8 enchantments what made the sword 's edge deadlier and guided the wielder's hand towards the target. All three versions were made to deal extra sonic damage to evil and malicious individuals.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>A Sword Saint Legacy could be created from an enchanted katana and a slab of adamantite .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was believed in Kara-Tur that a master warrior's ultimate challenge was death. As such, many noble heroes sacrificed their mortal shells and placed their spirits within ancestral katanas, making them as powerfully enchanted as the warrior's spirit that inhabited the weapon. It was believed that the great Master Kendai Kousra performed such a ritual sometime long before the late 14 th century DR, placing their spirit in the Sword Saint Legacy katana. Legends claimed that the blade became so powerful that a deity claimed it as his favorite weapon.</p>
<p>More common versions of Sword Saint Katanas with a simpler +1 enchantment were forged by Master Blacksmith Marrok of the Shining Knight Arms and Armor shop in Neverwinter to help the heroes who sought the cure for the dreaded Wailing Death in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Later the same year, more powerful versions were created by Master Blacksmith Barun of Beorunna's Well to help the forces of Neverwinter stand against Lady Aribeth the Betrayer , who led a marching army of Luskan in the deadly but short-lived Neverwinter-Luskan war.</p>
