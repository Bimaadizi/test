<p>Dragomir the Red was a power-hungry vampire warlord who commanded armies both in life and during undeath .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was known to command both admiration and fright from his followers.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>After Dragomir was turned, he commissioned the necromancer Zulann Flass to craft him a magical cloak that allowed him to travel outside during the daylight hours.</p>
<p>He kept his coffin within a unique bag of holding that he entrusted to his most loyal of knights. Whenever he was slain in battle he merely turned into a gaseous form and need to travel to his resting place to regenerate. By keeping it nearby in the possession of an ally, that distance was greatly reduced.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Dragomir nearly always fought in the front lines of the military campaigns he led.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>While Dragomir's followers were loyal to him for quite some time, they began to see that his voracious desire for power would lead to their doom. Some of his most-trusted devotees commission the creation of the Casque of Imprisonment , a crown of sorts that would stun and immobilize the wearer. They interred Dragomir within a crypt beneath the graveyard of Athkatla , where he remained for years to follow.</p>
<p>Some time during the 12 th century DR , a thief by the name of Hexxat was tasked with recovering the casque for their patron . When she removed it from his head, Dragomir awoke and turned Hexxat into a vampire her self. He then imprisoned her within a nearby stone coffin where she stayed for over two hundred years.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the Hero of Baldur's Gate assisted a woman named Clara with the task of entering into Dragomir's tomb. The pair were both manipulated into slaying Dragomir for good, and freeing Hexxat from her imprisonment.</p>
