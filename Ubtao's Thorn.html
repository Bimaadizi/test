<p>Ubtao's Thorn was a legendary enchanted druidic staff from the jungles of Chult created sometime before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Magics imbued into Ubtao's Thorn were inspired by belief of some members of the Church of Ubtao in the late 15 th century DR, that their deity did not leave Chult. Instead, they believed that Ubtao was poisoned via a thorn plunged into his side by Dendar the Night Serpent, driving the Father of Chult mad. Ubtao's Thorn possessed a powerful +5 enchantment and it improved abilities of the weeding druid as well as the druid's allies'.</p>
