<p>House Melarn was the sixth house of Menzoberranzan by the end of 1484 DR .</p>
<h2>Headquarters</h2>
<p>The House Melarn compound was located in Lolth's Web —webs strung hundreds of feet off the cavern floor—in West Wall in Menzoberranzan . It was constructed after the unification of House Horlbar and House Kenafin with the expertise of drow refugees from Ched Nasad . The webs were lined with faerie fire . The compound took the form of a shell, with a shrine to Lolth in the center, nobles' rooms around that, and other living quarters in the outer rings. The compound was guarded by spiders and driders , as well as drow guards.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>House Melarn was known as one of the Menzoberranyr houses most fanatical to Lolth . Matron Zhindia Melarn believed such fanaticism, including calling out other houses' apparent blasphemy, would bring Lolth's favor upon her. However, most houses resented House Melarn because of their behavior.</p>
<p>The house was strong militarily, but did not hire outsiders such as Bregan D'aerthe for fears concerning their loyalty.</p>
<p>House Melarn, as well as House Barrison Del'Armgo , was using the abandoned House Do'Urden complex as training grounds for its drow soldiers and driders . The troops were kicked out by Bregan D'aerthe under the command of House Baenre .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>House Melarn was formed circa 1383 DR by the merging of House Horlbar and House Kenafin . The First Priestess of House Horlbar, Jhelnae Horlbar , had been discovered to be a secret follower of Eilistraee , and so House Tuin'Tarl had targeted the house for destruction. However, Horlbar's ally, House Kenafin, came to Horlbar's defense and the two houses eventually united. " The name was chosen in honor of Halisstra Melarn , a drow/spider demon servant of Lolth formerly of the Ched Nasadan House Melarn .</p>
<p>At the beginning of 1484 DR , House Melarn was the seventh house of Menzoberranzan. After House Xorlarrin left for Q'Xorlarrin , they become the sixth house.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>Members of House Melarn were known as the "Melarni." In addition to about 340 drow members, a number of driders served the house. The Melarni were known for their religious zeal; even their male wizards were often obsessed with spiders, becoming arachnomancers . Other elite fighters (male and female) trained to protect priestesses with their lives; these were called Dread Fangs of Halisstra .</p>
<p>Most of the drow were Menzoberranyr; however, there were a number of survivors from the original House Melarn who joined the house.</p>
<p>House Melarn had a number of drider and chitine slaves that labored in Lolth's Web.</p>
