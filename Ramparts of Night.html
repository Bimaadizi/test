<p>The Ramparts of Night was a massive abyss in the Earthroot domain of the Underdark .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The abyss did not reach the surface, but it plummeted an immense distance before connecting to the Shadowfell . That is, it was effectively bottomless; falling into the abyss would lead to a great canyon on the Shadowfell.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The abyss was located underneath the Sunrise Mountains , the mountain range forming the eastern border of Thay .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Spellplague , the borders of the Ramparts expanded to encompass a far greater region, reaching an area underneath the Copper Mountains of Murgh√¥m .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The walls of the Ramparts of Night were inhabited by cloakers and other creatures of shadow, including shadar-kai from Netheril . A large enclave of gulgars also made their home in the walls, and tribes of gulgars living on the surface in the Sunrise Mountains were descended from there.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>The shadar-kai settlement of Ikemmu was located on the southern edge of the Ramparts.</p>
