<h2>History</h2>
<p>Orgnir's career as a giant adventurer came to an end when he got lost in the Sword Mountains sometime before the late 15 th century DR. Wandering the mountain slopes, he came across the Dragonbone Vale. Exhausted, Orgnir collapsed near the ruin where the Scaleblight Mythallar was buried under. As the giant was sleeping, the mythallar 's corruption seeped into his body, stealing the adventurer's life and twisting his now undead form into a guardian bound to the artifact . With years, Orgnir the Lost became a guardian of the lands, guiding the dead dragons to their graves in the valley.</p>
