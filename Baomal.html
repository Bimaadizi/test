<p>Baomal was the capital city of Hmurrath , a merfolk empire on the Hmur Plateau beneath the Sea of Fallen Stars .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Baomal fell to ruin after the fall of the Hmurrath empire in 820 TS (750 DR) . Over the years various scavengers and engineers from farms or villages in the surrounding area would pick away at the city's coral and stone structures, seeking to repurpose the materials for their own settlements. By 1440 TS (1370 DR) , very little of the once proud capital remained as a result of this practice.</p>
