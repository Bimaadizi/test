<p>Volo's Guide to All Things Magical was a pamphlet written by Volothamp Geddarm and published by Tym Waterdeep Limited early in 1358 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Printed on vellum, the guide was full of long-forgotten spells and a grab-bag full of odds and ends about magic .</p>
<h2>Controversy</h2>
<p>Several powerful mages, including Elminster , would have preferred the spells and secrets in the guide to remain unknown to the general public. All copies were hunted down and destroyed.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The initial pamphlet, "Volo's Guide to All Things Magical", was first published early in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR . Notoriously, it included a great many spells that had been thought long forgotten and exposed these to folk across Faer√ªn . Several mighty mages, who would rather these spells had stayed forgotten, confronted Volo over this. In response, Volo switched his focus from writing books of magic to writing travelogues. Nevertheless, the spells remained known to the magical community, and even entered common use.</p>
<h3>Re-Release</h3>
<p>In the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , a second pamphlet of the same name was released. This version, now named Volo's Guide to all Things Magical, the Revised, Authorized & Expanded Edition , was extensively rewritten and edited by Elminster. A copy of the original publication and Elminster's authorized edition were in the holdings of the library at Candlekeep .</p>
