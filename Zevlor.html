<p>Commander Zevlor was a member of the Hellriders of Elturel that came to lead a group of fellow tiefling refugees across the Sword Coast during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Zevlor had mid-long black hair, some of which was tied up at the back. He had two large horns and bright yellow eyes, and fought with a pair of swords .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Even after leaving Elturel, Zevlor held onto the enchanted gauntlets he wore, a pair known as Hellrider's Pride .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before the Descent of Elturel the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Zevlor was a proud member of the Hellriders of Elturgard . When the city returned to the Prime from Avernus in the Nine Hells , newfound bigotry against tieflings led to them being expelled from their home.</p>
<p>Zevlor arose as a leader of the group and led them west along the Risen Road towards Baldur's Gate . Eventually they were given shelter at the Emerald Grove , by the grace of Archdruid Halsin . Zevlor was presented with a challenge; he had to keep the peace with some of Halsin's druids, who did not approve of his group's presence, while simultaneously getting his people ready for a long trek to Baldur's Gate.</p>
<p>Some time later, the adventurer Aradin and two of his companions, having earlier left the Grove on an expedition with Halsin, fled from a pack of goblins led by Za'krug towards the grove's main gates. After expressing his disapproval about the group's leading goblins to the Grove and the seeming loss of Halsin, Zevlor tried to let them in but was stopped by the goblins' arrival and the tiefling Kanon being shot dead by one of their archers. A band of arriving adventurers may have joined the defense.</p>
