<p>Oblar Minstrelwish was a halfling adventurer of some notoriety from Secomber . On his travels, he met Mrune Moontan , a half-elf sorceress with many talents, including brewing the best ale that Oblar had ever tasted. They eventually married and started the Moon Mountain Brewery on the Unicorn Run north of Secomber. As of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , his descendants were still operating the brewery, along with another family of halflings, the Borulglar , to whom they were related by blood and marriage.</p>
