<p>Historically, the Three Free Cities were more trade adversaries than allies. The Year of Secret Slaughters, 326 DR brought a bloody conflict to the Shining Plains and the grazing pastures of the famed Plainsteeds . Ormath and Lheshayl turned disputes into an armed conflict. Two armies, totaling 25,000, spilled blood for over two weeks onto the land plot, which would later be known as the Field of Tears . Eventually, warriors of the wemic Ten-Paw tribe joined the fray, driving the human armies away. Following the conflict, the Three Free Cities and the Ten-Paw gathered on the Hill of Memories annually to commiserate the bloodshed and make sure such conflicts never occurred again.</p>
