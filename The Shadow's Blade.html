<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Shadow's Blade was a weapon specifically designed to be used by assassins and was in high demand among those who used blades to settle differences. Many of the sword's owners did not keep it for very long. In the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , The Shadow's Blade , the original or a replica, was wielded by Purvis , an assassin who was hired by the speaker of Lonelywood .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , the weapon belonged to the assassin named Slythe who served the infamous Bhaalspawn Sarevok Anchev in the city of Baldur's Gate . The following year, one such blade belonged to Renal Bloodscalp of the Shadow Thieves of Athkatla in Amn . The sword was offered as a reward to the guild's allies who would help Renal uncover fellow thief Mae'Var 's treason. Soon after, the sword fell into the hands of another Bhaalspawn—the thief Viekang in the town of Saradush .</p>
