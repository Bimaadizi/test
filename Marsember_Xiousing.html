<h2>History</h2>
<p>Xiousing was built on land exposed after the level of the Sea of Fallen Stars dropped in the years following the Spellplague . The original Shou squatters on the new land were ruled by Burgher Xarod.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Empty Necropolis, 1419 DR , a Shou noble named Duc-Sum Li and his son were traveling through Cormyr. Crown Prince Foril I was very ill and no Cormyrean healers could heal him. King Azoun Obarskyr V summoned Duc-Sum to court and the Shou was able to heal the prince. In gratitude, King Azoun knighted Duc-Sum and granted him control over a small parcel of land in Marsember inhabited by Shou squatters. The notable roads are: North Bridge Street, South Bridge Street and Commerce Way.</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Xiousing was a bustling community inhabited mostly by Shou. Unfortunately the district flooded during the events of the Second Sundering , and remained so after the Great Rain .</p>
