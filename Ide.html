<p>Ide was a tiefling child from Elturel that was kicked out from the city along with others of his kind in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the Descent briefly dragged Elturel down to the Nine Hells in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the city's tiefling population was promptly blamed and exiled from the city. The community traveled west from the city towards Baldur's Gate, but was forced to stop for a time at the Emerald Grove due to increased goblin attacks along the Risen Road .</p>
<p>Under the supervision of the stalwart Asharak , tiefling children like Ide were given training with small blades so that they could defend themselves against goblins if the need ever arose. While some other children were more hesitant, Ide was confident in his ability to face down a goblinoid attack.</p>
