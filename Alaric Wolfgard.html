<p>Alaric Wolfgard was a monster hunter from the Reghedman Tribe of the Elk , who settled in the town of Targos in Icewind Dale in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Alaric was an intimidating human man of quite the size. He had a light skin tone and a bristly red beard. He spoke in a put-on brash manner but his eyes betrayed his emotional softness.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Even though Alaric was born into the proud and traditionalist Reghedmen Tribe of the Elk, he did not feel like he fit in and, when the opportunity arose, thanks to the Tribe's relationship with the Ten-Towns , the barbarian adopted a settled life in town. Eventually, though, he used his knowledge and barbarian strength to become an accomplished monster hunter in Icewind Dale. He knew how to fight and defeat various beasts, monstrosities, and savage humanoids of the Dale.</p>
<p>In Mirtul of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , as the Ten Towns were facing a looming threat from an ancient and buried evil, Alaric Wolfgard frequented the Wolf's Pelt Inn in Targos . It was then he may have met the famed Hero of Neverwinter , offering them advice on dealing with the many dangers of Icewind Dale as well as the Reghed Glacier . When the mysterious shaman Iceblood led an army of the demigod Arctus against the town of Targos, Alaric offered monster-slaying supplies to aid the town's defenders.</p>
<p>When the crisis was over, Alaric planned on traveling south, past the Spine of the World , away from Icewind Dale.</p>
