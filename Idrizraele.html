<p>Idrizraele was a Morueme blue dragon that lived in the Morueme lair within the Nether Mountains until the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1371 DR the patriarch of the Morueme dragon clan. Kizilpazar , was killed by his power-hungry sons, Nahaunglaroth and Roraurim . As Idrizraele was the elder dragon's younger mate, she was driven out of the clan's ancestral home by the two younger males. Whether out of frustration, despair, or rage, Idrizraele assaulted the nearby Lady's Hand Monastery and was blasted away by the clergy of Loviatar , via weapons from ancient Netheril .</p>
<p>Oddly enough, her death was avenged by Nahaunglaroth and Roraurim, who proceeded to destroy over half of temple's Loviatan inhabitants.</p>
