<h2>History</h2>
<p>Elden was, before the Spellplague a War Wizard of Cormyr . However, to augment his psychic powers he entered into a pact with Asmodeus and when his superior discovered this they attacked Elden. In the battle, Karis , the Rashemi witch wife of Elden, lost her mind, so Elden started planning how cure her.</p>

In 1479 DR , Elden arrived in Neverwinter with Karis but his wife suffered a collapse and, thanks to Mordai Vell , Elden took her to Helm's Hold . However, Mordai used the situation to control the wizard. Elden started having his minions kidnap people in order to conduct experiments on them to one day cure Karis. However, the experiments produced only a number of blabbering idiots. Elden also tried to frame Mordai's Ashmadai for the kidnappings. However Mordai's Ashmadai identified him and sent a team led by a devil to kill him. Elden survived only thanks to an adventuring party that was investigating the kidnappers.</p>
<p>At last, he found a possible cure for Karis and invaded Helm's Hold with his mind-thrall minions, including Chartilifax , to retake her. He performed a ritual on top of Helm 's Cathedral in order to cure Karis by absorbing the storm into her. He was defeated by the adventurers however.</p>
