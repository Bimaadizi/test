<p>The Tower of the Order was the headquarters and seat of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors in Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Tower was situated in the Castle Ward on the Street of Bells , near the middle of the block between Selduth Street and Buckle Alley .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Stretching four stories tall, the Tower of the Order was fashioned from stone and surrounded by a magical fence of green-sparkling lights that coalesced into the symbols of Mystra and Azuth . A mosaic of the hand of Azuth above the Tower's ingress was said to guard the tower, ready to fire spells at any would-be intruders. As of the 1360s DR, it was considered the most spectacular guildhall in the Castle Ward.</p>
<p>The Tower's cellars were heavily guarded by golems and magical traps.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Watchful Order provided spellcasting for a fee, and could also be hired to stand guard over buildings to prevent and extinguish fires. Members of the Order could purchase spell components and magic items from the Tower's cellars.</p>
