<h2>History</h2>
<p>While she was alive, Erika lived with Gunter Weiss, an old wizard who slowly grew more obsessed with getting her to love him. However, she became disturbed by the knowledge of his experiments with eternal life and necromancy , until, when he finally made his attempt at gaining eternal life, she disturbed it, ruining the spell. According to Weiss's notes, she acquired a book from a cleric prior to that point. After disturbing the ritual, she died trapped in the house at a later date.</p>
<p>In the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , adventurers may have arrived at Harrow Hill and discovered the silver heart that Erika stole, in plain sight in the library. They may also have discovered her picture in her bedroom; if disturbed, it animated and spoke, revealing that the silver heart was something she knew was important to Gunter's plans. Fastened to the back of her portrait, there was a brass key, leading to the secret crypt where Gunter Weiss's ritual took place.</p>
