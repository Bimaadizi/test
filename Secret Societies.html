<h2>Content</h2>
<p>One chapter in the book talked about the relatively recently formed organization called the Kraken Society or Heralds of the Sea, with a many-tentacled purple squid being their symbol. It was said to had been birthed in the ruins of Ascale out of several groups of criminals, spies, thieves, and priests of Umberlee from north Faerûn . All of them served a single overlord of whom little was known. This secret society was prone to assassinate, torture, and kidnap its enemies.</p>
