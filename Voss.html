<h2>History</h2>
<p>Voss was widely believed to have killed Orpheus at the end of the War of the Comet . In truth, Orpheus survived, albeit imprisoned within the Astral Prism . After the war, Voss maintained a façade of loyalty to Vlaakith , but secretly sought to free Orpheus and end Vlaakith's reign.</p>
<p>In the Faerûn Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Voss and his fellow knights began pursuit of an illithid nautiloid , in search of the prism. Mounted atop their red dragon steeds, the knights traveled to the planet of Toril over the city of Yartar , to the Nine Hells on the planes of Cania and Avernus , and again back to Toril in the region of the Sword Coast .</p>
<p>Just beyond their crèche , Voss and his knights began to patrol a stretch of the Risen Road . There they encountered a group of Flaming Fist mercenaries, who they then killed without a second thought.</p>
