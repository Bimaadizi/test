<p>Palien was a warrior and a hero, who was celebrated for fending off several groups of monsters during the founding of Thundertree .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Palien of Neverwinter set out to Thundertree to strike back at the monsters who attacked those in the area. The warrior fought many approaching monsters valiantly in Neverwinter Wood , with spear and shield , to the relief of the locals. In the honor of Palien, they erected a 10 ft (3 m) wooden statue of the hero in the center of Thundertree's town square.</p>
<p>Several years later, circa 1491 DR , the statue was still standing, despite the eruption of Mount Hotenow . It was, however, quite weathered and lent to one side.</p>
