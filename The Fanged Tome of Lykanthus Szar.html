<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of 1374 DR , it was among the treasures kept within Blackstaff Tower in Waterdeep , somewhere between the second floor and the ground floor. It was one that Tsarra Chaadren remembered passing often while studying there.</p>
<p>In the late 1490s DR , the corpse of the Uthgardt Elk tribe warrior Ven Salafin , slain at the Battle of the Evermoors circa 1400 DR and briefly revived via speak with dead , was asked by Edgin Darvis what his favorite book was. He was indecisive, but for what he considered historical works he answered with The Fanged Tome of Lykanthus Szar or Galadaster's Orizon .</p>
