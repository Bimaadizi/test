<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Home to a number of monstrous humanoid and goblinoid races, the former dale was almost completely overrun with goblins , orcs and ogres .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h3>Settlements</h3>
<p>Although no longer part of the Dalelands , the cities of Teshwave and Snowmantle remained under control of Zhentil Keep until their destruction.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1316 DR it was invaded by Zhent forces and orcs working for them. The people were slain, enslaved or driven away, and thousands of refugees sought refuge in the surrounding dales.</p>
<p>The valley was quarried and the granite used to build vast sections of the walls that protected Zhentil Keep. . They continued to strip the land of its resources for over 50 years.</p>
<p>During the late mid 1300's DR, a bandit known as Tyran the Outlaw struck back against the Zhent forces. Though he had few forces to muster, his efforts had earned himself a 500 gp bounty.</p>
