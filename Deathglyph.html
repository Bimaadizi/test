<p>A deathglyph was perhaps the most powerful handglyph weapon used by the Geomancers of Kadar , capable of instantly killing an enemy.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Deathglyphs were special medallions enchanted to hold the power word, kill spell . The wielder simply needed to face the medallion toward an enemy and utter the command word to unleash the lethal power of the spell. The magic of the deathglyph would slay those caught within a 10‑foot-wide (3‑meter) sphere.</p>
<p>These handglyphs could not be recharged.</p>
