<p>Dynloch Pass was a pass through the Synnorian Mountains in central Gwynneth in the Moonshae Isles , connecting Myrloch Vale to the main body of Corwell . It exited the mountains on the south side near Freeman's Down . It was close to, and might join into, Synnoria .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It lay very high in the mountains, and its approaches were winding and hidden, making it little-known to all but the local druids, dwarves , and Llewyrr elves .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The pass and the lands around were once tended by the druid Gwendolynn , but she was killed in the Year of the Saddle, 1345 DR by Trahern while he was laying a trail for the invading Northmen .</p>
<p>The pass was subsequently used by Grunnarch the Red , the Bloodriders , and accompanying Northmen and firbolg armies in an attempt to split Corwell in two and intercept refugees fleeing from eastern villages. It took them two days to traverse the pass.</p>
