<p>The Temple of Shar in Bezantur , Thay was a place of worship dedicated to Shar .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple was located in south-central Bezantur, the so-called "City of a Thousand Temples." Appropriately, it was surrounded by other temples, namely the Temple of Umberlee to the south, the Temple of Auril to the east, and the Temple of Helm to the north.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The temple was a long building with an amphitheater at its southern end. It was built of dark-colored stone.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Evil rites and dark magic rituals were performed in the amphitheater.</p>
<p>Services at the temple were popular among the citizens of Bezantur. They were conducted by priestesses in black hooded robes , and were often attended by Red Wizards and even evil clerics of other deities . Thayans turned to Shar for reassurance whenever a loved one died.</p>
<p>The temple also served as a base from which to launch attacks on followers of Shar's hated rival, Sel√ªne , and to coordinate the Sharran church 's meddling in affairs far beyond the City of a Thousand Temples.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Thayan Church of Shar was considered subordinate to the Thayan Church of Myrkul in the 14 th century DR prior to the Time of Troubles . As a consequence, the Sharran high priestess of the time reported to the high priest of Myrkul . Additionally, most shrines to Shar were located within temples to Myrkul, with the temple in Bezantur being one of only three that were dedicated only to Shar (the other two being located in Eltabbar and Pyarados , with one other semi-independent shrine located in Surthay ). Following the Time of Troubles, the Temple of Shar in Bezantur aligned itself first with Cyric and then increasingly with Iyachtu Xvim .</p>
<p>By the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, worship of Shar was popular in Bezantur and throughout Thay.</p>
