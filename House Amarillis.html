<p>House Amarillis was a moon elf house descended from Kethryllia Amarillis , whose body was interred in the Hall of the Ancients in Leuthilspar . The house had no leader and its members tended not to specialise in any particular vocation. The house was known for its members' tendency to leave Evermeet to explore Faer√ªn . The house's estate in Leuthilspar consisted of an exotic walled castle.</p>
