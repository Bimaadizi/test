<p>The Dark Door was a very well-furnished, albeit particularly expensive, inn located in the dwarven village of Glen within Mistledale in the midâ€“14 th century DR . It was noteworthy in for being made entirely of stone and, of course, being extremely welcoming to dwarves .</p>
<p>The cryptic name of the inn referenced the "deep mine", an entrance to the Underdark also found within the village. This entrance was shrouded in secrecy and unknown to the larger community of Mistrans throughout the dale, until some time around 1370 DR .</p>
