<p>Durissa, like her sister Morissa Thornion , was daughter of the town of Timindar 's resident mage but being more interested in the arts of deception she decided to become an illusionist. In time her deceptions became more and more dangerous until in 1349 DR Durissa killed someone and was exiled from Timindar as a result.</p>
<p>In 1358 DR, Durissa became one of the agents of the arcanaloth Yrkhetep in exchange for having her revenge against Timindar's citizens. She went back to the city and convinced her sister to hide her. Later, posing as Morissa, Durissa spread rumors in order to lure the Gray Doom and the Sailors of the Crimson Sea mercenary companies into a trap at Thurgabanteth . As a contingency plan, if the Sailors of the Crimson Sea arrived in the city Durissa's agent would kill Lord Reland Tymin and Durissa would pose as him using her illusions .</p>
