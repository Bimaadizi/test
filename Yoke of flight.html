<p>A yoke of flight was a magical yoke that enabled its user to harness a pair of horses to a chariot and gain the ability to fly.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Using the yoke, a rider could command the horses and chariot to fly at a maximum speed of twelve miles (nineteen kilometers) per hour.</p>
<h2>Restrictions</h2>
<p>Aerial maneuverability granted by the yoke was rather poor. In order to take off from the ground, the horses had to gallop with sufficient speed in a straight line. Landing likewise required a straight ground path with enough length to slow down safely. Furthermore, a reasonable airspeed had to be maintained, otherwise the chariot would crash.</p>
