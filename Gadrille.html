<p>Gadrille the Reef-Reaver was a lieutenant of the Cult of Talos in the late 15 th century DR . She was in charge of the cult's operations in the Thunder Cliff Caves .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Gadrille was a despotic and immensely committed servant of Talos .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Gadrille was an experienced wizard specializing in the school of evocation magic.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Gadrille had a fiendish pet named " Tooth-N-Claw " that was fiercely protective of her.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Gadrille and her subordinates enticed unwary ships near to the caverns and destroyed them on the magical reefs. They kidnapped the crew, either sacrificing them to Talos or selling them as slaves. The debris was dragged into the caves and anything of value was salvaged and sold. The cult of Talos used the wealth gained from this heinous endeavor to finance agents along the Sword Coast and the High Road who tried to build shrines that would ultimately give the cult control of the region.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Gadrille was loyal to the cult's leader, Fheralai Stormsworn . Although Fheralai recognized Gadrille's unpredictability, her unwavering commitment to the cult of Talos made her a formidable and feared lieutenant. To keep her zeal in check, Fheralai appointed Sovendahl Erkinze as Gadrille's deputy to help her and keep a watch on her unstable tendencies.</p>
<p>Gadrille treated the cultists who worked under her with severity and cruelty. When she suspected a cultist of not being pious enough, the cultist would be hauled into the cave's so-called blowhole to be judged by Talos. Unbeknownst to her, the blowhole was actually a magical portal that activated randomly, transporting a creature to a distant location.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1491 DR , Gadrille's second-in-command, Sovendahl Erkinze, disapproved of some of her more reckless actions and secretly met with the cult's leader, Fheralai Stormsworn, urging her to put a stop to it. Gadrille complied with Fheralai's request but prayed to Talos to punish Sovendahl. The god answered her prayers and cursed Sovendahl.</p>
<p>A little later, the Thunder Cliff Caves were attacked from sea by a group of adventurers . They defeated Gadrille and her Talos cultists, putting an end to her operation.</p>
