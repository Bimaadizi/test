<p>The Silvermoon Playhouse was a theater in the city of Ravens Bluff that had been constructed around either 1370 or 1371 DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>This elegant building was directly connected to Darksilver House , the grand mansion of the swashbuckling adventurer Lorien Darkarrow , who had financed the building's construction and continued to act as its financier. Situated on the exterior was a ticket office, where customers paid for seating. And the antechamber's roof was a clear crystal, providing a view of the moon at night.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The interior of the playhouse was gilded with golden trim and polished silver . Its ante-chamber was notably a large bar, measuring 60 feet (18 meters) in length. The building's backdoor lead into Lorien's home.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Silvermoon Playhouse was owned and operated by a theater troupe of Selûnite adventurers, who typically put on very tasteful plays of marked quality. The playhouse was closed during the day, as its plays usually began at moonrise or two hours before sunrise. Plays usually began and end with a small, non-overbearing selection of scenes that constituted worship of Selûne , acting as the troupe's gift to their goddess. It was also not uncommon for many in the audience to be encouraged to sing along to its musical numbers.</p>
<p>The price of tickets varied depending upon seating, but were kept relatively cheap, owing to the ownership situation and the playhouse's financier. Seats in the upper balcony cost 5 gold pieces , seats on the main level cost 10 gp, and a ticket for seats close to the orchestra cost 25 gp.</p>
<p>Whenever a show wasn't being hosted, the playhouse often opened its private bar to the public. The varied menu of the bar included The Moon's Head Brace for 15 gp, Silverymoon Ale for 10 gp, The Silver Moonbeam for 50 gp, and The Walking Furniture 20 gp.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The playhouse rarely suffered from thievery, as it was protected by an array of guards and wards and Mordenkainen's faithful hound , both spells that had been put up by Lorien Darkarrow. Additionally, being that it was owned by Lorien Darkarrow, who was both a landowner and knight of Ravens Bluff, the City Guard took care to apprehend anyone attempting to break into the Silvermoon.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>While a majority of performers at the Silvermoon were part of the playhouse's theater troupe, many of its other bards were visiting friends of Lorien who acted for free, performing simply for the love of the theater. There were initially tensions over this, but once the troupe understood their livelihoods weren't at risk they began to have more fun with the proceedings.</p>
<p>The leader of the Silvermoon's theater troupe was the half-elf bard Yvandolyn . Doris , a half-elven werebear specialty priest of Selûne, operated the ticket office and guarded the main entrance during the day until noon, when the playhouse's large cleaning staff clocked in. And its bar was managed by Michael and Stanley , who were Selûnite laymen that took pride in being able to work at Silvermoon.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Within its first six tendays of operation, the Silvermoon Playhouse had performed four distinct plays. Its third performance went down rather poorly, so much so that the audience were vacating the playhouse and a halfling backrow shouted a demand for a refund. The staff obliged this request and began returning the coins of theatergoers. However, a visiting bardic master friends of Lorien by the name of Morgan gathered together a number of singers to the stage and told the audience to forget what they had been watching before, proclaiming that a brand new play was going to be performed that evening. After a half-bell intermission, this new play was performed and it won over the affection of the theatergoers. Such fervor was generated over this new play that for the next thirty days tickets for it were sold out.</p>
<p>On their sixth week of operation, the Silvermoon Playhouse began advertising its newest show, which involved pirates, shipwrecks and a dragon turtle . Tickets for the show's premiere were sold at five times their normal value.</p>
