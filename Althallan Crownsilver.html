<p>Althallan Crownsilver was a member of House Crownsilver , a noble family in Cormyr . He ascended to the head of the family for a short time in the early 13 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Althallan was of small stature, but moved with feline grace. He had luxurious red hair and large dark-blue or indigo eyes that made him appear almost feminine.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>His wit was as quick and sharp as his swords.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Despite being a small man, Althallan had a great capacity for alcohol and could drink much larger men under the table. He was quite good at wielding two rapier -like longswords simultaneously. He had no qualms about using a large drinking vessel as a missile weapon.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>According to the notorious divulger of secrets, Volothamp Geddarm , Althallan and his friend Donder Cormaeril concocted a scheme to put pressure on western Sembian merchants and holdings by secretly supporting the so-called Hullack Hawk —a bandit that attacked Sembian interests and fled into the Hullack Forest —and publicly directing the blame toward Eltrym Drauthglas , the Lord of Hullack.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Althallan once foiled an assassination attempt that happened after a bout of drinking. All the other nobles involved were intoxicated to the point of impairment, but Althallan had the wherewithal to intercept and slay the killer.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Although unproven, Volo posited that the Hullack Hawk was none other than Beldarm Truesilver in disguise, doing the bidding of, or at least in league with, Althallan and Donder.</p>
