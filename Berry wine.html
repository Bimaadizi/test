<p>The elves of Tall Trees in the High Forest made a highly-alcoholic and very sweet berry wine. In the town of Targris in the Land of the Lions , berry wine was notably salty sweet. Among the warehouse workers of Suzail , weak but sweet berry wine was a popular libation. Montalar's Happy House in Suzail served its berry wine to wash down spicy brown sauce from the local specialty handfood â€“ happy helms .</p>
