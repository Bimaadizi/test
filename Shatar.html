<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Shatar was one of the many small, unimportant, nondescript fishing villages around the edge of Lake Weng , with a population of 200 or fewer. Its only notable feature was its remarkably well-made carved stone docks.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Shatar was on the eastern shore of Lake Weng below the Cloud Peaks , near the other villages of Ideepton , Edive , and Minsor Vale , and was the closest settlement to Amnwater . It lay close to the Wengwater as it flowed out of the mountains, at an altitude of 1,500 feet (460 meters), and was one of the closest settlements to the remote mountain fortresses of Citadel Amnur and Citadel Rashturl .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The folk of Shatar supported themselves with lake fishing and the farming of root vegetables, with the surplus sold on to travelers and nearby military sites such as Citadel Amnur and Citadel Rashturl.</p>
