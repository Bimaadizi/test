<p>Elder Reader Salyndra Shaern was a half-elf cleric of Oghma and of Corellon Larethian based at the House of Knowledge in Neverwinter in the late mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The House of Knowledge was already being run by Chief Priest Watger Brighthair but, due to his youth, Salyndra was installed by the Church of Oghma to guide him. They continued to lead the temple together through the 1360s DR to at least 1370 DR.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The two priests offered education for free, with teaching sessions doubling as services to Oghma the Binder.</p>
<p>As well as guiding Watger, Salyndra's role was also to promote good relations between humans and elves in Neverwinter and to study human wisdom for the elves. In all three areas, she did well.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A petite old woman, Salyndra had hair that was gray, long, and untidy and spoke in a dry tone. She wore plain dark robes .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Although Salyndra had a cynical attitude and her advice was sharply incisive, at her core she was genuinely kind and a fast and loyal friend to travelers in need. Adventurers she'd aided often returned to the House of Knowledge to update her on their triumphs and to pay her back via donations to the temple.</p>
