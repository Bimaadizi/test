<p>Ecatzin was a couatl follower of Ubtao in Chult and Katashaka in the early 3 rd millennium before Dale Reckoning .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around −3000 DR , the couatls of Chult were dwindling in number and desired to halt the spread of the yuan-ti into the western end of the Chultan Peninsula . Searching for another people to take their place, the winged serpents eventually chose the humans of Katashaka, and went to them to preach of their god, Ubtao .</p>
<p>Ecatzin came to the Tabaxi tribe and spoke of Ubtao. Although initially resistant, fearing the feathered serpent to be a minion of the perfidious Akongo , some of the tribe gradually came to accept the couatl's words. Ecatzin taught them a little of its language, and even instructed a chosen few like Oyai in a forbidden magic called matumbe .</p>
<p>After Oyai used matumbe to seal the Sleeper who tyrannized the Tabaxi, Ecatzin named the liberated Tabaxi as Ubtao's blessed children. Soon after, in −2809 DR , Ecatzin and Oyai led the peoples of the Tabaxi, Eshowe , Thinguth , and several others who'd accepted the faith of Ubtao to go with the couatls in a great pilgrimage over the ocean in some 300 canoa (canoes). Landing on the Wild Coast, they journeyed into the Jungles of Chult and met their new god at the Peaks of Flame .</p>
