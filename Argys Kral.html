<p>Argys Kral was an inhabitant of the town of Ghars in Cormyr in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Argys went to Aunsible Durn's smithy , Dovo —a friend of Argys who'd worked there and fancied himself a prankster—put a burr under his mare 's saddle so it threw him when he mounted. Aunsible Durn chewed Dovo out for that. Argys was likely even less impressed.</p>
