Some years before the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the lich was destroyed, likely by others of his kin. In 1369 DR, a ranger companion of Mazzy Fentan named Patrick wielded the Duskblade against the Shade Lord and his pet dragon Thaxll'ssillyia , who infested an ancient ruined temple dedicated to Amaunator with darkness. Patrick perished in the struggle, and his undead form, now a shade , wielded the Duskblade against anyone who dared to enter the temple.</p>
