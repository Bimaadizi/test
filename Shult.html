<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Activities</h2>

This was thanks to his arrangements with Mitchifer of the dimensionally neighboring World Serpent Inn . Shult would deliver it for free, but the patron must pay whatever Shult's vendors charged. Shult also knew how to enter the World Serpent and would sell the secret to those who asked.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He had three daughters, whom Volo described as jolly, robust, and incredibly energetic about their duties.</p>
