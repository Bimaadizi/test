<p>The Ghost Stag was an elusive white stag that lived near Stag Steads in the King's Forest of Cormyr . Some hunters returned to the Stead year after year in hopes of catching it, for it was said to vanish, fading into nothingness, when cornered. Senior War Wizards who frequented the Stead said that the Ghost Stag was a living beast, not an undead , but possessed of a natural teleportation ability and perhaps other psionics that allowed it to escape spells.</p>
