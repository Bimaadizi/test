<p>The House of the Black Lord was a temple of Bane in Mulmaster that came to be the center of worship of the Black Lord throughout the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple was located on the east side of the city, not far off from the Zhents' Quarter .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As of the late 1470s, the temple became a source of political strife between different factions that had formed within the ruling Council of Blades . While the councilors that shared in Bane's worship created a powerful sect within the city, they were directly opposed by other belligerent members of the Blades, or those who shared a different faith altogether.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The temple was formed some time after the rise of Iyachtu Xvim 's faith in the Moonsea region, following the death of Bane at the hands of Cyric during the Time of Troubles in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR . While it was originally dedicated to the worship of the Godson, it had switched over to the worship of Bane by the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR .</p>
