<p>Ufarskaddun was the leader of a band of 200 orogs that migrated from the Lowerdark to the Northdark during the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1372 DR , Ufarskaddun led his people upwards from the depths of Toril , searching for a base from which they could strike out at the surface lands of Faer√ªn . During their journey, they came across the ruins of the dwarven city of Splendarrmornn , the royal capital of ancient Ammarindar . They took over the ravaged dwarfhold, ridding the region of the undead and scattered fiends .</p>
<p>Some of their patrols came across tanarukks , demonic orcs, that unbeknownst to the orog chieftain, were part of the much larger Scoured Legion of Hellgate Keep . While he ordered the complete extinction of any remainders of the foul hybrids, he was unaware of the true strength of their stronghold .</p>
