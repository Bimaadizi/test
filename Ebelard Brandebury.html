<p>Ebelard Brandebury was the duke of the Duchy of Brandiar in the Kingdom of Damara during the the Vaasan War of the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Ebelard was a member of the noble House Brandebury , the hereditary dukes of Brandiar. He was also the last member of his House to hold the title of Duke.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Zhengyi , the Witch-King of Vaasa , invaded Damara in the Year of the Bright Blade, 1347 DR , a decade-long war ensued, much of which was fought within the borders of the Duchy of Brandiar. Eventually, Duke Ebelard was forced to concede defeat to the evil Vaasan forces, making Brandiar the first Damaran province to fall to the Witch-King's conquest. As Zhengyi ascended to power over Damara in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Ebelard passed away, supposedly of a "broken heart" after seeing the depredations that his surrender had enabled.</p>
<p>Rather than appoint a successor within his new vassal state of Brandiar, Zhengyi instead had the entirety of House Brandebury exterminated, and left the duchy with no ruler. The people would eventually coalesce around a common farmer named Dormythyrr , who quickly became Steward of the vacant ducal throne before becoming the clear successor to Ebelard's title in the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR .</p>
