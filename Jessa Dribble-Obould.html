<p>Jessa Dribble-Obould was an orc priestess of the Kingdom of Many-Arrows in the North in the early 15 th century DR . She was a companion of Bruenor Battlehammer and Drizzt Do'Urden during the search for Gauntlgrym , the lost kingdom of dwarves .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jessa was one of the ambassadors of the Kingdom of Many-Arrows to Mithral Hall . In the Year of True Omens, 1409 DR , she helped Nanfoodle Buswilligan poison Bruenor, but this was only so that he could fake his own death in order to secretly abdicate the throne of Mithral Hall and make Banak Brawnanvil the eleventh king.</p>
<p>Thibbledorf Pwent , distraught over the apparent death of Bruenor, later sought out Nanfoodle and Jessa for answers in the hills outside of Mithral Hall. Upon finding the traitorous pair, he attacked them to get answers. During the fight, however, Drizzt and a very-much-alive Bruenor arrived to stop him.</p>
<p>After that, Jessa, Drizzt, Bruenor, Pwent, and Nanfoodle, set out to find Gauntlgrym and they traveled together for many years.</p>
