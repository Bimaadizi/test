<p>A weredog was a lycanthrope that could transform into a large dog . They were often confused with werewolves .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Weredogs were able to transform into dogs such as mastiffs or St. Bernards as opposed to actual wolves . Despite this, the similarities between dogs and wolves were similar enough that they could be mistaken for normal werewolves.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Most often, weredogs were good -willed. They chose werewolves as their enemies, and swore to defeat them, despite being less numerous and powerful.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Weredogs attacked their foes with a powerful bite, which also transmitted lycanthropy.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Weredogs were originally humanoids suffering from the lycanthropic curse, but whose strong, good-aligned personalities were able to fight back against the infection. The result was an altered form of lycanthropy that allowed the victim's personality to remain.</p>
