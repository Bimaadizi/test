<p>Cloaks were several side dishes served at the Owlroost Head Inn by themselves or as a main entr√©e. To create the first type of cloaks, one needed to cook, chop, and mash potatos , then shape them and fry until crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, all while flavoring them with lemon , flower buds, and rosemary . Another option were squid -stuffed yams . The squid was boiled in lime juice and the plate was then decorated with lemon spices and crushed mint . Lastly, a portion of fried bones salad was considered to be one of the inn's cloaks.</p>
