<p>The Shadow Fringe , also called simply the Fringe , referred to the intersection of the Prime Material Plane and the Plane of Shadow .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In locations located in the Shadow Fringe, tendrils of shadowstuff "ebbed and flowed" like tides. From time to time, dangerous creatures wandered over from the Plane of Shadow to the Fringe. Sections of cities on the Fringe sometimes disappeared spontaneously into the Plane of Shadow, not to reappear for many years. The Shadow Fringe had no warmth of color and everything was less tangible.</p>
<p>Within the Shadow Fringe's equivalent of day-and-night cycle, the daytime hours received some illumination from a band of light set over the horizon that shone as bright as the sun did over deserts of Faerûn . Small beams of radiance shone around shapes and figures within the Fringe. The nighttime hours within the Fringe were referred to as the Shifting. During this time, the shadows of the Fringe in effect "became motion", losing all form and spawning bizarre creatures.</p>
<p>The Shadow Fringe could be accessed by individuals with the right items or abilities and used to travel long distances in a shorter amount of time. Nimor Imphraezl , for example, had a ring of shadows that allowed him to shadow walk between Menzoberranzan and Gracklstugh in just a few hours, although the distance was more than 100 mi (160 km). The Shadovar Shadow adept was capable of transporting himself and others through the Fringe by means of his access to the Shadow Weave .</p>
