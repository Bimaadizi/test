<p>Habrauk Al-Nirin was a man from the Al-Alisk clan. He kidnapped Princess Sithal Al-Husn and froze her in a magical box to preserve her beauty. The archmage Martek used his clan's crypt as a test for adventurers seeking his crystal minaret.</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>As of 1356 DR , Habrauk Al-Nirin was a spectre dressed in ancient robes of royal design.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Habrauk Al-Nirin had all the powers of a spectre. He also appeared to any evil-aligned adventurers in the path of the Lancers of Death at night in the Desert of Al-Alisk as a face made of the night sky; when he did, he'd warn them to stay out of his business.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Habrauk was totally smitten with Princess Sithal Al-Husn 's beauty. He kidnapped her from the city of Akhir on the day of her wedding to Athis Al-Din , and placed her in an enchanted box to keep her beauty forever. By doing this, he started a blood feud that raged for five generations, before the dying desert and the killing finally ended the bloodlines of both his clan and those of Pazar and Akhir. Even then, the spirits of his clan and those of the slain were nightly joined in battle. The wizard Martek stole away a section of the desert containing both Akhir and the crypt, in order to use them as a test for adventurers seeking access into the Inner Sanctum of Martek .</p>
<p>The blood feud would continue to play out nightly until 1356 DR , when the Princess' spirit was finally released by adventurers after Martek's crystal minaret.</p>
