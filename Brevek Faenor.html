<p>Loremaster Most High Brevek Faenor was an ambitious worshiper of Oghma who tended the Unrolling Scroll shrine in Baldur's Gate .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Faenor was almost fifty years old as of 1482 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Brevek was a bookwork, and was often found reading tomes near the shrine or even in Gond 's library. He was also known to overhear other citizens of the city moaning about the Unrolling Scroll's speaking schedule.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 1480s DR, Brevek Faenor looked after the shrine dedicated to Oghma, though he was somewhat negligent of his duty. Instead of carting for this place of worship, he instead wanted to assume control of the High House of Wonders . All attempts he had made to do so were in vain. However, this did not put him off attempting the task again.</p>
