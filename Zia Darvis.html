<p>Zia Darvis ( pronounced : /ˈ z i ɑː / ZEE-a ) was a human woman of the town of Targos in Icewind Dale in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Her husband was Edgin Darvis , and together they had a daughter, Kira .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At one point while living together, Zia and Edgin found a sapphire dragonfly had gotten into their room as they lay in bed. As Edgin capered about trying to catch it, Zia simply laughed and opened a window to let it fly out. The sapphire dragonfly would ever after remind him of Zia and her smile.</p>
<p>Whilst Zia was pregnant with Kira in the mid-1480s DR, Edgin elected to join the Harpers . In a ceremony that took place beside a waterfall in the woods and was officiated by an elven High Harper, Zia stood behind him, supporting his choice to work for a good cause and understanding the risk that he might be killed on a mission, even if it meant Kira grew up without a father..</p>
<p>In his four years or so with the Harpers, Edgin defended Faerûn from "creatures, crooks, and cretins" as he put it. But given his family's modest living standards, Edgin came to chafe at his Harper code, even though Zia hardly cared. She would try to cheer him up, such as by throwing a bit of carrot at him when in a playful mood and trying to break him out of his despondency.</p>
<p>Then, one night, four Red Wizards of Thay and Thayan assassins rode into Targos seeking revenge after Edgin and other Harpers had captured a Red Wizard in his treasure-stuffed lair. But Edgin was away, so they attacked Zia, but not before she was able to hide the newborn Kira in a hidden compartment in the wall. When Edgin came home, he found Zia laying dying of an injury inflicted by a Red Wizard blade , meaning that no cleric could revive her. Afterward, Edgin blamed himself, for he had been tempted to steal a gold token from the Red Wizard's lair, little thinking it might be magically marked and lead the assassins right to his door. He abandoned his oath to the Harpers and burned his book of the Harper code upon Zia's funeral pyre. He noticed a familiar sapphire dragonfly hovering above the pyre. Her death left Edgin distrustful of all Thayans , fearing that working with even one such as the paladin Xenk Yendar would be betraying her memory.</p>
<p>Years later, Edgin would be persuaded to try to steal a tablet of reawakening , a magical relic capable of resurrecting even one slain by the Red Wizard blade , so that he might restore Zia to life. The ensuing heist would have disastrous consequences. Ultimately, though, Edgin would finally acquire the tablet of reawakening but his companion Holga Kilgore was then slain by the Red Wizard Sofina using a Red Wizard blade . As he and Kira grieved, a sapphire dragonfly alighted on Edgin's arm and flew off, and he realized that his and Kira's relationship to Holga was now much more important than clinging to the memory of his lost wife. Thus, Edgin and Kira chose to use the tablet's one charge to revive Holga instead. As Zia had once told him, he had let her go.</p>
