<p>Fingarl's Flame was an enchanted ruby originating in Chult and owned by the merchant Fingarl of Alaghôn in Turmish in the 14 th century DR before being famously stolen.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A ruby as big as its owner's head, it had an approximately pyramidal shape with its upper point curving to one side, making it reminiscent of a flame or an ox 's horn. Thanks to its enchantments, it glowed with a constant red light.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>As it was too big and cumbersome to be worn as jewelry, the ruby was enchanted to hover in the air and follow its owner just behind their right shoulder. It also produced light, similar to faerie fire with a continual red glow.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as a security measure, Fingarl's Flame would become incredibly hot and emit a deafening scream when moved over 200 yards (180 meters) from its owner, specifically, "from the eyes of Fingarl". This enchantment was placed by the wizard Thalaskos and was a secret known only to him, Fingarl, and a half-dozen of the merchant's trusted agents.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This great ruby was once found in the heart of Chult before it was transported out of the jungles by agents of the rich merchant Fingarl. At great expense, he had it enchanted by mages like Thalaskos and it followed him everywhere. Fingarl was even said to talk to it and stroke it, particularly when he was upset about something.</p>
<p>That was until Fingarl was found in his office one day, with both his ruby and his head missing! Thalaskos supposed the thief had learned of the security measure somehow and taken the merchant's head to circumvent it. Both remained missing as of around 1360 DR .</p>
