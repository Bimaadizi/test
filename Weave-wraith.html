<p>Weave-wraiths were undead of Netherese origin that had strange magical powers.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>At least one Weave-wraith resembled a net or cloak with arms and a head.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Weave-wraiths were known to be drawn to magic, and to feed off of it; at least one of them was insatiable and single-mindedly drawn to strong magic, even if it proved stronger than something he already knew he couldn't handle.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>These undead were known to have the ability to hide within the Weave , to sip at magic, or even feed off of them so completely that they drained items, or thwarted ongoing castings, growing stronger and more solid in the process. After absorbing enough magic, such as from spellfire , at least one of them was known to be able to mind-speak to distant beings. They were not drawn to silver fire in the same way, however.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At least one Weave-wraith was originally a Netherese wizard from the city of Jethaere , who bound himself into an enchanted object after their city began to lose its war against the phaerimm . He was released once the item was misused to destruction. In 1357Â DR , a number of Weave-wraiths converged on Silverymoon , where they played some havoc on the wards. Alustriel Silverhand took care of them, and they took refuge in the Weave . One of them, Evaereol Rathrane , followed Alustriel a little further, and then rode the Weave to Waterdeep when she spell-spoke with Laeral Silverhand , where it learned about spellfire and sought it out.</p>
<p>The rest of the Weave-wraiths instead rode Alustriel Silverhand, who bound them into herself, as Mystra had forbid their destruction until they committed a grievous sin such as attacking mages, magical wards, or depriving another of free will.</p>
