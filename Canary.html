<p>A canary ( pl : canaries ) was a species of bright yellow bird found in Faerûn that was notable for its song-like chirping.</p>
<h2>Species</h2>
<h2>Usages</h2>
<p>Canaries were a favored form of familiar or pet among shield dwarves .</p>
<p>Many dwarven miners of northern Faerûn, such as those of Earthfast , took caged canaries with them into the mines. If the air turned bad, then the canary died first. They adopted this practice as a certain glowing fungus , which changed color in bad air and was used by southern dwarves, tended to die in cold northern climates.</p>
<p>Ironlord Torg mac Cei of Earthfast developed a liking for them, and kept several as pets. He often carried a fine golden cage about with him, even on campaign and in battle.</p>
