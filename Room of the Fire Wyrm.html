<p>The Room of the Fire Wyrm was a room in Castle Obarskyr of Suzail .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Room of the Fire Wyrm was about two stories above where the ghost of the Princess and Regent Alusair Obarskyr kept a cache of healing draughts . It was at the far end of one of the palace wings.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The room was seldom used; it had a number of soft, stuffed beds of matched hues and many crimson draperies. There was a portrait of King Duar, almost certainly Duar Obarskyr , with cut-out eyes that allowed vigilance of the room from within a hidden passage.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The passage contained a trap at some point, which had since claimed a War Wizard .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Forty years prior to 1479Â DR , the room had been popular for trysts amongst courtiers; at that point the War Wizards took exclusive possession of the key.</p>
<p>Before the Council of the Dragon in 1479 DR, the ghost of Regent Alusair Obarskyr and the fugitive wizard Elminster Aumar used a passage around the room while sneaking through Castle Obarskyr , and briefly spied inside. There, they saw the War Wizard Raereene and the palace server Kreane in the midst of a tryst. The escapees stopped to look only briefly.</p>
