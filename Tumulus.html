<p>The Tumulus was the name given to a massive and mysterious egg-like object buried deep in the Northdark in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>While much of the Tumulus remained interred in the earth, one end of it emerged in a cavern situated some 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of Waterdeep and 10 miles (16 kilometers) beneath the surface, in the middledark .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>From the curved upper end, it was estimated to be an ovoid structure of solid stone and measuring approximately 2,000 feet (610 meters) from end to end. The exposed surface was carved all over with symbols, sigils, glyphs, and signs—all of them meaning 'death' in countless languages, some identified, some not. A number of these carried deadly spells that would kill anyone who even saw them. Many, but not all, have already been discharged, but more could still be active under the earth.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>While its origin and purpose were unknown, the Tumulus was thought to be older than even the elven realm of Illefarn , and that was founded circa −22,900 DR .</p>
<p>Over the ages, by 1372 DR , a few efforts had been undertaken to find an entrance, none of them determined, let alone successful.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The structure was rumored to be cemetery or tomb of some kind, hence its name, but this was unconfirmed.</p>
