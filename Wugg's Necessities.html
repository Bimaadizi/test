<p>Wugg's Necessities was a shop in the Lower Port of Skullport .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The shop was cluttered with a variety of dungeon exploration tools, with a strict policy of "you touch it, you've bought it," which deterred would-be browsers from casual examination of the wares.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Wugg's Necessities catered to adventurers seeking supplies for ventures into Undermountain . Wugg's offered basic equipment, including lanterns , ropes , and pitons , all of notably poor quality but priced as high as the market would tolerate.</p>
<p>In addition to selling equipment, Wugg's occasionally bought surplus adventuring gear from those returning from Undermountain. However, he offered no more than 15% of the actual value, profiting handsomely from the transaction. Despite his high prices and low-quality stock, Wugg’s shop remained frequented by those willing to pay for convenience, albeit at a premium.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Wugg's Necessities was owned by Thesophus Wugg , a resourceful trader of dubious reputation. Complaints from dissatisfied customers regarding the substandard quality of his ropes and other equipment prompted Wugg to hire S'nogg Mudmane as his shop guard. Unbeknownst to Wugg, S'nogg suffered from narcolepsy, often falling asleep behind a fabric curtain hung in an alcove at the rear of the shop. This curtain, originally intended to obscure the guard’s presence and add an element of deterrence, has had mixed results, as customers were frequently unsure whether S'nogg was awake and observing or not. Wugg, lacking the courage to confront his formidable, easily angered minotaur employee, has yet to replace him.</p>
