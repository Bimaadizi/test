<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , during one of his escapades, Garrett learned of a treasure hidden within a lost temple underneath Westgate. The Hidden House , a temple to Leira , a dead power, was accessible via a certain magical ritual, which was uncovered by Garrett. He was an ambitious man and smart enough to know that lost temples tended to house forgotten dangers. Garrett needed muscle to accompany him into the Hidden House. He approached a small group of adventurers led by a recent arrival to Westgate on a quest opposing the nefarious Night Masks , offering them partnership in pillaging the lost temple. Garrett offered the adventurers all the treasure they would find, except for a single item, which he would not reveal until the item was found. He was searching for a great Leiran artifact known as the Cloak of Mysteries .</p>
<p>The group followed Garrett to a statue in front of a nobleman's mansion, where the ritual was performedâ€”a recitation of a prayer to Leira, which transported them into the underground temple. Within the dark, abandoned sacred ground, the group was met by a priestly ghost who demanded that the intruders begone. The adventurers ignored her warnings, Garrett noticing that the ghost of a slain priestess did not look particularly sad, and continued into the magical labyrinth of teleporting chambers.</p>
<p>When they reached the inner chambers, it became obvious that the ghost was just an illusion created by the oni mage Skyrim to scare intruders away from his new lair. The adventurers and Garrett battled the oni and his ogre and orc henchmen, defeating them and driving the monsters away from the ruined temple. They collected the Cloak of Mysteries from the oni's possessions. However, it was not known if the adventurers slew Garrett over the artifact, allowed the man to claim his bounty, or left the temple and the artifact behind in peace.</p>
