<p>The Trollslayer was a unique enchanted bastard sword especially effective against trolls .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The crimson blade possessed a +1 enchantment and became a powerful +4 enchantment when wielded against trolls of any breed. In addition to slashing damage, the Trollslayer burned its targets, helping to actually dispatch trolls once they were brought down.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Trollslayer was created by a wizard named Epp the Foolhardy for the spellcaster's ranger companion Farl Greenbog , who spent his life exterminating the troll population in northwest Faerûn . With Trollslayer in hand and Epp at his side, Farl managed to push trolls further south, away from his homelands. However, the triumph was short-lived as the ranger was ambushed and slain by a band of troll shamans and Epp the Foolhardy could not reach his ally in time. Epp incinerated the shamans with his spells and recovered the Trollslayer from deep in the marshland.</p>
<p>By 1281 DR , the Trollslayer had found its way to the hands of Conlan , the smith of Kuldahar , a village on the Spine of the World , who had it up for sale.</p>
