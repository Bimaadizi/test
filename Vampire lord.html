<p>Vampire lords were especially powerful vampires that often led their own armies of lesser undead .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Vampire lords possessed a number of innate powers, including immunity to disease and poison , resistance to necrotic energy and natural regeneration . They were however quite vulnerable to radiant energy .</p>
<p>These powerful vampires were capable of raising recently-slain beings as servants, known as vampire spawn .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Like lesser vampires, vampire lords could heal wounds they suffered by draining the blood of their victims. Their mere gaze could dominate the minds of weaker foes.</p>
<p>When truly threatened, vampire lords could transform into mist for up to one hour, and flee from danger.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>While most vampires remained solitary, they banded together on occasion under the leadership of a powerful vampire lord.</p>
<p>Each vampire lord was bound to a certain resting place―such as a tomb or sepulcher―within it had to rest for a number of hours each day.</p>
<p>Initiate deathbringers of the Night Masks would take part in a horrific ritual in which they would consume their own blood out of the veins of a vampire lord. This would twist their nature into a more horrific form, allowing them to commit the most heinous acts in the name of their guild.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Seductive Cambion, 1444 DR , the city of Elturel in the Western Heartlands was conquered by a vampire lord. It could only be wrested from the lord's control by divine intervention from the solar Zariel , who created a false sun to drive its undead minions away.</p>
