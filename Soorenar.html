<p>Soorenar was a city-state located on the western coast of the Bay of Chessenta that headed the Northern Alliance , one of the three most powerful alliances in Chessenta as of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<p>Following the events of the Spellplague , the city was destroyed, and the flooded ruins came to be known as Drowned Soorenar during the 15 th century DR.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Prior to its destruction, the city of Soorenar was a large, mercantile metropolis that boasted a popular and thriving theater district.</p>
<p>After its destruction, the ruined city sat submerged and abandoned, and only the tallest of Soorenar's buildings broke the waterline. Hardly any trace remained of the old inhabitants save for rumors of their wealth still lying underwater.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Soorenar was located on the coast of the Bay of Chessenta at the delta of the River Akax , which split the city into East Soorenar—where the docks, warehouses, and amenities for mercenaries were located—and the well-defended West Soorenar—where most of the city's residents lived. Its location made it one of the primary Chessentan ports on the Inner Sea .</p>
<p>Following the lowering of the Inner Sea as a result of the Spellplague and the opening of the Underchasm , the Bay of Chessenta shrank, thus leaving Drowned Soorenar fairly far inland along the River Akax on very the eastern edge of the newly formed Lake Akax .</p>
<p>Mudmen were known to be especially numerous in the shallow waters north of the city.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Prior to its destruction, the city operated under a variant of the legal system known as the Code of Enlil , which allowed accused criminals to defend themselves before a jury and held that crimes committed to stop greater crimes were blameless.</p>
<p>The city was ruled by a triumvirate of lords, and any decision that affected Soorenar had to be agreed upon by all three of them. Each of these rulers represented one of Soorenar's three most powerful noble families: the Thuriks , Yashurs , and Brolkchants . These families traced their lineage back to the three families who founded the city, and were related to the ruling families of Luthcheq .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Most of Soorenar's food came from the fertile Akanul region, and agricultural goods from the Akanul also passed through the port on they way to other destinations. Farmlands on the outskirts of the city also grew some produce, such as turnips .</p>
<p>Unlike some other ports on the Inner Sea, the city had no notable relationship with the undersea nations of Serôs .</p>
<p>The city hosted a notable Thayan enclave .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, Soorenar wielded its wealth as a weapon, hiring mercenaries and spellcasters to do their dirty work. Even so, it boasted a navy and an army of 5,000—made up of 3,000 infantry, 1,000 cavalry, and 1,000 archers—which could easily be boosted to as many as 15,000 by hiring mercenaries and conscripting citizens and slaves . The lords of Soorenar had no scruples about hiring ruthless mercenary groups, such as the Renegades . Like most city-states in Chessenta, Soorenar had a 3-year cache of food preserved by magic for use in case of war.</p>
<p>The city was allied with Mordulkin , Airspur , and Luthcheq—although their willingness to employ wizards sometimes put them in conflict with Luthcheq. Soorenar's troops, along with those of Luthcheq and Mordulkin, manned the Drakelight watchtower at the tip of Watcher's Cape , which was used to signal the arrival of pirates sailing into the Bay of Chessenta from the Sea of Fallen Stars . Ports under the protection of Soorenar generally greeted such pirates with a wizard lobbing fireballs .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Soorenar was founded after Chessenta gained its independence from Unther in the Year of Flashing Eyes, 929 DR , by the three families whose armies were said to have driven the Untherites out. Until the Year of the Twelverule, 1117 DR , Soorenar belonged to the Chessentan Empire, founded by the "Invincible Warrior" Tchazzar .</p>
<p>In the years following the empire's collapse, Soorenar's alliances and enemies were constantly shifting. For example, they allied with Akanax at the Siege of Cimbar in the Year of the Sun Underground, 1154 DR —the outcome of which was to greatly reduce Cimbar 's power in the region —but also waged a notable war against Akanax in the Year of the Bright Blade, 1347 DR , which left Akanax in ruins. In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Soorenar allied with Airspur to attack Cimbar, set on dividing the city between them, although Soorenar began to fare poorly in this war. Then, during the Time of Troubles one year later, the avatar of Hoar sought to punish Soorenar, Cimbar, and Luthcheq in for ancient slights, and so incited the army of Akanax against all three.</p>
<p>In the decade that followed, Soorenar would ally with Airspur in another war against Akanax, which was complicated by attacks on their mercenaries by the City of the Werecrocodiles in the Adder Swamp . By the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Soorenar had a reputation for aggressive rulers who preferred to purchase victories rather than fight for them. The city had designs to rule over all of Chessenta, but was staunchly opposed by both Cimbar and Akanax. Soorenar enjoyed very little internal dissent during this time until the city was infiltrated by naztharune rakshasas serving a mysterious pair of ak'chazar rakshasas operating out of Unthalass . They embedded themselves in local guilds and assassinated politicians and merchants in order to stir up discontent with the goal of sparking war between the Chessentan city states.</p>
<p>On Nightal 1 of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Tchazzar returned to Chessenta in his true form: the red dragon chosen of Tiamat . He first appeared above an ongoing naval conflict between Soorenar and Cimbar, and proceeded to annihilate both fleets. In the wake of this attack, Tchazzar seized control of Cimbar and used it as a base to grow the religion dedicated to himself . As he attempted to spread his influence, Soorenar was at the forefront of efforts to oppose him. They engaged in secret negotiations with Cimbar while hiring mercenaries to fight them. They were also rumored to be offering an enormous bounty to any who could provide them with powerful spells to contain the dragon, such as those developed by Sammaster during the recent Rage of Dragons .</p>
<p>Much of Chessenta was devastated during the events of the Spellplague and the violent arrival of Akanûl in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , and Soorenar was no exception. Amidst earthquakes and cataclysms, water swept into the city and reduced it to a flooded ruin known as "Drowned" Soorenar. As of the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR , much of the city's old wealth was said to still lie below the waters, and so the site was a popular destination for treasure hunters and adventurers seeking to make a name for themselves.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>There was a sharp divide between the ruling nobles and the peasants, slaves, and tradesfolk, who were broadly seen as beneath the ruling elite's notice or concern.</p>
<p>Prior to his return to Toril , Tchazzar's church had a strong following in Soorenar.</p>
