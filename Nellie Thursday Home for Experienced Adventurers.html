<p>Nellie Thursday Home for Experienced Adventurers was a retirement home for those adventurers that had spent most of their money during their adventuring days and now had to settle for being close to poor.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The retirement home lay upon a main road some two days travel from the hamlet of Murrow's Dell on foot, about half that by horse.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>A fireplace stood in the front room of the building, and Nellie Thursday 's dwarven thrower usually hung upon the mantle.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Those old adventurers who had neglected to save up for retirement, yet survived into old age, could find a place in the Nellie Thursday Home for Experienced Adventurers. Here they would lodge one or two people to a room, fuss around and swap stories about their former lives and enjoy the little luxuries their money could buy.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nellie Thursday established the home once she herself were on the wrong side of 200 years old. Creating the retirement home in order to house others who where done adventuring about, and ofcourse making some good money by catering to the different whims of the retirees. After more than a hundred years of successful operations, a former lodger Exeter , once of the Company of the Swan , disappeared from the retirement home. Fifteen years later he sent several threats to the retirement home and another old lodger and former roommate of Exeter; Wemick . The Company of the Swan went out to confront their old rogue member, but while the were trying to locate Exeter, Exeter came back to the retirement home alongside hired henchmen, a devil, and some 50 mercenaries and proceeded to hold Nellie and the other residents hostage. 6 magical gems, created by Exeter, were planted around the retirement home, if another 6 gems, the counterparts to the ones placed around the building, were brought together they would cause an earthquake destroying the entire building. Exeter forced the Company of the Swan to duel his henchmen at high noon near the home, finally dueling Wemick the Wise himself. The home would be saved by the old adventurers and Nellie herself.</p>
