<p>Talltrees was a treetop village of the Elmanesse tribe of elves in the Wealdath , ruined in 1364 DR at the hand of the cutthroat captain Bunlap .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The village consisted of a series of homes and huts among the boughs of the towering forest, with the trees themselves made to be hollow. Between them, the elves tied swaying walkways. Its inhabitants were further prudent enough to camouflage their home among the nature surrounding them, meaning Talltrees was not in plain sight; anyone on the ground found it impossible to actually see the village unless they stood right beneath its center-most point.</p>
<p>Its destruction involved terrible fires, which caused the Elmanesse to flee and left much of the settlement marked and ruined. Only portions of Talltrees' highest residences survived. After the conflict, however, the ground beneath was taken back by ample prey animals (and their predators), multiple potable pools of water, and, if the season was right, an abundance of berries to feast upon.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Within the greater whole of the Wealdath, Talltrees was vaguely equidistant between the village of Mosstone on the Trade Way , which lay to its south-west, and the ancient city of Myth Rhynn , to its north-east.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>In one version of Volo's Guide to the Lands of Intrigue , its ever-reliable author suspected that it was only a matter of time before the Wealdath and the Elmanesse both recovered from Bunlap's attack and the elves came home to Talltrees.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>No elves remained after Talltrees' destruction, but one occasionally returned to its branches: the Duke of Noromath , Allain "Foxfire" Kevanarial . In such cases, he would use the village's highest sections, those in somewhat working order, to deal with any responsibilities he might have had or to orchestrate meetings with fey creatures and other elves.</p>
