<p>Corinna was a squirrel that lived in or around the Emerald Grove during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Corinna and another squirrel named Spar encountered the tiefling woman Alfira , singing and playing her lute at a secluded spot in the druid's grove. The nutty pair deemed her performance so terrifyingly awful that the two squirrel friends could barely stand to be in her presence.</p>
