<p>The Crystal Labyrinth was the 16 th level of the Waterdhavian dungeon complex of Undermountain and a sublevel of one of the dungeon's Dark Levels. It contained a portal to Stardock , an asteroid in the Tears of Selûne . Originally an ever-changing maze designed by Halaster Blackcloak , in the late 15 th century DR it was occupied by the githyanki , who converted it into a fortress.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Crystal Labyrinth was almost entirely composed of a luminous crystalline material that shed its own light and changed color periodically. The doors throughout the level were composed of a white opaque crystal similar to stone.</p>
<h3>Entrances</h3>
<p>A pathway descended into the Crystal Labyrinth from the Obstacle Course . Throughout the corridor, the wall material was gradually replaced by veins of the luminous crystal.</p>
<p>There were no less than four portals into the labyrinth, one on each of the four sides of the maze. The north portal was connected to a wine cellar in the Snome family villa in Waterdeep and was only active on Shieldmeet . The east portal came from an abandoned tomb in the Ardeep Forest . The south gate was coterminous with a doorway in a barracks in the city of Saradush in far-away Tethyr , and was only active when it was raining in Saradush. The west doorway brought unsuspecting victims in from a damp cellar beneath the Copper Cup festhall in Waterdeep. Normally, these portals were one-way into the Crystal Labyrinth, but during the event known as Halaster's Higharvestide , they were all active and temporarily two-way gates .</p>
<h3>Exits</h3>
<p>There were two known exits from the Crystal Labyrinth:</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>In the 15 th century DR, the path downwards to Seadeeps was heavily guarded. The githyanki were aware of the mind flayer colony below, so they kept an assortment of magic traps and a permanent detachment of crystal golems on watch.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Crystal Labyrinth was originally built by the drow sometime before the 2 nd century DR as a training center for young soldiers.</p>
<p>Sometime in the late 15 th century DR, a group of githyanki led by Al'chaia arrived at the Crystal Labyrinth while tracking down a colony of mind flayers in the level of Seadeeps. Upon discovery of the portal leading to Stardock, they converted the abandoned asteroid into a crèche for the breeding and training of young githyanki, which they named Crèche K'liir. The labyrinth was converted into a fortress from where they led attacks against the mind flayers and protected the access to Stardock.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The level was inhabited by numerous githyanki knights and gishes . A family of red dragons led by Ashtyrranthor also lived in the labyrinth and moved back and forth to Stardock in order to protect it. The githyanki regularly built crystal golems to serve as guards and reinforcements.</p>
