<p>Blackclaw was a dark stalker who led the Glumguts family of dark creepers in the Shadowfell city of Evernight as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Blackclaw was harsh and wrathful. He would inflict surprising and cruel punishments on his subordinates for any insult or failure. He spoke with a snarl.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He wore black clothes and wielded a scimitar .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As of 1479Â DR , Blackclaw and the Glumguts were employed by agents of Netheril to maintain their consulate in Evernight: a mansion that came to be known as the dark creeper enclave . The Netherese forbade them from attacking or stealing from any of the city's undead citizens lest their actions embarrass the Netherese or disrupt their operations. Blackclaw was quick to punish anyone who violated these rules or who put the family at risk.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Blackclaw was rightly feared among his subordinates in the Glumguts family, and only three of them dared to challenge him, although this took the form of pranks and activities that might embarrass him or his Netherese employers. These three included his own son, Blackcut , and his cousins, Thrax and Vynnia . While Blackclaw was somewhat aware of their antics, he was unaware of the damage they had done to Netheril's reputation. The three were under the (mistaken) assumption that Blackcut's familial ties could protect them from Blackclaw's wrath if he ever discovered what they were doing.</p>
