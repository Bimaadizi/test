<p>Luthax was a War Wizard of Cormyr in the 7 th century DR . After death, he was resurrected as a ghazneth .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was senior officer to Thanderahast . He had Elmariel Emmarask as a trusted friend.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Luthax had a protruding belly under his robes. He had a furrowed face and a large nose, a shaved-bald head and a well-groomed beard.</p>
<p>As ghazneth, his legs were underdeveloped, so he depended largely on his wings to pick up a decent running speed.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Empty Hearth, 629 DR , Luthax conspired with Elmariel Emmarask, who had brought back a magical beast from the ruins of Netheril . They aimed to kill King Draxius Obarskyr , but their plot was foiled when Thanderahast alerted the king. Amedahast found the conspirators and detonated her magical staff , killing herself, Elmariel, and the others in the room.</p>
<p>However, Luthax survived somehow, because he was seen by Thanderahast in the Battle with the Witch Lords nearly 300 years later, in the Year of the Thirsty Sword, 900 DR .</p>
<p>Eventually, he was resurrected as the fifth ghazneth in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , but it remained unknown what tree he was buried under or exactly when he died.</p>
