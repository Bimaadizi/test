<p>The Dusk Circle was a druidic circle based in Westwood and later in the portion of Kryptgarden Forest , nestled in the foothills of the Sword Mountains in the Sword Coast North during the late 14 th century DR . They lived in near isolation, in a few glades whose floors were covered in moss. They had only one winding trail that led from their home in the forest, down the hills to the town of Red Larch .</p>
<p>Anyone who promised not to fell any trees, and who brought a donation in the name of Silvanus or Mielikki , was granted a night or two's stay within the druids' glade.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The three druids of the Dusk Circle would direct the loggers of the nearby town of Kheldell to what areas of the forest they could fell. The woodsmen would then typically plant more trees than were cut down.</p>
