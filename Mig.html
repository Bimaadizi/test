<p>Mig was an ogress follower of the Absolute in the Moonrise Towers during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Mig was among those who joined the new religions that sprang in the Western Heartlands . The ogress joined after being promised food – meat. She was stationed within the Moonrise Towers – the fortress controlled by the Absolute's warlord – General Ketheric Thorm . Mig was seemingly the only cultist who paid attention to moving sounds all throughout the towers. These sounds came from the colossal spread of the Netherbrain 's tentacles deep in the walls of the Moonrise – the true identity of the Absolute. Slithering sounds of the Absolute made Mig hungry.</p>
<p>According to some, Mig may had been slain during the True Soul heroes and Harper attack on the Moonrise Towers that ended Ketheric Thorm's undead existence.</p>
