<p>Korlasz was a wizard who came from a family that worshiped the deities of the Dead Three . As a devout follower of Bhaal and a devotee of Sarevok Anchev , Korlasz played a significant role in the Bhaalspawn 's attempted coup of the Council of Four in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Korlasz did not have the same leadership qualities as Sarevok, though tried in earnest to lead.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Korlasz's mother was a mage and her father was a devout Bhaalite priest .</p>
<p>She was a trusted disciple of Sarevok and even served as a sort of confidant. Korlasz even offered him her family's crypt to him as a secure headquarters from which he could carry out his plans.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Bhaal died during the Avatar Crisis , in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Korlasz shifted her devotion to the Maiden of Pain, Loviatar . This was done as a temporary measure however, as she re-dedicated herself to aiding Bhaal's return to the pantheon .</p>
<p>A decade later, in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Korlasz offered resources to Sarevok during his brief rise to power in Baldur's Gate. She was trusted enough to oversee his followers when it was required for him to leave the city.</p>
<p>After his death, Korlasz and Sarevok's other disciples could not flee Baldur's Gate, due to the large number of refugees sought shelter from the Shining Crusade . She arranged for the theft of Sarevok's Sword of Chaos from the Ducal Palace , in order to sell it to an anonymous party in Athkatla and fund their escape to Zazesspur . While she managed to get the greatsword onto a ship to Amn , she was thwarted by the Hero of Baldur's Gate , who just a matter of days prior slew Sarevok himself.</p>
