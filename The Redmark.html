<p>The Redmark was a relatively new establishment, as of 1367 DR , in Harrowdale that catered to rich merchants from sembia . The Redmark was named for a mercenary band called Orlyn's Redmark .</p>
<h2>Locations</h2>
<p>The Redmark was located at the southern end of town on Melurk Street , making it the first inn merchants traveling north from Sembia saw when visiting the town, though the smell from nearby fishing huts could be offputting.</p>
<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
<p>Each room was furnished with its own bathing tub at the Redmark. Meeting rooms could be rented for a small fee. The main dining room specialized in fresh seafood.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>A bit of controversy surrounded the construction of the Redmark as the two builders of the inn, Gathand Wyrlder and Bergun Zeltyl ,disappeared after the inn was completed. Since their disappearance several guests arrived and dismantled their rooms as if searching for something, leading locals to believe that the inn was constructed with money that did not belong to the owners. These suspicious guests also tried seizing legitimate coins made by the inn as they were en route to Treskeden House or Velarstown Silver and Jewelry .</p>
<p>The inn was run by Alark Phlamtryn in 1367 DR. He hired the Stormblades mercenary band for protection from any future suspicious guests.</p>
