<p>Korboz was king of the rock gnome clan at Gnomengarde in the late 15 th century DR . He ruled alongside his husband, King Gnerkli .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>In addition to his innate gnomish abilities, Korboz (like everyone else in Gnomengarde) had some training as a wizard . In combat, he preferred to attack with spells like ray of frost and magic missile .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Korboz wore a patchwork cape and a jagged metal crown to signify his status as king. He possessed a hat of wizardry which he was happy to part with as a show of gratitude to one who had earned his thanks.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Korboz cared deeply for his husband, Gnerkli, although this manifested horrifyingly after he went mad and imprisoned Gnerkli ostensibly for his own protection.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in the late 15 th century DR, around the same time that the white dragon Cryovain began terrorizing the area around Phandalin and Gnomengarde, Korboz was attacked in his throne room by a mimic disguised as a rug. The shock drove him mad, and led to him fearing for his life and the life of his beloved Gnerkli. He imprisoned Gnerkli in their bedchamber by gluing him to a chair and jealously guarding the solvent that could free him, and then locked them both inside to let the mimic run wild through Gnomengarde. Only once he was convinced the mimic had been slain, and that his belief that a shapechanger was running amok in his home was proven true, could his madness begin to abate. During this time, some of his subjects began calling him Mad King Korboz.</p>
