<p>Skred was a male troglodyte barbarian who roamed the Deep Wastes on raids for his tribe.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Skred wore studded leather armor and gauntlets on his raids. He typically wrapped himself in a cloak and wielded an over-sized morningstar .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He took great enjoyment in battle, especially close-quarters fighting. Skred's sojourns were often motivated by the allure of acquiring treasure from those he defeated.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>A fine tracker, Skred was an experienced traveler in the Underdark and was quite good at listening to his quarry's movements. In battle, although not overly strong, he was a furious combatant who wielded an over-sized morningstar with deadly effect. If needed, Skred could shift his attacks to smash an opponent's weapon or intersperse vicious swipes of his claw between his morningstar's blows. Despite his barbarian rages leaving him heedless to attacks, Skred could rely on his uncanny reflexes and troglodyte stench to see him through a fight.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>On Skred's hunts, he was well-equipped with a number of magic items . He wore studded leather armor +2 , a cloak of resistance +2 and a ring of protection +1 on his finger. A set of gauntlets of ogre power helped improve his strength above average for wielding his giant-sized morningstar +2 more effectively. In battle he would make careful use of his javelin of lightning and his potion of haste .</p>
<h2>Relationship</h2>
<p>Skred worked ably alongside Theod , a fellow barbarian in their raiding group. Both of them respected the commands of their leader, Latar , and followed his clever battle plans, even if it meant delaying attacks or attacking from range.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hailing from a troglodyte settlement in the Deep Wastes , Skred became one the most experienced warriors in the raiding group led by Latar , a cleric of Laogzed . In 1372 DR , Skred joined with Latar, Theod , and many other troglodytes to cause mayhem in the tunnels between Szith Morcane and Maerimydra . However, after causing much chaos, the group's numbers waned, and they started to become desperate to find some real plunder before returning home.</p>
