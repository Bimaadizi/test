<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Storna led the Night Brigade from strength to strength through ruthlessness and guile. After years of work, their power was solidified when they attacked and nearly destroyed the far less militant Riverside Rats gang of wererats , taking their hideout and transforming it into a Temple of Shar . The few survivors escaped through the Wererat's Entrance to the exterior of the prison, where they recruited some opportunistic allies to lead the counterattack. After the slaying of her lieutenants Master Thief Karissa , Battlemaster Agarta , and her Grand Arcanist Darstil Vurusk , Garmor the Grim set a mission to finish off Storna and destroy the gang once and for all. With the subtle assistance of Sel√ªne helping to dispel the darkness and despair that filled the temple, the avengers broke through Storna's devotees and living shadow defenders, finally meeting her in battle. She met her end stoically, knowing that she had fulfilled her duty to Shar as best she could.</p>
