<p>Torleth's Treasures was a shop in Gillian's Hill , a hamlet along the Trade Way , that specialized in oddities, curios, antiques, and junk. It was owned by Torleth Mindulspeer in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Torleth's Treasures stood just off the northern patch of Trade Way that passed through the hamlet.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Torleth's Treasures was located in a chaotic-looking old barn. The main structure was expanded, seemingly at random in various directions over the years the store was in operation. Every expansion was done by a different set of hands and each part of the structure had different floors and roofs.</p>
<p>Torleth's office was a small room flooded with books to the right off the main entrance. The only way to access the basement was a door on the opposite part of the shop. The basement was a simple stone-covered hall with exit doors on each side, one led to the outside and another into the interior of Torleth's Treasures. One gated room, the vault, was hidden behind a locked and trapped gate where Torleth kept his most precious items not intended for sale.</p>
<p>The store's sign hung on the side of the building by the front door. By 1372 DR, the sign looked battered by age and elements, spotted with flaking and washed-out paint , and screeched with un- oiled hinges .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The patchwork interior was just as random as the shack's outside. Inside, rough tree trunks propped up the ceiling, while functioning as additional display, with many pegs holding up dangling merchandise. The interior of the shop was a labyrinth of curios and antiques of all types and sizes, leaving customers wandering poorly-lit passages in search of an exit.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Torleth was a junk and antique enthusiast who loved to collecting old and strange things. He purchased "garbage" from derelict buildings, old ships, things excavated from ancient dungeons , and took them off the hands of traveling merchants from all corners of the Realms . His collection has such random items as a Valashar dancer's mask, a Calishite harem mirror with an enchanted image of a snake circling in its glass , rope soaked in adventurers ' blood, old bottles filled with wine , presumably, lifted from the seabed, books in strange and unknown languages, a stuffed wyvern head with a single missing tooth, exotic clothings from other countries and regions, Torleth offered all these things and haggled for them happily. The store was also chock-filled with equipment that belonged to armies long-forgotten in the 14 th century DR : tents , polearms , giant and sprite helmets , a 50 feet (15 meters) long stirring oar , dragon teeth, stone lions , obscure coats of arms, coracles , ettercap silk glands, bodak teeth, seagull feathers, coldstones , quartz chunks , a saintsblood pearl , a bag of dust of disappearance , a stray chime of opening , and many more.</p>
<p>Torleth's Treasures was especially popular among thieves , actors, and bards for its collection of great costumes and historically accurate props.</p>

<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The locals loved tell stories and gossip about all the great finds accomplished in Torleth's Treasures. The rumors were many and likely untrue as some claimed that a authentic crown of a barony from Vilhon Reach was once purchased from Torleth for 33 gold pieces, another tale told about an artist's sketchbook that hid a rare spell hidden within its images-sold for 11 gp , a rare version of a ring of resistance , called Harvyn's ring , was sold for 4,000 gp and the buyer later discovered additional magical properties, like the ability to use the spell jump and summon invisible swords that could cut through magical barriers.</p>
