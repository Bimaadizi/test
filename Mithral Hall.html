<p>Mithral Hall (sometimes spelled Mithril Hall ) was a dwarven stronghold beneath Fourthpeak Mountain in the Frost Hills , part of the Spine of the World . It was one of the best known dwarven strongholds in Faerûn .</p>
<p>Originally a mithral mine belonging to Clan Battlehammer , this underground town became a safe haven for various dwarf families and even some persons of other races. Mithral Hall had a long history of tragedy and triumph, and was the making and breaking of countless individuals.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Set amongst the longest mountain range in Faerûn, Mithral Hall was one of the northernmost settlements on the continent.</p>
<h3>Settlestone</h3>
<p>An ancient village south of Mithral Hall, Settlestone was one of the few dwarven settlements built entirely above ground. Originally known as Dwarvendarrow , the settlement was built with huge slabs of rock laid against one another. These sturdy structures withstood the elements for years and even survived several centuries after the village was abandoned.</p>
<p>Used by the occupants of Mithral Hall as a public front and forward base, Settlestone was first resettled in 1357 DR by Reghedmen barbarians from Icewind Dale led by Berkthgar , although the barbarians only stayed for a few years. Settlestone was also populated with around 200 dwarf guards that regulated traffic around Mithral Hall and kept the surrounding area free from monsters.</p>
<h3>Keeper's Dale</h3>
<p>Keeper's Dale was the name given to the high mountain valley, that surrounded the northwestern entrance to Mithral Hall. It was wide and deep and rocky. To navigate it was treacherous and arduous, due to the craggy outcrops and unstable edges.</p>
<p>The steps on Keeper's Dale that led to the entrance of the hall were carefully carved where two different types of rock met. This provided camouflage and meant the steps could only be seen from the correct angle, or by those in the know. Hence the door was well concealed.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Once inside the town, one was faced with a maze of tunnels and numerous caves and rooms. To navigate the tunnels required an experienced guide or several years of experience spelunking within them. Mithral Hall was an ever-expanding settlement as the residents were constantly mining for more mithral . [ citation needed ] The tunnels and chambers of Mithral Hall were a self-contained city complete with taverns, forges, workshops, homes, and shrines to Moradin , Clangeddin , and Dumathoin .</p>
<h3>Entrances</h3>
<p>There were two primary ways into Mithral Hall, along with a number of hidden, thin chimneys used for ventilation. Additionally, the lowest levels of the mine opened up into the Underdark .</p>
<h3>Notable Locations</h3>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After being built by Gandalug Battlehammer and his kin, Mithral Hall accumulated a long and fascinating history filled with all manner of heroes, villains, victory and defeat.</p>
<h3>Origin</h3>
<p>Although the exact date when Mithral Hall was founded is unknown, it was before 0 DR . The Hall was founded by Gandalug Battlehammer. (It is however reported in Hall of Heroes that Bunko Battlehammer was the founder of Mithral Hall, however this has been contradicted in several other works so is considered an error.) The settlement was originally set up as a mine, due to the rich seams of mithral ore in the mountain. The business quickly grew into a thriving community. The location of Mithral Hall was kept extremely secret, so that other organizations wouldn't try invading. The dwarves used to sell their ore and weapons in Settlestone, using it as a public front for the mine. This way outsiders were not exposed to the secret location of the mine. [ citation needed ]</p>
<h3>Shimmergloom's Reign</h3>
<p>Towards the end of the 1100s DR, the deepest mines carved out by the dwarves of Mithral Hall broke into a shadowcavern. The cavern was said to be linked to the Plane of Shadows. An immensely powerful shadow dragon named Haerinvureem , better known as Shimmergloom, was subsequently released into the mines. [ citation needed ]</p>
<p>The dragon, who later became known as Shimmergloom, was aided by hordes of shadow creatures and a whole clan of duergar . The loyal dwarves stood and fought allowing the few not strong enough the opportunity to flee. Among those that escaped was a young Bruenor Battlehammer. [ citation needed ]</p>
<p>The dragon ravaged Mithral Hall slaying thousands of dwarves. Thibbledorf Pwent was one of the few dwarves that fought in the battle and survived, although he was presumed dead for quite some time. Bangor Battlehammer and his father Garumn Battlehammer died in the battle slaying hordes of Duergar. As they died their surrounding area was probably cursed as their bodies and possessions remained untouched centuries later.</p>
<p>The 300 or so dwarves that escaped fled to the nearby Settlestone where they waited for news, expecting their kin to emerge victorious and invite them back. The good news never came, and the few dwarves that ventured back into Mithral Hall looking for survivors did not return. What was a settlement of 10,000 was cut down to 300.</p>
<h3>Reclaiming Mithral Hall</h3>
<p>Ever since leaving his home when he was a young dwarf, Bruenor Battlehammer had wanted to reclaim Mithral Hall and avenge his kin. After spending many years living at the clan's new home in Icewind Dale , the aged and respected Bruenor decided it was time to return to Mithral Hall. Although he had always intended to return the sudden decision to begin the quest in 1356 DR came after he completed the forging of Aegis-fang .</p>
<p>Bruenor set off along with Drizzt Do'Urden , Regis , and Wulfgar , who later became known as the Companions of the Hall . The journey to find Mithral Hall was a long one, as even Bruenor had forgotten many of the details of its whereabouts. They eventually tracked it down with the help of rumors, clues and, most significantly, a memory inducing potion. The combination of these aids led them to Settlestone (known at the time as "the Ruins") where they stayed the night. In the morning they set off along a narrow path towards Fourthpeak Mountain. Along the way they ran into some trouble with another group who had been following them. That group consisted of a golem created by Dendybar , his apprentice, Sydney, and Artemis Entreri , an assassin on a mission to track down Regis and the magical ruby he used to charm others. Entreri also had with him Catti-brie , Bruenor's adopted human daughter. After almost a day's hiking they reached Keeper's Dale but didn't know the ancient command code to open the hidden door.</p>
<p>They waited until the next day, and used Aegis-Fang's magic to reveal the door.</p>
<p>Once inside they set about navigating the complicated tunnels. Along the way they encountered the dusty bodies of Bangor and Garumn Battlehammer , Bruenor's father and grand-father. After laying them to rest in a nearby room, and donning Bangor's Armor, Bruenor proclaimed himself the Eighth King of Mithral Hall.</p>
<p>A series of minor events occurred in the tunnels before reaching Shimmergloom, who after being disturbed appeared in Garumn's Gorge. Faced with no alternative Bruenor doused himself in oil from a nearby store room, leapt onto Shimmergloom (pouring oil on his scales) and set light to both of them. The brave dwarf and fearsome dragon roared down the natural abyss in a spectacular fireball. In the aftermath Regis was kidnapped and the bridge across the gorge destroyed. Drizzt, Wulfgar and Catti-brie were forced to edge their way around the chasm to reach the eastern exit, where they left assuming Bruenor had been killed in the fireball.</p>
<p>In fact Bruenor had miraculously survived the scorching fall thanks to Drizzt's magical sword, Icingdeath . After clambering from the dead dragon's body, he made his way through Mithral Hall. With Shimmergloom dead, all that was left to do was clear out the shadow dragon's vermin. Bruenor slayed vast numbers of duergar as he made his way through the tunnels and rooms. He eventually escaped the complex by climbing up one of the furnace chimney's where he encountered (and was bitten by) a giant spider .</p>
<p>Although he managed to kill the spider, its venom quickly made its way through his body, and as he reached the surface and the daylight struck his face, he lost consciousness. He woke up in the care of Alustriel Silverhand who had foreseen his predicament and rushed to his aid.</p>
<p>Once Mithral Hall was free from the dragon, the Companions of the Hall led an army composed of 500 Reghedmen , 8000 dwarves from Citadel Felbarr and Clan Battlehammer, a few members of the Harpell clan and archers from Silverymoon and Nesmé to clear out its duergar minions. Within less than a month, it was once again suitable for habitation. Many of the dwarves of Clan Battlehammer left the Dwarven Valley of Icewind Dale and resettled within the home of their ancestors.</p>
<h3>Battle of Keeper's Dale</h3>
<p>In the year 1358 DR an army of drow , goblins and kobolds led by House Baenre attacked Mithral Hall, from Menzoberranzan . The defending dwarves soon received aid from svirfneblin from Blingdenstone , local barbarians from Settlestone led by Berkthgar the Bold, reinforcements from Nesme , led by Galen Firth and the Knights of Silver and the mysterious Harpells of Longsaddle . At one point the wizard Alustriel even appeared to deter the attackers. After a few days of intense fighting, the evil drow and other races were eventually defeated and driven back to their shadowy homes.</p>
<h3>King Gandalug's Return</h3>
<p>During the Battle of Keeper's Dale, Bruenor and the other Companions of the Hall freed Gandalug Battlehammer from a powerful spell leaving the ancient dwarf a servant of Baenre. In 1362 DR , Bruenor abdicated his throne to Gandalug, the founder of Mithral Hall, making him the 1st and 9th King of Mithral Hall. The old dwarf died only a few years later, no doubt from old age, as the spell that had held him captive and postponed his aging had worn off. Bruenor, who had taken a few hundred of his dwarves back to Icewind Dale, returned to rule as Tenth King of Mithral Hall in 1370 DR .</p>
<h3>Obould's Orc Hordes</h3>
<p>King Obould Many-arrows launched an attack on Mithral Hall in 1370 DR with a huge army of orcs. The staggering army came from the Spine of the World . Over the next few years the fighting continued and various battles and skirmishes between the dwarves and orcs caused huge amounts of destruction and bloodshed on both sides. In 1372 DR the wizard Alustriel stepped in again to defend Mithral Hall.</p>
<h3>Treaty of Garumn's Gorge</h3>
<p>In 1372 DR, Bruenor Battlehammer and Obould signed a peace treaty which ended the bloody war between the two Kingdoms. As the name suggests the treaty was signed at Garumn's Gorge. The treaty still held true as of 1479 DR.</p>
<h2>Mines</h2>
<p>The primary function of Mithral Hall was a mine and a business. Mithral ran in abundance through the mountain, with some veins as thick as a man's arm. Iron was also mined.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Mithral Hall had a close relationship with the other dwarven realms in the Silver Marches , including Citadel Adbar and Citadel Felbarr . When Mithral Hall was reclaimed by King Bruenor, 2,000 dwarves emigrated from Citadel Adbar with the blessing of King Harbromm . Citadel Fellbarr exchanged caravans with Mithral Hall. King Emerus Warcrown signed the Treaty of Garumn's Gorge alongside with King Bruenor.</p>
<p>Mirabar and Mithral Hall had an antagonistic relationship, with Mirabar even sending emissaries to attempt to sabotage Mithral Hall's ore in 1372 DR . In that same year, a number of dwarves from Mirabar, disgusted at their city's contempt for and hostility towards their fellow Delzoun dwarves defected to Mithral Hall.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<h3>Kings</h3>
<p>As of 1486 DR there had been twelve kings (and one queen) of Mithral Hall. Due to the abdication and return of some kings, they were not all different individuals.</p>
<h3>Allies</h3>
<p>Over the years many individuals and groups of many races have stood alongside clan Battlehammer. Some of the most well known include:</p>
<h3>Enemies</h3>
<h2>Song</h2>
<p>Mithral Hall had its own song, capturing the hard-working spirit of the settlement's first occupants.</p>
