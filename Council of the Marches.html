<p>The Council of the Marches was the ruling body of the League of the Silver Marches consisting of the High Lord or Lady, representatives of the six signatory states (known as Peers), the commander of the Argent Legion , the Lord or Lady Protector, and a rotating Member-at-Large appointed by the head of the Council.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Council of the Marches was initially planned to have 12 members, with each participant known as a Peer. Nine of these Peers, the majority, were to be the nine rulers that originally convened with Alustriel Silverhand : Lord Helm Dwarf-Friend , High Mage Taern Hornblade , Axe-Mayor Luorna Gladeshimmer , King Bruenor Battlehammer , Speaker Ychram Peregyn , Elder Jharak Erlshade , Observer Kerrilla Gemstar , King Emerus Warcrown , and King Harbromm . Alongside them sat Old Night Shalara Swordshigh , Lord Warder Jorus Azuremantle , and the Shining Guard, Methrammar Aerasumé . Alustriel herself, having been elected High Lady, was excluded from the count.</p>
<p>By the time of Luruar's public establishment, however, these were narrowed down to only nine seats. Three of the settlements that had participated in the initial conference, Deadsnows , Jalanthar , and Quaervarr , had lost their votes after the rulers of the larger Citadel Adbar , Everlund , and Sundabar voiced their concerns that such villages could have the same influence as their cities. The remaining settlements were considered signatory states, and so each sent a representative to Council meetings, often, but not always, the ruler of the respective settlement. Of these, Elder Jharak was the only one replaced, with Everlund being represented by Kayl Moorwalker . The Shining Guard, still Methrammar as of 1372 DR , also kept their seat, but two new positions were created that differed from the original plan: the Lord or Lady Protector and the Member-at-Large. The first of the pair acted as the representative of all of Luruar's protectorates, giving a voice to those under their protection who nonetheless did not have the power to vote for themselves. Alustriel's desire to uplift even the smallest of their communities earned her this position, though her title as the High Lady overruled it. The final Peer was a rotating position, a seat given to whomever the High Lord or Lady chose. The first Member-at-Large was Shalara, as per Alustriel's wishes, but Lady Arletha Icespear was promised that she would hold the position in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Council of the Marches began as a conference, called for by High Lady Alustriel Silverhand at some time after the destruction of Hellgate Keep , in the late autumn or winter of the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR . The gathered leaders of Sundabar, Quaervarr, Mithral Hall, Jalanthar, Everlund, Deadsnows, Citadel Felbarr, and Citadel Adbar all met with her in Silverymoon , where she wished to discuss the tenuous safety of their settlements. Not only were they all threatened by the hostile humanoids that pervaded the Savage North , but soon they would face a migration of dragons to the Moonlands and the Nether Mountains , if the prophecies of her Spellguard were to be believed. These threats were so terrible that after three days of discussion, they all concluded that individual defenses would be for naught and, instead, that it would be in their common interest to unite as one nation. Given that this would benefit their trade, alongside ensuring their collective safety, it was a unanimously approved decision.</p>
<p>Despite this, chaos soon took over the talks. Three of the conference's members, Helm Dwarf-Friend, Emerus Warcrown, and Harbromm of Citadel Adbar, saw themselves as well-suited to rule the nascent confederation and desired their respective settlements being made the capital, leading to an argument which both Alustriel and Bruenor Battlehammer refused to participate in. Neither outwardly sought the title, even though they had their people's backing. So incensed were the three's quarreling that they continued for a tenday before finally relinquishing, having realized that the only person who they and their settlements could uniformly respect was the one who first brought them all together: Alustriel herself. This was not a decision she would make lightly, however, and so the Bright Lady called for a recess lasting yet another tenday to consider it.</p>
<p>When they all returned to the meeting, she announced her acceptance of their decision. Though she did so cautiously, not wanting to cause an uproar, she simultaneously relinquished her position as the High Mage to ensure that she would not face a conflict of interest. The rest would still rule their distinct settlements, leading to her first demand. She asked, as per their initial discussion, that they all devote a portion of their military strength to defend their new confederation, herself promising 200 of Silverymoon's Knights in Silver , to be led by her thirdborn, Methrammar Aerasumé. It was at this point that she began considering the prospects of a Council of 12 Peers to help advise her endeavours, further aided by the Heralds of Faerûn and their knowledge on the failings of similar alliances in the past.</p>
<p>The Council would be made up by the nine rulers of their nation's settlements, including Silverymoon as their capital, as well as the leader of their united military, and two more members. In Alustriel's mind, these seats would be given to Jorus Azuremantle, as the new leader of the capital's Spellguard, and to Shalara Swordshigh, the head librarian of the Heralds. This was yet to be decided when the gathered leaders all parted ways, agreeing to return to the High Palace when next they were summoned by Alustriel or, if she did not, in half of a year. As of their departure, the gathered leaders were still debating the name of their union, another debate from which Alustriel excused herself. Taern Hornblade, her successor as High Mage, wished to honor her by naming it Alustryl, whilst Quaervarr's Luorna Gladeshimmer instead proposed the Shining Lands. The dwarves preferred the High Lands or even New Delzoun, whereas Shalara instead suggested a name like Luruar, one that would touch on their lands as a whole by dedicating it to their matron deities , Mielikki and Lurue . Alustriel, still impartial, decreed that by the Midsummer of the coming year, they would have a name under which to stand united.</p>
