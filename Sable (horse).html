<p>Sable was a horse belonging to the Moor Eagle clan of Vaasa in the mid-to-late 13 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime after saving the Moor Eagle tribe and building the Granite Tower for them in the Year of the Moat, 1269 DR , Melegaunt Tanthul met and became quite fond of Sable before leaving for his journey to the Anauroch . His fondness for the horse was such that Vala Thorsdotter was familiar with Sable despite the horse having lived in the time of her great-grandfather, Bodvar . Melegaunt was so fond of the horse, in fact, that when Vala and her warriors arrived in Evereska to fulfill her clan's pact with him in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , he was saddened to see the horse was not with them, and had to be reminded that she had died more than 80 years prior. However, Vala introduced him to Sable's descendant, Raven , with whom he became quickly attached.</p>
