<p>The Orgolath Dynasty ruled over the nation of Narfell from −633 DR to −399 DR . It began when the "Demon Twins" Ulthas and Ulthar Orgolath slew the last Nentyarch of the Crell Dynasty , Belevan the Unliving . The Orgolath Dynasty survived for eight nentyarches and less than 300 years when ruling Narfell, but each ruler was bound to the Crown of Narfell with their deaths until 731 DR , when a paladin named Sarshel Elethlim shattered the crown.</p>
