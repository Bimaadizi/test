<p>Crystal flowers were a kind of naturally-occurring mineral formation found in the Underdark that resembled flowers and other living forms.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The flowers were formed from gypsum , halite , or other crystallized minerals that were forced out of a small hole or holes by flowing water. The crystalline formations took on the appearance of a small prismatic or fibrous growth, and were highly prized by Underdark dwellers for their scarcity and beauty. The flowers were used by drow nobility as table decorations for special events, and illithids used them on occasion as a source of salt for seasoning their brain meals.</p>
