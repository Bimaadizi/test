<p>Polton Karrick was a painter of some social standing from the city of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Lady Jannath was one of the patrons of Polton's. She purchased at least one painting from the artist – a still life picture, that Polton was failing to deliver on time. Some time later the same year, Polton Karrick was invited to attend the art show titled "Strange Tides: Self-Portraits from the Sword Coast ," hosted by Lady Jannath in her Lower City estate. However, the lady's butler– Tarhun Mnemonis , was instructed to gently reminder the artist of the delay.</p>
