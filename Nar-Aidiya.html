<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Bonfire ruled the Brotherhood of the True Flame with an iron fist. He did not care if he was liked, so long as he was obeyed. Fear and respect were the tools of his trade. Most of his decisions were made from the Molten Throne in the Infernal Hall of Krak al-Mazhar , the secret fortress of the Brotherhood located deep within the Great Anvil of the Haunted Lands . Nar-Aidiya ordered the destruction of desert oases and the execution of all enemies of the Brotherhood. The fortress was rumored to be protected from genies and other elemental mages alike.</p>
<p>Nar-Aidiya personally instructed promising young flame mages known as the shig'harakhi . In order to keep the fortress secure, he had these students brought to him by magic. Upon completion of their training he placed a geas upon them, preventing them from revealing secrets about the Brotherhood, and magically transported them back into Zakharan society.</p>
<p>When his duties permitted, Nad-Aidiya enjoyed spending time in the mystical Great Garden .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The Bonfire had access to a wide variety of magic items , but prized among his possessions was the beautiful but deadly Incandescent Eye .</p>
