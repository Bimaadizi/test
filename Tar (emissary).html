<p>During the iron crisis of the Sword Coast in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Emissary Tar was tasked with negotiating a new price for iron with Thaldorn Tenhevich and Destus Gurn of the Baldurian branch of the Iron Throne , along with six of their "advisors". The Throne had just been granted rights to iron mines owned by the Merchant's League and Seven Suns Trading Coster . Unbeknownst to Tar and the Grand Dukes , however, many of the members of those mercantile groups had been killed and replaced with doppelgangers .</p>
<p>Emissary Tar did not survive her visit to the Iron Throne headquarters in the Lower City . The meeting was a trap; Tar was slain by agents of Sarevok Anchev and her persona claimed by one of his doppelganger agents. Her body was hidden away in the tower's top floor.</p>
