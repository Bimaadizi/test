<p>Zakharan ogres were found throughout the Land of Fate .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Unlike savage ogres from other lands, Zakharan ogres interacted with the world in many of the same ways that humans , elves , or dwarves did, though they did not have superior crafting skills.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Zakharan ogres disliked magic and saw ogre mages as secretive and sneaky. In their society, only pure breed ogres were seen as civilized, those with purple skin or mixed blood, like the ogrima , were shunned. Zakharan ogres tended to distance themselves from the sinister reputation of the ogrima.</p>
