<p>Tappy Foamstrap was an innkeeper in Blingdenstone in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Tappy was very bored because nothing ever seemed to happen in her inn. If new foreign guests arrived, she was very keen to serve them well.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tappy went to the reclaimed Blingdenstone and reopened the Foaming Mug inn, notorious in the days before the drow invasion of 1371 DR . However, during the demonic crisis in the Underdark , because the city was not yet established (and because of the arrival of the demon lords ), she had very few customers, and even spent months without seeing anyone.</p>
