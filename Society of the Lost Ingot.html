<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Only males born in Athkatla were allowed membership in the Society of the Lost Ingot. All of the club's young members were wealthy merchants who owned trading ships and fleets.

The Society of the Lost Ingot's meetings were dedicated to discussing social gatherings and investment discussions.</p>
