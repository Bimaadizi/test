<p>King Kymer of House Tethyr , known as " the Shade King ", was the eleventh king of the Lions' Dynasty of Tethyr .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>During his reign, Kymer bore the Lion's Sword , one of the Tethyrian swords of state.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Kymer was the illegitimate son of King Alemander II by an elven mistress. He had a younger half-brother, Prince Coram .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kymer was born in the Year of the Parchment Heretical, 1167 DR .</p>
<p>When Coram became King Coram IV in 1202 DR , Kymer pretended to adore him. In reality, he wanted to take over the throne. In 1218 DR , he finally worked his treachery by bribing the captain of the king's guard to assassinate the entire royal family in their beds. Only Prince Haedrak II , who was in Zakhara at the time, survived the murder. Kymer then set himself up as king.</p>
<p>When Prince Haedrak learned what had happened years later, he resorted to piracy to weaken his half-uncle's navy while buying his time and building strength. After five years, in 1227 DR , he finally led a flotilla against Zazesspur and the palace. The battle ended in a dual between the Shade King and the "Corsair Prince", Kymer wielding the Lion's Sword and Haedrak fighting with the Sword of Starlight . Haedrak was victorious and slew the usurper king, taking the throne in Kymer's place.</p>
