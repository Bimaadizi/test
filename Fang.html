<p>The Fang was a large promontory extending north into the Sea of Fallen Stars from Aglarond .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It was a mostly barren and rocky piece of land that jutted out from the northern coast of Aglarond, marking the beginning of the Sea of Dlurg . The area was battered by storms almost constantly, and seas were often violent. Reefs surrounded the coastline.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The Fangers ruled themselves, wanting nothing to do with the Royal Council of Aglarond , but were still considered Aglarondan citizens.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Fang came to prominence in history after the humans of Velprin were defeated by the half-elves of the Yuirwood in the 1060s by Dalereckoning . While the majority of the defeated humans who rejected half-elven rule would soon found Altumbel , a few hundred went north instead to settle the Fang.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>"Fangers" was a derogatory term given to the human inhabitants of the Fang. The vast majority of them were descendents of the wave of migrants from the fall of Velprin. Sea elves had several villages among the coastal reefs.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Rumors and Legends</h2>
<p>Some of the younger Fangers had allegedly begun expressing a desire to reject their countrymen's disdain of wider Aglarond in 1368 DR , which both gladdened and worried the Simbul as she was concerned that their efforts may have stirred up the older generations against the region's half-elves.</p>
