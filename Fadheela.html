<p>Fadheela was the daughter of Mas'ud , a healer from Al Qahera in Raurin as of 1374Â DR . She wore a blue caftan. Fadheela volunteered her father's guestroom for Thormud Horn after Kiril Duskmourn was allowed into the elven enclave. She also helped Kiril introduce herself to the village, and got her sharing the story of her trip, despite the traveler's surliness. She was taken aback when Prince Monolith appeared later during Kiril's sendoff, though she didn't get a chance to talk about it.</p>
