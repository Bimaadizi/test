<p>Cadogen was a Netherese thief who worked as an Underchief at Constabulary Branch Three in Eileanar before its destruction in 3520 NY (−339 DR) .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Cadogen aided Chief Constable Emblemat alongside Underchiefs Goddard and Morian as they collectively managed the lower-ranked constables.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Cadogen originated from the Unity region, and worked as a thief and robber from his teenage years onwards. Up till his 30th birthday, he robbed caravans when they stopped for the night, culminating in stealing a 35 pounds (16 kilograms) brick of gold that had been destined for the Netheril Mint at Eileanar. He was finally spotted for the first time as he attempted to escape with the prize, but managed to escape after dropping the brick.</p>
<p>Cadogen had a close call when he was caught burlgarizing Chanragoupta , and set to be hanged to death at dawn. Instead, the clever thief slipped his bonds, seduced Chanragoupta's wife Valleria , and escaped together with her. He sent a false ransom note for 20,000 gp that the fearful husband paid, but Valleria did not reappear. Instead, she and Cadogen married and had two children together, eventually coming to Eileanar and finding work as a constable.</p>
<p>At some point, the roguish Gallissoniere discovered his past, and began blackmailing Cadogen in exchange for information on the constabulary's movements. After three months, Cadogen finally had enough and killed him, claiming that Gallissoniere had pulled a blade and tried to fight his way out of an arrest.</p>
