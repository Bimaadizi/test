<p>Aratons , more commonly known as desert devils , were devils surrounded by an unending sandstorm.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Aratons typically appeared as 6‑foot-tall (1.8‑meter), naked humanoids around 190 pounds (86 kilograms). Their forms seemed flayed and sand-blasted and constantly oozed blood, giving them an appearance that often saw them mistaken for undead . This was the result of the 10‑foot-wide (3‑meter) radius halo of swirling, abrasive sand that surrounded them wherever they went; the howling of the sand heralded an araton's approach.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like most devils, aratons were impervious to fire , and had some level of spell resistance and regeneration , (powerful enough in their case to regrow lost limbs and even instantly re-attach them by holding them against their stump). In addition, the abrasive grit that surrounded them harmed any creature that went within it. They were not exempt from its effects, and in fact the only reason they were alive, if gruesomely wounded, was because of their constant regeneration.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Aratons typically fought by whirling their pair of scimitars , each tinged red from the blood that oozed from their bodies.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Native to the Nine Hells , desert devils were solitary creatures to whom the wastes called.</p>
<h3>Language</h3>
<p>Aratons typically knew how to speak both Common and the Infernal language .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1375 DR , aratons could be found wandering outside the ruins of Oreme in Anauroch .</p>
