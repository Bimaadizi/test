<p>A lamp was a basic illuminating device suited for indoors.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Typical lamps consisted of a fuel reservoir (typically oil ) and a wick to burn the fuel. Since the flame was unprotected, lamps could easily go out in the event of a breeze. They were also more difficult to carry than lanterns . For those reasons, lamps were more suitable for indoor illumination. They shed light as long as the supply of fuel lasted, typically 6 hours for 1 pint (473 ml) of oil.</p>
<p>Different types of crafted lamps were available for purchase through Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue .</p>
