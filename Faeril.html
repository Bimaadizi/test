<p>In 1369 DR , Faeril, alongside a fellow cleric of Mystra Beriand joined the expedition to Myth Drannor, along with other adventurers who answered Elminster's call for aid against the Cult of the Dragon that planned to use the ruins' mythals and the Pools of Radiance to conquer the region.</p>
<p>Faeril's group was ambushed by orcs and a fire-breathing creature who slaughtered most of the adventurers. Thankfully, Faeril managed to drag the bling cellar away from danger. Together, the two survivors found shelter in Stillwater Ruins , behind the protection of an elven word of power . Faeril kept the blind cleric safe with her life.</p>
<p>Eventually, a group of adventurers from Phlan , the Veiled Ones , arrived at the ruins to join the forces opposing the cult. The heroes aided the survivors, and after they liberated the shrine of Mystra in Nightingale Court from dark nagas , Faeril joined the heroes in their quest to stop Kya Mordrayn and Pelendralaar .</p>
