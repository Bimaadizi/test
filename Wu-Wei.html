<p>Wu-Wei was once an infamous monk and thief from Shou Lung , who ran a humble tabacco shop in the Western Heartlands many years before the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Wu-Wei was a Shou man with a distinct tattoo of a falcon on his chest. Because of the tattoo, he was given a derogatory nickname—"Chicken".</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>"Chicken" Wu-Wei was born in Shou Lung in Kara-Tur , many years before the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR . His father was a gambler and an abusive drunkard who beat Wu-Wei's mother and only sister to death. Eventually, "Chicken" Wu-Wei gained infamy as a thief. His biggest achievement was when the thief infiltrated the Hojori Temple in Kozakura , the Kumo clan's base. Wu-Wei got away with the clan's treasures, including the famous spy's enchanted quarterstaff called Ryomaru's Harmless Staff . The burglary was quickly discovered, and the Kumo assassins pursued the thief to his home in Shou Lung. Wu-Wei was forced to cross the Eastern Ocean and settle in the Western Heartlands of Faerûn . But the Kumo clan continued the pursuit. It sent three more assassins after "Chicken". One was to find and kill the original group of assassins as punishment for their failure. The second pursued Wu-Wei across the seas. The third assassin was tasked with torturing and assassinating Wu-Wei's every remaining relative.</p>
<p>"Chicken" Wu-Wei knew that his drunkard father would be killed, and that thought brought a smile to his face on occasion. Settled in anonymity, the ex-thief ran a humble tobacco shop until his death of old age. Now known as the Daring Chicken, he sold every piece of the stolen Kumo treasure, including Ryomaru's Harmless Staff . He died old and happy. When the assassins at last found Wu-Wei, there was nothing left of the man but a tombstone.</p>
