<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Lugarrio worked under ranking Zhents Roah Moonglow and Friol , forging sticky alliances with the Guild and the Cult of the Absolute alike. The Guild began suffering losses at the hands of the Stone Lord , so Nine-Fingers Keene rolled dice and hired Zhentarim agents as muscle. Lugarrio was among the Zhents stationed within the Guild's Guildhall in the city's Undercellar . Nine-Fingers, however, did not know that Roah and Friol planned a betrayal. Taking out the Guild meant establishing a Zhentish presence in Baldur's Gate. With the city shuddering under the cult's attack, the struggle's outcome and Lugarrio's fate remained unconfirmed.</p>
