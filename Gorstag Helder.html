Pursued through the streets by the cultists and their wyvern and zombie minions, Gorstag was saved by his fencing master, Taegan Nightwind , who defeated the attackers. Gorstag soon died of his injuries, but not before giving Taegan the stolen documents and warning him about the dangers posed by Sammaster and the Cult.</p>
