<p>Gauntlets of dexterity were a set of gauntlets that increased the wearer's dexterity.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These magic gauntlets looked like a standard pair of leather gauntlets, but when worn, magically fit to the perfect size for the wearer. They radiated magic, and thus could only be discovered by detecting magic or similar means.</p>
<p>The less dexterous the wearer was, the better the gauntlets functioned. They also allowed the wearer to pick locks or pickpocket others; if the wearer was already versed in these skills, they would become more proficient at them.</p>
