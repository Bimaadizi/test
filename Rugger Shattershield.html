<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , shortly before the armies of the Cult of the Absolute attacked the city of Baldur's Gate, Lord Rugger Shattershield was a Parliamentarian of the Gate who voted in support of crowning lowborn Lord Enver Gortash as the city's Archduke. Rugger Shattershield was present for Gortash's coronation that took place in the audience hall of Wyrm's Rock . Following the coronation, he proudly supported the Archduke's steen constructs and the safety they brought in face of a looming war. In a conversation with Alia Durinbold , Rugger stated that the steel watchers and the Flaming Fists needed to be in the same chain of command under the same commander â€“ Lord Enver Gortash.</p>
