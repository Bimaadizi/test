<p>Zarr was a mad half-elf mercenary in Undermountain in 1479 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1479 DR, during a job in Dalelands , he saw a strange glyph .</p>
<p>Later, Zarr went ro Waterdeep where he was hired by the young Rutherford Urmbrusk for a rescue mission, to find Quarren Urmbrusk inside Undermountain. However, during the expedition into the dungeon, Zarr saw a glyph very similar to the one in the Dalelands that afflicted his mind. Quickly Zarr turned his blade on a companion and Rutherford disappeared. After killing his companion, the now mad Zarr went in search of an army to lead.</p>
<p>Soon, he met a kobold tribe and in killing their chieftain gained command of them. The kobolds were at war with a nearby goblin tribe but Zarr defeated and absorbed the goblins into his growing army. He gained control of a small section of the dungeon and started to train his troops. He decided to attack all the adventurers arriving from the Yawning Portal and thanks to a bribe to Sanfin Lotte , he gained the information he needed to ambush them.</p>
<p>Zarr was with his advisors studying maps for his campaign when an adventuring party hired to find Rutherford found and defeated him.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Zarr was always obsessed by military and war. However, after seeing the glyph, he believed himself a great war leader destined for great exploits. However, in his megalomania , he believed all his followers were loyal to him. Zarr was full of paranoia and delusions of grandeur. His obsessive personality led him to pluck out Argust Coppernight 's eyes for giving him an insolent look.</p>
