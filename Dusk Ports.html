<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Dusk Ports were located on the western shore of the Dragon Sea.</p>
<h3>Locations</h3>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Although in appearance each port was an independent and self-ruling state, rival to each other and never cooperating in anything, in reality all ports were under the thumb of Orlarrakh, the Green Duchess, who in turn was a vassal of the ruler of Melabrauth .</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>All cities of the Dusk Ports were rivals of those of the Windrise Ports , not only because those cities were also trade ports, and therefore commercial rivals, but also because the Dusk Ports employed pirates , a practice frowned upon in the Windrise Ports.</p>
