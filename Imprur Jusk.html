<p>Imprur Jusk was a rich halfling investor and landlord from Suzail , active before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before the late 14 th century DR, Imprur owned the warehouse where Flar Oldbottle's Nets, Ropes, Cables, Hawsers, and Cords was located on the eastern side of the canal that connected the Basin with the Dragonmere in Suzail. One day Imprur discovered a hidden gate that activated only in the darkness between Flar Oldbottle's Nets and the Red Sunsets Trading Company warehouse to the south. The gate became known as Jusk's Stroll , which he used to quickly move between Suzail's docks and an alley behind the Dragon's Jaws inn. The gate was in nightly use by the halfling to commute to the posh drinking establishments on the Promenade . Imprur's proclivities were so infamous there was a saying in Suzail that one could know where Jusk spent the night because the smell of harbor fish clung to the highcoin girls he fraternized with.</p>
<p>The halfling remained in control of Jusk's Stroll until his death of winter fever sometime before the late 14 th century DR.</p>
