<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ito Yoichi was a retainer of the Ito family who died in the castle's burning in 647 DR . Thanks to an ancient curse and a krakentua 's influence, he did not truly die and instead lingered to haunt the castle as the fourth of the seven weapon masters of the castle. Finally, in 1360 DR, an adventuring party hired by Michimori Uemon to recover the Seven Swords fought and destroyed him.</p>
