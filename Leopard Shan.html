<p>The Leopard Shan , or the Mountain of the Leopard , was a mountain in the Hordelands .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Located east of the Howling Gap , the lone peak of the Leopard Shan stood as a prominent landmark in the Hordelands.</p>
<p>The ruins of an old monastery, Leopard Stupa , founded by monks from Khazari , stood at the base of the peak. The monastery was once the westernmost influence of the Path of Enlightenment , and stood for several centuries, providing shelter to travelers along the Silk Road , only to be abandoned during the war between Solon and Ra-Khati . As of 1359 DR , travelers still used the ruins of the monastery for shelter, and kept them well preserved, often leaving supplies for the next traveler.</p>
<p>An old Sempharan saying “He’s gone east of the leopard” was used to describe people who passed by the mountain while fleeing the country, usually to avoid being arrested.</p>
<p>Though free of monsters, bandits were a known problem in the region.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The mountain was well known for the snow leopards that inhabited the upper portion of its peak.</p>
