<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Kwukgixrin consumed the mind of a powerful human adventurer , it became obsessed with finding the artifact blade called the Harbinger Kin . It sent out its mind flayers to scour the Underdark in the weapon's search as the adventurer hid it before his death. However, the warrior's twin brother recovered Harbinger Kin before Kwukgixrin's thralls were able to find it. The twin brother was strong in his own right and slaughtered Kwukgixrin's thralls and mind flayers before leaving the Underdark.</p>
