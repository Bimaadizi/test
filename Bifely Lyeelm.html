<p>Bifely Lyeelm was the high priestess of Cyric at the temple dedicated to his worship in Mulmaster . She was half-crazed from her incessant scheming, though it had worked out somewhat as she managed to ingratiate herself to High Blade Rassendyll Uoumdolphin .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Previously a worshiper of the deity Bane , Bifely converted to the church of Cyric during the Time of Troubles . When Bane was resurrected, however, she did not forsake her new god. This led to much derision from the Black Lord's clergy in Mulmaster.</p>
