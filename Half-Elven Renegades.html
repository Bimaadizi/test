<p>The Half-Elven Renegades was a name given to a group of half-elf bandits who raided along the Delimbiyr from within the High Forest in northwest Faerûn in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>Debased descendants of the fallen elven realm of Eaerlann (following its collapse in 882 DR ), the majority were half-elves of mostly moon elf extraction, with a significant minority of half-drow , and humans with a significant amount of elven ancestry. They were the products of unions of Eaerlanni elves , drow , and humans in generations past. Estimates of their number ranged from several dozen to around a hundred.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>They were led by "Princess" Tianna Skyflower , the most notorious of the Half-Elven Renegades. Whether she was a true princess or not was unclear; she certainly insisted on being referred to as one, and it was considered possible she was really descended from the Earlanni ruling house.</p>
<p>Tianna's lieutenants were known as "Barons", such as Baron Rudain .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Renegades acted as brigands and raiders, harassing and robbing traders and travelers through the Delimbiyr Vale along the forest's southern fringe. They normally prowled from north of Shining Falls to west of Secomber , but occasionally went as far west as Daggerford and the High Moor .</p>
<p>Their main source of income was ransom demands on those they kidnapped. They kept their demands low and didn't harm their captives so as to make it more likely the ransom would be paid, but if no one paid up, they sold the captives to the Zhentarim as slaves.</p>
<p>Since the freeing of the fey'ri , the Renegades found very well-paying work kidnapping gold elves for them so that the fey'ri could breed the captives with demons to create more of their kind. If Tianna were to find out what the elves were being used for, she would have immediately stopped the trade, so the fey'ri disguised themselves as members of the Arcane Brotherhood and paid for the elves with Earlanni artifacts.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Half-Elven Renegades continued to occupy the old lands of Eaerlann in the High Forest. For their bases, they always chose Earlanni ruins and other sites, owing to their belief or image they were the rightful successors to the kingdom.</p>
<p>Tianna originally made her base and home in the Dire Wood , but later relocated to the edge of the forest, near Shining Falls .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Half-Elven Renegades were an active threat under Princess Tianna Skyflower by 1358 DR .</p>
<p>By 1370 DR , she had shifted her base from the Dire Wood to the forest's edge near Shining Falls, her purpose unknown.</p>
