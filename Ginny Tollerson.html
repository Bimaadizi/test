<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Ginny Tollerson was a happy-go-lucky woman who gladly chatted up new arrivals to Daggerford and eagerly dispensed directions and information about her city.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ginny Tollerson was born in Daggerford and happily lived her whole life there.</p>
<p>In 1372 DR, Ginny greeted the newly arrived adventurers, soon to become the heroes of Daggerford. She directed them to the city's two temples, the marketplace, and recommended the Happy Cow inn over the shady and unruly Black Stone Inn that even the city guards stopped keeping tabs on the seedy establishment and its owner Gildamesh .</p>
