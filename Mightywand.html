<p>A rod of many wands , mightywand , or gonne of many wands was a device capable of triggering a number of wands at the same time.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Usually, a rod of many wands was a mace-like construction with a haft wrapped in leather. The far end was about twice as thick, with three depressions on which wands were to be mounted.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A rod of many wands allowed the wands mounted on it to be activated as one with a long, complex Draconic invocation, at the cost of draining additional charges from all wands.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The War Wizard Belantra in Cormyr used a version that had a full half-dozen wands instead in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , on the night on which Elminster Aumar , the Chosen of Mystra , came to talk to Caladnei . Whatever those wands were, triggering three blasted apart the flagstones from under Elminster's feet, ripped up the ceiling, and generally raised a cloud of dust. One of the wands, whether it was triggered with the three or not, launched a green ray that melted flesh.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Elminster later claimed he'd helped Vangerdahast enspell the device in use by Belantra, and it was annoying to see it wasted in a mightywand of the Lantanna fashion, strongly implying the device resembled a Lantanna gonne of many wands .</p>
