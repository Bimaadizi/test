<p>Quarrelshigh was a fortified gnomish village high in the Troll Mountains of eastern Amn , circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Its population was about 500 gnomes in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Quarrelshigh was located about five miles (eight kilometers) west of the Wailing Dwarf in the northern Troll Mountains of Amn. The settlement sat between three high peaks and was protected all around by a deep ravine.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The primary industry in the village was mining rich veins of mithral and diamond deposits.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Quarrelshigh had extremely strong defenses that had never been breached. Every tunnel was set with a number of deadly traps including rockfalls and portcullises. Some tunnels were decoys filled with nothing but traps. These defenses were tested every summer by trolls and ogres from deeper in the mountains. Only a resident of Quarrelshigh could guide a visitor in or out of the village safely.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This mining village had been in existence since at least the Year of the Hooded Tracker, 870 DR , and probably long before. The mineral resources that supported Quarrelshigh had apparently never been found or exploited by the ancient dwarven kingdom of Shanatar .</p>
