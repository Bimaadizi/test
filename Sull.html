<p>Sulls , also known as floaters , were a species of aerial predator.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A sull had an unusual appearance, resembling a giant flying dinner plate some 20 feet (6.1 meters) in diameter. Its body varied in thickness, from 1 foot (30 centimeters) along the outside rim rising to a round top 3 feet (91 centimeters) in height in the middle. A large mouth 2 feet (61 centimeters) in diameter occupied the center of its underbelly. A ring of special orifices were found on the bottom, running along the outside rim.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Sulls were solitary and secretive creatures.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>A sull remained buoyant by generating lighter-than-air gases, which were stored in the hump in the center of its body. It was able to control its horizontal and vertical movement by expelling the gas. They were vulnerable to strong wind currents and the wakes of larger flying creatures. Sulls were unable to flip themselves.</p>
<p>A sull's primary senses were infravision and scent.</p>
<p>About one in ten sulls had psionic abilities. Such individuals exhibited the minor powers detection of magic empathy , and ESP , as well as the major powers of body control and telepathy .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Sulls were aerial predators and one would attack from above when hungry, diving and slamming its heavy body into a target. It would then drape itself over the target, attacking with its large mouth. During an attack, a sull released a noxious gas from the orifices that ringed its body. The gas was heavy, thick, and caused temporary blindness to those within the gas. If a sull was unable to consume its prey on the ground, it grabbed its meal in its powerful jaws and floated up into the air, to seek a safer location to feast.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<h3>Reproduction</h3>
<p>Sulls were asexual creatures. They reached sexual maturity in six years, at which point their offspring budded on their bodies. Juvenile sulls remained with their parents, living internally within their humps. Once a young sull grew to a diameter of 1 foot (30 centimeters), it was expelled from their its mouth. It remained with its parent until maturity. After a year, a young sull grew to about 5 feet (1.5 meters) in diameter and was able hunt on its own, allowing them to part ways with its parent.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Sulls were nomadic and lived exclusively in the air. They were often found in the Hordelands .</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>Sulls were sentient and had their own unique language, which sounded like clicking and whistling to humanoids . They understood Common and other languages but, due to a lack of vocal cords, were unable to speak it or any other humanoid language. Sulls avoided contact with humanoids, especially ones that could cast magic.</p>
<h3>Usages</h3>
<p>Due to their size and strength, sulls were sought after by spellcasters to be used as aerial mounts . A captive sull was able to learn their master's language very quickly. A captured sull was not domesticated, as they loathed their role as an aerial mount, remaining only because of fear of a spellcaster master using magic to inflict pain on it. Such spellcasters were usually unaware of the fact that sulls were sentient, as a captured sull hid its intelligence as much as possible. A captured sull was constantly seeking a way to escape its bondage.</p>
<p>A psionic sull would only ever serve a master who was true neutral . If treated well, they would even communicate with their master using their psionic telepathy .</p>
