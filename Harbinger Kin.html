<h2>History</h2>
<p>The original Harbinger Kin was an artifact that belonged to a powerful adventurer who delved into the dangers of the Underdark sometime before the late 14 th century DR. When the adventurer fell victim to Kwukgixrin and his mind was consumed, the elder brain became obsessed with finding the artifact sword. It sent out its mind flayers to scour the Underdark in search of the greatsword that was hidden be the adventurer before his death. However, adventurer's twin brother recovered Harbinger Kin before Kwukgixrin's thralls were able to find it. The twin was strong in his own right and slaughtered the elder brain's thralls and its illithids before leaving the Underdark.</p>
<p>More common versions of Harbinger Kin with a simpler +1 enchantment were forged by Master Blacksmith Marrok of Shining Knight Arms and Armor shop of Neverwinter to help the heroes who sought the cure from the dreaded Wailing Death of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Later the same year, more powerful versions were created by Master Blacksmith Barun of Beorunna's Well to help the forces of Neverwinter stand against Lady Aribeth the Betrayer , who led a marching army of Luskan in the deadly but short-lived Neverwinter-Luskan war.</p>
