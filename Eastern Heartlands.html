<p>The Eastern Heartlands , sometimes merely called the Heartlands , was a vast region in central and northern Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Eastern Heartlands comprised various smaller regions, nations and city-states, including the Dragon Coast , Cormyr , Sembia , Cormanthyr , the Dalelands , the southern stretch of the Moonsea , and Vesperin . The humans of the Eastern Heartlands shared a common culture and language.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the Fall of Netheril , the survivors of three eastern Netherese cities, Anauria , Asram , and Hlondath , gradually migrated and settled in what is now the Eastern Heartlands.</p>
<p>War engulfed much of the Eastern Heartlands during the 15 th century DR , when lost flying city of Thultanthar appeared over the Anauroch desert and signaled the return of the Netheril empire. [ page needed ] The conquering Netherese subjugated the nation of Sembia and some of the Dalelands, while engaging in a decades-long war with Cormyr and the renewed city of Myth Drannor that continued until the calamity known as the Second Sundering reshaped all of Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Far-reaching and influential groups operated throughout the cities and rural areas of the Eastern Heartlands, including the Harpers , the Zhentarim , and to a lesser degree the Red Wizards of Thay , colloquially known as the "Red Magic Cult."</p>
<p>Nagas were known to inhabit the Eastern Heartlands.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<h3>Cormanthor</h3>
<p>The great empire of the elves known as Cormanthyr experienced periods of great turmoil and profound glory over the millennia but its dense and beautiful forest remained vital as of the late 15 th century DR. Its forests served as one of the few remaining havens for Faerûnian elves during the Era of Upheaval as many of the Tel-quessir traveled west to their ancestral home of Evermeet .</p>
<h3>Cormyr</h3>
<p>The stalwart kingdom of the Heartlands remained strong and retained its robust wealth after many years of prolonged battle against the Tuigan Horde , a horde of orcs and Grodd goblins led by the elf- dragon Nalavara , and even the returned empire of Netheril . The Cormyrean people took great satisfaction in the prestige and honor their kingdom earned from those from other lands.</p>
<h3>Dalelands</h3>
<p>The Dalelands was a confederation of rural communities and rustic farmsteads situated within and along the southern border of the Cormanthor forest. Its people were hard-working, prideful, and often wanted nothing more than to be left out of the affairs of the larger nations that neighbored their lands.</p>
<h3>Dragon Coast</h3>
<p>The Dragon Coast was an unaligned collective of independent city-states situated along the southwestern shores of the Sea of Fallen Stars. It served as the gateway to western lands of Kara-Tur on the eastern end of the Golden Way ; a place where numerous contrasting cultures came together to trade goods and trade customs.</p>
<h3>Moonsea</h3>
<p>The Moonsea region of north Faerûn was a perilous place of warring city-states that constantly lived under the threat of monstrous invasions from the surrounding lands. While the natural wealth of its lands attracted some of the hardest folks from across the Realms, they often had to deal with extra hardships not always found elsewhere, including xenophobic governments, dictatorial control over the use of magic, and the ever-present threat of the Zhentarim .</p>
<h3>Sembia</h3>
<p>This young and wealthy nation remained independent for many years before being pulled within the reach of the returned empire of Netheril to the north for nearly a century. Throughout its history Sembian culture was the embodiment of refined metropolitan tastes, envied by many across the Realms. Much of the nation's wealth came from the most influential mercantile organizations that made their home within its cities.</p>
<h3>The Vast</h3>
<p>While the open lands of the Vast were not densely populated, they housed a handful of influential city-states along its coast and many smaller settlements connected by a robust network of roads. A few of these cities banded together to form the nation of Vesperin , attracting traders from nearby nations, and transforming the region into a hub of trade and greater competitive power in the Heartlands.</p>
