<p>Pendro's pawnshop was a ramshackle decaying establishment that stood on the edge of Targos in Icewind Dale in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The pawnshop had a neglected thatched roof, broken apart and missing pieces due to rodent and bird activity. The entire structure appeared unsteady, leaving worrisomely to one side. The shop had a front door and a back entrance, secured by a simple lock.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The interior of Pendro's was just as chaotic and neglected as its exterior. The shop's main room was covered in dust, and its floor-to-ceiling shelves were filled to the brim with mundane household items, miscellany, and mediocre art. A moth -eaten curtain separated the shop's back end from the main room. Some of the more valuable items were displayed in glass displays arranged in a half-moon shape in the pawnshop's main room. Floor planks his a secret lockbox filled with Pendro's earnings and the money he skimmed from the Zhentarim .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Pendro's was robbed at one point in the late 1490s DR , by a down-on-his-luck ex- Harper Edgin Darvis and his accomplice Holga Kilgore . Edgin was forced to sell much of his worldly possessions to survive and feed his newborn child following his wife's death. The robbers took a wide selection of household and kitchen items, a gold and emerald ring that once belonged to Edgin's wife, and they emptied Pendro's lockbox. The ex-Harper knew that the amount of money in the box was likely skimmed off the Black Network. Edgin made sure to drop the rumor of the pawnbroker stealing Zhentish money in a place from where it would eventually reach the Black Network's ears.</p>
<p>Soon after the heist, Pendro's Pawnshop was abandoned by its master, who fled Targos. Subsequently, Pendro's nephew of some other distant relative took over the collapsing shop. It was repaired and turned into a bakery known for its Endevver Buns .</p>
