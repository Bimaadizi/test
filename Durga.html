<p>Durga was the mage proprietor of the Shining Knight Arms & Armor shop located in the City Core of Neverwinter in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Durga was a large half-orcish man with dark greenish hair and dark grey hide.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Durga's Shining Knight was one of the best armories in Neverwinter, thanks to its owner, whose spells helped him to shape metal, and had connections to the dwarves who helped to create quality weapons and armor . In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Durga tried his best to keep the business afloat with the supplies drying out and the city being ravaged by a plague â€“ the Wailing Death . When Durga met customers who looked like they knew value of enchanted stock, he ensorcelled a wardstone that allowed them entrance to the shop's backrooms, where Marrok the dwarf ran his forge. The dwarf knew secrets of strengthening enchanted items and improved magics weaved into weapons and armor with the ingredients provided to him. This service was only available to Durga's special customers.</p>
