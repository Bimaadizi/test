<p>Marcos Flass , or Marcos the Red , was a Red Wizard of Thay and a member of the prominent Flass family, who specialized in golemcraft and creation of gemstone golems used in Thay the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Marcos was a human man with a shaved head, typical for a Red Wizard. His face and scalp were decorated with tattoos .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Marcos Flass's spellbook was bound in red and decorated with a gilded skull. He possessed a sizable collection of enchanted items, including a unique set of plates called Diamond Cut , that he offered as a reward for dealing with a band of Underdark raiders.</p>
<p>He wore a heavily enchanted Master's robe as well as a cape of the fire bath , bracers of armor , with a wand of fire ready to be used on his enemies.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Marcos was a cousin of Dmitra Flass , also known as the Tharchioness and the Princess of Mulmaster .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Marcos was a proud member of the Flass family of Thay when, in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , he shipped a small army of gemstone golems to his cousin, Dmitra, and her husband, High Blade of Mulmaster, as an anniversary gift that was paraded across the city of Mulmaster and delivered to the Thayan embassy for the ruling couple. However, something went awry during the creation, or the constructs were used in a public assassination attempt. The constructs attacked the gathered delegates at the embassy, slaughtering half the guests, but eventually were destroyed. Marcos was blamed for the incident. The Tharchioness did not take the offense lightly and convinced Szass Tam to send her cousin away to the far end of the civilization – Icewind Dale , to Marcos's utter disdain.</p>
<p>Tam tasked Marcos with arranging an agreement between Termalaine 's council and Thay to establish a magical research laboratory in the gem mines. During that time, still in 1373 DR , Marcos got lucky as the Ten-Towns fell victim to various disasters caused by the worshipers of godling Arctus and the man known as Iceblood summoned a supernatural blizzard that curried half the town in snow and forced the citizens to evacuate. The Red Wizard seized the opportunity, as an army of verbeegs moved into the empty town, he went on to develop a new type of construct – tourmaline golems . Little hindered Marcos's research, apart from a band of miscreants led by the duergar called Grimbold Tornhelm , who entered the mines from a passage into the Underdark in the mine's deepest reaches.</p>
<p>When the famed Hero of Neverwinter arrived at Termalaine, opposing Arctus, the Walking Winter, and the mysterious blue-skinned cleric , they confronted Marcos in the mines. The Hero may have had forged an agreement with the Red Wizard to help his research by ending the threat of the Underdark "guests" in exchange for the tourmaline golems' aid in the battle for Targos against the godling's hordes, which was inevitable. It was imperative for the wizard to finish his research as he hoped to pen a letter to his cousin when it was done and beg for her permission to return to Thay. However, the Hero declining to work with the wizard and ending his life was also a possible outcome of the encounter, as Marcos cared not for the fate of the Ten-Towns.</p>
