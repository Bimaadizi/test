<p>Falcon's hunting lodge was the only safe retreat for travelers in the southern reaches of Neverwinter Wood during the late 15 th century DR . It belonged to Gustaf Stellern , who was called Falcon the Hunter. He catered to wealthy people from Neverwinter who were looking for a break from city life. Falcon employed the cook Corwin and the stablehand Pell .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The main lodge was a two-story building with the heads of dead orcs hanging as trophies on the walls of the dining hall. A fortified tower was attached to the main house. Additionally, the compound included a guest house, a connected two-story stable house and smithy, a gatehouse and an outhouse. There were also pens on the hunting lodge grounds for two dozen chickens and a rooster, six pigs, and four goats. In his pantry, Falcon stored enough supplies for an entire season. The whole compound was protected against the forest wildlife by a 10‑foot-high (3‑meter) log palisade. A narrow stone bridge allowed crossing the Neverwinter River at the hunting lodge.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The hunting lodge was located in the south of the Neverwinter Wood , on the east bank of a tributary of the Neverwinter River .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Food and stays in the simple guest house were free but a stay in the deluxe guest room cost 10 gp per night. Falcon also offered his survival skills to anybody in need of a guide.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the appearance of the white dragon Cryovain in the Sword Mountains , Falcon noticed an alliance of orcs from the south and the half-orc anchorites of Talos had gathered in the Woodland Manse not far from his hunting lodge. He reached out to Phandalin to hire some adventurers to make a preemptive strike against them. In retaliation, a band of twenty orcs attacked Falcon's hunting lodge. The anchorites of Talos also conjured Gorthok the Thunder Boar to aid their attack.</p>
