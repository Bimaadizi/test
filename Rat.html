<p>A rat was a long-tailed rodent, a species of animal . Rats with brown fur were favored by the Mulhorandi god Geb , while those with black fur were sacred to Loviatar . Rats of any variety were seen as signs of good omen to worshipers of Beshaba , Talona , and Yurtrus .</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Rats were generally cowardly creatures, but would become fierce if cornered or trapped. They feared fire, but if hungry enough could be driven to ignore this base instinct.</p>
<h2>Species</h2>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Thomas C. Quirkilious of the Chromatic Scale instrument shop in Baldur's Gate experimented with using ratgut to make lute strings. The experiment was a failure, as it proved difficult to process them into strings and the resulting fiber squeaked when played.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Rats thrived in urban environments where they could easily feed off the leftover food and waste of the community. Deep in the Underdark near Menzoberranzan , scurry rats were hunted by riding lizards of the drow .</p>
<p>Beyond the Prime Material plane , rats could be found in the Domains of Dread .</p>
<h3>Summoning</h3>
<p>For those not well-versed in sea-based magics, the summon monster I spell aboard a ship would conjure between 2 and 8 shipboard rats instead of the usual land-bound summoned creatures. A swarm of rats could be summoned with the spell summon swarm .</p>
