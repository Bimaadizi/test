<p>Tulmene was a small settlement on the south coast of the Tethyr Peninsula . Tulmene was known for being the largest fishing village in the region. The village also occasionally traded goods with merchants.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By 1357 DR , Tulmene was one of the few settlements on the Tethyr Peninsula that had escaped attack by the Nelanther pirates. This was due to a secret agreement with the pirates. In exchange for immunity from the pirates, Tulmene regularly provided them with information on the movements of merchant ships in The Race . In order to gather such intelligence, the Tulmene fishing fleet effectively acted as a vast scouting network.</p>
<p>In 1358 DR , an inhabitant of Tulmene named Boltborm witnessed the Red Knight defending Tethyr .</p>
<p>When Queen Zaranda visited Tulmene in Eleasias of 1367 DR , she quickly discovered the pirates operating there. After confronting the mayor and battling the pirates at the docks in a chaotic skirmish, Zaranda appointed the honest guard Jos Knightson as the new mayor. With the pirates gone, law and order was restored. Without the prosperous trade from the pirates, Tulmere saw a drop in wealth and quality of life. This led some inhabitants to resent Queen Zaranda's actions.</p>
<p>By 1370 DR , many of the citizens had grown accustomed to the lawful life of Tulmene, but some still continued to chase dealings with pirates. Jakar Pyllam, Junior (son of the upstanding and honest Jakar Pyllam, Senior ) had reestablished dealings with some of the pirates. Jakar sold at least one tenth of the new ships from his father's shipyard to the pirates. He was able to get away with it by claiming that these ships were "lost at sea" or "captured by pirates" on their maiden voyages when they were in fact already paid for by the pirates in secret. Guildmaster Tormos Ollday also continued to trade with pirates, instead using several front businesses. The mayor of Tulmere himself secretly encouraged connections with the pirates after being blackmailed when his daughter was kidnapped.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Despite Tulmene being home to more experienced sailors, the fishermen of Tulmene and Port Kir fostered a rivalry. This rivalry was adopted by the citizens of the two fishing villages and sometimes led to conflict.</p>
<p>After the destructive battle between the massed forces of Queen Zaranda and the pirates in 1367 DR, two docks and a ship had been razed, due to the use of smoke powder . As a result, smoke powder was thereafter illegal in Tulmene.</p>
<p>The Black Dog of Murtaan haunted the last docking berth on Deadman's Dock. People approaching a ship docked there would hear the snarling of the hound. Continuing to approach would lead the eyes and features of the dog to form until it was able to chase away intruders.</p>
