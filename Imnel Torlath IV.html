<p>King Imnel Torlath IV was an Amnian monarch of the Torlath dynasty, known as the sixth Wizard-King of Amn.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Imnel was the only son of of King Rhadik II . He long outlived most of his family, with his great-grandson Niskam as his heir, skipping his bastard son Rhor .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Increasing monster populations in eastern Amn and financial troubles involving the army led to the Imnel Concession in 1090 DR . The deal sold the lands south of the Tethir Road in exchange for monetary and military aid from Tethyr , partially reversing the Tejarn Purchase of 692 DR handled by King Brinnaq I .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Crested Thrush, 1094 DR , King Imnel was assassinated by agents of the Skeletal Finger thieves' guild as part of a wider pattern of destruction across Amn and Tethyr. Over the following year, the agents of ambitious merchants slew the remaining Torlath heirs while attempting to manipulate the realm, quickly extinguishing the family line.</p>
