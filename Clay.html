<p>Clay was a common naturally-occurring kind of soil in Faerûn and beyond, often used to make useful and beautiful ceramic objects.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Clay resembled thick mud or soft stone depending on how dry it was, and weighed between 112 pounds (50.8 kilograms) and 162 pounds (73.5 kilograms) per 1 cubic foot (28 liters). It was a particularly difficult kind of soil to handle with tools, with even hoes and plows struggling to break through the stiff and heavy mass.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>High-quality raw clay for use in magical spells and rituals was available for purchase through the Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue for 1 gold piece per 1‑pound (0.45‑kilogram). Another variety was available for only 1 silver piece per pound, as well as 1‑inch (2.5‑centimeter) fired spheres for 1 copper piece .</p>
