<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Many members of the City Watch and Nightwatch were quite fond of Davy, due in part to his proclivity for buying off-duty officers ale on festival days.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The past of Davy Jones was largely shrouded in mystery due to him being tight-lipped about it. He was born Reinhold William Rauschpautton in the Year of the Adder, 1328 DR , in some land that was far south of Ravens Bluff. He was the third in line to inherit rule over a minor duchy in that land. He was raised with a courtier's education and trained in the ways of the knight . The eldest of his siblings, desiring no rival claimants to the Dukedom, gave him the ultimatum to be banished or suffer death.</p>
<p>Reinhold traveled around for a time, but came to find that he had little interest in being a roving adventurer . He eventually chose to settle down in anonymity in the city of Ravens Bluff, having his original name known by very few. There he worked as a dock worker for some time and he used the money he earned from that profession, plus his savings, to establish the storage facility Davy Jones' Lock-Up. It was during this time that Reinhold became involved in arcane magic , though he would keep largely private about his being a wizard.</p>
