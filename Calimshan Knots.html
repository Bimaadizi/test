<p>Calimshan Knots was a variety of sweet pastry from Calimshan , baked and sold in the city of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the strife of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , brought on by the Absolute crisis , many businesses within Baldur's Gate that were under the protection of the Guild were faced with increased payment. A certain bakery in the city informed the Guild's bursar, Uktar that it could no longer pay due to the lockdowns and inability to sell goods across the districts of Baldur's Gate. The last payment due was "negotiated" by the Guild's representative, a " half-orc with the sticky fingers," who agreed to take what was due in the form of Calimshan Knots.</p>
