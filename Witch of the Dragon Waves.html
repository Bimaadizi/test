<p>The Witch of the Dragon Waves was a ship sailing the Sea of Fallen Stars in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Witch of the Dragon Waves was a leaky cog .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Harnrim Starangh boarded the Witch of the Dragon Waves as a stowaway while it was docked in Marsember in Cormyr , after his scheme to steal the latest spell devised by Vangerdahast was dashed and thwarted by Elminster Aumar in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR . He used magic to turn himself into one of the ship's ballast stones. At that time, the ship was loaded with pickled beef.</p>
<p>Separately, the ship was boarded by Aumun Tholant Bezrar and Malakar Surth , as passengers rather than stowaways, seeking to go to Yhaunn in Sembia while trying to escape Marsember, as they too had been involved in Starangh's latest scheme. While the two had a disagreement shortly after raising anchors, it was interrupted by the appearance of a dragon matching the description of Aeglyl Dreadclaw .</p>
