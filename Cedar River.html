<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Cedar River originated at two adjacent mountain ranges: first as the North Cedar River flowing northeast from the Orbrekh , and second as the South Cedar River flowing north from the Orsraun Mountains (as of the late 15 th century DR , the South Cedar River was known as the Xian River ). Each of these waterways came together at a point in the forest, before continuing north and emptying out into Starmantle Bay .</p>
