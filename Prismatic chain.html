<p>Prismatic chain was a type of enchanted iron chainmail from the city of Westgate .</p>

The wearer could release pent-up magic once a day from the armor in the form of the color spray spell. Once it was done, the chainmail returned to its drab color. It took a day for the prismatic chain to regain its magics and colors. Additionally, the armor possessed a +2 defensive enchantment.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
