<p>An annihilation doorway was a type of dread doorway whose entrance would utterly destroy any creature that passed through it. The only way to reverse its effect was through divine intervention.</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>Annihilation doorways weren't actual doors, but more the frame of a passageway, often carved in horrifying decor. For example, one could be shaped in the head of a demon with the opening going into it's mouth. This opening acted as a vertical, planar sphere of annihilation , appearing as a pure black void.</p>
