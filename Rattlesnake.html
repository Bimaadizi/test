<p>A rattlesnake was a common variety of viper and poisonous snake , named for a keratin segment at the end of its tail, that produced a loud rattling or buzzing noise when vibrated, to ward off predators.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A rattlesnake could grow to be 5​ to ​6 feet (1.5​ to ​1.8 meters) in length. They had a distinct rectangular pattern to their skin. The rattle at the end of their tails was similar to that of a kamatlan .</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>The disposition of these snakes were once equated by the wizard Elminster with that of a cockatrice . When surprised, they were known to raise their heads and coil them slightly into an 's' shape to prepare for striking.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The venom of a rattlesnake was less dangerous than that of some other snakes. It affected the nervous system, causing a paralysis in the breathing muscles that could lead to death by asphyxiation. The herb jalap protected against their bites and the bent priests of the Azuposi were notably immune to their venom.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Rattlesnakes were typically found in dry and rocky terrains. In Faerûn , they could be found in the land surrounding the Battle of Bones battlefield, as well as in its mountain passes, in parts of the Serpent Hills , and in Emory Wood .</p>
<p>Beyond Faerûn, rattlesnakes could be found in the bleak deserts of Maztica , such as the Pasocada Basin , as well as possibly in Zakhara .</p>
<h3>Usages</h3>
<p>These creatures were hunted by some, both for consumption and for the use of their snakeskin goods such as boots . The pelt of a rattlesnake was often worth around 1 to 4 gold pieces . Their rattles could be used as part of traps , tied to ropes to act an alarm whenever a snare was triggered. In Maztica, their rattles were harvested for use as a material component in the spell snake charm .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Rattlesnakes were symbols of the deities Sseth and Zaltec , who was sometimes described as having two fangs like those of a rattlesnake. And these creatures were among the commonly chosen totem animals for a totemic druid .</p>
