<p>Fengla was a young female svirfneblin of the late 13 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Branded on the skin of Fengla's right forearm was her name and on one of her wrists was a symbol of a pickaxe , the emblem of the bandit Marketh .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1281 DR , Fengla and the rest of her clan were enslaved by the mad wizard Malavon Despana , the bandit Marketh , and their boss Belhifet . At some point during her enslavement, Malavon's insanity drove him to cut out the tongue of Fengla and several of her other kin.</p>
<p>While enslaved, one of Fengla's duties was to bring food to the bandit guards stationed within a watchtower in the southeastern section of the Lower Depths of Dorn's Deep . Often this took the form of apples and wine . When a group of adventurers eventually came that year to put an end to Belhifet's plans, she gifted them the key to this tower and afterwards thanked them for their help in freeing her people.</p>
