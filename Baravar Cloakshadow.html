<p>Baravar Cloakshadow ( pronounced : /ˈ b ɛər ə v ɑːr / BAIR-uh-var ), known as the Sly One , was the neutral good gnome deity of illusion and deception. His dogma primarily concerned the protection of the gnome race through the art of illusion.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Baravar was closely allied with the other non-evil members of the gnome pantheon . His other allies were Azuth , Brandobaris , Clangeddin Silverbeard , Erevan Ilesere , Mystra , Sehanine Moonbow , Tymora , and Vergadain . His chief enemies were the deities of the goblin and kobold races. Other foes were Cyric (for killing his one-time ally, Leira ), Abbathor , Mask , and Urdlen .</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Clerics of Baravar were generally sneaky, smart gnomes, who served their communities by instructing them in disguise and camouflage. They prayed for their spells at dusk, and venerated Baravar in a monthly ritual known as "the Cloaking". The Cloaking was most often held in public places under the new moon, and it was considered a point of honor that outsiders never realized what was happening.</p>
<h3>Temples</h3>
<p>In the Outlands a sprawling, richly decorated and well-staffed temple of Baravar stood within The Lady's Ward of the city of Sigil .</p>
<h3>Noteworthy worshipers</h3>
