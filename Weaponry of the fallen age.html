<p>The weaponry of the fallen age was an array of chaotic magical artifacts found in the ruins of Myth Drannor .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These were high-quality magical equipment made for the elves and their allies, including small , large , and tower shields . The list of weapons included short and long bows ; throwing daggers , hammers , and axes ; bastard , great , short , and long swords ; light and war hammers ; dwarven , great , hand , and battle axes ; great and small clubs ; and great , heavy , and light crossbows , including repeaters ; light and heavy picks ; light and heavy maces ; and daggers , darts , falchions , handwraps , kamas , khopeshes , mauls , morningstars , quarterstaves , rapiers , scimitars , shurikens , and sickles .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Though they individually varied, the weaponry of the fallen age were defined by generally being strongly anarchic and keen . They also shifted to counter and bypass whatever alignment -based protections a creature might have. The thrown weapons retained their returning powers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Forged in the glory days of Myth Drannor at the peak of its power, these artifacts were warped and changed somewhat by the wild magic and other strangeness in the ruins following the Weeping War , unlike the weaponry of the golden age . Though not quite intact, they were highly prized by treasure-hunters and were collected by the antiquarian elves Valanice and Rosella Daventhorn .</p>
