<p>An eversmoking bottle was an item that constantly leaked smoke out, provided the stopper was open.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Typical eversmoking bottles were stoppered bottles made of brass .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Unstoppering the bottle caused a cloud of thick smoke to fill a radius of 60 feet (18 meters) within a few seconds, blocking vision entirely. The cloud expanded as long as the bottle remained open, out to a maximum radius of 120 feet (37 meters) over several minutes. Closing the bottle required the user to speak its command word, after which the smoke dissipated over a few minutes. Strong winds could also dissipate the smoke.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR , the Talona cult of Castle Trinity used an eversmoking bottle in their attempt to destroy the Edificant Library . The cultists placed the Chaos Curse potion inside the bottle, which then steadily released the Curse's maddening fumes .</p>
<p>In the Year of Twelve Warnings, 1494 DR , the nalfeshnee Trantolox kept an eversmoking bottle when attempting to break into the Bleeding Citadel in Avernus .</p>
