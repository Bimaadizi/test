<p>Iomic crystal was a purple crystal found on the island of Ioma in the Nelanther Isles .</p>
<h2>Descriptions</h2>
<p>These crystals came in a variety of shapes and sizes, but largely resembled amethysts in appearance. They had a peculiar structure that made them well-suited for holding and releasing psionic energy , though this was largely unknown.</p>
<h2>Price</h2>
<p>The value of these crystals was comparable to that of quartz .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the Spellplague , the mineral was believed to have anti- magic properties, protecting against the various afflictions and curses brought aboutbby the Spellplague. This led the Amnians occupying Ioma to mine the substance and turn it into amulets to ward off wild magic . It was eventually discovered by reputable scholars and wizards that the iomic crystals actually had no special properties. Despite this, the Amnians continued to mine and sell the stones. Sometimes passing them off as amethysts, and in other cases selling them as bracelets or charms to the poor and less-educated folk of the Realms who were unaware of their status as snake oil.</p>
<p>At some point the Abolethic Sovereignty discovered the psionic properties of iomic crystals and began to conduct experiments with them. One of these involved months of infusing specially-treated groups of Iomic crystals with a variant of the aboleth curse. After much careful testing and refining, they sought a much wider test and stole a large shipment of the crystals that was bound for Athkatla . Once imbued with the aboleth curse, these iomic crystals were sold in Athkatla's low market by a merchant named Ormust .</p>
