<p>Primordial nagas , also known as fire nagas , were a form of mortal naga said to be spawned from the Elemental Chaos .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They had five heads, which were triangular and flat with grotesque faces that looked vaguely like those of older humans with coarse and wicked features. They had forked tongues and yellow eyes, and the impression of eyebrows was given by a hard ridge over their bulbous noses. These features were lit with fire that burned even when they were wet.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>These nagas were aggressive, preferring to fight than parlay in most situations, and the five heads even quarreled amongst each other. They delighted in terrorizing their victims, and found it mesmerizing to watch the fires of whatever they set alight. Unlike many other forms of naga, they were not interested in studying or making plans, and instead relied on their great strength.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Their preferred method of attack was to spit fire at their foes, which they could do from a range of up to 100 feet (30 meters). This was combined with other elemental attacks, such as slamming their enemies with wind or exhaling their freezing breath. Only when such powers were exhausted did they resort to flailing at their foes with their five heads.</p>
<p>Coming within 10 feet (3 meters) of a primordial naga exposed one to a cascade of fire and lightning . The nagas themselves were unaffected by this, and were resistant to several types of elemental magics. Their necks were thinnest and most vulnerable just beneath their chins.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Primordial nagas stood apart from most other nagas, and it was said that their ancestor split from the ancestors of other nagas in mythic history. They were often encountered as guards of portals to the Elemental Chaos or as the protectors of the secrets of powerful primordial entities.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , fire nagas haunted Kork Bay at the narrowest point of the Strait of the Leviathan between the Moonshae Isles of Moray and Gwynneth . Very few survived their attacks, leading to rumors that approaching Moray by this Bay was cursed . One survivor of such attacks was the wereboar , Poke , who lost her boat and crew while trying to leave Moray. Another survivor, Captain Blau , would go on to recount in horror having seen the heads of fire nagas eating the survivors of a flaming shipwreck, and pulling sailors apart between their quarrelling heads. He would drunkenly tell this tale to Captain Lukas , who would go on to lose his ship, the Sphinx , to the same monsters.</p>
