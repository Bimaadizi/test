<table border='1'><tr><th>Type</th><td>River</td></tr><tr><th>Region</th><td>Mulhorand , Thay</td></tr></table><br>
<p>The River of the Dawn lay between the lands of Mulhorand and Thay . Both nations claimed this waterway as their own, and combat between the forces of both sides erupted on occasion.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Though both bordering nations claimed land on the opposite shore of the River of the Dawn, this rapid-flowing waterway followed what is generally accepted as the boundary between Mulhorand and Thay. The river's waters were crossed at only a single point, a bridge constructed as part of the great eastern trading road.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>A single Thayan outpost served to cement the nation's claim on the lands surrounding the River of the Dawn, while military patrols in the region provided a similar claim for Mulhorand. In addition, merchants could often be found traveling along the eastern trading road.</p>
