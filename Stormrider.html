<p>Stormriders were specialty priests of the Church of Talos who exemplified the Destroyer's power through their ability to call natural storms.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>A stormrider's main goal was to cause natural forms of destruction in Talos' name.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Despite the current weather, a stormrider always look disheveled as if they just walked through a violent maelstrom. They were wild individuals who enjoyed destruction to the point of haphazardly running straight toward dangerous situations.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Talos granted stormriders access to several wizard spells that could be cast once per day including gust of wind , whispering wind , and lightning bolt . Once they had gained sufficient favor from Talos a stormrider could attempt to summon a storm or any other weather condition similar to the control weather spell. This could be attempted once per week.</p>
<p>Clear skies and generally beautiful weather had a slightly negative impact on a stormrider's psyche, negatively affecting their abilities during combat, casting spells, etc.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Stormriders wore black clothing and black cloaks . Their holy symbol was worn on a chain around their neck. Their weapon of choice was a special staff made from iron and wood with a silver ball at the end.</p>
