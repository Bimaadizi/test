<p>Bullets of screaming were enchanted sling ammunition that took painfully loud screaming straight to their targets.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Bullets of screaming dealt sonic damage to the target as well as had a 50% chance of silencing them for two minutes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The original bullets of screaming were crated for Jergain Hammerloud , a dwarven warrior famous for his terrifyingly loud battlecries. Jergain felt hopeless and depressed after he suffered an injury and lost his voice. To elevate his spirits, his clan clerics forged bullets of screaming and imbued them with the dwarf's powerful battlecries. This symbolic gesture brought Jergain so much joy that he continued using this enchanted ammunition until the day he died in battle.</p>
<p>By late 14 th century DR , bullets of screaming gained some fame for their potent sonic damage and could be found in some of the Sword Coast 's blacksmith shops as far north as the Ten Towns .</p>
