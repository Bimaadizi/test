<p>The House of Cyric was a temple dedicated to the evil god Cyric that was located in Bezantur , the so-called "City of a Thousand Temples."</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The House was located in central Bezantur, the capital of the tharch of Priador in Thay . It was surrounded by several other temples, the most prominent of which was Loviatar's Manor . Other adjacent temples included those dedicated to Oghma , Sune , Talos , Tempus , Bane , Beshaba , and Tyr .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The House of Cyric was a large complex which included multiple shrines and cathedrals to Cyric as well as dormitories, houses, and facilities catering to the many priests , visitors, and slaves based on the campus. Beneath the complex was an extensive dungeon where the Cyricists performed profane rites. A large mansion on-site served as the home of the House's high priest, and was said to be magnificent enough to have been the royal palace of a small kingdom. This mansion included its own secret underground dungeon chamber for the high priest's personal use.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The House was originally a temple to the god of murder, Bhaal . After that god's death during the Time of Troubles , the temple was converted to worship of the ascended mortal Cyric, who usurped Bhaal's portfolio along with those of Myrkul and Bane . Many worshipers at the temple viewed Cyric as a reborn Bhaal, and worshiped him as such.</p>
<p>With the completion of the House of Iyachtu Xvim in the late 1360s DR, followers of Cyric began to clash with these upstart followers of Iyachtu Xvim , who saw it as their mission to crush the church of Cyric . The two temples launched attacks on each other which included assassinations, magic , and street brawling, often clashing with the city's authorities as well.</p>
<p>Even as Cyric progressively lost influence to rival gods throughout the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , he maintained a strong following in Thay, and the congregation at the House of Cyric remained the largest in the realm.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>As a prominent center of Cyric's worship, the temple likely played host to at least one banelar naga in the years following the death of Bane in the Time of Troubles.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The House of Cyric was home to an army of priests and priestesses of Cyric along with their unwilling servants: hundreds of slaves as well as the risen zombies of their former prisoners sacrificed within the dungeons.</p>
<p>In the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, the high priest was Sharthane Zul .</p>
