<p>Mroarild Sarvarada was a traveling merchant, performer, gemcutter, and the adoptive father of Taline Telgara around the turn of the 10 th century DR.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As a merchant, he sold minor articles of clothing and jewelry; his routine performanced included juggling, dancing, acrobatics, and short comedy stints with his wife. They adopted Taline Telgara , an orphan from near Everlund , after her family was killed by orc raids, and she soon joined their performances. By Taline's second season as a performer, he was adamant they only perform as a family, never alone, and he always had a knife out, on the lookout for admirers of his adoptive daughter. He eventually retired from the road, and became a gemcutter for a coster based in Athkatla together with his wife, Nanath Sarvarada .</p>
