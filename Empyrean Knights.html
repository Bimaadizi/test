<p>The Empyrean Knights were an armed force protecting Stardeep , drawn from the ranks of the star elves of Sildëyuir .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The leader of all the knights in Stardeep was Commander Brathtar until 1375 DR ; the Commander answered only to the Keepers of the Cerulean Sign , specifically, to the one in the Outer Bastion.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Empyrean knights defended Stardeep, followed the orders of the Keepers, and worked on training the next generations of Keepers.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Empyrean Knights had a number of facilities in the Outer Bastion of Stardeep.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1375 DR , the Empyrean Knights were sent to ride out and destroy a wood elf encampment close to the entrance of Stardeep by Keeper Telarian , despite the misgivings of Commander Brathtar. One survivor managed to escape; the Masters of the Yuirwood called an attack on Stardeep afterwards, which the Empyrean Knights were called upon to repel. Three star elves were slain in the attack.</p>
<p>When Kiril Duskmourn returned to Stardeep, some knights were sent out to collect her sword; she refused, and Captain Brathtar directly contravened one of Keeper Telarian's orders. This drove Telarian to kill him, name a replacement, kill the replacement, and then use a trap to cast all the elves coming after him into the Underdungeon . Later, he promoted a knight, Thindhul , to the position of Commander in preparation for a ride through the Underdungeon of Stardeep.</p>
<p>During the ride across the Underdungeon, the Knights discovered a buried city ruin; there, they came into contact with the relic lich , which sent out revived fossils after them. While fighting, they were found and joined by Kiril, who was also looking for them. Kiril helped break the stalemate between the lich and Telarian, who had joined the company in their ride. While they returned to Stardeep, the thief Gage began to follow them too. He managed to knock one of them out and steal his clothes, right before Raidon Kane accessed a teleportation that sent many of them into the Throat of Stardeep.</p>
