<p>Fenerus Stormcastle ( pronounced : /ˈ f ɛ n ɛ r ʌ s / FEN-er-us ) was a retired brigand-turned-spy who operated under the guise of a lamplighter in Waterdeep during the early 1490s DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Beyond his work as a lamplighter, Fenerus spied on Waterdeep for agents of Luskan , who were in fact secret drow operatives of Bregan D'aerthe . He provided information about current political decisions made in Waterdeep to his contacts in the City of Sails.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Fenerus was the founder of the infamous mounted bandit group known as the Blood Hawk Posse . He was ousted as the head of the gang after a failed raid and decided to retire in Waterdeep, where he unknowingly became the primary spy of Bregan D'aerthe.</p>
<p>In 1492 DR , while under pressure from the Lords' Alliance , the Lords of Waterdeep ordered the City Watch to arrest Fenerus for his past crimes.</p>
<p>If Jarlaxle managed to obtain the Stone of Golorr , he entrusted the Stone to Fenerus. He hid the artifact before being arrested but to reveal the location Fenerus wanted to be released and have immunity for his past crimes.</p>
