<p>Misker's Warehouse was a warehouse in the Lower Port of Skullport in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The warehouse was a two-story building in fair condition with an unremarkable exterior. It was the smallest and least imposing of Misker 's three warehouses.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The warehouse housed Misker's most precious goods, including stolen gold coins, gems , jewelry, art objects, and, on occasion, captive individuals.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The first floor appeared entirely empty, save for a stairway leading to the upper level, but it concealed a complex, lethal trap . This trap employed a sophisticated mechanism of weights, counterweights, ropes, pulleys, and dangerously sharp implements. Those unaware of its existence were likely to suffer severe, and potentially fatal, injuries upon entering.</p>
<p>The second floor contained Misker's treasures, secured within locked and heavily trapped iron strongboxes. To further protect these valuables, Misker sometimes employed a basilisk or hired a medusa as a guardian. As a result, he was known to sell realistic stone "statues" to collectorsâ€”figures resembling fighters frozen in mid-action, which may indeed be unfortunate trespassers who met their end by those guarding Misker's contraband.</p>
