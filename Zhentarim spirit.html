<p>Zhentarim spirits were the undead essence of Zhentarim wizards who met terrible ends at the hands of enemies or treacherous rivals.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These semitransparent ghosts resembled spectres , often to the demise for anyone underestimating them as such. A Zhentarim spirit formed a few days after its death and appeared how it did when it was slain.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>These spirits were extremely vengeful, remaining on the Prime Material plane by their sheer will until a specific task was completed or vengeance was achieved. Zhentarim spirits were only created when a powerful wizard was slain. Though they were capable spellcasters in life, a Zhentarim spirit did not have access to the spells it had once memorized.</p>
<p>A Zhentarim spirit would depart the Prime Material plane as soon as its killer was slain. There was no known way to trick a Zhentarim spirit by staging their killer's death.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Zhentarim spirits were not affected by things like holy water that typically had a great impact on the undead, nor could they be turned . Zhentarim spirits could become intangible or invisible whenever they wished, but needed to materialize in order to attack.</p>
<p>A Zhentarim spirit's strike drained the life from a target. This loss of life was permanent to the spirit's killer(s).</p>
<p>They were able to use an ability similar to the magic jar spell and possess others within half a mile. Only one person could be possessed at a time. The spirit needed to relinquish the possession in order to use their draining touch.</p>
<p>A Zhentarim spirit would reform after 100 days unless slain by a wish , finger of death , or power word, kill . With the exception of those three spells, Zhentarim spirits were immune to all other spells except magic missile and protection from evil . Enchanted weapons were needed to harm them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Many believed that the formation of Zhentarim spirits was linked to the magic some Zhentarim wizards used to extend their lives.</p>
