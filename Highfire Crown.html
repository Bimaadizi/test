<p>The Highfire Crown was a priceless elven artifact created during an Elven High Magic ritual that cleansed and constructed the mythal over the Elven Court in 714 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The crown was a ring of thirteen selu'kiira seemingly held together by silver - and amber -colored arcane fire which extended up to seven points.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The Highfire Crown was a major elven artifact of great power. Since the crown was made of the sentient selu'kiira of thirteen high mages , it was a source of near-limitless arcane knowledge. The crown would effectively make its wearer a Grand Mage with access to thirteen supplemental high mages, allowing the wielder to cast nearly any high magic ritual alone.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The selu'kiira belonged to the thirteen Selu'taar that gave their lives to erect the mythal of the Elven Court in 714 DR and bound their sentience to the gems . The crown had no recorded sightings since that day, having vanished in the light of the dawn the next morning.</p>
