<p>Kamus yn Tasyn el Tarshaj was one of the many pashas of Calimport and rulers of Calimshan during its Fifth Age .</p>
<p>Kamus el Tarshaj was remembered in history for his gift of the territory later known as Ankaram to King Silvam Ithal of Tethyr for his assistance in the Eye Tyrant Wars . This occurred in the Year of the Phandar, âˆ’50 DR . On the surface, it appeared an act of generosity, but in reality, the pasha hoped to nullify rumors that Tethyr was planning to conquer all of Calimshan during one of its weakest hours.</p>
