<p>Ualair the Silent was the a High Mage of Myth Drannor in the late 7 th and early 8 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ualair was born in the Year of Shadowed Glances, −110 DR and after 50 DR he decided not to speak anymore outside spellcasting.</p>
<p>Ualair, in the last years of Myth Drannor, was the High Mage of the city and also the Master of the N'Vaelahr , its shadow army.</p>
<p>At the start of the Weeping War , he used a high magic spell to polymorph the gnome Rhymallos into a mezzoloth so he could infiltrate the Army of Darkness as a spy. The gnome sent invaluable information back to Ualair.</p>
<p>He also begrudgingly approved of the Spiders' Truce between the elves of Cormanthyr and the drow of House Dhuurniv .</p>
<p>Tragedy hit Ualair when, in the Year of the Lost Lance, 712 DR , thanks to Rhymallos's information, Malimshaer discovered the Vaults of Uvaeren , a deposit of important elven artifacts. Aulmpiter personally directed Rhymallos's regiment to go to Uvaeren to take the artifacts. Rhymallos immediately informed Ualair but couldn't gather reinforcements in fear that he would expose Rhymallos. Rhymallos and Ualair fought the Army of Darkness's troops alone at Uvaeren until they decided to destroy access to the vault, dying in the process. As one of his last actions to protect the falling city, Ualair broke apart the Wizard's Torc separating the frame and the Starstone , rendering his magical gate , the Circle of Ualair , inactive.</p>
<p>But Ualair survived, severely injured, and entered temporal stasis inside a tomb in Impiltur , where he also brought the comatose Rhymallos. In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Khelben Arunsun located and awakened them in order to gain their help to cleanse part of the High Moor and restore Faer'tel'miir , a lost city of Miyeritar . Ualair and Khelben both gave their lives to fuel the Ritual of Myriad. Ualair's soul then went to Arvandor .</p>
