<p>Vinegar was a processed liquid substance used for culinary purposes, and many others.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Vinegar was mildly acidic and irritating to the touch, and could be distilled to become more concentrated.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Vinegar could generally be found in any shop dealing with food or alcohol. Wine and cider spoiled over time and turned to vinegar, to the disappointment of drinkers.</p>
<p>Aurora's Emporium sold laboratory-grade vinegar for 5 sp per 12 oz (340 g). The catalogue also featured cook's vinegar by the quart, with varieties of aged (1 gp ), blackberry (5 sp), cider (1 sp), malt (3 sp), rose petal (3 gp), and wine vinegar (5 sp).</p>
