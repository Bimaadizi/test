<p>Sharndrel was a male black dragon that lived in the High Moor throughout the 13 th and 14 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Whelm, 1290 DR , when Sharndrel was still young, he and two other dragons were each individually summoned by Ithtaerus Casalia to Dragonspear Castle . The mage created a convoluted plan that involved them killing the defenseless copper dragon Halatathlaer so that he could claim its hoard.</p>
<p>When the dragons arrived, they fought one another and only Sharndrel survived. When he reached Halatathlaer's hoard he saw that Ithtaerus had taken a great share of it and only a small collection of coins remained. Incensed he went to the top of Dragonspear Castle and in effect disintegrated Ithtaerus with his acidic breath.</p>
<p>Sharndrel was still alive as of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR .</p>
