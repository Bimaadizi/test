<p>When the Kalach-Cha came to Shandra Jerro for the first time to ask about the lizardfolk , the lizards managed to burn down her barn. The second time Kalach-Cha came to save Shandra from the githyanki , her house was burned, so she joined the Kalach-Cha. The third time the Kalach-Cha came was due to Ammon Jerro paying respects at the farm for her granddaughter. The Kalach-Cha had to help him defeat one of the demons he held in his Haven. Once finished, Ammon would blast a crate to get a weapon he wanted to give to Shandra.</p>
