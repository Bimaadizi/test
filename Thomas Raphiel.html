<p>Thomas Raphiel was the Lord Regent of Ravens Bluff in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Thomas Raphiel stood 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 meters) tall and weighed 195 pounds (88.5 kilograms). At 67 years, he looked much younger than his true age. He wore fine clothes and always carried a longsword .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Lord Thomas had a noble bearing and was always charming and persuasive. He enjoyed working with foreign dignitaries and could be calm and soothing or forceful and domineering as the need arises. He was very resistant to change and strove to uphold the traditions he was taught. He practiced a chivalrous code of ethics and expected others to behave in similar fashion, but more and more frequently he was disappointed. His one weakness was his pride for his family name and he would not hear anyone slander the honor of the Raphiel clan or he was likely to challenge them to a duel.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thomas was raised for a life of nobility and service, educated in history, literature, and warfare as well as the social graces. His family was an old one with deep-rooted traditions and he claimed his ancestors once governed the lands Ravens Bluff now occupied. He was the head of his clan, which consisted of many uncles, aunts, and cousins. Lord Thomas fought in many military campaigns but never went adventuring. He accepted the position of Lord Regent when the office was left vacant after the death of his uncle Sir Dillard .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He managed the governmental departments associated with the city's economic life, implementing the policies set down by the Council of Lords (of which he was a member). Foreign policy was closely tied to economics and Lord Thomas negotiated commercial treaties with cities and realms in the area of the Dragon Reach and the Vast . His main goal was to persuade the remaining independent lords in the Ravens Bluff area to accept the authority of the city government and promote the benefits of integration.</p>
