<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Daggles was a foppish human man who wore clothes of fine quality and a big feathered beret. He had a light skin tone, hazel eyes, and long brown hair.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , as the Cult of the Absolute menaced the city of Baldur's Gate, the gates between the Lower City of Baldur's Gate and its more affluent Upper City were closed, monitored by the Flaming Fist mercenaries and allowing only the wealthy and current residents of the Upper City through. "Grumpo" Daggles was among the Baldurians who sought passage to the Upper City, suffering through the long lines and rude Fists. He was ready to give up the wait after spending half a day in the queue.</p>
