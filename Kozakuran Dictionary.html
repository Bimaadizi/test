<p>Kozakuran Dictionary was a reference book that listed words and their translation from Kozakuran in the alphabetical order, found the city of Baldur's Gate and printed sometime before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the contents of the Kozakuran Dictionary were considered to be ancient. A copy of the dictionary belonged to the staff of the Szarr Palace in the Lower City . Its master was a Kozakuran vampire Cazador Szarr , who used the Kozakuran language to work sealing magics on the mansion's ballroom doors. Some of the words that were used for this purpose were underlined in the copy of the dictionary used to train the new staff by Chamberlain Antwun Dufay . They were: "open," "enter," "beware," "sealed," and "forbidden."</p>
