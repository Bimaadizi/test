<h2>Power</h2>
<p>When the weapon struck a living opponent, if they did not have the fortitude to resist, there was a chance that some of the opponent's life energy would be drained and transferred to the wielder. This would heal their injuries, but any extra health gained by the wielder disappeared after about an hour.</p>
<h2>Crafting</h2>
