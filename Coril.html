<p>Coril ( pronounced : /ˈ k ɔːr ɪ l / KOR-ill ) was a human wizard and Harper agent in Waterdeep in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Coril was the illegitimate daughter of the rich mercenary lord Sarraver of Baldur's Gate . She ran away from him and went to Waterdeep, where she had settled in her new identity by 1357 DR . Sarraver had no idea as to her location. She was still there through 1368 DR .</p>
<p>However, circa 1372 DR , Sarraver had recently found his wayward daughter. Coril was unwilling to leave Waterdeep to avoid Sarraver's attentions, and so had to stay and reject his agents' growing numbers of attempts to take her back to be married off.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Coril appeared as a young man who was handsome and clean-shaven, with straight brown hair closely cropped and sparkling lime-green eyes. Coril always wore heavy, black robes and carried a heavy metal-bound book under his arm. It was thick with loose papers held in by clamps with the covers kept closed by clasps. It was filled with her notes, codes, and rubbish poetry.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Coril was very quiet, almost to a fault.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Coril was usually found sitting in the corners of the taprooms of the city's inns and taverns (such as the Selûne's Smile ). He seemed to be a people watcher, simply observing all the folk passing by and what went on. In his book, Coril made many notes and sketches, and also wrote terrible poems; some of this was coded information for the Harpers whom she worked for. She made sure to know nothing important about the Harpers. She met her contact, the bard Shalar Simgulphin , in a tavern somewhere in Waterdeep once each month to share what she'd learned, including her notes and sketches. He told her what to look out for until next time, and also provided 50 gp for her living expenses.</p>
<p>Coril would also cast spells for a price and trade copies of spells in exchange for magical items or useful spells he was lacking. He would also tutor fellow mages, but not for free.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Coril's spellbooks were concealed in a secret compartment in Mariners' Hall , in a cavity behind a loose stone in a minaret on the roof. She scaled the wall at nights to get them. Coril possessed no magical items.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Coril knew a wide variety of early cantrips like bluelight , firefinger , giggle , and smokepuff and others, and a dozen minor spells, including comprehend languages , dancing lights , hold portal , shocking grasp , and write .</p>
<p>She was agile and a capable climber.</p>
