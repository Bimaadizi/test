<p>Meryth Heartwood was a spellscarred resident of Helm's Hold and a member of the Heirs of Azure political movement that arose in the city during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Unlike the more extreme followers of the movement, Meryth advocated for peaceful resistance against the anti-spellscared sentiments that were so strong among her fellow citizens.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Meryth held the culture of Illefarn with great reverence, particularly the form of artistry known as song paths , portal networks associated with performances of hours-long poems.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Meryth was a devout believer in the movement led by the half-elf spellscarred Halas , as well as the all-inclusive oration offered by the Prophet Rohini . She was wholly disillusioned when Rohini revealed herself to be the leader of the Ashmadai , and cleansed Halas and many of his followers of their spellscars, in exchange for their devotion to the devil -worshiping Ashmadai .</p>
<p>During the Siege of Helm's Hold , circa the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Meryth joined a resistance group operating at a camp at the edge of the Watcher's Forest . She found comrades among the group, including her fellow elf Dassar Truebow , a hedge wizard named Nottin , and the merchant Kella the Fair-Dealing . She worked with fellow elven adventurers to help recover stolen relics from Illefarn, and prevent the Ashmadai from opening a song paths within the city.</p>
