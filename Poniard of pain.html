<p>The poniard of pain was a magical poniard dagger held by Karissa the Knife , Master Thief of the Night Brigade in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The blade left particularly deep wounds and chilled the victim with a numbing cold, but its true value was in its adaptive nature. It innately targeted the vulnerabilities of those it struck, hitting angels as if evil , demons as if good , fey as if cold iron , werewolves as if silver , and so on. The wounds inflicted by the dagger refused to heal normally.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The poniard was in the possession of the greedy thief Karissa in her lair until she was slain by the Riverside Rats gang.</p>
