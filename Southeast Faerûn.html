<p>Southeast Faerûn lay to the south and east of the grassy plains known as the Shaar , along the shores of the Great Sea opposite the land of Zakhara . At the edge of this region lay in the east the Five Kingdoms of the Utter East and further to the south, and thus beyond Faerûn , the giant peninsula of Zakhara.</p>
<h2>Regions</h2>
<h3>Eastern Shaar</h3>
<p>The great expanse of the Eastern Shaar stretched from the Landrise in south Faerûn to the eastern region known as the Shining Lands , south of the Raurin Desert .</p>
<h3>Shining South</h3>
<p>The Shining Lands comprised the three nations that were nestled around the great bay of the Golden Water . For many Faerûnians , the realms of this region formed the eastern border of their known world, as tales about the lands to the east were too far-fetched to ever be believed.</p>
<p>Beyond the Shining Lands were two more, out-of-the-way Realms.</p>
<h3>Utter East</h3>
<p>The Utter East was a land made famous by tales of fancy that featured the legendary Five Kingdoms and their fantastic exploits. The kingdoms were formed by the Ffolk who had migrated from the Moonshae Isles and conquered the local people known as the Mar , and ruled over them for a number of decades. While the Mar were able to reclaim their freedom, they remained stuck in an imbalance of power with the kingdoms of the Ffolk.</p>
<p>Among the Five Kingdoms were Doegan , Edenvale , Konigheim , and the Free Cities of Parsanic .</p>
