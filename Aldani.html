<p>Aldani , also known as lobster men , or lobsterfolk , were a race of crustacean beings endemic to Chult . They inhabited its many great rivers and lakes, but eventually isolated themselves to the swampy lakes of the Aldani Basin .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>An aldani resembled a lobster , but was the size of a human being. They walked upright on two humanoid legs, but swam like lobsters. Their faces vaguely resembled that of a human, though encased in chitinous armor and their eyes extend upon long stalks.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Despite their appearance, the aldani were highly intelligent and quite civilized race of beings. They generally tried to avoid conflict, thus whenever disputes arose among aldani they would try to settle them with courtly tournaments, though such privilege would not be offered to non-aldani that fell afoul of them. When disturbed by outsiders, an aldani would not resort to violence. Instead they would try their best to frighten them away. Barring that, they would try to bribe the creature into leaving them alone, offering treasures that they had collected.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>When forced to engage in battle, alddani often fought to the death, using their large pincers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to Chultan legend, the Aldani were once a peaceful tribe of fisherfolk, but when they brought all of the lobsters in a river to extinction by over-fishing, this angered the god Ubtao , whose punishment was to turn them into the race of lobsterfolk. The fisherfolk readily accepted their punishment and new state of being. However, they were scorned by the rest of their Aldani tribesmen and cast out into the rivers they had so greedily plundered.</p>
<p>Around 1363 DR , Mainu of Mezro , a bara , dwelt in the River Olung with a dozen aldani guards in her throne room.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR , no reliable witnesses had seen the aldani for over a century, causing most Chultans to believe that the lobster folk had gone extinct. In reality, they had chosen to abandon their homes in the rivers in favor of secluding themselves in the Aldani Basin.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>These creatures once inhabited specific sections of the murky depths of Chults three largest rivers, the River Olung, River Tath , and the River Soshenstar . By the late 15 th century DR, they were primarily found within the Aldani Basin, though they occasionally traveled back out into Chult's rivers.</p>
<p>Alani lived in communities of up to twenty individuals. They almost never left the water, thus few outsiders saw them outside this environment. They strictly patrolled their territory, with patrols accompanied by up to twenty trained piranhas . They also were known to scavenge for various treasures within the rivers and lakes they inhabited.</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>In addition to speaking their own language, the aldani generally understood and spoke Common .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>The aldani were xenophobic creatures, preferring to keep to themselves.</p>
