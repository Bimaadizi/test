<p>Those Who Sleep Below were a group of mysterious and malevolent entities that dwelled in the deep, sunless reaches of the Trench of Lopok in the Inner Sea . They were imprisoned within those depths, ever diligently being watched over by the Triton Protectorates of the Inner Sea, who prevented anyone from accessing the Trench. The tritons were very unforthcoming on the matter, admitting only that they watched against "Those Who Sleep Below" and that their guardianship was some sacred duty. What exactly they were was a mystery to the mortals, with some believing them to be deities , but in actuality they were obyrith lords .</p>
<h2>Notable Members</h2>
<h2>Worship</h2>
<p>Many among the kuo-toa and morkoth believed these entities to be the dark gods of their ancient myths. The early morkoth theocracies in particular believed their gods to be asleep within the Trench of Lopok and that only fervent prayer could one day awaken them. Outside of these beliefs, some legends claimed that the Trench of Lopok was allegedly where both races arose.</p>
<p>They were directly served and worshiped by some krakens and morkoths.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In −1453 TS (−1523 DR) , Kyron the deposed king of Thalorlyn along with his exiled loyalists sought to create a new center of power for himself. Having been driven mad years ago by the whispers of Dagon, he and his loyalists constructed the temple of Vynagyr along the slopes of the Nalaan Plateau and dedicated it to Those Who Sleep Below.</p>
<p>Sometime in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Those Who Sleep Below commanded their devout kraken servant Qol'in'taroq , along with his morkoth ally Vlantir , to take over the abandoned city of Voalidru for unknown reasons. They only specified that they wished to prevent Voalidru's former merfolk citizenry from ever reclaiming it and its many treasures.</p>
