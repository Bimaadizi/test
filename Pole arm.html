<p>Pole arm or polearm was a term for an expansive variety of weaponry that all shared a common trait — the main fighting part of each weapon was mounted on generally a long straight shaft that would be wielded with two hands.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Polearms varied widely in appearance. Their shafts were typically made of either some form of wood or metal. Some had special attachments to topple mounted targets. The main fighting part of polearms were such things as blades, spikes, axeheads , hammerheads , and other attacking implements. They would be mounted on either or both ends of the shaft. They were classified based upon what was the primary attacking implement of a weapon.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>Polearms were relatively easy to wield and granted their users a longer reach, keeping them out of range from melee weaponry with a shorter reach, such as most swords . When wielded by a skilled combatant they could become devastating weapons, with advantages over both axes and swords under many circumstances. The drawblacks of polearms included the space necessary to wield them, their weight, and their overall slowness.</p>
<p>In large groups or armies, polearms allowed their wielders to attack over the shoulders of the foremost or "first rank" attackers. And enabled the commanders of military units to contribute to the fighting while leading from behind.</p>
<p>Polearms were frequently used against mounted opponents. When being charged at in a battle, polearm wielding troops would line up in the front row, stand sideways, and set their pole arm at an upward angle facing the enemy while holding it with both hands. This tactic was known by some as a "wall of polearms."</p>
<p>There were a number of techniques one could learn that were unique to polearms. Such as "sweeping" their enemies, striking all within reach, by whirling their polearm around. "Long striking" by grasping the shaft further down then usual or shortening your grip to fight nearby opponents. And "vaulting," meaning to use them to jump great distances.</p>
<p>Some fighters trained to become specialists in pole arms, becoming what was known as a polearm master or a longarm marshal .</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Generally speaking, polearms were easy to manufacture. Places in the Realms where one could purchase different varieties of polearms included:</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Polearms were a common variety of weapon among the people of Myth Drannor . They were a standard weapon among its army's military elite, including its elite cavalry troops.</p>
<p>In ancient Netheril , most varieties of polearms came into use around 2312 NY (−1547 DR) , with glaives preceding them in 2171 NY (−1688 DR) and halberds coming later in 2584 NY (−1275 DR) . The lance was never employed in that magic-rich empire, as the stirrup never came into use there. Nor was the mancatcher ever employed. Surrounding cultures, however, knew of the lance since circa 1300 NY (−2559 DR) .</p>
<p>Up to the 14 th century DR , polearms were largely unknown to the dwarves of Chult .</p>
<p>In 1350 DR , King Azoun Obarskyer IV of Cormyr published a book on polearms entitled, Treatise on the History of Polearms in Warfare .</p>
<p>Circa 1360 DR , during the First battle of the Golden Way the orc forces of Zhentil Keep were outfitted with a variety of polearms in addition to other weapons.</p>
<p>Some time later in the 14 th century DR, Alusair Obarskyr introduced Earthfast 's ruler Torg mac Cei to the use of polearms, particularly recommending Azoun's treatise on them. Torg would go on to train the soldiers of Earthfast in the use of polearms.</p>
<h2>Polearms in the Realms</h2>
<p>A wide variety of the weapons that could be found throughout the Realms were grouped together under the classification of pole arms:</p>
<h3>Agricultural-Based</h3>
<p>A number of polearms were, or started out as, simple agricultural tools that had been adapted for use in warfare.</p>
<h3>Poleaxe Family</h3>
<p>Poleaxe was a term for any pole arm that had a pole mounted with any combination of axehead, beak, or hammerhead. Axeheads had two basic forms, broad and narrow. Narrow blades were often made thicker to adjust a weapon's weight, allowing the wielder to inflict more damage. The primary purpose of a poleaxe was to chop, though many also had spearheads to provide them some thrusting capability.</p>
<h3>Spear Family</h3>
<p>Spears were one of the earliest types of pole arms, mounted with heads that one could describe as being similar to a dagger . They were primarily used for thrusting, but could also be thrown. Experimentation with different spear heads over time lead to the development of many subtypes or "specialized spears" that had secondary capabilities. Though it should be noted that not all pole arms with spearheads were considered to be a type of spear, only those whose primary function was thrusting.</p>
<p>A subfamily of the spear family of polearms, these were weapons that all had long, curving blades designed for both slashing and thrusting. However, their cutting and thrusting power were not as effective as poleaxes and spear-like polearms respectively.</p>
<h3>Special Cases</h3>
<p>There were a few weapons sometimes considered to be in the same general class as polearms due to their size, despite having designs that would be considered incongruent with what a "true pole arm" was. This included the agricultural tool threshing flail , the weapon derived from it , and the morningstar . The unique dwarven spear-axe known as the urgrosh was another weapon whose polearm status was debated.</p>
<h3>Combination Weapons</h3>
<p>Over time as people sought to improve upon the designs of pole arms, either to mitigate weaknesses or enhance their strengths, a new classification was developed.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>The last broad category of polearms were those that lacked any true classification, specialized weaponry that couldn't fall neatly under any of the aforementioned classifications.</p>
