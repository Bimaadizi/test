<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before 1372 DR, Uzzak-Szalzik and Saslick pledged allegiance to the ancient dragon Thuraskulusk, who protected the tribe from invading outsiders and the opposing lizardfolk under Redeye . Uzzak worshiped the wyrm as a god, while the tribe erected a statue to the dragon at the village's center to be used as a temple. Sometime along the way, the shaman started feuding with an old hag who lived across the swamp from Saslick's tribe. One day, the Green Hag of Lizard Marsh was away from her den picking ripe stinkberries . The shaman sent his servant to steal the hag's hairbrush, which was soon used to craft an effigy of the old witch. Using the poppet, Uzzak-Szalzik started toying with his adversary, sending small curses her way, including covering the Green Hag's skin with red rashes of fire ants ' bites. The witch attempted to retrieve the effigy via an army of swamp toads but lizardfolk fried up the beasts and used them as snacks.</p>
<p>In 1372 DR, Redeye and the Green Hag sent the individual known as the Hero of Daggerford to infiltrate Saslick's tribe in a magical guise as a fellow lizardfolk. The Hero stashed one of Thuraskulusk's stolen eggs in Chieftain Saslick's hut, enraging the tribe's protector. While there, the Hero also stole the hag's effigy , her precious hair comb, and Uzzak-Szalzik's knife . The hag was delighted to have avoided death via a magical poppet and created an effigy of Uzzak-Szalzik using the lizard shaman's tooth from the knife's handle. The hag placed an ironic curse on the dragon-loving shaman, cursing him with a nasty case of dragon lice . Her vengeance was to be slow and deadly.</p>
