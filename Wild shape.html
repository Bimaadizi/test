<p>Wild shape was the magical ability that allowed druids to transform themselves into animals , beasts , and other magnificent creatures found across the Realms and beyond.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Druids could take on their wild shape form twice per day, until they rested their body for a limited time. They could only take on the form of a beast that they had seen in person, or were otherwise familiar with. Once transformed, druids could retain their wild shape form for one or more hours, depending on the power they possessed. They could revert to their natural form at will, a process that was near-instantaneous, or when knocked unconscious or slain.</p>
<p>During their wild shape transformation, druids maintained their natural personality and intellectual characteristics. They acquired the same inherent strength and physical characteristics of their new form, and kept any abilities unique to their race, provided their wild shape form could accommodate them.</p>
<p>While most druids could not cast divine magic while in their wild shape form, the most powerful of their ranks developed the means to do so.</p>
<p>Druids that had achieved some means of undeath could not utilize their ability to wild shape, except in uncommon circumstances that involved tapping into necromantic energies. Two such entities were the misanthropic lich Lossarwyn and the Eldathyn ghost named Hullack .</p>
