<p>The Lord's Keep was a fortification in the town of Llorkh in the Savage Frontier and the seat of power of the town's Lord.</p>
<p>Shortly before 1357 DR , Lord Phintarn "Redblade" was found dead at the foot of the Lord's Keep. Overnight, the mage Geildarr seized the Lord's Keep and claimed the throne, naming himself the new Lord and paving the way for a Zhentarim takeover. He remained installed in the Lord's Keep through 1370 DR .</p>
