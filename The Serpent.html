<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Very little was known about the Serpent, not her appearance nor her race, for she remained behind a gauze or shoji screen when she held meetings with the Phoenix clan. She had four bodyguards close by but rarely glimpsed, while a big vicious hunting dog was the only one to get close to her, with its head resting in her lap. She spoke in a soft and whispery voice. All Phoenix members had met her at least once, but none could recognize her. They could only rumor about her beauty. None knew that she was a hengeyokai , nor that she was also a member of the Black Mist. She walked freely in public, without any disguise, being confident that nobody knew her true appearance.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>It was known that the Serpent was physically powerful, as well as capricious, strong-willed, and without mercy. She also loved dogs.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>In combat, she wielded a katana +3 or a quality-made parang , and had a dozen quality arrows , while she wore leather armor of healing +1 . She was also equipped with a wand of enemy detection and a potion of fire resistance .</p>
