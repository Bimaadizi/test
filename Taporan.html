<p>The town was situated on the long road that extended south from the Huhrong's Road to the Golden Way , at the point where it crossed with the River Tir .</p>

<p>Taporan was well known for the rowdy fishers and rivermen that conducted their business along the River Tir . Passage on a vessel downriver to Ashane cost 1 gp , with an upriver return trip priced at 3 gp .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>The White Dragon and Goblin , and Wolf berserker lodges all maintained alehouses in Taporan. The Wolf lodge house was the largest of the three.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>While the town's rivermen were quite industrious, they were considered brave and even a bit foolhardy among their fellow Rashemaar . They were fond of boisterous singing and excessive drink, though maintained themselves while on the waters.</p>
<p>There were a disproportionate number of berserkers living within Taporan, given its reputation as a fishing community.</p>
