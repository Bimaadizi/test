The pirate was renowned post-mortem for his swashbuckling skills and the circumstances of his death. Grogbeard received a deadly wound after drinking heavily, dueling, and swinging from a ship's mizzenmast. His wound festered, becoming infected, eventually ending his privateering career.</p>
<p>Following Grogbeard the Privateer's death, the Grimace remained in the Nelanther Isles, changing hands several times over the years.</p>
