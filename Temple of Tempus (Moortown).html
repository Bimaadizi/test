<p>The unnamed temple of Tempus in Moortown was a former site of worship dedicated to Tempus , a popular deity in Vaasa . As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , the building lay in ruins.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The building sat in the center of Moortown not far off Dead Man's Walk . It was just north of the Swamphouse Inn .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The temple was made of stone and contained a stone statue of Tempus. It also had a basement accessible via a trapdoor.</p>
<p>By the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, the ruined temple was strewn with rubble, bone, and bits of fur, and the statue had lost its head.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The temple's clerics had maintained a large cache of healing items in the basement, including potions of healing , scrolls of cure critical wounds and cure disease , jars of Keoghtom's ointment , and a rod of resurrection . Much of this was left behind when the temple was abandoned.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the Cult of the Dragon established an outpost in Moortown in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, it became a base for a number of the Cult's dragon allies. Early in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , three red dragons were hatched in the town—offspring of the Cult's allies, Wyndfire and Snizzler —and the temple was turned into a nursery for them. When their parents were away, these wyrmlings were looked after by another red dragon— Flameshoot —and by a human guard named Mristin , whom the hatchlings had been instructed to obey.</p>
<p>The wyrmlings spent much of days quarreling loudly and playing with the head of the temple's Tempus statue. They would wander out of the building to investigate if they smelled an intruder. Much of the Cult of the Dragon prescience in Moortown was oriented toward protecting them, and the Cultists had taken precautions to clear the temple of anything that could threaten them.</p>
