<p>Elyse was an orphaned homeless girl in Ravens Bluff in the late 1350s DR . She had a gift for prophecy.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Appearing to be aged 7 or 8, Elyse had blonde hair and wide blue eyes with an alert expression. Although homeless, she managed to find cleaner, better clothes than others in her situation.</p>

<h2>Activities</h2>

<p>She had a pet cat named Merrylson .</p>
<p>While local Ravenians knew Elyse well and liked her, they were uncomfortable with her because of her habit of saying things they'd rather keep hidden.</p>
<h2>History</h2>

<p>In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Elyse may have begged for money from a group of adventures, and told them a prophecy.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Elyse had a natural but rudimentary talent for psionics , being capable of empathy and precognition , as well as the mind thrust attack mode and the mind blank and thought shield defense modes. However, she couldn't control these, and only manifested them instinctively.</p>
