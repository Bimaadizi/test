<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>A half-dragon had the ability to use the breath weapon of its dragon half, though it was not as potent and could not be used as frequently. Half-dragons had low-light vision and darkvision . They also had tinted skin or scales that were of the same color as their dragon parent and helped protect from physical attacks.</p>
<p>All half-dragons were immune to sleep and paralysis effects. They also had an additional immunity based of which dragon type they were related to.</p>
<h2>Subraces</h2>
<p>Blue half-dragon hobgoblins were the first generation result of mating between the dragons of Morueme and their hobgoblin allies.</p>
