<p>The Siege Malicious was a magical throne that determined the Oinoloth .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, the Siege Malicious was a throne. It was made from the same material as Khin-Oin was made from â€”the backbone of a deity . It was a large and immovable throne intended for superhumanly big people. It was so big that people who were smaller than intended for the throne looked especially ridiculous on it.</p>
<p>It was decorated with inlays of tarnished silver , base copper , and brass, as well as a crown of rubies at the top.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Siege Malicious was used to determine the Oinoloth and give the prospective ruler of Khin-Oin full control over diseases on Oinos .</p>
<p>This was done by a prospective Oinoloth sitting on the throne. If the one sitting had killed the predecessor, the throne accepted him or her as the new Oinoloth but made their skin slough off. With the loss of skin came power over diseases on Oinos, namely the power to create, modify, or nullify any disease.</p>
<p>When a person who did not qualify as the Oinoloth, for example a person who merely drove away but not killed the current Oinoloth, sat on the throne, the throne struck them with a particularly strong version of a disease called gray wasting that eroded the person's force of personality.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1357 DR , an arcanaloth called Yrkhetep tried to usurp Phraxas 's position and the Siege Malicious in a ploy that involved gaining control over the Vilhon Reach .</p>
