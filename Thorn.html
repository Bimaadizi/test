<p>Thorn was a lythari adventurer in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR and a companion of Liriel Baenre and Sharlarra Vendreth . She was a champion of Eilistraee and a Moon Hunter , able to travel along moonbeams.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Thorn was tall and lithe and appeared much like a moon elf , except for the feral light in her amber eyes. She had dark, raven-colored hair left unbound with a single streak of silver-colored hair, which was a mark of the favor of Eilistraee. She preferred to dress in all black colors, the same color as her pelt in wolf form. She often wore leathers and a chain mail vest.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was feral and enjoyed eating fresh (very rare, i.e. , raw) meat. She was mostly stone-faced and calm, however, but acted very straightforward and blunt and could easily be considered rude. As a lone lythari, she had no interest in manners and etiquette, and as an outcast follower of Sel√ªne , she had neither patience nor mercy for her and the goddess's enemies. She also had a very high resistance to pain and torture, never compromising herself in the face of danger or agony.</p>
<p>She had a longing for companionship, being a loner and an outcast from her pack, and thus joined forces with Liriel Baenre in the Rashemi woods.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR , Thorn followed Fyodor of Rashemen and his companion Liriel Baenre to western Faerun and back at the bequest of his grandmother, Zofia , who had promised to send a Moonhunter to retrieve his body if he fell while on his quest. She helped transport Fyodor and Liriel to Rashemen and, once there, helped them defeat a band of drow led by Gorlist that was pursuing Liriel.</p>
<p>Thorn continued to travel with Liriel and Sharlarra Vendreth for at least ten years. In particular, she developed a bantering friendship with Sharlarra. Circa 1371 DR , she was with the two in Hlammach , Impiltur , serving as hired blades for the Impilturan military .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>She used a sword and a bow to fight and was quite skilled. With her sword, she could easily match seasoned drow fighters one-on-one.</p>
<p>She also used some magic that her goddess granted her, such as transforming a ripped lock of her hair in the drow warrior Gorlist's hand into a serpent.</p>
