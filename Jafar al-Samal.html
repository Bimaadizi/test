<p>Jafar al-Samal , also known as Jafar the Incomparable , was the first sha'ir in the land of Zakhara .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in the far distant past, Jafar was able to negotiate with or summon gen , and he gained great magical power from these associations. The lords of the dao , djinn , efreet , and the marids became jealous of his growing power and sent armies to invade Zakhara. In response, Jafar created a powerful relic known as the Seal that subjugated all genies to the will of the (human) Zakharans as long as it was in Jafar's possession.</p>
<p>For the rest of Jafar's lifespan, the people of Zakhara enjoyed a golden age of peace and prosperity. After his death, his students fought over possession of the Seal , causing their gen to unite and rise up against the warring students by stealing the Seal and hiding it where it would never be found.</p>
