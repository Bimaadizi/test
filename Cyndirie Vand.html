<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Cyndirie Vand was a frequent customer of the Elfsong Tavern in the Eastway neighborhood of Baldur's Gate. She could often be found in a large company of friends, including Buff Tanner , occupying one of the large guest tables at the tavern. Like every citizen of the Gate, Cyndirie had strong opinions on the refugee crisis caused by the Cult of the Absolute as well as Lord Enver Gortash . Unlike many other Baldurians, she did not trust Gortash, seeing through his slimy charisma.</p>
