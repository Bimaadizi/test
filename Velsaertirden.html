<p>Velsaertirden was a very old and later greatwyrm steel dragon who lived under several different identities in Faerûn over the centuries. One of the most prominent was as Imbryn Velsaert , a loremaster and sage based in Baldur's Gate on the Sword Coast in the mid-to-late 14 th century and an expert on the dragons of northwest Faerûn , dubbed the "Dragon Sage".</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As Vesaert, living above his small shop in the Temples District of Baldur's Gate, he sold lore and old books on magic , whilst quietly observing human society. From time to time, in one human guise or another, he travelled to investigate the activities of various dragons and dracoliches of note in western Faerûn and find their main lairs. As a result, he became recognized as an expert on these dragons; a merchant of Tharsult by the name of Andlar Verikho , nicknamed him the "Dragon Sage", little knowing how literal this was, and the title stuck.</p>
<p>As Velsaert, he had written of, and indeed commented on, many of the more well-known wyrms of the North , including:</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>His mother was Malavauvrantarandra (Malavauvra), an ailing ancient wyrm , and his father was Phaudrantanthildrar (Phaudron), a withdrawn and focused scholar. Velsaertirden was hatched in the same clutch as his sister Rauvrahrileenatandrar (Rauvrahreene), a ruthless and greedy sort, and his brother Torthalindrarron (Torthal). This was Malavauvra's final clutch, and the other siblings died as hatchlings or within their first year.</p>
<p>He had had many apprentices in his career, and worked with the Harpers of Twilight Hall .</p>
<p>Velsaert was a friend of the bronze dragon Nymmurh, who ostensibly advised him on draconic nature and affairs.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>The Dragon</h3>
<p>Velsaertirden hailed from the continent of Arandron , lying somewhere southwest of Faerûn. He and his clutch-mates hatched within the castle of Steelspires , which had been built by stone giants for his parents. Of the clutch, only Velsaert, Rauvrahreene, and Torthal survived. They grew to become "dragonets", capable of taking human form and switching forms with ease, and explored the neighboring human city of Haunvaerune . For his part, Velsaert was fascinated by humans, finding them entertaining yet dangerous and worthy of study, cooperation, and friendship to see their potential.</p>
<p>But, after one such visit, he came home and discovered his mother and father slain and the castle filled with dragon-slaying traps, and overheard his sister Rauvrahreene openly admitting her guilt to his mortally wounded brother. Shocked and enraged, Velsaert attacked her, but in the chaos of battle, she escaped, injured but alive, while Torthal was obliterated. Afterward, the grieving Velsaert searched the castle, turned Rauvrahreene's traps against her as best he could in case she returned, and abandoned Steelspires forever.</p>
<p>Adopting human form again, Velsaert left for Haunvaerune and boarded the first ship heading far and away for "strange and distant ports". The ship was the Aelusteen , captained by Imbryn Ultal (after whom Velsaert would later name himself), and the port was Sambar in Lantan . Next, Velsaert travelled to the Faerûn mainland, where he stayed and explored its cultures in a variety of human disguises for more than give hundred years.</p>
<h3>The Harpers</h3>
<p>Time and experience saw Velsaert sympathize with the purposes and practices of the Harpers, particularly those at Twilight Hall. Now as Vontur , a human ranger of Zazesspur , he joined the Harpers and worked with them for over sixty years. In that time, he found several references to a dragon he thought could well be Rauvrahreene, but was unable to locate her. He also grew interested in the Chosen of Mystra , and had more successful observing their exploits and attracting their attention in turn. Finally, when caught in a situation from which he could only use his dragon abilities to escape, Velsaert faked Vontur's death, making it appear that a dragon had killed both him and his enemies and flown away.</p>
<p>Becoming Shalant Mornwind , a fearless young woman of Athkatla who volunteered eagerly and for whom no task or company was too unpleasant, Velsaert rejoined the Harpers. Swiftly earning her superiors' trust and respect and taking on greater responsibilities, Shalant was a capable adventurer across west Faerûn . Finally, whilst undercover in Selgaunt in Sembia with fellow Harpers, Shalant uncovered the reason House Morarshar was so wealthy and successful—their matriarch Lady Ambrele was none other than Rauvrahreene in disguise. The two dragons fought, destroying not only Morarshar Hall but several neighboring buildings and much of the street, and causing the deaths of the Morarshars, their employees, and the Harpers in the process. Rauvrahreene escaped once again, badly wounded and this time to another plane . But her spells, meant to slay him, had aged Velsaert by some three hundred years, and he was dismayed by so much death and destruction. So he elected to retire, leaving the adventuring life behind and his Shalant persona to appear among the dead.</p>
<h3>The Dragon Sage</h3>
<p>Adopting a new identity as Imbryn Velsaert, he set up shop as a sage in Baldur's Gate, to sell books and lore and simply watch the world around. But he couldn't stay retired for long. Coming to understand how all kinds of humans were manipulated by churches, cults, and cabals and by beholders , mind flayers , and of course dragons, Velsaert more and more set out in disguise to check up on the deeds of his fellow dragons and dracoliches in western Faerûn. One in particular was Laerahkralan , who interfered in the affairs of state throughout the Shining South via his human and yuan-ti agents. In this capacity, Velsaert also made friends with Nymmurh.</p>
<p>To confirm a story told by the bard Duthchanna of Athkatla , Velsaert and another bard, Schalalla Irdree of the Harpers once went on an expedition to meet the music-loving blue dragon Olothontor , the Minstrel Wyrm. They located his lair near Waterdeep and Schalalla performed for him a series of songs; Velsaert described these as "songs that repeatedly moved me to tears, despite the danger—and more than once did the same, as near as I could tell, to the dragon." Thanks to that, Olothontor let them keep their lives and leave. Schalalla promised she'd come back next season, alone and with a better harp and more songs, and Velsaert believed she did so. Volothamp Geddarm later spoke with Velsaert about the encounter.</p>
<p>In the late 1360s and early 1370s DR , Velsaert was swiftly gaining a reputation as an expert on the lives and times of the dragons of the Sword Coast. It was suggested that Velsaert or another sage of his expertise be consulted on Chardansearavitriol 's disembodied state.</p>
<p>Then, during the Dracorage in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , the Harpers of Twilight Hall sent Baltron Quillfeather to apprentice with Velsaert. Baltron's purpose was to study all that was known about the Dracorage in order to inform his superiors on how to proceed. Unfortunately, Velsaertirden had himself succumbed to the Dracorage and, irritated by his incessant questions, he transformed and attacked Baltron with his claws. Velsaert was known to still be alive after the Rage of Dragons. Baltron's status, however, is less clear.</p>
<p>In shame and remorse over his actions, Velsaert cut ties with the Harpers. Moreover, he predicted that being the Dragon Sage would attract adventurers, Harpers, and others in increasing numbers. Once again, he moved on, "retiring" Imbryn Velsaert and moving his lodgings around the city, first to the Upper City, then to the south, then disappearing altogether. Just as he did, a band of mages and creatures disguised as human came looking for him one night, invading his lodgings and, when they found him absent, settling for slaying his neighbors. Velsaert, who was still in the city but had been laying atop a roof nearby to watch comets at the time, hunted the perpetrators down over the next month and sought their hidden master, whom Velsaert suspected to be Rauvrahreene. But after he'd caught and killed several of them, the remainder hunted for him in return. Thus, Velsaert once again took a new name, took a new form, and took off for new lands.</p>
<p>He survived into the late 15 th century, achieving the status of greatwyrm. But so too, perhaps, did Rauvrahreene.</p>
