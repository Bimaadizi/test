<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was an apprentice at Blackstaff Tower .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369Â DR , one evening in which Briion was duty apprentice, Laeral Silverhand returned to the tower and asked him to burn the clothes she wore. While handling her discarded gaudy, torn robes, he noticed the smell of feline fur and viper poison, prompting him to wonder out loud where Laeral had been; she claimed she'd been kissing serpents, and asked him to tell no one about her escapade.</p>
<p>Later, he noticed the scrying orb watching over her casting room going dark. He deemed it to be her not wanting to be observed; however, as he turned around, the orb exploded, throwing him off his chair. He fainted.</p>
