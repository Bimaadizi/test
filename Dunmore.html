<p>Dunmore was the progenitor of the wood giant race.</p>
<h2>Relatives</h2>
<p>Dunmore was the son of Ulutiu and Othea , although Annam All-Father believed that Dunmore was his son until Othea's adultery was revealed to him. Dunmore had three other full brothers, each the progenitor of the other three main giant-kin races—the firbolgs , the verbeegs , and the fomorians . His half-brothers were Lanaxis , Vilmos , Nicias , Masud , Ottar , Obadai , Ruk , Arno and Julian , and Hartkiller , who was the last born.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Like his half-brothers, Dunmore was born sometime around −30,000 DR . Dunmore's descendants became the voadkyn of later millennia. The voadkyn noticed that Annam had never granted Dunmore the forests of Faerûn , as he had granted territory to his other terrestrial sons, so they claimed the forests for themselves some 4,000 years or so before the establishment of the Standing Stone .</p>
<p>Thousands of years later, one of the very first stormazîn discovered the fact that Dunmore was not a son of Annam. His wife had tricked Annam into believing that he was the father, so that she could have a spy among the Jotunbrud .</p>
<p>After Ulutiu's amulet caused the Great Glacier and the Endless Ice Sea to form, the brothers collectively discovered a way to halt the amulet's magic; however, they were forbidden from doing so by their mother. Lanaxis, the leader, summoned them together for a meeting in Voninheim and planned to disobey his mother and have them stop the spread of the ice with their combined powers. Lanaxis was shocked when Dunmore refused to go along with the plan and violate their mother's wishes. Lanaxis was forced to modify his plan and instead murdered his mother by poisoning the waters of the Well of Health , but he accidentally poisoned not only Othea but also all of his brothers except Arno and Julian and Dunmore. What became of Dunmore after this is lost to history.</p>
<p>The " true giants " considered Dunmore's descendants to be giant-kin, but the voadkyn themselves saw things differently, believing that Dunmore was indeed a true son of Annam and that the story of his parentage revealed by that early stormazîn was a lie.</p>
