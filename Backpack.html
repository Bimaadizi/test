<p>Backpacks were a mundane form of portable storage.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Backpacks were large sacks that came in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and materials. These included canvas sacks with shoulder straps and woven baskets with a lid and shoulder straps, though the most preferred type of backpack among travelers was the leather backpack.</p>
<p>Leather backpacks had multiple pockets, on either side and a large one in the back, which could all have their contents secured by a top flap with a tie. They typically had wide, padded straps in the front so they could be carried on the shoulders and leave the hands free. In addition, some leather backpacks were waterproof.</p>
<p>Beyond the standard backpacks sold by most merchants, some were known to commission experienced tailors or leatherworkers to construct specially made backpacks.</p>
