<p>The Knights of Synnoria , also known as the Knights of Llewyrr , were a famed cavalry unit of Llewyrr elves that defended the realm of Synnoria on the island of Gwynneth in the Moonshae Isles as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>They were devoted to the defense of Synnoria, its capital city of Chrysalis , and the Llewyrr people, as well as to protecting the fey and primal wonders of broader Sarifal . They were said to be fearless and to never back down.</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>The Knights were elite mounted crusaders who were experts with the lance and the longsword , as well as the longbow and shortbow . They relied more on speed and mobility than heavy armor , and learned to fey step in order to teleport short distances, granting them greater mobility in battle.</p>
<p>Against giant foes, they employed double-bladed axes and large, spit-like polearms .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>They rode white horses and dressed in silver scale armor with pointed helmets and white capes .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Knights of Synnoria counted as allies the fey and primal spirits of Sarifal. While they were not above allying with other groups, such as humans , the Knights generally considered themselves so superior that they expected such allies to thankfully acquiesce to all of their demands without any concessions in return. It was claimed by one former human ally that the Knights would rather lose a war than acknowledge humans as equals. The Knights were also known to maintain a retinue of human slaves , a common practice for the arrogant eladrin within Sarifal.</p>
<p>While the Llewyrr swore fealty to High Lady Ordalf as of the late 15 th century DR, the Knights of Synnoria had become a hotbed of resistance and plots of insurrection against the High Lady by the late 1470s DR. They viewed her as an unhinged tyrant, especially after her son ordered that one of the Knights be put to death out of jealousy. Their desire to see Sarifal's rulers deposed led them to consider alliances with the likes of fomorians and the Winterglen Claw .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In centuries prior, Synnoria was defended by an all-female order of mounted knights known as the Sisters of Synnoria .</p>
<p>By the late 1470s DR, members of the Knights were using the old stronghold of Harrowfast to plot the downfall of High Lady Ordalf of Sarifal, and wished to install her much younger half-sister, Lady Amaranth , on the throne. Their hatred of the ruling family was an open secret: it was known even to the servants of their enemies and rumors abounded across the Moonshae Isles of the faltering support for the High Lady. Lacking a large enough force to capture the capital city of Karador , they attempted to form an alliance alongside nine fomorian tribes from the Underdark led by Lord Ughoth as well as a faction of escaped human slaves and rebels led by Captain Rurik , but this ended in gridlock and violence between the three groups.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The faction's members were exclusively Llewyrr, many of whom had been raised and trained in Chrysalis. They welcomed all skill-sets into their ranks, including the likes of rangers and rogues as well as sorcerers , warlocks , wizards , and bladesingers .</p>
<p>Notable members as of the late 15 th century DR included:</p>
