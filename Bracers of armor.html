<p>Bracers of armor were magical armor pieces for the forearms that protected the wearer with an invisible field of force that acted as a source of armor for his or her whole body.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Most bracers of armor appeared to be a pair of normal bracers .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>They could come in a wide range of power levels, ranging from protection equivalent to the wearing of padded armor to the defensive capabilities of full plate mail . The power of the bracers only manifested if both members of the pair were worn at the same time.</p>
<p>Circa 1372 DR , a good number of the bracers of armor found in the wild around Neverwinter came from an armory of some unknown disbanded militia group.</p>
<p>Some bracers of armor , such as the bracers of the blinding strike , came with additional powers.</p>
<p>By 1369 DR , the Cult of the Dragon was using rare magically enchanted claw bracers that served as weapons and bracers of armor .</p>
