<p>Gramble's Climb was a trade route through the West Galena Mountains . It was the shorter of the two routes connecting Vaasa and the Moonsea , with the other going through Garumn's Climb to the west.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Gramble's Climb crossed the West Galenas just north of Mount Throndar to connect Vaasa to the port city of Hulburg .</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , the trail that passed through the Climb originated on the Vaasan side at the crossroads of Maur-Eturo . From there, it ran south through the Sunderland and then west through the Bleak Steppes of Haatar-Baen along the slopes of the West Galenas before turning south to ascend through the Climb. It arrived in the Moonsea region in the Highfells at the edge of Thar , and followed the Winterspear River south along the Vale Road to Hulburg.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Climb was passable as of the mid–14 th century DR during the reign of Zhengyi the Witch-King in Vaasa, providing a connection between Vaasa and Glister in Thar. Following Zhengyi’s defeat in the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , Gramble's Climb was used by the dwarves of Hillsafar Hall to transport bloodstone and copper to the Moonsea. However, at some point during the late 14 th century or early-to-mid 15 th century DR, Gramble's Climb became unusable.</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, the Warlock Knights of Vaasa sought to establish easier trade with the Moonsea by restoring Gramble's Climb and seizing control of the entire trade route through it. In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , one of their agents galvanized and supplied the Blood Skull orcs to conquer eastern Thar and capture the city of Hulburg for the Knights. While this plan failed when the orcs and their allies were defeated at the Battle of Lendon's Dike , the Knights still cleared the mountain pass of orcs and goblins and their engineers completed the restoration of Gramble's Climb in the spring of the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR , thus granting the isolated realm greater access to the Moonsea and the lands beyond.</p>
