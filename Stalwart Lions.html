<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The members of the Lions remained in Crosswinds Keep, and contributed to its defenses.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The members met when Bran Oakenshire was 24 years old, in a tavern near the docks of Waterdeep . At that time, Syussa Broar was on the run from a bounty hunter of Cormyr , and Elthure Vildenof had turned his back on the Red Wizards of Thay . They initially struck out for Myth Drannor , and while they barely escaped with their lives, they continued to adventure together, eventually becoming regarded as protectors of the heartlands.</p>
<p>The Stalwart Lions founded Crosswinds Keep after one of their members, Bran Oakenshire, proposed to Moala Adrell ; due to the disparity in their lifespans, Bran being a human and Moala an elf , they decided to settle down in the Astral Plane after she was given the mission by Chauntea through a vision.</p>
