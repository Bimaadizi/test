<p>Praung was a powerful and ancient ornate enchanted short sword that belonged to Pelendralaar , a red dracolich in league with the Cult of the Dragon in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Praung possessed a powerful +7 enchantment that greatly increased the blade's damage output and guided the wielder's hand toward the target. The weapon also boosted the wielder's physical strength, slightly increased their reflexes, but greatly decreased their willpower. The weapon's true power, however, was its power to cast the resurrection spell . It held three charges of the said spell.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the cultists who were led by Kya Mordrayn made way into the ruins of the ancient elven city of Myth Drannor to take control of a pool of radiance in the cavern cellars of Castle Cormanthor . Pelendralaar was to be submerged in the magical pool to greatly empower the undead creature; however, both the dracolich and Kya Mordrayn were defeated by the Veiled Ones . The Praung shortsword was recovered from Pelendralaar's corpse.</p>
