<p>Stubbins was a horse belonging to Benelaius , a retired War Wizard , at his cottage outside the town of Ghars in Cormyr in the midâ€“14 th century DR . He was stabled alongside Jenkus .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was huge compared to other horses like Jenkus.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Stubbins was cantankerous and would fight against a saddle and throw anyone who dared ride him, so he could only be harnessed to a carriage. Yet Benelaius declared him "a gentle creature," at least when approached in the right way, and could ride him with ease, despite his corpulence.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On the morning of Eleint 17 , the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , Benelaius's servant Jasper harnessed Stubbins and Jenkus to a carriage and took them into Ghars to pick up the War Wizard Lindavar . On the way back, they stopped when they discovered Dovo 's headless body.</p>
<p>That night, Benelaius secretly took Stubbins to ride into the Vast Swamp and locate the tomb of the long-deceased bandit chieftain Fastred , returning early in the morning. This left Stubbins tired and unexplainedly grubby when Jasper cared for him the following morning. Benelaius rode Stubbins again when he and Jasper returned to the tomb on Eleint 20 .</p>
