<p>Lumbar Grundwall was a timber merchant who operated in the town of Targos in Icewind Dale in the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lumbar was a large and wide red-faced man with an explosive attitude.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Jorun Tamewater , of the Tamewater clan, had a strained and argumentative relationship with Lumbar Grundwall. After a fight in 1312 DR , the two stopped talking with each other.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , the Ten-Towns and the town of Targos were besieged by a goblin army that served the Legion of the Chimera . Lumbar Grundwall offered his services in the construction of the town's defensive palisades in the face of the looming siege. To facilitate this, two local dwarves of the Tamewater clan constructed a crane to lift lumber from the docks to then be pushed across Targos towards the palisades.</p>
<p>On the day the town was attacked by the goblins, Olap Tamewater 's crane broke, much to Lumbar Grundwall's fury and frustration. Because of this, the understaffed merchant was unable to deliver an essential shipment of lumber from Lonelywood for the palisade, threatening Targos's safety.</p>
