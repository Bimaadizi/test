<p>Arik Stillmarsh , better known as the Womford Bat , was a vampire residing in the settlement of Bargewright Inn within the Dessarin Valley in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He appeared to be a young man with sallow skin and dressed well.</p>
<h2>Home</h2>
<p>He was one of a handful of permanent residents of the Old Bargewright inn as of around 1485 DR . He took a corner room on the uppermost floor, where he lived as a recluse. The vampire's coffin, filled with grave dirt, was hidden in the attic above his room, reaching via a concealed hatch in the ceiling of the closet.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The vampire hunted for victims by night, seeking them in the surrounding rural settlements, on the Long Road , and in neighboring Womford . There, he preyed on the poor folk of the village when caught on the streets after dark and was whispered of in fear as the Womford Bat. He was the reason they locked their doors and windows at night.</p>
<p>He had a deal with Nalaskur Thaelond , the Zhentarim spy and innkeeper, agreeing not to prey on the people of Bargewright Inn itself, not its guests, at least without their permission. Nalaskur sometimes had him take care of certain guests he wished to be rid of.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Womford in the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR , after a mann called Darreth disappeared just outside paces outside his home, the Womford Bat was blamed. In fact, he was kidnapped by the Cult of the Crushing Wave .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The common folk of Bargewright Inn rumored, falsely, that Arik was in hiding with the aid of the Zhentarim, after conducting a swindle on some important families of Waterdeep .</p>
