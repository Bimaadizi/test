<p>Hartstrum was a Maestro matchmaker from The Fulfilled Heart agency of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , master smith Gyldro Angleiron of the Rivington General smithy attempted to find a mate using Maestro Hartstrum's agency. Despite Hartstrum's best attempts, The Fulfilled Heart continually failed to find anyone interested in a date. In his letter to the proprietor of Rivington General, Maestro Hartstrum recommended Gyldro to commission a portrait that looked less like a blacksmith and more conventionally attractive. But even without a revised portrait, Hartstrum promised to never stop trying to arrange a date for the gruff melancholic man.</p>
