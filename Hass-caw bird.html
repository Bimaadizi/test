<p>A hass-caw bird was a bird that dwelt in the Marsh of Chelimber .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1374 DR , the lizardfolk Sleyvas claimed that these creatures spoke to him. They apparently told him that the three adventurers, Kromlech Bruenghor , Vahn , and Adrianna , would enter the Marsh of Chelimber. As he later deceived the adventurers, it is possible that his claims were not true.</p>
