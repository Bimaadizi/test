<p>An evermemory ring was a specific type of ring of wizardry that was crafted by an old Amnian wizard .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This type of ring allowed its wearer to cast additional arcane spells each day. Some increased the number of lower-level spells available to a mage, while others offered a lower number of additional high-level spells.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The creator of these rings was rumored to have arcane powers that defied the rules and limitation set by the goddess of magic herself, Mystra . Eventually the "everlasting memory" this mage possessed was revealed to be a hoax, and the source of his magical prowess was revealed to have come from the rings he bore.</p>
