<p>Ildru was one of the Magelords of Athalantar in the early 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>His voice was cold.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Ildru observed that the methods to gain arcane power were only through apprenticeship and experimentation, and took strong notice of that fact.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He had at least one spell that would be best used with a blood sacrifice on a Mystran altar. He also had the power to compel actions out of people, whether through a spell or some other means, and a spell that revealed the arcane potential of other people to him.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Responding to an alarm that Mystra's Temple in Hastarl had been entered despite the locks, Ildru soon arrived at the scene with over a score of armsmen. Invoking magic without casting a spell, presumably by an enchantment of the place, the Magelord had a spell provide illumination, revealing an intruder: the thief Eladar the Dark, secretly prince Elminster Aumar of Athalantar.</p>
<p>After using some enchantment to shackle his will, he magically questioned the thief, determined him to possess a unique connection to sorcery, and became curious. Offering him an apprenticeship, the mage was surprised to learn even under magical duress, the mage was willing to be loyal to the Stag Throne in exchange for being taken up as one. However, cross-examination showed he would never be willingly loyal to the Magelords of Athalantar, which convinced Ildru to kill him, ordering his armsmen spear the thief.</p>
<p>As the thief spoke a death-curse, Ildru suddenly changed his mind; a divine manifestation followed, where the spears were consumed by golden fire. The golden fire then spread to the armsmen and Ildru himself, freezing him mid-spell, while Mystra manifested before the thief.</p>
