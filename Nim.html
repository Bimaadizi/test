The rogue nimblewright was befriended and then recruited by Yalah Gralhund as a servant. It was given a necklace of fireballs and tasked with assassinating the gnome Dalakhar and obtaining the Stone of Golorr , triggering the detonation of a fireball in Trollskull Alley . When informed about those events, the cleric of Gond Valetta decided to strip Nim of all his construction materials.</p>
