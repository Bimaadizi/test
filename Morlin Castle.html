<p>Castle Morlin was the seat of power for the Barony of Steeping Falls until its collapse in the early 5 th century DR . It was named after the vampire known as the Baron of Blood, Artor Morlin .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The castle was located on the side of a hill overlooking the Delimbiyr River .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Beneath the castle was a winding network of dungeons. These remained for over a thousand years after the castle's destruction.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 3 rd century DR, the castle stood at the eastern edge of the Halangorn Forest and its lord claimed the title Lord Protector of the Sword Hills in addition to Baron of Steeping Falls.</p>
<p>After the collapse of the barony, in the Year of the Black Dagger, 403 DR the castle became the lair of horrifying beasts and malevolent undead . Folks from the surrounding areas avoided the ruins of the fallen castle.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Penitent Rogue, 931 DR , the young merchant's son Tyndal famously defended his family from a band of lizardfolk armed with only a dagger , very near the castle's former location. Some 16 years later he founded his own duchy, and began construction of Castle Daggerford directly over its ruins.</p>
