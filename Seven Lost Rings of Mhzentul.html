<p>The Seven Lost Rings of Mhzentul was a set of powerful magical rings crafted by the wizard Mhzentul .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>All the Seven Lost Rings were forged from mithral treated with the dwarven everbright technique to make them shine brightly and immune to rust and corrosion. Although the bands themselves were relatively simple, most of them were engraved with complex runes in an ancient Elven dialect. The precise meaning of the engravings was lost to time, unrecoverable even through legend lore and similar magic.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Each ring had its own discrete set of powers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mhzentul died a fiery death at the Battle of the River Rising in the Year of the Lion, 1340 DR , likely because he reversed the tshala transformation of the ring of the tshala and inadvertently torched himself. Many of the rings seemed to vanish with Mhzentul, their locations mostly unknown or, at best, the subject of colorful rumors. A party of adventurers ransacked Mhzentul's mountain lair but found no trace of them there.</p>
<p>Eventually, the Zhentarim wizard Whisper found some of the Seven Lost Rings and used their power to advance the Zhentish agenda in northern Cormyr . Whisper eventually attracted the ire of Doust Sulwood and the future Knights of Myth Drannor , who tracked the mage to his subterranean lair, Whisper's Crypt , and ended his machinations. Only two of the Seven Lost Rings were recovered, believed to be the ring of burning and the ring of night . Both rings were passed on to the House of the Morning , a Lathanderite temple in Eveningstar .</p>
<p>The other five rings were theorized to remain hidden somewhere in Whisper's Crypt, or possibly the Haunted Halls near Eveningstar, or close to where Mhzentul perished.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>The Seven Lost Rings were considered the most famous of Mhzentul's works, alongside the tome Mhzentul's Runes . Their fame was largely derived from the mystery surrounding their whereabouts following Mhzentul's death.</p>
