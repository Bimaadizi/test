<p>Twinkle was Drizzt Do'Urden 's left-handed defensive scimitar . it was forged by the elves of old.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>It had the powers of a defender +5 scimitar or a +2 defending scimitar .</p>
<p>It was partially empathic and could impart weak, base emotions upon its wielder.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The blade was given to Drizzt by Malchor Harpell in 1356 DR , when the Companions of the Hall were chasing Artemis Entreri after he had kidnapped Regis .</p>
<p>The sword was later broken, and then repaired, but without all of the strong defensive magic it formerly had.</p>
<p>Later on, Catti-brie combined the blade with another sword, Vidrinath , by using the Great Forge of Gauntlgrym . With the help of the primordial guiding her, the act not only restored much of blade's former ability but also greatly improved its cutting edge and defensive power as well. Drizzt noted that the new blade had become superior to the original Twinkle after wielding it in mock combat.</p>
