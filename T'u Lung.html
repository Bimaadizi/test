<p>T'u Lung was an oppressive and politically unstable country in Kara-Tur . After splitting from Shou Lung after a rebellion, the two states were at war for almost 250 years.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>T'u Lung was split into six provinces: Joi Chang Peninsula , Ausa , East Wai , West Wai , Bashan Do , and Fengnao Province . Each province was administered by a hereditary governor and divided into several districts.</p>
<p>A vast range of climates and environments could be found within T'u Lung, including mountains, hills, rivers, lakes and plains.</p>
<h2>Politics</h2>
<h3>Government</h3>
<p>T'u Lung was split into six provinces , each ruled by a hereditary governor . The Emperor of T'u Lung was the overall leader but his power was diminished by the numerous wealthy noble families that controlled the various offices across the country. In order to gain support for his rebellion against the north, Emperor Shin Gisen had given power to the wealthy noble families. However, after T'u Lung was established as its own nation, it became near-impossible for the Emperor to regain this power. Several centuries later, the noble families still held a lot of power to the extent that the Emperor couldn't enforce his edicts without consent from the majority of nobles.</p>
<p>The administration of T'u Lung was largely corrupt and favored only the wealthy. Commoners had almost no chance of rising up into positions of government.</p>
<h3>Foreign Relations</h3>
<p>Although major incursions from Shou Lung ended in Shou Year 2258 (1008 DR) , small skirmishes continued to occur and relations with Shou Lung remained fragile.</p>
<p>T'u Lung had diplomatic relations with Tabot , Wa , and Kozakura . These were set up in Shou Year 2589 (1339 DR) as a response to Shou Lung beginning the " Gathering of Pearls ".</p>
<p>Along the coast of the jungles south of T'u Lung, there were several small city-states that formed alliances with T'u Lung and paid regular tributes.</p>
<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>The most common trade in T'u Lung was farming, which occurred almost everywhere in the country but especially along the banks of the Fenghsintzu river. In the southern hills of T'u Lung, lumbering was more widespread.</p>
<p>Taxation in T'u Lung was strict but many managed to avoid paying each year. Everyone who made money in T'u Lung (including adventurers) was required to pay exactly one third of their income to township officers. Tax evasion could lead to confiscation of all assets and deportation.</p>
<p>T'u Lung minted its own coinage , although the currency used the same values and denominations as the Shou Lung currency. The exchange rate with Shou Lung coins was notoriously bad as away from the border Shou Lung currency had basically no value.</p>
<h2>Demographics</h2>
<h3>Ethnic Groups</h3>
<p>Kara-Tur wasn't home to any indigenous populations of elves , dwarves or other humanoids common in Faerûn . The majority of T'u Lung's population was human, but hengeyokai , korobokuru , and spirit folk were also common.</p>
<p>The majority of humans of T'u Lung shared racial characteristics like epicanthic folds , brown eyes, and fine, straight black hair. T'u Lung people were also known to be slightly taller with thinner cheekbones than the humans in neighboring lands.</p>
<h3>Language</h3>
<p>The most common language spoken in T'u Lung was Kao te Shou , as in Shou Lung. Local accents and dialects of Kao te Shou were numerous and varied greatly across the country. T'u Lung did also have its own unique language, also named T'u Lung , but this was probably not commonly used.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<h3>Events & Festivals</h3>
<p>Once a year, on the fifth day of the month of Yu , the inhabitants of T'u Lung celebrated the Festival to Welcome the Ethers .</p>
<h3>Cuisine</h3>
<p>Rice was by far the most common food in T'u Lung. It was served in some form with every meal. In both Shou Lung and T'u Lung, the most commonly used greeting was " Have you eaten rice today? ". This had the same effect as saying " Hello " in Faerûn and showed how important rice was in daily life. Fish was the most commonly consumed meat and tea the most popular drink.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the Emperor of Shou Lung died before naming an heir, civil war broke out between the north and the south. The northern factions backed Shin Lu , while the southern lords of T'u Lung backed Shin Gisen . Two years later, in 2316 (1066 DR) Shin Gisen was made Emperor of T'u Lung and the nation was officially founded.</p>
<p>In 2366 (1116 DR) , Emperor Shin Rokan tried to remove power from the barons and increase taxes. He was soon assassinated by Wai Long Hwa , who proclaimed himself Emperor. Some of the powerful noble families made alliances and seceded from the Emperor and the period of the "Three Kingdoms" began.</p>
<p>In 2419 (1169 DR) , a potter of Chedoru named Jo He Ting created a set of eight magical bowls for the imperial court. Anyone who ate from the bowls was bestowed with clear thought for an hour after using them. Four years later, in 2424 (1173 DR) , Emperor Wai Chu Doang was killed by poison while using the bowls.</p>
<p>After the death of Wai Lo Yan , one of T'u Lung's most long-lived emperors, the only heir was his daughter Wai Yeh Ying . Tradition meant that she should have been made emperor but the nobles of T'u Lung instead made her regent until Wai Lo Yan's nephew came of age.</p>
<p>After 242 years of conflicts and incursions with Shou Lung, diplomatic overtures were made and major invasions ceased. Despite this, Shou Lung continued to send small forces into T'u Lung on a regular basis, justifying these intrusions as hunting fleeing criminals.</p>
<p>Wai Yong , the young tenth emperor of the Lui Dynasty , secretly visited the western nation of Mulhorand under an assumed identity in 2625 (1375 DR) . The reasons for this journey were unknown.</p>
