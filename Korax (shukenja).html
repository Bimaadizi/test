<p>Korax of Manchar was a human male shukenja and follower of the Way from the town of Manchar in Koryo in the midâ€“14 th century DR . He was a holy man who wandered northern Koryo, and was famous for his kindness.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Korax commonly wandered the lands of northern Silla in Koryo, between Foo Nakar and Koje , doing his holy work. Known for his great kindness, Korax often healed ill and wounded people whom he encountered, but departed before anyone could thank him. Rarely, he even resurrected a fallen warrior, provided they were of lawful good nature and had died in a battle against evil.</p>
<p>King Wanang Sun regularly met with Korax, asking for his sage advice on magic and other matters.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Korax was tall and had long silvery hair, which he tied back with a leather thong. He wore the garb of the common folk of Koryo, namely an all-white work smock. Unusually, however, he belted it with an heavy leather girdle, a wide belt worked with colorful dyes and shimmering threads. He also bore a heavy iron ring on his right index finger.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Korax owned a girdle of stone giant strength and his iron ring let him cast a minor globe of invulnerability once a day. These enchanted items were granted to him by an envoy of the Heavens , in order that he use them to better mankind.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Korax once came across a wounded hare , which turned out to be the hare hengeyokai Xax Chung . However, after healing him, Korax placed a geas on Xax, commanding that he must protect the people of the city of Koje until Jisziat's Tower was cast down. Finally, many years later, Xax died defending Koje from a dragon that tore down Jisziat's Tower.</p>
<p>Around 1357 DR, Korax healed some twenty townsfolk of Koje. Although he did not give his name, the people erected a monument in thanks regardless.</p>
