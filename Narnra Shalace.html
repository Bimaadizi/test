<p>Narnra Shalace was a rogue who called Waterdeep her home.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>She was the daughter of the song dragon Maerjanthra Shalace and Elminster . Her thief name was the Silken Shadow. Narnra was unaware of the fact that her mother was a dragon (Narnra herself appeared entirely human), and thought that she was dead, as her mother staged her own death so that Narnra could come of age without her assistance.</p>
