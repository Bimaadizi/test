<p>Farlin was a member of The Guild crime gang in Baldur's Gate and an Envoy of Nine-Fingers to the Stone Lord in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Farlin was a rock gnome woman with a pale skin tone and green eyes. She wore a leather helmet and leather armor dyed in emerald -greenâ€”the Guild's telltale color. She was armed with two daggers : a mundane one, and an enchanted Gleamdance dagger .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , during the Absolute crisis , Farlin led a gang of Guild members in dealing with the dreaded Stone Lord and his men. The new kingpin secretly served the Absolute and was trying to remove the Guild's influence from across the Gate. Farlin's group faced a band of the Stone Lord's men led by the tiefling Cairos , under the Wyrm's Crossing bridge in Rivington , hoping to seize their illegal goods haul. However, the meeting devolved into a battle. Farlin's and her squad's fate remained uncertain, whether they were killed by the gangsters or survived and returned safely to the Guild's safehouse.</p>
