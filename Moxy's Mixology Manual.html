<p>Moxy's Mixology Manual was a book dedicated to the art of mixology and collecting numerous alcoholic drink recipes, penned sometime in or before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>The reader could consider Moxy's to be a comprehensive guide to cocktails, despite its crass wording and the author's preference for the drinks made with gin -and- whiskey . The book also included recipes for vodka , vermouth , and rum and did not miss a chance to denigrate them as inferior. Lastly, the author recommended that readers never call themselves "mixologists," professional, or amateur; instead preferring the term "bartender." Moxy clearly thought that calling oneself a mixologist made one sound like a "pillock."</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a copy of Moxy's Mixology Manual could be found in the hands of the proprietors of The Singing Lute eatery in the city of Baldur's Gate .</p>
