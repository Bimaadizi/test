<p>Wyndor's herbs were a type of herb with healing properties.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Steeped in hot water and prepared as a tea, Wyndor's herbs were effective for healing, though it tasted very bitter and caused discomfort in the form of nausea, shaking, and weakness before sleep eventually took over. By taking the herbs, a whole week's worth of healing was done in a space of twenty-four hours, though upon waking the consumer would be extremely hungry.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of Wyndor's herbs was counteracted by the fact that if someone was already too injured, then Wyndor's would kill instead before healing.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Florozt'a prepared a tea of Wyndor's herbs for Druhallen and Tiep to heal their injuries after a battle.</p>
