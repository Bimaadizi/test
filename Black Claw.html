<p>The Black Claw was an orc horde assembled by the Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Crimson Magics, 1026 DR , the Black Claw horde was formed with the intention of destroying Waterdeep after the Brotherhood's previous attempt, the Broken Bone horde, succumbed to Lhammaruntosz . The horde carried out massive raids on the Free City of Waterdeep, notably a siege known as the Battle of Blood-Drenched Swords . Their arrows felled many members of the Griffon Cavalry , including Lord Palinor Belabranta .</p>
<p>The horde successfully killed the Waterdeep's leader, Warlord Laroun , before finally being defeated in the Stump Bog by Laroun's successor, Raurlor . Their defeat marked the end of Uruth Ukrypt and the Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge as major players in the region.</p>
