<p>Spice , also known as deg in Dwarvish , was a broad term for a variety of seeds, roots, and bark that were primarily used for seasoning or flavoring food. They were often dried, ground up into a powder, and mixed together with a variety of other spices. Over time the advancement of long distance trade caused spices that were once exclusive to a single region to be spread far and wide across Toril .</p>
<p>Travelers on Toril typically kept spices in little glass vials , encased in whittled wooden 'shielding shells' to guard against breakage. These were carried inside of drawstring leather pouches , known as spice pouches. Such pouches had the "finished" side as their interior, thus minimizing reactions with the vials' contents.</p>
<h2>Varieties</h2>
<p>Spices used throughout Toril included the following:</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 920 DR , the merchant Windyn Balindre returned to Faerûn from Kara-tur with some of that land's unique spices in tow.</p>
<p>In 1238 DR , a major trade war began between the Amnian merchant families House Ulvax and House Ophal. This was due to the latter causing House Ulvax's spice trade with Zakhara to dwindle. The feud between them would persist for over a hundred years, igniting numerous other trade wars. Eventually, it would culminate in the Murann Spice War in 1338 DR . The Council of Six would go on to punish House Ulvax for instigating the conflict by revoking their right to engage in the Zakharan spice trade.</p>
<p>At some point prior to 1352 DR , General Hie Aie Shek cleared out bandits that were scouring the Spice Road .</p>
<p>From 1356 DR to 1374 DR the Highmoon Trading Coster was known to trade the spices arispeg, marka, and delph.</p>
<p>Around 1359 DR , the following spices were known to be carried by caravans along the Spice Road: Camphor, Caramon, Ginseng, Myrrh, Nutmeg, and Saffron.</p>
<p>Around 1367 DR , a trio of traveling merchants that hailed from Anauroch were trading a variety of spices in Shadowdale in return for silver . Some of their spices included curry, pepper, and rock salt.</p>
<p>For many decades the four rival trading families of Marsember shipped spices to and from lands all across the Inner Sea . Over time they became the city's main export and earned it the moniker "City of Spices." In the years leading up to 1370 DR the city's dominance in the spice trade waned as other kingdoms started getting involved in exporting condiments to the Sword Coast , such as Westgate and Nimpeth .</p>
<p>Around 1370 DR, Mithral Hall 's alliances with surface kingdoms allowed for the importation of many spices that were once unknown to denizens of the Underdark. Also during this time, spices were one of the few industries of trade that the nation of Thay had with the lands west of it.</p>
<p>Around 1372 DR , rare spices were known to travel across the Black Road . Around this time an investment of 100 gp worth of western goods could fetch over 500 gp worth of silk and spices from Kara-Tur.</p>
<p>During the Time of Troubles , House Se'Sehen were known to trade rare spices in return for either slaves or a means by which to transport their spies to northern ports.</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century, merchants from further south were known to trade spices in the city of Bryn Shander . Around this same time, merchants were known to travel to Port Nyanzaru from as far away as the Sword Coast in order to purchase the unique spices of Chult .</p>
<h2>Prices</h2>
<p>In the bazaars of Zakhara the native spices could generally be bought for around 7 silver pieces to 2 gold pieces per pound.</p>
<p>In the 14 th century DR, markets in Waterdeep sold most spices for around 5 copper pieces to 8 gold pieces per dry 1 oz (28 g), though saffron in particular sold for 40 gold pieces per dry 1 oz (28 g).</p>
