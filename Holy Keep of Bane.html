<p>The Holy Keep of Bane was a temple to Bane the Black Lord found in the city of Bral on the Rock of Bral in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It stood in the Low City of Bral, at the heart of the block of buildings between Squid Street, Galleon Street, Lamp Street, Tops'l Street, and Sailmaker Street, and near to Cap'n Gyudd's Nautical Goods .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>One of the lesser shrines and temples in Bral, the Holy Keep stood within an old and dilapidated building, but it had some unspecified importance and prosperity.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The temple was attended by only a few dozen Banites, all of them evil warriors and mages.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>An adventuring priest of Bane and member of the Zhentarim known as Halwarin established the Holy Keep in the mid-1300s. Halwarin was committed to spreading the Banite faith to the stars, but after eight years it remained a lesser faith in Bral, and this was not aided by the god himself being inconveniently dead at the time.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>The majority of Bralians saw it as just another looney cult and dismissed them. Nevertheless, members of the Tenth Pit on Bral contacted Halwarin; they sought to use the Banite faith to gain power, but Halwarin would not yoke Bane's cause to theirs.</p>
