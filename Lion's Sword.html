<p>The Lion's Sword was the Tethyrian sword of state, wielded by princes and kings of the kingdom for centuries.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The state sword of Tethyr had a hilt of gold , carved into the shape of a lion . The body, rear legs and tail made up handle and pommel, with its forelegs and front paws forming the crossguard. The head of the lion had open jaws, with diamond -encrusted mithral teeth set into the groove of the blade, which extended from the gaping maw. Two rubies were inset within the lion's eyes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The sword was originally forged for King Alemander I by a dwarven ally of his in the Year of the Rose Pearls, 1122 DR . The wizard -king further enchanted the blade, transforming it into a flame tongue . It was wielded by the monarchs and heirs of Tethyr until the Year of Starlight, 1215 DR , when King Coram IV forged the Sword of Starlight for his son Haedrak II .</p>
<p>The Lion's Sword was wielded by the Shade King Kymer , the illegitimate son of King Alemander II , before it was reclaimed by Haedrak II when he reclaimed the throne of Tethyr in the Year of the Wall, 1227 DR .</p>
<p>It was believed to have been lost when King Jaszur was killed in Waterdeep in the Year of the Ormserpent, 1295 DR , but was returned to the kingdom by Haedrak , the long-lost son of Alemander IV and rightful heir to the throne, some seven decades later.</p>
