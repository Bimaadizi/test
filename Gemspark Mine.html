<p>The Gemspark Mine was a mine in Damara that was known for its riches.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The mine was rich in gems , such as quartz and hematite , which sparked in the walls and ceilings like stars.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The mine was located in the kingdom of Damara inside of the mountains very near to the elven village of Cedarleaf in the Rawlinswood .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid-to-late 13 th century DR , the mine was used by Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun to imprison two opposing extraplanar generals, Ygorl the slaad lord and Cireka the githyanki , inside of a demon stone .</p>
<p>In the early 1370s DR, the mine was overrun by an orc clan, and was governed by their chieftain. When the adventurers Rhannek , Illius , and Zhai entered the mine, Zhai commented that she had heard about its riches since she was a child. Illius believed that there were orcs around the bend, and was proven correct when the team were ambushed by orcs. After slaying these orcs, several crysmal spiders descended upon them, and a pair of orc archers began to open fire.</p>
<p>The group made it into the throne room, where orcs appeared, but this time threw sleeping gas at the party. Rhannek and Illius were caught and thrown into a cage, whilst Zhai disappeared into the shadows. She managed to slay the orcs and rescue her companions. The orc chieftain rushed into the room where the companions stood, and tried to bring them down. He threw lightning bolts wildly, and assaulted them with fire . After a long fight, the trio succeeded. They searched his body and found gauntlets of ogre power , beads of force , and a ring of jumping .</p>
<p>On the wall, Illius spotted his family crest, Zhai saw a symbol resembling the wood and dark elves , and Rhannek noticed the mark of the trolls that attacked Nesme . Thus, the adventurers believed that they'd been brought to this area by fate. Beyond these walls, the party inadvertently freed Ygorl and Cireka from their prison, who began battling in front of their eyes. It seemed as if the generals would destroy everything in their path. The party then ran towards Cedarleaf , a nearby village, to make sure the wood elves who inhabited it were safe.</p>
<p>Ygorl subsequently used the mine to gather power from the gems and crystals. He stationed his slaad army here. From the mine, Ygorl opened up a portal to Limbo , to try and lead the trio into giving him the Silver Sword of Gith . After defeating Ygorl, the three adventurers returned to the mine, then headed off towards Cedarleaf village.</p>
