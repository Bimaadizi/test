<p>In his youth, Abelar was an adventurer but later he went to serve his father Endren Corrinthal , the lord of Saerb .</p>

<p>When in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR he heard about the sack of Corrinthal Estate and the abduction of his son, Abelar blamed his god. In desperation, Abelar asked the help of Erevis Cale and Drasek Riven to save his son and had his vengeance upon Malkur Forrin , but in killing the cruel mercenary he lost his faith.</p>
<p>Afterward, Abelar led the refugees of Saerb to Daerlun but the rising of the Shadowstorm ruined his plan. He decided to assist Cale, Riven, and even Rivalen Tanthul in the battle against Kesson Rel and in the battle against the shadows he regained the benevolence of Lathander.</p>
