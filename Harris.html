<p>Harris was a human commoner inhabitant of Neverwinter 's Beggar's Nest in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Harris was an aged human man with a light skin tone and hair and mustache bleached by time.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the time the Wailing Death ravaged Neverwinter in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Harris's home district, Beggar's Nest, was hit the hardest. Those who died of the plague were burned on the city streets, and, to make things worse, the district erupted in a zombie infestation. Harris managed to evacuate from the district before it was quarantined off by the Neverwintran militia. Now homeless, Harris had to sleep on city streets by a beggars' campfire in the City Core , where he became trapped by the city's exits being sealed off in the same quarantine that closed the Nest off.</p>
