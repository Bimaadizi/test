<p>Vapor rats were a creature that resembled gray-furred giant rats , but were connected to the element of air .</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>In their normal, physical state vapor rats were very fast. They were also adept at swimming and could rapidly burrow through loose soil.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Vapor rats were able to alter their physiology, transforming into a gaseous form that resembled the wisps of a cloud or similar vapors. In this state they were able to steer their bodies through wind, granting them a form of flight.</p>
<p>These creatures always assumed this gaseous form whenever they felt seriously threatened or were injured. When in this form they could only be harmed by means of magical fire or lightning, as well as exceptionally strong winds.</p>
<p>Whenever a vapor rat was killed or seriously wounded a small cloud of noxious fumes would emanate from their bodies, similar to the spell stinking cloud . They always directed the release of this gas, having it affect a particular target. Beyond 8 feet (2.4 meters) this gas dissipated.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Vapor rats typically attacked other creatures with their sharp teeth whenever they were angry, hungry, or cornered.</p>
