<p>She notably worked with Zehira Deryan , a protector of storm giant queen Serissa .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Remallia was a noble sun elf living in Waterdeep in Ulbrinter Villa , once the home of her husband Arthagast. At some point she joined the Harpers.</p>
<h3>Tyranny of Dragons</h3>
<p>During the 1480s DR, the Cult of the Dragon raided Ulbrinter Villa in search of a draconic artifact stolen by a Zhentarim agent, and killed Lord Arthagast. Lady Remallia took decisive action in response, methodically and purposefully dismantling the cult's operations with all the resources at her disposal. She was the decisive force in uniting the Five Factions in the Council of Waterdeep, founded to combat the menace of the Cult of the Dragon. For her efforts she was chosen as the Harpers' representative on the Council. While Remallia was proactive in fighting the Cult, she had to exercise caution due to the Harpers' precarious position of having just been recently reformed. In the end, the Five Factions raised a massive army and defeated the cult's goddess Tiamat at her temple in the Well of Dragons .</p>
<h3>Against the Red Wizards</h3>
<p>Lady Remallia then turned her attention towards the Cult of the Dragon's onetime allies, the Red Wizards of Thay . She worked with her fellow Harpers and a group of adventurers to investigate a Red Wizard safehouse in Waterdeep's Dock Ward , then directed them to take information they recovered to Candlekeep for interpretation. A short time later, she was summoned to the Maelstrom by the storm giant queen Serissa.</p>
<p>Remallia's investigation led to the discovery of the Tenebrous Creed , a sect of Shar -worshiping cultists obsessed with the Far Realm , and the being known as Father Llymic . She worked with adventurers and Harpers in the Moonsea region to recover a living blade of disaster that was unearthed by the Red Wizards. Working with Zehira Deryan, Remallia directed the party to form a lookout post Abeiran necropolis of Xorvintroth deep underground in Icewind Dale , and soon joined them in their efforts to spy on the Red Wizards.</p>
<p>During her stay in the city, Remallia became afflicted with some unknown malady. She began to unknowingly harm herself, leaving wounds that created ichor-filled boils upon her skin. She began muttering to herself, about strange "slivers" that communicated with one another. Despite this, she still managed to work with her adventurer allies to free the slaves the Red Wizards had made captive in Xorvintroth, and uncover what they truly sought out: the Supreme Forge .</p>
<h3>Return to Waterdeep</h3>
<p>In the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR , the goddess Eilistraee returned to the Realms near the walls of Waterdeep. In turn many of the goddess' drow followers traveled to the City of Splendors en masse . Some of their numbers approached Remallia and requested aid in constructing a temple of Eilistraee in the city. Lady Remallia agreed to provide her support to their cause. [ page needed ]</p>
