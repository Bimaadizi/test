<p>Smuggler's Stone was a fishing village in southeastern Cormyr on the coast of Dragonmere ( Lake of Dragons ).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Smuggler's Stone was named for a large rock that sheltered the small harbor of the village. By the 1360s DR , this harbor had been used by smugglers and pirates for centuries.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The village was located midway between the Wyvernflow to the west and Mistwater River to the east. It lay on the Bluemist Trail that ran along the coast from Marsember in the west to Dawngleam in the east.</p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>The fishermen's huts were clustered around the steep sides of the stormy cove and were supported on stilts that made the dwellings creak during strong winds.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>By 1367 DR , it was against Crown law to set up lights on the Stone because they were once used to help pirates and smugglers guide themselves into the harbor. War Wizards observed the area with the farscry spell and alerted the Purple Dragons if illegal activity was detected.</p>
<h2>Rumors and Legends</h2>
<p>There were many tales of unclaimed treasure stashed by pirates around the area. Beneath the hills north of the village there was said to be an abandoned mine belonging to the gnomes .</p>
