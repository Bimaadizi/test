<p>Moontouch Oak was the name of both a gargantuan oak tree in Cormanthor and a temple to Rillifane Rallathil that was nestled within its main branches. Some believed it was possibly the largest oak tree in all of Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This tree was located in the Tangled Trees region of Cormanthor, on the northern bank of Elvenflow .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>This oak stood over 300 feet (91 meters) tall. The temple atop it consisted of a network of platforms sculpted from its branches, as well as hollows cultivated in its trunk, that were all linked together by bridges of woven vines. The temple remained hidden to outsiders thanks to the oak's thick leafy coverage and due to use of hallucinatory terrain .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This oak has been occupied ever since the early days of Sy-Tel'Quessir settlement in the Arcorar by green elven druids of the Circle of Emerald Leaves .</p>
<p>Between -985 and 205 DR , the Moontouch Oak was regularly under siege by Venominhandar and his minions, though it was never abandoned. Following that green dragon 's death, the druids of Moontouch Oak would lead the efforts to reclaim the Tangled Trees woodland (then known as Tangled Vale).</p>
<p>When the Army of Darkness ravaged Cormanthyr nine centuries later the druids of Moontouch Oak remained firm protectors of their home in the face of assaults led by nycaloths , assuring that it was never violated.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Moontouch Oak temple always had at least twenty green elven druids living inside it. In 1371 DR , the temple was being led by Katar Oakstaff .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Some elven legends claimed that the Moontouch Oak was the still-living remnants of an avatar of Rillifane Rallathil. These same legends claimed that it had led the Sy-Tel'Quessir eastward, away from the ravages of the Crown Wars .</p>
