<h2>History</h2>
<p>Wurthek was a mapmaker and an explorer, one of many who lost their lives to the grave dangers of Chultan Peninsula . He died sometime before 1362 DR , and his body was returned to Port Castigliar . He was buried according to Chultan traditions with a simple flat gravestone that read "Here lies Wurthek of Tethyr. He has gone to chart the realms beyond." as an introduction for Ubtao , when the deity was to arrive to collect the soul of the deceased adventurer. His final resting place within Port Castigliar's graveyard, adjacent to Ibn Engaruka 's general store and the headstone was carved by Ibn himself.</p>
<p>In 1362 DR, Artus Cimber came across the mapmaker's grave marker, covered in Chultan creeping vines . Artus wondered if Wurthek's family know of the man's fate, even though Ibn Engaruka tried to pass the dead adventurers' names back to Faerûn , it was not known if the sad news ever reached them.</p>
