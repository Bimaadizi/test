<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Winding tunnels and caves were scattered throughout the pit.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Pit of a Thousand Voices was reserved for holy slayers who committed vile crimes against the doctrines of their order. Holy slayers brought here were lowered into the pit, where a sound like a group of baying hounds and wailing moans greeted them.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>A gibbering mouther called Al-Bakbuk lived within the pit. It consumed anything lowered into the darkness, adding to its ghastly bulk.</p>
<p>A pack of ghouls serving Akim al-Kalaas also lived within the pit, feeding on any scraps of flesh left by the gibbering mouther. The ghouls worshiped a living idol housed within one of the larger caverns.</p>
