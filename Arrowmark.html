<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Arrowmark was a small and exceptionally quiet tassel. It was so unassuming that many Tassadrans did not even know the hamlet existed. Arrowmark was composed of cottages built along a very straight main road, built in the shade of the large trees found in the area.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Arrowmark was located in Tasseldale , to the northeast of Archtassel .</p>
<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>Arrowmark, despite it's sleepy reputation, was famous for the quality of the arrows and bows produced by the locals. An arrow from Arrowmark was always marked with small spiral that held a heart with an arrow piercing it. This mark was made near the tip of the shaft. The bowyers and fletchers of Arrowmark tended to test their new arrows and bows on the main street of the hamlet, taking advantage of its straightness. A sounding of three chimes warned of an upcoming test.</p>
