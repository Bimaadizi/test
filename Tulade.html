<p>Tulade was a poison that could be mixed with alcoholic beverages. It was brewed from natural substances found in the Savage Frontier .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tulade was made by boiling a secret combination of fungi , mosses , and barks in water. The poison had no discernible taste, but caused tiny black bubbles with an oily sheen to appear in the beverage into which it was mixed. The strength of the effect depended on the concentration consumed and now long it had been mixed with alcohol. Time and dilution both reduced the effects.</p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>Unless the imbiber resisted the poison, they quickly felt like they'd caught a boulder thrown by a hill giant and soon fell unconscious.</p>
<h2>Notable Users</h2>
<p>The managers of the Moon Mountain Brewery — Yarimmur Borulglar , Kelter Minstrelwish , and Nurvala "Mother" Minstrelwish —secretly brewed this concoction for the Zhentarim and, when ordered to do so, added it to barrels of their ale , rum , or hard cider that were bound for a particular victim.</p>
