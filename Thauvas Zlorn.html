<p>He was a fellow of Naerzil , and served another, unseen mage.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Elminster Aumar made the acquaintance of Thauvas Zlorn without him knowing, while the latter was a minor mage of Thay , around the year 1370 DR . Later, in the early spring of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Elminster disguised himself and infiltrated the Righful Conspiracy, where he met Thauvas Zlorn in his disguise as Khornadar of Westgate. The latter tried to magically pry into the mind of Elminster, but saw nothing of import; during their conversation, he mentioned his intention to call upon the Society of Stalwart Venturers to retrieve lost magic.</p>
<p>Elminster later held up Thauvas as the meeting was raided by the War Wizards of Cormyr , intending to question the man. After a brief magical struggle, Elminster captured him. He admitted to the intention to use the Society of Stalwart Venturers in the aftermath of a successful conspiracy. His interrogation was cut short by the arrival of Narnra Shalace , a Waterdhavian thief , who'd followed Elminster into the meeting, and then ran into him again while escaping the approaching War Wizards. Elminster used much magic to breach his mind.</p>
<p>He was later released as reinforcements came for the Red Wizards; on the arrival of his fellow Red Wizard, Naerzil, he pretended to take control, ordering Naerzil to take everyone prisoner. When Naerzil said Thauvas's own survival depended on a later decision by their superiors, Thauvas spoke with a voice different from his own, and attacked him suicidally, using a spell that echoed Elminster's movements a moment prior. This strongly implied Elminster was controlling him. Thauvas was killed in the attack.</p>
