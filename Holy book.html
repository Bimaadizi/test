<p>Holy Books were objects that priests and other divine spellcasters could use to learn new spells . Despite the denomination, holy books were not necessarily books per se but could take unusual forms such as magically floating bronze scales, a thick everbright chain, or a crystal ball . The term was also sometimes used as a catchall for sacred books, such as religious canons.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<h3>Temple Tomes</h3>
<p>In their most usual form, holy books were tomes containing a collection of prayers and rituals dedicated to a specific deity . Those prayers could be used to learn new divine spells , but that privilege was usually reserved those faithful to that deity. A typical holy book could teach around 10 to 20 spells.</p>
<p>The most common of holy books were called temple tomes , because they were jealously guarded in holy temples . Temple tomes were usually stored in highly protected vaults or hidden chambers, and some clergies went as far as displaying replicas on elevated reliquaries for their flocks to admire. Stored temple books were often guarded by magical guardians chosen amongst those whose natural powers would not damage the items.</p>
<p>Holy books were crafted with lots of care. Some were made of rare and expensive materials, such as the hide of exotic beasts, in order to impress the devout. Others were built with durability in mind, using methods such as stamping words on everbright metal pages.</p>
<p>Supplicants desiring to consult a temple tome were often required to jump through many hoops, such as performing difficult or humiliating tasks for the clergy, or paying a hefty fee. Accessing such a book was only possible for members of that clergy or for members of other churches that had at least a cordial relation with them, however many temples would sell scrolls of spells copied from those booksâ€”at a high price. Consulting a temple tome was always done under the strict supervision of guardian priests powerful enough to prevent the book being stolen or damaged. Unveiling of such books was a rare event, and as such was often accompanies with chanting, rituals and public drama, ruining any chance for anonymity.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Typical holy books didn't magically affect individuals who simply read them or shifted their pages (as opposed to magical books such as the Book of Vile Darkness ). It was however a common occurrence for those books to be protected by glyphs of warding unleashing magical defenses against creature of the wrong alignment , race, or even temple rank. Such glyphs were carefully crafted by the churches with divine approval, and were hidden alongside various symbols, holy runes, and "dummy" glyphs designed to waste the spells and time of intruders.</p>
<p>Because of the divine permission granted by deities, holy books could be used by priests of the corresponding faith to learn spells outside the spheres normally available to them.</p>
