<p>Dame Aylin was an aasimar and the daughter of the goddess Selûne , who was imprisoned within the Shadowfell by General Ketheric Thorm in the 14 th and 15 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She had pale skin that was uniquely blemished, appearing as cracked marble , and light blonde hair she kept sheared on one side and long, brushed back along the other. She had white, feathered wings that granted her flight.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Aylin was a strong-willed, resilient and vengeful person. If she were ever wronged, Aylin would vow the full revenge with the full wrath of the heavens upon her foes. She was also quite direct, particularly about her feelings, even openly discussing her sexual attraction to Isobel in front of new friends. It was possible Aylin's vengeful, brash personality was the result of the trauma from a century of suffering as Ketheric Thorm's source of immortality, being repeatedly murdered by Sharrans in their initiation rite and the horrific experiments and torture Balthazar subjected her to.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Aylin served her divine mother Selûne as a paladin .</p>
<p>Some time during the late 14 th century DR, Aylin fell in love with Isobel Thorm , a devoted follower of Selûne. Isobel's father, Ketheric, assumed the love wasn't genuine but was wrong; even after over one hundred years being tortured and repeatedly killed and resurrected in the Shadowfell, Isobel's death was still a painful memory for Aylin. She also referred to Isobel as "her consort" while praying to Selûne, giving the relationship a formal affirmation.</p>
<p>Her relationship with Ketheric himself was more complicated. He didn't approve of Aylin being intimate with his daughter, likely due to the difference in lifespan and rank. Yet she was the daughter of Ketheric's patron deity, so the two kept a respectful distance from each other. When Isobel died, they both shared the pain of her loss, but did not bond over the experience. Any good will Aylin may have had towards Ketheric ended when he tricked her into the soul cage in Shadowfell. His betrayal of Selûne, especially given he abandoned the deity's service in favor of Shar , deceiving her and the pain and abuses she suffered there gave Aylin a deadly, burning hatred of Ketheric.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime during the late 14 th century DR, Aylin met Isobel Thorm , a devoted follower of Selûne. The two fell in love at first sight, though it was a while after when Isobel learned that Aylin returned her feelings. Isobel's father, Ketheric, assumed the love wasn't genuine, but didn't interfere in the relationship. When Isobel was murdered by unknown assailants, Aylin grieved deeply.</p>
<p>During the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Ketheric Thorm and his advisor Balthazar tricked and abducted Dame Aylin with a tale that someone needed her help. After being captured, Aylin was imprisoned within a soul cage in the Shadowfell for his then-goddess Shar. In return, Ketheric would be spared the loss and pain that accompanied the death of his daughter Isobel, who happened to be Aylin's lover. After Aylin was imprisoned behind a gate underneath the Gauntlet of Shar , the immortal strength of Aylin's soul was transferred to Ketheric by unholy necromantic magic, granting the general eternal life.</p>
<p>Aylin was subjected to a century of torture and brutal experiments by Balthazar, including having her tongue removed at least once. She was also repeatedly slain by the goddess' would-be Dark Justiciars time and time again, only to return trapped within her cage. During this time, Dame Aylin came to be known as the Nightsong . Isobel never forgave her father for the horrors he subjected Aylin to.</p>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the wizard Lorroakan of Baldur's Gate attempted to secure the Nightsong for himself. He posted a bounty offering much riches for her retrieval. At least one adventuring party, led by Aradin , took the mage up on his offer.</p>
