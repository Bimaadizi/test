<p>The Men of the Red Kestrel were a group of stalwart adventurers, active circa 1358 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1358 DR, the Men of the Red Kestrel sought a way through the Great Glacier to the east from the Bloodstone Lands . When they arrived at the village of Sundice , they shared stories of encountering dwarves , frozen within the Great Glacier. These mysterious dwarves wore exquisitely crafted sets of armor and weapons, unseen within the Realms of the 14 th century DR . The adventurers brought two of these pieces of rare weaponry along from the trip across the Glacier, a long sword and a warhammer of great quality.</p>
<p>Both items were bought by Eldaerim of Sossal , who decided to become a sponsor for the Men of the Red Kestrel's next foray into the Great Glacier.</p>
