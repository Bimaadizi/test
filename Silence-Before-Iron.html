<h2>History</h2>
<p>Silence-Before-Iron hailed from the Land of Intrigue, Amn . She lived her life following the teachings of the mysterious monastic Old Order.

The tiefling's ideals embraced silence, shadow, ice, fear, and wind.</p>
<p>In the Year of Storms, 1310 DR , Silence-Before-Iron found herself in the northern city of Luskan , where she joined the Annals of Halgren. The adventuring troupe searched for mercenaries and Silence-Before-Iron gladly offered her fists.</p>
