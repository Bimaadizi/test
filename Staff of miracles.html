<p>A staff of miracles was an ancient, magical elven weapon of old Myth Drannor that, while common there, was quite rare in 14 th century DR . They possessed a number of powerful abilites and spell -like effects.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The staff was made from white wood and adorned with the various dwarven , elven , gnome , halfling , and human deities once worshiped within Myth Drannor .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When held, the staff would flash a brilliant, blue-white radiance and grant a +4 protection to up to four beings touching it. It also allowed the wielder to cast the spells heal , once per day, holy aura and rosemantle , and allowed them to delay death, as per the spell death's door , once per day.</p>
<p>Additionally, once every 66 days, the staff of miracles granted the wielder one limited wish , with a few caveats. It did not age the wielder, could not be used to reverse a death caused by the staff and could only undo or reverse any actions taken within a minute prior of being cast.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Analogous to the powers the staff granted, the spells heal , holy aura and rosemantle were used during its creation.</p>
