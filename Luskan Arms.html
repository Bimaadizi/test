<p>The Luskan Arms was an inn in the town of Targos in Icewind Dale in the 14 th and 15 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It stood near the docks, at the southern end of the harbor.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Luskan Arms was the oldest public house in the Ten-Towns , having been built in the late 1200s DR, while the city of Luskan was still flourishing and back before the founding of Bryn Shander , when it became the tenth town. As Luskar merchants made up the bulk of those who arrived at Targos at the time, the inn was constructed to resemble those common in the City of Sails.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Needless to say, the building was old, and tthough the walls were yet strong, the floorboards were rotting by the late 1400s. This permitted drafts to rise up from the cellar and into the common room. Furthermore, rats infested the walls and were active all through the night.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>As befitted its name and history, the Luskan Arms featured s lot of Luskar decor, much of it almost two centuries old by the 1480s DR. It included a vellum map of Luskan on the wall above the hearth and pennants displaying the coats of arms of the High Captains of Luskan were hung from the walls. As a result, it was a curious flashback to Luskan's glory days, rather than its later decay and corruption.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Owenn Tarsenel was the innkeeper of the Luskan Arms in the 1480s DR. He had scraps of knowledge about Luskan, but it had all been passed down from his father or learned from guests at the inn who'd been through Luskan.</p>
<p>In the late 1480s DR, Naerth Maxildanarr , the Speaker of Targos, occupied the biggest guest suite on a permanent basis. He felt the inn was a good place to meet visitors and that it reminded him of his home city, Luskan. He kept three flying snakes in a cage in his room for use as messengers.</p>
