<p>Wilsey was a mayor of the hamlet of Liam's Hold in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mayor Wilsey was an older woman with white hair, put together in a tight bun. She was dressed in rich brown robes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By 1358 DR , Wilsey has been elected as the Mayor of Liam's Hold and several other helmets along the Trade Way . She was busy with the village's business, ensuring the safety and functionality of the hamlet and the passing caravans. Any visitors were greeted by Mayor's loyal halfling assistant Twinkin .</p>
<p>During Time of Troubles , the nearby monastery, later known as the Stronghold , was exposed as a lair of a villainous Bhaalist sect. However, the inhabitants of the keep mysteriously disappeared during the time when gods walk the Realms. An adventuring bard from Waterdeep discovered the stronghold empty and left the key to the structure with the mayor for safekeeping.</p>
<p>In 1372 DR , Mayor Wilsey offered the empty stronghold to the person known as the Hero of Daggerford as payment for dispatching a gang of ne'er-do-wells - Methro , Jeth , Yage , and Sossi "Munroe" , who roughed up and harassed locals.</p>
<p>The same year, Mayor Wilsey helped the Hero of Daggerford investigate a series of strange occurrences that led to disappearance of Xanda Pennywell , abducted by vampire Sieronius Dethick .</p>
