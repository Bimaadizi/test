<p>Durdyn's Devils were a small mercenary band, mainly composed of drow adventurers. As of 1372 DR , they were investigating Sonjar's Tower for information on the gods of Faerûn on behalf of House Vrasl , while hoping to uncover some Imaskari secret on how to thwart the gods. House Vrasl thought such secrets could be used to uncover the reason for Lolth 's silence.</p>
