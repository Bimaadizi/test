<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She had a fun-loving nature. She often enjoyed the company of men that caught her eye.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Laeral Silverhand found Sharlarra as a thief on the streets of Skullport . Laeral believed the young elf was promising and brought her to her husband, Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun, at Blackstaff Tower. She served as apprentice there for a time, but found her duties dull and uninteresting, so when she had the opportunity at an adventuring life by running after the drow Liriel Baenre in the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR , she took it.</p>
<p>Sharlarra sought out Liriel by locating gems that Liriel had once borne. In the process, she was captured by two men named Chadrik and Dienter , who locked her in a coffin and were subsequently killed by Gorlist 's drow band. She was rescued by Khelben and accepted his offer to come back to Blackstaff Tower, but once there she quickly recanted and continued after Liriel. She was aided in her travels by a ghostly teu-kelytha (a legendary moon horse of Evermeet ) that she christened Moonstone . In Shadowdale , the ghost of Sylune , the Witch of Shadowdale, appeared to them, foreshadowing her future involvement in Liriel's quest. Sharlarra caught up with Liriel and her companion Fyodor in Dernovia , Rashemen , where she aided in their defeat of the drow band chasing Liriel.</p>
<p>Sharlarra subsequently traveled with Liriel and the lythari Thorn for at least ten years, developing a strong friendship with them. Circa Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , she was with them in Hlammach , Impiltur , serving as a hired blade for the Impiltur military.</p>
