When Mystra was killed and the multiverse went awry, a "chunk" of the Blood Rift was ripped away from the main plane, trapping Vhissilka and soldiers from both sides. After Tauran , Aliisza , Kael , Kaanyr Vhok , and Zasian Menz accidentally arrived in that remnant, Vhok abandoned them and joined up with Vhissilka. Vhok and Vhissilka escaped and returned to the balor Axithar, who invaded the House of the Triad with the intelligence provided by Vhok.</p>
