<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Uktar , Nightal of the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Pom Fritte Fromage announced the formation of the so-called Halfling Nation . The knight's reasoning and plans for the new-fangled nation were laid out in the interview conducted by Jennylou Brightleaf of the Ravens Bluff Trumpeter broadsheet . The interview occurred in Sir Fromage's large suite in the Seven Tigers Inn . The knight stated that elves and dwarves formed cities, towns, and nations of their own, unlike the hin (strangely forgetting about the existence of Luiren ). However, he did not propose that halflings leave Ravens Bluff and start a farming community elsewhere. The Bluff has all the amenities the eccentric knight wanted, food was acceptable, and the lodgings were tidy. When asked what laws this proposed Halfling Nation would follow, Sir Fromage declared his commitment to the Golden Rooster and the city's laws. The halfling ended the interview as he needed to supervise the construction of his wine tasting room and closed it by declaring that all haltings who were interested in joining the "nation" were to stop at the Seven Tigers Inn and book a room using the special Halfling Nation rate.</p>
