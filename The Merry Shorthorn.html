<p>Long before the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , The Merry Shorthorn belonged to Prophia Copperfire , a traveling half-elf bard of some renown. She carried the instrument with her across Faerûn, and some even claimed the flute accompanied its mistress to the Elemental planes , Elysium , and even Baator . She was known to have traveled across the Spine of the World and reached the distant Wa . The Merry Shorthorn was used to entertain pashas of Calimshan , soften hearts of angry holy slayers in Zakhara , and was sung along by boisterous sailors of the Sea of Fallen Stars . Subsequently, the The Merry Shorthorn was lost somewhere in the hot sands Anauroch .</p>
<p>By 1281 DR , The Merry Shorthorn made its way to the Spine of the World and into the hands of Uligar , orc chef of the Bleeding Eye tribe. When he was slain in the Kuldahar Pass , the instrument changed owners once again. And by Mirtul of the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , The Merry Shorthorn was in the hands of savage members of the Legion of the Chimera who menaced the Icewind Dale .</p>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , The Merry Shorthorn was in the hands of a merchant of musical instruments, available for purchase from her stall in Targos .</p>
