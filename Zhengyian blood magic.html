<p>Zhengyian blood magic was a magical practice in Vaasa in the 15 th century DR that involved tapping into traces of the dark power of Zhengyi the Witch-King contaminating one's blood. This contamination generally came about after a person's exposure to a Zhengyian relic , but it could also be inherited from a contaminated parent. It was akin to a form of sorcerer origin .</p>
