<p>Chillborn were zombies animated by foul rites that hardened their minds and bodies with the iciness of death.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Chillborn zombies were remorseless, savage, and predatory. They were heedless of their own safety as they obeyed the will of their creator, and would attack their targets in straightforward charges, targeting weaker victims first.</p>
<p>They were generally disorganized and unintelligent, although they could at least make use of ladders .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Chillborn zombies could sap the heat from a creature's body, leaving it cold and dead. They radiated an aura of intense cold, with temperatures dropping further when multiple chillborn were near each other. The icy chill of a chillborn's touch could freeze a warm-blooded creature in place, leaving it even more vulnerable to the zombie's freezing blows.</p>
<p>If slain, a chillborn zombie's body exploded in a 5‑foot (1.5‑meter) burst of freezing cold that numbed any creature caught near it.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Hungry chillborn zombies sought to drain the heat and life from warm-blooded victims.</p>
<p>They could be encountered on the Great Glacier , but were not found only in icy regions: they could be encountered in Aglarond and along the shores of the Sea of Fallen Stars , in Neverwinter Wood and the ruins of Illefarn , as well as in the tombs and hidden places of the Sword Coast .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , an unusually intelligent and coordinated group of chillborn zombies had become a particular threat to the land of Vaasa when they were released from the lost city of Vaalathrim after the melting of the Great Glacier released those ruins from the ice. This coincided with attacks by a mysterious, heat-stealing monster in nearby Damara , which had come to be called "the Breath of Winter ".</p>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , a necromancer named Azu Morn plotted to undermine the Masked Lords of Waterdeep , and his first move was to raise a variety of undead in the crypt of the Solemn Order of Recognized Furriers and Woolmen Guild . This included animating the bodies of four former guildmasters as chillborn zombies.</p>
