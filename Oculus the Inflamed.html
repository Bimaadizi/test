<p>Oculus the Inflamed was a unique plaguechanged beholder -like creature that plagued the depths of The Chasm in Neverwinter , during the Spellplague years.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Oculus was an azure floating orb with a single large eye in the middle. Crystalline spikes engulfed in blue flames protruded from the creature's top, and lifeless tendrils hung limply from its sides.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the Spellplague led to the disastrous eruption of Mount Hotenow in the Year of Knowledge Unearthed, 1451 DR , the very foundation of Neverwinter collapsed into a massive subterranean canyon known as the Chasm. It became home to all sorts of aberrant and plaguechanged monsters that threatened what was left of the city. Oculus's presence became known to the Neverwintan adventurers when dark, maddening visions began clouding the minds of those who came to the creature's vicinity in The Jagged Approach of the Chasm.</p>
<p>With the advent of the Second Sundering and the Chasm being sealed for good, Oculus the Inflamed moved its lair to the environs of Neverwinter, still retaining its plaguechanged abilities.</p>
