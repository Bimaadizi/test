<p>Wormskull the Artificer was a mad inventor and bloodforge mage in the Utter East during the time of the Bloodforge Wars ( 648 â€“ 657 DR ). Notably, he worked at the Hall of Wonder , used the Pearl of Power to create the Juggernaut , and burned the city of Konigheim .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Wormskull was a short, gnarled man with brown hair and a bad case of balding.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Although a genius, Wormskull was said to be mad and obsessed with the Pearl of Power. He lacked social skills, had suffered bullying and insults, and had been forced to beg. Thus, he believed society had abused him all his life, and to settle his troubled mind, he sought an epic retribution.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Wormskull was the brother of Garrulos , who presented himself as a noble crusader. The two couldn't've been more unalike, in temperament, skills, size, and looks. About the only thing they had in common was the chin. Needless to say, they feuded a bit.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Garrulos and Wormskull were a pair of treasure-hunting brothers who delved into an ancient barrow tomb, heedless of a curse said to bring grief and misfortune. They uncovered an artifact known as the Pearl of Power ; legend held that it could make arcane inventions come alive, but that it had a curse that greed would give rise to war and disaster. However, Garrulos immediately snatched it for himself, cheating his own brother of the glory. "For safekeeping", he claimed, Garrulos took it to Konigheim to present it to the king. This act triggered the Nuts and !Bolts ( sic ) conflict between the brothers.</p>
