<p>Eldrin Whisperbark was a young quarter- elf human farmer of the city of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale in the late 14 th century DR . He was also a Scion of the Green Regent .</p>
<h2>Home</h2>
<p>The Whisperbark family lived on a sizeable farm west of Loudwater and south of the Delimbiyr River . It faced onto the river and had several fields, pasturage, and an orchard. The farmhouse lay at the center close to some oak trees.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At the ceremony for the choosing of the Green Regent on Shieldmeet of the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Eldrin was among the volunteers and was accepted as a Scion, which he was quite happy about.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Eldrin was one of a band Scions who tried to trail the Half-Elven Renegades following one of their raids. However, the Renegades turned and ambushed them, and while the other Scions escaped, Eldrin was captured and held for ransom. His family paid the ransom and he was released.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Eldrin was rather charming. His mother was pressuring him to get married and settle down, so he would flirt with any attractive woman (human, elf, or half-elf ) he met, but only if she was receptive. He was a faithful follower of Mielikki .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was quite handsome and fine-featured, with his eyes indicating his elvish heritage. His captivity by the Renegades left him with a scar down the outside of one arm and another across his belly. While a Scion of the Green Regent, Eldrin bore the holy symbol of Mielikki upon his brow, glowing emerald.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Eldrin did farm-work, wood-chopping, and chores during the day. During the evenings, he was a regular of the Merry Mer-She tavern, where he joked and drank with his friends.</p>
