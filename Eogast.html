<p>Eogast was the chief of the drovers leading the animals in adventuress Zaranda Star 's merchant caravan as she traveled from Morninggold Keep to Zazesspur in Mirtul of 1366 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like many dwarves, Eogast was bearded. He was at least 200 years old when he served Zaranda Star.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>When angered, Eogast had been known to stomp his feet, pull out the hair in his beard, and curse vehemently. When not throwing a tantrum, Eogast was otherwise quite patient, especially with his animals.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the party reached a farm that had been raided by bandits, Zaranda ordered her drover-in-chief to pull the animals off the road to protect them and the merchandise, while she and the other adventurers approached the burning farmhouse. She similarly ordered him off the road when the party encountered the orog Shield of Innocence .</p>
<p>When the party arrived at the walls of Zazesspur, Eogast was angered that Zaranda paused the caravan before entering the city through one of the breaches in the wall, but she convinced him that they would have to pay less in bribes that way, and this satisfied him.</p>
