<p>The Helldusk armor was a set of powerful enchanted plate mail forged by the forgemaster Carixim in Avernus sometime before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Wearers of the Helldusk armor received several powerful boons. Firstly, anyone could wear this plate mail as if they were trained in the armor use. When the wearer was targeted by a hostile spell and succeeded at avoiding full damage or shrugged its effects off, the infernal retribution enchantment set the spellcaster on fire, scorching them for eighteen seconds. Additionally, the prime aegis of fire enchantment made the wearer resistant to fire, both mundane and magical, lessened all fire damage received and made it impossible for them to be lit aflame. And lastly, it allowed the wearer to fly at will.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
