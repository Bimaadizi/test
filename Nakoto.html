<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before 1372 DR, a corrupt merchant and politician named Matagar Bugo made a deal with the Xanathar's Thieves' Guild in his prominent rise to power. Eventually, he reached the position of the Duke of Daggerford via an alliance with Zhentarim and "disappearances" of both Duke Pwyll Greatshout and his sister Bronwyn Daggerford .</p>
<p>Nakoto was Matagar's contact with the Xanathar's Guild and once he came to power, she attempted to collect on what was owed to her organization. Bugo used a recently arrived adventurer who was investigating the duke's disappearance to cut ties with Xanathar . He claimed that an unknown party kidnapped Bronwyn Daggerford and was demanding ransom. Bugo sent the hero and their companion to the rendezvous spot in the sewers of Daggerford . Nakoto was waiting there for Matagar himself. She told the hero that they have been duped and that "Matty" was trying to get out of his debt. She attacked the adventurer along with her fellow thieves but was killed in the scuffle.</p>
