<p>A horn of the tritons was a type of enchanted horn fashioned from a conch shell . Created by tritons , these horns gave their wielders some degree of influence over the sea and its creatures.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These horns carried a moderate aura of conjuration and transmutation magic. Earlier versions were claimed by some to be incapable of being played in the hands of a cleric , fighter , or warrior . They could only function in an area of free air, though their powers extended underwater.</p>
<p>A horn of the tritons was imbued with three distinct effects that could be activated separately upon properly blowing it.</p>
<p>For most people, a horn of the tritons could be activated upon per day. Meistersingers and Whistlers , types of specialty bards, were capable of sounding a horn of the tritons twice per day. And tritons could activate the effects of a horn of the tritons three times per day.</p>
<p>Additionally, whenever a horn of the tritons was blown its sound could be heard by all tritons within a radius of 1 league (4,800 meters) or 3 mi (4,800 m).</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Creating a horn of the tritons required a triton artisan skilled in crafting wondrous items and the spells control water , fear , and summon monster V .</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the time approaching the Twelfth Serôs War , the tritons of the Inner Sea ignored the disruptions caused by the evil megalodon Iakhovas , believing it to be an "upwater problem" that would distract them from protecting the ocean floor. They wouldn't involve themselves in the war until a horn of the tritons was stolen by a rogue mermaid and her shalarin companion, who sought to use it to summon aid against their enemies. The tritons gave chase over the theft and not long afterward morkoth allied with Iakhovas invaded the cities of Abydos and Pumana in the Protectorate of Pumanath , taking back fell magic that they would use to fight the Twelfth Serôs War. This caused the tritons to realize their arrogance, and inspired them to join the war soon after.</p>
