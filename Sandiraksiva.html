<p>Sandiraksiva was a great black courser, and vessel of the soul of one of Gaumahavis cubs.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A mighty black horse, Sandiraksiva was exceptionally strong, able to pull as much as two normal horses , exceptionally fast, and had cloven hooves with which to climb the rocky lands of the Katakoro Shan . Standing 6.5 ft (2 m) tall and weighing more than 3,000 lb (1,400 kg), his hooves was as cut by polished black stone, and his eye near shining with yellow light.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>In his young years he preferred to graze in the high meadows and tundras of the Katakoro Shan, but after his imprisonment by the Raja of Solon and later the Dalai Lama he embraced the wild steppes of the Hordelands . He tolerated no other stallions in his herd.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He was able to get energy from the very light of the moon , and it was moonlight that empowered him to be exceptionally strong and fast. Should he miss moonlight for an entire night, his unnatural powers would wane until he once more could bathe in moonlight. From his nose he could launch fireballs against target, and with his hooves he could fly, riding the wind in gallop.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Born as a leopard cub of Gaumahavi, he developed a soul along his mother while Surtava found enlightenment. Several reincarnations later his soul was of the black courser Sandiraksiva. While roaming the high meadows of the Katakoro Shan he was ambushed and captured by the Raja of Solon, Ambuchar Devayam , who used him to coerce his mother Gaumahavi, at that point inhabiting the body of a mighty dragon, to help with the war against Ra-Khati . During the war however the Dalai Lama managed to capture him, though he knew not what the great horse actually was. He was put in a magical prison from where he was unable to escape, and while Hubadais part of Yamun Khahan great horde passed near, king Ambuchar Devayam used the opportunity to threaten Ra-Khati into giving over Tsenya Bhrokiti and Sandiraksiva in return for continued peace. After a long and eventful journey down the Rainbow Falls , he was freed by a group of Tuigan spies who was seeking a way through Ra-Khati and onto Khazari ’s southern flank. The tuigan could not stand to see such a magnificent horse in a cage and were willing to die to free him.</p>
<p>The leader of the local Tuigan force, Hubadai presented gifts to the mighty horse, twenty white mares was given from the horse-riding horde to the great stallion, a mark of respect that Sandiraksiva had not received in more than 50 years of imprisonment, first in Solon and then in Ra-Khati. Hubadai's respect and gifts to Sandiraksiva, led to an understanding between them, and it was not long before Sandiraksiva willingly became the mount of Hubadai. As a respected mount and ally of Hubadai, Sandiraksiva was gifted a further 80 white mares, and ruled over the 100 strong herd, being quite protective of them.</p>
