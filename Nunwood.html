<p>The Nunwood was a forest on the mouth of the Vilhon Reach .</p>
<p>The nearby cities of Reth and Hlath used the Nunwood as their main source of lumber. In 1372 DR , Hlath's main export was Nunwood lumber.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>For a while around 1370 DR , Reth stopped cutting down trees from the Nunwood because of a conflict with the Emerald Enclave . When the lumberjacks eventually returned to the Nunwood, they were confronted by creatures using hit-and-run tactics during the night.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
