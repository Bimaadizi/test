<p>Turquoise was generally found in the more arid locations around Toril .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This ornamental stone was an opaque blue to greenish-blue, and usually occurred with blotches of darker hues in the mix. A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp, except during the Spellplague era when the value jumped to 100 gp.</p>
<p>Turquoise stones were considered sacred by followers of Aerdrie Faenya and Erevan Ilesere â€”appropriate for sacrifice, or to be consecrated for use, or recognized as boons or omens when found.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Elves valued the pure color stones (without the darker mottling) for casting sky-related magic and mages used turquoise in the creation of items related to flight. It was also used as a good luck charm by horsemen who would put a small shard of turquoise in their horse's harness to ward off misstep or trail hazards. Turquoise had a slight gleam when it came near gold and was therefore associated with prosperity. Foredawn was the best time of day to apply an immersion containing turquoise.</p>
