<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Fleabottom decided to break the gang's agreement with the Nashers by kidnapping Gothwan Cooper , the thief of the Crown of Neverwinter , in order to bargain his life for the crown. However, the Nashers abandoned Gothwan and ignored the issue, preferring to maintain the truce. Fleabottom kept Gothwan prisoner in the Dead Rats' hideout in the Blacklake Sewers . Ultimately, an adventurer recruited by Sergeant Knox to retrieve the crown infiltrated the lair and killed Fleabottom to free and question Gothwan.</p>
