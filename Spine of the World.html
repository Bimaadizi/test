<p>The Spine of the World was a mountain range that stretched across the northwest region of Faerûn from the Cold Run near the Sea of Moving Ice , to the Ice Spires north of the Silver Marches .</p>
<p>Folks all across the lands of the Savage Frontier and the Silver Marches , particularly those in Scornubel , referred to the Spine as "the Wall" . On the winter days when the white snow covered faces of the peaks met the iron-gray of the sunless winter sky, it appeared as though the peaks were holding up sky. To others, it simply marked the end of the world as they saw it.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Spine of the World mountains shielded the civilizations of the North from the freezing expanse of the Uttermost North , that comprised the Reghed Glacier and the Endless Ice Sea .</p>
<h2>Geographical Features</h2>
<p>To many Faerûnians , the Spine of the World was simply an endless, nearly–impassable range of high, jagged, perpetually ice-covered mountains. While the western-most edge of the Spine was penetrated by a circuitous, always dangerous trade route to Icewind Dale, the rest of the range was not even approached by those without a stout heart.</p>
<p>Some of the mountains in this range stood over 20,000 feet (6.1 kilometers) tall, and all but the smallest were covered in snow and ice all year–round.</p>
<p>There were four well known sister peaks that were referred to as Firstpeak , Secondpeak , Thirdpeak , and Fourthpeak . The sister mountains were so similar in height that they seemed to form a single line.</p>
<p>The northern slopes of the mountains had plentiful enough trees that loggers of the Ten Towns would risk regular treks back-and-forth across the tundras. The southern slopes, located near the Druarwood and Moonwood forests, were referred to as the Lands Against the Wall .</p>
<h2>Climate</h2>
<p>Like much of the North, these mountains had a subarctic climate. As expected for mountains of that height, the Spine of the World experienced devastating, icy winds. As a result, the mountains experienced frequent rock slides.</p>
<h2>Export</h2>
<p>Glacial streams in the Spine of the World produced crystal-clear drinkable water that was bottled up and shipped south as far as the Western Heartlands and the city of Baldur's Gate .</p>

<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Legends told that the innermost depths of the mountains held long-lost cities, lairs of dragons that had been completely abandoned, and even the frozen remains of dinosaurs .</p>
<p>Some sages believed the mists surrounding the Spine of the World's peaks were home to white dragons or vampiric entities that could transform into clouds. It was said that no mortal person has ever traversed this Realm of the Mists to reach the Realm of the Gods that lay just beyond.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Those creatures that did inhabit the Spine were not spoken of in polite company, and their propensity to raid the lands below kept the conifer-cloaked, stag-roamed rolling foothills relatively uninhabited (as though the Savage Frontier and the Silver Marches were packed)―but it should come as no surprise that several fierce barbarian tribes inhabited these lands, traveling between summer and winter camps.</p>
