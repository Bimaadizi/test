<p>The Council of Spiders was an organization of drow wizards who sought representation on the Ruling Council of Menzoberranzan in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, minor wizards of various noble houses of Menzoberranzan (most prominently House Xorlarrin and House Barrison Del'Armgo ) formed the Council of Spiders to gain seats on the Ruling Council alongside the priestesses of Lolth . A major method was to get the support of a higher-ranking wizard.</p>
<p>Raelaryn Xorlarrin , one of the Council's elders, invited his cousin Hoshtar to a meeting in the ruins of House Srune'Lett 's compound in Narbondellyn . During the meeting, Raelaryn and an elder from House Barrison Del'Armgo were killed by Merinid Dalael , an assassin from the Jaezred Chaulssin , and Hoshtar was taken captive. Adventurers in the employ of House Xorlarrin, House Melarn , and Bregan D'aerthe arrived looking for the prisoner, resulting in a fight with the Council of Spiders. However, the adventurers defeated Merinid and rescued Hoshtarr, discovering the assassins' plot.</p>
<p>The Council also set up a meeting with the Archmage of Menzoberranzan , Gromph Baenre .</p>
<p>By 1486 DR , the Council was sponsored by renegade archmage Vizeran De Vir and they supported him in plots against the matron mothers .</p>
