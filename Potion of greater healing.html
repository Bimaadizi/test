<p>Potions of healing were magic potions that healed the wounds of the creatures who drank them.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Healing potions varied in color, viscosity, and flavor. Most commonly seen potions of blue, slightly phosphorescent hue could be found on the Sword Coast North , Turmish , and Messemprar in Unther and Mulhorand . These potions typically had a pleasant scent of honey and orange blossoms. A milky variety was known in the city of Keczulla in Amn . And some nobles on Waterdeep used thick healing potions of purple color.</p>
<p>Among other flavors, healing potions could resemble warm mead , sweet but heady to taste, or be honey - herb scented. In Velen , a special recipe of healing potions with minty flavor was known to Madame Litaar in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<p>Some potions of healing were known to be a red liquid that shimmered when agitated within its vial .</p>
<p>Many healing potions were marked with a universal sign – a circle, or more complex circle surrounded by radiating rays. The symbol was used by healers and potion makers to indicate the remedial properties of the potions. The symbols were usually placed on vials directly or on the wax seals over the stoppers.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Upon drinking a potion of healing , some of a creature's wounds healed within seconds. There were several different types of potions of healing , which varied mostly by the intensity of their curative power. A potion of healing's curative magic was an effective remedy for muscles, atrophied from being unused.</p>
<p>Any variety of potion of healing could be brewed by anyone skilled with the use of a herbalism kit , even if the brewer did not have any magical ability, provided the raw materials were available. Brewing times varied, as well as cost: the simplest potions of healing took merely a day to brew, while the potent potion of supreme healing took almost a month and was substantially more expensive to produce.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In mid-14 th century DR, a halfling curio merchant in the Yawning Portal , Nalbas, was selling his strange versions of potions of healing claiming them to be as potent as any other version of the potion with the only difference being a bitter taste.</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , potions of healing and potions of greater healing produced by the wood elf druid Fala Lefaliir were available for purchase at Corellon's Crown , a store located in Trollskull Alley in the North Ward of Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Varieties</h2>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>A basic potion of healing could be created using salt of rogue's morsel and an alchemic suspension, while a greater potion of healing could be created using ashes of balsam and a type of salt, a superior potion of healing could be created using salt of yellow musk creeper petals and an alchemic suspension, and a supreme potion of healing could be created using a sublimate of ki-rin hair and plant ashes.</p>
<p>One of the suggested ingredients for crafting a potion of healing or a potion of extra healing was honey from giant bees .</p>
<p>Blueglow moss could be distilled into a potent potion of healing , distinct for its blue color. Although, just like the moss itself, it likely lost its restorative qualities when taken outside of the mythal 's borders.</p>
