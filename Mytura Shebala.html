<p>Mytura Shebala was a warrior-priest of Tyr who headed the Temple of Tyr in Bezantur , Thay during the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mytura had been a mercenary, but dedicated her life to Tyr after experiencing a vision of him during a battle. By the late 1360s DR, she led a small congregation of Tyrran worshipers in Bezantur—a place generally disinterested in lawful gods like Tyr—and had a dozen warrior-priests who reported to her.</p>
