<p>The Inquest was the a group of brilliant inventors that acted as the governing body of the Abeiran city of Xorvintroth .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Using the Supreme Forge within Xorvintroth, members of the Inquest crafted a number of powerful and technologically-advanced artifacts . The devices they created greatly improved the lives of citizens within their city.</p>
<p>They accomplished this feat by combining power they harnessed from the Far Realm along with that of psionics .</p>
<p>They recorded their discoveries upon stone tablets, or within in a series of 'memory pillars', that projected illusory schematics upon nearby walls.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Notable among the group's inventions were far realm batteries , a 'teleportation ray', used to quickly convey individuals across their city, the autonomous metallic peacekeepers , and perhaps their greatest creation, the dragonbone golem .</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The Inquest comprised Xorvintroth's most elite dragonborn artificers . Among these great minds were selected four elders, who actually constructed the group's devices within the Astral Plane .</p>
<h3>Notable Members</h3>
<p>At the time of the Inquest's ruination, its four elders included Ukthet , Lirith , Krektesh , and Graoul .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>They maintained a working relationship with the Key Project team, via that group's liaison Ra'Bindranax .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Over time, the Inquest's elders became concerned their advancements would be taken over by the dragon rulers of Abeir . They were visited shortly thereafter by a being known as the Emissary of the Nine Eyes , who offered them information about another world on which they could peacefully conduct their research.</p>
<p>The Inquest began construction on a "bridge", or portal , that would pierce the Far Realm, and grant them access to their new ideal world. During their experimentations, an elderly humanoid figure stepped through the portal to the Inquest's side on Xorvintroth. This being was an aspect of the elder evil Father Llymic . He provided the dragonborn scholars invaluable information about the Far Realm, allowing them to finally construct the Vast Gate . Thus was formed a permanent link between the Abeiran city and the Far Realm.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the Inquest and all the dragonborn of Xorvintroth, the Vast Gate proved to be the harbinger of their doom. The moment it was activated, the fabric of reality was torn asunder and countless horrors from the Far Realm descended upon the city. The Inquest's four elders remained as "spectral echoes" within the Astral Plane, while their still-living brains remained interred within coffins in the ruins of Xorvintroth.</p>
