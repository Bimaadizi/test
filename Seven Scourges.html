<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before 1372 DR, Amian Niast, a prominent and ruthless merchant from the City of Splendors, employed the Seven Scourges as her personal defenders, enforcers, and mercenaries. Under her command, the Seven Scourges became one of the most feared companies among Amian's competitors. Eventually, five of Seven Scourges started a coup against their benefactress, growing tired of her brutish tactics. The five mercenaries successfully took over her business after laying the merchant's son, their two members who remained loyal to their mistress, as well as Amian Niast herself.</p>
