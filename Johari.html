<p>Johari was a half-orc resident of Neverwinter in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Johari was proud to call Neverwinter her home and naturally felt she and her kind should be afforded the same rights and trust as its other citizens.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Johari tried to enter the Tower District in order to help in the city's fight against the occupying Many-Arrows orcs . However, Patrol Captain Lanward of the Neverwinter Guard was preventing half-orcs passing the Fallen Tower area out of fear they would join the other side. Johari was incensed by this and the two argued. She sought out a half-orc adventurer and Guard recruit to speak to Lanward and allow their kind into the rest of the district.</p>
