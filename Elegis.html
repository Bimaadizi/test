<p>Elegis was a tiefling from the Western Heartlands that was forced to flee from Elturel along with her kin during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Due to the traumas she faced on the road as a refugee, Elegis developed a significant fear of goblins and goblinkind.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the Descent of Elturel in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , where the city was briefly pulled down to the Nine Hells , all the tieflings in the city were expelled due to the mistaken belief they were somehow associated with the catastrophe. Elegis joined the group led by Zevlor one of the city's famed Hellriders , and journeyed with them west towards Baldur's Gate .</p>
<p>When the group was forced to take shelter with the druids of the Emerald Grove due to increased goblinoid attacks across the region, Elegis took post at the great portcullis that shielded the grove and its cave network from the surrounding lands.</p>
