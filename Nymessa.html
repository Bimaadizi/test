<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Nymessa and all the other tieflings within were exiled from Elturel following the city's brief descent into the Nine Hells . The refugees came under the leadership of the exiled Hellrider known as Zevlor . The group traveled west towards the sprawling metropolis of Baldur's Gate , and eventually took refuge at the Emerald Grove after goblin bands harried their march along the road.</p>
<p>After settling into the Emerald Grove the githyanki known as Lae'zel stumbled into a trap just outside the sanctuary's walls, and was soon discovered by Nymessa and her companion Damays . Nymessa exclaimed that the "thing" was dangerous, and that they should just let goblins come and kill her. Damays believed that it might be possible for Lae'zel to escape.</p>
