<p>Ployer was a businessman and slaver of Calimshan who operated businesses in Athkatla during the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Until his holdings were taken from him, Ployer was once a baron from the Calishite Ployer family.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point the Harpers Jaheira and Belgrade discovered and spread word of Ployer's slave-breeding operation in Calimshan. Following these accusations, Athkatlan officials stripped Ployer of his titles and Athkatlan business holdings. He was left completely destitute.</p>
<p>He formulated a plot to take revenge on the Harpers for what he perceived as their "libelous ways". He used the last of his resources to hire Terrece and his spellcasters to develop a lingering curse that would kill the Harper members over time. By the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Ployer managed to afflict the curse upon Belgrade, causing his death. Operating from the Sea's Bounty tavern, he sought out Jaheira to do the same.</p>
