<p>Storna was an island in the Sea of Fallen Stars not far from Telpir . It was used as a monster-breeding ground by Endreth Molipher and three wizard business partners starting around 1359 DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Storna was fairly large, but uninhabited at the time Molipher took it over. It was located about a day's sail southwest of the Dragonisle , some distance off the coast of Telpir. It was dangerous to approach the island because the water was shallow and the only harbor had many rocks (and shipwrecks) as hazardous obstructions. The only structure on the island was the temporary house that Molipher built for a place to stay and meet with his partners.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Molipher was a former pirate who decided to change professions after getting on the bad side of some slavers . He acquired a deepspawn from the estate of one of his victims in Saerloon and decided to use it to produce creatures to feed other monsters. His three partners, Halartan Groune , Orbel Mhaerouzan , and Gorstal Hammers , agreed to bring captured creatures to Storna and let him export them off the island when they were big enough to make a challenging hunt for rich Sembian merchants that wanted a thrilling experience and were willing to pay for it. These sporting excursions were known as Dark Dragon Hunts . Each of the three wizards also used the island as a hiding place, for either themselves or things they didn't want easily found.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In addition to the deepspawn, creatures known to have been advertised for a Dark Dragon Hunt included wild boar , lions , behir , wyverns , stingers , manticores , and a chimera .</p>
