<p>Tim Twofingers was a Sea of Swords sailor and an occasional patron of the Blushing Mermaid in the city of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tim Twofingers was a sailor aboard the ship called Liberty who once sailed alongside Quick-lip Lora , who was a close enough friend who might as well be family. By the time Lora settled in Baldur's Gate and started raising her daughter, Vanra Bergauz , on land, Tim became a frequent visitor to the Gate. He and his crew shared drinks with Quick-lip Lora at the Blushing Mermaid, and Tim came to have familial affection for little Vanra, even gifting her a copy of Adventures on the Sea of Fallen Stars . In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Tim was planning for another visit to the Gate and couldn't wait to see Lora and her daughter, lamenting the passage of time and kids growing fast; his own son was already as tall as Tim.</p>
