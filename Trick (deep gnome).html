<p>Trick was a deep gnome child that lived in a community near the ruins of Dolblunde during the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>While she was rather impetuous, Trick cared deeply about her family and community of gnomes. She was brave enough to take action to ensure their safety, but did not enough sense to fully think through her plans.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>She was an avid tinkerer, having learned some information regarding magic items from her father.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Trick and her sister Trap had two loving parents. Their papa used to tell them stories about a powerful artifact that could disrupt magic all around it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some during the 15 th century DR, Trick and Trap's parents, along with other gnomes in their village, were enslaved by a band of illithids led by the elder brain Zuphelithid .</p>
<p>The two sisters hoped to save their family themselves, by stealing the powerful helmet of disjunction from the traveling paladin, Xenk Yendar . They tricked Xenk into becoming trapped beneath a sleeping earth elemental , and managed to steal the helm away for a few moments. The stalwart paladin was undeterred and caught up with them in short order. The girls explained their situation, along with their desperate need for the powerful artifact, and managed to convince Xenk to help free their people.</p>
<p>As Xenk marched into Zuphelithid's lair alone, Trick and Trap followed a ways behind, keeping the helm of disjunction safe in their custody. The paladin cut through a small horde of intellect devourers but was rapidly overcome by the elder brain's psychic assaults. Trick knew she had to help the champion, so she put on the helm and raced to his aide. Unfortunately, this was exactly the opportunity Zuphelithid needed to claim the artifact for itself. The elder brain stole the helm, and one of its mind flayer servants enthralled the gnome girl.</p>
<p>Trick's sister Trap was determined to save her. Trap and Xenk redoubled their efforts; while the paladin went off to confront the elder brain once again, Trap took a massive, mobile piece of mining machinery and broke through the elder brain's lair. Together they broke through Zuphelithid's defenses and slew the horrific creature.</p>
<p>Trick was freed from her mental domination, and she reunited―not only with her sister Trap―but her parents and the other gnomes of her community. In exchange for his service, Trick helped Xenk find the perfect place in Dolblunde to keep safe the helm of disjunction . The trio of heroes bid each other a fond farewell, grateful for the new allies they had made.</p>
