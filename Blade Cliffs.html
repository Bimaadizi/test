<p>The Blade Cliffs was a chain of dangerous high cliffs on the Sword Coast North , to the southwest from the city of Daggerford and to the south from the Lizard Marsh .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The length of the Blade Cliffs coastline ended in a perilous drop to the sea level and jagged rocks. A large structure of note was Castle Exeltis that was built on a large cliff and protected by a drawbridge across a chasm. On the bottom of the cliffs by the castle was the gravestone monument dedicated to Lady Exeltis, murdered by her son in the 14 th century DR. The rest of the area held several caves that ran deep toward the sea level and lush green woods and vineyards of the Exeltis family. To the south of the noble family's keep, was an old shipwreck impaled by the Blade Cliffs' dangerous rocks.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>The coastline had a population of hungry seagulls and majestic ospreys that used updrafts to glide over the clifftops. An occasional wild boar or deer could be seen dashing through bushes of small delicate grey grapes with wide green leaves not found anywhere else on Faerûn , used to create the famed Exeltis Ice Wine . The sea caves were home to dangerous ochre jellies .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Castle Exeltis was built on the Blade Cliffs several human generations before the late 14 th century DR , and the lands were used by the family's vineyards. The family became its decline after the scion of the Exeltis family murdered his father and, several years later, tossed his mother off the Blade Cliffs. In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Castle Exeltis became besieged by Sir Griswald and his knights seeking to rescue his kidnapped lover.</p>
