<p>The Warehouse District of Port Nyanzaru was a section of the city's Harbor Ward where goods being shipped into or out of the city were stored.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The district was characterized by its canals that separated the rows of warehouses. Full-size merchant ships could be towed through these canals by dinosaurs , allowing for the vessels to be brought straight to the sites where their cargo was to be loaded or unloaded. Because traffic jams were a notable concern with this arrangement, organizing this towing operation was one of the key responsibilities of Port Nyzanzaru's harbormaster.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Warehouse District was located in central Port Nyanzaru, east of the drydocks and west of the public docks.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , the harbormaster in charge of traffic management in the Warehouse District was Zindar .</p>
