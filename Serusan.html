<p>Serusan ( pronounced : /ˈ s eɪ r uː s ɑː n / SAYR-oos-an ), also referred to as Serosian common , was a creole trade language spoken by the various allied races of Serôs , the undersea realms of the Sea of Fallen Stars . It was one of the three most common tongues spoken in Serôs.</p>
<h2>Speakers</h2>
<p>All of the races living within the Shallow depth zone of the Inner Sea (which extended as far down as 150 ft (46 m) ), namely those whose racial languages influenced the development of Serusan, were more than capable of speaking and understanding it. However, unless one had fluency in Serusan itself, only basic meanings and subjects could be grasped in a conversation. These races included dolphins , kuo-toa , locathah , merfolk , sahuagin , sea elves , half-sea elves , and shalarin . Additionally, many water genasi living around the Inner Sea tended to learn Serusan in order to converse with the various aquatic races therein.</p>
<p>Surface regions where Serusan was commonly spoken as a secondary language included the nation of Altumbel , the coast Wizards' Reach , and the Dragon Coast . Many surface dwellers learned how to speak Serusan from seeking teaching within the underwater city of Myth Nantar .</p>
<h2>Phonology</h2>
<p>This creole language was an amalgmation of aspects from various racial languages spoken in the Inner Sea. These included the merfolk tongue , sea elvish , the base tongue of the shalarin , the clicks and whistles of the dolphin language , and various constructions from Locathah , Kuo-toan , and Sahuagin speech.</p>
<h2>Script</h2>
<p>This language utilized the alphabet of Aquan , the language of elemental water .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Serusan was slowly developed over time by the various races of Serôs that lived under the reign of the Aryselmalyn Empire . Historians date its creation to around circa −3930 TS (−4000 DR) . After the fall of Aryselmalyr in −185 TS (−255 DR) , Serusan continued to see further use and modification by Serôsians, eventually evolving into its modern form.</p>
