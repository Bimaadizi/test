<p>The Jotunhammer Mountains , often labelled on maps as the North Jotunhammer Mountains , was a prominent mountain range that covered much of the western coast of Norland , an island within the Moonshae Isles . This range was separated from the South Jotunhammer Mountains by several miles of open terrain.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These jagged mountains were regarded as the "spine" of Norland. The peaks were separated by deep valleys cut by white glaciers. These glaciers were ancient and abundant, and often the only traversable path through the mountains was up and along their treacherous surfaces. These icy paths were subject to frequent convulsions and avalanches, and concealed many deadly crevasses.</p>
<p>The Jotunhammer Mountains were said to contain great mineral wealth, although this was more notable in the South Jotunhammer Mountains.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The mountains dominated much of central and northern Norland, with their western foothills ending just shy of the coast and the eastern foothills dominated by pines . They covered a distance of over 100 miles (160 kilometers), stretching from central Norland near the North Cape up the island's western coast to end at the northwest end of the island, where the highest peaks were located. On clear days, this corner of the mountains afforded a view far out across the Trackless Sea.</p>
<p>The mountains formed the entire western edge of the Frostfenn and served as a shield for the inhabitants of Norland's east (as well as the rest of the Moonshaes beyond) against the violent storms that blew in from the Trackless Sea .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , many dwarves came to Norland seeking to mine the Jotunhammer Mountains for riches, but found the risk of giant attacks to be too extreme. Many bided their time at Rogarsheim .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The glaciers and highlands of the mountains were ruled by frost giants , who only rarely ventured from their holds into the realms of the Northmen . The Northmen of Norland were known to treat these giants with great respect, seeing them as belonging to a similar culture. The Northmen were even known to leave offerings of food and drink along routes that the giants were known to use.</p>
<p>Beneath the southern mountains was an isolated colony of dwarves. Originally from Highhome , by the mid–14 th century DR, these dwarves had no contact with any outside groups, and no dwarf or human on the Moonshaes was believed to know of their existence. As of this time, the frost giants were engaged in a war with the last of the dwarves, and were close to driving them from their last caverns.</p>
<p>Amidst the tall peaks of the northern end of the Jotunhammer Mountains was one of the few aeries of white dragons in the Moonshaes. A family of about a dozen of these creatures had carved out caves and lairs in the ice atop these peaks. They were led by a massive and ancient matriarch who kept most of the family's hoard in her own lair, which was always attended by two adult dragons.</p>
