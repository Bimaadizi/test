<p>The Blade and Stars was an inn in Baldur's Gate on the Sword Coast of Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The long building was four stories high with an attached stable. The kitchens were on one side and the upper-room balconies were on the other. The rooms were tidy and clean. The front lobby hosted a small lounge where guests could meet citizens. Outside, the inn sign displayed a female hand clutching a lightly curved saber and several enchanted stars that twinkled softly. It was rumored the sign was plundered and purchased years ago from a raiding party in Amn .</p>
<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
<p>The inn was fairly quiet and sold drinks at moderate prices. Meals were served in guests' rooms rather than a dining room and consisted of regular ale , bread , and fish . The bread could be ordered with cheese or melted eggs. On winter nights, the staff served ruby cordial , a sweet brew of cherries dissolved in sugared red wine .</p>
<h2>Staff</h2>
<p>The innkeeper, Aundegul Shawn , hired several guards to turn away street rogues and thugs from entering the establishment. They were especially on the lookout for doppelgangers , which posed a growing problem in Baldur's Gate around 1367 DR .</p>
<p>About a century later, the Blade and Stars was run by the half-orc Aurayaun . After her sudden disappearance, it was taken over by her wife Lupin .</p>
<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>Local legend stated a female yuan-ti was trapped within the inn's walls, imprisoned while fighting a wizard . Rumors said she would finally be released upon his death.</p>
<h2>Prices</h2>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , regular patrons included G'axir the Seer and Elkart .</p>
<p>At some point during the 15 th century DR , the magical sign of the Blade and Stars was stolen. One Baldurian begger claimed that the thief was Aurayaun, the former innkeeper who had just recently gone missing.</p>
