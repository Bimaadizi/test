<p>Stirrups were a type of accessory for saddles , designed to help riders climb on to them and better control their mounts. They also enabled mounted combatants to put greater force behind their attacks and remain on their saddles when struck by forceful blows.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Stirrups typically consisted of leather straps that were attached to each side of a saddle by a hook and several ties. These straps ended in a metal foot rest, either in the form of a ring or a pointed cup.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>A stirrup was controlled with the foot. For example, Benelaius speculated that Kendra 's big feet helped her hold her stirrups well and ride better.</p>
<p>If a rider fell from the saddle, they risked getting their foot caught in a stirrup and being dragged on the ground or even beneath their mount, so they would try to free their foot when they fell.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Stirrups were not invented on Toril until after the fall of the Netherese Empire . The eventual introduction of the stirrup allowed the polearms known as lances to become prevalent weaponry for those on mounts. It was considered nearly impossible for a mounted fighter to charge effectively with a leveled lance without them.</p>
<p>The eventual introduction of both the saddle and stirrup in the land of Zakhara caused the vehicles known as chariots to gradually fall out of widespread use.</p>
