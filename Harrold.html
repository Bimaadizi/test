<p>in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Harrold, how wife Mrs. Harrold and their children traveled from Trademeet to Athkatla to visit a circus at the center of the Center District , in Waukeen's Promenade . Unfortunately, the circus tent fell victim to a mad gnome illusionist Kalah , who transformed the tent's interior into a fanciful tower filled with guests and performers, ensorcelled to appear as monsters. To the couple's disappointment and outrage, they were not allowed into the tent and ended up waiting for the crisis to reopen, despite the children losing any interest by that point. As they waited, the spouses witnessed a spell battle between archmage Jon Irenicus and Cowled Wizards that collapsed part of the amphitheater. Mrs. Harrold was terrified of the occurrence, while Harrold himself found it awfully entertaining. Harrold thought that despite the ride being awfully bumpy and uncomfortable, they ought to take the next carriage back to Trademeet, while Mrs. Harrold refused to leave until they were allowed into the tent.</p>
