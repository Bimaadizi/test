<p>A figurine of wondrous power was a small magical statuette ranging in size from that of a grown man's hand to the size of a little finger and similar in shape to the extra-planar creature that it turned into.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These rare items transformed into many types of bestial planar creatures that understood Common and followed the orders of the wielder of the statuette. These creatures were called by the name given to the creature upon the item's creation. They couldn't reside on the Prime Material Plane for large amounts of time and therefore were bound by the figurines to return to their home planes to rest after a set amount of time on the prime.</p>
<p>If the creature was slain while on this plane, it would revert back to statuette form and live on, but if the statuette was destroyed the item became worthless and lost all enchantment. Depending on the strength of the enchantment, this artifact's effects should be permanent unless passed through an anti-magic field, which could disrupt the base structure of any magic item.</p>
