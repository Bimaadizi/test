<p>Klonalogh Umesker was an inhabitant of the town of Mossbridges in the Vast around 1370 DR .</p>
<p>Klonalogh was the foreman of a corps of engineers and stonemasons paid by the civic authorities of both Ravens Bluff and Tantras to maintain the massive multi-span bridge over the Fire River in Mossbridges. They could never be persuaded to risk or sabotage the bridge.</p>
<p>However, they were corrupt in other areas. For a hefty bribe, they would conceal bodies, treasure, and telltale items in the bridge pilings, where they might remain for a good long time. Klonalogh was head of this operation too.</p>
<p>The foreman's office could be found three doors north of The Blushing Gynosphinx , past two rooming houses, on the east side of the road.</p>
