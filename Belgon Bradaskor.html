<h2>History</h2>
<p>Belgon Bradaskor had been a part of the underworld in Scornubel since approximately 1347 DR . The last summer before late 1357 DR , almost certainly 1356 DR , he had become acquainted with Tessaril Winter , who had sworded Ulbegh . Between that time and the next year, she informed him that Ornrim had died, letting him deduce that the person in that position was an impersonator.</p>
<p>Late in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Belgon was informed that Marlel 's ambush for Shandril Shessair had failed, and that she'd be joining Orthil Voldovan 's caravan. He arranged for Rendilar Bluthlock to hire some undesirables from the local criminal element, which would ensure their elimination. Rendilar would later die attacking the caravan, almost certainly implying the thugs were hired to attack the caravan as well.</p>
<p>Soon after, Lhaeo sent Sharantyr to find Shandril, and Belgon was named as the first person to seek out in order to find her. She began by luring in Besmer Altuth, a criminal, who attempted to rob her; after turning the tables on him, she force him to show her the way to Belgon.</p>
<p>Upon meeting him, Sharantyr managed to learn from him that Shandril had left with Orthil Voldovan's caravan. He had a horse and rations delivered to her so she could catch up as soon as possible, but after she left, he sent Tornar after her, with orders to kill her. He was informed some time after of Shandril's immolation and the caravan's destruction by Nesger . Tornar had later agreed to tell him he'd managed to slay Sharantyr, though he hadn't.</p>
