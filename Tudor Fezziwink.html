<p>Tudor Fezziwink was a scam artist, who worked with his cousin, Thurlow Fezziwink , to find a way to cheat at the dog track in Westgate on the Dragon Coast in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tudor was a young-looking male gnome with a light skin tone, brown eyes, and straight brown hair. Tudor was lean and wiry with darting eyes. He looked nothing like his cousin.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Thurlow and his cousin Tudor devised a plan to cheat at the highly guarded gambling establishment called The Track , located on Westgate's Market Triangle . The establishment was a dog track and bar. It was well-guarded, and the bouncers thoroughly searched all who entered, confiscating any items that could affect a racing hound's performance, such as potions of haste . But Thurlow concocted something he called a simple mixture of spices that could be smuggled past the Track's bouncers. The gnome spotted a group of well-armed adventurers on the street and chased them down to hire them for the simple task of bringing the vial of spices to Tudor, who was ready to pull the scam off from the Track's taproom to fix a race between Big Bruiser and Daleland Downs .</p>
