<p>The Inn of Wayward Sages was a cozy, but rundown inn found in the Northbank of Silverymoon . It was located on the northwest corner of the city block where Bowshot Ride met the Ghostwalk .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>While the inn's food was particularly tasty, its furnishings were old and far from comfortable. The whole building had a persistent chill that even a roaring fireplace could not fully alleviate.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time shortly before 1366 DR , the inn was badly damaged in a fire and had to be (at least partially) rebuilt. Yet again, between then and 1372 DR , it was completely destroyed in another blaze. After the second time the inn ran ablaze, it was completely rebuilt in the same location and renamed the Wayward House .</p>
<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>There were several local stories as to how the inn acquired its name. The most common explanation was that the inn was simply a favored rest stop for sages to get away from their studies and enjoy the tastes and talk of the town.</p>
<p>A more ribald tale was the persistent rumor that the inn was built and financed by the famously beautiful escort Meereldil Shorncrown . Her clientele, interestingly enough was primarily sages from the local magical colleges and devoted followers from the temple of Oghma . Lending credence to this story, Meereldil did spend her last days within the inn, and a woman by the name of Jhalessa Shorncrown did serve as chamberlain of the Wayward House.</p>
