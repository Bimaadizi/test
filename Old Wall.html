<p>"The Old Wall " was a term used to refer to those structures and streets occupying the area where the original walls of Silverymoon once were.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Old Wall began at the Docks west of the Moonbridge and went northwest to Dancer's Mask Lane , which it followed as it ran north. Then it bent sharply to the east until it reached the Market . The Old Wall served as much of the Market's western border until ending at the Docks east of the Moonbridge.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Construction of the original wall of Silverymoon was begun in 637 DR and completed by Uktar of that same year, when Silverymoon officially became a city. By 734 DR , the growing city was suffering from problems of overcrowding; new walls were built that nearly doubled Silverymoon's size. Sections of the Old Wall and its foundations were intentionally left standing to be used as supports for new buildings.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>Helmer's Wall , which used to be a gatehouse to the city within the Old Wall, was a popular tavern among students at the many colleges.</p>
