<p>Phalagars were rare, magical burrowing predators that emerged in the Underdark following the Spellplague . They had a widespread reputation for the violent attacks they perpetrated.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These monstrous creatures had squid -like bodies, capable of crawling through cracks and narrow tunnels. They had many long tentacles that were covered with small, acid dripping mouths.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Phalagar typically tried to slay a single prey and then drag it away to prey upon the corpse, though sometimes they would fight a group of combatants to the death. Their tentacles were capable of rending flesh from bone and used the acid they dripped to melt prey as they grasped them.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>These beasts lived solitary lives, lurking within large cracks, channels or wells that have dried up, or beneath the ground.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Other creatures sometimes lurked near the hunting grounds of phalagars, seeking to steal away their prey or pick off wounded survivors. Chokers were one of the creatures most likely to do this.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1479 DR , a mining operation conducted by the Festering Wound tribe within the Tannath Mountains attracted the attention of a pair of phalagars. A mage allied with them, known as the Saffron Devil , fought the pair. Instead of killing them, he chose to bound the pair to the area by means of a glowing symbol on the ground. Forcing them to guard the orc tribe and protect the area from further intruders until they finished mining out the area's menhir stones. Eventually, a group of adventurers came and fought off both the orcs and phalagars on behalf of the Cloudrippers tribe of goblins .</p>
