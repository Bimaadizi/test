<p>Acwellan was a lich in Myth Drannor , who dwelled in the Mages' Guild .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He was once a wizard trying to research how to gain immortality. His attempts twisted his body and turned him into a lich.</p>
<p>In the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , he was confronted by the Heroes of Waterdeep , who might've decided to parley with him or just attack. Either way, they were forced to fight him. After he was defeated and at the point of dying, the Dark God took away the Codex of the Planes , which Acwellan had carried. In his dying breath, he begged the adventurers to stop the Dark God. With the last of his energy, he teleported the adventurers near the Temple of Lathander .</p>
