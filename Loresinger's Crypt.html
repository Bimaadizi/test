<p>The Loresinger's Crypt was a small tomb, the final resting place of the bard and the Loremaster of Myth Drannor . The crypt remained unplundered until it was opened by the Cult of the Dragon in 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Loresinger's Crypt was located on the southern end of Myth Drannor's Polyandrium , close to the Candledance Way that connected Polyandrium to Myth Drannor.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Loresinger's Crypt was a small cross-shaped structure not bigger than 15 ft. on the inside and a carved stone door.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The tomb's interior was very obviously dedicated to a musician. The walls were painted with series of swirling musical note design and the stones were enchanted to emanate quiet music.</p>
<p>Each side of the crypt's interior had a small stone door that opened into small rooms. The center of the main room held an open-faced sarcophagus with the Loresinger's ancient brittle bones inside. Each of the side rooms was a small 5 ft. square alcove. One of the alcoved held a precious ancient book of elven song that was worth 1,000 gold pieces to scholars, bards, or collectors. The book's cover was decorated with delicate golden filigree and the holy symbols of Hanali Celanil and Oghma (heart and blank scroll ). Another alcove had a set of masterfully crafted music pipes and the scroll that detailed the creation of pipes of sounding . The last alcove chamber was empty.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Loresinger's Crypt was built long before the advent of the Weeping War that destroyed Myth Drannor. The titular Loremaster was interred in the crypt after his death before the project of creating enchanted pipes of sounding was complete. The tomb was sealed with the rune of harps and the word of power "sellatirll" that kept the crypt safe from looter, demons, and adventurers in centuries that followed after the Weeping War.</p>
<p>In 1369 DR, the Cult of the Dragon occupied Myth Drannor and ran excavations in the Polyandrium. The Loresinger's Crypt was one of the few tombs unsealed by the Cult after they discovered the words of power records in the House of Gems ' Room of Words. The Cult of the Dragon kept a single sentry in front of the crypt.</p>
