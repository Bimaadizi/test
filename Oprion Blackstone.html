<h2>History</h2>
<p>Oprion Blackstone was one of the priests that Elthaulin called on to seize control of the Citadel after Fzoul engaged in combat with Shandril Shessair .</p>
<p>After Shandril's last frontal assault on Zhentil Keep , causing the death of Fzoul Chembryl, Oprion impersonated Manshoon and sent a speaking stone to Eveningstar , which carried a message from him impersonating Manshoon to Shandril. In the message, he made the claim that the Brotherhood would no longer seek her spellfire . While scrying on the stone, he caught some of a conversation with Elminster . Then the real Manshoon turned up and told Oprion to get on with resurrecting Fzoul.</p>
<p>He later contemplated the possibility of ignoring Manshoon's coming request for parley after Shandril's death, only to be warned by local beholders that they would kill him for that.</p>
