<p>Phags-pa was a hare hengeyokai monk living in the forested Valley of Lo Chi in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Phags-pa was born to Notia T'ong , who acted as the guardian of his tribe against the cruel shukenja Ko Hung Cho and his monks from Lo Chi monastery , who over the years attempted to hunt the hare hengeyokai down and force them into working their mines. At some point, Notia T'ong he sent Phags-pa to go learn the ways of the Lo Chi monastery, as he knew almost nothing about them himself. Taking the form of a human , he did so, but was eventually cast out by them.</p>
<p>Later, around Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) , a group of adventurers from Shou Lung stumbled upon Phags-pa in a snowdrift while wandering the Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains in search of the fabled Flowers of Flame . When they found him Phags-pa's hands and feet were bloody stumps, his body having become frostbitten and lost a great deal of blood. Still clinging to life, Phags-pa told the adventurers his name, the tragic tale of his people, and warned them to beware of Ko Hung Cho and the fire spirit . His last words to them were to go find his people through a gate to the west. Following this, Phags-pa transformed into a hare and breathed his last breath.</p>
