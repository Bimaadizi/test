<p>Isti-Zar was a banelar naga follower of Cyric in the early 1370s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Doing the bidding of his dark god, Isti-Zar offered its aid to the Shar -worshipers involved in the black dragon Despayr 's plot to tear apart the Weave of magic in the early 1370s DR . Despayr distrusted the banelar, and sent it to the Shadowscale Warren on the Plane of Shadow , there to serve as advisor to Kossaandar , warchief of the Shadowscales , a tribe of shadowslain lizardfolk that served the dragon.</p>
<p>Eventually, in early Eleint of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , an adventuring party in service to Mystra likely discovered the Shadowscale Warren as they journeyed through the Shadow Swamp . Isti-Zar is presumed to have been defeated and slain in the fighting, if it didn't successfully escape into the waterways.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A banelar naga, Isti-Zar was a massive serpentine creature with a humanoid head, covered in thick blue-black scales with small barbel-like tendrils from its chin and a barbed stinger on its tail.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Isti-Zar was a cunning, dispassionate, and hate-filled being. It was quick to capture or slay intruders so it could impress upon the Shadowscales the banelar's might and intellect.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Isti-Zar provided its skills to the Shadowscales and advised Kossaandar on magic-related issues. It did so in good faith, at Cyric's command, at least for the time being.</p>
<p>However, Isti-Zar's main interest was in the process that turned living beings into shadowslain. It divined the secret of the Shadowscales' powers.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Isti-Zar laired in a water-filled chamber of the Shadowscale Warren, where it stored its possessions. It held a wand of magic missile , wore a ring of protection +1 , and had both spellbooks and a holy symbol of Cyric for its spellcasting. The banelar hoarded 580 gp in gold and silver coins, three pearls each valued at 100 gp, and also had a vial holding 1 ounce (28.35 grams) of stone salve .</p>
