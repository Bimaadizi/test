<p>The Adamantine Mug was a cheap tavern of great quality in the city of Athkatla in Amn , rebuilt in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The Mug's decor resembled a silversmith 's showroom. Its interior held numerous glittering railings, unnecessary decorations, and spreading leaf flourishes on sconces and fittings. The inn's seats in the most demand were its window tables.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The tavern was famous for its excellent quality, drinks, and services, all offered for refreshingly low prices. The staff treated the Mug as an exclusive club despite being open to any paying client. It perceived secrecy, respecting the privacy of the Mug's regulars. As business espionage was common at the Mug, all new faces were greeted with uncomfortable silence at the tavern. Buying the crowd, a drink was the only sure way to become a "friend," albeit temporarily. Those who attempted to negotiate business deals at the Mug were curtly asked to "seek the street" as the tavern did not allow business discussions of any sort.</p>
<p>For merchants, the Adamantine Mug was a place to be seen. Apart from socializing, the tavern offered excellently spiced cheesebreads , sea- salt and spice -flavored snail - mussel pâté , and a variety of alcoholic libations from its cellar, such as elverquisst . Nuts were served as a common bar snack.</p>
<p>Unlike many other taverns in Athkatla, the Adamantine Mug closed early, well before dawn.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Jaranatha Rylivvin kept a loaded crossbow under her bar stand, as well as a rope of entanglement and so-called flour-globes to be used on unruly customers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Adamantine Mug was established to cater to merchants and traders and quickly built a loyal regular clientele base. My the late 14 th century DR, the Adamantine Mug was rebuilt to become even more popular among local mercantile crown than before, under the ownership of Jaranatha Rylivvin and her silent partner Thuala Benflaeve . Jaranatha's two sons and a half-brother, along with a staff of ten individuals, ran the Adamantine Mug during that time.</p>
