<p>Liala a Northman queen of the Korinn Archipelago of the Moonshae Isles during the 13 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was an attractive woman with shining, blonde hair.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Her husband was the "Sea King" Viledel , and the pair of them aspired to rule over a great maritime empire. She was presumably the mother of Viledel's son, Prince Horedel .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Liala was born around the same time that Viledel established himself in the Korinn Archipelago, circa 1228 DR . She was about twenty years old when Prince Horedel died of disease , and was about forty when she was slain alongside her husband during a pirate raid of Viledel's Isle .</p>
<p>The bodies of Liala and Viledel were interred in the catacombs beneath the Manor of the Sea King by Keestake —one of Viledel's grooms and the sole survivor of the massacre —who laid their bodies alongside each other upon stone slabs, carved epitaphs in their honor, and babbled a number of desperate prayers over his fallen king. Unbeknownst to Keestake, Viledel was wearing a ring of wishes , which responded to the prayers by transforming both Viledel and Liala into undead creatures akin to zombies that did not rot or deteriorate. The pair of them laid patiently in this state, ready to slay any who dared to rob their crypt.</p>
