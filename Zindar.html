<p>Zindar ( pronounced : /ˈ z ɪ n d ɑːr / ZIN-dar ) was a half-dragon sorcerer and harbormaster of Port Nyanzaru in the late 15 th century DR . He was also a central member of the Ytepka Society .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He had an imposing presence that he liked to use to more efficiently diffuse disputes during the course of his job. He took pride in his work and his city, and had little patience for any who would bring harm to either. He kept his business honest, although he was not above retaliating against those who crossed him.</p>
<p>He tended to like adventurers , and was known to offer directions and welcoming words to new arrivals in the port. He was very knowledgeable about the goings-on around Port Nyanzaru.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He was a considerably powerful sorcerer, and made frequent use of magic to do his job: he used clairvoyance to quickly inspect ships' holds, detect thoughts for dealing with visiting ship captains, dominate beast to pacify nervous dinosaur beasts of burden, knock for inspecting closed containers, and message to deliver orders to his dockworkers.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As harbormaster, Zindar was responsible for keeping track of shipping manifests and for running the docks, including managing the traffic in the Warehouse District and dealing with the hundreds of minor disputes and problems that arose each day across the Harbor Ward . Doing so frequently meant that he was not present in his office , but messages for him could be left with his clerks. He would also seek the aid of adventurers to deal with threats or strange occurrences around the harbor.</p>
<p>He was well-paid by the city's merchant princes for his services.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, Zindar had permission from the merchant princes—specifically from fellow Ytepka member Zhanthi —to offer a reward of 2,000 gold pieces for the capture of the pirate ships known as the Dragonfang , the Emerald Eye , and the Stirge . He also offered 500 gold pieces for the capture of the captains of any of these ships.</p>
