<p>Brest was a warrior - priest of Bane who lived during the 8 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Brest was guided by visions sent from Bane to go to Zhentil Keep , where he would accept an open seat on the Council of Lords in the Year of High Treachery, 752 DR after Zhentar eliminated his rivals on the Council the previous year. Brest was unique among the new members of the Council for the fact that he was not a wizard . In the Year of Strife, 753 DR , Brest founded a new temple to Bane called the Dark Shrine and served as High Priest.</p>
<p>Following the deaths of Zhentar and Elephstron in 753Â DR , Brest worked with the wizards of the Council to conceal the true nature of their deaths by means of spells to prevent any form of magical divination from revealing the truth.</p>
