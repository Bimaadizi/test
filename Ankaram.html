<p>Duchy Ankaram , formerly Ankramir , was the territory of Tethyr bordering Calimshan in the south.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Ankaram was located between the River Ith and the River Memnon . It was bordered by the Sea of Swords in the west and the Forest of Mir in the east.</p>
<p>The region was sparsely populated but included several well-guarded forts along the border, so Calimshan was cautious about ever attacking it.</p>
<p>The duchy contained two counties, Calimmon and Monteshi , the latter of which included Monrativi Teshy Mir , an area of contention between Calimshan and Tethyr.</p>
<p>Ankaram was the location of two of the most dangerous adventuring sites of Tethyr, the ruined cities of Shoonach and Memnonnar .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR , Duchess Vajra Valmeyjar ruled Ankaram, officially from her castle of Maratimmir , 30 miles east of the city of Myratma .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ankaram was given to Tethyr as a gift in −150 DR by Syl-Pasha Kamus el Tarshaj of Calimshan.</p>
<p>Before the Tethyrian Interregnum , this duchy was known as "Ankramir". After Queen Zaranda Star rose to power in 1369 DR , Ankaram was considered a part of the Principality of Ankramir , which also included Kamlann and the Purple Marches .</p>
