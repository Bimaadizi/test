<p>Mount Or-Ghash was a peak in the northern Chigidi Mountains in the Plain of Horses region of northwestern Kara-Tur . Its western slope was a holy place to local lamas and the body of Or-Ghash Gol , who was considered to be the greatest high lama to have ever lived in the area, was interred nearby.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As a memorial to Or-Ghash Gol, one hundred caskets were placed along the pass to the mountain, approximately 100 yards (91 meters) apart. Only one casket held Gol's remains, but which it was was a secret known only to the high lamas dwelling on Mount Or-Ghash.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The mountain was visited often by lamas and pilgrims . It was expected that pilgrims make an offering such as a scarf ( khtagh in Chuchian ) on top of every casket. Strangely, each spring, the high lamas placed a new set of clothes in the true casket of Or-Ghash Gol, and each autumn they took them out again, finding them used, dirtied, and torn.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The high lama of Mount Or-Ghash was Torgoja P'a , who served for ten years as of Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) .</p>
