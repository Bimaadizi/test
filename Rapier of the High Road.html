<p>Rapiers of the High Road were enchanted rapiers created especially for larcenous purposes.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These rapiers possessed a +1 enchantment that made the blade more deadly and its aim more precise. Its keen blade could land devastating and deadly slashes and it produced acid that dealt additional damage with each landed attack.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The origin of the rapiers of the High Road was unknown, however, these blades' light weight and ease of concealment made them a favorite weapon of bandits who preyed on fat merchants and vulnerable travelers. One thing was known for sure – these rapiers were not created for noble purposes as whoever held such weapon received a larcenous gleam in their eyes with the weapon filling their minds with rich purchases and tempted the wielders to take the coin from others.</p>
<p>As of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , at least one rapier of the High Road found its way into the mega-dungeon of Undermountain underneath the city of Waterdeep . In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , one such blade could be found in the city of Neverwinter , sold by a scoundrel merchant Fibba in the Docks District .</p>
