<p>Zae was one of the tiefling refugees from Elturel , displaced after the city's Descent into Avernus in the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Zae was a dance-loving tiefling woman with red skin, burning yellow eyes, and black hors that betrayed her hellish Asmodeus bloodline. She had blonde hair gathered in a loose bun and she wore a green dress.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Zae and all other tieflings within were outcasted from the city of Elturel. The refugees began to follow Hellrider Zevlor , who led them west towards the sprawling metropolis of Baldur's Gate . The group was regularly attacked by goblins and eventually took refuge at the Emerald Grove within a community of druids . However, the tiefling refugees were waylaid by a goblin army – the Cult of the Absolute , that sought to capture or slaughter the group. Zae stayed with the group until the tieflings' fate at the fate of the Emerald Grove were decided.</p>
