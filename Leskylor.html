<p>Leskylors were winged tiger -like creatures native to Eronia , the second layer of Elysium .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A leskylor's fur was snow white with stripes of light blue. Its wings had white feathers and could reach a span of 30 feet (9.1 meters). Its razor-sharp, pearly-white teeth and claws belied a cool intelligence shining from its icy-blue eyes. Leskylors were sizable creatures that could reach a length of 10 feet (3 meters) and a weight of 700 pounds (320 kilograms).</p>
<p>The three-headed variety of leskylor was generally tougher in most respects. They could even survive decapitation; although the individual head would die, its neck would seal shut to prevent blood loss.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Leskylors favored the dramatic and mountainous landscape of Eronia, as well as its extreme cold weather and frequent windstorms. They generally hibernated in chilly caves during the warm summers and emerged to hunt during the winters.</p>
<p>Although generally solitary creatures, they were sometimes encountered in pairs. Leskylors were also occasionally known to team up with champions of good, serving as mounts or companions.</p>
<p>Leskylors spoke Celestial , Draconic , and the Leskylor language.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>They were fiercely protective of their guarded territories. Leskylors would fly out to ward off evil-minded intruders on sight, but would usually perform a warning pass before attacking. In combat, leskylors tended to swoop in on an opponent from above, blasting it with their frost breath before moving in to attack with their claws and teeth.</p>
<p>Three-headed leskylors could unleash three frost breaths simultaneously, blanketing a huge area in deadly frost.</p>
<p>All leskylors could innately cast blessed sight , cause fear , cure moderate wounds , eyes of the avoral , hold person , obscuring mist , and vision of heaven . Some leskylors could inflict their opponents with golden ice , ravaging them with icy crystals.</p>
