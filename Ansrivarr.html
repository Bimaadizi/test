<p>Ansrivarr was a large heavy-hafted greatsword , one of the six Cormyrean Swords of State , that originally belonged to Mondar Bleth . Its name is the elvish word for "memory". After Mondar's death, the sword was taken by Faerlthann Obarskyr .</p>
<p>It was used actively by Faerlthann and his sons, but beyond this it became a ceremonial sword, used only during coronations. Baerauble Etharr and Alea Dahast wove magical enchantments into the sword that made it very nearly invulnerable.</p>
