<p>The Aeltagarr was a sun elf sorceress and seer of the city of Lothen of the Silver Spires in Siluvanede around the 3 rd century DR . She was known to be kindly and possessing magic enough to rival Magisters , and she was revered as the most senior mage of the realm.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Aeltagarr was consulted by people of all races, who came to Lothen—the only place where other races were accepted in Siluvanede—to get an audience with her.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Flaming Forests, 224 DR , the adventuress Myrjala claimed to be a good friend of the Aeltagarr and to have seen in her scrying pool the forces of Athalantar using magic to burn forests and slaughter elves across the Northlands , even destroying the Halangorn Forest , in order to expand their kingdom. However, the Aeltagarr had not recognized the mage responsible. In a meeting at Morlin Castle , Myrjala, in magical disguise as the Herald of Tavaray known as Huntinghorn, reported this information to Highlord Falaeve of Siluvanede, but "Falaeve" was slain and revealed to be Ubriien Orlyn , Mage Royal of Athalantar, also in disguise and doubtless the mage responsible for the attacks.</p>
