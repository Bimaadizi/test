<p>The wakadoshiyori were an office of the shogunate of Wa . They were the fourth most important office in the hierarchy of the shogunate.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The wakadoshiyori were considered subordinates of the Council of Elders, called the roju . Between two and four officials served in this role.</p>
<p>Like all other positions in the shogunate, to be a junior elder was a coveted role, and only the shogun could approve such an appointment.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>These junior elders had similar duties to members of the roju but particularly oversaw the daimyo 's hatamono , or "bannermen". They also performed a miscellany of other activities, such as inspecting public buildings or supervising the appointment of staff and counselors to the daimyo.</p>
