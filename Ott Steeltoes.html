<p>Ott Steeltoes was the most competent smuggler of the Xanathar Thieves' Guild of Skullport .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ott was a renegade of the Ironmaster clan. He first worked as a pirate, but later was offered a place in the Xanathar's Thieves' Guild. He quickly accepted, liking the prospect of more power and a less dangerous life.</p>
<p>In the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , the reorganization of the guild (and the secret change of the guild master) gave him more freedom in his thieving operations, which Ott greatly enjoyed. He became good friends with Ahmaergo and the two dwarves often drank together.</p>
<p>Around 1492 DR Ott was the caretaker of Sylgar , the pet fish of the Xanathar .</p>
