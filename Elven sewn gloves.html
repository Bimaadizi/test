<h2>History</h2>
<p>After completion of construction of Seldarine's Hand circa the Year of the Thirsty Sword, 900 DR , the inhabitants of the citadel lived in a close alliance with the dwarves of Dorn's Deep . The troops of the elven citadel were outfitted with the best clothing, armor , and weapons created by the crafters of both peoples. By the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , the Seldarine's Hand had been ruined for centuries and came to be known as the Severed Hand. Several pairs of elven sewn gloves survived the ravages of time. By the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , these gloves could be found in the town of Targos of Icewind Dale , namely, in the hands of Elytharra Dinnesmore , the wife of Speaker Ulbrec Dinnesmore .</p>
