<p>Easting was a small town in the Western Heartlands , lying east of Iriaebor , whence it got its name. It was a fairly typical town of the region.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A small town, it comprised less than 40 buildings in the mid-1360s DR.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>In the 1360s DR, it was home to four or more well-known horse breeders, who had competitive prices and were kept busy supplying fresh mounts to travelers going between the Sword Coast and the Sea of Fallen Stars .</p>
<p>Thanks to its small size and nearness to the mountains, Easting became a meeting place for dwarf craftsmen and merchants from hidden delves in the Far Hills and Sunset Mountains . They sold their high-quality smith-work here, as well as the giant mushrooms they fried as a delicacy. Thus, Easting was also a good place to start making inquiries for those looking to deal with dwarven craftsmen or to communicate with dwarven communities in the region.</p>
<h2>Population</h2>
<p>The small town had a large non- human population, namely of dwarves. Visiting dwarf smiths and miners getting a meal or drink in town were a common sight. The dwarves of Easting were allied with the Bruenghor Clan of the Sunset Mountains .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Black Hound, 1296 DR , an adventuring party discovered a hidden temple to Malar in Easting and tried to take the Book of Fangs and Talons , a Malarite holy book. But they were discovered by the priest and quickly overcome by "a great horde incorporating of all manner of beasts", as survivors described it. The would-be thief was dragged away and eaten and the book retaken. Those who escaped returned the next day with mercenaries looking for vengeance, but found the temple abandoned.</p>
<p>Local sage Rulthaven sighted a star-spore fall from the sky in the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR , and land near Darkhold , several days' ride from Easting, and quickly went to examine it. However, it was discovered by a band of adventurers known as the Seekers , who were stricken by the alien spores. Aided by Rulthaven's treatments, the adventurers recovered in Easting over a period of several days, during which the sage visited the crater and eagerly collected samples of the star-spore for his research.</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the Bruenghor Clan of the Sunset Mountains tried to light a signal fire on Mount Burning Eye , as their mines had been invaded by drow . They had hoped to alert their brothers in Easting to rush to their aid. Unfortunately, their march to the peak of Burning Eye was cut off by Ciraxis and a group of ogres .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>Temple of Chauntea : Located on the central square of the village, the temple dedicated to the Earthmother was a large stone building covered in grape vines, roses , and old plaster . The building was open, with a simple altar standing in its center and a statue of the Goddess surrounded by lambs standing at the front doors.</p>
<p>South of Easting, near the caravan road, there was a knoll standing between two marshes, which became shallow ponds in the wet season. Scrub trees and duskwoods covered the knoll, but on the northern side, in a small hollow between some duskwoods, was a 40‑foot-wide (12‑meter) dome that was a refuge created by Maldiglas Turntower , a Magister of the early 1300s DR.</p>
