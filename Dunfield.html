<p>Captain Dunfield was a mercenary officer who operated throughout the Sword Coast region of the North during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Dunfield was considered a hardened and distrusting man who was somehow able to remain honorable during the difficult times in which he lived. He always did his best by the soldiers under his command and strived to serve the community at large.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He had a long-standing relationship with Dagult Neverember , Lord Protector of Neverwinter .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After Lord Neverember started the New Neverwinter movement and rose to power in Neverwinter during the 1470s DR , he appointed Dunfield as captain of the town guard of Helm's Hold and made the official decree of Protector's Law , stating that all spellscarred residents of the city would be sent to the Hold for treatment. While Captain Dunfield kept the peace in the Helmite city a new prophet of the Watcher named Rohini rose to great acclaim for her treatment of the unfortunate spellscarred. Some time before the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Rohini revealed herself as a succubus and the leader of the devil -worshiping Ashmadai . She gathered her Ashmadai cult followers and drove Dunfield and his soldiers out from the city, forcing them to regroup elsewhere.</p>
<p>Captain Dunfield rallied what soldiers and mercenaries he had at a small camp outside Helm's Hold, known as the Last Redoubt . They built siege weapons and marched on the city, initiating the Siege of Helm's Hold . In response, the Prophet Rohini and her cultists summoned scores of devils from the Nine Hells and rebuffed the assault, keeping Dunfield and the soldiers of the Neverwinter Guard out of the city.</p>
<p>After seeking aid from Sergeant Knox in Neverwinter, Captain Dunfield worked with some adventurers, including the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge , to reclaim Helm's Hold. He directed them to slay the imps , legion devils and hellfire warlocks that roamed the battlefield, and then rally with the beleaguered Brother Satarin stuck in the city.</p>
