<h2>History</h2>
<p>At the celebration of the birth of Goshukara Sadamoto 's third son, the Gorath disguised himself as Yin-king T'o to impress Lui-hsia Chih . After the party, Lui sent Nan-kuo and Yench'eng Tzu Yu to read the aura of the real Yin-kung T'o, finding nothing strange. That night, Yin-kung and the Gorath led an attack on the Many-Hued Peacock Society 's headquarters in Nakamaru.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Yin-kung T'o posed as a foreign merchant in the city, having all the mannerisms of a man not able to live outside of his country, always wearing Shou dress and speaking with a strong accent, but this was only a cover for his true work as a Royal Vagabond.</p>
<p>He led the ten-member cell in Nakamaru but received direct orders from the Gorath .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Yin-kung T'o prided himself on how he had resisted the "barbaric" ways of Wa .</p>
