<p>The House of Thawr , also called the Children of the Bull , was a tribe of enlightened Al-Badia found in the High Desert of west Zakhara around 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The House of Thawr lived within the southeastern region of the desert within the Pearl Cities .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>A recent exodus of tribesmen leaving for employment or adventure in the Pearl Cities left the tribe with 1,500 members.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The tribe raided border regions for horses and other supplies that they could not gain by trading. At first these raids were a minor annoyance, but the Pearl Cities began retaliating severely, prompting the tribe to consider retreating deeper into the desert for protection. Another viable option for the tribe would be to move north and seek shelter with the members of House Bakr in Tajar . The tribe's Sheikh was reluctant to approve these plans, speaking instead of a cleansing wind that would resolve their conflicts.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>Sheikh Ali al-Sadid ruled the House of Thawr in 1367 DR.</p>
