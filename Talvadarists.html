<p>The so-called Talvadarists were a collection of young wealthy inhabitants of Athkatla , assembled in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Talvadarists were inspired by a popular and enduring classic farce play performed by the Athkatla Crown Aflame theater: the Terrible Tale of Talvadar the Merchant . The youths imitated the aforementioned Talvadar the Merchant and paraded themselves draped in red robes similar to the character's garb. These Talvadarists believed that the only way to be happy was to ignore all dangers and unpleasantries of life, just like Talvadar the Merchant unwittingly did in the beloved farcical comedy. However, the most Talvadarists ever achieved were commotions and traffic disruptions on the busy Athkatlan street crossings.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Talvadarists first appeared circa the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR . They were also mentioned by Volothamp Geddarm in his guide to the Lands of Intrigue , published in the late 14 th century DR.</p>
