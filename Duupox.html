<p>Duupox was a morkoth member of the Arcanum of Olleth in Serôs in 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thanks to his skills, Duupox rose through the Arcanum's ranks until he became one of the apprentices of Arcount Axar Xyrl .</p>
<p>During the Twelfth Serôs War , Duupox participated in the Olleth raids on the Tower of Numos at Abydos . However, there he was defeated and scarred by the triton hero Keros the Wanderer.</p>
<p>In 1370 DR, Axar Xyrl allied with the aquatic elf tyrant Gantar Kraok and the arcount sent Duupox with Major Qyzal to organize am ambush against some surface dwellers who were enemies of Kraok.</p>
<p>Later, Axar Xyrl, together with Gantar Kraok, also entered the battle to help his subordinates. However, Gantar recklessly hurled spells that struck the morkoth and when Axar Xyrl and Duupox confronted the elf about it, Gantar insulted everyone in the place and teleported away.</p>
<p>Therefore, in revenge, Axar offered an alliance to the surface dwellers.</p>
