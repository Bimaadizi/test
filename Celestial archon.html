<p>Archons , ( pronounced : /ˈ ɑːr k ɒn z / AR-konz ) not to be confused with the similarly named elementals , were an elite group of celestials in the service of all that is lawful and good. Archons were wholly good and lawful and were consistently at odds with fiends of any kind, though they particularly despised demons .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The physical form of archons varied. Their unifying traits were their strongly lawful good outlook and some of their shared abilities.</p>
<h3>Types</h3>
<p>The archons most well-known to those on the Material Plane of Toril were lantern archons, hound archons, and trumpet archons. [ citation needed ] However, there were several other kinds of archons. Archons were transmuted from one form to another as they ascended through the ranks. From the lowest rank to the highest rank, they included:</p>
<p>Archons whose position in the hierarchy was not clear to scholars include:</p>
<p>Archons who fell into the ways of chaos yet still remained good entities became asuras .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Archons were peace-loving entities and hated fighting. Archons would never initiate combat, attacking only if provoked. One should note, however, that they were easily provoked by acts of evil and lawlessness, and their rage has been described as "vengeance itself." If at all possible, they avoided harming good creatures and instead used nonlethal attacks.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>All archons could see in the dark and were immune to harm from electricity. They were resistant to poisons and could not be turned to stone by magical means.</p>
<p>An aura always surrounded an archon that protected it and anyone near it from the forces of evil. When an archon was angry or in combat, the righteous menace of the archon was so strong that it could be felt. They were innately aware of their surroundings when on their home plane.</p>
<p>Archons could create a continuous source of light . They could teleport themselves at will. Archons were naturally fluent in the Celestial language and the language of devils . Most also spoke Draconic . However, they could communicate with almost any sentient creature using their innate magic, so in some sense, they could speak all languages.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>When in combat, an archon courageously faced its foes head-on, unless it was obviously unwise to do so, in which case, they would take what opportunities they could to even the odds using hit-and-run tactics.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Archons were native to the House of the Triad, and most lived on Mount Celestia. Others lived in the realms of the Triad deities.</p>
<p>As the primary inhabitants of Mount Celestia, each archon had a specific role within a hierarchical system. There was no jealousy among the archons. Each archon was happy to perform its duties. Over time, the lowest archons, the lantern archons, ascent to higher archon forms. Many lantern archons themselves are the petitioners of lawful good deities.</p>
<p>The archons were led by the Celestial Hebdomad , a ruling council of paragons , which were all tome archons.</p>
<p>Many archons served the Triad gods Tyr , Torm , and Ilmater . The good deities Cyrrollalee , Dugmaren Brightmantle , Eilistraee , Milil , and Mystra all had lantern archons in their service. Hound archons served the halfling god Urogalan . Archons of all varieties were found in service to the good deities Arvoreen , Berronar Truesilver , and Deneir .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Between −247 DR and −238 DR , an army of archons, led by then-new deity Tyr, marched on Jhaamdath and defeated Valigan Thirdborn .</p>
