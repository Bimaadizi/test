<p>The Cinnamon Dragon was the name given to an unidentified dragon or other kind of creature that appeared in Turmish in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was first observed, or first became common knowledge, in the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , when it appeared dramatically in the harbor of Alaghôn , capital city of Turmish. It was thought to have been unleashed or summoned by the mage Orlevan Blackhammer , for it wrapped its prehensile tail around his houseboat, carried it into the air, and obliterated it with its spells and lightning breath, with its ashes blown away on the wind. Orlevan was presumed slain in the act. Afterward, the dragon spat lightning bolts and summoned monsters at the crowds of witnesses that had gathered around the harbor—the monsters that didn't die on impact immediately attacked onlookers, quickly dispersing. The dragon itself flew away over the sea to the northeast until it disappeared from view.</p>
<p>Thinking it to be a new type of dragon, sages were eager to examine it or others like it to understand its nature, while alchemists wondered what benefits its body parts might have.</p>
<p>In the 1360s DR, the Cinnamon Dragon was spotted a number of times and by independent witnesses deep in the Orsraun Mountains west of the Perloush . It was commonly thought by sages and others that the dragon laired there, hidden from everyday view.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A large wyrm of terrible visage, its scales were brown like cinnamon , hence its appellation. It had vast bat -like wings and a long, prehensile tail.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>It could breathe forked lightning bolts and cast powerful spells known to include reverse gravity and a kind of summon monster spell that allowed it to spit living creatures.</p>
<p>There were different theories about its diet. Some wizards theorized the Cinnamon Dragon could change shape, and thus adopted the form of a horse in order to graze or even the form of a human so it could live among the Turmishans.</p>
