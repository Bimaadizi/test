<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Ian was the owner of the eponymous grocery shop located in the residential district.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>

<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Cockburn was in possession of, and possessed by, a strange artifact which he found in his cellar. When the artifact overtook him, the shopkeeper felt the irresistible impulse to kill. He usually satisfied this need on unsuspecting adventurers —but on one occasion killed his wife, which he was openly grieving.</p>
