<p>Fey spears were a variety of enchanted polearms created on the Sword Coast North in the late 14 th century DR that originated from Neverwinter Wood 's fey inhabitants.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>There existed three variants of fey spears , with +1 , +3 , or +8 enchantments that made the spearheads deadlier and guided the wielder's hand towards the target. All three variants dealt lightning damage in addition to piercing the enemy flesh and had a chance of dazing opponents with each successful attack.</p>
<p>Fey spears could be created from an enchanted spear and some fairy dust .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first of the fey spears was a powerful weapon created by a group of dryads and nymphs when the Spirit of the Neverwinter Woods was wounded in a crisis that took place shortly before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . This powerful fey spear was to be used to defend the fey's home in Neverwinter Wood. But before the dryads and nymphs were able to find a hero to protect the forest, the crisis was over, and the fey spear was discarded and forgotten.</p>
<p>Fey spears with a simpler +1 enchantment were forged by Master Blacksmith Marrok of the Shining Knight Arms and Armor shop of Neverwinter to help the heroes who sought the cure for the dreaded Wailing Death of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Later the same year, more powerful versions were created by Master Blacksmith Barun of Beorunna's Well to help the forces of Neverwinter stand against Lady Aribeth the Betrayer , who led a marching army of Luskan in the deadly but short-lived Neverwinter–Luskan war.</p>
