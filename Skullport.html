<p>Skullport , also known as the Port of Shadows , was a subterranean city located far below Waterdeep , within the 3 rd level of Undermountain known as the Sargauth Level . While rumors of this subterranean domain of villainy persisted throughout the surface world, few of its inhabitants had any knowledge of any points of entry.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Built on an ancient Netherese ruin , within an immense subterranean cavern, the shadowy port was a dark reflection of the City of Splendors above. Its structure was built in three tiers, interconnected by narrow catwalks and rickety scaffolding. Creaking houses built on stilts were haphazardly built in a dense network that formed a near shantytown.</p>
<p>Exact divisions between regions was a matter of debate, but Skullport was divided into four generally accepted wards: Skull Island , the Port , the Trade Lanes , and the Heart . Although no clear vertical boundaries existed, locals divided Skullport into three vertical tiers to aid navigation: the Crown, the Venter and the Dredge.</p>
<p>Although the cavern of Skullport was pervaded by dim light overall, it benefited from a variety of natural sources of illumination. Phosphorescent mosses and fungi thrived on the cavern walls, while veins of luminescent minerals and clusters of crystals emitted diffuse, multicolored glows that contributed to the ambient lighting. For stronger illumination, residents relied on conventional methods, including braziers fueled by charcoal , candles , torches , lanterns , and, on occasion, driftglobes , though the latter were considered a luxury beyond the means of most inhabitants. Additionally, some Skulkers obtained more unusual light sources from the Underdark , such as the luminescent larvae of fire beetles , glowworms , and various bioluminescent fish and amphibians.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Skullport was situated over 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) beneath the surface.</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>The portals in the cavern walls along the river Sargauth were said to have been established by Halaster Blackcloak himself.</p>
<p>Passage through the locks that separated Skullport from the sea caves of Waterdeep required permission from the Keepers . However, a talented mage could "piggyback" another ship passing through the portal at the same time.</p>
<h2>Climate</h2>
<p>Skullport's considerable depth and the presence of a substantial population contributed to a stable, moderate ambient temperature averaging approximately 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18 degrees Celsius). Certain establishments, such as Gyudd's Distillery and Thaglar's Foundry , produced significant amounts of heat. Consequently, residents living in proximity to these facilities, as well as to businesses such as bakeries, open-air kitchens, and smithies, typically experienced temperatures up to five degrees higher than the average.</p>
<p>Owing to its subterranean location, Skullport was largely insulated from surface conditions; diurnal cycles and seasonal changes had minimal impact on its climate. Temperature fluctuations related to seasonal variation rarely exceeded increases of three degrees during the summer or decreases of five degrees in the winter.</p>
<p>The subterranean environment of Skullport was characterized by high humidity, a result of the continual influx of salty sea air through the South Seacaves and the persistent seepage of mineral-laden water from the cavern ceiling. This moisture-rich atmosphere has contributed to the deterioration of many structures, which displayed signs of swelling, wear, and fungal growth on both wooden and masonry surfaces.</p>
<p>The residents of Skullport were similarly affected, often exhibiting a damp and matted appearance due to the pervasive condensation and dripping water. To mitigate these conditions, many inhabitants wore oiled leather ponchos and hooded cloaks for protection against the moisture. The pervasive scent of must and mildew was a defining characteristic of the city's atmosphere. Over time, it was possible to distinguish individual wards by their unique combination of mildew, trade-related odors, and the presence of general refuse.</p>
<p>Skullport required a consistent supply of relatively fresh air. The cumulative demands of several thousand inhabitants, along with the widespread use of fire for illumination, cooking, and smelting, would render the cavern’s atmosphere uninhabitable in the absence of effective ventilation systems. Approximately 60 percent of Skullport's fresh air was supplied via the South Seacaves, which connected directly to the Sargauth. In addition, an intricate network of subterranean pipes and channels embedded within the cavern walls served to extract harmful gases through a system of suction.</p>
<p>Minor contributions to the air supply were provided by the periodic opening and closing of gates along the Sargauth, as well as from a one-way portal to the Elemental Plane of Air . This portal, located in Whisperhaunt Pass , played a critical role in maintaining atmospheric balance.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The population of Skullport consisted primarily of immigrants who, as a result, tended to lack a strong sense of civic pride or collective identity associated with the city itself. Most residents continued to define themselves in terms of their places of origin and retained the allegiances tied to their homelands. While few characterized themselves as patriots willing to defend Skullport as their own, the community nonetheless shared certain common behaviors and social norms.</p>
<p>Inhabitants were generally private and reserved, preferring not to involve themselves in the affairs of others. Displays of curiosity were uncommon, typically arose only when potential personal gain, such as financial profit or an opportunity to improve one’s social standing, was readily apparent. This tendency toward discretion and indifference was not merely cultural, but was regarded as a prudent survival strategy within the often perilous environment of Skullport. Visitors were similarly advised to adopt this mindset during their stay.</p>
<p>Despite this, gossip was a favored pastime among the city's residents. While they were generally disinclined to intervene in unusual or suspicious situations, they readily speculated among themselves regarding observed events, criticized the conduct of others, fabricated stories for amusement, and expressed dissatisfaction with their own circumstances.</p>
<p>The typical Skulker embodied a combination of opportunism and survival instinct. Personal needs and desires were prioritized above all else, with greed serving as a predominant motivator within Skullport's social and economic environment. It was widely acknowledged among residents that trust was scarce, particularly in matters involving wealth or financial gain. This pervasive awareness of the competitive and often duplicitous nature of their peers contributed to a defining aspect of Skulker behavior: a pronounced sense of protectiveness, particularly concerning their own interests and well-being.</p>
<p>Residents of Skullport were notably territorial and highly protective of their possessions, which they had acquired while residing in what was widely regarded as one of the most perilous ports in all of Faerûn. As a result, Skulkers exercised constant vigilance over their belongings and remained perpetually alert to potential threats, fostering a pervasive sense of paranoia that was generally considered both natural and prudent in such an environment.</p>
<p>Distrust was deeply ingrained within Skullport's social fabric. Skulkers were typically slow to place confidence in others, and in many cases, they were themselves not regarded as trustworthy. A widespread understanding existed among the populace that personal gain often came at the expense of others, and many were prepared to seize any advantageous opportunity, even if it involved depriving another of their property. While this did not imply that all Skulkers were inherently malevolent, a significant portion exhibited traits commonly associated with moral ambiguity or outright wickedness.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The government of Skullport was notably unconventional, characterized by the absence of elected officials, hereditary rulers, nobility, or any feudal structure. To the casual observer, the city appeared to function in a state of anarchy; however, in practice, it operated with surprising order. More discerning visitors typically classified Skullport’s governance as a form of oligarchy, dominated by various competing power groups.</p>
<p>These factions, while influential, were far from stable. Alliances and rivalries shifted frequently, with governance emerging through temporary and often fragile coalitions of groups whose selfish objectives align for limited periods. No single faction maintained dominance for extended durations, and control was constantly in flux.</p>
<p>Despite this apparent decentralization of authority, the true power in Skullport rested with the Skulls of Skullport , magically transformed remnants of the original Netherese mages who settled in the cavern. Though the Skulls generally remained aloof from daily affairs, they retained absolute authority. When they choose to intervene, their will was final and unchallenged. Ultimately, Skullport functioned as a tyranny veiled in the guise of chaotic oligarchy, with the Skulls serving as its silent and unpredictable overlords.</p>
<p>As of 1479 DR most control over day-to-day activities was managed by gangs such as the Lowfellows or the Mandible . Within a few decades, Skullport came under the domain of the being known as Xanathar and became the base of operations for his thieves' guild .</p>
<h3>Law & Order</h3>
<p>Order in Skullport was largely defined by the preservation of the status quo, which was upheld less by formal law and more by a combination of fear, convenience, and apathy. Among the denizens of the city, this informal order is self-enforcing. Individuals tended to avoid provoking one another, motivated primarily by fear of collective retaliation.</p>
<p>Should a Skulker antagonize another, the consequences were rarely limited to a personal dispute. Such actions often invited the ire of every power group to which the offended party belongs, be it familial, racial, religious, mercantile, or secret in nature. The threat of unified and overwhelming reprisal from these interconnected factions served as a powerful deterrent, reinforcing the unspoken rule that maintaining the status quo was essential for survival in Skullport.</p>
<p>Skullport operated without any formal system of law; instead, order was maintained by the universal imperative to avoid drawing the attention of the Skulls. The Skulls were easily roused by significant disruptions, particularly those that interfere with trade or resulted in wanton property destruction.</p>
<p>As such, most Skulkers go to great lengths to uphold the status quo and prevent circumstances that might prompt the Skulls to intervene. Actions perceived as threatening to the city’s delicate balance often provoked swift and brutal retribution from the populace. Offenders faced mob justice in the form of branding, torture, maiming, or even execution, punishments meted out freely and without restraint, so long as a Skull was not present to witness or address the matter directly.</p>
<p>Any activities that drew the attention of the Skulls who would impose seemingly random punishments for minor infractions and enslave or destroy offenders for serious crimes.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>Organized religious activity was subject to considerable restriction and social disapproval. Although residents were no less devout than individuals elsewhere in the Realms, the expression of faith within the city was required to be discreet. Historical precedent demonstrated the dangers of overt religious endeavors; attempts by followers of lawful or good-aligned deities to suppress or reform the chaotic and often malevolent character of Skullport had repeatedly resulted in severe reprisals. On such occasions, the Skulls intervened, frequently inflicting significant destruction and loss of life. Those deemed responsible for provoking the Skulls were typically expelled into Undermountain or killed.</p>
<p>Religious groups seeking to establish themselves within Skullport must operate covertly. Dedicated religious structures such as churches, shrines, or temples were expressly prohibited. No public places of worship existed in the city, though some individuals maintained private shrines within their residences or attempted to construct concealed sanctuaries. These efforts, however, carried considerable risk; if detected, the Skulls and the summoned wizshades they commanded destroyed such sites, often killing any persons present.</p>
<p>Despite these harsh measures, the Skulls did not indiscriminately target religious figures such as priests , paladins , or rangers . Private expressions of faith, including vocal declarations and personal gestures, were generally tolerated. The Skulls' hostility was reserved for conspicuous religious acts, such as the turning of undead , public gatherings for worship, street healing accompanied by proselytization, and other displays that suggested formal or collective religious activity.</p>
<h3>Food & Drink</h3>
<p>More than half of the food consumed in Skullport must be imported from the surface realms. Due to the absence of natural light and arable soil within the subterranean environment, this includes all fruits, vegetables, and grains. The principal local food source consisted of fungi cultivated in small outlying caverns and various levels of Undermountain. These mushrooms formed the dietary staple for the majority of the population and were transported into the city for sale in its markets.</p>
<p>In addition to cultivated fungi, residents supplemented their diets through the exploitation of native fauna. Various subterranean animals were hunted and consumed, with certain species regarded as delicacies. Fishing was also practiced, particularly in the Sargauth, which was inhabited by a species of large, blind fish known locally as " gumpfish ." Although lacking in flavor, gumpfish were considered a nutritious food source. Furthermore, some Skulkers harvested sizable clams and shellfish in the southern areas of the Port during low tide. These shellfish, sustained by the abundance of microscopic sea life in the nutrient-rich underground waters, were capable of reaching considerable size.</p>
<p>To address the ongoing demand for meat, Skullport has established trade relations with Underdark races such as the duergar and drow , who supplied meat from their rothé herds. Rothé meat, while more affordable than beef or fowl, was characterized by a gamy flavor and distinctive seasoning qualities, yet it had steadily gained popularity among residents. Efforts by certain Skulkers to raise rothé herds locally had been met with limited success, primarily due to predation by various creatures inhabiting Undermountain.</p>
<p>The waters of both the Sargauth and Skull Pool were highly saline and, as such, were unsuitable for consumption by most races. The majority of Skullport's potable water was sourced from deep wells located throughout the lower levels of the city. In addition to these primary sources, some inhabitants collected limited quantities of water from natural seepage, which driped from the cavern ceiling or condenses on various structures. This water was typically gathered in containers such as pans, tuns, and barrels. However, the volume obtained through such means was minimal in comparison to that drawn from the wells and was frequently subject to contamination by undesirable substances, including mineral deposits as well as ash and soot generated by the city’s numerous fires.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<h2>Upper Levels</h2>
<p>The Heart was the easternmost part of the main Skullport cavern, opening from the Trade Lanes to the west to round off at the cavern's eastern wall. It was the primary residential ward and highest-class area of Skullport, and also contained some businesses. Like the Trade Lanes, the Heart contained three levels, but due to its higher ceiling, its upper Crown levels were higher than the upper levels of the Trade Lanes.</p>
<h2>Central Levels</h2>
<h2>Lower Levels</h2>
<h2>Skull Island</h2>
<p>Located south of Skullport proper, within the Sargauth River across the Murkspan Bridge , this small isle was a well-defended fortress.</p>
<h2>Other Locations</h2>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Skullport's history dated back centuries to a group of Netherese mages known as the Sargauth Enclave who settled in Skullport's cavern. These mages fashioned the Mantle , a mythal that protected their settlement. When Netheril fell in −339 DR the Mantle was ripped apart by wild magic which killed most of the inhabitants. Thirteen Netherese mages were absorbed by the magic and turned into disembodied skulls.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Angry Sea, 1148 DR Shradin Mulophor obtained permission from Halaster Blackcloak to settle in the ruins of the Netherese enclave. For several centuries Skullport prospered as one of the main trading ports of the Underdark.</p>
<p>However, in the late 14 th century DR just prior to the Spellplague a slaad named Azriim weakened the Mantle so that it could no longer support the cavern's weight and large sections of the cave collapsed. During the Spellplague in 1385 DR the Mantle shot off bursts of wild magic and then disappeared.</p>
<p>After the Spellplague, most survivors fled Skullport. At some point in the second half of the 15 th century DR a young explorer named Miriam Sequora began showing off chunks of mithral she claimed she found in Skullport's ruins. She convinced a small number of miners to join her and soon a few merchants and miscreants settled in the town. By the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Skullport had come under the control of Xanathar, who made it a haven for his namesake criminal organization . The businesses and shops in the city all came to him for protection, lest they be shut down permanently.</p>
