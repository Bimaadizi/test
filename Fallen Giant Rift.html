<p>Fallen Giant Rift was a crack in the earth within the Plain of Standing Stones in Anauroch .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Fallen Giant Rift was located east of the Tagorlar mountain range within the Plain of Standing Stones.</p>
<p>The rift was a crooked and branched canyon or ravine that stretched for nearly 24 miles (39 kilometers) and was more than three miles (five kilometers) wide in places. At a depth of several hundred feet (about a hundred meters), the floor of the rift was packed-down earth covered in thick grasses—a rare haven of life within the otherwise arid Plain of Standing Stones. Here lived long-horned antelope, sheep, and goats. A spring at one end of the rift provided water for the hidden valley, and this source of water fed several pools throughout the ravine.</p>
<p>Gold veins were found in some of the caves within the rift.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Living within caves in the rift walls overlooking the pools were hill giants . They would hurl large rocks down upon anyone coming to drink the water in their pools, and they kept the wild herd populations from growing out of control.</p>
<p>The giants adorned themselves in necklaces made from skulls dipped in gold and polished.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Fallen Giant Rift received its name from an ancient battle there, where a group of dwarves felled a huge, forty-foot-tall giant in a bloody fight to the death.</p>
