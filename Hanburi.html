<p>A hanburi was a type of helmet used in Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The hanburi was characterized by its uncomplicated design. It was typically crafted from hardened leather or lightweight metal plates. Designed to fit snugly on the head, some hanburi helmets only cover the crown and forehead, while others provided extended coverage to protect the ears as well.</p>
<p>These helmets were intentionally constructed to be small, lightweight, and collapsible. Due to their simplistic nature, hanburi helmets were affordable, mass-produced, and devoid of decorative elements, making them a popular choice among common soldiers.</p>
