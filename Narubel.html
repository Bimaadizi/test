<p>Narubel , which was also called the City of Seasnakes , was a small city found in northwest Thindol on the Chultan Peninsula .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Narubel was located in the far northwest corner of Thindol along the coast of the Shining Sea near the border of Chult , making it the most remote of Thindol's settlements.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The city was built into a series of sea caves that honeycombed the cliffs of a natural harbor.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>As of Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Narubel was an independent city-state ruled by yuan-ti representatives of House Sauringar . Pirates who preyed on the Shining Sea used Narubel as a home port. Any combined efforts from Lapaliiya , Tashalar , and Calimshan to put an end to the pirates never came to fruition thanks to agents of the Sauringar spread across those regions whispering words into the right ears of their Rundeen allies. The pirates sent tribute from every cargo they seized to the pterafolk of the Chultengar as payment for services rendered long ago.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Narubel was initially founded by Tashlutan merchants in Year of the Carved Cliffs, 29 DR , who were eager to plunder the riches from the jungles of Chult. Caravans flowed from Thindar to Narubel in order to bypass sailing around the dangerous waters surrounding Chult. This came to an end in the Year of Hounds, 293 DR , when House Sauringar assumed control of the city and their spirit naga allies from the Chultengar began attacking caravans. A long continuation of such attacks ended virtually all traffic to Narubel.</p>
