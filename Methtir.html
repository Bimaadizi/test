<p>The Methtir , an Untheric word for "Northern Plains", was the name of the northwestern shore of the Alamber Sea , in the Old Empires region.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Methtir extended east from the Riders to the Sky to the Alamber Sea. Those lowlands were mostly composed of wild woods and arid grasslands.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>For most of its history, the Methtir was the northern region of Unther . During the Spellplague of 1385 DR , most of the Methtir region was devastated by the catastrophe. After its foundation, the Methtir became the northern extent of Tymanther , as well.</p>
<p>During the Second Sundering , of Nightal 26 of 1486 DR , large swaths of the Methtir region were exchanged with lands of the equivalent region in Shyr , a continent of the world of Abeir , when the Untherans were returned to Toril . The Untherans quickly reconquered the Methtir, but were unable of retrieve their other former lands. As of 1489 DR , most of the reborn nation of Unther was located in the Methtir region.</p>
