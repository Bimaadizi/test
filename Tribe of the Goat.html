<p>The Tribe of the Goat was a nomadic group of Reghedman barbarians that dwelled within the tundra of Icewind Dale before becoming allied with archdevil Levistus and being spirited away to Stygia , the fifth layer of Baator . The Tribe of the Goat was said to have been dwelling in Stygia for thousands of years by the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Despite being permanently tainted by the lower planes , the Goat tribespeople were a lot like their Icewind Dale kin. They valued battle prowess and strength in combat above all else. However, these values were hardened and twisted under the whips of their fiend masters.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Tribe of the Goat's history was largely lost to the ages as well as the events that led to the tribe becoming bound to Levistus's service. Sages believed that it was the result of some infernal bargain that ensured the Reghedmen would spend "thousands of years" in hellish servitude. Leaders of the tribe still remembered their history and the tribe's original name. They claimed that the Tribe of the Goat was brought to Stygia during the event called the Netheril Gambit , after being caught on the northern lands claimed by Stygia during The Transference . The Transference also caught a number of frost giants , who eventually became known as Stygian giants , as well as remorhazes , mammoths , and snowy owlbears .</p>
<p>In Levistus's grasp, the Tribe of the Goat proved itself on the battlefronts on Avernus and, as a result, they were gifted with limited magical abilities that would allow them to rise in the Stygian hierarchy. As a part of Levistus's army, the barbarians became known as the Goat Raiders, or simply "justgoats."</p>
<p>In the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR , Levistus was among several malicious parties that became aware of the legendary artifact Crenshinibon 's resurfacing in Icewind Dale, following the war against the army of Akar Kessell . The archdevil dispatched many members of his justgoats back "home" in order to retrieve the crystal. Those hell-twisted barbarians who were sent to Toril celebrated the return and planned on eventually taking the frigid land away from their soft and weak kin.</p>
