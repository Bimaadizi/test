<p>A scroll of the Harpers was an enchanted scroll that bore the mark of the Harpers , the organization that gave the scroll its name. However, further encircling the four stars, harp , and crescent moon were twelve command words , each distinct and magically connected to a different, enchanted harp. Activating the scroll transformed nearby Harper pins into the instrument chosen.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>To awaken the magic held in a scroll of the Harpers , its wielder needed to speak aloud one of the scroll's dozen command words whilst simultaneously touching either the harp or the moon displayed upon the parchment. The presence of at least one Harper pin in the vicinity, up to 60 feet (18 meters) away, was also required. Despite this, if no such pins were within range, the magic contained by a scroll of the Harpers was not used up—it simply failed to trigger.</p>
<p>Presuming success, any and all Harper pins close enough to the scroll were turned into actual harps, an effect that could last anywhere between 2 to 24 minutes. These harps were not only finely tuned and masterfully made in themselves, but they also took on the form of a particular magical harp, with the choice of command word reflecting the sort of harp that the pins would become. The twelve possible harps created by a scroll of the Harpers were:</p>
<p>As exemplary models of their sort, any pin-turned-harp carried the full extent of the powers typically associated with the original magic item . Those created by a scroll of the Harpers , however, gained further abilities. For example, the enchantment placed upon the harps made them entirely weightless, even capable, if released in mid-air, of floating in place. This same magic also sustained the harp's music, which continued to sound out with only minor changes, as though its wielder was actively strumming its chords; if nothing had been played prior to letting go, the harp instead repeated whatever tune their wielder had last sung or played on any instrument whatsoever.</p>
<p>This ability to sustain its own music, however, was limited only to chords of a mundane nature. A harp created by a scroll of the Harpers would not repeat music that released further magical effects. Otherwise, the instrument would continue to strum on its own until touched by the one who initially let it go—or the scroll's power reached its end, whichever came first. The latter caused any Harper pins affected to return to their original form, and, though they might have dropped to the ground if left floating and unattended as a harp, they were entirely unmarred by the transformation.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>A proper scroll of the Harpers was difficult to create, for knowledge of the twelve, mystical harps—many of which were Myth Drannan in origin—was necessary, and only the most sagely of mages were familiar with them. The ranks of such wizards included names as renowned as Alustriel , Elminster , Khelben , Laeral , and Shambarin . It was, however, possible for a mage of lesser experience to create their own, albeit weaker and cheaper, version of a scroll of the Harpers . In such a case where said wizard was acquainted with only a handful of the dozen harps, they could create a scroll that allowed them to transform Harper pins into that limited selection, lacking the full variety.</p>
