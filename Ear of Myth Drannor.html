<p>The Ear of Myth Drannor was an enchanted monument that stood in the middle of the Nightingale Court in Myth Drannor .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Ear of Myth Drannor was a tall column-shaped stature that rose about 20 feet (6.1 meters) over the cobblestone plaza in the center of majestic and elegant Nightingale Court. The column started with a wider base, extended into a thinner shaft, and ended in a wide horn-like gapped top that extended on one side, vaguely reminiscent of an elf ear. The body of the Ear was decorated with arcane symbols.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Ear of Myth Drannor possessed limited sentience and responded to requests of the citizens of ancient Myth Drannor. The monument carried sounds, thoughts, songs, and words upon request, making them audible for the petitioner. When the monument was in idle mode, it emitted positive news, stories, words, and other similar sounds for everyone in the plaza to hear. The monument's function was to remember and convey pleasant things, bringing happiness to the City of Song's citizens. The monument spoke in a beautiful female voice.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the disastrous events of the Weeping War , the monument's enchantments were affected by the high-level spells and wild magic , making it emit constant sounds of whispers in countless voices and languages.</p>
<p>The magic that allowed the monument to record and replay happy tidings instead recorded death and suffering since the War. In 1369 DR , a group of heroes, the Veiled Ones , used the monument to bring them words and memories of powerful artifacts hidden in the ruined city. Before the heroes departed, the Ear caught and played the new verse of the prophetic Song of Faerûn .</p>
