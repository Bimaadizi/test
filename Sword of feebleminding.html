<p>A sword of feebleminding was an enchanted sword during the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>There were no visible unique identifiers to the sword of feebleminding ; presumably, as it was thrust by an inexpert wielder through a competent warrior, the sword must have been of a type suitable for thrusting.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Upon striking, the sword of feebleminding presumably afflicted the target with the eponymous spell, feeblemind .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Red wizard of Thay Roeblen employed a sword of feebleminding of his own creation against Alustriel Silverhand in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR as a surprise weapon; he struck it right through her belly. Unaffected by its special powers, she sundered the sword immediately after.</p>
