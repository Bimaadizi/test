<p>Stormshore Street was a bow-shaped street that ran across Heapside and Brampton districts of Baldur's Gate .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Stormshore Street began on the northernmost part of the Gray Harbor , where the Eastern Wet ran alongside the riverside docks. Just a single block southeast of the street's beginning, it crossed Bindle Street and moved towards the city's eastern walls, passing Sorcerous Sundries and the Murl's Rest plaza in front of it. Then the street took a turn and ran parallel to the eastern city walls, just one block away from them, slowly curving towards the Gray Harbor while crossing Talankar's Lane and passing the Manycoins House , crossing the Fox Bottom moot, Nuthkhal's Way , and ending at the Stormshore Street Dock .</p>
