<p>A handglyph of the monolith was a powerful handglyph used by the Geomancers of Kadar to summon a fearsome earth monolith .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These items summoned a powerful earth monolith which served the wielder for up to nine hours. The summoned earth monolith would be strongest if the substrate of the surrounding area was composed of clay, mud, or earth. A weaker earth monolith would be summoned if the substrate was sand or rough stone. A substrate of worked stone would prevent the monolith from appearing. The summoning area had to be at least 20 square feet (1.9 square meters) with a volume of 20 cubic feet (0.57 cubic meters).</p>
<p>The wielder had to maintain solid focus in order to control the earth monolith, preventing them from performing any other actions.</p>
<p>Most handglyphs of the monolith had 1—3 charges and could only be used once per week. There was no known way to recharge them.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These items could be found in a variety of shapes and sizes.</p>
