<p>These katanas were originally fashioned by the great Kara-Turan artificer Master Hu Li , who was little known in Faerûn.</p>
<p>By 1372 DR , a number of these katanas began to turn up in the stores of weapons-dealers in northwest Faerûn . The first was considered to be a unique example of sword-making, but more swords appeared, all connected to a ship that had run aground on the Sword Coast of Faerûn some years before. Okuzo's Imports in Westgate carried a wide selection of items from the eastern nations, including Master Li's Way katanas.</p>
