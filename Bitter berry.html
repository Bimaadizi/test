<p>Bitter berry was a type of plant found in Faer√ªn . As the name suggested, the berries were small and bitter, but were edible.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The ranger Megan Arrowroot planted bitter berries in the Verdant Caves of the Whispering Caverns , so that the Guild of Underdark Guides could eventually use them as a local food source. This came in handy later when hostile drow started capturing the guides, prompting the Guild to gather emergency supplies on the spot for an operation to recover them.</p>
