<p>Nolzur's marvelous pigments was a magic item that enabled an artist to create real things out of paintings.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When placed upon an artist's paintbrush , these pigments flowed from the brush to create a real item based upon whatever the wielder concentrated upon. This process took ten minutes. A single pot of this magical pigment had enough material to create up to 1,000 ft³ (28 m³) over a 100 ft² (9.3 m²) area.</p>
<p>Only mundane inanimate objects could be created with this pigment, including all manner of food, and acted as expected. Alchemical items could also be created, such as tanglefoot bags . However, magic items and creatures could not be created, regardless of whether they were mundane creatures, magical creatures, or constructs such as golems . Plants, such as flowers and trees , could also be depicted. Following the Spellplague , copies of Nolzur's marvelous pigments lost the power to create plants, but regained the power to do so following the Second Sundering .</p>
<p>If objects with any significant value were depicted, such as gems , jewelry , ivory , or so on - the item would look authentic and maintain the appearance of luxury, but be made of more inexpensive materials such as bone, brass , lead , tin , etc. Following the Second Sundering, it was found that this stipulation applied to objects that were valued roughly over 25 gold pieces .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nolzur's marvelous pigments originated on the world of Oerth , created by the alchemist Nolzur . They were introduced to Toril sometime around the 900's DR by the planewalking archmage Alzennak , who was so fascinated by their potential that he recreated the formula necessary to produce more of them. The archmage would then spend much of his life further tinkering with the formula, creating the lesser known variant Alzennak's marvelous pigments . By the mid-14 th century DR, about 5% of all instances of Nolzur's marvelous pigments on Toril were actually instances of Alzennak's variant.</p>
