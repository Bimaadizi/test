<p>Nimbaud was the highest-ranking member of the Zhentarim left in Zhentil Keep during late 1368 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nimbaud chose to remain in Zhentil Keep in 1368 DR when Manshoon , sensing Cyric 's plan, decided to relocate most of the Zhentarim, himself included, to the Citadel of the Raven . Nimbaud, hoping to impress the senior wizard, volunteered to remain behind to control the situation and command a small group of Zhentarim wizards. Thus the Zhentarim could say that they had not abandoned the Keep.</p>
<p>On Marpenoth 29 of 1369 , Nimbaud helped the high cleric Fzoul Chembryl to bind the pit fiend who was impersonating Orgauth , the wizard believing they would soon inform Manshoon of their discovery. Instead, Fzoul and Abarax slew Nimbaud, established Orgauth/Abarax on the Council of Lords and appointed him as Lord of Zhentil Keep. Nimbaud was replaced by a baatezu to prevent his death from disturbing day-to-day operations within the keep.</p>
