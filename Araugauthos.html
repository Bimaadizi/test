<p>Araugauthos , called the Bluetalon , was an old blue dragon that was imprisoned in the ruins of Undermountain by Halaster Blackcloak .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Araugauthos and her mother Iryklathagra had a genuine love and affection for each other.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point in her life, Araugauthos was kidnapped and imprisoned in Undermountain by the Mad Mage Halaster. Iryklathagra suspected that the reason for Halaster's imprisonment of her daughter dated back to when she herself was a wyrmling and looted an abandoned tower that belonged to the Mad Mage in 150 DR .</p>
<p>During Halaster's Higharvestide in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Araugauthos escaped her imprisonment. Shortly after, Citadel Amnur in Amn was attacked by an unknown red wyrm , and Araugauthos came to the rescue by ripping through its wings with her claws, causing it to fall to its death and become impaled on sharp rocks. Araugauthos questioned the Captain of the Citadel Arilan Krimmevol for news of Faer√ªn since her imprisonment and left after two tendays, taking most of the treasure from the lair of the red wyrm. She then traveled to the lair of her mother, Iryklathagra, in the Small Teeth where she aided in the defense of the lair and acted as a decoy to would-be dragonslayers. Her mother rewarded her well for the service and the two got along very well.</p>
