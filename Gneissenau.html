<p>Gneissenau was a Netherese arcanist , alchemist , and guildmaster of the Miners' League in Eileanar until its destruction in 3520 NY (−339 DR) .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Gneissenau managed the Miners' League with the assistance of Lebreton , Philo , Jackson , Wackernagel , Ochsenbein as their hundreds of members located ore deposits, mined them, and extracted the metals.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 3515 NY (−344 DR) he developed a procedure that allowed for the processing of gold from raw ore to completely pure metal. First, mercury was poured over the ore, which caused it to form an amalgam with the gold and separate it from the other substances. The mercury-gold mixture was then pulled into a storage tank via the suction of a portal to the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Vacuum that was blocked by a screen. It was then transferred into a new chamber where it was heated using a portal to the Elemental Plane of Fire , causing the mercury to boil, separate, and evaporate into a final chamber chilled with a portal to the Para-Elemental Plane of Ice where it condensed into a usable form again. The boiling chamber thus contained the pure gold, completely separated from any impurities.</p>
