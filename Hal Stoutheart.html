<p>Hal Stoutheart was a dwarven explorer who perished in the depths of Tethyamar while searching for the jewels of ardor . Though long dead, his likeness was later used by the demon lord Graz'zt in a cruel scheme.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hal's last venture was into the lost mines of Tethyamar, where he searched for Blue Stone Cavern and the jewels of ardor . His eagerness proved the end of him, as he slipped and fell a great distance into the depths below the Eastern Reaches , breaking bones in the process. He came to a halt in the Blue Stone Cavern, but found that the jewels he sought were hardly the treasures he had heard them as. Unable to escape on his own, Hal found his peace in the soft blue glow of the jewels of ardor and wrote a final journal entry for his cousin to hopefully one day find.</p>
<p>Though Hal died in that cavern, years later the demon lord Graz'zt came across his remains and used his persona and the jewels for a malevolent trick. By pretending to be Hal and imbuing the jewels with an intoxicating demonic luster, Graz'zt lured a great number of dwarves to Tethyamar, where they established the Tethyamar Mining Outpost and began mining the worthless crystals. Only after narrowly surviving a war with the drow of House Argith and overcoming Graz'zt's final challenges did a team of adventurers sent by Inger and Asta find Hal's remains and his journal, confirming that the expedition had been a disaster from the start, but also clearing Hal's name of any wrongdoing.</p>
