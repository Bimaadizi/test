<p>Eyes of shadow were beholders that had been warped by too much time spent in areas connected to the Shadowfell .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>These creatures delighted in arousing fear in their victims.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>An eye of shadow possessed four different eye-beam abilities. Their central eye could induce fear in their enemies. The abilities of their other eye beams included a ray of radiant energy that temporarily blinded their foes, a deafening ray of thunderous sound, and a ray of necrotic energy that temporarily immobilized those hit by it. In addition, those hit by this shadowbond ray were unable to see an eye of shadow or other shadow creatures that were close by.</p>
<p>Due to being tainted by the Shadowfell, these creatures were also very stealthy and could make themselves appear invisible in areas of darkness.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Like all beholders, these creatures fought by means of their eyebeams and toothy maws. They spent a lot of time hiding in the shadows, waiting for their foes to be overcome by the tension before striking.</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>Whenever the Dreamheart opened its eye, an eye of shadow was one of the creatures that would potentially be summoned by it.</p>
