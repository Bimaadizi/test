<p>The Doffed Cloak was the sole festhall in Halfhap .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Doffed Cloak had a dance floor and adjoining bar, as well as many comfortable private rooms. The Captain of Halfhap's Garrison, Perrin Clovenshield , gave strict orders to his Purple Dragons not to overindulge or cause a ruckus, so it was surprisingly free of off-duty soldiers. It was instead mainly attended by locals, traveling merchants, and adventurers .</p>
