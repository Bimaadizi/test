<p>The Argent Legion was the state army of Luruar .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Formed in an attempt to ensure the safety of the smaller settlements of Luruar, the Argent Legion's forces were drawn from the various armies maintained by the more powerful city-states of that nation. Its purpose is to patrol Luruar's territory and garrison its settlements.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>Based in Rauvinwatch Keep, which stood roughly 15 miles west of Silverymoon , the legion maintained a force of 400 troops (mostly dwarves) who spent their time either training or going out on patrols with the Knights in Silver . The other half of the Legion were stationed in or around Citadel Felbarr (100 dwarves, 100 Knights in Silver ) and Sundabar (200 soldiers), which had both seen heavy fighting prior to the formation of the Legion. A force of 50 Legionnaires were also stationed in Jalanthar as it was a frequent target for orc and Uthgardt raids.</p>
<h2>Membership</h2>
<p>Any member of Luruar's various official state military forces could be transferred into the Legion. Many cities chose to send their barely-trained new recruits to maintain their commitment to the force while not losing their own veterans. In 1372 DR the group numbered 850 soldiers - 200 Knights in Silver (Silverymoon), 250 Iron Guard ( Citadel Adbar ), 200 Shieldsar (Sundabar), 50 dwarves each from Citadel Felbarr and Mithral Hall , and 100 archers & cavalry from the Army of the Vale ( Everlund ).</p>
<h2>Leadership</h2>
<p>Methrammar Aerasumé was appointed High Marshal of the Legion by his mother, Alustriel Silverhand . An able warrior, Methrammar was an excellent drillmaster whose training regimen turned green youths into elite warriors.</p>
<p>The High Marshal of the Legion was considered the seventh member of the Nine Peers council that governed the League of the Silver Marches .</p>
