<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Molar was an aging human with gray hair and impressive musculature of a hard-working smith.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the 1360s DR , Molar ran two shops, Molar's Artful Armourer and Molar's Very Well-Equipped Voyager . They're their doors right next to each other with Very Well-Equipped Voyager door to the south and Artful Armourer to the west. Each of the shops had a sign with its name. However, once a customer entered either door, they quickly realized that both doors led to a single. Molar's home could be accessed from the back of the shop, and it had a second entrance at the back of the building.</p>
