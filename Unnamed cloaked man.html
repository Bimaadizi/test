<p>A cloaked man , who signed his messages as "a friend" , was an unnamed agent active in Neverwinter in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the Siege of Neverwinter in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the cloaked man worked for an unidentified power in Neverwinter who desired for people to resettle the devastated Blacklake District . To this end, he worked to disrupt and eliminate the gangs that plagued it, the Nashers and the Dead Rats , by turning them against each other. He hired a rogue adventurer to raid a Dead Ratsâ€“held house, kill the wererats , and Nashers propaganda pamphlets by a bedroll to make it appear that a double agent was behind it.</p>
<p>Later, in Neverdeath graveyard, he asked a rogue to recover a Lucanis family heirloom from Gorim Tomb-Raider .</p>
<p>Finally, the cloaked man learned of a plot to assassinate Lord Dagult Neverember , by a group better equipped than the Nashers. Resolving to deal with it quietly to avoid embarrassing the city's ruler, the cloaked man located their hideout in Protector's Enclave and hired an adventurer to enter through a window and defeat the conspirators.</p>
