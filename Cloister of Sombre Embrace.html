<p>The Cloister of Sombre Embrace was a Sharran temple located beneath the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Sharrans operated a false house of healing on the surface called the House of Grief and used it as a cover. The actual structure of the cloister was hidden beneath the house to avoid public attention.</p>

<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Under Mother Superior's control, the Cloister of Sombre Embrace made money by collecting donations, book sales, and selling of the extracted memories. Its expenses included purchasing of supplies, bribery, informant fees, and purchasing of poisons and other rare substances. Mother Superior Viconia De Vir was unhappy with low income and demented that Shar was given more than scraps. Were the church to fail at boosting the income, Viconia would have the responsible parties replaced.</p>
<p>A special membership titled the "Friends of the House of Grief" was available to wealth patrons via applications. The donation tiers ranged from humble to staggering amounts. Each tier offered various benefits to the "Friends," from being thanked in the published works, and simple calming tonics, to honorary plaques at the temple, and even complementary Unburdening rituals.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
