<p>Whitkeep was a district in the Outer City of Baldur's Gate . It neighbored the districts of Norchapel and Sow's Foot , though the exact borders of each region were regularly debated.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The neighborhood was home to a sizable community of gnomes , many of whom worked as tinsmiths within the city.</p>
<p>As with many Outer City districts, Whitkeep had a problem with gang crime. The group known as Ganthall's Gallants regularly stole from Whitkeep's residents, but never targeted women.</p>
