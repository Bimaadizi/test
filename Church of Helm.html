<p>The Church of Helm was the organized collective of clerics , paladins , fighters , guards and other martial protectors, who dedicated their service to the god of vigilance, Helm . They dedicated themselves to the protection of those who could not protect themselves and shared their skills and tenets with the guardians and defenders of Faerûn , and beyond.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The church of Helm was organized into a strict military hierarchy. The Supreme Watcher was the single highest source of authority within the church, though it remained vacant since the 10 th century DR .</p>
<p>The Council of Helm , composed of four Archancels, oversaw Helmite activities up until the late 15 th century. Each Archancel took charge over the clergy in one of four broad territories of Faerûn , including:</p>
<h3>Factions</h3>
<p>While not an official arm of Helm's church per se , there was a group known as the Eye of Justice that worshiped Helm alongside the deities Tyr and Torm . This belief was known as the Heresy of the Threefold God . [ page needed ]</p>
<h3>Titles</h3>
<p>Circa the late 14 th century DR , titles within the church included (in descending order):</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century, the church's titles had changed to:</p>
<h3>Nomenclature</h3>
<p>Clergy of the church were formally referred to as Vigilators or Hands of the Vigilant One.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Following the Time of Troubles they set out to win back favor among the people of Faerûn with renewed demonstrations of excellent and loyal service as protectors. The church sponsored the training of guards and armed escorts in various cities throughout the realms, extolling their virtues and worthiness as the only guardians that were worthy for hire. Anyone found violating Helmite protectorship by slaying one of his faithful were often blacklisted from enlisting the church's services.</p>
<p>The clergy of Helm would take in anyone who sought sanctuary within the walls of their fortified churches, persecuted and criminally accused alike. Those running from the authorities would be turned over to local law enforcement, though the presiding Helmite priest would ensure a fair and just trial.</p>
<h2>Rituals</h2>
<p>One of the holiest of the Helmite rituals was the consecration of a Postulant , performed upon the confirmation of a person's dedication as they entered into the ranks of the Helmite clergy. Others included the consecration of a Glymtul , was used to dedicate items into service unto Helm; the purification, a ritual of atonement when clergy returned to the faith after leaving its service, or otherwise failed in their duties; and the Holy Vigil , a night-long ceremony was performed by a priest of Helm when they ascended in rank within the church.</p>
<p>Helmite priests prayed for their spells either in the morning or at night, soon after waking or shortly before bed.</p>
<h2>Celebrations</h2>
<p>The faithful of Helm celebrated their devotion with the Ceremony to Honor Helm on Shieldmeet . They held no other annual observances or holidays.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The church of Helm was a strong, protective presence throughout the North . They were oft regarded as the region's first defenders against attacks from monstrous beasts and malevolent humanoids .</p>
<h3>Regions</h3>
<p>Veneration of Helm was prevalent across Faerûn, including the realms of Chessenta , Cormyr , the Dragon Coast , the Silver Marches , Tethyr , Thay , the Vilhon Reach , and the Western Heartlands .</p>
<p>The Helmlands of Cormyr were named after the god Helm. It was a troubled and tarnished landscape, permeated with wild magic , and dead-magic zones , having been the site where Helm slew the avatar of Mystra during the Time of Troubles . In fact the Cormyrean Helmlands was a side effect of the appearance of the Guardian's Tear , the manifestation of Tyr's sorrow and grief for killing the Goddess of Magic. This stretch of perilous landscape was one of a number derisively referred to as "The Legacy of Helm".</p>
<p>Helm's reach extended far beyond Faerûn, to the nation of Payit on the continent of Maztica , and even other worlds beyond Toril 's crystal sphere .</p>
<h3>Temples</h3>
<p>Temples of Helm were imposing fortresses, whose architecture stressed defense and defendability. They were often built in Faerûn's most dangerous regions, or near its strongholds aligned with malevolent forces, (such was the case with Darkhold near the Sunset Mountains ). Within their halls were a number of barracks, armories, training grounds and, within the heart of each temple, a central altar with a suit of pristine full plate mail. Each of these sets of armor had been worn by one of Helm's champions throughout history, and were considered among his holy relics .</p>
<p>Each temple was extremely well-defended; Helmite guards remained ever-vigilant to protect their holy houses. To aid in this feat, the church often enlisted the aid of spectators , a sub-species of even-tempered beholder -kin.</p>
<p>Most major cities throughout the Realms had a temple or abbey dedicated to the Watchful One. Among these were:</p>
<p>Additional temples could be found in Alaghôn , Berdusk , Bezantur , Elturel , Fort Beluarian , Hlondeth , Hluthvar , Lheshayl , Procampur , Reth , Sundabar , Teziir , Tilverton , the Hillfort of Torbold , Tsurlagol , Velen , and Waterdeep .</p>
<p>In addition, shrines to Helm could also be found in many major cities, such as Arabel , Baldur's Gate , Cedarspoke , Eshpurta , Espar , Ironfang Deep , Lachom , Mimph , Ormpetarr , Surkh , Tasseldale , and Telpir .</p>
<h2>Equipment, Spells, and Relics</h2>
<p>Helmite faith tokens allowed their bearers to utilize the spell virtue .</p>
<p>Within the Dungeon of Methegrist were two small fountains of shimmering water, referred to as the tears of Helm . This substances had renewing restorative properties and could provide illumination in dark spaces.</p>
<h3>Dress</h3>
<p>Clerics of Helm were armored in pristine full plate mail, often enchanted with the everbright property, complete with open-faced helmets that often featured colored plumes. Over their armor they typically carried steel-colored scabbards, wore red or steel-grey cloaks, with Helm's symbol, the "Unsleeping Eye". While and church members donned their armor in the field and during church ceremonies, if found themself in a venue where armor was not allowed, they often kept their pauldrons and always wore their helm. Due to its inherent functional use, Helmite clerics often wore their ceremonial armor on the battlefield as well.</p>
<p>In the south , Helmite clergy inset their finely-crafted armor with gems and adorned its lining with gold filigree, particularly around the lids of the eye.</p>
<h3>Weapons and Arms</h3>
<p>When preparing for battle, a Patriarch of Helm often used a ceremonial mace to anoit troops in holy water , referred to as the "Tears of Helm".</p>
<h3>Spells</h3>
<p>Spells unique to or otherwise associated with the church of Helm included exaltation , faith armor , fist of faith , forceward , mace of Odo , seeking sword sentry of Helm , shield of the god , summon spectator , tenfold ironguard , and warning .</p>
<h3>Relics</h3>
<h2>Dogma</h2>
<h3>Beliefs</h3>
<p>Helm's faithful carried out their orders with precision and adhered to an distinct and unbending hierarchy. Only members of the church's upper ranks took it upon themselves to interpret the church's rigid laws and strict dogma.</p>
<p>According to Helm's law, anyone found guilty of attempted murder would suffer the loss of their hand.</p>
<p>The practice of controlling the undead , as opposed to their outright destruction, was abhorrent to the faithful of Helm.</p>
<p>Helm forbade the owning of slaves among his followers. This command was ignored by the Golden Legion during their campaign in Maztica.</p>
<h3>Attitudes</h3>
<p>Novices or initiates of the church were trained to be vigilant and dutiful in carrying out their orders. In their service, they learned to never betray the trust that was bestowed upon them, which extended to the manner in which they considered martial combat. They had to rely upon themselves, their weapons , and their allies in order to best plan and coordinate defense and attacks in battle. They trained often, crafted weapons and other armaments, and set up caches that any member of the church could access in times of need.</p>
<p>While Helmite clergy were taught to be steadfast in their duty as guardians, they were taught not to parlay any title or rank to exert undue authority over others. They were to remain just as watchful for corruption as they were vigilant in defense of their charge. They followed the Law of Service , that forbade the acceptance of bribes.</p>
<p>Devotees of Helm tended not to regard kindness or niceties in high regard, focusing more on duty and perseverance. As a result they were often seen as rigid and uncaring individuals.</p>
<h2>Orders</h2>
<h3>Priestly Orders</h3>
<p>The various orders of priests , or "pryats", within the church:</p>
<h3>Military Orders</h3>
<p>Many abbeys of helm maintained strong armies and sponsored various military groups, in order to defend their congregation. These included:</p>
<h3>Other Orders</h3>
<h2>Classes</h2>
<p>Specialty priests of Helm were known as Watchers , or Godseyes. They were stalwart battle-priests that wore full plate mail, were granted exceptional combat training, and wielded potent defensive and offensive magic.</p>
<p>The Bulwarks were those priests that worked tirelessly to restore Helm's Good name when the church suffered a crisis of followers during the mid–14 th century DR. Questers were champions of Helm that set out to recover long-lost artifacts or rescue individuals that had been taken captive against their will.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Despite sharing similar doctrines, priests from the churches of Helm and Torm shared an unfriendly and rivalrous relationship with one another.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Formation of the Council</h3>
<p>For many years the Helmite faith was one of the most highly respected across the Realms, especially in the North .</p>
<p>In the mid-13 th century, great Helmite cleric, Garshond , led the defense of Iriaebor from a goblinoid army. Following the battle, the battle-priest was presented with the Helm of Helm , which rose out of a nearby bog and seemingly chose him as its new wearer. Donning the ancient relic, Garshond returned to the Watchtower of the Vigilant , a lone keep found in nearby scrublands, which surrounded the long-ruined town of Harkstag .</p>
<p>From the sentry-like outpost, Garshond reached out to the rich, noble families of Waterdeep , Iriaebor and Scornubel , and invited them to his stronghold for a meeting of minds regarding the protection of the northern heartlands and the Sword Coast North . This assembly came to be known as the first Council of Helm , which saw the formation of the Vigilant Riders . These elite guardians would protect the region for several years, and helped ensure welfare for the small villages and hamlets as far south as Baldur's Gate .</p>
<p>Helmite knights played an important role in maintaining order in Tethyr during the years of the Tethyrian Interregnum .</p>
<h3>Time of Troubles</h3>
<p>During the Time of Troubles in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Helm was the one deity allowed by Ao to retain his divine powers. He was tasked with preventing the avatars of other gods from ascending the Celestial Stairway to access other planes of the multiverse . At one point during the crisis, the God of Guardians was even forced to slay the avatar of the goddess Mystra.</p>
<p>After the Time of Troubles, the reputation of Helm and his clergy were heavily tarnished across most of Faerûn. The ranks of their faithful diminished greatly and in some regions such as the North, they were openly persecuted. The Helmite faith of Faerûn's southern realms were unaffected in this manner, and in fact his faithful in the Vilhon Reach believed he had protected them during the crisis. Some theologians theorized that this great concentration of followers allowed Helm to retain his stature as an intermediate power despite the start loss of worshipers across the breadth of Faerûn.</p>
<p>In response the church crafted stories that declared these "falsehoods" about Helm's faith were the work of various evil faiths, spread by the churches of Bane , Cyric , and Shar , meant to destabilize the Realms. Clergy members were offered promotions within the church for every high-ranking priest or priestess of those faiths they slew. Many of them became overly-zealous and even fanatical in their persecution of these admittingly self-serving faiths.</p>
<h3>Involvement in Maztica</h3>
<p>Word of the "discovery" of a new land far to the west of the Moonshae Isles was spread far and wide by Helm's devoted followers in the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR . The colony of New Amn was founded the following year, in the Year of the Helm, 1362 DR . Inexplicably immune to the distrust and weariness in four years following the Avatar Crisis, the Amnian church of Helm said the occasion would mark a new blessed age for their faith.</p>
<p>A few years later, in the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR , the Waterdhavian branch of the church, along with the Adarbrent , Helmfast , Jardeth and Raventree noble families sponsored a transoceanic expedition of twelve ships across the Trackless Sea to the land of Maztica. While they were turned away at Helmsport by the Lord-Governor of New Amn , the colonists settled on Maztapan Island , and opened lines of trade and negotiation with the native Kultakan people. Within months they formed the colony of New Waterdeep , and after forging further north, the second settlement of Trythosford .</p>
<p>At some point, the Helmite knights known as Companions of the One True Vision slaughtered many native Maztican people. This order was scorned across Faerûn, and many of their guilt-ridden brothers atoned for their sins by serving among the altruistic order, the Vigilant Eyes of the God . Many others simply became much more cautious when carrying out Helm's will in the Realms.</p>
<h3>Helm's Death and Rebirth</h3>
<p>Some twenty years later, a tragic misunderstanding that broke out between the gods of the Upper planes led to devastation of Helm's church in the Realms. As the gods Tyr and Tymora were proposed to be united, they began a courtship that was overseen under Helm's watchful eye. Under some unknown circumstances, Tyr came to believe that Helm had wooed Tymora while offering her his own sentiments. In the Year of Three Streams Blooded, 1384 DR , Tyr was forced in accordance of his own ethos to slay his longtime friend Helm, and strike the God of Guardians from the Faerûnian pantheon .</p>
<p>In the century following his death, Helm's followers stopped receiving signs from their god. Many of them forsook their vows and local shrines in major cities were left abandoned. However, faith in Helm did not disappear from the Realms completely.</p>
<p>The Cathedral of Helm , which had yet to be completely built when its patron deity was killed, remained open throughout the late 14 th and 15 th centuries DR. It became a bastion of hope for those unfortunate souls that were afflicted by the horrors of the Spellplague . A new prophet of Helm by the name of Rohini emerged to lead the Cathedral in the late 1470s, prophesizing her god's inevitable return to the Realms. However, Rohini was actually a fiend from the Nine Hells , dispatched by garner information about the Realms for her devilish superiors. Eventually Rohini was revealed as the fiend and fraud she was, and Javen Tarmikos . While in the chapel, the devout Javen received a sign of Helm's return: his holy symbol of Helm's Unblinking Eye wept tears of gold. Some faithful flocked to Helm's Hold to witness the miracle, while others remained skeptical about the entire phenomenon.</p>
<p>Helm finally reappeared in the Realms during the world-altering events of the Second Sundering . In the Year of the Nether Mountain Scrolls, 1486 DR , the God of Guardians manifested before one of his most devout and loyal followers, his chosen Kleef Kenric , as he ventured across the Underchasm to Sadrach's Spire . Within a few years his power was restored to the Faerûnian pantheon.</p>
