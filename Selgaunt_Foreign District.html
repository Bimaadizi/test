<p>The Foreign District was a ward of Selgaunt dedicated to commerce and travelers, visitors, and foreigners in general.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This district was located close to the center of Selgaunt, north of Temple Avenue .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like other sections of Selgaunt, the Foreign District was home to wood and stone or brick buildings that often had some kind of architectural flourish or another, as buildings in the city were typically designed to dazzle spectators. The building types of the district were predominated by boarding houses, inns, eateries, taverns, and equipment shops. Many shop fronts had painted signs hung outside, designed to attract the attention of newcomers. Some sported roadside animal pens.</p>
<p>Its borders with the other districts were denoted by an ancient stone wall of granite . By the 1370s DR this wall had deteriorated away to a mere thigh-height, making its separation more symbolic than literal, reflective of the Selgauntan contempt for foreigners.</p>
<p>Both its cobblestoned main thoroughfares and alleyways were wide, with the former able to accommodate the larger oxen drawn wagons that ferried goods to the wharves, farmers' wagons, and horse -drawn carts. Closer to Temple Avenue, the district's roads got narrower and its inns fewer. In some areas, the close by Hunting Gardens of the Hulorn dominated the skyline. Trees and streetlights dotted along the roads, illuminating the area at night.</p>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR, Hulorn Andeth Ilchammar expressed his strange artistic tastes by having monstrous statuary placed in parts of the Foreign District. Examples of this included a bronze statue of a chimera on a raised pedestal and a stone fountain with a hydra centerpiece, whose waters were dyed and rigged to spurt out from the hydra's heads.</p>
<h2>Law</h2>
<p>The district was thoroughly patrolled by the Scepters of Selgaunt, so much so that the Zhentarim considered it to be a "hot zone".</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Foreign District received foot traffic from all walks of life, including adventurers beggars, pickpockets and other rogues , laborers, merchants and traders, mercenaries , coinlasses , and even the occasional noble coach. Its permanent residents were most predominantly street vendors.</p>
