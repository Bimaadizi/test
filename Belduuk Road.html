<p>Belduuk Road was a roadway found in Sembia that connected Saerloon in the south with Saerb in the north.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Originating in Saerloon on the Sea of Fallen Stars , the Belduuk Road stretched northwest, intersecting Mulhessen and the Way of the Manticore . The road proceeded north through bogs, passing through Olturret , before terminating at the town of Saerb. This northern stretch was colloquially known as "the Rattlebones Ride " because it was horribly bumpy as a result of countless logs buried in the ground to allow for travelers to cross the bogs.</p>
