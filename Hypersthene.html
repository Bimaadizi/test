<p>Hypersthene , also known as bronzite , was a gemstone usually cut cabochon .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This semi-precious stone was brown and opaque (sometimes reddish or greenish) and contained silvery spangles. It was rare to find an unflawed piece larger than 1 ⁄ 2 in (13 mm) across, and as a result the stone yielded small gemstones. A typical stone had a base value of 50 gp.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Carrying or wearing one of these gemstones made the bearer undetectable by the wyvern watch spell. In common parlance this property was known as wyvern warding.</p>
