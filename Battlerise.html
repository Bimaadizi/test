<p>Battlerise was a hamlet in southeastern Cormyr on the Way of the Manticore , situated west of the Darkflow River and south of the Vast Swamp close to Sembia .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Besides a small population of turnip farmers, the Margar family owned a waystable that was fortified with its own palisade. There the family traded fresh horses to travelers in exchange for their road-weary ones, or sold them outright.</p>
<p>Various nobles attempted throughout the years to rebuild the castle on the hill in order to use it as a base for trade with neighboring Sembia . However, their efforts were defeated by the presence of the Cult of the Dragon , who had already been using the vaults below the castle as a headquarters for their own sorcerous, clandestine operations. Unbeknownst to the Margars, the Cult also had an agent installed as one of the hired hands working for the family.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Battlerise was named for the nearby hill topped with the ruins of Battlegate Castle , once the seat of the extinct Auantiver noble family. The hamlet itself was once a larger village, but its population was greatly reduced after it was attacked by monsters raiding out of the Vast Swamp such as lizardfolk .</p>
