<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Adventuring (to 1341 DR)</h3>
<p>Gorstag had adventured together with Dammasae. Of the at least two dracoliches Dammasae had destroyed, one or more had been destroyed with Gorstag's aid. He described adventuring pains as forgettable.</p>
<p>After Dammasae gave birth to her daughter Shandril in Elturel, she remained there for eight months before departing for Shadowdale. Gorstag accompanied the family in the trip, but the group was ambushed at the Bridge of Fallen Men . Garthond died; Dammasae and Gorstag were both heavily injured, and though he sought healing at High Horn , it was too late to save Dammasae. He and the infant Shandril were ultimately the only survivors. The responsibility of hiding her fell squarely on him. Gorstag took the baby to Deepingdale , hoping to leave her with the elves and make for the Tower Tranquil , where he'd loot Garthond's belongings for Shandril to have; the elves warned him the Tower was now a Cult redoubt, annexed into the lair of Rauglothgor . Instead, he bought an old inn, once belonging to his father, counting on his relative obscurity to hide him from the Cult.</p>
<h3>Innkeeping (from 1341 DR)</h3>
<p>While in the position of innkeeper and Shandril's tutor, Gorstag had once taken on Shandril on the bet she could not consume a great blandreth of soup by herself. She had also seen him to host sisters of the Soil, priestesses of Chauntea . He taught Shandril of innkeeping trade.</p>
<p>In Mirtul 6 of the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Gorstag broke a fight when the visiting Company of the Bright Spear lost its thief, Lynxal , slain while pickpocketing a local man, Ghondarrath . The next morning, Shandril ran off with the Company of the Bright Blade, leaving a note behind. Per Elminster , Gorstag was quite pained by that. During that time, one of his maids, Lureene , became close to him, hoping to ease his pain. About two months after Shandril's parting, he proposed to Lureene, and she accepted; that same evening, in Flamerule 8 , Shandril returned to the inn, to his joy and relief. Gorstag spoke at length with Narm during that evening, learning of Shandril's foes, and explained at length what he knew of her parents. He offered Shandril an amulet protecting against detection and location, which she accepted. He later gifted Narm a Luck medallion of Tymora .</p>
<p>However, his cook, Korvan, was a member of the Cult of the Dragon , and informed on Shandril's arrival; Gorstag had to slay the man, just as the newlyweds had left the inn. He was prevented from chasing after them by the arrival of Delg Ironstar , a dwarf bearing a letter from Elminster, who was sent to chase after them instead. He later fought off and slew Sintre , a Malaugrym impersonating a priestess of Oghma . The events took place over the next day, Flamerule 9 .</p>
<p>Unknown to him, Shandril later briefly scried on him while he was together with Lureene, to no greater consequence, at some point before her next contact: He received another contact from her later that month, close to or on Flamerule 22 , after Shandril destroyed the Wizards' Tower in the Citadel of the Raven , learning that Shandril was with child. After Shandril's immolation and death on Flamerule 27 , Mystra brought the spellfire-hurling lass to Gorstag briefly.</p>
<p>Decades later, Gorstag was considering expanding the inn. By that point he studiously avoided saying anything about Shandril; recently, a secret shaft was discovered beneath his establishment.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Gorstag told that the amulet of proof against detection and location he kept was pilfered from an evil necromancer, whose brother was beat to death by an 8-year old armed who drew him out of his tower by throwing rocks at the window. He didn't elaborate.</p>
<p>Some rumors flew that Gorstag may have been Shandril's father.</p>
<p>Per Volothamp Geddarm , Gorstag said he had met the Deeping Princess, but he wasn't anywhere near old enough for that. Also according to Volo, someone had rented the hidden space recently discovered beneath the inn, but Gorstag would not say who.</p>
