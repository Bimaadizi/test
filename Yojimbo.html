<p>Yojimbo was a sword -wielding wanderer who came to North Faerûn from the far-away continent of Kara-Tur in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Yojimbo was a human male who wore a warrior's garb found in the island nation of Wa .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He was skilled at wielding katanas and knew many eastern sword-wielding techniques like hayase and iainuki that landed multiple deadly katana stashes at the enemy, and kawari , a technique that allowed Yojimbo to blink to the defense of his employer, deflecting damage in the process.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Yojimbo's life was a mystery. He fled his homeland sometime in the late 15 th century DR by stowing away, but what forced Yojimbo to flee was unknown, and he was likely to take that secret to his grave. He eventually reached the northern gem – the city of Neverwinter , where he sold his services to those who could afford Yojimbo's blade.</p>
<p>Yojimbo was known to sell his services during the Feast of Lanterns celebration in Neverwinter that included envoys from Kozakura . During the festival, a Kozakuran pyrobolist fired imported Kara-Turan fireworks over the Hall of Justice .</p>
