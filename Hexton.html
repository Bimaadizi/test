<p>Hextons were the fifth rank of hierarch modrons .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hextons were shaped like humanoids with long arms and six-fingered hands, as well as four tentacles that ended in sharp claws. They also possessed fan-like wings.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>If forced into combat, a hexton used a combination of innate abilities, spells, fists and their sharp claws.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like all hierarch modrons, hextons had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of clairaudience , clairvoyance , command , dimension door , teleport without error , and wall of force spells at will. Hextons were able to cast arcane spells as well as divine spells from the Law , Protection and War domains. Hextons were immune to all effects that influenced the mind, including all psionic -based attacks, and had a resistance to acid , cold and fire .</p>
<p>Hextons could also communicate telepathically with any sentient creature within 216 miles (348 kilometers) and could see in areas of total darkness from up to 60 feet (18 meters).</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>There were only 36 hextons in modron society. They could communicate with other hextons and with quintons , and relayed their orders to septons . Hextons were the generals of the 36 modron armies. Two of these armies served each of the secundi , three served the tertians , sixteen were associated with each of the sixteen regions of Mechanus , and the rest were at the direct disposal of Primus . Hextons could communicate telepathically with anyone in a 216-mile (348 km) radius.</p>
<p>Hextons were always created as the result of septons being upgraded to take the place of a destroyed hexton, or in case a vacancy appeared due to a hexton being promoted to the rank of quinton.</p>
<h2>Notable Hextons</h2>
<p>An unidentified rogue hexton owned a shop in Sigil where it constructed steel predators for hire as assassins.</p>
