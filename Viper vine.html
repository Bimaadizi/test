<p>Viper vines were intelligent plants that grew in the jungles of Chult .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These thick vines were hungry and malicious. They hung from trees and were very difficult to distinguish from normal, harmless vines. They were 20​ to ​50 feet (6.1​ to ​15 meters) in length.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Viper vines launched surprise attacks on passing creatures, including humanoids , in order to feed on them. They would wrap around and begin to constrict their victims, and in the process released a paralytic poison to prevent their prey from breaking free. Once the victim was dead, the vines would begin to "eat" them.</p>
