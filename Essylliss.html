<p>Essylliss was a demigod of the lizardfolk with dominion over their race, but he was nearly forgotten by them. Essylliss was considered an aspect of the World Serpent .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the creation of the lizardfolk race by the sarrukh , the World Serpent worried they would be distracted by the call of the many other gods and that they needed a deity of their own. Thus he created a fragment of himself in the semblance of a lizardman, Essylliss.</p>
<p>Worship of Essylliss survived the decline of sarrukh rule in Mhairshaulk for some two millennia, until around −31,500 DR . However, the divided factions of lizardfolk eventually began to worship Semuanya , another fragment of the World Serpent representing the instinct to survive.</p>
<p>By the 14th century DR , almost no trace of Essylliss survived and only a small number of lizardfolk continued to worship him. Among them was Kessessek , a low-placed lizardfolk of the Sharptooth tribe in the Vast Swamp and cleric of this nearly forgotten god. However, in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Kessessek proved himself by turning away undead Shadowscales and the leaderless Sharptooths elected him as their new chieftain.</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Essylliss's favored weapon was the club . Clerics of Essylliss who cast weapon of the deity received a +1 impact club.</p>
