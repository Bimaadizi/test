<p>Nar-sek Qu'tel was a neutral meeting ground for the tribes of Narfell and a refuge for the tribes in times of exceptionally bad storms on the open grassland.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The site lay on the western slopes of Hark's Finger , the great solitary mountain located between Lake Mereth and the Icelace Lake , in central Narfell, some 100 miles (160 kilometers) north from the Long Road (Northeast Faerûn) , and the waymeet Ormpur .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nar-sek Qu'tel was a small circular canyon a few hundred square yards in area, encapsulated on three sides by high cliff walls. A wide entrance prevented this place from being a choice defensive point as enemies had easy access into the canyon. Even so, this was a place where the different clans of Narfell could meet and trade freely under the principles of neutrality that would deny no tribe, no matter the grievances they had out in the plains, or how crowded the canyon became.</p>
