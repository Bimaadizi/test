<p>Belib's everlasting torch was a unique mace that was initially designed to be an inextinguishable lantern .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Belib's everlasting torch was a lantern, tastefully designed and lit with bright orange flames.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Belib's magic weapon possessed only one enchantment , the mace's head was constantly lit aflame and could not be extinguished by any means. It kept burning in water, buried underground, and when swung at beasts. When used in battle, it burned the target of the weapon's blows and had a great chance of lighting them on fire, dealing even more devastating fire damage.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The everlasting torch once belonged to Belib the Wary of Waterdeep , sometime before the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR . Belib was a gnome who believed himself to be the most well-equipped adventurer in the Realms, despite the fact that he'd never left his home to participate in the said adventures. Belib's everlasting torch was one among many powerful items enchanted to be used by adventurers in their dangerous trade. He spent years creating his equipment, and one day, he finished his last item, packed them in a sizable rucksack, and stepped out of his home, ready for a grand escapade. His adventure ended before it began as the gnome tripped over his stoop and was crushed by his own equipment. The bag split open, scattering all of his precious gear, immediately claimed by the endless Waterdhavian passersby.</p>
<p>Eventually, Belib's body was raised by a priestess , but he returned to his home, just like his rucksack – completely looted. Disheartened, the gnome created a handful of magic items for the priestess, who returned him to life and left Waterdeep for his homeland. As of the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , Belib's everlasting torch was in the hands of a conniving drow merchant, Nym , who traveled the North and sold his magical curios. The drow was still in possession of the mace during his visit to the Wandering Village , east of the town of Kuldahar in 1312 DR .</p>
