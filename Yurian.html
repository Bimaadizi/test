<p>The yurians , also known as crabmen , were a race of crustacean beings that inhabited the seas and rivers of Faerûn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Second Serôs War in −8298 DR , the sea elf empire, Aryselmalyr , used crabmen, merfolk , and locathah forces to destroy the Kuo-Toan Consortiums . The war ended in −8282 DR with a massacre of the kuo-toa in the Sea of Fallen Stars .</p>
<p>In 1369 DR a community of crabmen inhabited caverns just south from Port Llast , and began raiding first the fishing boats, then the town itself. The First Captain Haeromos Dothwintyl was slain defending the town, so Hylas of Elturel , an arrogant knight of Torm’s fury, serving the Lords' Alliance arrived to help the command the militia alongside the veteran Kendrack. An exploratory advance upon the crabmen's caverns sent the force fleeing, and an excursion to sea likewise ends in failure and death as the crabmen leads a massive jellyfish to attack the cog. After yet another raid on Port Llast they learn, with help from a local sage, that the crabmen have been enslaved by magic. While most of the militia distracted the crabmen, Kendrack and Hylas lead a small team into the crabmen's caves, here they found a sahuagin sorcerer controlling the crabmen and jellyfish both. Slaing the sahuagin freed the crabmen community who in turned let the group depart back to Port Llast.</p>
