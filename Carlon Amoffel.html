<p>Carlon Amoffel was an agent of the Harpers that operated throughout the Sword Coast , and was tasked with investigating the Cult of the Dragon in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He had a tattoo of the Harpers' insignia inscribed upon his arm.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time in the 1480s DR , Carlon began investigating a group of dragon cult smugglers that were transporting stolen goods north along the Trade Way towards Waterdeep . When the cultists began to suspect his affiliation, Carlon attempted to share what he learned with another agent at the inn. Unfortunately the Dragon Cult labeled him a supported of local bandits, and local townspeople buried him up to his neck along the road, and painted the epithet "Oathbreaker" upon his forehead.</p>
<p>While Carlon remained immobile in the dirt, he concocted a tale that he was betrothed to a woman whose family members were avowed bandits. He then valiantly ended their engagement when it became clear he was expected to join her family's trade.</p>
