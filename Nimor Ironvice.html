<p>Nimor Ironvice was a member of a group of duergar followers of Asmodeus under Fire-Speaker Kholzourl who mined hellthorn in the depths of Gauntlgrym around 1480 DR .</p>
<p>He scouted the surface and there Nimor met and befriend Mordai Vell , leader of the Ashmadai . Vell also wanted hellthorn, so Nimor started smuggling the mineral to the ashmadai for a very high price. He was very careful, knowing that Kholzourl would kill him if caught, but he hoped that Asmodeus would send a sign of approbation for his actions.</p>
