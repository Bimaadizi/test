<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1372 DR, Gaussra was a novice priestess at Arach-Tinilith. She joined Drisinil Drisinil Barrison Del'Armgo 's group of conspirators to overthrow Mistress Quenthel Baenre , seeking power and believing that demons attempting to assassinate her were signs of Lolth 's disfavor with Quenthel. Quenthel discovered the plot and pretended to poison Drisinil in order to have her bring her fellow conspirators to an unused classroom in Arach-Tinilith, where she summoned hordes of spiders that slew them, including Gaussra.</p>
