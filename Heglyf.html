<p>Heglyf was the leader of the infamous adventuring troupe of occultist hunters called the Band of the Key , active many years before the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Heglyf was a skinny, mustached man whose weapons of choice were crossbows , as they could remain armed and cocked for long periods of time, unlike bows .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Long before the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , Heglyf led the Band of the Key in an endless quest to find and retrieve evil magical texts from the hands of villains. Heglyf was mostly remembered for commissioning a new type of enchanted bolt —the tranquil bolt —from a group of Deneirian priests . The bolts were especially useful against spellcasters as they rendered mages and other spellslingers silent .</p>
