<h2>History</h2>

<p>In 1357 DR, Mogion, for the first time, received a call from her god summoning her to Yûlash. Soon Mogion settled in the ruined city and despite her god's avatar having been destroyed by Alias 's party, Mogion grew in power and clerical abilities until she was named the next Mouth of Moander.</p>
<p>Soon she contacted Radatha of the Fire Knives in order to start the New Alliance .</p>
<p>When the adventuring party possessing the Azure Bonds arrived in Yûlash, Mogion started preparations for a ritual to awaken Moander.
