<p>Sheikh Sabkhat was the head of the Mtair Dhafir tribe of Bedine circa the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The older sheikh was bone thin with eyes that were clouded over and only a wisp of a beard remaining on his chin.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Sabkhat had a strained relationship with his daughter Ruha , who proved to have premonitions of the future at a young age. Because the Bedine people completely eschewed the use of magic , the sheikh sent Ruha to live with an exiled sorceress called Qoha'dar at the Sister of Rains oasis. After Qoha'dar died, Ruha spent a year searching for the Mtairi camp and eventually returned to her tribe. Families threatened to leave the Mtairi due to her return, and Sheikh Sabkhat was made the decision to marry her away to the son of a fellow tribe leader.</p>
<p>He had a formidable ally in Al'Aif , the most fearsome warrior of the entire tribe.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ruha returned to the Mtair Dhafir and was sent away again by Sheikh Sabkhat in the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR . That same year Sheikh Sabkhat was approached by the charismatic warrior Zarud , who served as the spokesperson for the Zhentarim to the Bedine people. He was put under magical influence by the mage Yhekal and compelled to form an alliance with the Zhent outlanders. While Ruha and Al'Aif were able to talk some sense into Sheikh Sabkhat, he ultimately agreed to Zarud's conditions without entering into a formal alliance.</p>
<p>The death of Zarud the following night prevented the agreement between the Mtairi and Zhentarim from moving forward. According to Sheikh Sabkhat the tribe's only option was to "pay the blood price" and offer Zarud's killer over to the Zhentarim and hope they accept. Unfortunately for the sheikh, all the signs pointed to his daughter Ruha as being the murderer. While Al'Aif was able to let Ruha and her allies free, the rest of the Mtair Dhafir were not so fortunate. The tribespeople were slain by the Zhentilar army and their bodies fed to the Zhent's asabi mercenaries.</p>
