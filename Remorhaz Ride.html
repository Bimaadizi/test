<p>The Remorhaz Ride was an icy path that crossed the tundra west of the Great Glacier , connecting Frozen Flindyke with Mount Ghaethlauntar . The course of the road passed through the eastern edge of the Frozen Forest .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The bridge in Flindyke linked the Remorhaz Ride with the Way of the Powrie trail, which continued southwards into the lands of the Moonsea .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The territory surrounding the road had long been claimed by gnolls , but as of the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR , marauding remorhaz freely roamed the region, after they had been chased down from the Great Glacier by more dire threats. Despite the danger, gnolls continued to use the road to move sledge caravans full of ore from Mount Ghaethluntar to Frozen Flindyke.</p>
