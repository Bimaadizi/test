<p>Bows were two-handed, muscle-powered projectile weapons used to shoot arrows at distant targets.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bows came in a variety of different sizes and could be made of wood, horn, or bone. Composite bows were made of thin layers of these materials laminated together for extra strength. The earliest bows in recorded history typically had strings made of either animal tendons or plant fiber.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>Though bows varied in the ranges they could reach, the strength of an archer could increase that potential range and damage. However, a bow needed be built to withstand higher forces. Composite bows were necessary to take full advantage of great strength.</p>
<p>One of the biggest problems facing any archer was deciding what to do when a foe got within melee reach.</p>
<h2>Types of Bows</h2>
<p>In the Realms bows generally fell into one of two classifications: shortbows and longbows .</p>
<p>Shortbows were the first type of bow to developed, although they were not referred to by that term until much later after the invention of the longbow. And as their name implied, they were smaller than longbows, with correspondingly less range and penetration. Over time longbows were developed as people gave bows longer staves in an effort to increase their range. though other found ways of increasing the flexibility of bows without increasing the length of their staves.</p>
<p>A third classification of bow was the composite. This could be either a long or shortbow, with the distinction being that a composite had a stave made of more than one material. This gave the bow greater flexibility and consequently greater range.</p>
<h3>Varieties</h3>
<h2>Price</h2>
<p>The price of a bow was often greater than the price of a sword . In addition, one had to consider the added cost of the weapon's needed arrows. Being built to withstand higher forces typically increased the cost of a bow dramatically.</p>
