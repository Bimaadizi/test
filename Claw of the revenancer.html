<p>The claw of the revenancer was an enchanted silver gauntlet that had the distinction of being an artifact of the drow goddess Kiaransalee . It was famously wielded by the high priestess, Irae T'sarran during the Silence of Lolth .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The claw of the revenancer was a finely wrought silver gauntlet that wrapped around the hand and forearm of the wearer. It had an delicate bracelet that, by way of an intricate lattice, connected to a set of five silver rings that, in turn, attached over the wearer's fingers. Although it appeared as a purely decorative magical item, the claw was shaped to also be used as melee weapon and, true to its name, could inflict wounds consistent with a viciously clawed hand.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Uniquely, the claw of the revenancer had the combined powers of a magic ring , glove, and bracelet all in one item. The claw granted the wearer a great degree of protection; it had the powers of both a set of bracers of armor +5 and an amulet of natural armor +5 .</p>
<p>Additionally, it functioned as a +1 gauntlet in power when used during combat as a "claw". The claw of the revenancer conferred not only proficiency in battle but also infused the wielder's attacks with negative energy . These offensive abilities, combined with the aforementioned defensive properties, made it very effective in combat.</p>
<p>Most well-known among its abilities, the claw allowed its wielder to change a corpse into an undead creature. This could only be achieved by a wielder with access to create greater undead . They used the gauntlet to touch a corpse, and this corpse would then transform it into either a revenant or a silveraith . The claw had a great affinity with its revenant creations, able to transform up to three corpses a day into revenants. Furthermore, these revenants were not independent hunters of their killer but rather were under the control of the wielder of the claw . Finally, once a tenday, the claw could create a silveraith from the touched corpse of a magic-user . However, neither the creation of a silveraith nor a revenant could be performed on the same day.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the course of the Silence of Lolth in 1372 DR , the claw of the revenancer was wielded by the high priestess of Kiaransalee in Maerimydra , Irae T'sarran . She used the claw to transform many inhabitants of Castle Maerimydra into revenants after she slaughtered House Ch√ªmavh on Eleint 28 . A few days later, on Marpenoth 2 , Irae again used the power of the claw to transform the archmage of Maerimydra, Duneth Wharreil , into a silveraith.</p>
