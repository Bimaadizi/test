<p>Gruel was the leader of a Zhentilar press gang in the village of Snowmantle during the mid-14 th century DR . The half-orc and his crew were regulars of the Singing Dryad "tavern", which was in-fact a mess hall for the occupying Zhent soldiers.</p>
<p>He was an outright stupid thug, who was easily incited to violence despite orders to refrain from the overseeing Zhentarim wizard Ragnoth .</p>
