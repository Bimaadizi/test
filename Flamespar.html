<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the salt Mines of Selgol were attacked by a tribe of firenewts led by the massive lizard Overlord Flamespar. The creatures and their pet hell hounds rose from the deeper underground and poured into the mining tunnels. The creatures dragged workers away and took the mines as the surviving workers fled. Torich 's militia was informed of the attack but failed to act in a timely manner. Essien , one of the mine's foremen, was desperate for help against the fiery monsters. Some said that a group of adventurers who worked with merchant Sa'Sani of Samargol volunteered to help with the situation and eradicate the infestation after meeting the man drinking his sorrows away at The Broken Pick in Torich .</p>
