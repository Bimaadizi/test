<p>The Shining Sea was one of the great seas of Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The sea stretched from the coastline of Chult in the south, to the shoreline of Calimshan in the north. The Shining Sea had a large amount of trade and traffic. It was quite large, although it was not as large as the Trackless Sea or the Sea of Swords . The island nation of Tharsult was located in the sea's eastern reaches.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>A rare beautiful species of intelligent firebirds dwelt across the Shining Sea, in seclusion, away from prying eyes. These birds were legendary among Chultans for their perfect beauty, but they were also infamous for their horrible shrieks the birds themselves called "singing."</p>
