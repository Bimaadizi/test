<p>Daelyth's Dagger was a deep dell in the Lost Peaks with old fortifications. Its lower entrance was a narrow path alongside a stream that was only wide enough for one humanoid to walk along, with steep rock sides. Its upper entrance was a steep trail leading higher up into the mountains. There was also a secret cavern leading to neighboring valleys.</p>
