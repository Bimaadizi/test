<p>Klorrvank was a fisherman from the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Klorrvank was a dragonborn man with brown hide and scaling. He wore a simple tan-colored tunic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , as the Absolute crisis ravaged the Gate, Klorrvank's fishing business was damaged further by pollution of the Gray Harbor . Fishers in the Lower City kept pulling up nets filled with fish covered in black oily goo. Klorrvank worked diligently, waiting for the next fishing boat once it was clear that most of the catch was spoiled and inedible. In reality, the fish were smothered in oil pollution left behind by a submersible used by the Cult of Bane to transport Lord Gortash 's prisoners into the drowned Iron Throne headquarters prison at the bottom of Gray Harbor.</p>
