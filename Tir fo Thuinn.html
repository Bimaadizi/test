<p>Manannan Mac Lir was an interloper deity of oceans who originated from another plane of existence . There were no known worshipers of mac Lir on Toril .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The avatar form of mac Lir was that of a large human male with a red beard.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He held great respect for those who could master the seas, but showed no pity for those who drowned.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>When in a body of salt water, mac Lir was immune to the effects of nearly any magical item . The ocean god was also capable of calling upon any ocean creature to fight for him.</p>
<p>Within his divine realm he could either grant or deprive creatures of the ability to breathe water. He also had absolute control of any magical item or spell that granted the ability to breathe water, being capable of deactivating them at his whim. He was willing to grant water breathing to anyone who asked him nicely, though would take it away if he felt the ability was being abused.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>This deity owned a set of armor made of metal and sea shells, with a +5 enchantment , which he typically donned when entering combat. In terms of weapons he owned a magical trident , which could extract the moisture from a foe's body, and a deadly broadsword known as Retaliator . A blade that would almost certainly kill any fire giants it struck instantly. He also owned a sea chariot that his avatar rode upon, pulled by various sea creatures.</p>
<h2>Realm</h2>
<p>Manannan Mac Lir lived within the Outlands , in the divine realm of Tir fo Thuinn . This domain was a large lake located near the Celtic pantheon 's main realm of Tir na Og , at the base of the Spire . The realm was full of stunning undersea vistas. Strewn with shells, aquamarine , and turquoise .</p>
<p>His petitioners lived their lives as if they were still above land, albeit with both obvious and subtle differences, such as herding fish in place of cattle and sheep . His petitioners were also callous to travelers that fell on hard times.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Manannan Mac Lir generally considered fire giants to be his enemies and would reserve the use of his blade Retaliator for fighting them.</p>
<p>After being rivals for eons, mac Lir and Poseidon agreed to put their differences aside and began to improve their relations, though they were far from being close.</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>The priests of his faith could be either clerics or druids . They typically wielded maces or tridents as weapons. They wore a helmet and kilt for priestly vestments. They had access to spells from the animal , astral , combat , divination , elemental , guardian , healing , plant , summoning , and weather spheres . They particularly had access to the spells create or destroy water and water breathing .</p>
<p>His priests were required to base themselves in coastal regions or villages, but were permitted to travel inland on any business that could affect the seas. They were also encouraged to protect both the ocean and its creatures.</p>
<p>Some of the marids of Zakhara paid homage to mac Lir, having a shrine to him at their Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls .</p>
