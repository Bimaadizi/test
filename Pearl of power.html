<p>Pearls of power were magically empowered pearls that allowed a spellcaster to recast spells that he or she had already cast.</p>
<h2>Desciption</h2>
<p>Without the means of magic detection , a pearl of power appeared no different than a typical pearl of average size and quality. To those able to detect magic, however, such a pearl gave off a strong aura of transmutation magic.</p>
<p>In magic shops, pearls of power sold anywhere from 1,000 gold pieces for the weakest varieties to as much as 81,000 gold pieces for the most powerful pearls.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Simply by uttering a magical command word, a holder of a pearl of power could recall any spell already cast that day. The spellcaster could then cast that spell again without having to proceed through the usual methods of preparation. It did not matter whether the spell had been prepared by arcane or divine means. A pearl of power was of no use to a spellcaster who did not access the Weave through spell-preparation, such as a sorcerer .</p>
<p>Most pearls permitted the recall of only one cast spell per day, but at least one variety allowed the recall of two per day. Each pearl was limited to the recall of spells of the same general power as each other, with the exception of the variety of pearl that could be used twice a day.</p>
