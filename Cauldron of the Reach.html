<p>The Cauldron of the Reach was the cartographic name given to the waters between the isle of Thelve and the trio of islands known as the Crab Reach , west of the library fortress of Candlekeep .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Cauldron was a briny body of water on the western end of Thelve's hazardous northern shores into which the freshwater swamp of Taglan's Bones drained into. The "Cauldron of the Reach" name was used exclusively by sages and scribes of Candlekeep as well as some bards , never by local sailors.</p>
