<p>Huge ravens were a type of raven larger and smarter than their common kin, but smaller and dumber than the giant ravens who were used as mounts by certain Uthgardt tribes .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Huge ravens were twice the size of normal ravens, standing at 4 feet (1.2 meters) with a wingspan of 6 feet (1.8 meters). Otherwise, they looked just like their smaller cousins.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>While smarter than normal birds, they were only just smart enough to have a slightly malicious disposition. They were often used by evil masters, and the attitude of their masters had a far larger impact on the huge raven's general attitude than their own natural disposition would otherwise suggest.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Huge ravens would attack as flocks, with each member diving down and trying to pluck out the eyes of their targets. About one-in-ten successful attacks from these birds would result in a lost eye to their enemies, which was the only true danger these birds possessed.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Huge ravens lived in flocks, and any solitary specimen encountered would be a scout ranging out and guarding against potential enemies or looking for opportunities to feed. Should they spot any danger, they would fly away and report to their flocks by warning cries and aerial movements.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>They were known to roost throughout the great Cormanthor forest.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime between 1367 DR and 1372 DR , close to the small village of Wargrave in Impiltur , a flock of huge ravens nested amongst the nearby necropolis. Those who ventured out into the necropolis, during the night, risked being attacked by the malicious birds.</p>
