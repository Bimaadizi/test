<p>The Mare's Tail was a tavern of note in the capital city of Cormyr â€“ Suzale as of the mid to late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Mare's Tail stood two blocks south from Suzail's grand Promenade , on a street that crossed the Court Close that laid to the west from the establishment. Travelers who walked along the Court Close from the Promenade moving south needed to turn east once they passed Zhaelun's Stockyard . Then moving east past the stockyard and two next buildings, they reached the Mare's Tail on the street's northern side. Across from it, to the south, stood Taneth's Feasthall .</p>
