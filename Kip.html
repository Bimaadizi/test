<p>Kip was a young cat-shifter with a mysterious power who lived on Alaron in the Moonshae Isles prior to him becoming a vessel for the rebirth of the god Malar in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He had calico hair and cat eyes. He was further cat-like in that he was diminutive and quick, and had retractable fingernails.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Kip was shy, with a tentative smile and childlike voice. He was fastidious yet craved physical contact and comfort. He hated getting wet, so much so that he would dress for stormy weather while on a boat even if the weather was perfectly clear. Even so, he liked being clean, and would yearn for a bath if he went too long without.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He had a unique empathic ability: if he touched a creature, he could immerse himself into their subconscious and their dreams, guiding his own consciousness to ask questions and explore the answers. This allowed him to interrogate those who were asleep, or to probe the minds of others for their current emotions.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Chauntean priestess Marikke was like a mother to Kip, and had cared for him through great hardship. The pair of them became the newest members of the crew of the Sphinx on its final voyage.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early Life</h3>
<p>Kip was born in an isolated cottage on the island of Alaron , but lost his family when he was very young. They were killed by commonfolk who mistook the shifter family (perhaps willfully) for lycanthropes . Starving and near death, he was taken in by Marikke, who struggled in poverty to care for the child. They eventually found their way to Caer Callidyrr, where Kip was so scared and overwhelmed on his first visit that he had to shut his eyes and have Marikke lead him by the hand.</p>
<p>One spring in the late 1470s DR, Marikke left Kip at an inn she could not afford as she desperately sought work. This was when she met Lukas , captain of the Sphinx , who recruited her as a healer for an upcoming job after he learned of her and Kip's plight. Kip joined the crew as well, although he hated getting wet.</p>
<h3>Capture</h3>
<p>The Sphinx had to escort Lord Aldon Kendrick to the ruins of Caer Corwell in Sarifal , but they were greeted there by High Lady Ordalf , the ruler of Sarifal, who killed Aldon. Instead of killing the crew, she tasked them with killing her half-sister, Lady Amaranth , who led a group of lycanthropes on the island of Moray . During these interactions, the High Lady Ordalf expressed her disdain for shifters to Kip's face, but then also expressed hatred for him specifically. After compelling him to touch her finger, she was able to deduce his empathic powers. This made her realize that he was the key to fulfilling a prophecy for the return of Malar, who was "dead" but worshiped by the Black Blood tribe on Moray. Thinking that she would not mind if Malar were to arise and kill Amaranth instead of the crew of the Sphinx , she contacted Argon Bael , a Malarite angel of vengeance , and coordinated signals to let him know that Kip was coming to Moray.</p>
<p>Aboard the Sphinx a few days later, Kip questioned the judgement of the rest of the crew, wondering why they did not try to fight the High Lady. That same day, the crew became separated when the ship was sunk by fire nagas on its approach to Moray, and Kip was captured by Argon Bael alongside Marikke and another crewmate, the Savage .</p>
<h3>Revival of Malar</h3>
<p>Kip and the others were taken to the city below Scourtop and into Malar's tomb , where Argon Bael revealed that both Marikke and Kip were needed for the success of the ritual to revive his god. He subjected Marikke to torture in order to compel Kip to touch Malar's corpse and dive into its mind. Kip did so, and was shocked to find himself in a vision of a sunny meadow confronted with Malar's consciousness represented only by a black kitten. Meanwhile, Marikke and the Savage, in accordance with the will of Chauntea, killed Argon Bael, whose death served as the final sacrifice needed to revive Malar. Kip's body became the revived god's vessel, subsuming the boy's personality entirely as he stood up with a black kitten his hand. Marikke was kept alive to serve him, still hoping that Kip's identity had somehow survived, but she was ultimately torn apart by order of "Kip" when she helped the Savage to escape a few days later rather than kill him.</p>
<p>From his new body, Malar rallied the lycanthropes across Moray to capture, kill, and torture the humans who lived on the island, and to lay siege to Caer Moray . However, from the moment of Marikke's death, the god was constantly bothered by prayers and calls for "mother" that escaped from Kip's buried consciousness and even forced their way onto the god's lips. Finally, as the boy's body deteriorated under Malar's overexertions and as his despair caused the god's eyes to cry involuntarily, Malar decided to be rid of Kip for good. He ordered his werewolf entourage to tear Kip's flesh to pieces, allowing his revived bestial form to emerge. Some of Kip's skin continued to cling to the Beastlord's haunches.</p>
