<p>Dust of disappearance was a magical substance that could be used to turn a number of creatures temporarily invisible.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Dust of disappearance resembled very fine metallic dust. It was common for it to be found in small silk packets or pouches that contained enough of it for a single use. It was also known to be stored in bone tubes. The powder resembled fine sand , and appeared to be metallic and fine.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Upon throwing the dust up in the air, it rendered all creatures and objects within a 10‑foot (3‑meter) radius invisible for a few minutes. The magical powder allowed these creatures and their items to bend and reflect light, and they were unable to be detected by even magical means. For each individual creature, the invisibility could be cut short if the subject cast a spell or performed an attack or aggressive action.</p>
<p>The effect resembled the greater invisibility spell, and could not even be detected by magical means such as see invisibility or invisibility purge .</p>
