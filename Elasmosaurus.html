<p>Elasmosaurs ( pronounced : / i l æ s m oʊ ˈ s ɑːr ʌ s / ee-læs-mo-SAR-us ) were a type of aquatic dinosaur .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They possessed long snake-like necks and tails and muscular ovoid bodies with fins in place of legs. Elasmosaurs measured 30 feet (9.1 meters) long, with the tail comprising fully half the length, and couldweigh up to 5,000 pounds (2,300 kilograms). Those who sighted only the head or tail from the surface might mistake it for an enormous serpent.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>They were powerful, quick, and had great maneuverability, being able to make sharp turns. Despite their size, they were surprising good at hiding, at least underwater.</p>
<p>Although largely water-dwelling, elasmosaurs were not amphibious and must return to the surface to breathe.</p>
<p>They saw with low-light vision and had a good sense of scent .</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Fintails could be found alone or in pairs, or in herds of 5 to 8 specimens.</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>They hunted by swimming near the surface with their head above water, then dove swiftly to snatch prey. One would attack any creature it came across, lunging forward with its neck and snapping at its prey.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>In the Realms, they could particularly be found in the lake of Moonsea .</p>
