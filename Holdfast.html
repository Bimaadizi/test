<p>Holdfast was a type of powerful enchanted jewelry of the aquatic elven making.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Holdfast amulets were created to be used in hunt and to neutralize invaders. The wearer of the necklace was completely unaffected by hold person spells and similar effects. The same spell could be cast by the wearer twice per day, while more powerful variation – hold monster , once per day.</p>
