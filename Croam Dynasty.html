<p>The Croam Dynasty ruled over the city-state of Westgate from the Year of Clinging Death, 75 DR , until Year of the Cat's Eye, 429 DR . The Croam reign began when Hygaarth Croam was elevated to the throne after King Kergaard Twinblade died of plague without leaving any heirs. The last Croam to hold the title of King abdicated the throne in Year of the King's Destiny, 137 DR , choosing to install the first Croamarkh in his place.</p>
