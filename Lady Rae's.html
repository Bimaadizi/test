<h2>Location</h2>

<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>This establishment only allowed women, or those convincingly disguised as women, to enter. Lady Rae's was meant to be a place of relaxation where women could gather and enjoy a respite from crude comments and lecherous hands. However, some of the clientele of Lady Rae's could be just as rowdy and boisterous as men found in other inns.</p>
