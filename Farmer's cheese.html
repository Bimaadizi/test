<p>Farmer's cheese or whitecurds , also called pot cheese or cottage cheese , was a simple cheese produced by small farming communities across the Realms . It was available for sale through Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Farmer's cheese was little more than the curds of aged milk when separated from its whey with cheesecloth . It was a fresh cheese that did not travel well. For that reason, it had to be consumed locally, and a customer ordering farmer's cheese from Aurora's Catalogue would receive cheese from the closest location available, in order to guarantee a fresh product.</p>
<p>The cheese was suggested to be served with salt and pepper or with cream as a side dish.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>The Maid of the Moors restaurant in Mornbryn's Shield served fresh garden salad awash in whitecurds.</p>
