<p>Teirflin Armgo was the son of Sinnafain and Tos'un Armgo .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Teirflin kept his head shaved. He fought with two swords.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1484 DR , Teirflin and his sister Doum'wielle Armgo held a duel to see who would inherit their father's sentient sword, Khazid'hea . Doum'wielle won the duel by using a spell, which Teirflin considered cheating. Enraged and fueled on by the sword's psychic intrusions, Teirflin stole Khazid'hea and tried to kill Doum'wielle with it as she slept. She awoke and managed to wrest the sword from his hands, but, at the urging of the sword, impaled her brother.</p>
