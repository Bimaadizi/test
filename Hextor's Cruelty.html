<h2>Powers</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The mysterious trio of Hextor-blessed weapons dated back to the time of pre- Weeping War Myth Drannor . All trees ended up being stashed in three armored chests within the Halls of Stone of the Dwarven Dungeons of the City of Song. The chests were secured and protected from lock picking and other attempts of retrieving their contents. Eventually, Dwarven Dungeons' entirety was sealed off during the destruction of Myth Drannor in 714 DR to protect the dwarven tombs, artifacts, and several evil and malicious magical items hidden within. The dungeons would end up being unsealed by 1369 DR , and subsequently, a trio of orc rogues found the keys to liberate Hextor's vicious arms.</p>
