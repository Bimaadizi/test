<p>Skoond's Run was the strait in the Sea of Swords that separated the island of Thelve from the three islands to the south â€“ Arthoum , Nairn's Tomb , and Askalet .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Skoond's Run and the islands that surrounded it were located to the west from Candlekeep , a library-fortress on the Sword Coast North . Several natural and man-made harbors we built along Skoond's Run, away from rocks and harsh winds of the Racewind Passage</p>
