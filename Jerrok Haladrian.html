<p>Jerrok Haladrian was a renowned bard , musician, and a performer of Myth Drannor who build and enchanted his Concert Hall but fell during the Weeping War .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Jerrok Haladrian was an accomplished spell-caster who masterfully enchanted the nodes of power in the concert hall's chorus stands, and later weaved a powerful protective spell in an attempt to save the Concert Hall from the invading Army of Darkness .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Jerrok was confident in the Concert Hall's defenses so this was where he kept his most valuable possessions such as his lyre of building .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the final stretch of the Weeping War , Jerrok assembled the city's best surviving bards in his Concert Hall to weave a powerful protective spell to ward themselves off the invading Army of Darkness. As the bards' spell reached its crescendo, a powerful yugoloth , Hastim of the Gentle Rebuke , forced its way past the not-yet-solid barriers and started murdering the spell-singers. That caused the spell to backfire, petrifying all the creatures inside the hall.</p>
<p>In 1369 DR , the statues inside the hall, including petrified Jerrok Haladrian himself, still held their note, loudly singing, even though the song was more reminiscent of a scream. Most treasure seekers that were brave enough to go inside Jerrok's Concert Hall faced a chance of going mad from the sound of arcane scream-singing and the possibility of being petrified.</p>
