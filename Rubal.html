<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mordrayn led her sect of the Cult of the Dragon to occupy the ruins of the ancient elven city of Myth Drannor in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR . She tapped into the magics of a pool of radiance that grew underneath Castle Cormanthor and corrupted the city's mythal . A group of heroes assembled by Elminster made their way into the ruin and disposed of several cultist groups, including Rubal and his men. Later, Kya Mordrayn became suspicious of the lack of reports from Rubal and several other lieutenants, realizing that there was a group of heroes working against her in the City of Song.</p>
