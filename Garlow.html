<p>Garlow was a lifelong servant and an attendant who worked for the owner of a large townhome in Baldur's Gate and eventually inherited it sometime before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Garlow spent most of his life working in his master's home in the Lower City . His lifelong service was rewarded with the master died. Garlow inherited the entire mansion. Despite the inheritance, Garlow found himself consumed by the regret of a life wasted. He penned a journal he simply called "Inklings" and made a bucket list for his own retirement: to climb a tree , have a truly exceptional sandwich , spend day just reading, visit the City of Splendors, Waterdeep , get a massage, go for a swim in the River Chionthar , buy a new coat, and lastly, get a cat . Later, Garlow decided to leave the manse behind and leave for Calimshan to spend the rest of his life traveling from there. He left a kind letter to whoever would claim "Old Garlow's Place," asking them to take care of the place that was his entire life. However, the place was not cared for; it remained abandoned in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR when it was inspected by Ardent Low , the Council of Four Liaison, who proclaimed it to be in gross violation of the city by-laws 38a-39c and condemned in accordance with by-law 42a. Liaison Low left a notice on Garlow's home, and recommended the owner to contact the local Builder's Guild representative in regards of immediate repairs.</p>
