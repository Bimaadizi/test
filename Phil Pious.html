<p>Phil Pious was a paladin in service of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart some years before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Phil Pious and his enchanted fortress shield made a footnote in history when the paladin stood alone against an army of hobgoblin and kobold archer marauders. The shield, as tall as a man, protected Phil from the missiles and when the marauders ran out of ammunition, the paladin slew them in close combat. In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the weapon ended up available for sale at the Adventurer Mart in Athkatla 's Waukeen's Promenade .</p>
