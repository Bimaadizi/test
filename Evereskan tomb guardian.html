<p>Evereskan tomb guardians were an order of elven warriors and spellcasters that watched over and protected the final resting places of Evereska 's most revered ancestors.</p>
<h2>Admission</h2>
<p>Those who sought to become tomb guardians had to have some degree of arcane spellcasting capability, combat ability, and skills in tracking, stealth, and alertness. They were typically sorcerers who trained as a ranger or rogue .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>To the elves of Evereska, nothing was more sacred than the remains of their deceased forebears and great heroes, interred within countless tombs scattered around their ancestral home in the Western Heartlands . Tomb guardians took a special oaths to protect these sacred places and hunt down, punish, and even kill any scavengers or tomb robbers that would defile their sacred crypts—even if they had to chase them to the ends of the world.</p>
<p>Tombs east of Evereska, on the border of the Anauroch desert, were frequently patrolled by tomb guardians, as they were a regular target of human and humanoid tomb robbers. Some tombs belonged to hated long-dead elven families, but nonetheless the tomb guardians upheld their oaths to protect these burial places.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Tomb guardian continued to hone their arcane spellcasting abilities an cultivated a wide range of skills related to their duty. They did not travel far from their home in the Western Heartlands to continue their studies.</p>
<p>Novice guardians knew they had a sacred duty to watch over the long-deceased citizens of Evereska. Thanks to this nature of their mission, a beginner tomb guardian had an edge when it came to stalking their quarry within the borders of Evereska, whether by tracking, gaining information, or hunting them down. If inside a tomb itself, they became ever more fierce warriors.</p>
<p>More experienced tomb guardian's retained their edge in tracking and pursuing tomb robbers beyond Evereska's tombs and outside of the city's borders. As they honed their skills and combat prowess, they excelled at dodging attacks.</p>
<p>Veteran tomb guardians could track any creature whilst moving at full speed across land. A supremely skilled tomb guardian could make themself the dedicated guardian of a certain area. After ten minutes or so of dedicated focus, they attuned themself their surroundings and became much more alert and stealthy within 100 ft (30 m) of their point of focus.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>At times, the Tomb Guardians were known to work alongside the justices of weald and woe , the special agents of Eldreth Veluuthra .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point, contingent of Tomb Guardians led an unsuccessful mission to explore the depths of Shaalkar Manor believed to be a remnant of House Vyshaan , but were forced to flee after losing a handful of their members.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , a contingent of Evereskan Tomb Guardians under the leadership of Galaeron Nihmedu apprehended a group of Vaasans led by the enigmatic Melegaunt Tanthul underneath the Desert Border South region of Anauroch. During their encounter, magic cast by Galaeron reacted with shadow magic cast by Melegaunt and a hole in the Sharn Wall and "inadvertently" let the phaerimm loose on Faerûn .</p>
