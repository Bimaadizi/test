<p>Olandus Cragmire was a lich and a member of the once-noble Cragmire family of Neverwinter .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Olandus held onto a magical copy of Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue , a philter of the waters of Elah'zad , and a lantern of revelation , all kept in a magically sealed coffer.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the early 14 th century DR , the Cragmires formed a dark necromantic cult that schemed to take over Neverwinter and the entirety of the Sword Coast . When they were destroyed by Neverwintan forces in the Year of the Adder, 1328 DR , Olandus was sealed within the Cragmire Barrow , along with some of their undead army.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , having learned of the valuable artifacts Olandus kept within the Forgotten Vault, Elder Reader Laris sent an adventurer to retrieve them. Upon reaching Olandus after defeating many of his guardians, the lich was impressed with the adventurer's power, and quizzed them about the fate of his once-noble family. If the adventurer answered incorrectly, they were faced with a final guardian bone golem ; if they answered correctly, they were free to pass through and collect the coffer containing the artifacts.</p>
