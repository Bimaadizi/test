<p>A drachma ( pl : drachmae pl : drachmas ) was a type of silver coin foreign to Toril , originating from a collection of city-states on another world that were known for their daring philosophies. [ speculation ] Among those people it was commonly abbreviated as DR.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Drachmae were made from silver and weighed 2.9 ounces (82 grams).</p>
<h2>Value</h2>
<p>While valued at an equivalent exchange to other silver coins , among the city-states they originated from drachmae, filled the role of a gold piece in terms of value.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , a small-time thief in Dhaztanar by the name of Anton Tikizaras attempted to con a group of adventurers by playing on their sympathies. He fabricated a story about a brother-in-law, saying he was supposed to deliver a cartload of silk rugs to a merchant named "Faroud" (a common name in Dhaztanar) in the city's Madinat quarter, but the brother instead robbed Anton blind and sailed away with the silk, heading west to the country of Murghom . Eventually the players agreed to pose as his distant cousins and accompany him to the silk merchant, secretly one of his compatriots.</p>
<p>They met in a dingy little shop, off a small alley in the heart of Madinat. There Anton assured "Faroud", a smuggler , that the foreigners would be willing to buy his stock of smuggled in wine in order to pay off his debts. He haggled the price for a bit for show, then put down a bag of drachmas as a down payment, signaling to one of his other criminal companions to leave the room.</p>
<p>Sometime around the late 14 th century DR , a Zhentarim splinter-group called the Flight of Arrows traveled to the city of Ravens Bluff to seek asylum. Among their number was Jeridal , an experienced young lady, who alongside her allies escaped from the inn they were being kept in at Crow's End with a cone of silence so she could spend some drachmas at the local marketplace.</p>
