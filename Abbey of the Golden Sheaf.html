<p>The Abbey of the Golden Sheaf was a structure devoted to Chauntea located in Mistledale in 1367Â DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Abbey lay along the Holy Road just north of the Moonsea Ride and west of Ashabenford and the River Ashaba .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The structure consisted of a large walled compound with a dozen separate triangular-shaped fields that spread outward from the center. A spired abbey stood in the center of the fields. Paths circled the abbey and cut each field into quadrants. A main road followed the inside perimeter of the main exterior wall. The exterior wall was earthen and covered with vines. A small strip of land where herbs were planted separated the ends of the fields with the wall.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>An extensive network of underground granaries were found beneath the abbey. The floor of the main spired structure was packed earth to encourage the growth of vines and creepers. The scent of fresh flowers and other vegetation permeated the interior of the abbey, especially during the warmer months of the year.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Though one of the smaller abbeys of Chauntea, the Abbey of the Golden Sheaf served the entire dale well. The clergy spent their time tending the countless crops and gardens, while also performing public and private ceremonies in worship to Chantea. The abbey earned a considerable portion of its income from selling rare seeds from the Mhair Jungles and Chult .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Reverend Brother Derim Whiteshield ran the Abby of the Golden Sheaf during the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . Watchful Sister of the Earth Alena represented the abbey on the Council of Six .</p>
<p>Countless wasps, giant centipedes , bees , and snakes lived within the outer wall.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The Abbey of the Golden Sheaf was rumored to have enough food stored within its granaries to feed the entire population of the Dalelands for years, and enough hidden wealth to buy them all many times over. It was believed these rumors were the cause of Lashan Aumersair striking for Mistledale before attacking other regions of the Dalelands.</p>
