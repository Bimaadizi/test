<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Until 1357 DR , she remained at the Wanton Wyvern tavern.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She was an acquaintance of Mirt and a Harper . She'd also developed a minor grudge for the innkeeper, Thomd , who often physically shoved her away from the gate. The short time she spent around Delg Ironstar , she responded quite intensely to his words. During their parting, she told him she'd have a cake of soap waiting for him next time.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1357 DR , Baergasra was snooping at the Wanton Wyvern 's gate, disguised as a leper, when Mirt , Shandril Shessair , Delg Ironstar and Narm Tamaraith entered the inn. After their fight with a local Zhentarim blade, Osber , Narm became poisoned. As a favor to Mirt, Baergasra broke her cover and healed the poison on Narm's body. She also took the opportunity to scare Thomd, who believed her to be a leper. She took a bath shortly afterwards, where she removed half a year's worth of dirt, strongly implying she'd been in disguise for about that long. During the bath, she claimed to be following orders, strongly implying it was someone else's plan that she disguise herself as a beggar. She also revealed to them that, for about three rides, magic had become unreliable. She also revealed that Osber only had three of his henchmen with him; the other three were spending time with some women, and two of those women happened to be Harpers. She also griped that she'd have to cut her hair.</p>
<p>She spent the night with Mirt afterwards. On parting, she gave Shandril some scented spices she used on her hair, which threw scent-trackers such as bloodhounds away from her trail.</p>
