<p>Brawn Mc Gable was a human bandit who settled in Phandalin during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Brawn had a sharp tongue and a winning smile. He was an affable man who got along well with most people. He was willing to share details about his past only with folk whom he liked.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>After he settled down in Phandalin, Brawn mostly did odd jobs around town. His people skills made him a natural deal broker and entertainer, and combined with his penchant for keeping an eye on local comings and goings, he had the makings of a talented spy.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A middle-aged Brawn arrived in Phandalin in the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR , to join the Redbrand Ruffians , a local gang who terrorized the town at the time. As a member, he became well acquainted with their headquarters beneath Tresendar Manor . While he was involved with the gang's intimidation of the people of Phandalin, he never directly participated in their more heinous crimes. This may only have been because the Redbrands were driven out of town by a group of adventurers shortly after he joined.</p>
<p>Following the Redbrands' defeat, Brawn was arrested and sentenced to toil on a local work gang as punishment for his crimes. During this time, his winning personality earned him acceptance among the people of Phandalin, and he was thus able to stay in town after his release. By the Year of the Duplicitous Courtier, 1496 DR , he had settled in as one of the townsfolk.</p>
