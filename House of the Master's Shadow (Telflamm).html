<p>The House of the Master's Shadow was a temple of Mask in Telflamm . The House served as the headquarters of the local thieves guild, led by the Shadowmasters of Telflamm .</p>
<p>The House looked like any other temple in Telflamm, except that it had no locks. There was no point in locks considering the worshipers here were Shadowmasters and followed the god of thieves. Everyone else in town knew better than to try to take something from this temple.</p>
