<p>The Srinshee (born Oluevaera Estelda ) was once a baelnorn but was reborn as a mortal elf once more, either sun or moon . She aided three Cormanthyran Coronals : Miirphys , Tannivh , and Eltargrim and all three trusted her implicitly. She helped raise the Mythal over the elven city of Myth Drannor in 261 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Oluevaera Estelda was once the matriarchal ruler of Clan Srinshee and lived in the elven city of Ylraphon before its destruction by drow and orc . From the fires of Ylraphon's fall she earned the title of savior of Yrlaphon's Survivors as she led them to safety in Cormanthor . As the last member of Clan Srinshee she took the title of The Srinshee .</p>
<p>The Srinshee played a vital role in the creation of the Mythal of Myth Drannor in 261 DR amid the ruins of the shattered court of the Coronal after she ended the madness of the Starym -led attack (which was an attempt to hinder the plans of Coronal Eltargrim). She led Mythanthor, Coronal Eltargrim Irithyl, Lady Ahrendue Echorn , Lord Earynspieir Ongluth , and another ten mages to create the magical ward.</p>
<p>The year Year of the Bloody Tusk, 661 DR marked the death of Coronal Eltargrim. He left only one heir behind, Aravae Irithyl , who also passed in Year of the Falling Petals, 664 DR , leaving a ruling vacuum behind her. In Year of Stern Judgment, 666 DR there was an unrest amongst the Noble Houses to determine the next Coronal of Myth Drannor and Cormanthyr in a claiming ceremony . After forty elves and the Rule Tower itself were destroyed, the Srinshee stepped in, easily swinging the elfblade free of its perch. The events of the claiming ceremony had broken The Srinshee heart and she was weary and frustrated by the acts of the Noble Houses, as such she spoke a prophecy into being for those living in the city:</p>
<p>As it was brandished before her, the golden light of the blade crystallized around her and a quartet of High Mages in a massive diamond-shaped energy field that engulfed and restored the Rule Tower. The Srinshee said her last teachings to all the inhabitants of Cormannthyr about brothership and hope:</p>
<p>Finally, with a whirl of magic, the golden diamond magical field, the Srinshee herself, the four High Mages, and the Rulers' Blade , Ar'Cor'Kerym disappeared, leaving the city without its most powerful defenders.</p>
<p>The Srinshee retreated to a hidden resting place whose location was known only by Alvaerele Tasundrym and was not seen again until Year of the Haunting, 1377 DR . It was then that she returned to a rejuvenated Myth Drannor and offered Ilsevele Miritar the Ruler's Blade. 711 years after she disappeared, waiting for a coronal to rule the realm, a worthy one had finally appeared.</p>
<p>In Year of the Rune Lords Triumphant, 1487 DR , she fought to defend Myth Drannor once more, this time from the besieging forces of Thultanthar and here she would sacrifice herself to stop Larloch from becoming the new deity of magic.</p>
