<p>Jonstal Halavur was a merchant from Var who later built his fortune in Amn during the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Similar to Ladrelas Tranth , Jonstal traveled to Athkatla in order to enrich himself. At the end of the Tethyrian Interregnum he also put effort into putting his investments in promising Tethyrian nobles who he believed would provide long-term stability. His money allowed for the construction of inns, bridges, roads, warehouses, workshops, and other forms of infrastructure that Tethyr needed, and ensured the rise of the particular nobles who he believed would be sensible stewards of the realm. Thanks in part to his intervention, Tethyr enjoyed a rapid recovery from the destruction of the civil war.</p>
