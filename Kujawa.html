<p>Kujawa was an Imaskari human artificer and later emperor of Anok-Imaskar , reigning from −2487 DR to −1943 DR . Some sources, such as the biographer Awagi Nukichi , referred to him as Joon Tsao Choo , and conflated him with the later Emperor Tan Chin .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Kujawa carried one of the False Imaskarcana , namely Dhonas's Shroud .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The western Imaskar Empire collapsed in −2488 DR , but the eastern provinces of Khati and Katakoro emerged relatively unscathed. Thus, within a year, Kujawa claimed the Dragon Throne in the Khati city of Thakos (the former capital of Upper Imaskar ). With that, he declared himself Emperor and founded a new realm, Anok-Imaskar.</p>
<p>Anok-Imaskar was prosperous and quickly spread east, north, and south across Kara-Tur. Eventually, circa −2300 DR , Kujawa decided to found a second capital city to better govern the new southern lands his nation had claimed. The new capital was called Tempat Larang . The emperor ordered the great Larang Highway be built along existing frontier outposts into the Shao Mountains. Many great magical scrolls and artifacts were traded from Tempat Larang to the empire during his regin.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the nearby volcano Mount Bakos erupted in −2113 DR , covering Tempat Larang in ash and lava, and the city had to be evacuated. Over the following decades, the empire's southwestern lands were also abandoned. According to later accounts, the emperor thought this disaster was an omen from the gods, and hence abandoned his plans for the south, even erasing them from official records. Thus only vague legends of Tempat Larang survived.</p>
<p>Kujawa repeated the history of his former peers in Imaskar when he died fighting the celestial dragon T'ien Lung in −1943 DR . His death caused the empire to collapse.</p>
