<p>Infra-lanterns were a special kind of lantern that greatly boosted a creature's existing infravision .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>An infra-lantern looked almost exactly like a hooded lantern , except that instead of a wick the lantern had a faceted gem . Instead of emitting light, an infra-lantern worked by emitting almost imperceptible vibrations.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The gem inside an infra-lantern was enchanted by drow magic, sometimes called dweomercraft . For that reason, it lost its powers if exposed to sunlight.</p>
<p>Infra-lanterns were generally not useful for creatures without infravision , since the vibrations emitted could only be detected by someone who already had this capability. Some variants allowed creatures to see by infravision up to a range of 90 ft (27 m), while other variants had the effect of greatly sharpening the visual acuity of those creatures, allowing them to better discern shapes in the dark.</p>
<p>Infra-lanterns were extremely rare, but were sometimes available for purchase through Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue by special order.</p>
