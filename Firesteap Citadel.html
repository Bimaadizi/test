<p>Firesteap Citadel was a military fortress in the Firesteap Mountains on the eastern side of the Lake of Steam and under the control of the city-state of Innarlith in the midâ€“14 th century DR . It marked the southern boundary of the territory controlled by Innarlith. It was used as a base of operations by Senator Pristoleph when he launched his invasion to overthrow the government of the city-state in 1371 DR.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Pristoleph , the future Ransar of Innarlith, served as a soldier in the Innarlan military at the citadel around 1334 DR . There he operated a brothel with his friend Wenefir , using a prostitute named Nyla to serve the officers of the camp. Ptolnec , a lieutenant, took issue with this and tried to stop him before discovering that his own superior was using its services.</p>
<p>Pristoleph became a wealthy senator and he had ambitions becoming the Ransar of Innarlith. In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , he purchased the post of castellan for the castle and took control of it. He then secretly raised an army at the castle, including a large body of wemic mercenaries from the Shaar to the south. Ransar Salatis became aware of Pristoleph's ambitions and sent a spirit naga assassin to kill Pristoleph and his wife Phyrea at the citadel. The assassin came to Phyrea's room at night and tried to kill her, but Pristoleph discovered the creature and used his abilities as a fire genasi to scorch the assassin, who escaped out of the window.</p>
<p>Pristoleph and his army proceeded to make their assault on the city, which after a year-long siege they took control of in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR .</p>
