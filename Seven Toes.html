<h2>Description</h2>
<p>By his own admission, he was not a particularly tough man.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Seven Toes was supposed to rendezvous with Xalliana at the Broken Crown inn on the High Road , but she never showed up and he feared she'd killed by the Blackdagger Bandits . After meeting up with a famed adventurer from Neverwinter , who'd been sent by Sergeant Alphonse Knox to help the Harpers against the Blackdaggers, Seven Toes asked them to look for Xalliana. Seven Toes gave the adventurer Xalliana's description to check the bodies of the Blackdaggers' victims along the High Road and to talk with Old Lenn if there was a recent shipwreck. With Old Lenn's aid, the adventurer found Xalliana and the Harpers could investigate further the activities of the Blackdagger Bandits.</p>
