<p>The Thousandheads Trading Coster was a merchant company in Faer√ªn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bharavan Bhaerkantos , a former adventurer, founded this merchant company. The Thousandheads Trading Coster only operated on trade routes from Waterdeep to Hillsfar via Scornubel , Berdusk , Iriaebor , Priapurl , Arabel , and Essembra . Although the noble Ruldegost family of Waterdeep owned sixty percent of the company, Lady Kara Ruldegost allowed Bharavan mostly free reign to operate the business as he saw fit. However, her brother, Lord Bly Ruldegost , spent a great amount of time getting to know the business and the political environment around Riatavin .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>Bharavan's personal stronghold, located just east of Riatavin, served as the base of operations for this company. They maintained an office in Scornubel as well.</p>
