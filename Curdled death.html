<p>Curdled death was among the most potent and deadly of magical , aromatic oils in the Realms.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Any weak living creature that came within 5 feet (1.5 meters) of the wearer would potentially fall dead in their tracks. Creatures that were magical in nature, extraplanar , or undead were unaffected by the fragrance.</p>
<p>The magical effect of an application of this aroma remained potent for around one to three minutes, after which time it would evaporate from the wearer.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>Reptilla Half-elven modified her curdled death oil to incapacitate rather than kill, and to evaporate into a breathable substance when exposed to high temperatures. She daubed her curdled death on rock faces along mountain paths around her lair. As the stone warmed under the daylight sun, the curdled death activated and knocked out passers-by, so she could take her victims alive.</p>
