<p>Tunics were a kind of garment , worn on the body, that came in a variety of styles and materials. Also known as cotes (or cottes ), they could be found almost anywhere on Toril , from the True World of Maztica , west of the Trackless Sea , to the mystical lands of Kara-Tur , far to the east of Faerûn . Even in the treacherous Underdark , and everywhere in between, tunics were used as a simple and reliable piece of outerwear.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A cote could be made either with or without sleeves, and, depending on the garment's length, typically reached to the ankles or knees. After donning their tunic by maneuvering it over their head, however, the wearer could further cinch their silhouette at the waist by use of a girdle . Cottes were generally best suited for temperatures of around 50 ℉ (10 ℃ ) to 70 ℉ (21 ℃ ), but they could be supplemented in colder weather through the use of surcoats , among other things.</p>
<p>One exemplary style of tunic was the cotehardie. This elegant cote was designed to fit closely to the wearer's body, worn with flared and short sleeves, and could be found—alongside other varieties—in the city of Waterdeep , often as a garment of either gender . In the mid–14 th century DR , men styled their cotehardies atop a jupon with longer sleeves, alongside hose , and their tunics with breeches ; women preferred to wear either their cottes or cotehardies over their skirts, or possibly, if a plain tunic, under their bliaut .</p>
<p>Others, of Kara-Turan origin, included the Shou maitung , which went down to the floor, or the linen cotes of T'u Lung . Similar tunics of white linen were even worn while laboring in Koryo .</p>
<h3>Ornaments</h3>
<p>Cottes could also be embellished in a variety of ways, such as with small gems , known as jasmals , that were cut to resemble glowing orbs of orange. Bearing certain flowers , too, could impact the way a tunic was received. In Cormyr , for one, it was considered a show of affluence to wear a bloodrose upon one's cote, given the flower's rarity, and its parasitic twin often served a similar purpose upon the tunic of an undead of notable power.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Cottes were already in use by −339 DR , during the bygone days of Netheril , and survived past it to 650 DR , where they were often worn by the dwarves , halflings , and gnomes of Myth Drannor . Although these wore tunics of muslin , the elves shamelessly preferred nearly translucent fabric for their own cotes.</p>
<p>Still more centuries later, tunics and linen cottes were sold by Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue , though both were listed as separate items. The former cost only 1 gp , and it was demanded that the client specify a size for it to be made in, whereas the latter's price depended on a variety of factors. Cotes made for humans and elves cost the most, at 7 and 6 gp, respectively, then gnomes, at 3 gp, and halflings, lastly, at only 4 sp. Whilst Aurora's Emporium offered black, brown, tan, and white cottes, a customer could request they be dyed a particular color, though this incurred a doubling of the cost. Elaborate, gold filigree could also be embroidered into them for another 4 sp.</p>
<p>As noted within the infamous guides of Volothamp Geddarm , however, Aurora's was far from the only purveyor of tunics. Cotes were also sold in the Barbaric North by the Amphailan ladies of Imbryl's Cloaks and by the proprietors of Winter Winds , a shop in Yartar . The latter's products were more fashionable, and, thus, expensive. Tunics of a similar quality—and cost—could be bought at Chalasse's Fine Clothing , all the way in the Cormyrean town of Immersea , where the local style dictated the cottes be made with slashed sleeves.</p>
<p>Even the people of Maztica , an ocean apart from the mainland of Faerûn, had, at some point, invented the tunic. Though they had plain cotes, which were valued at 100 cb , the Mazticans also wore a unique, feather-bearing tunic. At a cost of 10 gq , this particular style of cotte was worth fifty times as much as the standard one.</p>
