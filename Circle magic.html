<p>Circle magic was an especially potent form of collaborative spellcasting most often associated with the realms of the Unapproachable East , but was practiced all across Toril . It allowed for these casters to effective increase the potency of their arcane or divine spells , by channeling the power of multiple casters through one individual.</p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>By utilizing the power of circle magic, casters could attain feats of magic they could not as a lone practitioner. Some of the most spectacular uses of arcane magic have historically come by means of circle magic.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>When performing circle magic, a circle leader would stand within the center of the prepared spellcasting area. Anywhere from two to nine additional casters would encircle them, depending on the power of the circle leader.</p>
<p>To begin, the participants would spend one hour empowering the circle leader in preparation for the casting. They would then each cast a single spell that would contribute to a pool of power that could be used to bolster the circle spell with additional effects, such as increased spellcasting potency for the circle leader or metamagic effects for the spell to be cast. This additional power would remain with the circle leader for up to a single day, or until it was utilized in a casting.</p>
<h3>War Spells</h3>
<p>Following the Spellplague magic could also be used as a ritual to cast more-powerful offensive magic in minutes time rather than over the course of an hour. The benefits of circle magic used in this manner were less-potent than when it was used in other ways.</p>
