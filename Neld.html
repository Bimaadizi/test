<p>Neld was a hostler at Castle Obarskyr in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was rightly suspicious.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He was the senior hostler.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>On the day after his fight with Mirt , he was going to sport two round, swollen black eyes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Mirt tried to get the hostler to ready a coach for him in the middle of the night after the massacre during the Council of the Dragon in late Mirtul of the 1479Â DR , the senior hostler was reluctant to comply as he spoke like an outlander, demanding a closed coach to a particular place, and named the authority of a high-rank War Wizard without saying which one. His suspicion led to Voruld , a Purple Dragon soldier, to intervene; after Mirt took him down, Neld tried to defend himself. He got punched into the floor twice before he stopped trying to get up, and accepted Mirt's commands.</p>
<p>Neld drove Mirt's coach to the Three Dolphins Door before leaving. Mirt apparently was hitting him all the way.</p>
