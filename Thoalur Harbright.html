<h2>Abilities</h2>

They were occasionally given a reprieve by other members of the Harbrights. On his shifts, he was in charge of a company of over forty mercenary guards plus dozens of servers, escorts, coin keepers (folks who ran the games), tellers, and stablehands.</p>

<p>Thoalur was the nephew of Drengar Harbright , proprietor of the High Flagon inn and gambling hall for the Harbright family that was located just up the road.
