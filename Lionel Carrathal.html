<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Lionel was the son and heir of Brynth Carrathal , the bastard son of King Reginald Carrathal and an Amnian woman.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After King Reginald's death in the Year of the Bloodbird, 1346 DR , the Carrathal Dynasty fell out of power, however the line of succession passed to Brynth in Amn. When Brynth died in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Lionel became the heir. From Amn, he plotted to restore the Carrathal Dynasty.</p>
<p>Following the turn of the 15 th century DR, around the same time that Amn was spreading its influence in the Moonshae Isles and was being blamed for stoking civil unrest against the Kendrick family, Lionel was making known his claim to be the "true" High King of the United Moonshae Isles . Amn would go on to annex the island of Snowdown in the Year of the Sceptered One, 1404 DR , and in the Year of the Halls Unhaunted, 1407 DR , agents of Lionel Carrathal were blamed for the mysterious death of High Queen Alicia Kendrick , with many believing she had been poisoned in service of his claim to the throne. His loyalist insurgents in Callidyrr were subsequently defeated by the Callidyrr dragoons .</p>
