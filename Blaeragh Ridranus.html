<h2>History</h2>
<p>Blaeragh Ridranus was one of the Zhentarim operatives present at Warmfires House in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , during the attempted assassination of the scrivener Maervidal Iloster . After the scribe was poisoned, Calivar Murpeth sent him and Taerach Thone after him at the jakes. There, they came across a harlot, Talantha , whom Ridranus largely ignored, but Thone found suspicious. He hired her, and brought her upstairs with Calivar, who paralyzed her with a sip of poisoned wine. Ridranus helped Thone with the torture-interrogation there.</p>
<p>However, she told Calivar that Ridranus had paid and threatened her to help that scribe escape. He took her at her word, and had him killed by Toarin Klustoon , over her protests. In fact, Ridranus hadn't helped the scribe. It was a fabrication from the woman, who was actually Storm Silverhand in spell-guise.</p>
