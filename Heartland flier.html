<p>The heartland flier was an experimental flying machine developed by Nadul Da Roni in his pursuit for purely mechanical flight.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In addition to the air screw and doubles wheel , Da Roni also developed a small single-person winged vehicle. The user would lay flat on the heartboard and strap their hands and feet into the stirrups. By pedalling their feet and sweeping with their arms (as if performing a breaststroke) the flier's wings would flap quickly and forcefully. If used appropriately (and with more than a little luck) the flier would rise and move forwards surprisingly quickly, though it still took a very strong and tireless person to operate without immediately crashing.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Special orders for many Da Roni inventions could be placed at Aurora's Whole Realms Shop . Nadul Da Roni valued the heartland flier at 75 gold pieces .</p>
