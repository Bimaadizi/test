<p>Tammarast was a minor noble house of Cormyr , circa the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Tammarast family was relatively poor but remained loyal to Cormyr. However, certain laws pertaining to commerce imposed hardships on the family and their vassals.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The family business was raising cattle.</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>Lord Ingleiyr was open to deals and methods that circumvented the rigid laws that reduced his business income. He was not above using his noble status for financial gain, as long as it did not amount to treason.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Tammarast family lands were located between the village of Ghars to the west and the Vast Swamp to the east. Crumbling Landuth Castle and its grounds were at the southern edge of the holdings. Two small settlements and around fourteen farms made up the rest, circa the 1370s DR.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ingleiyr Tammarast was less than twenty years old when he became Lord of Landuth and he inherited a holding in financial trouble. His father lost money attempting to farm water plants that could grow in the Vast Swamp and Ingleiyr was focused on raising cattle as an alternative. He was approached by a Sembian named Chalipur Hathangos about selling his cattle directly to him, but Ingleiyr rejected the proposal because it involved leaving Cormyr and joining Sembia.</p>
