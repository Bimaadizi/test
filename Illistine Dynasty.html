<p>The Illistine Dynasty ruled over the city-state of Westgate from the Year of the Cat's Eye, 429 DR , until Year of the Rolling Heads, 452 DR . The Illistine reign began when Mulsantir Illistine drove the last pirate king out of Westgate and claimed the throne for himself, becoming King Mulsantir I. The Illistine family only held the throne for two generations before a period of violent upheaval when their line was replaced by others who seized the throne by force.</p>
