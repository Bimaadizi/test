<p>The Quasi-Elemental Plane of Lightning , or the Plane of Storms , was the Inner Plane at the intersection of the Elemental Plane of Air and the Positive Energy Plane . It was a place of constant electrical storms and the stench of ozone.</p>
<p>The quasi-elemental Plane of Lightning presents an extreme hazard—the relentless barrage of lightning strikes. Any creature entering this domain without proper protection will be subjected to near-constant electrical discharges. Another peril is elemental thunder, which saturates the realm with an unceasing, deafening rumble capable of splintering rock. The overwhelming roar renders normal speech impossible, and interlopers who fail to use earplugs made of wax or putty risk eventual deafness.</p>
<p>Despite the harsh conditions, breathing is possible, though the air carries a distinct metallic tang. Visibility varies greatly, ranging from 100 to 1,000 yards, depending on atmospheric disturbances.</p>
