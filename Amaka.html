<p>Amaka was a handmaiden of Araushnee who presided over a shrine to her goddess beneath Citadel Umbra in the Moonshae Isles as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was young and beautiful, and looked like a teenager to human sensibilities. She had wide red eyes, a wide mouth, heavy lips, and an arched nose. She wore her white hair cropped, and dressed in white linen tied with a red cord or fastened with a pin.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was starved for the kind of intimate and caring relationships that lovers shared, and that she could not experience among the drow. She was also flirtatious, acting drunken or sensual in situations that did not call for it. She felt strongly that blood and violence were not appropriate ways to appeal to her goddess, and so abhorred her people's willingness to betray and kill those they worked with (and when forced to participate in such treachery, she was left weeping and unsteady with nerves). She seemed woefully naïve about the politics of the wider Moonshae Isles, and was breathlessly excited when speaking about her goddess.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Amaka and her sisters maintained a shrine in the tunnels beneath Citadel Umbra dedicated to Araushnee, which was unusual in its dense use of plants that made the air uncomfortably thick with oxygen . Her theology was confusing to outsiders: a heavy focus was placed on Aurushnee's innocence, including sexual innocence and a distaste for violence, and although she acknowledged Araushnee to be Lolth , she considered them to be two of up to four distinct aspects of her goddess. These four manifestations were: a beautiful elf, a spider , an elf/spider hybrid, and a hypersexualized human woman. She further believed that the guise of "the Spider Queen" was a curse inflicted upon Araushnee by Corellon , and that her goddess could be redeemed to her old self with the help of a greater deity , specifically Chauntea , who could "raise her out of the Abyss ".</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Amaka's father was a warlock and the leader of a drow mercenary army who served Prince Araithe of Sarifal at Citadel Umbra during the 15 th century DR. Her sisters and fellow handmaidens of Araushnee were Chinedu , Kemdelime , and Onyiye , and they in turn were subordinate to a hierophant who operated out of another shrine to the south of Citadel Umbra.</p>
<p>She was fearful of fomorians .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Amaka's clan came into the service of Prince Araithe of Sarifal after his eladrin retainers began to abandon him in the early 15 th century DR. They were serving as his private army by the 1460s DR and were living beneath Citadel Umbra by the 1470s DR. This arrangement allowed for Amaka to build her shrine beneath the Citadel. At the same time, the clan's hierophant to the south tried desperately to summon Araushnee with all the tools and rituals at her disposal, but to no avail. At some point it was suggested that blood of the le Shay royal family of Sarifal might be used to summon her, although Amaka rejected this idea.</p>
<p>In the late 1470s DR, Amaka and her sisters received visions foretelling of Lady Amaranth 's arrival to their shrine via a portal . These visions, seemingly given by the Earthmother, led them to believe that the time of their goddess's return was joyously imminent. Amaka's father, knowing that the Llewyrr elves would be willing to follow Lady AMaranth to overthrow Prince Araithe and his mother , tried to play both sides in order to assure his clan's future. When Amaranth refused to acknowledge his primary demand—that the drow be allowed to live aboveground in the Winterglen and to build a true temple to Araushnee—he decided to trick her into travelling to the shrine of the clan's hierophant to be sacrificed in a ritual to summon the goddess from the Abyss.</p>
<p>Amaka was tasked with guiding Amaranth and her companions to the sacrificial site, although she did so against her will and the journey caused her much anguish. She believed not only that the plan would fail but that Araushnee would be displeased. Even so, she led the group into the trap, but then chose to fight alongside Amaranth when the hierophant's drow ambushed them.</p>
<p>She was next seen by Amaranth's party after they had been captured. She helped Lukas escape his bonds after telling him that she was jealous of the budding relationship between himself and Amaranth. She then whispered words of encouragement to Amaranth with a very different message, namely to embrace her heritage as an immortal le Shay and reject connections to mortals like Lukas. It was then that she revealed herself to be more than a mortal drow, and instead an apparent avatar of Araushnee who had already killed the drow who had captured the party. She departed and allowed them to leave.</p>
