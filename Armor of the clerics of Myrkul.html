<p>Armor of the clerics of Myrkul were sets of enchanted Myrkulyte plate mail worked by the members of the Lord of the Dead's clergy.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These sets of magic armor were enchanted to offer improved protection from several necromantic spells such as paralyze and death magic . Additionally, the armor increased the wearer's fortitude. The armor proved that Myrkulyte priests only dealt in the business of death, showing no desire to join the ranks of the deceased.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before Myrkul 's death during the Time of Troubles , his clerics were adorned in these severe-looking armors as they performed duties of the faith, aiding the dead and dying, organizing funerals, and ruling in the cases of deceased's unfinished affairs and enacting their wills. One of these magic armors fell into the hands of drow merchant of exotic goods – Nym sometime circa the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , as he camped in Icewind Dale 's Wandering Village .</p>
