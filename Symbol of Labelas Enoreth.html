<h2>History</h2>
<p>After completion of construction of Seldarine's Hand circa 900 DR , the inhabitants of the citadel lived in a close alliance with the dwarves of Dorn's Deep. The wizards of the elven citadel and the swerve city were outfitted with the best items created by the crafters of both races. These amulets were specifically crafted to empower young practitioners of the Art, improving their focus and spellcasting. The young wizards outfitted with the Symbols of Labelas Enoreth were commonly used in battles instead of more powerful elder mages who were neck-deep in research and experiments. By 1281 DR , the Seldarine's Hand had been ruined for centuries and came to be known as the Severed Hand. After the citadel's fall, several Symbols of Labelas Enoreth remained in existence and could be found inside the ruins until the Severed Hand was transported to Limbo in 1306 DR .</p>
