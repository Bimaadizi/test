<p>Tsathree's Comforts was a boutique owned by Jhamanthra Tsathree .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Tsathree's Comforts was located on Golden Serpent Street in the North Ward of Waterdeep circa the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This shop gained brief notoriety when Jhamanthra began selling a new scented facial wash she called Waterfall Kiss . It was quickly discovered that skin treated with this product suddenly began to glow a vivid green color a few hours after applying certain cosmetic products to the treated area. The glow lasted for a few hours and then faded, apparently harmlessly. For a time, Waterfall Kiss was in great demand as the Waterdhavian youth with disposable income experimented with the humorous and glamorous application of making other body parts glow.</p>
