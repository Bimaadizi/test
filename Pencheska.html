<p>Pencheska was a succubus in the Doomvault dungeon in 1486 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Pencheska was a succubus summoned by a lich named Tarul Var of the Red Wizards of Thay , who quickly enslaved her.</p>
<p>In 1485 DR, under Tarul's orders, she caused chaos in Daggerford by posing as the human courtesan Natyssa . Adventures ultimately unveiled her. Afterward, Pencheska was relocated to the lich's rooms in the Doomvault dungeon waiting for new orders from her master.</p>
<p>In the late 1480's or early 1490's DR, she conspired with Baroness Wynne Cromm to capture Morwen Daggerford , the duchess of Daggerford. While duchess Morwen was imprisoned in Cromm's Hold , Pencheska posed as the duchess in Daggerford.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Pencheska was unhappy with her situation as a slave of Tarul. She did not immediately attack the lich's enemies.</p>
