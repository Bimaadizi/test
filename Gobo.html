<h2>History</h2>

Afterward, despite the presence of some adventurers in the village, a large group of sohei attacked and executed Gobo for his lack of cooperation.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Gobo was by nature stingy and manipulative. He was subservient to rich people or local officials, but to all others he was stern and inhospitable.</p>
