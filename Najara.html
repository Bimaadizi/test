<p>Najara , a large kingdom in the Western Heartlands , was inhabited by a wide variety of nagas , yuan-ti , and lizardfolk .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It comprised parts of the High Moor , the Forest of Wyrms , and the Marsh of Chelimber , with the Serpent Hills lying in the center.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Not operating as a typical state, its status as a kingdom is a disputed subject.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1474 DR , Jarant killed the previous King of Snakes Ebarnaje , triggering a civil war and increasing yuan-ti and lizardfolk activity in the area. This made Najara more relevant to Elturgard and Evereska .</p>
<p>Due to more nations gaining knowledge of Najara, it became a subject of interest for its many ancient ruins, including some from the Netherese empire and the kingdom of Boareskyr .</p>
<h2>Religion</h2>
<p>The main deity of this land was Sseth , but with some yuan-ti becoming increasingly disappointed in him, they turned to the forbidden, worshiping Zehir .</p>
