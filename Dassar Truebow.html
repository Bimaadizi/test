<p>Dassar was the leader of his own squad of rangers, and aided by his second-in-command Imbross Irri'Karr . He was an associate of Councilwoman Alisara Callum of Helm's Hold and Sergeant Alphonse Knox of the Neverwinter Guard .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Siege of Helm's Hold in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Dassar holed himself up in the outskirts of the Helmite city on the border of the Watcher's Forest along with a few other allies, including the merchant Kella , the hedge wizard Nottin , and Meryth Heartwood . He worked with some adventurers to help take back Helm's Hold from the Ashmadai , leading the efforts to slay the cult's mages , conjurers , and even the erinyes devils that prowled the city streets.</p>
<p>After learning that the Ashmadai cultists had broken into the Crypts of the Vigilant Eye to steal shields of Helm , he aided the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge in reclaiming them from their fiendish clutches. They worked together one more time to kill one of the cult's leaders, a priest by the name of Halas the Pure .</p>
<p>He later led his ranger squad into Roth√© Valley so they could aid the local village from the onslaught of drow slavers. Dassar reunited with his adventurer ally from Helm's Hold and directed them to work with Imbross in order to infiltrate the slavers' camp and bring them down from the inside.</p>
