<p>Hyecho was one of the many isolated villages of the Fochu Peninsula in Wa . It primarily produced baskets (of poor quality).</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hyecho was a tiny, depressing village. Most of the structures within the village were simple peasant shacks known as minka , built from wood with latticed walls and straw-thatched roofs. Apart from these poor residences were small barns, warehouses, and shops.</p>
<p>The people of Hyecho were, as a rule, hateful individuals and un trusting of outsiders to the point of refusing to accept anyone not from the village through their gates. The village had a population of about 150 individuals after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR) .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Hyecho was located on the west coast of the Fochu Peninsula of Tsukishima , north of Fochu , off a spur trail from the Hisano Road .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>

<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The xenophobic citizens of Hyecho refused to trade with anyone from outside their village.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>About 15 citizens of Hyecho served in its militia. These persons were only armed with simple clubs or spears .</p>
<h2>Religion</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed coiled dragon Za-Jikku began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical butterflies , the breath of which would create yun ch'i , the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever.</p>
