<p>Mur-zhaguls , or demon trolls , were planetouched creatures originating from the cross-breeding of trolls and demons .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mur-zhaguls appeared much like normal trolls in form, but their skin was red-orange and mottled and it was covered in scales, not warts. They lacked hair, had long pointed ears, big tusks, and a terrible demonic glow in their eyes.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>While they had enough intelligence to wear armor and carry weapons , most forewent weapons and used their claws to rip opponents to shreds, which they were adept at.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like trolls, mur-zhaguls regenerated injuries and could reattach lost limbs or regrow them in under 18 minutes. Unlike trolls, they were not harmed by fire or acid. Instead, they could only be harmed by holy or blessed weapons.</p>
<p>Mur-zhaguls were also armed with magical powers, able to create darkness , create fire with burning hands , detect good beings, and jump with unnatural skill as often they liked. Thrice a day each, they could create deeper darkness , turn invisible , and protection from good , and once a day they speed themselves or allies as with haste .</p>
<p>Their sense of smell let them find and track foes.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>These monsters combined the savage hunger of trolls with the cunning and cruelty of demons.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>They were typically encountered alone, but often dwelt with bands or gangs of regular trolls. They invariably rose to dominate troll bands.</p>
