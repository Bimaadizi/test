<p>Andar Heartwood was the chieftain of the Black Lion tribe of the Moonlands in late-14 th century DR . It was under his leadership that the group of Uthgardt barbarians gave up on their nomadic lifestyle in The North , and settled for a life of lumbering, trapping and trading within the settlement of Beorunna's Well .</p>
<p>Although he was largely supported in this endeavour, there were still some within the Black Lions that felt they should not have abandoned the old-world life of nomadic migration. Among them was the more traditional-minded shaman, Patrevani Onehand . The Red Tiger tribe of the Cold Wood shared this sentiment, and the two clans had small clashes over the difference of lifestyle.</p>
<p>Chief Andar maintained a private hope that his tribe would be admitted to the Leage of Silver Marches .</p>
