<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before his coronation, the teenage Imbrar would travel under the alias of "Sarshel of Laviguer" . During this time his identity was kept hidden and his life protected by the Knights of Imphras II .</p>
<p>After reaching age 16, he was crowned on Marpenoth 24 , the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR . He took the throne from the aged Queen-Regent Sambryl , who herself gained power when Imbrar's uncle was killed just before his coronation. Much hope was placed in Imbrar by his subjects that he would reinvigorate Impilturan society. However, he died in 1385 DR , without an heir, the blood of the ill-fated Heltharn Dynasty spent.</p>
