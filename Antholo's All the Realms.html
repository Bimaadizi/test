<p>Antholo's All the Realms was a map and chart shop in Delzimmer , southeast Faerûn , owned by Antholo Kraul circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Antholo's was located on Riuntle Street in Delzimmer, a crossroads town (before the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR ) located between the Great Rift , the Eastern Shaar , Luiren , and the Forest of Amtar .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The shop was an unremarkable store front among many on Riuntle Street.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The maps and charts at Antholo's sold for 25 to 200 gold pieces . The more expensive ones were larger, newer, and/or in demand, but all were much more practical than decorative—showing the essential elements without much cluttering detail. Examples of his wares included copies of trade charts from Calimshan , Tharsult , and the Tashalar , which were themselves mostly copied from more authoritative originals kept in monasteries , royal libraries, and Candlekeep .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Antholo's All the Realms closed sometime in late 1371 or early 1372 DR when Antholo Kraul died while walking by a three-story residence that mysteriously collapsed upon him and a few others, fatally crushing them. Three of his female cousins closed the shop and were in a petty argument over the division of his wares when Kraul walked into his shop like nothing was amiss, a scant few days after his identified body had been burned on a funeral pyre. This same scenario was repeated many times over the next few months, which made Kraul somewhat notorious about town, and his shop benefited from that notoriety.</p>
