<p>Living webs , also known as duleeps , were a rare species of living, carnivorous webs.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Living webs resembled their namesake, being composed of grey filaments that mimicked cobwebs. Their body structure consisted of millions of microscopic identical cells, clustered together in colonies. They were mobile and capable of climbing almost any surface. When a living web moved, it looked like a flowing mass.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Living webs absorbed all electrical energy, both magical and mundane. It was immune to all fire, heat, cold, fear, repulsion and water-based effects and spells. They had significant resistance to blunt or dull weapons. While living webs lacked any sort of visible sensory organs, they were able to detect vibrations, heat and other living webs. A living webs grip on a surface was so strong, that it was impossible to separate it from a surface.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Living webs attacked a target by instinct. Any creature who came into physical contact with a living web received a nasty electrical shock. Living webs were capable of firing a lightning bolt at a target.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Since living webs were nomadic, they did not make any permanent lairs. They were always on the move, searching for their next meal. They ingested plants, carrion and anything they killed. Anything they digested was transformed into electrical energy. It also fed directly from electrical energy, which caused the living web to grow. When two living webs encountered each other, the stronger web always tried to absorb the weaker web.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Living webs were know to live within the midwood of Cormanthor and the woodlands between Mistledale and Shadowdale .</p>
<p>Outside of the Prime Material plane , some could be found in the Domains of Dread .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Living webs were known to act as servants of the Dark Seldarine goddess Lolth .</p>
<h3>Usages</h3>
<p>Living webs were sometimes used as guards or as a biological means of vermin control.</p>
<h2>Memory Web</h2>
<p>A memory web was a creature similar to a living web that fed on memories. A memory webs physical appearance was similar to the mass of webs from a web spells. It hid from a target by compressing itself into a small sphere. Once a target was close enough, it unwrapped and launched itself towards its prey. It was capable of jumping up to 180 ft (55 m) vertically and while in the air, it spread its body as wide as 20 ft (6.1 m) in diameter.</p>
<p>It wrapped itself around a target and began constricting them. The web that made up its body was not very strong, with a similar strength as regular cobwebs. Once its target is killed, it absorbed the memories into itself. If a memory web was killed, all the memories it absorbed released in a burst, and any creature within 200 ft (61 m) experienced these memories. Memory webs had a natural resistance to fire and magical weapons.</p>
