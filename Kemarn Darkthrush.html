<p>Kemarn Darkthrush was a wizard from Nesmé who attempted to kill Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun in 1374 DR .</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Raegar Stoneblade inadvertently exploded the side of Blackstaff Tower on 28 Uktar 1374 DR, causing Khelben to be wounded. Raegar tried to flee by shrouding the street in fog, and Kemarn took his opportunity to strike. He cast a spell to unleash four huge black wolves that began attacking Khelben.</p>
<p>A battle ensued between Kemarn and the defenders of the tower, who included Khelben, Elkord , Triam , Jalarra , Sarshel , Fhaornik , Maeralya and Pikar Salibuck .</p>
<p>After Khelben's apprentices were able to dispel the wolves, Kemarn used a red fist-sized globe to summon a nishruu , which began attacking Khelben and the other defenders. A sun elf apprentice, Fhaornik, attempted to use a rod of absorption to kill the nishruu, but it did not stop the creature.</p>
<p>Kemarn threatened Raegar with death unless he handed over his sword, but Raegar stabbed him in the shin and caused him to fall from a roof. Raegar then escaped with the sword.</p>
<p>The nishruu was eventually defeated when Tarik and Chaid al Farid al Fuqani using floating disks to dump salt onto the creature.</p>
