<p>The Gold Digger was an enchanted greatsword created by the Church of Waukeen sometime before 1368 DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Gold Digger possessed a +1 enchantment and dealt magical damage greater than that of similar weapons. Each successful hit, however, consumed ten gold coins from the wielder's pouch. When the sword's owner ran out of gold, the weapons acted as a simple mundane greatsword.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Gold Digger was forged and enchanted in Amn by dwarves who served the Church of Waukeen. In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , the Gold Digger fell into the hands of Lucky Aello , the merchant of Baldur's Gate who ran Lucky Aello's Discount Store located by the city gate leading to the Wyrm's Crossing .</p>
