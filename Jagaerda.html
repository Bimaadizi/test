<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1358 DR , Jagaerda went missing from her father's palace. It turned out that she had been kidnapped by pirates, who took her to a nearby hideout on the isle. However, the fighter managed to dispatch her kidnappers, and was then found by the Heroes of Ascore . She said that they could be her honor guard, and escorted her back to the palace. Jagaerda offered to join the party and accompanied them until they returned to the mainland. She helped the Heroes to secure the Statuette of the West on the Purple Rocks.</p>
<p>Later that year, many merchant ships heading to Gundarlun had been attacked by pirates, far more than normal. Against her father's wishes, she sailed to Mintarn to find out what was going on. Here, she learned of the joint plot of evil organizations to disguise themselves as soldiers from Waterdeep and cause commotion within the Lords' Alliance . She again asked to join the cause of the Heroes of Ascore and find hard evidence of the evil scheme, only parting with them once they left the isles.</p>
<p>Jagaerda later met with the heroes in Luskan , where she told them that Ruathym would apparently be backing Luskan in their scheme to blockade Waterdeep. She told them of Ruathym's Captain Redleg , who led the powerful armada. Jagaerda hinted that he was under magic control, as Ruathym would never ally with their ancient enemies. The princess then suggested that they head to Ruathym to find out what was going on, and when they accepted she lent them her ship, though she stayed behind in Luskan and was captured thereafter by Luskan guards.</p>
<p>The heroes whom liberated Redleg had ferried from Ruathym to Luskan, discovered and freed her. Jagaerda rejoined the heroes.</p>
