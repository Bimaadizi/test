<p>The Body Shop was a store belonging to the Datharathi chaka in Vaelan , Durpar . They grafted customers with plangent crystal prosthetics , turning them into plangents .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Body Shop was visible from far away even in the bustle of Vaelan, thanks to the statue atop it.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Atop the building a smoothly flowing, slender humanoid statue made of both gray stone and rose quartz reached for the sky. The statue was about 75 feet (23 meters) tall.</p>
<p>The lobby was longer than it was wide, made of flowing lines, with six displays: three on each lateral wall, advertising plangent configurations for sale: there was nothing else visible save for a white door.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>For those with the money, any plangent configuration could be provided.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Warian Datharathi , who left the city after 1367 DR , learned in 1374 DR that plangents had become common in Vaelan during his absence. It was popular knowledge that one could become a plangent at the Body Shop, suggesting that th Body Shop had been founded sometime after 1367 DR.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Per Eined Datharathi , those who took the crystal into their own bodies were no longer themselves.</p>
