<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In winter of 1375 DR , the Edgewarden was a lean figure, a tall, regal elf dressed in black robes emblazoned with the symbol of the Keepers of the Cerulean Sign . His eyes were milky white, with no iris; his shaved head made his ears look sinister rather than fey. He had a ramrod posture, and graceful, but worn features. He wore a platinum circlet.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Though he knew healing arts, he could not remove nilshai poison, only delay it. He also had the gift of divination, and was able to tell that Raidon Kane 's mother was Erunyauvë by sight. He could also reinscribe the borders of Sildëyuir .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He bore a platinum circlet and a robe.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As of 1375 DR , he had not seen anyone other than nilshai come his way for seven years. He wondered if he might be the last Keeper of the Cerulean Sign.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Kiril Duskmourn held great respect for the Edgewarden.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In winter of 1375 DR , he was approached by Kiril Duskmourn and Raidon Kane , who were carrying Adrik Commorand and looking for both healing and a path into Stardeep . Kiril also informed the Edgewarden that the nilshai invaders were agents of the aboleth , and that Raidon carried a Cerulean Sign . Looking at Raidon and his Sign, the Edgewarden divined that his mother's name was Erunyauvë , and assured the monk that he would share any information on her if the Traitor was stopped.</p>
