<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He had red hair and a red beard. He had a keen sense of smell, and disliked the stink of fey .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Einar and his partner, Eleuthra Davos , served King Derid Kendrick as spies within the ranks of the Black Blood tribe of lycanthropes . They used their shapechanging abilities to assume the form of beasts , allowing them to pass as fellow lycanthropes. Einar's preferred beast form was that of an enormous, reddish leopard .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 1470s DR, the Black Blood tribe began a ritual in the ruined city below Scourtop to revive Malar, who had been presumed dead since the early days of the Spellplague . Einar and Eleuthra teamed up with a golden elf known as the Savage (an ally of two sacrificial victims forced to participate in the ritual) to disrupt Malar's return. They launched a surprise attack, but failed to stop the ritual. Einar was quickly killed by the Malarite werewolves , who tore the flesh from his bones.</p>
