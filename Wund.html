<p>Wund was an mountain orc shaman from the tribes of the Sword Mountains in Northwest Faerûn . He was the founder of the Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge and creator of the orc realm of Uruth Ukrypt .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Wund prophesied that on the eve of the Feast of the Moon in the Year of the Red Rain, 927 DR , red clouds would appear over the mountains. On the date in question, this event actually occurred, and blood flowed down the mountains for three days, causing plagues to spread to the surrounding areas, and causing high casualties, in what was known as the Blood Plagues or the "White Hand of Yutrus." All of the tribal chieftains were wiped out, leaving a power vacuum for Wund to fill. It was after this event that Wund founded the Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge, a monastic order dedicated to spiritually uniting the orcs of the Sword Mountains. Wund crowned Uruth as king and the orcs began driving the trolls out of the mountains.</p>
<p>Under Wund's direction, the orcs of Uruth Ukrypt attacked the city of Waterdeep (then called Nimoar's Hold) in the Year of the Sky Riders, 936 DR , beginning the Orcfastings War . This war only ended after several defeats and the death of Wund himself, leading the orcs to retreat back to the Sword Mountains.</p>
