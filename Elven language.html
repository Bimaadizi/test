<p>Elven , commonly called Elvish and sometimes referred to as the True Tongue , was the language (or language family) of the Tel'Quessir ( e.g. , eladrin , elves , and drow ). Its script was known as Espruar .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Elven was one of the oldest languages and the parent of various other languages spoken by other races. It was known for being fluid in tone, rich, and varied in vocabulary, which made it exceptional for ballads, poems, and other artistic expressions. Well suited for magical theory and natural features, Elven offered a fine degree of differentiation to express concepts like emotions and philosophy as well as categorizing plants, animals, and weather patterns. However, Elven had limited vocabulary for technical topics such as industry, mechanics, or engineering.</p>
