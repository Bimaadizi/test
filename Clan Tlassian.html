<p>Clan Tlassian was a small clan in 1479 DR . The clan gained status in Thymari society when Tarhun became the Vanquisher , as the Tlassians offered to him their staunch military support. As a reward, Tarhun gave to them the lands to the east of Djerad Thymar , including the Tomb of Ur-Hammabi .</p>
<p>Aside from their role as defenders of the lands located to the east of Djerad Thymar, the Tlassians were known as one of the farming clans of Tymanther. They also specialized in metalwork, and were specially renowned for the quality of their armorcraft.</p>
