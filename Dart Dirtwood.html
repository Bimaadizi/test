<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Dart Dirtwood was a member of a gang assembled by Churg Elvek , secretly a cultist of the Absolute , who sought to strengthen its grasp of Baldur's Gate. When the famed writer Volothamp Geddarm returned to the Gate after misadventures in the Emerald Grove and coming face-to-face with the Absolute's army, Volo became a target for Churg and his gang. The master traveler was captured by Dart and the rest of the thugs and tied to a stack of smokepowder barrels, ready to be "brought to justice" for being an alleged agent of the Absolute at the hands of the gang and street gawkers. When a band known as the Absolute Adversaries interrupted the street execution, Dart Dirtwood, Churg Elvek, and the rest of the gang attacked the adventurers but were defeated.</p>
