<p>Diakka ( sing : diakk ), also sometimes known as diakkas ( sing : diakka ), were avian creatures native to all the layers of the plane known as Hades .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>There were two distinct groups of diakk, the varath and the carcene . Both varieties had human -like heads and and human-like arms in place of wings. These arms were rather small and clawed.</p>
<p>The varath were taller and stork-like, their vaguely human faces sported long bills, and their arms were thin. They also gave out loon-like cries, leading them to be dubbed "screechers" in the cant of Sigil . Meanwhile, the carcene were short and broad, resembling more of a squat pelican with a foreshortened bill. Unlike the varath, their cries were more in the vein of gobbling croaks and caws.</p>
<p>The color of the feathers on a diakk's body varied wildly, often featuring combinations of colors and in sickening hues. Typical colors included pea-green, rusty-red orange, purple, orange, pink, and dirty yellow. Their bills, claws, feet, and legs were typically either black, dark brown, maroon, or deep green in color. Their human-like heads were feathered, though their faces were featherless and brightly colored, being a color similar to their oily plumage.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Unlike the plane's most common inhabitants, the hordlings , diakka were far more organized and disliked erratic behavior. Though they still were not that bright, but Carcene were slightly more intelligent than varath.</p>
<p>All diakka were known to be very cowardly, devious, and sneaky. There was no mutual care or respect among them and a diakk would never put itself in jeopardy for another.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>These creatures had innate magical abilities that allowed them to cast the spells audible glamer once per day, jump twice per day, weakness once per day. If at least four of them encircled a group of enemies, they were capable of performing a magical dance of weakness that envoked a hypnotic area of effect similar to the spell ray of enfeeblement , that would effect creatures regardless of their magic resistance .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Diakka always attacked intelligently. The strongest member of any flock would assess opponents for both intent and weakness. Diakka would then attack only if they assessed a foe as being weaker than them. Powerful, hostile creatures would only be attacked if appeasement can not be reached.</p>
<p>When confronted with obviously strong opponents the diakka would work to surround their enemy, forcing them into a compact group, and use audible glamer to make them believe more diakka were on the way. The largest diakk would bound in and out of melee range of their opponents using the spell jump , while using the spell weakness to supplement their savage strikes.</p>
<p>Vartah preferred to stab at enemies with their long, sharp bills while the squat carcene preferred to tear at them with their clawed arms.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Much like birds, these creatures were organized in flocks that comprised both types of diakk. There were generally an equal number of each type, varath were sometimes more numerous. One or sometimes two diakka acted as the leader of a flock, a position that was often taken up by carcene.</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>The diakk was a carnivorous species, willing to eat the flesh of almost anything weaker than themselves.</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>In addition to speaking their own language, diakka spoke the language of many creatures found in the Lower planes .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Hordlings and other denizens of Hades were often known to feast upon these creatures. Hordlings considered them a staple in their diet.</p>
<p>Night hags were often known to summon these creatures to the Prime Material plane and use them as guards or servants, but eventually put them in their stew pots to be eaten. Those within Hades used them to guard their soul larvae . Their relationship with night hags was one of mutual hatred, though both believed it to be to their benefit.</p>
<p>A number of diakka served Baba Yaga and patrolled her magical dancing hut. It was thought by some that the species was originally created by this archfey , supposedly through the transformation of chickens she kept when she lived on a farm. These diakka saw Baba Yaga as their mother.</p>
<p>In addition, diakka were often seen acting as the servants of daemons throughout Hades.</p>
