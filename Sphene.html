<p>Sphene was a precious stone that came in many colors and, like scapra , was easily worked by unskilled cutters.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sphene was a soft, brittle gemstone that came in shades of yellow to deep green with a fine emerald green as the most prized hue. Sphene crystals could be cut into beautiful, sparkling, faceted gems of small to medium size. A typical specimen had a base value of 500 gp.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Wearers of this stone may not have known it, but they were much less likely to be hit by lightning or lightning-like spells or effects. And if they were struck, the damage not as bad as it might have been.</p>
