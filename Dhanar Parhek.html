<p>King Dhanar Parhek was the fourth and final Amnian monarch of the Parhek dynasty.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Dhanar was the only son of King Rhothar Parhek . His children were Dhanar the Younger , Rasa , and Malek .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The School of Wonder came to ruin in 1266 DR , as maddened students and demons destroyed it then spread across the countryside. This disaster prompted the young Dhanar to treat all wizardry as potentially treasonous in 1266 DR , leading to the arrest of many mages and the destruction of much of the Temple District of Athkatla in 1267 DR . The district held the homes of many mages as well as temples to Mystra and Azuth , as well as another mage school, and so they were put to the torch. The hot summer led to the fires spreading across northern Athkatla, the city fell into panic, and rival powerful families took to burning down each other's favorite temples as a means of indirect warfare. This led to the Temple District coming to lack any temples or shrines in times afterwards.</p>
<p>Dhanar attempted to quell the waves of violence and unrest with harsh punishments against the instigating wealthy classes, including the banishment of three powerful noble families from the city. Unfortunately, this heavy-handed response doomed him and his children. Only a few years into his reign, in the Year of the Crumbling Keep, 1276 DR he was assassinated by the agents of merchant powers that sought to remove the meddlesome monarch, and nobles set about finding a better heir to install on the throne. Although he had numerous descendants, the chaos that followed caused his family to scatter for safety as the realm fell into civil war with competing claimants, and no kings ruled Amn thereafter.</p>
