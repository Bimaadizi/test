<p>The Sea of Dust , as it was called by those who lived near it, was a vast and hazardous desert located somewhere in the continent of Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This desert was situated between territories controlled by powerful rival clans, who frequently sent out raiding parties against one another onto its steppes. Exactly hallway across its perilous expanse stood an oasis, which to many was considered necessary to reach if one wanted to cross its sandy steppes.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>Creatures known to inhabit the desert included giant scorpions .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point, a pair of samurai — Buntaro and Shoji , one from the Nakatomi clan and the other of the allied Soga clan —were detached from their army for a special mission. The pair were sent out to poison the desert's oasis, deriving a mixture from the berries and roots that grew around it, in order to stifle the raiding parties of the rival Lord Ichi . While traveling to the midway oasis, the pair was attacked by a giant scorpion and in the struggle their waterskin was torn, leaving them only a single bottle of water to subsist on. The two continued, nearly reaching the center, but suffering from dehydration the Soga samurai went mad and killed his ally so he could have the bottle all to himself. The Soga samurai eventually reached the oasis and made it out of the desert alive, but was unable to fulfill his mission as only his ally knew how to mix the needed poison . The Nakatomi samurai, having died a violent death before he could complete his mission, was left to linger on the Prime Material plane as a kuei .</p>
<p>Some years later, a group of adventurers trekking across the Sea of Dust stumbled upon the partially buried skeleton of the Nakatomi samurai. Clutched in his hands remained a piece of parchment , written in a script common to the region, detailing their mission from someone named Uji . Having disturbed either the skeleton or its parchment, one of the adventurers became possessed by the vengeful spirit .</p>
<p>As the adventurers continued their trek across the Sea of Dust, the possessed member of their party preyed upon their water supply at an abnormal rate, with the kuei driven to satisfy the unbearable thirst that was its last living memory. Once the party finally reached the oasis, the possessed victim began discreetly mixing the poison that the spirit had been tasked to do so long ago and dumped it into the watering hole. Almost immediately it became visibly apparent to the adventurers that the water was no longer safe to drink. And the kuei, with his special purpose in life finally fulfilled, was able to pass on to the Spirit World .</p>
