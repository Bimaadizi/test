<p>The Pholruth was a multi-function building owned by the nagra (local law enforcement) of Delzimmer in southeast Faerûn circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . It combined an inn, a barracks, a police station, a jail, a stable, and a bank called the Shrimmer.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Pholruth was located near the heart of Delzimmer.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Rising up three stories with wings radiating from a central structure, the Pholruth was an imposing stone edifice. There were three unconnected cellars used for different purposes.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>One wing of the ground floor contained the main nagra station house with its accompanying jail in the cellar below. Another wing on the first floor housed the combined bank, moneychanging service, and ethrael (property deeds) office known as the Shrimmer. Its cellar was used as vaults for deposits and the ethrael records for land, buildings, and large non-perishable items. Another wing was used as a stable for the nagra and for guests of the inn. The third cellar was used for storing goods seized from those who broke the kauladd (the local code of law).</p>
<p>The second floor of the Pholruth was given over to offices and sleeping quarters for the nagra and kala. The kala were the hired judges that supervised the Shrimmer and held court when needed.</p>
<p>The top floor served as an inn for outlanders doing business or passing through Delzimmer. It was quite clean and safe—being in the same building complex as the nagra station and possibly off-duty officers—but fairly expensive.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>See the main article for a description of how law enforcement worked and how the ethrael system functioned.</p>
<p>The inn cost three gold pieces per night and meals were not included. To stable a mount cost an extra five silver pieces per animal per night.</p>
