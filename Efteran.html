<p>Efteran was a Netherese arcanist who specialized in the creation of sleep-based spells .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The good -aligned mentalist was not at all robust or healthy, though she was said to be very peaceful.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Unlike other arcanists of the period, Efteran gained the respect of the elves of Netheril . She even travelled through the woods alongside them, particularly in the area of the Far Horns .</p>
<p>She was keen on recruiting new apprentices. However, she could not spend much time dedicated to their progress, and she was very physically feeble.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Efteran was born in 2053 NY (−1806 DR) . The frail arcanist invented two spells: sleep in 2087 NY (−1772 DR) , and dream in 2090 NY (−1769 DR) . During the Highsummer festival of 2093 NY (−1766 DR) in the enclave of Unity , Efteran died a natural death, and was unable to be resurrected . She passed away at the very young age of 40, making her one of the shortest-lived well-known Netherese arcanists, alongside Fahren .</p>
<p>Following her demise, her students tried to replicate her great work on sleep-magic and spell invention, but they failed in their efforts.</p>
