<h2>History</h2>
<p>When in early spring of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the Bloodshields came to Shadowdale , Thal was asked to lead them to Elminster, whom they sought. Thal led them to a cave where another doppelganger pretended to be Elminster, and a number of other doppelgangers had an ambush prepared; the Bloodshields did not survive.</p>
<p>A later attempt to ambush a number of War Wizards with the same trick failed, however, and Thal was held for questioning by War Wizard Lemmeth .</p>
