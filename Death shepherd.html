<p>Death shepherds were powerful undead creatures that led groups of the risen dead.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The shepherds were large armored skeletal figures that loomed over humanoids . Terrifying ornate armor decorated with skulls and bones motif shielded all parts of their bodies but the heads – white skulls that look at the opponents with sinister malice. Death shepherds wielded massive greatsword and were surrounded by a sickly green aura of necromantic magic .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Death shepherds were voiceless and silent; however, that did not stop them from creating undead and reanimating or reassembling slain unliving creatures to lead into battle via the spell -like ability called no rest for the wicked. The green magical radiance of 30 feet (9.1 meters) that emanated from these being affected all undead creatures within, including the death shepherds themselves. That undead ward aura gave them the boon of resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage. Lastly, the necrotic veil that surrounded death shepherds and their shambling servants made them resistant to all mundane and magical damage, except for radiant magic. Whilst around death shepherds, undead were immune to being turned .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a group of death shepherds was summoned into a battle with the githyanki who attacked and took over the Rosymorn Monastery , along the mountain path that led toward the monastery. Long after the enemies and the summoner were dead, death shepherds and their ghouls and ghasts wandered the road seeking mortal lives to sniff out. The same year, death shepherds could be found in the depths of the illithid colony of The Absolute underneath the Moonrise Towers , serving the cult's necromancer named Balthazar .</p>
