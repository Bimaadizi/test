<p>Malus Blackiron was a duergar specter priest of Deep Duerra and a member of Clan Blackiron at the small duergar settlement of Fort Iron in the Underdark under Mulmaster in the Moonsea .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Over time, most of Malus's fellow duergar went mad as a result of the influence of the Seed of Fel Earth , a sentient stone part of Ogrémoch . Malus's cleric powers protected him but, circa 1486 DR , the seed directed against him a purple worm and in the battle they slew each other. Malus however rose again as a specter.</p>
<p>He remained in the mine until 1491 DR , when an adventuring party hired by Leleanor to explore the mine found and defeated him.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>As a specter, Malus had a mental connection to the seed that tormented him. He felt as though he was a germ trapped inside a great restless beast and he felt all of its pain. He frequently rambled his lamentations and was prone to violent outbursts.</p>
