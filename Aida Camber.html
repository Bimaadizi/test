<p>Aida Camber was a carpenter in the town of Phandalin along with her sister, Cathlette Camber , in the late 15 th century DR.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR , Aida was kidnapped by psionic goblins and herded with several other victims and more goblins through an underground tunnel connected to a sinkhole beneath the Sleeping Giant . Aida, her sister, and her sister's fianc√©, Oskar Ninebough , were at the rear of the group because Oskar had an old leg injury that slowed him down. The other townspeople and goblins went ahead. They were then attacked by grells that killed several goblins. The grells grabbed the goblin corpses as well as Aida, Cathlette, and Oskar, and deposited them in a small cave along the passage.</p>
