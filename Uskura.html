<p>An uskura was a shapeless servant, given form through magic, created by the Deep Imaskari . It was bound to an object it could not stray far from and was used to take care of menial tasks.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The uskura referred to the servant itself, which was more of a force than a creature. They were shapeless and transparent, though they were most often bound to a physical object. Of those objects, amulets and ioun stones were preferred.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Uskuras had similar functions to an unseen servant , except that their weight limit was of 25 pounds (11 kilograms) and they could generate effects of greater strength, as well as move slightly more quickly. Most uskuras operated for up to a hundred minutes a day, though many Deep Imaskari artisans could devise uskuras of greater duration, and citizens could have more than one, to have round-the-clock service.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Uskuras were a Deep Imaskari invention and were in widespread use within Deep Imaskar , where most people possessed at least one.</p>
<p>In 1373 DR , Ususi Manaallin bound an uskura to her delver's orb , which she had personally fashioned. The uskura was destroyed during a confrontation with a supernatural darkness created by the Elder Evil Pandorym .</p>
