<p>Pea was a variety of edible legume grown on delicate vine plants with white flowers, harvested from elongated pods and used for food by humanoids and centaurs , among other creatures of the Realms . Several species of peas existed, including split , green and yellow .</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>In the Waterdhavian Bowels of the Earth tavern, peas were served stewed in a thick concoction of lentils , fat, bones, and meat scraps. This use was common across Faerûn ; in other places, these "everything in" stews were thickened with mashed yellow peas. Aurora's Emporium sold peas and green peas for 2 gp per pound. In the city of Baldur's Gate and the Chionthar Valley , roast beef joint dish was garnished with peas. Split pea soup, in the style of the Dalelands, was flavored with smoked ham and sprinkled with a generous amount of pepper , commonly served in the region's eateries.</p>
<p>In the Forest Kingdom of Cormyr , peas were cultivated in the town of Immersea . West of Cormyr, peas were grown in a small village of stone huts in the Veilstone Peaks – Bedford , where such crops as peas and potatoes could grow in rocky terrain.</p>
<p>In the Vilhon Reach , peas were grown in parts of the nation of Turmish .</p>
<p>In Calimshan and the Calim Empire , peas were among common dried ration foods, alongside figs , prunes , flat bread , dates , and goat cheese .</p>
<p>In the Vast , peas were a product of the Cottswald family, grown in the fields by the family's manor outside of Ravens Bluff . North of Ravens Bluff, one could purchase a hearty mean at the Hog Hill . Such meals included stewed pork , goat , or chicken with carrots , lentils, peas, parsnips , onions , and squashes .</p>

<p>In Zakhara , peas could be found stored in the granaries and kitchens of Sarahin in the Haunted Lands .</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The Savage Frontier , and the lands just south of Neverwinter served a staple pea soup , scooped into cut open bread loaves.</p>
<p>In the Dalelands and in Shadowdale , peas were commonly eaten with venison and potatoes – a strange combination for people of Turmish .</p>
<p>Peas were commonly dried for storage and to be consumed. Dried peas were also used by many thieves to scatter in front of pursuers like marbles or ball bearings. This practice went as far back as the ancient Athalantar . Dried peas in the north were exported out of Calimshan and Tashalar .</p>
<p>Trick locks – carved wooden balls used by gnomes and dwarves , hid hollow compartments filled with dried peas or metal chimes , allowing the items to rattle making them good toys for the children.</p>
<p>In magic, dried peas were used as a spell component to cast the fog cloud spell . Powdered dried peas, in turn, were used to cast the solid fog , death fog , and wall of fog spells. Priests of Lliira could conjure the triple mask spell with three peas as the material components.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Nether Mountain Scrolls, 1486 DR , three Chosen of Silvanus got together on Sapra with the leaders of the Turmishan druidic order known as the Emerald Enclave and conducted a magical ritual that ended a famine that had been plaguing that nation. This caused all manner of food to instantaneously grow throughout the land, including peas.</p>
