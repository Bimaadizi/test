<p>The Dragon's Neck Peninsula was the eastern part of the Tethyr Peninsula , with the Dragon's Head Peninsula being its western part.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Most of the peninsula was covered by the wild Forest of Tethir with the Firedrake Road crossing it on the southern bank. That stretch of the road was dangerous and sometimes hard to pass because of narrow trails, wild beasts, and bandits. The hamlet of Jhaansciim was the first notable settlement along the road in the Dragon's Neck Peninsula, several miles away from Khalid's Wall , a long ruined wall perpendicular to the shoreline.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Tethyr Peninsula was a landmass that protruded from the mainland of Tethyr in a shape that resembled a dragon with its maw wide open. The eastern part was called the Dragon's Neck Peninsula, aptly named for its shape being that of a dragon's neck. Tarseth Bay washed the northern side of the Dragon's Neck and the Firedrake Bay to the south. The Dragon's Neck Peninsula protected Firedrake Bay from fierce winter storms.</p>
