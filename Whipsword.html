<p>Whipswords were a variety of sword that lashed like whips . They required a great amount of training to be effective, but could be devastating in the hands of an expert.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>For the purpose of parrying, the first 8 inches (20 centimeters) of blade that emerged from a whipsword's hilt were as sturdy as that of other swords. From there, it transitioned into a thinner shape with a diamond-shaped cross-section, narrowing nearly to the width of a wire or ribbon for at least 2 feet (0.61 meters), after which it widened again into a "barb" that gave way to a more conventional swordpoint. In all, the blade and hilt typically measured 4​ to ​5 feet (1.2​ to ​1.5 meters) in length, with whipswords smithed for taller wielders reaching 6​ to ​7 feet (1.8​ to ​2.1 meters).</p>
<p>In order to achieve their whip-like lashing without breaking, whipsword blades were made of a special alloy.</p>
<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
<p>In an old-growth forest in southwestern Mistledale , a complement of elven guardians-turned- ghosts posted at a portal leading to the eastern Glimmerwood wielded long whipswords.</p>
