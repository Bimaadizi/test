<p>Broryn Windstag was a noble in Cormyr and a heir of the Windstag noble house during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Lord Windstag was blustering and bold. He was also a hothead.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Windstag was big and florid.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He was good with a blade, and even better at hunting.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Lord Traevyn Illance had been a friend and creditor of Broryn Windstag 's father; he was the one person Lord Windstag had trusted from youth. He was finally recruited into Illance's faction, which sought to have a Royal Magician from elsewhere mind-controlling the king for the benefit of the nobles.</p>
<p>Lord Windstag had a constant crony, the young Delasko Sornstern . Arclath Delcastle knew him to be associated with Marlin Stormserpent, Mellast Ormblade , Sacrast Handragon and Irlin Stonestable , as well as two other lords around Arclath's own age, Delasko Sornstern and Kathkote Dawntard.</p>
<p>Broryn Windstag was a heir of House Windstag .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Broryn Windstag was a guest at the Open Feast of Mirtul 26 in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR . He was present for the conversation between Kathkote Dawntard and Orstramagrus , which went well, to his disappointment.</p>
<p>Sornstern was with Broryn Windstag and Kathkote Dawntard when the three of them entered, drunk, to the Dragonriders Club , started a brawl, and attacked Delnor a palace messenger there, almost fighting Arclath Delcastle . They were later repelled by the arrival of the city watch of Suzail , and interrogated by the War Wizards .</p>
<p>After the meeting, they fled towards Marlin Stormserpent's residence at Stormserpent Towers , who involved them at that time in his intrigues involving blueflame items . When Marlin Stormserpent summoned his co-conspirators to tell them about an axe being a third such item, Windstag arrived with great haste together with Sacrast Handragon.</p>
<p>Later, the young lords Dawntard, Sornstern and Windstag carried out a frantic search for the axe; so energetic and haphazard their search was, that they themselves expressly did not understand the intensity of their own actions. Among other actions during their search, they'd offered large amounts of coin in a number of taverns frequented by the nobility, including the Rose and Dragon , the Servant Exalted , and the Hrelto . They were unknowingly controlled by the vampire archmage Manshoon , who had them target Lord Barandror Murandrake 's residence, where they finally found the axe. Though they were pursued by the War Wizard Glathra Barcantle and Swordcaptain Dralkin along the way, and nearly ran out of breath, a spell whisked them away, teleporting them nearly all the way to Stormserpent Towers. After delivering the axe to Marlin Stormserpent, his companions fainted; Windstag delivered the axe with little explanation.</p>
<p>However, the axe brought forth Mirt , one of the Lords of Waterdeep of the previous century, rather than one of the ghosts they sought after. Marlin and Windstag fought him, having decided they could at least seize as many of his properties as possible, even if he could not be commanded. He defeated them soundly, and injured Windstag greatly.</p>
<p>Broryn Windstag was not at the Council of the Dragon ; he heard of the calamitous consequences at Court later, at his home in Staghaven House , where he was hosting Irlin Stonestable . Mellast Ormblade and Sacrast Handragon arrived later, confirming what his servant, Aereld, first told him. While mooted there, they were subsequently joined by Traevyn Illance , Osbur , and Marlin Stormserpent; Traevyn recruited them into his faction. He was present when Traevyn Illance plotted a ruse for Marlin to get close to the king by pretending to save him from the blueflame ghosts: Lord Illance called on the Lords present to help him plot. After the moot, Lord Delasko Sornstern had a brief talk with Broryn Windstag about his father Haedro Sornstern 's learnings about blueflame items and the Imprisoners , back at the Sornstern Family Gardens . Unknown to them, they were being spied on by the highknight Sir Talonar Winter .</p>
<p>Broryn Windstag was found dead later at Staghaven House alongside all its inhabitants, his body cursed so that anyone who tried to pry information out of it was struck down with insanity.</p>
