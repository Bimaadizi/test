<p>The Risen Moon Market was a grocery in the city of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . It was known as the best place for produce in town.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It lay near the center of the city and stood opposite the High Lord's Hall .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>It sold fresh crops from farms in all seasons but winter. The store also grew mushrooms in the cellar. These were available at all times of the year and had a delicious, smokey taste.</p>
<p>Perhaps unusually, on each Shieldmeet , the Risen Moon Market was also traditionally where the ceremony for selecting the Green Regent —a Chosen of Mielikki —and the attendant Scions of the Green Regent was held. All who would volunteer for the role gathered here and the first part of the ritual was conducted by the druids of the Circle of the Stag .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was in business by 1366 DR and continued through 1370 DR .</p>
<p>In Shieldmeet of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , it was again the place where the next Green Regent was chosen.</p>
