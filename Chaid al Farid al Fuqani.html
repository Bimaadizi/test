<p>Chaid al Farid al Fuqani was a Tethyrian human mage who was an apprentice of Blackstaff Tower in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Chaid had dusky skin, jet-black curly hair, and bronze-colored eyes.</p>
<p>Being from the warmer climates of the south, he tended to dress in thicker clothing to stay warm.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Chaid's twin brother was Tarik al Farid al Fuqani . His teacher was Tsarra Chaadren .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Chaid's personality was in many ways the opposite of his twin's. He was quiet and thoughtful. One of his peers, the young elf Lynx called him ivaebhin "brightness-filled boy".</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He was originally from Myratma in Tethyr but had resided as an apprentice at the Blackstaff Tower in Waterdeep from a young age, having been sent there by his father along with his brother. In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , they were both ten years old.</p>
<p>On Uktar 28 , the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , he found his weasel familiar Brakar during a hunt in the Pellamcopse Woods under the supervision of Tsarra Chaadren. He named the little animal after the official coin used in Darromar , the capital of Tethyr, but only after asking the creature if it would like to be named. The fact that he had found a familiar made his twin brother jealous.</p>
<p>On the return trip to Waterdeep, they all passed a thief named Raegar Stoneblade , who had been secretly stalking them, but they were unaware of his significance at the time. Later that same day, Chaid and his brother used floating disks to dump salt on a nishruu that had attacked Blackstaff Tower and defeated it. They had become familiar with nishruu from hearing bedtime stories from Tsarra.</p>
