<p>A magecloak was a type of enchanted item, often jewelry, worn by wealthy Cormyrean nobles.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Magecloak rings , anklets, earrings, and even false beards were used to shield the wearer and those in the immediate vicinity from all forms of magical scrying .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Shortly before the Year of the Spur, 1348 DR , Jalassa Crownsilver of the old noble House Crownsilver , mother of Narantha Crownsilver of the Knights of Myth Drannor , acquired new magecloak earrings . She seemed unwilling to show the magic item to a fellow noble of Cormyr, Prester Yellander . Cormyrean nobles were convinced that even mighty Vangerdahast Aeiulvana , the Royal Magician, could not spy on them when magecloaks were active.</p>
<p>Magecloak items were exported from the neighboring nation of Sembia to Cormyr and valued at a small fortune.</p>
