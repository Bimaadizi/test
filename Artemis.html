<p>Artemis ( pronounced : /ˈ ɑːr t ɛ m ɪ s / AR-teh-miss ) was a multispheric interloper deity of hunting, young women, childbirth, wild beasts, and all manner of wild things. Some also associated her with the moon, but it only rarely counted among her portfolio. There was no evidence that this deity was directly worshiped in the Realms.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The avatars of Artemis typically appeared in the form of a slim, young woman or dryad in rustic clothing, closely resembling common depictions of Artemis. Her true form was quite large in stature.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The Huntress was wild at heart, favoring the untamed wilds of nature and holding disdain towards civilization and its various trappings. As was common amongst the Olympians, she was also arrogant, refusing to acknowledge a better in her chosen field. And much like her half-sister Athena , Artemis was sworn to eternal chastity. Over the years she rebuffed all attempts to woo her, preferring a life without a lover.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As a deity Artemis possessed a wide array of abilities. These included various divine immunities, being able to cast animal friendship fifteen times per day, cast command or rebuke plants fifteen times per day, cast greater turning fifteen times per day, plane shift at will, teleport without error at will, speak with animals or plants at will, and shape change or wild shape into any size of animal, including dire animals , and remain in that form for six days. She could also wild shape into an elemental , but only remain in that form for a period of three days. When transformed into an animal, her body was hasted as if by the spell of the same name. Some spoke of more fantastical abilities, claiming her avatar was impervious to harm from spells, or reflected them back at their caster, and having absolute power over all animals of the forest, with the exception of those that were magical beasts .</p>
<p>Uniquely, she was among the few Olympians immune to the lust-inducing powers of the Olympian Aphrodite .</p>
<p>The Huntress's senses of hearing, sight, smell, and touch extended out as far as 15 miles (24,000 meters). Like other deities she could perceive anything occurring within 15 mi (24,000 m) of objects and sites sacred to her, worshipers, and any location where her name or one of her many titles had been spoken within the prior hour. Being a goddess of the hunt and wild beasts, she could sense any act of hunting or any act affecting wild beasts, and could retain that sensation for fifteen weeks. She could divide her senses between up to ten places at a time.</p>
<p>The Huntress was capable of creating magical bows, arrows, quivers , and swords. As well as boots and cloaks of elvenkind , bracers of archery , rings of animal friendship , staves of the woodlands , and sylvan scimitars .</p>
<p>Artemis also had a wide variety of spell-like abilities that her avatar form could cast, deriving from the spheres of all , animal , divination , elemental , healing , plant , and weather . Some of these spells included the following:</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>As an expert archer, the avatars of Artemis wielded either an enchanted +3 bow and +2 arrows , that she could expertly fire as far as 1,000 yards (910 meters), or +5 arrows and a +5 composite longbow with the qualities mighty and speed . Other weapons included a poisoned slim +3 dagger and a +5 keen short sword .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Artemis spent much of her time hunting in Olympus, chasing down all manner of beast. She utilized loud hunting calls, earning her the moniker "noisy Artemis", but was otherwise quite stealthy. The Huntress would never engage in the activity for purposeless sport. She always hunted to feed herself or someone else, or to cull animals that were unbalancing their ecosystem by gaining a slight upper hand.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Artemis was born alongside her twin brother Apollo by the Greater Titan Leto and Zeus .</p>
<p>In a land that consisted of a collection of city-states , the same land that some early planar immigrants to Toril would later hail from, Artemis alongside her twin brother taught the man known as Chiron the arts of hunting and medicine, whose fame and skill in those fields became revered by deities and mortals alike over time.</p>
<p>At some point a group of adventurers on Toril came to the island of Achea and ascended it, bringing them into the plane of Olympus. The Olympian Hermes took notice of them and decided to have a bit of fun, disguising himself as a wizened shepherd and making up a backstory that Artemis sentenced him to forever wander Olympus after he mistended his flock.</p>
<p>At another point, an adventuring company from Toril called the Company of the Swan found themselves on Olympus after their wizard Wemick the Wise botched a casting of teleport without error . After traveling down mountainside for 4 miles (6,400 meters) they came across a cave, with an old hermit mage inside that called out to them using ventriloquism to enter. The hermit introduced himself as Jerraman, though much like what occured for the aforementioned group of adventurers, this was in actuality the Olympian god Hermes in disguise. After explaining to him how they got there, Jerraman offered the Company of the Swan a scroll of teleport without error if they could in return retrieve for him one of the arrows from the quiver of Artemis.</p>
<p>During their time in Olympus, trecking through the forest of Artemis, the adventurers never encountered the goddess herself. After rescuing a dryad from six minotaurs , they were informed by her that the forest they were in was so large that she hadn't seen Artemis in those parts for decades. Desperate for the scroll of teleport without error that was offered to them, the Company of the Swan sought out a medusa mage in the woods named Gharleee , who had two arrows of The Huntress in her possession. Eventually, whether by cooperating with or slaying the medusa, the Company of the Swan retrieved the arrows and earned the scroll that was promised them, allowing them to leave Olympus.</p>
<h2>Realm</h2>
<p>Like the rest of the Olympian pantheon, Artemis lived in the divine realm of Olympus on the Arvandor or "Olympus" layer of the plane of Arborea . She made her home in a small complex of caves on the side of Mount Olympus , but she considered the wider realm of Olympus to be her home, only ocassionally returning to the caves between her hunts. There was at least one huge forest in the realm that was particularly considered as belonging to her, inhabited by dryads, harpies , minotaurs, stirges , the elf village of Leiren, and a particularly large roc .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Artemis generally preferred the company of her hunting hounds, wild animals, dryads, and nymphs over the other Olympians. She and her twin brother Apollo were was close companions, being the closest thing to a friend each other had in the pantheon. If either was ever in need of aid, most of the time the other would spring to help them.</p>
<p>She was typically aloof with mortals. She was less than fond of centaurs and satrys , though called upon them just as much as dryads and nymphs to protect the woodlands.</p>
<p>Outside of the Olympians, Artemis was friends with Solonor Thelandira of the Seldarine and Uller of the Norse Pantheon , both of whom she frequently went on hunts with. Of the two, she most preferred the mutual silence and few words of Uller over the more gregarious Solonor. While Uller and her sometimes hunted in the tree-strewn hillsides of Olympus, other times the two stalked the wintry plains of Uller's realm in Vanaheim .</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Artemis was honored by rangers and hunters of either sex or gender , druids, some elves and halflings , and amazons on some worlds, such those of the city of Arkenos on Olympus. She was often revered alongside Apollo, sharing temples in many cities. Outside of these civic temples, Artemis had shrines located in sacred groves, glens, or alongside pure streams.</p>
<p>The clergy of her faith were exclusively female, either clerics or druids , and accepted both humans and non-humans alike into their ranks. Bows were her clergy's weapons of choice, as Artemis granted them supernatural aim, and wore deerskin clothing or moss green tunics for their priestly vestments. They had access to spells from the all, animal, divination, elemental, healing, plant, and weather spheres, as well as the animal , good , plant , and sun domains . They were also said to have absolute control over animals within a 1,000 yards (910 meters) area.</p>
<p>Celibacy and chastity were the highest requirements for the priestesses of Artemis. Some believed they had to go so far as to avoid men altogether. Any violation of the rules concerning chastity were grounds for Artemis revoking the priestess's standing in the church and her divine magic . They often retired from civilization to live in the forest, tending to the woodlands and their wild beasts. They spent much of their time around said animals and fey .</p>
<p>The teachings of her faith stressed importance of nature and its value. It called upon worshipers to protect the untamed land from destruction and reckless use. To that end, her followers were encouraged to never hunt for sport, but instead only to do so when they needing of food.</p>
<p>Sacrifices to Artemis traditionally took place under a full moon and in the form of deer. Her holy days fell on equinoxes.</p>
