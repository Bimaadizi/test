<p>The White Hart Inn was a hunting lodge inn located in the town of Noanar's Hold , long past its prime by the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The inn was a famous destination at some point in its life. It stood surrounded by humble stone huts and stabled of Noanar's Hold. The inn appeared to be neglected on the outside, but its interior was clean and well-cared for, and some could say quite posh for its rustic surroundings.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The White Hart hunting lodge was the first structure erected on the land that eventually became the hamlet of Noanar's Hold. The lodge was popular among wealthy merchants and nobles of the Sword Coast , rising to become one of the most beloved hunting spots in North Faerûn . Eventually, a settlement grew around the White Hart Inn.</p>
<p>Ghille Cever was the proprietress of the lodge circa 1372 DR .</p>
<p>Circa 1485 DR , the inn was ran by Avgar Filroy , a stout, polite, Chondathan man. He commanded a gang of permanently summoned unseen servants who cleaned the establishment. Many thought Avgar to be delusional as he warned his guests about hauntings around Noanar's Hold.</p>
