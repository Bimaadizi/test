<p>The Kincaid family were the traditional Ffolk royalty of the Kingdom of Snowdown in the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The family long ruled as kings and queens of Snowdown from their ancestral seat at Caer Westphal , and were well-liked by their Ffolk subjects.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Kincaids ruled Snowdown since at least the 5 th century DR . Like all royal families of the Moonshaes, the Kincaids traced their lineage to the Cymrych family of High Kings and Queens. However, following the decline of the Cymrych dynasty in the 10 th century DR, the kings and queens of Snowdown (like most other Ffolk noble families at the time) allowed the spelling and pronunciation of their name to change.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Saddle, 1345 DR , King Pwylloch of Snowdown was assassinated by Razfallow on the orders of Cyndre , thus ending his royal line. However, a Kincaid would once again sit on the throne by the turn of the 15 th century DR.</p>
<p>Their reign came to an end when their island was annexed by Amnian forces in the Year of the Sceptered One, 1404 DR , and the family would be held hostage and threatened with violence in order to enforce compliance among the populace. The Amnian viceroy, Erliza Daressin , would claim that the family had invited her to rule in their stead.</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, the Kincaids continued to be held prisoner within their ancestral castle .</p>
