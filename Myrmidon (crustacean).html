<p>Myrmidons were an unusual species of crustacean endemic to the Sea of Moving Ice .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>They were typically found within estuaries, shallows, and shoals. They were valued by the Reghedmen tribes.</p>
<p>Their bodies contained a potent acid that could be harvested by gutting them.</p>
<h3>Uses</h3>
<p>When diluted with distilled water, myrmidon acid could be used to remove rust. This mixture was sometimes used in the restoration of old relics in the North .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 15 th century DR an alchemist examining a myrmidon found that the acid contained within its body was in fact the same type of acid that could be found inside of ants . Following this discovery, myrmidons gave rise to a number of theories regarding what the biological relationship between crustaceans and insects truly was.</p>
