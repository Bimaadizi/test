<p>Rhun's Horned Cloak , which was also simply called a horned cloak , was an enchanted cloak that provided numerous benefits to its wearer.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This hooded cloak was dark brown. A pair of large horns protruded from the hood. Some of these cloaks came with a prehensile tail at the bottom that the wearer could control mentally and use as a weapon.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Anyone wearing this cloak could pass without trace at will. The cloak also acted like a cloak of protection , making it more difficult for enemies to strike the wearer.</p>
<p>The cloak allowed the wearer to shapechange into a strong bull up to six times per day. There was a slight chance with each passing minute that the cloak would vanish while the wearer was in bull form, trapping them that way.</p>
<p>Some variations of these cloaks had face masks that provided the gift of infravision to the wearer.</p>
