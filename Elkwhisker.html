<p>Elkwhisker was a mage of the Misbegotten Realms .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1989 CE, Elkwhisker visited Earth and spoke to occasional Dragon magazine contributor John M. Maxstadt about his world. Usually, anyway. Other times it was just random stuff like Halloween masks or pet rocks and things. Meanwhile, Maxstadt took notes, drank madeira, and nodded off. Fortunately, tape recorders still existed back then and caught some of their exchanges.</p>
<p>One time, Elkwhisker actually talked about the notorious Nimrod of Nump and his various spells and magical items . Elkwhisker revealed that he himself had discovered a trove of Nimrod's perilous cylindrical scrolls in the Kingdom of Slumdudgeon, whilst fishing in a dumpster behind the House of Out.</p>
<p>Maxstadt, meanwhile, would later offer insufficient apologies to Ed Greenwood for some reason.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Elkwhisker had a habit of smugly making irrelevant statements to get people's interest, before he bored them to tears and/or sleep. He mistook yawns for awe.</p>
