<p>Lalondra Worul reigned for decades as Shar 's high priestess.</p>
<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Lalondra was a young Sharran when she began receiving visions in her dreams from her goddess of the location of a sacred relic, Gorothir's Girdle . Circa 617 DR , Lalondra took the Girdle from its former owner, whom Shar had turned into a tortured undead thing. With the power and authority that the Girdle provided, Lalondra created the True Servants of Shar , whose members, all capable devotees of Shar, came to rule her clergy all along the Sword Coast for the next eighty years.</p>
<p>Lalondra had used powerful magic to bind the True Servants lives to her own and when she successfully pursued lichdom in 697 DR , that magic snuffed out their life forces, effectively leaving their followers leaderless. Riots ensued in twelve cities as the directionless minions of the church saw their power disappear in a short space of time. The authorities in those cities violently quelled the rioting but not before King Davyd of Delimbiyran was killed.</p>
<p>Selfishly, Lalondra ventured into the Underdark but Shar, furious with her formerly favored servant, stripped Lalondra of all of her power, which left her a much easier target when she was attacked by an alliance of drow from Eryndlyn and illithiliches , who absconded with the Girdle once Lalondra had been destroyed.</p>
