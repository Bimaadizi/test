<p>The City Guard of the Qudra was an impressive military organization that served as a police force within the city as well as a standing army for the "City of Power".</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The composition of the city guard as of 1367Â DR was 25,000 mamluk infantry, 6,000 mamluk cavalry, 400 special aerial troops, and 50 naval vessels.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>It should be noted that each and every mamluk of Qudra was a highly trained slave that was far more superior on the battlefield compared to a regular Zakharan soldier. Each and every mamluk technically belonged to the Grand Caliph in Huzuz , and were only allowed to serve other masters under the Grand Caliph's strict permission. Only half of Qudra's ships were in working order as of 1367 DR thanks to a recent failed assault on the corsair city of Hawa , as well as a general state of disrepair from neglect.</p>
<p>To provide magical aid, Qudra hired arcane and divine spellcasters when needed.</p>
