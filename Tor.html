<p>Iriaebor ( pronounced : / ɪər i ˈ eɪ b ɔːr / eer-ee-AY-bore ), also known as the Overland City and the City of a Thousand Spires , was a large city in Sunset Vale in the Western Heartlands region of west Faerûn . While it retained its status as an independent city-state, it remained within the realm of influence of the 15 th century nation of Elturgard .</p>
<p>While it was considered to be one of the most densely-populated and economically influential locales in western Faerûn , it was believed its true potential as a great power was stymied by the petty squabbles and in-fighting that plagued many of its residents.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Many of the narrow streets of Iriaebor were covered in shadows during all hours of the day due to the great many bridges and overhanging balconies that connected its many decrepit stone towers. The fact that these often-slanted spires were built too close to one another lent to a feeling of claustrophobia and confinement that pervaded the city. Because space was limited in Iriaebor, so many of the locals simply built upwards rather than outwards.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The city stood on a sprawling ridge known locally as the Tor , above the north fork of the river Chionthar , on the southern end of the Dusk Road .</p>
<p>Iriaebor enjoyed a competitive rivalry with nearby Scornubel , and an even stronger one with its neighboring city of Berdusk , the latter of which which was nicknamed the Jewel of the Vale much to the chagrin of the Iraebans. Despite their competition with one another, the two cities remained allies with one another.</p>
<p>The keep that housed the Kelemvorite Knights of the Eternal Order was located a short distance away from Iriaebor, and the Old Talking Ox inn was situated about an hour's ride north along the Dusk Road. The small town of Easting was named for the fact it was a short ways east of Iriaebor.</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>The vast plains that surrounded Iriaebor were ideal for the many animal-breeders and mount-tamers that chose to ply their craft in and around the city.</p>
<h2>Demonym</h2>
<p>A person from Iriaebor was known as an Iriaeben or Iriaeban.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>During the mid–14 th century DR, the city of Iriaebor was a member in good standing of the Lords' Alliance , the unified coalition of powers that combated the growing influence of the Zhentarim . It was then ruled by Bron , Lord Most High, Keeper of the High Tower, Watchwarden of the Flowing Chionthar, with the support and guidance of a forty-person merchant council. While he appointed and dismissed the members of the council, his decisions were very much guided by their greater consensus.</p>
<p>For a brief time in 1363 DR , the Zhentarim emerged victorious in their efforts against Iriaebor, managing to take control of the city and put in place their own puppet ruler, Lord Ravendas . During that time, Zhent control of the city was essential to their domination of trade throughout the southern Sword Coast .</p>
<p>At some time during or before the late 15 th century DR, Iriaebor was considered to be a "strong and independent city", and despite favors being thrown at it, Iriaebor was resisting being annexed into the neighboring nation of Elturgard .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Iriaebor carried the caravan trade on the Dusk Road over the rapids and rough water of the upper Chionthar river, and linked up with the Trader's Road . Its merchants traded with merchants from many towns and cities including Asbravn , Elturel , Baldur's Gate , and even as far east as Arabel in the kingdom of Cormyr .</p>
<p>Iriaeban horse -breeders had a reputation for the exceptional mounts that they produced.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>One of the periodical chapbooks of note in Iriaebor was Malanxer's Tongue . It published rants aimed at local corrupt politicians, merchants, and other individuals of note.</p>
<h2>Defense</h2>
<p>The Shield of Iriaebor was the name of the fighting force that protected the city. The well-armed military acted to both police the city and patrol the surrounding lands. Circa the mid–14 th century they numbered about 8,000 strong — 2,000 of whom were local warriors and newly-trained recruits, with the remainder comprised of hired sell-swords.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>One conflict that arose involving Iriaebor was a great army of orc and goblinoid forces that descended upon the city in the Year of the Shattered Altar, 1264 DR . During the battle, it was reported that the fervent Helmite servant Garshond received the legendary Helm of Helm , and wore it until the city's invaders were turned away.</p>
<p>In autumn of the Year of the Wyvern, 1363 DR , Lord Bron disappeared from within the city and the Zhentarim moved swiftly to supplant him with their own leader, Lord Ravendas.</p>
<p>Some four years later , the Spotted plague broke out throughout Iriaebor, killing a score of citizens before it was stopped by the combined clergies of the city's temples.</p>
<p>Just prior to the calamitous Second Sundering , in the Year of the Awakened Sleepers, 1484 DR , Iriaebor was hit by a memorable earthquake.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>The city was split into three sections: The Docks district was situated on the area south at the base of the tor, along the northern shore of the River Chionthar; the Old City, which housed many of the city's most important landmarks was built on the Tor itself; while the Lower City comprised the flatlands north of the Tor, set within the northern city walls.</p>
<p>The city also housed shrines dedicated to Auril , Lathander , Talos , Tempus , and Tymora</p>
<p>Iriaebor was one of the cities that was known to house an enclave of Thayan wizards.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Iriaebor had a long history of intrigue and conflict that emerged amongst the various mercantile groups, influential Iriaeban families and greater factions that took hold within its walls. Noted mercantile groups active in the city included the Dragoneye and Thousandheads trading costers, the far-reaching Knights of the Shield , the Six Coffers Market Priakos , and the powerful Men of the Basilisk .</p>
<p>A number of dastardly groups made their headquarters in Iriaebor, including the Black Band , the Broken Dagger , the Flamefingers , the Blacktalons Mercenary Company , as well as Night Skulls thieves' guild, and later the Purple Masks Guild . While the city received influence from the Zhentarim for some time, it was wholly taken over by the organization for a brief while in the 1360s DR.</p>
<p>Adventurers were seen as trouble in Iriaebor, and there were only two known establishments in the city that catered to their wants and needs.</p>
