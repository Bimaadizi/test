<p>Oraphelia Mayne , nicknamed Burkins after an old family name, was a tiefling merchant who operated along the Sword Coast in the late 15th century.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Oraphelia was a red-skinned tiefling with long black hair and prominent red horns. She often wore ornate gold-embellished robes.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She had a sarcastic personality, and was not at all concerned about the morality of supplying pirates and criminals.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Oraphelia originally operated in Neverwinter , but moved her business to Luskan sometime around 1487 DR , citing excessive competition in Neverwinter. She encountered the Champion of the Burning Dawn on her journey from Neverwinter to Luskan, and requested their aid in delivering a package that, unbeknownst to them, contained poison.</p>
<p>She was later warned by the Champion that a mysterious figure in the sewers had told them to let her know that her business was now being watched. She assumed the mysterious figure to be of Bregan D'aerthe .</p>
