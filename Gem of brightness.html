<p>A gem of brightness was a magical gem that was enchanted with an assortment of light-emanating powers.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Typical gems of brightness were shaped like long and rough prisms.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Three settings were available when activating a gem of brightness , each requiring a different command word. The first command caused the gem to shed light that was bright enough to read by out to a range of 60 feet (18 meters), similarly to a hooded lantern . The second command fired a burst of light directed at a creature within a range of 60 feet (18 meters), potentially blinding the creature temporarily. The third command produced a flare that extended in a cone out to a range of 30 feet (9.1 meters), potentially blinding everyone caught in that area.</p>
<p>The first power could be used at will and was never expended, as long as the gem still contained some of its magic. The second and third commands drained the gem of its magic and could only be used a limited number of times. Once the gem of brightness was completely drained, it became an ordinary gem worth 50 gp .</p>
