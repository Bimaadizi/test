<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Maldur Breakstone was a wizard. Among his many spells were one that created a striking fist made of force, one that invoked storm forces to strike with lightning and roaring thunder both, one that sent forth deadly shafts of shadow that caused terror in those whom they struck, and one that radiated bolts of light from him to a great distance away. Another of his spells made his palms sprout fanged mouths. Finally, one of his spells created a scarlet radiance that broke other magics, though it was not clear whether he used all that magic under his own power or if it came from his possessions. He could also cause blinding flashes or explosions, one of which or both came from a wand .</p>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He served King Orchtrien , and was a rival to fellow wizard and royal deputy Rhespen Ash .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Maldur Breakstone had been a rival of Rhespen Ash for years. Maldur pushed King Orchtrien to rule in ways favorable to humans, in direct opposition to Rhespen's preferred policies.</p>
<p>After the rebellion of the three elven clans, Starfall , Vilirith , and Duskmere in −25,090 DR , which Prince Bexendral put down, Maldur counseled King Orchtrien that the entire clans be put to the sword right away; the King instead took the advice of his rival, Rhespen Ash, to be more merciful. The heirs of the clans were taken to Dawnfire, where they would be educated, and serve as hostages at the same time.</p>
<p>During a dinner revel celebrating Orchtrien's victory over the red triumvirate , the King asked one of the hostages, Lady Winterflower Duskmere , to sing for him. She sang a ballad about a mad king bringing forth ruin, which Maldur took as an opportunity to chastise her, using a spell to strike her with a fist made of force. He accused her of maligning the king with her song; Rhespen Ash, his rival, defended the Lady. King Orchtrien bid them duel, for he considered their rivalry had gone on long enough. Maldur was defeated in that duel. By the King's command, Maldur made an attempt to work harmoniously with Rhespen since.</p>
<p>Later the same year, after Rhespen Ash returned from winter incursions against the neighboring lands of the green cabal , his forces were met on the path to Dawnfire by Maldur Breakstone, who brought them fresh horses and garments in advance of the celebration in Rhespen's honor. This made Rhespen quite suspicious, owing to Maldur's rank and the trivialness of the task. Maldur also informed Rhespen that the King had taken Winterflower Duskmere as his lover, to forestall any awkwardness. He took pleasure in breaking the bad news to his rival, who had fallen for her.</p>
<p>After the party, Maldur noticed Rhespen was missing much of the time, and tired throughout the day. He spent the next few months anticipating that Rhespen would try to meet in secret with Winterflower. He eventually succeeded in catching him visiting the Lady, only to discover that the elven wizard had transcribed the King's books of magic. With the aid of several half-dragon crossbowmen, Maldur managed to subdue Rhespen, but Winterflower stole the elf's staff, the copied spellbooks, and escaped.</p>
<p>Maldur later took part in the search for the King's spellbooks. He commanded some of the forces that attacked the Duskmere family stronghold.</p>
