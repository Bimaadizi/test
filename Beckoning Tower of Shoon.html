<p>The Beckoning Tower of Shoon , which was previously called the Beacon Tower of Shoon , was a lighthouse constructed on the largest rock within the Beacon Rocks formation on the Great Sea southwest of Samarach .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Beckoning Tower of Shoon stood 40 feet (12 meters) tall with a diameter of 25 feet (7.6 meters). A wooden door was found along the base which led to a stairway along the outer wall that provided access to all three levels of the tower. A continual flame effect adorned the top of the tower and was visible for miles in every direction.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The lighthouse was constructed during the reign of Shoon IV . Some time after the fall of the Shoon Imperium , an unknown wizard placed an enchantment upon the tower. The enchantment behaved like a sympathy spell , luring any humans toward the tower like moths to a flame. Once a beacon of safety, the Beckoning Tower of Shoon later was a dangerous trap that caused many sailors to dash their ships against the rocks.</p>
