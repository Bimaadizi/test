<p>Maid of the Moors was a warm and welcoming restaurant in Mornbryn's Shield in the Savage Frontier in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR run by Beldora Thiiruin . It served a limited but hearty menu including the local specialty, bustards . Maid of the Moors was the only restaurant found in the Shield circa 1365 DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The building itself had huge windows, filling the restaurant with daylight. In case of storms or very common troll attacks on the hamlet, the restaurant covered the windows with fitted shutters.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The interior was welcoming, well-lit, with ferns and other types of plants hanging around the dining room.</p>
<p>Beldora kept pet bats and allowed them to fly around the restaurant, supposedly to hunt insects.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The Maid was a happy and uplifting spot amidst the dampness and dangers of the Evermoors where the hamlet of Mornbryn's Shield was located.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Maid carried food and non-alcoholic drinks. Beldora herself simply did not have enough time nor hands to serve alcohol or more complex mixed concoctions , nor was she that interested in them, and simply recommended guests to stop at the Troll in Flames Inn for a pint. Instead, Maid of the Moors served tea , fruit juices , and warm hearty broths .</p>
<p>The meals of note served at the Maid included a few dishes. One was a fresh salad of local lettuce , olives , parsley , parsnips , cheese , and whitecurds (cottage cheese). Another was the fryplate , with all the fried favourites like tomatoes , bacon , mushrooms , all covered in sliced almonds , generously buttered scrambled eggs with pepper and a splash of brandy . Finally there was bustards , the locally hunted ground quail of the Evermoors, cooked smothered in clay inside the flaming oven , then in a covered pot , and served with quail eggs , vegetables and beef tallow . Beldora served bustards (two birds per order) on a large plate of abundant roasted vegetables and cabbage .</p>
