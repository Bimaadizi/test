<p>The Spirit of the Neverwinter Woods was a fey defender of Neverwinter Wood in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime shortly before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the fey inhabitants of Neverwinter Wood faced a crisis that left the Spirit of the Neverwinter Woods wounded. In attempts to defend the forest, a group of dryads and nymphs crafted a powerful weapon â€“ a fey spear , to be given to a hero willing to defend them and the Spirit. Before the fey spear found a hero, the crisis was over, and the weapon was discarded and forgotten.</p>
