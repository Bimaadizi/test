<p>In 1377 DR , Glizn was the quasit that Piri , an apprentice in the College of Mages and acolyte of the skin , bonded to himself using an ancient Ritual of Bonding rediscovered by Q'arlynd Melarn .</p>
<p>In 1379 DR , Glizn managed to gain control of Piri and instigated him into a duel with his fellow Eldrinn Elpragh . Glizn's plot was to kill Eldrinn and remove a possible rival for Piri. Q'arlynd cast a spell to send Glizn back to the Abyss but Piri's body also disappeared.</p>
