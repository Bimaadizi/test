Their mouths were filled with misshapen browned teeth, appendages ended in blood red claws, and eyes glowed with malicious radiance.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , a number of forest hags lurked in the King's Forest south of the village of Eveningstar in Cormyr. One notable elder forest hag, Grundlehin , and her coven including the night hag Frelga , laired in a deep dark cavern underneath a ravaged farmhouse outside of Eveningstar. Her coven was confronted by a band of adventurers from Eberron after the War Wizard Barthand disappeared into the cavern.</p>
