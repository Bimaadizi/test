<p>Raudor was an ancient Imaskari city in the Hordelands .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Built during the Imaskari Empire , Raudor was a city nestled beneath a cliff of the Raurin Alta , in what was once a green vale. However, due to rock slides off the cliffs, and the expansion of the Plains of Purple Dust , the city became buried under sand and rock.</p>
<p>While the buildings of Raudor were preserved by the sand, few visited the city due to the lack of treasure, and the city's ability to drive people insane. The few who did visit the city were mostly evil wizards , drawn by a desire to try to find the source of the city's evil, or the ancient evil artifacts that were said to be there, in attempts to increase their own power. On 1372 DR , there was a stench of death and decay filling the air for miles around the ruins.</p>
<p>Most who visited the city died, many came back insane, and others still returned more crazy and powerful then they were before, serving as inspiration to others who sought power to come to the city. As of 1372 DR , there was a solitary mind flayer elder brain that had gone mad from centuries of isolation, still attended by three brain golems . Over the next hundred years, it would begin to radiate an overpowering malevolence, urging anyone it could contact to perform atrocities upon their companions, as well as giving them an intense desire to eat living brains.</p>
<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>In 1372 DR , there were few tales about the ruins, speaking of an overpowering evil presence that ruled the vermin around it. Deep Imaskari records suggested that the Fourth Imaskarcana had been there at the time of the city's fall. Over a hundred years later, in 1497 DR , that had become a rumor outside of Deep Imaskar.</p>
