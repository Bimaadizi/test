<p>Woodspiders were a variety of spiders mutated through magic by the Church of Lolth long before the mid-14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Like their mundane kin, woodspiders possessed a venomous bite. As they were creatures of living wood, they were resistant to all bludgeoning damage but were slightly more vulnerable to flames and lightning. They were also unaffected by charm and illusion magics.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Woodspiders dwelled in underground areas in lairs, thickly draped in odd spiderwebs. Their webs were brown in color and mushy yet brittle like dry twigs. The webs were highly flammable.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Woodspiders were a creation of the priests of Lolth within the Temple of Lolth near the trail that led to the town of Mossbridges in the Vast , dating back many years before the late 14 th century DR. The priests were altering the sticks to snakes spell to find way to create giant spiders from simple sticks. Still, the research was not as successful as they hoped. The living creatures of the wood, woodspiders, murdered all the researchers but eventually were subdued, and priests attempted to domesticate them. For one reason or another, woodspiders were left behind when the Temple of Lolth was abandoned.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , a group of heroes of the Living City was tasked with finding and exploring the ruined temple, where they came across these strange wooden arachnids who guarded a collection of rare books that included the Cookbooks of the Underdark and a spellbook of the drow mage named Rouarthek .</p>
