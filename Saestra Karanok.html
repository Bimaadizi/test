<p>Saestra Karanok was the vampire daughter of the ruler of Luthcheq in Chessenta in 1357 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During a very cruel joke by her brother, Naeros Karanok , she was locked in a crypt for nine days. When Saestra exited she was a vampire. However, she managed to keep this fact secret from her family and directed them in destroying her vampire master.</p>
<p>Saestra managed to keep her secret by supervising the city watch at night, explaining this as a system to improve the watch's efficiency. Using the watch's cover, she killed people she framed as wizards, secretly draining them of blood.</p>
<p>Eventually, Saestra's true nature was discovered by her father and she escaped from Luthcheq. After some travel, she relocated to Erlkazar , where she became the hidden queen of that kingdom. First Saestra united all the bandits in the area in a efficient army and later she seduced and transformed the country's king.</p>
<p>In 1600 DR , Saestra was still in operation when she and Sanwar Beguine attacked Jadaren Hold near Erlkazar .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>In the day, Saestra delivered baskets of food, healing herbs , and small toys for the children of Luthcheq. At night, Saestra used confiscated magic tools to incriminate a person as a wizard and during a private interrogation drained the victim's blood.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Saestra had two personalities depending on her hunger: in one she was sweet, innocent, and loving; in the other she was a savage killer.</p>
