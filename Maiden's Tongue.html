<h2>Speakers</h2>
<p>The Maiden's Tongue was used exclusively by the Dambrathan priestesses of Loviatar in their rites. Each priestess was taught the language, which was believed to be sacred to the Maiden of Pain, as part of her education.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The maidens' tongue resembled a degenerate form of the Thorass language . It was a language in the Central Thorass subgrouping, being related to Thorass . However, the tongue was unique enough that someone fluent in other Central Thorass languages still could not understand Maiden's Tongue.</p>
