<p>A lich lord was any lich that deviated from the standard form because of modifications it had made under its own power. Among the Zhentarim beholders , the term referred specifically to the form adopted by Iliph Thraun on achieving lichdom.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>For the specific case of Iliph Thraun , the lich lord resembled a hovering skull with white pinpoints of light in its eye sockets.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Iliph Thraun was unique in its need for specially modified spells to sustain itself, and its ability to wield spellfire .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>One particular lich lord, Iliph Thraun, had risen ca. 350 DR , a thousand years prior to 1357Â DR . The lich achieved its lichdom through a flawed process, and thus required spells to survive. It joined the search for Shandril Shessair in that year, after being brought before Manshoon by Zulthondre , who recommended the lich lord and furnished the means of controlling it. The beholder Xarlraun also had a bauble to control the lich lord.</p>
