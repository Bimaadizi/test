<p>Following her retirement from adventuring, Rachel still kept in contact with her teammate Travis Deepdell .

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Rachel Wykos was born in the city of Neverwinter in 1343 DR . Four years later she moved to the city of Waterdeep with her parents. Growing up she was full of energy and joy, but had a single-mindedness that often got her in trouble with the city guards. She began to show promise in the art of dance at a young age.</p>
<p>At the age of seventeen Rachel met a beautiful, female spectral dancer in a North Ward alley who kissed her and then proceeded to give her a bronze pendant stamped with the symbol of Lliira. She considered this a sign from the goddess herself and from that day onward dedicated herself to the Joybringer's service. Soon afterwards, she left Waterdeep with a love-struck boy named Rett and the adventuring company Knights of the Sword Coast . One day her adventuring company faced off against an ancient lich named Berthist in the Trollbark Forest . They managed to destroy him, but in the process their leader Barkess Lanys , Rett, and three other members died.</p>
<p>Following their deaths Rachel continued to adventure with the Knights of the Sword Coast, over time becoming an invaluable member. While adventuring she met and fell in love with a new member of the group, Arkiem Allen . When their group retired in Eleint of 1366 DR , she returned to Waterdeep with Arkiem and married him. With the money they saved up from adventuring to rent rooms in the Temple of Good Cheer in South Ward . From that day onward they worked towards saving up their money so they could purchase the entire decrepit temple from its owner and repair it into a proper temple.</p>
<p>In 1368 DR , she took a young woman named Lahren under her wing, teaching her Liira's blessings of self-worth and happiness. One day during prayer she was surprised when the young girl unwittingly cast light , who then took it as a sign that she should go adventuring. Encouraging the girl's zest for adventure, Rachel gifted her a rope of entanglement and a set of bracers of defense .</p>
