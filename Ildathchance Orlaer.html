<p>Ildathchance Orlaer was the Magister from 949 DR to 952 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Ildathchance was sophisticated and surly.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The mantle of the Magister that Ildathchance bore did not protect him from magic missile .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ildathchance joined the conspiracy against the previous Magister not with plans of destroying him, but only to elude a Magister who planned on killing all his co-conspirators; he created a clone of himself to run his holdings, and then sped off to the slaying. Though he hadn't planned on it, he became Magister, and then returned home to slay his clone.</p>
<p>The experience, however, shook him so much, that he fled his estate. He spent some time in the wilderness, praying to Mystra for guidance; it wasn't until he found a lost child from Shadowdale and employed magic to restore him to both health and home that Mystra replied. She beckoned him to a knoll deep in the forest; there, after their conversation, he swore to serve her dilligently even if it hastened his own destruction. As the Magister, he finally gave magic to over twenty apprentices, and visited some of the Schooled to further their mastery of magic.</p>
<p>Ildathchance was finally slain in an ambush by Baerzlus Anagathiir , who found one of the mage's caches, an abandoned dwarven mine somewhere in the North , and laid down numerous shields, each bearing a spell akin to magic missile , linked them together, and covered them with an illusion. Though Ildathchance bore a brooch of shielding , it was overwhelmed by the volume of missiles, and before he could cast a protective spell, he was crushed by a boulder that Baerzlus dropped from the mouth of the hideout.</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>The forest knoll where Ildathchance conferred with Mystra was consecrated to her ever since; Dammasae was buried there centuries later.</p>
