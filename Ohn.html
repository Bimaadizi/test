<h2>History</h2>
<p>When soldiers of Shou Lung invaded Tabot in Shou Year 646 (−604 DR) , the priests and the barbarians of the land were forced to ally against them. Baron Ohn of Han Chao led his warriors and joined with the great sohei Ramara and the monks and together they repelled the Shou in the Battle of Tsagang .</p>

It legitimized the monks' hermitages (now mountain keeps) and gave them a role in the defense of the lowland tribes and thereby cemented land and peace. They also founded the city of Tsagang at the site and founded the new nation of Tabot. All present blessed the union and it came to be a holy place and a holy word.</p>
