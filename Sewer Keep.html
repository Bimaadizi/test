<p>The Sewer Keep was a tower complex located in the Seatower district of Baldur's Gate . While it was originally used to deal with the city's massive waste and sewage problem, by the late 15 th century DR it had become a haven for a specialized band of thieves.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The civic facility was used to treat and purify the solid waste that left the city's sewer system and emptied out into the River Chionthar . This was accomplished by several holding tanks, combined with flora that were magically altered to cleanse the sewage. Solids settled at the bottom of these holding tanks, where they eventually (after being treated & purified) were rodded or pumped out of the tanks and then carted away upriver to be spread upon agricultural fields as fertilizer.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sewer Keep was part of a widescale update to the sewage system of Baldur's Gate that the Church of Gond had devised some years prior to 1368 DR in order to confront the serious health issues that were arising from flaws in the then-current system. Its ultimate founding was a significant feat, accomplished by a partnership of druids , civic engineers and wealthy Baldurian patriar .</p>
<p>By the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the facility had largely been taken over by Genamine Kopali and the Sewerkeepers crew.</p>
