<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1340 DR , the city was laid in ruins and Podol Plaza was still used as a trading post for orcs , hobgoblins , kobolds , trolls , and goblins , that reigned over the Old Phlan. In 1340 DR, the goblinoids of the ruined Phlan held a big auction to sell a powerful magical item they looted from one of the secret locations of the city. The auction attracted the attention of "the Boss", the possessing spirit Tyranthraxus himself. The evil master of the ruins did not attend the auction however. Instead, he sent his wizard lackey Garwin the Mage and his bodyguard, the ogre Buldwar .</p>
<p>In 1367 DR , the city of Phlan went through an economic boom after the hardships the city suffered from the slew of threats like wars, the coming of Tyranthraxus, and the seizure by Bane . The areas of the city destroyed and damaged by those threats were being rebuilt to serve the citizens and guests of Phlan once again.</p>
