<p>A masthead of durability was a type of enchanted mast step that vastly improved the durability of any mast that was installed into it. They were primarily used in Realmspace among spelljammers .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These small silver items were structural supports installed at the base of masts, physically bolting them to their decks.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Any mast that was equipped with a masthead of durability would be vastly strengthened, becoming virtually indestructible to physical attacks. Additionally, if a spelljammer were to ever attempt shearing off the top of a mast, the ship would suffer damage equivalent to its tonnage. However, they could not protect masts against destruction by fire.</p>
