<p>Bolts of power were the collective term to describe a collection of different magical darts .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The bolts of power were identical in their look despite having different powers. They could be either thrown like a dart or launched from a hand crossbow .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Bolts of power could pass without problem through a globe of invulnerability but were useless inside an anti-magic shell . However, in the latter case, their magic was not expended. Therefore, if one managed to retrieve the bolt, then one could re-use it.</p>
<p>If the user was a drow, he or she could use it without problems. If the user was not a drow, then he or he could use it as long as he or she was not a cleric .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The bolts of power were magic items associated with the drow.</p>
