<p>Shago ( pronounced : /ˈ ʃ ɔː g oʊ / SHAW-go ) was a Chultan man working as a guide out of Fort Beluarian , Chult in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was quite large, standing at 6 ft 3 in (1.9 m) and 220 lb (100 kg). He had rippling muscles and a winning smile.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Shago was boastful, describing himself as having "the heart of a tyrannosaurus " and to be unafraid of hard work or danger. He claimed to be proficient in fighting, foraging, canoeing , camping, and whatever else a client might need from a guide.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Shago often worked as a jungle guide for Flaming Fist excursions seeking to clear undead from the Chultan jungles despite an intense personal fear about being turned into a zombie or ghoul . However, he believed that the Flaming Fist represented Chult's best hope for being rid of the undead that plagued them.</p>
<p>When hired by other parties, he presented himself as a true independent guide despite his sympathies lying with the Flaming Fist. He was not affiliated with the guides working out of Port Nyanzaru for the merchant prince Jobal , although he charged the same fee as most of them (five gold pieces per day with a one-month advance).</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He sought to make an impression with the Flaming Fist's Commander Liara Portyr , and hoped to gain admittance into the military organization.</p>
<p>Shago's mother was the noble merchant prince Zhanthi of Port Nyanzaru, who recruited him to act as a spy to relay information he gleaned from Fort Beluarian. However Shago remained devoted to the Flaming Fist, and only offered middling information to her. In truth, he was only one of her spies within the organization.</p>
<p>Shago's death was sought by his mother's rival, the merchant prince Kwayothé , who considered hiring adventurers to kill him.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, Shago claimed to have been to such places within the Chultan jungle as Kir Sabal , Firefinger , and the Peaks of Flame .</p>
