<p>Blue Bess was a female miniature behir used for breeding at the Behir's Nest shop in Khaerbaal circa 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Blue Bess was considered a good breeding stock. In the spring of that year, she produced a new brood of three from mating with another miniature behir named Ethan , under the watchful eye of artificer Justin , the proprietor of the Behir's Nest. Blue Bess's spawn were kept in a series of shallow pools within the shop where the young creatures were groomed, fed with chopped-up fish and eels , and allowed to lounge on sunning rocks until purchased. All three of Blue Bess's brood had only six legs, owing to their young age, and topaz -blue scales, which was a color popular among the mages of Khaerbaal.</p>
<p>The hero of the Battle of Akhlaur's Swamp , Tzigone , briefly worked at Behir's Nest, taking care of Blue Bess's brood in the spring of 1370 DR.</p>
