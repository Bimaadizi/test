<p>Cryonax ( pronounced : /ˈ k r aɪ oʊ n ɑː k s / KRY-o-naks listen ) was the Prince of evil cold-using creatures, and one of the inhabitants of the Para-Elemental Plane of Ice .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He somewhat resembled a yeti with two tentacles in place of each arm. He stood 15 feet (4.6 meters) tall and weighed 2,800 pounds (1,300 kilograms). He radiated an aura of terrible cold, said to chill both the body and soul of those around him.</p>
<h2>Domain</h2>
<p>Within his plane Cryonax resided in the Chiseled Estate , a massive ornate fortress constructed of ice, rock crystal, and glass that rose 1 mile (1,600 meters) above the surface. It was claimed to be the coldest region in his entire plane, though in reality its frigid temperatures were surpassed by the Mountain of Ultimate Winter .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Cryonax's primary goal was to raise the influence of his domain so that it could one day become a fifth base elemental plane; thus, he constantly sought out territory among the elemental planes to conquer, though Cryonax was a careful schemer and he had much grander ambitions, plotting to one day surpass and usurp the other elemental forces of the Inner planes , and beyond that, strove to one day freeze the entire multiverse .</p>
<p>He also sought to unleash the Archdevil Levistus , but for what reason was unknown.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Unlike the other Evil Archomentals, there was neither a ruler of an opposing elemental force nor Good Archomental counterpart actively competing against his interests. The closest thing to the former was Chilimba (also - Chilimbia), but Cryonax did not consider them a credible threat mainly beacuse they were not a archomental but just a powerful mephit</p>
<p>On his own plane Cryonax was opposed by the Great White Wyrm, Albrathanilar , a potent and cunning wizard. The local immoths and some Ice mephits also opposed Cryonax's rule, mainly through living in isolation, though the latter had been known to aid his enemies.</p>
<p>His army consisted of ice archons , frost giants , ice crabs , ice mephits, ice para-elementals , ice toads , white dragons , white puddings , winter wolves , and druids who specialized in cold-based magic.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>One legend claimed that Cryonax was a primordial who was once a demon lord who had tried and failed to conquer the Elemental Chaos .</p>
<p>A djinni in service of a pasha from Calimshan believed that the Ring of Winter had the power to summon Cryonax.</p>
<p>Legend holds that back during the Dawn War , in a battle on a now-forgotten mountain top, Cryonax shattered his teeth upon the armor of the dwarven god Moradin and that jagged primordial shards of this could still be found today.</p>
<p>More recent rumors claimed that within the Chiseled Estate lived a coven of enslaved planetouched wizards and priests , many of them either ice genasi or water genasi , who worked tirelessly to develop new forms of ice-based monsters for Cryonax's army. Another rumor attached to his fortress was that it drew power from the Negative Energy plane , though for what reason was never stated.</p>
