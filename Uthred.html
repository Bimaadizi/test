In the process, he cast several spells, including presumably invisibility sphere , fireball , ice storm , and blink .

In the final fight against the dracolich that protected the Cult's enclave, Uthred was seen using levitate and fireball .</p>
<h2>Debriefing</h2>
<p>After Quelsandas cast the aggravate dracorage spell in the Gray Forest , routing the forces of Impiltur on behalf of the Cult of the Dragon on Tarsakh 12 , Uthred was one of the warmages supported the retreat of a group of archers by rendering them invisible and providing cover with spells. After they regrouped thanks to the intervention of Taegan Nightwind and Jivex , Uthred employed divinations to study Vorasaegha 's mound. He was initially skeptical of her recruitability, but Taegan insisted. Later, Uthred was key to a ritual to conceal the entire company in preparation for a final assault on the Cult's enclave. He was slain by the dracolich guardian of the enclave with a breath of corrosive acid.</p>
