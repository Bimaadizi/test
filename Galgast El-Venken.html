<p>Galgast El-Venken was the ulitharid leader of the Sept of Ill'Ghact in 1479 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Galgast originated from a drow host of House Oblodra in 1358 DR and the psionic powers of his host permitted the birth of an ulitharid. Later in the same year, Methil El-Viddenvelp disappeared in the wake of the drow defeat in the assault on Mithral Hall . It was only natural that Galgast assumed the leadership of the Sept, which he led from that point on.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Galgast considered himself the natural leader of his fellows and used them as subordinates, and this was true: in illithid society, only the elder brain was more revered than an ulitharid. He inherited the will of Methil and was determined to finish his work of creating a new elder brain.</p>
