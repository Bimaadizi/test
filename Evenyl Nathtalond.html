<p>When in the 1369 DR , the Simbul set out to slay Azmyrandyr , Roeblen and Thaltar , three Red Wizards who had participated in a direct attack on Alustriel Silverhand , High Lady of Silverymoon while she was in her own palace, Evenyl was in the city of Velprintalar at the time. She was called on, alongside the Simbul's three other closest apprentices, to serve as regent in her absence. She responded to the call, but arrived last, and breathless.</p>
<p>In 1372 DR , at one point the Simbul had to stop holding court to set out in her rescue of Elminster Aumar from Avernus . While preparing for her journey, she bid Evenyl slay a red wizard in disguise at her court as one of her first acts. She was present in the throne room when the Simbul returned with a rescued Elminster.</p>
<p>She endured the Spellplague by "riding the Weave", returning circa 1400 DR and becoming a founder of the Simbarch council. The four apprentices remained active well past 1479 DR , the year of the Simbul's ultimate destruction.</p>
