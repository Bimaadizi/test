<p>The community of Kond was carved into the steep cliffs along the southern side of the Clefts of Razack above the Beaumaris River in Vaasa .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It served as a stop for trade goods that had been floated down the Beaumaris from Moortown . The folk used an ingenious system of winches and pulleys , along with magic from some warlocks , to get the goods up the 500‑foot (150‑meter) cliff face to the wagons waiting at the rim.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kond was originally a delve for minotaurs , but they were routed in the Year of the Strangled Jester, 1453 DR by the Warlock Knights of Vaasa .</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , it was a waypoint along the Dead Man's Walk , which scaled up from the canyon floor to the west to the top of the cliffs to the east.</p>
