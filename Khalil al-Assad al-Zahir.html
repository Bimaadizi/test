<p>Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir was the Grand Caliph of Huzuz , the City of Delights in 1367 DR , and the eighteenth of his line.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Khalil was still strong and lean into middle age thanks to his time spent adventuring.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>During his frequent excursions through the city while disguised, Khalil was known to shower lavish gifts on those who treated him well.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Khalil possessed many items both mundane and magical including: bracers of defense , cloak of protection , boots of striding and springing , ring of free action , ring of spell storing , rod of leadership , and his favorite scimitar named "Breeze Across the Desert Sands" that was a scimitar of sharpness .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Khalil became Grand Caliph at the age of 18 when his father died. Thoroughly unprepared for the demands of court, the young caliph rebelled against the suggestions of his advisers and viziers, often slipping outside of the palace in disguise or disappearing for months at a time on adventures. For nearly 12 years Khalil led the life of an adventurer with prolific aid from his uncles Prince Tannous al-Assad and Prince Cheddah al-Assad . They would often provide aid in the form of the finest weaponry and armor, magical items, and powerful allies. Makin al-Mutrattab , his cousin, often accompanied him on these excursions. Ironically, the more he traveled the Land of Fate , the more Khalil realized the need for a strong Grand Caliph.</p>
