<p>A Wand of conducting was a common magical wand that created music.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>With this wand, the caster was able to create beautiful orchestral music while waving it around like a conductor. The music from the wand could be heard up at a distance of up to 60 feet (18 meters). When the caster stopped waving the wand around, the music ended. The wand had three charges, which were recharged daily at dawn. When the caster used the last charge, there was a chance the wand could spontaneously crumble into dust, while playing a mournful note from a tuba.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hundreds of years prior to 1492 DR , a basilisk in the Maddgoth's Castle level of Undermountain consumed a wand of conducting that became trapped intact within its stomach when an adventurer reflected its petrifying gaze back at the basilisk with a mirror .</p>
