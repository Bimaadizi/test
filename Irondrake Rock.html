<p>Irondrake Rock was a valley with a rocky spire in the Stonelands until the mid–14 th century DR . In late 1357 DR , it became known as Delg's Dell .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Formerly, Irondrake Rock was a straight spire visible from afar in the Stonelands. Around it was a grassy meadow with rocky, sheer walls, forming a valley where the ground level rose closest to the spire, giving it a vaguely funnel-like shape. After 1357 DR, the eponymous rock had been reduced to a puddle of melted stone.</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>There was a grotto at the base of the spire. At the top of the spire was a portal to a section south of Stone Stand , within the High Forest .</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>Once, there were tall grass, weeds, and wild flowers in the meadow and birds nested Irondrake Rock. A dragon was said to have once made its lair here, after which the spire was named, according to Mirt.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Shandril Shessair 's party, led by Mirt , came to Irondrake Rock, where the moneylender sought the hidden portal .
