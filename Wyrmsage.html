<p>Wyrmsage was a plant found in Northwest Faerûn , valued for its arcane properties and its usage as a spell reagent in certain magics.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Wyrmsage extract was dried and mixed with certain other reagents to produce a powder that could be sprinkled on dead bodies, interfering with necromancy and protecting the corpses from being raised by all but more powerful magics. Some believed that the powder suppressed negative energy and allowed souls trapped within the dead to escape; however, more scholarly mages knew that that was just a dramatic assumption on the properties of souls, but the effect of the powder was indisputable.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the hero remembered as Kalach-Cha , and later, as The Knight-Captain, was framed by the slaughter of the village of Ember . The hero and their companions set out to investigate the charred ruins. In the process, they met Nya , a herbalist of Port Llast , who sold them wyrmsage powder to sprinkle over the slaughtered villages, preventing them from returning as the undead .</p>
