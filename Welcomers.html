<p>The Welcomers , also called the Welcoming Committee , was the lone thieves' guild in Phlan as of 1367 DR .</p>
<p>Most of the natives of Phlan knew the guildmembers by sight, perhaps because of their overt operations or their unique self-mutilation, prompting the guild to mostly target visitors to the city and adopt their sarcastic guild name.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>Members of the Welcomers notoriously cut off their left ear to prove their loyalty to the guild.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Though not officially sanctioned, the guild was allowed to exist because of their usefulness as scouts and defenders of Phlan during the past.</p>
