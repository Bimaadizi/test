<p>Yasha was a gambler. In 1374Â DR , he played Three-Dragon Ante against Warian Datharathi somewhere north of Cathyr in Dambrath ; the last hand was interrupted by Bui the Hog , who chose that moment to pick a fight with Warian. He restrained Warian early in the fight, and then attempted to expertly disable him with a blood choke. Warian's arm awakened to its powers while in that blood choke, and Yasha was thrown into a wall, where he stopped moving. Warian left the tavern afterwards before finding out whether Yasha's injuries were mortal.</p>
