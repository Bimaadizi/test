<p>Deirex Jae'llat was a powerful drow lich who founded the city of Ust Natha .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The lich owned a tower in Ust Natha, which was protected by a guard and several wards. A magical rope from Visaj could penetrate the wards on the lowest floor, allowing entry. It would also protect the owner from a lich's imprisonment spell.</p>
<p>Deirex owned a ward stone for House Jae'llat , without which one could not enter the house. He also had a special tooth, which acted as a key for the doors in his tower, as well as his treasure vault at the top of the tower. His tower contained many powerful spell scrolls .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In about 1369 DR , a member of Bregan D'aerthe , called Visaj, told Gorion's Ward 's party that the lich had captured many of Jarlaxle 's men. The party was told that Deirex used magical purple gems to store the imprisoned souls of his enemies. Apparently, however, this was just a ruse by Jarlaxle and Visaj, in order for the party to acquire these expensive gems from Deirex Jae'llat. Jarlaxle, as a result of his cunning, settled matters with House Jae'llat, who'd previously humiliated him.</p>
