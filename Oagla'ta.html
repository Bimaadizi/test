<h2>History</h2>
<p>Oagla'ta and Nyzeil Nighthammer came together sometime before the Year of Storms, 1310 DR . Both women were bigger, stronger, and much more kind-hearted than most males of their races, Nyzeil, among duergar , and Oagla'ta, among half-orcs . The couple traveled to the city of Silverymoon , where they became targets of harassment and bigotry from the town's watch. S'feria Ranul , a kindly drow Silverstar of Selûne , witnessed the treatment and got involved, sheltering the couple from prejudice. Grateful and realizing they shared faith and values, Nyzeil and Oagla'ta joined S'feria Ranul's adventure troupe - the Sisters of the Blood Moon .</p>
<p>Oagla'ta and her partner were the group's muscles, being more formidable than most males in battle. One fateful night, the trip encountered a goblin ambush in a forest outside Silverymoon. Serendipitously, three adventuring heroes came along the site of the battle and rushed to their aid. The heroes were a rock gnome rogue Kylei Shadowhand , her twin sister wizard Hylei , and a ranger Half-elf Nevae Quar . The group dispatched bandits with ease, battling in synch, S'feria became enamored with the new allies' battle prowess and convinced them to join her adventuring band.</p>
<p>In 1310 DR, S'feria Ranul received a letter – a plea for help from the town of Targos in Icewind Dale . Despite the promise of gold and fame, S'feria led her Sisters to the northern city, answering its pleas for help.</p>
