<p>Annam's unblinking eye was a rare giant rune that allowed its caster to replicate the eponymous deity's ability to gaze upon any creature throughout the multiverse .</p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>By pouring water into the inscribed bowl, the caster activated the rune's effect— scrying , similar to that of a crystal ball —revealing in the water's reflection the targeted individual and their surroundings. If the target was a living creature then it and the caster would feel an ominous chill for the duration of this scrying.</p>
<p>The unblinking eye could not relay sound and was limited to transmitting visual information. The duration of the rune's effect would last for a number of minutes equivalent to the caster's level. A caster could study this rune extensively for an unlimited number of times and the number of times they studied it would multiply the rune's base duration.</p>
<p>If the three instances of the unblinking eye were not perfectly and evenly spaced around its circumference, then the inscribed bowl would shatter upon activation.</p>
<h2>Components</h2>
<p>Like most giant runes, it required no material components to cast, though the caster needed to know the giant rune transformation . The process of shaping this rune generally took around three to four hours and it needed to be done with rare pigments that typically cost around 1,000 gp .</p>
<p>The caster needed to inscribe the true name of their target creature upon the base of a large, deep bowl. Finally, they needed to inscribe the unblinking eye three times around the outside of that bowl and have them evenly spaced around its circumference.</p>
