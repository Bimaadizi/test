<p>Circa the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , the city of Lachom became menaced by a gang of fire giants of the Deepwing Mountains. Kinondra's band raided several farms around the city but refrained from attacking Lachom itself. In response, the city's Mayor Turien Battlewake put out a call for capable adventurers to resolve the giant threat. Unbeknownst to most, Kinondra was hired by a short-term Lord Simon Dessino of Arrabar who was attempting to show Lachom that the city needed Chondath 's protection.</p>
