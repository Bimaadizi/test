<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These weapons were available in a wide variety of scimitars .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A scimitar of shame was magically enhanced to make striking and injuring opponents easier compared to using a normal weapon. Upon command the wielder could activate the weapon's true powerâ€”unleashing a magical assault on the target's honor. If they target was unable to resist this onslaught then they behaved as if under the influence of a taunt spell, immediately rushing to attack the wielder of the scimitar with no regard for their surroundings. These magical taunts also interrupted spellcasting or other similar activities.</p>
