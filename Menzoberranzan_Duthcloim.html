<p>Duthcloim , also known as Manyfolk , was a district in the drow city of Menzoberranzan .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The district of Duthcloim surrounded the Bazaar and the Clawrift , a huge chasm in the center of the city. Its narrow streets were filled with shops and three-story tallhouses carved from stalagmites. Patrols deterred most open crime.</p>
<p>Duthcloim was known for being the most colorful, diverse, and tolerant district of the city. It was home to many merchants and family houses (both noble and commoner). Nearly all drow commoners in Menzoberranzan lived in or had originated in Duthcloim. Many noble houses maintained secondary (often secret) houses in the district. Many non-drow lived in this district and were generally treated peaceably by all but noble-born drow, but they were not allowed to openly worship any deity but Lolth .</p>
<p>Drow living in the neighboring district of West Wall , which had few (if any) shops, preferred to shop in Duthcloim.</p>
