<p>Hames was an undead pirate in service to Garrundar in the Pirate Skyhold north of Neverwinter .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hames was a commander of the very powerful band of sky pirates led by Bartholomew Blackdagger . At one time, the sky pirates tried to capture Garrundar but they failed spectacularly and the black dragon pursued them back to their hideout. Garrundar took control of the lizardfolk that lived there and he weaved a powerful spell that cursed the pirates into undeath and bound them to him.</p>
<p>In 1484 DR , Company Yargo , needing a base and more sky ships, sent an adventurer to clear the area. The adventurer fought and killed Hames before they arrived at the dragon.</p>
