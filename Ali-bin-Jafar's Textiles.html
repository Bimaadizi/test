<p>Ali-bin-Jafar's Textiles was a shop in the Central Trade Lanes of Skullport in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Ali-bin-Jafar's Textiles was a two-story establishment of fair condition, marked at its entrance by a brightly patterned curtain.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The interior functioned as a warehouse for a wide variety of fabrics, threads, and rare carpets sourced from regions such as Kara-Tur , Calimshan , Zakhara , and the Hordelands .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Alongside regular trade in textiles, the shop also served as a conduit for contraband. Bolts of inexpensive cloth frequently concealed smuggled items moved in collaboration with the Xanathar's Thieves' Guild and Misker .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Despite the shop's exotic name, its proprietor, an ostensible “Ali-bin-Jafar”, is actually a Skullport native named Bertrem Thinwick, who adopted the alias to enhance his business appeal. Known for his genial manner and adept bargaining skills, “Ali” often succeeded in persuading even the most frugal customers to pay premiums for average-quality goods.</p>
