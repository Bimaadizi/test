<p>Scattertrail boots was a pair of unique enchanted boots that belonged to the adventuring druid Darya Scattertrail of the High Forest sometime before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The boots' magic was only usable when a druid wore them. They slightly improved the wearer's ability to move silently through any terrain, and once per day, the boots allowed the wearer to move freely through any terrain and ignore magical effects that would hinder or restrain them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Darya Scattertrail and her adventuring companions found themselves opposing a rogue Red Wizard of Thay who sought to tap into the dark powers of Hellgate Keep . The adventurers killed the Red Wizard's guards with ease, but the mage was not easy prey and unleashed spells that immobilized Darya's friend. Her companions were devoured by summoned demons . Terrified, the druid used her boots' magics to flee, leaving her companions to their fate. Eventually, her panic subsided, leaving nothing but shame in Darya's heart. The woman threw all of her adventuring gear to the ground, including her magic footwear, and forever left the High Forest. Later known as Scattertrail boots , Darya's footwear found its way into the hands of Dayne Lynneth , a merchant from Tyr's Eye plaza in the Blacklake District of Neverwinter in 1374 DR.</p>
