<p>Ildilyntra Starym was a matriarch of the Starym clan of elves in of Cormanthyr in the 3 rd century DR . She was a chief opponent of Coronal Eltargrim Irithyl 's plan to open Cormanthor to non-elves, and took her own life to form a blood dragon in an attempt to slay the elven ruler.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ildilyntra was known for her dark eyes that glinted gold when she was full of emotion, and her dark blue-black hair, which she wore unbound and so long it nearly touched the ground. She had perfect blue-white skin that shone brilliantly.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>Ildilyntra once had a relationship with Coronal Eltargrim, as friends and possibly lovers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ildilyntra, angered by the Coronal's refusal to halt his plans for the Opening (in which all races could come to Cormanthor and enjoy its beauty), came to him in the Year of the Hippogriff's Folly, 241 DR to plead with him in person. When he still would not be swayed, she took her own life with her honor blade, stabbing herself once in the breast, the neck, and the eye, to form a blood dragon that would attempt to slay Eltargrim. The Coronal defeated the dragon with magic and her attempt was in vain. Despite this attack, the Coronal had her buried with full honors and returned her family's relics without question.</p>
