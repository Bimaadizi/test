<p>Lake Bluesprings was one of two lakes on the island of Iligh么n , off the shores of the Vilhon Reach .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The lake began in the waters of the Calling River , cascading from the Elder Spires at the heart of Iligh么n. The river ran south and eventually expanded into Lake Bluesprings before forming a river once again and reaching the delta that fed into the Sea of Fallen Stars. Lake Bluesprings and the Calling River separated the island's lush forests into two, the Great Forest to the east, and Grandlore Forest to the west.</p>
<p>For the most inhabitants of the city of Sapra on Iligh么n, the shores of Lake Bluesprings were a rarely-crossed border. Beyond, laid untamed wilderness of druid -protected forests. Lake Bluesprings' shores also served as a popular getaway of Saprans.</p>
