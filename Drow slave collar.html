<p>Drow slave collars were a kind of magical control device used by the drow of Sschindylryn in the 15 th century DR , finding extensive use during the invasion of Eveningstar .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The collars were heavy metal constructions that fitted around the neck, requiring either the correct key or deft skill to remove safely.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When worn by a slave , their body was put under the control of nearby taskmasters, without their mind being directly affected. This left them lucid and aware of what was happening, without any ability to do more than speak on their own volition. Without the presence of a nearby controller they might be left to their own devices, or just left helpless as their body waited for commands.</p>
<p>If the collar was tampered with, such as in an escape attempt, a failsafe would instantly kill the wearer, though it could potentially be safely unlocked with proficient skills and a good dose of luck.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The drow of Sschindylryn used these collars on their own drow underclass, and as the war with Cormyr began they began to use them upon captured surfacer prisoners, including villagers, War Wizards , and Purple Dragons . While all groups used them, they were most common with House Avithoul , the preeminent slave traders in the city, and House Cay'Vorym , who used the slaves as entertainment in the Underdark Arena and Cay'Vorym Fighting Pit . During the war, the Sschindylrynyr used enslaved surfacers as forced labor in their various projects, but most notably expended them on the battlefield as shock troops and bodyguards, parallel to House Szind 's use of reanimated Cormyreans as zombies . While the civilians were none too effective in combat, the use of unwilling Cormyreans against their own folk—often while crying for mercy or screaming in horror—was a potent psychological weapon. The only way to counter this tactic was to somehow avoid killing the collared fighters while searching for their slavemaster, who was usually hidden nearby, and then attempt to safely remove the collars without killing the victims.</p>
<p>Mirini Elemys was a rare example of a successful escapee. Through patience, cunning, and opportunity, she managed to unlock her own collar and escaped from the Underdark to the World Above , where she organized a devastating raid on House Avithoul's estate.</p>
