<p>The Hall of the Raven , also known as Raven Hall , was a massive keep in Ravens Bluff and the stately home of the city's Knights Council .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Hall of the Raven stood on the corner of Raphiel Road & Raven Way , in the Altarside neighborhood of Ravens Bluff's Temple District .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>This keep was an imposing structure, standing five stories tall and noted for its arched windows.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Knights Council conducted all knightly title ceremonies within the Hall of the Raven. Following the destruction of the Ravens Bluff Hall of Records in 1371 DR , the keep was also used as an archive for the records of all knightly orders.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On a late night in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , a large fire broke out in the Ravens Bluff Hall of Records. The building was completely destroyed by the blaze before the Red Ravens could control it, burning many records of the city's knightly orders. Not all of these records were completely lost, as many had copies stored within the Raven Museum in case of just such a blaze. The Knights Council had a swift and pronounced response to the incident, promptly printing fliers requesting all knights in the city to notify the Council of their allegiances by providing copies of their official heraldry, the names of their sponsors (the knights who wrote their letters of recommendation), and any awards and knightly honors they own.</p>
<p>In the wake of this, it came to light that there were many bogus knights in Ravens Bluff with no proper claim to their title, a criminal offense under Ravenian law. These knight impersonators, a majority of whom were adventurers , had their titles stripped away. Additionally, the Knights Council made a staunch vow that from then on the records for all knightly orders were going to be safely kept within the Hall of the Raven, even if the Hall of Records was rebuilt.</p>
