<p>Carp hengeyokai ( pronounced : / h ɛ n g ɛ j oʊ k aɪ / hen-geh-yo-kigh ) or simply carps were a carp -based subrace of the hengeyokai , a race of intelligent natural shapechanging animals able to adopt carp, human , and hybrid forms. They shared all the common traits and habits of hengeyokai, plus those discussed below.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In human form, a hengeyokai had some feature reminiscent of their animal form. Carps might have short statures, large eyes, and pale skin.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Compared to humans and the average hengeyokai, carps were slightly wiser but less strong, or they were more agile. They were adept in endurance skills.</p>
<p>In their animal form, carps were of course excellent swimmers, but they could not swim like fish in their bipedal forms. Nevertheless, even swimming like humanoids in their hybrid forms, they were very good swimmers, faster than in their smaller animal forms. They had good skill in swimming generally and could breathe underwater. However, they were significantly slower walking on land than humans .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>On the whole, carps were good-hearted.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>They were known to hibernate in the winter.</p>
<p>Carps, along with cranes , dogs , hares , and monkeys , were more likely to become monks than other hengeyokai.</p>
<h2>Known Communities</h2>
<p>The "lake folk" of Nam Tso in Tabot in the mid–14 th century DR were a school of kindly carps. As they'd rescued some fishermen and a little girl from the lake, they'd earned the respect and aid of the local people in Bidnop So by 1357 DR . Here, they traded rice and opals from the lake bed for things they couldn't manufacture.</p>
