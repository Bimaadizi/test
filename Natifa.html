<p>Natifa was a ghost who inhabited the Burning Pool of Natifa in Zakhara in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>Natifa appeared as an elderly woman.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Natifa inhabited the bottom of the pool, but sometimes she would emerge to perch atop the fountain. Natifa asked any strangers who approached the pool if they would prepare a meal. Those who declined were either asked to leave or had flaming arafaj hurled at them, depending on Natifa's mood. Those who agreed were asked to name the dish they planned on making. Natifa was intrigued by the more exotic dishes. Any special ingredients needed for the meal were supplied by Natifa, but the strangers were required to use the oven located at the southern end of the pool. Upon completion of the meal, Natifa would sample the dish. Her disapproval earned the stanger a toss into the burning pool. Dishes earning her approval were rewarded with information, typically about travelling in the High Desert . Natifa could also predict the weather with uncanny accuracy and inform strangers of bandit movements.</p>
