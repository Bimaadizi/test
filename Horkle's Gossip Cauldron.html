<p>Horkle's Gossip Cauldron was a widely popular broadsheet based in Waterdeep on the Sword Coast North . It was published by Annath Horkle in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>This broadsheet was written in a rather blunt and honest manner with obscenities. When it came to reporting on the deeds and words of public officials that it disliked—which included most guildmasters and elder nobility—the Cauldron was not above embellishing or wholesale fabricating things.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>One of the incidences reported on by the Cauldron were the strange goings on of the skyship The Storm Bird .</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Many Masked Lords of Waterdeep, senior officers of the City Watch , and palace officials considered the broadsheet's style of writing to be often profane and blunt to the point of rudeness. However, many readers treasured its blunt honesty.</p>
