<p>A Waukeen's Defender was a variety of enchanted shield wielded by the Waukeenar clergy across Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A Waukeen's Defender was decorated with the golden visage of the goddess Waukeen herself.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These shields were enchanted with a potent +2 magic that increased the wielder's protection and offered additional protection from missiles. Additionally, it offered the wielder a slight boost to their fortitude, will, and reflexes. The shields' magics were woven in such a manner that they retained the enchantments only as long as the image of Waukeen on the front was uncovered and unaltered. If the owner did not follow these instructions, a Waukeen's Defender lost all of its magic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Waukeen's Defenders first appeared in circulation some years before 1281 DR . They were crafted by temples dedicated to the Merchant's Friend all across Faerûn and sold to clever adventurers , who were instructed to show the image of Waukeen everywhere they went in exchange for the shields' magical protection. One such shield was in the hands of Quinn Silverfinger , a cleric of Waukeen in the Golden Lodge of Lonelywood .</p>
