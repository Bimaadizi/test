<p>A wheelchair , also called a wheeled chair , was a small vehicle that enabled mobility for people who could not walk or had another physical impairment.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was simply a chair with attached wheels. They could be comfortable and some were equipped with a small desk for writing and work and others with awnings to shade against the sun. Wheeled chairs used by the nobility might be painted and adorned with their family badge. Wheelchairs could be pushed by others.</p>
<p>A basic, improvised form of wheelchair was a light wheelbarrow , while a litter or palanquin could be used for the same purpose.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>With a wheelchair, a user could move faster than they otherwise might, but only to about half the speed of a non-impaired human , and they made it more difficult to defend oneself in battle. However, experienced users might find it no burden on their abilities, instead operating as though it was a part of them.</p>
<p>A wheelchair could make it inconvenient for a user to enter certain areas, while a multiple-story building might need an elevator installed for them.</p>
