<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Nimra's older daughter, Jithelle, worked as a servant at the noble House Pharaboldi . The young woman was seduced and bedded by the family's youngest offspring, Denrick Pharaboldi . Jithelle fell for the man and thought that he cared for her. When the young servant became pregnant with Pharaboldi bastard, she thought that her child would be able to get a better life through the noble father. However, that was not to be. Denrick Pharaboldi was a cruel and selfish man, just like his mother, Anista Pharaboldi . They ordered the young servant to be murdered in order for her not in interfered with an arranged political marriage into the Matrell clan of Arrabar.</p>
<p>Jithelle was killed under the pretense of her claiming to be an arcane spellcaster, and she was murdered alongside a fellow servant â€“ Hoytir , to explain the pregnancy. Nimra was devastated by the loss of her oldest child. She knew of the bastard child, as Jithelle shared the happy news with their family. Also, Nimra knew that the claims of the imposter crime were a lie as the young woman could not even read. A day after the grave news reached Nimra and Mirolyn, the women were contacted by Vambran Matrell , who knew the girl's death was unjust, and he sought justice.</p>
<p>Several weeks later, after the justice was served to the young woman's murderers, the Skolotti family was offered a new home. Hetta Matrell , the matriarch of the House Matrell, feeling guilty over her family's hand in Jithelle's death, invited Nimra and her surviving daughter to relocate to the Matrell estate. The offer was eagerly accepted. Mirolyn offered to help the family with keeping an eye on the young twins Obiron and Quindy , while Nimra retired in comfort and surrounded by friendly faces. Sometime later, Nimra and her daughter witnessed an attempt on Hetta Matrell's life that left her spirit bound to a ring , a retaliation for Vambran's actions that brought Jithelle's murderers to justice.</p>
