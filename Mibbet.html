<p>Mibbet the Meddler was a mage who lived somewhere in West Faerûn in the mid 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Boot, 1343 DR , Mibbet's intuition led the man to casting the stone to flesh spell on The Statue of Jondar the Valiant that stoot atop a cube pedestal , carved with medusae faces, at the center of a fountain in the town of Ithmong . To everyone's shock, the statue turned into a living flesh and blood woman, who stepped down from the pedestal, thanked Mibbet, and walked off.</p>
