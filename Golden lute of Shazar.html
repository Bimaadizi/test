The cure serious wounds spell cast at a high proficiency level could be dispensed once per day, and the same went for a powerful version of a haste spell.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ten golden lutes of Shazar were commissioned by Shazar long before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , to serve as a gift for the pharaoh of the time. The pharaoh, a creature of musical taste and thunderous temper, was delighted hearing the ten golden lutes sing in the hands of master minstrels . Unbeknownst to the pharaoh, skill-busting enchantments were weaved into the instruments, allowing the minstrels to perform beyond their natural skills. Eventually, the ruler found out about the magic and took it as a great offense. Shazar and his minstrels were executed. Despite the incident, the pharaoh kept all ten lutes, and after his death, they were interred along with the pharaoh.</p>
<p>Many years later, the pharaoh's tomb was plundered, and the ten golden lutes of Shazar were scattered across Faerûn . In 1374 DR , one of the lutes belonged to a musician Cain Lethellon , who cockily challenged bards and entertainers to a lute-off in the Blacklake District of Neverwinter . Some said that the minstrel was beaten in his own competition by the famed Kalach-Cha or one of their companions, losing the Golden lutes of Shazar as a result.</p>
