<p>Hamid al-Bashshar was one of the newest members of the Corsair Council of Hawa by 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hamid was once a member of the Dutiful Mamluk Society . After his village was nearly destroyed by ravagers and he was taken prisoner, Hamid managed to escape and traveled to the Corsair Domains , where he begged to join the corsairs to aid in the fight against his former captors. His desire to remove his tattoos and successfully passing a detect lie spell convinced the Corsair Council that he was being truthful. He was given a place on Akura al-Hiyali 's ship. His keen intellect and hatred for the mamluks showed the Council that Hamid would be more useful to them if provided command of his own ship.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Facial scars marred Hamid's visage, courtesy of removing the tattoos he was given during his time as a mamluk for the Dutiful. He had wavy black hair and hazel eyes and was once considered handsome. In order to hide his scars, Hamid always wore a veil.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Hamid was a natural actor.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Secretly, Hamid was a spy for the Dutiful. He worked hard to help other spies infiltrate Hawa and waited for the perfect opportunity to flee back to Qudra and report to his real masters.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The mamluks of the Dutiful gave Hamid an amulet of proof against detection and location and two philters of glibness to help on his spying mission.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Though he spied for the mamluks, Hamid came to like many of the corsairs he met in Hawa. Only a direct attack against Qudra would prompt him to turn his back on his new friends.</p>
