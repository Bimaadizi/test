<p>Rassiter was a wererat soldier and the leader of the wererats of Calimport .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>While Artemis Entreri was away searching for Regis , Pasha Pook allied with Rassiter and used him and his men as enforcers.</p>
<p>When Artemis returned with Regis, Rassiter considered his position in danger and tried to block the assassin. Rassiter was also involved in fighting with the Companions of the Hall during this time. In the end, the wererats were exterminated by Astral Plane panthers and Pook was killed, so Rassiter tried to ally with Entreri to become the rulers of the streets of Calimport, but the assassin said that he worked alone and easily killed him.</p>
