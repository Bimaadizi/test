<p>Traitor's Isle was an unoccupied island that formed one of the two islands of Prespur in the Sea of Fallen Stars .</p>
<p>The only site of interest was the Tower of Stars , created and used by Jorunhast , former Royal Wizard of Cormyr . The island's coastline was jagged and rocky, making travel there by boat extremely difficult and hazardous.</p>
