<p>Falmor Duguir was a reader of the Baldur's Mouth Gazette broadsheet from the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Falmor Duguir came across an issue of Baldur's Mouth Gazette on his recently passed uncle's desk. The issue's puzzle section titled "Win a Peek at Candlekeep " was half finished. Falmor put some time and effort into the puzzle and eventually completed it. He penned a letter for the Puzzle Editor of the Gazette and enclosed the solved puzzle, asking who he would need to talk to claim the prize. Falmor also asked if he were to come to the Baldur's Mouth building in the Lower City, would Ettvard Needle be the person to talk to, as he also had a piece of his mind to give to the Editor-in-Chief.</p>
<p>Soon after, a gang assembled by Churg Elvek , secretly a cultist of the Absolute , sought to strengthen the cult's grasp on Baldur's Gate. When the famed writer Volothamp Geddarm returned to the Gate after misadventures in the Emerald Grove and coming face-to-face with the Absolute's army, Volo became a target for Churg and his gang. The master traveler was captured and tied to a stack of smokepowder barrels, ready to be "brought to justice" for being an alleged agent of the Absolute at the hands of the gang and street gawkers. Falmor Duguir was one of the commoners in the gathered crowd, who was swayed by Churg Elvek's accusations. Luckily, the band known as the Absolute Adversaries interrupted the street execution.</p>
