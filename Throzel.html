<p>Throzel was a tamed riding wyvern that served an unnamed mage agent of Zhentil Keep in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Throzel was wounded by several arrows that punctured its left wing not far from the southeastern edge of the Mere of Dead Men . The wyvern's hander was attempting to find a medicine man or a cleric to heal the damaged wing. The handler could not reveal his Black Network affiliation for fear of being killed or arrested. The Zhentish agent claimed that he was a creature tamer that worked for the Mooney & Sons Traveling Circus and Throzel was his recently tamed beast. The agent claimed that the duo was about to travel to Waterdeep to deliver Throzel to Mooney & Sons' just intimate for their final performance as a gang of bandits ambushed them and wounded the creature. This, of course, was a lie as Mooney & Sons departed Waterdeep in the spring of Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR and were not scheduled to return for some time.</p>
<p>If the Zhent's lies were uncovered, he was surely to threaten the healer and reveal his plant to travel east back to Zhentil Keep. If the healer was not versed in circus schedules, the Zhent man was more than happy to compensate them for the aid.</p>
