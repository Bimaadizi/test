<p>The "community of the high brows" was a mountain giant tribe dwelling in the Orbrekh in the Orsraun Mountains of Turmish .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The community of the high brows was led by Oogle , its shaman , in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR . There were about 30 to 35 mountain giants in the tribe.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>The giants wished only to be left alone in peace. Their relative peacefulness made the Orbrekh the safest part of the Orsrauns for travellers.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The mountain giants decimated the Onusclan orcs , who dwelt in the northern Orsrauns, whenever they crossed into the Orbrekh.</p>
<p>The community had an unknown relationship with the Emerald Enclave , which saw Enclave druids regularly visiting the tribe.</p>
