<p>Mithtyn was the herald of Uthgrael Aumar in the early 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>By 240 DR, his voice had grown dry from disuse.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>In King Uthgrael Aumar 's court, he had been the herald.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point during King Uthgrael's reign, Mithtyn, then the herald, had daced with the individual who would later take the identity of Myrjala Talithyn , though she bore a different look at the time.</p>
<p>After Prince Elminster Aumar 's forces retook Athalgard in Year of the Chosen, 240 DR , Mithtyn was called to court as one of those who had been in Uthgrael's court, per the request of the sorceress Myrjala Talithyn. There, she revealed to him they'd danced before, a long time ago. He was taken aback. During the subsequent dance as a new king was crowned, Mithtyn tried to stay out of the dancing, but the sorceress would have none of that, and with the help of onlookers, made him join the dance.</p>
<p>Mithtyn later waved off Elminster Aumar and Myrjala as they rode away together, though he was uneasy about a prophecy by Alaundo that said the Aumar line would outlive the Stag Throne. Myrjala assured him, so long as Elminster lived, the line would endure. Anxious to tell someone about Myrjala, he found himself approached by the Knight of Athalantar Anauviir , and took him to the kitchens, where he meant to tell him the history as he knew it.</p>
