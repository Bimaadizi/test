<p>Aszhgruzz was a male alguduir , mate of Hizs , one of the two "swamp dragons" who made a home in a swamp and ended lives of several people from a nearby village in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Aszhgruzz and Hizs made a nest in a swamp, planning to raise their young within the boggy lands that were abundant with food. Aszhgruzz and his mate were quite intelligent and required quite a lot of meat to survive, which led them to hunt most living creatures near the nest, including some unlucky villagers. The couple learned to use various swamp beasts to weaken the larger prey before the alguduir were able to swoop from the skies and finish the job. Swamp rohches were among the creatures used by the alguduir to hunt or to defend themselves against adventurers . And adventurers were sure to come. Some were hired by a nearby alchemist - wizard who wanted one of both of the alguduir captured for their spell-reflecting abilities. Others were contracted by the villages after clawed bodies of their kin were discovered near the swamp. Other heroes might've been lured into the swamp by their enemies, hoping that the alguduir would hunt and kill the new prey.</p>
