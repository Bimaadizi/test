<h2>History</h2>
<p>Valmorba's mortuary was established in the Year of the Nether Mountain Scrolls, 1486 DR and offered coffins, funerals, ceremonies, and embalming to the residents of the Gate. By the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , when the strife of serial murders committed by the Cult of Bhaal and the looming war with the Cult of the Absolute , Valmorba's mortuary was overwhelmed. The old woman struggled with procuring and having the coffins built in time. One of the children buried by Valmorba was Ayana , daughter of Fiona . The mother thanked the mortician for going above and beyond for the dead child and burying her teddy bear along with Ayana. Valmorba was known to waive fees when possible for the poor, especially parents burying their children. One of the children was a "water baby," a child who loved the sea. Valmorba prepared the child's body using weavemoss and styled her hair with chuttler's oil .</p>
