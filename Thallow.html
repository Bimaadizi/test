<p>Thallow was a species of plant found growing across the Eastern and Western Heartlands , favored for use in personal hygiene.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Thallow leaves were large, green, and almost rubbery, somewhat reminiscent of the rhubarb plant leaves. The leaves' toughness allowed for the use in personal clean up after nightsoil egestion, especially when on the road. Thallow leaves could also be washed to be reused later. They retained their usefulness and tough fibers for about three days when carried in a pack or a wagon. After three days, thallow shriveled and became fragile.</p>
