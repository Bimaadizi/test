<p>The Homestead Edict was a proclamation made by Lord Orgauth following the Fall of Zhentil Keep in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the last humanoid forces were forced from the city on Kythorn 13 in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , reconstruction of Zhentil Keep began in earnest. Starvation was by far one of the most pressing matters for the citizens still huddling within the city at this time. To help combat this Lord Orgauth issued the "Homestead Edict" that granted plots of land to deserving citizens provided they planted and grew crops to help feed the starving city.</p>
