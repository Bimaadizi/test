<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Wemick was a strapping young adventurer he moved in the company of another mage called Exeter both part of the Company of the Swan . Once old age found them and they had to retire from active adventuring they both moved into Nellie Thursday Home for Experienced Adventurers and became roommates. As age took Exeter however, became increasingly madder, until he one day disappeared. 15 years later threats were made against the retirement home by Exeter, and Wemick believed he hid in a small demiplane they had discovered during their travels, a demiplane they had named kansas .</p>
<p>Wemick had a scroll of teleport without error that would take him to the Kansas demiplane, but Nellie Thursday , fearing the worst, insisted that he take along some of the more vigorous members of the retirement home. Most of those members were once part of the Company of the Swan , and so Wemick and 5 other retirees went to confront Exeter. The casting of the spell however went wrong and instead the group landed on Olympus , where they met the deity Hermes ; to the jungles of Quorsit ; and finally the demi-plane of Kansas . At last Wemick had caught up with his old friend who had become bitter and mad in his advanced age, and decided that he needed to prove himself better than Wemick, and so managed to set up a challenge where the two old men would fight a duel to the death.</p>
