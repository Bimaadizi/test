<p>Eltorchul Academy was an arcane academy founded by the noble family of the same name and housed at their villa in the Sea Ward of Waterdeep in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Its founder, Lord Thesp Eltorchul , invested the family's spice and import fortune into the academy, along with the acquisition of rare magical components.</p>
<p>The academy was originally only open to nobles and children of means, but the school and family fell on hard times when Lord Thesp's son, Oth Eltorchul , was left incapacitated by a failed magical experiment into the creation of dream spheres in 1368 DR . Since then, Eltorchul Academy was open to almost any student who had the money to pay for tuition, including many elves , half-elves , and halflings . That led to a plummet in the academy's social standing by 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The two leaders of the academy were Lord Thesp Eltorchul and his daughter, Fea Eltorchul .</p>
<p>Danilo Thann was known to have been a student for a time.</p>
