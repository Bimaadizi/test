<p>Groonpeck was a scholar who authored the obnoxiously named book Groonpeck's Field Guide to Terrifying Denizens of the Air, with special appendices for Acheron, the Elemental Planes, and the Abyss sometime long before 1217 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Groonpeck's reputation was that of not the greatest scholar.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1217 DR, Groonpeck's Field Guide to Terrifying Denizens of the Air was used by Lorenzo Utrelli Da Lomarta and his love interest Princess Milianna Mannicci da Sumbria to identify a strange huge seemingly intelligent bird they befriended by accident. The huge bright orange-plumed beast named Tekorriikii was a firebird , a "sacred, untouchable, and extremely dangerous" beast to be avoided at all cost. Even though the book claimed firebirds to be such, the reality proved otherwise.</p>
