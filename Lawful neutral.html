<p>Lawful neutral characters were directed by logic, tradition, or a personal code in their actions. Order and organization, such as those provided by a strong government, were paramount to their beliefs.</p>
<p>Lawful neutral combined reliability and honor without moral bias. While they did not lack a moral compass, they believed ethical considerations were a distant second to what the laws of the land, ancient traditions or their personally held code of conduct dictated. Whether they lived in a benevolent democracy or tyrannical dictatorship, these characters believed the benefits of organization and law outweighed any questions of morality.</p>
<p>A functionary, soldier, or employee who follows orders without question regardless of the result, an arms dealer who sells his wares to the highest bidder, whatever that bidder may do with them, and an impartial jurist who sticks rigidly to the rule book are all examples of lawful neutral characters.</p>
<p>Lawful neutral characters believed in the structure and order that was provided by set rules, regulations and government, regardless of morality. Characters of chaotic neutral alignment completely evaded these in their individualism. These alignments were opposed to one another.</p>
