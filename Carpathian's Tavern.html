<p>Carpathian's Tavern was one of the taverns in Menzoberranzan in the midâ€“14 th century DR . It sold food and beverages.</p>
<p>Adventurers could find Rizzen Do'Urden here. Rizzen offered to make them a map of House Do'Urden , including where the prisoners of their village were being kept, in exchange for the Helm of Spiders . He explained that the helmet had three parts: the base, the crest, and the gem. With it, a drow house could gain a large advantage over others. He later sent them to meet with Jarlaxle , to acquire an insignia of House Do'Urden, without which the house glyphs would destroy them upon entry.</p>
