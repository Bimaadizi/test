<p>Augustavus Cale was the leader, founder, and the guild master of the Trade of Blades guild and freehouse of Neverwinter .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Trade of Blades was founded sometime before 1372 DR by Augustavus Cale. By that year, Augustavus had self-published a book of propaganda and thinly veiled threats to the city of Neverwinterâ€”aptly named The Trade of Blades . In the book, Augustavus claimed that attracting sellswords and ne'er-do-wells would be better than keeping them out of Neverwinter. He advocated for mercenaries to receive accommodation in the city through the Trade of Blades guild and claimed that the only alternative to that was the sellswords turning to banditry and creating unrest and mayhem in Neverwinter.</p>
