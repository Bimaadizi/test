<h2>History</h2>
<p>Joatra originally was just a druid with a good feeling for dire hawks in the Dragonspine Mountains . One day, she saved a group of the Knights of the North from a Zhentarim ambush, thanks to her hawks. So, they offered Joatra a position in the Knights and she accepted. She came to lead the Moonsea skysentinels , a division of the Knights specifically created to counter the Zhentarim skymages .</p>
