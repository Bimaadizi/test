<p>A net was a tool generally intended for fishing or hunting, but which was often adapted as a weapon intended for entangling opponents.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nets were webs of woven rope or cord designed to trap creatures inside them. They were thus useful for fishing and for making hunting snares and traps . A net was easily three times as effective at catching fish as compared to using a fishing rod or spear .</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>Nets intended for fighting were often 8​ to ​12 feet (2.4​ to ​3.7 meters) in diameter and were fitted with barbs or weights to better ensnare the target. They included an attached rope to allow the wielder to throw the net and then control the victim from a distance. To be thrown effectively, a net had to be properly folded such that it would spiral open and engulf the target. Folding a net in the midst of battle took about a minute for a trained wielder. They could generally only be thrown up to about 10 feet (3 meters) or could be dropped on targets from above.</p>
<p>Nets could also be wielded as melee weapons, and skilled wielders could use them to disrupt, parry, and ensnare foes.</p>
<p>Ensnaring a target in a net was an effective way to limit a foe's mobility, to break a spellcaster 's concentration, or to disarm a weapon. A captured target could escape an average net by either cutting through it or tearing through it with sufficient strength, but doing so was often injurious and left them vulnerable to attack.</p>
<p>Nets were a critical component of underwater combat, allowing wielders to trap a target in order to strike. Larger nets could be used to encircle enemies, while thrown nets were heavily weighted in order to both offset the drag of the water and to more effectively limit an ensnared target's mobility. Nets could also be easily concealed or disguised as seaweed in order to set an ambush.</p>
