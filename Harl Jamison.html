<p>Harl Jamison was a legendary hero of the gnomekind who lived in the 9 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Harl Jamison was the leader of the all-gnome adventuring troupe called the Sons of Green Hills , who defended their homelands from ogres and goblins . Even though Harl died of old age in the Year of the Ruby Pendant, 845 DR , the Sons of Green Hills and Harl were immortalized in gnomish folk ballads and tales, still remembered as of the late 13 th century DR. Harl's final resting place, however, was robbed by human grave robbers circa the Year of the Burning Tree, 890 DR , who were thought to steal the gnome's enchanted sling that would later be known as Jamison's sling .</p>
