<h2>History</h2>
<p>Banak was an exceptionally powerful cleric that roamed the Bloodstone Lands the mid-to-late 14 th century DR. During the Vaasan War , it was rumored that he had single-handedly defeated a force of Nar riders by raising an army of undead in the middle of a battle. After the war, circa the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , he raised a small horde of undead to attack Bloodstone Village in retaliation for their defiance against the Citadel of Assassins.</p>
<p>After Gareth Dragonsbane and his party banished his demon patron, Orcus , from Faer√ªn in the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , Banak lost much of his power, and could only cast spells of intermediate power at most. Even so, Banak was experienced enough to remain a great threat to goodly folk of Vaasa and Damara , although none knew the source of his continuing power. While his allies at the time were focused on consolidating wealth, Banak wished to raise an army and once again attempt to conquer the Bloodstone Lands, and this obsession seemed to be driving him mad.</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Banak remained active in Vaasa, and worked to try and raise an army among Zhengyi's old minions. By this time, he was declaring himself to be the "son and heir" of the Witch-King.</p>
