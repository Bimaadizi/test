<p>Dall Nickleplate was the overseer of the Lantan-Samarach portal in the jungles of Samarlogh in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Dall was an irritable and nervous man, wary of outsiders. He tried his best to always rain in control.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Dall Nickleplate was put in charge of the illegal logging operations deep within the Samarlogh. Very few locals knew of the portal and the camp. One of the few such individuals was a merchant of Samargol â€“ Sa'Sani . She made an agreement with Dall Nickleplate to keep the operations secret in exchange for her merchant company's use of the magic transportation device. Sa'Sani did pay fairly for the portal's use.</p>
<p>However, that alliance was threatened when a yuan-ti spy named Luaire Farwander , once an adviser to the Mercantile House and Sa'Sani, attempted to sabotage the portal when his treachery was unveiled. He sought to disrupt the trading company's operations and cut Sa'Sani from her allies on the Sword Coast . Luaire poisoned the portal operator with a specific toxin found in the nearby jungle. With the magic engineer gone and the mechanisms damaged, Dall Nickleplate and his crew became stranded in the jungles, unable to return to Lantan overnight. Dall begrudgingly allowed a group of Sa'Sani's mercenaries into the camp to aid with the poisoning investigation. Inadvertently, the group ended up aiding Dall with several operational troubles that plagued the Lantan-Samarach portal . Overseer Nickleplate suspected the camp's massive logging mechanisms to be moved by hungry dinosaurs at night, so he tasked Sa'Sani's hirelings to hunt the creatures down while the sabotaged portal mechanism was being repaired. As proof, he collects dinosaur claws. Dall hoped to study the claws in order to create a some sort of device that would keep the dinosaur pests at bay.</p>
