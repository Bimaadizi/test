<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Blackcloak alley was originally named after a lone obelisk that stood in its center. Local Waterdhavians believed it to be a boon to their neighborhood as it warded away demons and possessed restorative powers. Any person of "pure heart" that put their hand or other part of their body through the hole in its center was supposedly granted some form of healing.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The street ran parallel with the Way of the Dragon , from the rear of a building on the south side of Brian's Street down toward Kolat Towers .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Some local gangs and thieves were known to prowl along Blackcloak alley. Additionally, children were often known to come by and play games with the alley's obelisk that involved hurling a rag-and-rock ball or coconut through its hole.</p>
