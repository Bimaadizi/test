<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of 1372Â DR , Thaergar had long served the Simbul . During the day in which she went scouring Avernus in search of Elminster , he gave her his belt after she forgot to put on her own, accidentally losing that way a pack of air solitaire cards, and a cheese and string kit for a mouse he liked to play with. The sorceress Phaeldara returned those to him afterwards.</p>
<p>After the tumult upon the return of Elminster , Thaergar managed to prevent Phaeldara from getting crushed by some rubble. It took some time to dig them out.</p>
