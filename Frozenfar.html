<p>The Frozenfar was the coldest, most remote region of the North . It comprised the Spine of the World mountains; the frigid lands to the north and west; including Icewind Dale , the Cold Run , the icebergs of the Sea of Moving Ice , and the northeasternmost part of the Trackless Sea .</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The Frozenfar did not have definable boundaries. The term "Frozenfar" was used by people across Faerûn to include various areas. For example in Amn and the Inner Sea , the term "Frozenfar" referred to the city of Mirabar and everything north, including the Spine of the World mountains. Sometimes the term "Frozenfar" also included the island of Ruathym .</p>
<p>However in the North, the term "Frozenfar" referred only to the lands north of the Spine of the World. That was among the most commonly accepted usage.</p>
<p>Yet others used "Frozenfar" to refer to all the lands of the North within which individuals could literally freeze to death during their travels.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Frozenfar reached the northern peaks of the Spine of the World and extended northwest through the Sea of Moving Ice. It stretched as far east as the Reghed Glacier .</p>
<h2>Geographical features</h2>
<h3>Cold Run</h3>
<p>The Cold Run encompassed the icy tundras west of the Iron Trail and extended all the way to the Sword Coast . It was bordered to the south by the Iceflow river, and to the north by the Shaengarne .</p>
<h3>Icewind Dale</h3>
<p>The tundra of Icewind Dale was named after the freezing winds and snowstorms that blew down from the mountain of Kelvin's Cairn .</p>
<h3>Northeast Trackless Sea</h3>
<p>The northeast of the Trackless Sea bordered the Sea of Moving Ice. This was immediately west of the Cold Run and was considered to be part of the Frozenfar.</p>
<h3>Sea of Moving Ice</h3>
<p>The waters north of the Cold Run and west of Icewind Dale were densely filled with hundreds of shifting icebergs and a number of frozen isles. It was sparsely populated and accommodated only a handful of landmarks and few inhabitants, like ice trolls and tribes of Ice Hunters .</p>
<h3>Spine of the World</h3>
<p>By most accounts, the Spine of the World mountains encompassed the southern reaches of the Frozenfar, separating the whole of the region from the warmer lands to the south.</p>
