<p>Home was a small village of gnomes and halflings in the hinterlands of Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The village was hidden in a dale, unknown to almost all who did not live there and uncharted on any maps. Due to the size of the inhabitants, the buildings were at most 10 feet (3 meters) tall at the chimney top. The locals spent much of their time in relaxed gardening pursuits, with extensive fields and orchards surrounding their homes.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The village lay about 5 miles (8 kilometers) from the Way of the Dragon where it exited the King's Forest , not far from Minroe in the foothills of the Storm Horns .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>A particularly extraordinary resident of Home was the gnome Ekhar Lorrent , who was periodically compelled to abandon his humble abode and travel abroad and solve murder mysteries.</p>
