<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cavanter bush produced edible swelling green cavanter buds around late Tarsakh . The buds were eaten by humanoids , as well as small brown birds of the forest, like the riskin . The buds could be eaten raw but were especially delectable when fried in butter . In terms of taste, they were similar to an olive or radish —crispy and fresh on the outside and soft, bready and chewy on the inside—while their texture was similar to that of a carrot .</p>
