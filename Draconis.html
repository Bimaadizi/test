<p>Draconis was a brown dragon and the son of Abazigal .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Curiously enough, Draconis seemed to be a brown dragon even though Abazigal was a blue . Like Abazigal, Draconis was a dragon capable of taking humanoid form. In fact, his alternative form was more fully human. He was a powerful mage and unarmed fighter and, as a dragon, used the troublesome technique of turning invisible in combat.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Draconis owned Grand Master Tzu Zan 's bracers, which were highly sought out by combatants around Toril .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In his human form, he was confronted by Gorion's Ward and the ward's companions. At first, he thought them to be more of the monks of Balthazar , who was the rival of his father. He thought they would have learned from last time, as their batch was disposed of. After he smelt the taint of Bhaal 's blood on the ward, the dragon mocked the ward's ambition.</p>
<p>Draconis was adamant that he would not let them see his father, a Bhaalspawn . After a fierce battle, he was killed by the ward, who took his severed head in order to pass into Abazigal's lair.</p>
