<p>The Market of Suzail , the capital of Cormyr , was a large, boisterous, and busy open-air plaza marketplace that dealt in a wide variety of goods, while its counterpart â€“ the Market Hall offered food and produce exclusively.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Market's dusty expanse stood east of the city's Field-Gates with Garth Street begging there and stretching north, eventually reaching Suzail's grand Promenade .</p>
<h3>Services</h3>
<p>Most of the plaza was an open space with some permanent stalls and tents dotting the area. All of the merchants loudly advertised their goods to the busy crowds. Some of the typical items found in the Market were apples , clothing, boots and shoe repair, leather goods, armor mending, and fletcher's goods. Small roasting stalls exuded alluring aromas of roasting meats, both common and exotic, and expensive exported fruit and vegetables from faraway lands attracted cooks from noble estates. Bulkier items were also available here, including furniture, and tools.</p>
<p>Days of fair weather were popular among vendors and shoppers who filled the plaza first thing in the morning.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , one of the numerous vendors who flooded the plaza with their goods and air with loud solicitations was Razor John who offered razor-point arrows . He lived atop his forge to the east of the Basin , not far from the Black Rat tavern. Despite dealing business from his workshop, Razor John often traveled to the Market to advertise his trade and offer samples of his craft.</p>
