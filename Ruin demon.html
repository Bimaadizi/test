<p>Ruin demons were massive swarms of demonic insects that acted together to form vaguely humanoid -shaped clouds.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The insects that made up a ruin demon all looked like black flies with an approximation of a human face.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>These creatures reproduced by laying masses of insectoid eggs within a corpse.</p>
<h3>Homelands</h3>
<p>Ruin demons were generally found in the Gaping Maw , the 88th layer of the Abyss . There they hovered over its blighted shores, stalking the dim borders of the Screaming Jungle to feast on whatever creatures they came across. The frequent storms on that layer controlled their population size, though occasionally their abyssal winds carried them to other layers.</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>Theses creatures could only speak Abyssal .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ruin demons first emerged in the Brine Flats of the Gaping Maw and that is where they largely remained native to in the years following their creation.</p>
<h2>Notable Ruin Demons</h2>
<p>A dream version of the sorceress Natasha , created by her sister Elena , brought two ruin demons out of the Plane of Dreams to act as her servants within the dancing hut of Baba Yaga . They were always on her person, disguised as a pair of chitin pauldrons.</p>
