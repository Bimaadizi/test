<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1297 DR , the eight brothers of the Cender family planted 200 acres (810,000 m²) of plum trees on the eastern edge of the city of Suzail . After infighting caused the downfall of the brothers, their plum trees were left to deteriorate and become home to thousands of bats , including the species known as sinisters .</p>
<p>In the mid–14 th century DR , Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue sold both pickled and spiced plums, as well as fruit cheeses (a type of preserve) and jams that were made from the fruit.</p>
