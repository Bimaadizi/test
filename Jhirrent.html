<p>Jhirrent , the Ninth City of the Sword , was one of the twelve major cities in the imperial heartlands of ancient Jhaamdath .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Ninth City was northeast of the capital Naarkolyth on the Bay of Jhaamdath , in the foothills between the Aphrunn Mountains and Orsraun Mountains . After its destruction, the ruins lay on the Selmal Basin in the Vilhon Reach .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jhirrent was founded in the −4850 DR , as the ninth of the realm's core cities.</p>
<p>In the Year of Overflowing Casks, −276 DR , Jhamdaath began a campaign of aggressively logging the Chondalwood and slaughtering many elves of Nikerymath . In return, the elves performed a grand High Magic ritual in −255 DR that caused a huge wave from the Inner Sea to surge across the imperial core of Jhaamdath and wash away its people and cities. The massive movement of water created the Vilhon Reach and sank Jhirrent like most of the other Cities of the Sword, and its psionic artifacts were buried in the sea floor.</p>
<p>The sunken cities of Jhaamdath were revealed after the Spellplague in 1385 DR by dropping sea levels, becoming the Vilhon Wilds . The situation was then returned to its previous state in 1486 DR by the Great Rain and Second Sundering that covered them in seawater once more.</p>
