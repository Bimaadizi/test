<p>Frulam Mondath was a member of the reformed Cult of the Dragon of Severin Silrajin , holding the rank of Wearer of the Purple.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Mondath considered Langdedrosa Cyanwrath her right-hand, and often kept the half-dragon at her side.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>She was the leader of the Cult army in the assault on Greenest , and Langdedrosa Cyanwrath usually followed her directives. At the Cult's camp near the city, Frulam deferred to the half-dragon Rezmir , who was her superior.</p>
<p>When adventurers raided the camp, Frulam fought them but was easily defeated and captured. She hesitantly told the adventurers what she knew about the Cult's plan to summon Tiamat , which was minimal.</p>
<p>Later, Frulam was held captive by the Harpers for trial.</p>
