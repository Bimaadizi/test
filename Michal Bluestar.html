<p>Michal initially came to Zakhara on a foreign trading ship. While sailing the waters of Suq Bay , the merchants were accosted by Almari and her pirates. Michal noticed the shoddy artistry on the pirate flag and, defiant to Almari's authority, yelled out that she was the "Dreaded Porpoise." Impressed with his bravery, Almari offered to spare Michal's life if he agreed to design a new flag for her. Michal agreed and became one of Almari's crewmembers since that time.</p>
