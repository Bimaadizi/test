<p>The Flame of Love Lutery was a cramped shop in Jester's Green that sold a wide variety of items for the romantically inclined.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>True to its name, the shop did sell lutes , but the main focus of its business were trinkets and other small items in high demand by the local soldiers for their distant loves. The shop provided goods such as pre-written poems and love notes, scented candles , magically-preserved flowers, miscellaneous keepsakes, bottles of wine , and lingerie . The shop also sold salacious broadsheets such as The Elf Maiden and the Unicorn , High Ladies in Love , and The Maiden Said Maybe for 1 sp apiece, as well as romantic (or pornographic) pictures that usually went for 6 sp each, but could go from 1 sp to 10 gp .</p>
