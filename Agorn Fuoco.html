<p>In 1492 DR , if Manshoon managed to obtain the Stone of Golorr , after the Xanathar's Thieves' Guild and some adventurers discovered the Stone's hideout devised by the dragonborn butcher Thrakkus , then the high-ranking Zhent Vevette was instructed to deliver the Stone to Agorn. She would manage to deliver it during a performance at the Trades Ward theater called the Brizzenbright . However, Agorn entrusted the Stone to his girlfriend Amath Sercent .</p>
