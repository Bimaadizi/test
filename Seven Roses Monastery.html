<h2>History</h2>
<p>After Hai Chi bashed his wife Shichi No Ken and murdered their child, Shichi's father took her to the Seven Roses Monastery, where she could recover and be hidden from Hai Chi's family's spies. While women were rarely permitted in a monastery, his money more than made up for it. Over time, the monks healed Shichi's injuries and helped her recover from her trauma. And they taught her strength. Shichi trained under the Master of the East Wind, learning martial arts and acquiring the mental discipline needed.</p>
<p>Then, after nearly a decade of hunting, Hai Chi's spies located Shichi and he led thirty of his liegemen in an assault on the monastery, seeking to murder his former wife and the monks who'd given her sanctuary. But while the junior monks were swiftly defeated by his warriors, the masters handily overcame them, though they left Hai Chi himself untouched, granting Shichi the right to face her abuser. They fought and she at last slew him.</p>
<p>In short order, Emperor Po 's soldiers arrived to investigate, but the monks delayed them—requiring the soldiers to seek the permission of the Grand Master of Flowers to enter the monastery—making time to collect Shichi's possessions and for her to escape. It was not necessary; they'd come to stop Hai Chi and arrest him for this crimes. They were even grateful: Shichi's slaying of him in battle saved them the need for a shameful trial and public execution.</p>
<p>Though Shichi was permitted to stay at the Seven Roses Monastery, she declined, asking instead to become a walking initiate. The Grand Master of Flowers granted this and even gifted her with enchanted weapons, a magical katana and a magical bow . Armed thus, she wandered the land as a champion of good.</p>
