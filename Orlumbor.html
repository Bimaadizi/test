<p>Orlumbor ( pronounced : / ɔːr ˈ l ʌ m b ɔːr / or-LUM-bore ) was a small rocky barren island city-state in the Sea of Swords .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Orlumbor's mainland-facing natural harbor was the main populated area of the island. It was built by being cut into the island's rocks in a similar fashion to the homes of its many shipwrights. The settlement's buildings were cave-like structures and complexes connected by a complex chain of tunnels and stair flights. The docks and harbors of Orlumbor seemingly were always filled with workers.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The settlement was located due west of the Trollbark Forest between Daggerford and Baldur's Gate and 300 miles south of the free city of Waterdeep, on the Sword Coast . Few people visited the city, in part because of its treacherous harbor.</p>
<p>Despite its size, the island nation was independent and influential, in part due to its skilled, in-demand shipwrights who specialized in salt-water vessels. .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Orlumbor was an unassuming island inhabited by goat -herders, fishers , and some of the most renowned and skilled shipwrights in all Faerûn . The island produced some of the best quality ocean-faring ships in all Northwest Faerûn , found in many places across the region. Many oceanic vessels of the north originated on Orlumbor, and most had been repaired on the island at least once. These ships were known for their sturdy hulls, and construction timeframes varied by the ordered ship's size. Small merchant vessels took two months to complete, large trade ships – six months, and a fearsome warship took four months or more to construct. All of the docks and warehouses of Orlumbor were privately owned by local entities, despite Amn 's attempts to gain control of the production through purchase or via becoming creditors. These efforts historically were unsuccessful, thwarted by local families, Amnian in-fighting, and certain Waterdhavian noble families that held interest in Orlumbor.</p>
<p>Orlumbor was closely allied with the city of Baldur's Gate, owing it much. It also retained its independence thanks to Waterdeep's patronage and protection.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Long before the 14 th century DR , Orlumbor was a wooded island, but it had been all logged by the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR . Throughout the years, Orlumbor engaged in conflicts with another island nation – Mintarn , before the Tyrant took hold. Orlumbor survived these conflicts through Waterdeep's aid.</p>
<p>The Year of the Amber Hulk, 310 DR was a tragic year. Orlumbor was home to a hin settlement called Marrduin , and in 310 DR, a creature from the Lower planes , a six-legged monstrosity named Gorathil , decimated the halflings.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Many Mists, 1282 DR , the skies over Orlumbor exploded in fireworks of a magical battle between the black dragon named Starlaurynguldar and a Magister of Mystra , Ohland Grethgar . The long and spectacular battle resulted in the mutual destruction of both parties.</p>
<p>In the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Orlumbor was besieged in a surprise naval attack by ships that flew the flags of Waterdeep. The island's leader at the time – Tulgar Wrighttson , believed that the island fell to a treacherous betrayal by a trusted ally, but with the help of the Heroes of Ascore , it was revealed that the Waterdhavian ships were, in reality, conniving pirates.</p>
<p>At one point, closer to the 14 th century, Orlumbor had conflicts with Baldur's Gate and the nation of Amn, but by the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR , Baldur's Gate became a close ally to Orlumbor.</p>
