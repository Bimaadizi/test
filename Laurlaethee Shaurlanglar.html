<h2>History</h2>
<p>On Kythorn 4 of 261 DR , Laurlaethee Shaurglangar got into a meeting with Elminster Aumar, where she poisoned him with srindym in the moonwine she served him. When he survived, she tried to slay him with spells, slowly realizing that he really was protected by Mystra. Her last attempt at slaying him involved a blood dragon spell, but Elminster reversed the spell, preventing her death. She was then rejuvenated by Mystra.</p>
