<p>The Council of Four , whose individual members were referred to as the Dukes in the mid–14 th and 15 th century DR , was the governing body of the city of Baldur's Gate consisting of four powerful individuals elected for life. The council was part of the Lords' Alliance , which included Waterdeep , Neverwinter , and Silverymoon , among others.</p>
<h2>Organisation</h2>
<p>In the 15 th century, Baldur's Gate was governed by the Council of Four, which consisted of dukes and was the highest governing body that decided on law and politics. One of the dukes, the Grand Duke, had the power to break deadlocks in the Council. Below them was the Parliament of Peers , which discussed future actions and made recommendations to the dukes on all matters.</p>
<p>One of the dukes is traditionally the highest ranking officer of the Flaming Fist .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The history of the council dates back to the earliest days of Baldur's Gate and the conflict between the rich farmers of the walled city and the sea-captains of the harbor who refused to pay for entering the gate that had been financed by their colleague Balduran . The captains overthrew the farmers and the four eldest among them were installed as rulers, jokingly calling themselves "dukes".</p>
<p>In the mid–15 th century DR, Grand Duke Valarken tried to seize power using lycanthrope mercenaries, but failed. After that, surviving Duke Dillard Portyr dissolved the council, which was replaced by the Baldurian Parliament for some time.</p>
<p>In 1492 DR , the Council of Four and the Parliament of Peers were dissolved after Lord Enver Gortash was named the first archduke of Baldur's Gate following a vote in the High Hall by the peers.</p>
