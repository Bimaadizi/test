Despite Qilué's protests that as one of the Seven Sisters she was close to Dove and she was not to be harmed, Ierembree and other priestesses took offense to the intrusion, with Ierembree herself attempting to slay Dove outright. In response, Dove employed some manner of magic to have a heart-to-heart contact with her, which both calmed her down and mollified her opinion of the interloper.</p>
