<p>Gorloun Hethel was a veteran member of the Purple Dragons in Suzail during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1479 DR , Hethel and four more Dragons acted as escorts for the War Wizard of Cormyr Ellard Gauntur in his pursuit of the renegade Rorskryn Mreldrake . They caught up to Rorskryn as he used a portal to Marsember , while in the shape of a woman; Ellard Gauntur figured out that it was Rorskryn transformed from a stain on her clothes, and they pursued through the portal. Then the evil vampire archmage Manshoon sent the death knight Targrael after them to hide Mreldrake's trail.</p>
<p>Targrael found Hethel at Ildool's Veil atop the King's Tower in Marsember; he was coming out, asking for Ellard Gauntur to come and see something, when he saw the man, just slain by the death knight. Hethel gave her a brief fight, but was overcome almost immediately.</p>
