<p>Cressaed Wood was a Cormyrian bard who wrote A Harper's Companion , a series of three songbooks.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Cressaed lived around 1200 DR, as a bard , but preferred music and teaching over adventuring. Once he had a name for himself, he founded a music and magic school in Arabel , Cormyr , and his work, A Harper's Companion , was his teaching tool for students. Cressaed preferred to teach smaller groups, and copied each volume by hand.</p>
<p>Upon graduation from his school, each student was presented with a copy of the first volume of A Harper's Companion , and the other two were presented to students who showed increasing magical and musical skill.</p>
<p>Cressaed was found dead in his bed, a victim of poison, and there were suspicions that he was killed because he was believed to be a Harper . No Harper officially stated whether Cressaed was himself a Harper or not.</p>
