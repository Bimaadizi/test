<p>Ghazrim was born to a wealthy family in Amn . In later life, he joined the Zhentarim and was appointed as their representative in the crucial garrison of Mantol-Derith.</p>
<p>Circa 1486 DR , he was the only bulwark against the chaos spreading in the trading post, with duergar and deep gnomes making war on each other and the drow ready to seize total control of the place. However, the drow representative Sirak Mazelor needed Ghazrim's approval of her plan in order to act.</p>

<p>Ghazrim had with Lorthuun , the leading beholder of the garrison, a relationship like that of a married couple, bickering and insulting each other but knowing both were loyal to the Black Network.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
