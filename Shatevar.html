Shatevar was forced to use his disintegrating eye beam to carve through rock and stone to reach Melegaunt Tanthul in the area around the Sharn Wall .</p>
<p>When Vala and her men engaged a band of Evereskan tomb guardians , Shatever proved a valuable ally to the humans, nullifying their magic with its antimagic eye beam and even killing the elven sentry Aragath . Shatevar was slain with a single slash of a darksword by one of the Vaasan warriors, its body left limp and lifeless upon the cavern floor.</p>
