<h2>History</h2>
<p>Joe worked in his apple orchard, located in the safest and tamest stretch of land along the Trade Way . His simple but content life lacked any rush and excitement of big cities such as Daggerford, with an occasional rumor that reached his small community on occasional from the city. When he met the Hero of Daggerford in 1372 DR , he shared his philosophy on boredom, that people were not cut out for it. He claimed that people needed to do things, and lack of that led to wars and such. He also stated that despite his wife's disapproval, he would gladly support his sons were they to ever pick a career in adventuring, just for them to avoid the mundanity and boredom. Josef himself, however, was too old for that lifestyle. In the end, Josef advised the Hero how to get to Fernd Krip 's watermill.</p>
