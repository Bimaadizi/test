<p>Maerlar was a city located in the country of Mulhorand during the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Maerlar sat at the crossroads of the Great South Road , Great East Road , and the Road to the Dawn in north Mulhorand.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The precept of Maerlar's main duty was to maintain guards at the crossroads and protect incoming trade. Vizier Rezim typically sent his underlings here to serve as precept after they had disappointed him in some way. The city lacked a precept in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , but someone was expected to be appointed relatively soon, in the next half-year or so, though Rezim might well wait until he had a suitable candidate to rid himself of.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Maerlar's location meant that most trade going overland to the capital city Skuld passed through its gates.</p>
