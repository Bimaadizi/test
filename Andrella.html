<p>Andrella was the head barmaid of the Beached Leviathan , one of the most popular taverns of Neverwinter in the late years of the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Andrella was usually described as a prim, proper lady.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As the head barmaid of the Beached Leviathan, Andrella managed the day-to-day affairs of the inn and tavern. Because of that, the other staff members referred to her as the "Mate" or the "First Mate", something that she accepted as a bittersweet joke. She was also very protective of Harrag , the Beached Leviathan's owner, trying to protect him from Dagult Neverember 's plots whenever possible.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point before 1479 DR , Andrella's husband was killed because some gambling debts, and she lost everything. Sometime later, she met Harrag, who, out of compassion, hired her to be a barmaid in the then recently opened Beached Leviathan. Over time, Andrella fell in love with Harrag, but never confessed her true feelings because of Harrag's "free spirit" personality.</p>
<p>In 1479 DR, a group of Ashmadai cultists summoned two devils and attacked the Beached Leviathan, mind-controlling some of the patrons present at the moment. Andrella was present during the fight, but luckily was saved by a group of adventurers .</p>
