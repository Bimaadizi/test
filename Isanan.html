<p>Isanan was a wizard from then city of Urmlaspyr in Sembia , who lived many years before the late 13 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Isanan was the third person to own a unique enchanted Myrkulyte belt â€“ the Belt of Bones . He purchased the belt from an unnamed grave robber who desecrated and looted the final resting place of the fierce warrior named Proud Keth , the belt's original master. The Belt of Bones served Isanan well for many years after that. When the wizard's career culminated in retirement, he sold the belt to a very grateful adventuring cleric of Myrkul named Ben-Karad , years before the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR .</p>
