<p>A mail coif , also known as a chain coif or simply a coif , was a padded chainmail hood that usually came either with or built into chainmail or some other form of mail-based armor .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The mail coif was snugly draped over the neck, shoulders, and head of the wearer, leaving only the face exposed. The protection it offered wasn't substantial, especially against impact weapons, and so it was typically worn beneath some form of helmet , such as the great helm worn by many knights .</p>
