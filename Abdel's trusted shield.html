<p>Abdel's trusted shield was a unique enchanted shield that was once wielded by Abdel Adrian , the Bhaalspawn hero of Baldur's Gate .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Abdel's trusted shield lacked decorative features, instead being a sturdy simple-looking shield. A note faded with time was attached to the shield. It read: "G, I've found the best defense against an arrow is to be the one behind the bow – but this shield also does the trick in a pinch. Yours, AA."</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The shield possessed a simple +2 defensive enchantment and was designed to be effective when bashing enemies with it, knocking them prone. Additionally, the shield held the protection from missiles spell that the wielder could cast once per day.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point, Abdel gave this shield to his friend Golbraith Stredivas , an adventurer who resided in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<p>During the Absolute crisis in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Golbraith may have granted the shield to the Absolute Adversaries if he was impressed by their courage in fighting against mind flayers .</p>
