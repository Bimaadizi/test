<p>A talisman of ultimate evil was a magic item that an evil priest could use to smite a goodly priest.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>In the hands of a foul-hearted priest, a talisman of ultimate evil could open a crack in the ground beneath the feet of a goodly priest, swallowing them forever and hurtling them to the very center of the earth. Unless the evil priest was of foulest heart and mind, the good priest would have a chance to resist the talisman's magic. These items contained six charges and could not be recharged.</p>
<p>Any priest not black of heart suffered great harm when touching a talisman of ultimate evil . Non-priests could touch the talisman without harm but could not wield its magic.</p>
