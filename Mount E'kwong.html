<p>Mount E'kwong was a mountain in the middle of the Po Yul Dzayul Range in central Tabot . not far from the Shou Lung border.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Described as grim and foreboding, its slopes were stark and jagged.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>Atop Mount E'kwong stood the Temple of Heaven's Heart, devoted to the Celestial Heart in Tabot's form of the Way of Enlightenment . It hosted an important religious ceremony and festival, and thousands of pilgrims tried to attend, but only a relative few were permitted to make the journey, as well as specially invited guests. By tradition, they went on foot, following a narrow, crowded road that wound some 60 miles (97 kilometers) up the mountain. It took days for them all to make the journey.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) , Tabot negotiated peace with Shou Lung and invited a delegation to the ceremony at the Temple of Heaven's Heart. The Dragon Lord Mei Lung elected to attend in person (though, as a dragon, it seems he was in disguise) with attendants and escorts. He watched the procession for two days, noting people of all ages, warriors, monks , priests, and servants, before meeting Pang , a monk scribe chosen to represent Pokarr Gompa , accompanied by five temple guards. They went up together, with Pang telling Mei Lung what he knew of his homeland.</p>
