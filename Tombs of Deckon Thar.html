<p>The Tombs of Deckon Thar , also known as the Tombs of the Chieftains in Gold , were seven cairns loaded with bandit treasure within the Nether Mountains .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The tombs were located on the southern slopes of the western Nether Mountains in a secret box canyon north of Silverymoon Pass .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Named for Deckon Thar , the first leader of the bandit kingdom known as the Chieftains in Gold , the tombs were legendary. For years, these raiders attacked merchants between Silverymoon and Sundabar and growing fabulously rich. Their their ill-gotten gains were hoarded in a great keep and in these tombs, where each of their first seven kings was buried in a lavish funeral. burying their leaders in dark caves filled with riches. After their nation was wiped out by orcs , only the Tombs remained unplundered.</p>
<p>At some point prior to the mid–14 th century DR , the great wight Vinjarek the Mound King arose in the Tombs. He had apparently not been interred there originally, and so claimed rulership over them along with the treasures of the Chieftains. His rule continued into the late 15 th century DR, by which time he had become plaguechanged and was a menace to nearby Luruar .</p>
<p>When one of the seven barrows was raided by adventurers from Silverymoon circa the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , every member of their party was slain on their journey home. Each body was discovered with its loot and equipment missing, its limbs dismembered, and with the words "Disturb not the Mound King" carved into the flesh.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>As of the mid–14 th century DR , the entombed had risen as wights under the icy rule of Vinjarak the Mound King .</p>
