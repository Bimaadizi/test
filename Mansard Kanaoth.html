<p>Mansard Kanaoth was a Vindicator of the Warlock Knights of Vaasa and the only half-orc member of the ruling Ironfell Council in the late 15 th century DR . His holdings included both Palischuk and the newly restored Castle Perilous .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Mansard claimed to be descended from the Witch-King Zhengyi , and secretly adopted the title of Witch-King for himself. After Castle Perilous mysteriously rejuvenated in the Year of the Purloined Statue, 1477 DR , he began amassing troops in secret nearby in preparation to usurp control of Vaasa from his fellow Ironfell Councilors.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Mansard was known as an influential member of the Ironfell Council. Among his vassals and allies, he was vocal in his desire to rule Vaasa and of his opposition to the Voice of Telos . His main philosophical argument was that the Voice of Telos was too concerned with venerating Telos when the Warlock Knights ought to have simply been using the primordial as a tool. He was more cautious and diplomatic when speaking with Warlock Knights not involved with his plot, but he still actively sought to build support for his claim to rule.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As a Knight-Vindicator, Mansard was adept with both weapons and arcane magic, had access to ironfell equipment, and could channel the radiant powers of Telos. He also practiced Zhengyian blood magic , which allowed him to tap into traces of Zhengyi's dark power in his blood. While he undoubtedly used this to support his claim of being descended from the Witch-King, it was also possible for these dark powers to manifest in the descendants of individuals who merely came into contact with one of Zhengyi's evil relics .</p>
