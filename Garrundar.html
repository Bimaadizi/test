<p>Garrundar the Vile was an old black dragon who made his home in the Pirate's Skyhold north of Neverwinter .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At one time, the sky pirates of Bartholomew Blackdagger tried to capture Garrundar but they failed spectacularly and the black dragon pursued them back to their hideout. Garrundar took control of the lizardfolk that lived there and he weaved a powerful spell that cursed the pirates into undeath and bound them. In the late 15 th century DR , Company Yargo , needing a base and more sky ships, sent an adventurer to confront the dragon. The adventurer fought and killed him.</p>
