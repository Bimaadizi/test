<p>The Old Troll's Foot was a very rustic and druidic restaurant in the village of Kirinwood in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The restaurant as a whole resembled something of a forest glade and its rooms, separated by walls and ceilings of hung bark and vines, to be like their own grottos. The rooms were all dimly lit, with illumination provided by a combination of driftglobes and ambulatory, bioluminescent mushrooms .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Much of the Old Troll's Foot menu was dominated by agricultural vegetable dishes, such as a cold potato soup , a spicy bean broth of asparagus & artichokes , fiddlehead butter , simple bread , and gooey-sweet berry crumble tarts made from blueberries and raspberries . The few meat options on the menu were bacon and wild wood sausage , both of which were sourced from the Kirinwood market and fiercly seasoned with herbs , as well as roasted boar . One usually had to bring in boar meat from elsewhere to get this prepared, as the proprietor was picky about drawing from Kirinwood's small boar population.</p>
<p>In terms of beverages, they offered firewine , earthworm-and-bark tea , and glowfire . The firewine had a notably spicy kick to it, as the restaurant allowed their reserves to age for a decade before opening the kegs .</p>
<p>The signature dish of the Old Troll's Foot was the Troll's foot , an extravagant mixture of meat and vegetable that cost a steep 5 gold pieces per serving.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime between 1366 - 1367 DR , the famed traveling writer Volothamp Geddarm visited the Old Troll's Foot when writing the travelogue Volo's Guide to Cormyr and came way with the opinion that it was well worth a visit. Of his experience he found the seasoning of the bacon and sausage too strong to his liking, the fiddlehead butter surprisingly good, the fresh bread it offered to be not that bad, and most notably urged his readers that the signature Troll's foot was a mouth-watering dish well worth its asking price.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>This establishment was owned and operated by Orbrar , one of the senior members of Kirinwood's resident druidic circle the Talkers to the Trees .</p>
