<p>Calathalureenteir was a large forest stream that ran across the Weldaths southeastern part.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Calathalureenteir began close to the Forest of Tethyr's edge and flowed northwest, past the Swanmay's Glade and pouring into the Nebulae Pool â€“ a body of water north of the elven tree city of Suldanessellar .</p>
<p>Calathalureenteir's namesake was Calathalureene , a human sorceress from the ages long past who lived along the stream's shores and was an ally to Weldath's elves. Those traders who visited the Swanmay's Glade in order to do business with Suldanessellar, often camped along the stream, away from the elven tree city, allowing the forest dwellers to approach the visitors.</p>
