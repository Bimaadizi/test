<p>A dagger of doomwarding was a +1 dagger that allowed the wielder to re-attempt any action they took. Upon enchantment , the dagger was imbued with seven charges that could be spent at-will by the wielder. When done, this person could make a free attack, re-attempt to protect themself from a spell effect, or retry any feat of strength, or the like. Essentially, the dagger protected its wielder from an act of failure by granting them another shot.</p>
<p>Unlike most other magical items, these daggers could not be recharged. After all seven charges were spent, they became regular +1 daggers .</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Among the items needed to craft a dagger of doomwarding was powdered alicorn horn, or even better, contact with a living unicorn 's horn upon the blade.</p>
