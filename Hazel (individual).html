<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Hazel and her apprentices were sent to the Blacklake District to study the sludge that had become so prevalent in and around the Blacklake , as it had developed strange and worrying properties. She maintained a small, mobile laboratory and campsite defended by members of the Neverwinter Guard against sludge-covered zombies and members of the Nashers and Dead Rats . Due to the risk, she hired an adventurer to collect samples of certain kinds of sludge or in certain locations. At one point her research was disrupted when Nashers stole her supplies, thinking they were potions , and also needed these retrieved. Finally, she could test whether the sludge was animal, vegetable, mineral, or undead , or if it was a hibernating black pudding .</p>
<p>Whatever it was, she got her answer when Therzt , a self-proclaimed Chosen of Ghaunadaur , summoned sludge-covered zombies from out of Blacklake to attack the waterfront. Hazel led the defense while Piniwin and Penny sought aid from adventurers; aided by her alchemist's fire , they defeated Therzt and the undead.</p>
<p>Afterward, Hazel went to Ebon Downs, where she paid adventurers to collect certain mushrooms and slivers of the Deathknell Shard crystal. It was safer there.</p>
