<p>Martial Catechism was a Sharran text underlining three main battle proficiencies of the church's agents, penned in or before the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>In the scroll, 'Strengthening of the Sword Arm' was the teaching that dictated the Sharrans were to work on melee combat drills for two hours daily, changing the weapon and the opponent after each consecutive round. During such exercises, wounds were permitted, and the church members prided themselves on the scars they earned. 'Honing of the Archer's Eye' was the second drill; it took two hours per day, teaching Sharrans to shoot at still, moving, and later even live targets. 'Hardening of the Poisoner's Heart' covered the theory of poison -making and was taught for another two hours per day. Each of the cloister students was dosed with small amounts of various poisons to develop tolerance.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a copy of Martial Catechism was found within the Cloister of Sombre Embrace , a secret Sharran sect underneath the Lower City of Baldur's Gate and available from the House of Grief above it.</p>
