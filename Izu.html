<p>Izu was a blind master smith from the Silver Marches who worked for the Harpers until his dying breath, sometime before 1373 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After spending years forging enchanted weapons and armor for his Harper allies, Izu died after a brutal winter that ravaged the region. Only after his death was the smith's affiliation with the Harpers discovered by his family. The smith's heirs gifted his prized possession – Izu's hammer of fabrication , to a young Harper agent Izu was especially fond of.</p>
