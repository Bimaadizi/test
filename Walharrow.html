<p>Captain Walharrow was a minotaur pirate and inmate of Grimshackle Jail in Phlan .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Walharrow was a feared pirate captain. At one point, however, he was captured and jailed at Grimshackle Jail.</p>
<p>In 1489 DR , the corrupt jailer Iorg Brokenjaw , in order to free Rathene Fel , let Walharrow break free to use him as diversion. The minotaur pirate rampaged through the jail until an adventuring party there to interrogate Rathene confronted and defeated him.</p>
<p>Years later, during the events of the death curse , Walharrow was restored to life by the infernal pirate Idrianne Smoke and her patrons within the Nine Hells . When Captain Smoke's forces attacked Port Nyanzaru , Walharrow was sent to seize control of the Thundering Lizard inn, causing much bloodshed in the process. This prompted the merchant prince Ekene-Afa to send adventurers to slay him once more.</p>
