<p>Landwyrms were a type of lesser, wingless dragon, each species of which was near-perfectly adapted to its environment.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Landwyrms were large, wingless dragons. Their appearance varied greatly between species.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Landwyrms were strong-willed and had independent natures.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like other dragons, landwyrms emanated a fear-inducing aura.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Although all landwyrm species had different ways of fighting, they all tended to favor stealth and surprise. Additionally, they saw nothing wrong with fleeing a battle only to return later. They were skilled trackers.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>All landwyrms were specific to different environments, to which they were extremely well-adapted. They possessed great knowledge about their environments and were known to share this knowledge if approached peacefully.</p>
<p>Landwyrms were among the creatures effected by the Dracorage , and would form flights along with wyverns , chromatic dragons , and elemental drakes , that destroyed everything they came across.</p>
<p>There were at least nine species of landwyrms, each of them not-so-creatively named after the environment which they inhabited. Known species of landwyrms included the desert landwyrm , forest landwyrm , hill landwyrm , jungle landwyrm , mountain landwyrm , plains landwyrm , swamp landwyrm , tundra landwyrm , and Underdark landwyrm .</p>
