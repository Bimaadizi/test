<h2>History</h2>
<p>Filfaeril was born Filfaeril Selazair on Mirtul 4, 1311 DR , the last member of House Selazair , a minor noble Cormyrean family. Her father was none other than Elminster , the famous sage of Shadowdale . Fee was a small child who was especially intelligent for her age, one that would be considered an "old soul". In her youth, Fee was personally tutored in numerous disciplines, including riding, martial combat, military tactics, and strategic gaming.</p>
<p>For a time she ran the family's beer business, while also conducting business with the Harpers. It was during that time that she first attracted the attention of Azoun. He knew early in their courtship that Filfaeril was the life partner he had sought for some time.</p>
<p>Although Filfaeril bore Azoun a son, Foril Obarskyr on Mirtul 1 , 1332 DR , the prince was assassinated by the Fire Knives on Uktar 11 , 1334 DR . This was an event that the Queen never fully recovered from.</p>
<p>When Azoun was brought near death by the abraxus incident in 1369 DR , it was rumored that Filfaeril was so stricken with grief that she was taken away to the Spires of the Morning in Eveningstar . This was not true, as she had withdrawn to the Hidden Chambers in the royal palace in Suzail . A flight of flying daggers and helmed horrors was unleashed into the private apartment in Eveningstar where the queen was supposed to be staying, killing four Purple Dragon knights and under priests guarding the war wizardess who was posing as the queen.</p>
<p>Filfaeril assumed the appearance of merchant's wife Aglarra Galdekund in order to hide in Waterdeep during the abraxus affair . The change in mannerisms and voice was blamed on an illness, that the couple had to travel to Iritue's Firesprings in southern Amn in order to address. Filfaeril's appearance at that time was changed to become short and masculine, with a pot belly and a large, pimpled chin.</p>
<p>During the rule of her daughter, Alusair the Steel Regent, Queen Fee remained in court and offered her skills as a diplomat to best aide the Forest Kingdom. Queen Filfaeril remained the 'true' ruler of Cormyr for a period of five years, from 1379 to 1384 DR , ending with the birth of her grandson, Azoun Obarskyr V . Filfaeril enjoyed complete and well-deserved authority in court as monarch, while Alusair as regent was seen as the "hero" among of the realm.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The dark mage Manshoon once commissioned a lewd chapbook entitled Filfaeril Bound and Willing in an attempt to publicly shame and discredit Queen Fee's reputation.</p>
