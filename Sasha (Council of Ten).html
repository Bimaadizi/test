<p>Sasha was a Council Clerk and, later, the youngest Councilmember of the Council of Ten from the city of Phlan in the mid 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of the Morningstar, 1350 DR , Sasha joined the Council of Ten as its youngest member in recognition of her prolific successes in dealing with the Silver Blades that enriched Phlan's coffers, as well as aiding in purging the city of corruption a decade prior. Just before the city of Phlan and other settlements on the shores of the Moonsea were spirited away by joined forces of the evil deity Bane , Councilmember Sasha left the city to inspect Phlan's outpost in the neighboring land of Thar . She was accompanied by bodyguards, yet they could not protect the young Councilwoman from falling victim to the new master of Taydome's Keep – mage Kimarr .</p>
<p>Kimarr was a one-time ally of Phlan but revealed himself as a traitor and sought to use Sasha as a bargaining chip allying with Bane's forces. He found a way to magically enslave ogres and giants of Taydome's Keep. His forces captured Sasha, Bostell – one of her bodyguards, and a fellow mage and ally of Phlan – Quil . Subsequently, Sasha was freed by the heroes of Phlan, while Kimarr was slain after he transformed himself into a fierce blue dragon .</p>
