<p>Glinda Scatterstar was the master of the Mage's Guild of Hillsfar and secretly an active rebel against Lord Maalthiir in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Glinda saw Maalthiir as a ruining influence in her city and she changed the objective of the Guild to actively remove him from power.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>In order to advance her plan, although very slowly, Glinda tried to expand the Mage's Guild as much as possible, by not only training new wizards but also molding the minds of their pupils against Maalthiir. She also secretly smuggled into the city a number of elves and half-elves to reinforce her guild. Glinda waited for the inevitable defeat of the Red Plumes by the Zhentarim before she would act.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1372 DR Glinda disappeared and her position was taken by her "sister" Girella Scatterstar (in truth a doppelganger ).</p>
