<p>The Forlorn Cliffs was a once well-traveled Middledark portal nexus that connected various parts of Underdark .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Forlorn Cliffs were located in a group of massive caverns and allowed the travelers to traverse them via many winding cliff pathways illuminated by luminescent fungi and enchanted brazers of continual faerie fire leftover from the region glory days. The bottom of the deep caverns was littered with sharp rock formations and giant Underdark mushrooms . The pathways intertwined and intercepted and occasionally led to bigger naturally-formed rock platforms. The entire area was littered with portals and gate s that were used in the past to quicken the underground travel. In late 15 th century DR, many of the portals were corrupted, destroyed, or forgotten. Cave moss grew in this region in abundance.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>One of the many portals of the Forlorn Cliffs led to the ancient Rhylfang's Lair in the Evermoors .</p>
<p>Another portal of note was hidden behind a complex rune-lock and eventually led to Gracklstugh .</p>
