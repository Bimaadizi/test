<p>Vampyres , sometimes referred to as fireghosts , were a rare strain of vampirism found in Faer√ªn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Due to their unique abilities, a vampyre was liable to have ash-covered clothing or burnt hair.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Vampyres were largely the same as the most common strain of vampirism, including having the abilities to shapechange into a large bat , assume a gaseous form at will, cling to and climb up walls , and charm people with a gaze. They most noticeably differed from the common vampire in that their hands were always full of fire , as if produce flame had been cast, though unlike the spell their possessions were liable to combust. This forced vampyres to utilize their bat form whenever they wanted to move or carry things without the threat of igniting them. Vampyres also differed in that they could transfer some of their life energy to other undead or living creatures by means of breath, usually in the form of a kiss, effectively healing or revitalizing them.</p>
<p>Only weaponry bearing a +1 or greater enchantment could harm vampyres. In addition to the traditional vampiric immunities to poison , charm spells, hold spells, and sleep spells, vampyres were impervious to harm from fire and took only half as much harm from cold- or electrical-based magic. Like the most common strain of vampirism, they could be harmed with holy water and holy symbols .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>When engaging prey, a vampyre usually sought to set their clothes alight and then attack as they scrambled to put out the flames, engage in healing, or protect precious combustible items.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , a Waterdhavian merchant-turned-vampyre by the name of Spadreera Omarkhont was lairing within the Sargauth Level of Undermountain .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>A vampyre typically laired within structures made of stone that had been burnt bare.</p>
