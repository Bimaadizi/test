<p>A shikomi-zue ( pronounced : / ʃ i k oʊ m i z uː ɛ / shee-koh-mee-zoo-eh ) was a weapon used in Kara-Tur , primarily by ninjas and sohei .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>At first glance, a shikomi-zue appeared as a regular staff. However, a spring-loaded spear head was hidden within. The spear head sprung forth by either pressing a button or twisting the shaft. Other weapons could be concealed with the staff, such as chains , hooks, or eggshell grenades . A shikomi-zue was made from either bamboo or wood and was about 6 ft (1.8 m) in length. Assembling the weapon took about a week.</p>
