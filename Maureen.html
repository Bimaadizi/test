<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the time the Wailing Death ravaged Neverwinter in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Maureen's home district, Peninsula, was not only hit by the plague, but also by a riot in the district's prison, spilling its inmates out into the streets. Saulter managed to evacuate from the district alongside his wife Maureen, before it was quarantined off by the Neverwintran militia but not before he lost his family to the plague. Now homeless, Maureen had to sleep on city streets by a beggars' campfire in the City Core , where she mourned the loss of her home and lamented the city guard being unable or unwilling to help with retaking the district.</p>
