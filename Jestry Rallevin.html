<p>Jestry Rallevin was a skilled zealot of Asmodeus in the service of Sylora Salm .</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>He had large shoulders, dark hair and brooding dark eyes.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He served Lady Sylora first as an adviser and later as her champion.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Little was known about Jestry's past, but he once lived near a lake with his twin sisters and parents, the latter of which was a fisherman.</p>
<p>Jestry was fearless in combat and possessed a hunger for a battle just like the rest of the zealots of Asmodeus.</p>
<p>After his battle prowess was revealed to Sylora after the battle of Gauntlgrym he was elevated to fill in as her champion after the desertion of Dahlia Sin'felle . Jestry was secretly in love with Sylora but she denied him stating the "Truth that they know, that which makes them strong": "There is no love, only lust." Then his mistress forced him to deny his love for her and claim that he only wanted to possess her.</p>
<h2>Transformation</h2>
<p>Lady Sylora used her contact with the Sovereignty Ambassador to turn Jestry into an even deadlier champion. He went through a ritual created by the Ambassador where he was covered in hot oil with the aboleth in his mind not letting him feel the pain in a state of emptiness. Boiled umber hulk hide from five umber hulks was put on top of his skin where it set and hardened.</p>
<p>As the ritial neared its end all but Jestry's eyes, nostrils, ears and mouth was covered in umber hulk hide, the aboleth focused on Jestry to make him survive the pain that was inflicted to him during the ritual. Jestry's screams were deafening and his eyes were more red than white when he was released. Valindra asked him who he was after the ritual and he responded with: "Jestry, Slave of Asmodeus, Champion of Sylora Salm."</p>
