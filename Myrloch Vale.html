<p>Myrloch Vale was a large vale located in the central part of the island of Gwynneth in the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Myrloch Vale was a magical and unspoiled wilderness that was considered sacred to the Earthmother . It was a place revered by the Ffolk and feared by the Northlanders of Gwynneth.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The vale was a lush valley nestled between the Black Mountains to the north, the Cambro Mountains to the east, and the Highlands to the south. It was dominated by the shining waters of the Myrloch lake to the south.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Myrloch Vale was home to a number of druids who venerated the Earthmother at the vale's many mooonwells . These druids were perhaps the only humans who could travel the Vale without fear.</p>
<p>The Vale was home to fey , including centaurs , pixies , sprites , and elves , namely the Llewyrr . Faerie dragons were numerous in the vale and buzzed about like bees among the wild flowers and woods.</p>
<p>The Vale became the heartland of the fey kingdom of Sarifal . At this time, non-fey ventured there only at their own peril.</p>
