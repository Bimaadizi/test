<p>An acid blob was a rare subterranean ooze that was known to dwell in Zakhara .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Acid blobs were deadly green oozes that bounced across the ground, rather than stick to ceilings or walls. Some of these blobs were darker in color, but seemed to be much rarer.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>These unintelligent blobs of acid attacked their opponents with their bodies, where the acid quickly burned flesh. The acid, however, was not long-lasting. All ordinary metal objects had a chance to become weakened, or even break. Magic items were not affected by the blob's acid.</p>
<p>On their own or in a pair, acid blobs were not so difficult to deal with. However, a pack of eight or so acid blobs posed a threat to adventurers.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Acid blobs were formed by separating off of larger acid blobs. Smaller blobs could also separate to form larger, more powerful blobs.</p>
<p>Although they preferred to live underground, as most oozes and slimes did, they were often found above ground, looking for meals. Although they were omnivorous, the acid blobs much preferred living prey. To make this easier, they often formed packs of up to eight blobs to hunt down the next feast.</p>
