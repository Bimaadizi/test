<p>Noolgaloop was a kuo-toa high priest in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The kuo-toa led by Noolgaloop were lured by Halaster to an island on a grotto inside the Twisted Caverns , where an otyugh had lived until the Mad Mage petrified it. As planned by Halaster, the kuo-toa started to worship the petrified otyugh, which Noolgaloop identified as a god called Bulba-Slopp .</p>
<p>In 1492 DR , the aboleth Illuun arrived in the area and started to mentally enslave the local kuo-toa, gaining control of the grotto. Seeing Bulba-Slopp was ineffective against the aboleth, Noolgaloop declared the petrified otyugh not worthy of worship any more and decided to create a new god to protect them.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Noolgaloop led the kuo-toa community inside the Twisted Caverns and was at war with the invading aboleth and its thralls. Noolgaloop was busy trying to erect the idol of the new god he had devised, Klaabu , using some carcasses gathered by his minions and planning to reclaim the kuo-toa holy shrine from the control of the aboleth.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Noolgaloop truly believed he could create a god to protect his people.</p>
