<p>The Surlpar family was one of the twenty families that made up the hereditary council of lords (known as the Onsruur ) in Kh么ltar , south Faer没n , circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Surlpars did not have any striking distinguishing features, but their hair was always blond, platinum blond, or white. Their wealth allowed them to pursue pleasure and self-gratification, but they bickered among themselves, forming cliques within the family. Because they were not unified in vision and ambition, their reputation was severely tarnished, and by 1372 DR they were a dim reflection of their former glory in the Onsruur, hated by many.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Surlpars had significant property holdings and rented most of them out. In addition to being landlords, they were also in the moneylending business, taking advantage of those with a need for capital or to cover a shortfall.</p>
<p>The rumors about breeding monsters in the basement of their mansion were true. They used them as guardians of treasure, sport hunting, and sold them to interested parties.</p>
