<h2>History</h2>
<p>After Malabog formed an alliance with the lich Valindra Shadowmantle , circa the Faer√ªnian Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , he began a campaign of destruction and scourge against every living being within the Feywild. He inflicted the creatures and the plants of the forest with blight and disease, corrupting the very soil of the earth within the plane.</p>
<p>In response, the Iliyanbruen elves of New Sharandar launched a campaign against the corruptive influence of Malabog and the dark fey. Under the leadership of Pelendethas Everstride , they worked with adventurers to slay the evil creatures that overran the forest, destroyed and then healed the corrupted plants that took root in its earth, and nurtured new life by planting seedlings that had been enchanted by magic .</p>
<p>Pelendethas uncovered the whereabouts of a particularly harmful fomorian champion that was known as the Scion of Corruption , and enlisted the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge to defeat the twisted giant.</p>
