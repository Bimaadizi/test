<p>The Feather Falls was a waterfall on the eastern edge of Featherdale , a natural landmark that indicated the border between that dale and Scardale . It carried the rushing water from the River Ashaba down into the deep gorge known as the the Scar .</p>
<p>There were much speculation circulating in Featherdale about what was behind this cascade of water, hiding in the sheer face of the cliff. There were a secret collection of grottoes known as the Temple Beneath the Falls . Some spoke of this fabled landmark as a tale to share with children, while others regarded it as a mere joke. Yet other rumors told of an ancient temple dedicated to an evil deity, and a story of Dalesmen a century earlier who attempted to drive its cultists from the lair.</p>
