<p>The Michell Academy was a short-lived wizardly school located near the town of Berdusk in the Sunset Vale sometime before the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The members of the Academy wore enchanted mage robes on crimson, created to empower the academics's spellcasting abilities. One notable master's robe worn by the professor of alchemy survived well into the late 14 th century DR.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Michell Academy was destroyed many years before the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR after antagonizing the local temple dedicated to Loviatar , the Patroness of Torturers. The temple's mistresses led an hour-long battle that ended the Academy. However, despite the battle's briefness, the Loviatans spent days torturing the members of the Michell Academy, according to historians. Jamal Briars , the professor of alchemy, received a torture that was a pun on his name. The temple's elementals dragged Jamal across thorny briers until he perished from blood loss.</p>
