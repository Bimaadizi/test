<p>During the fateful fall of Myth Drannor in the Weeping War ( 711 – 714 DR ), Victoria led a band of N'Vaelahr into the depths of the Elven Catacombs against one of the Dark Generals of the Army of Darkness , the creature known as Drenofiend . However, Victoria and her squad were slaughtered, caught unaware by Greyanna , the youngest daughter of Matron Mother Faeurdyn of the drow House Freth , who'd allied themselves with the Army of Darkness against the City of Song.</p>
<p>In 1369 DR , Victoria's enchanted gear and her diary were looted from the dead by the returned drow of House Freth, who had allied with the enemies of Myth Drannor once again, this time the Cult of the Dragon . Victoria's gear was readied for transport into the Underdark by the marauding drow. However, the drow operations were disbanded by the Veiled Ones of Phlan , who once heard Victoria's ghostly voice asking them to avenge her death and slay Greyanna Freth.</p>
