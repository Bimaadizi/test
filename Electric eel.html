<p>Electric eels were a rarely-sighted species of eel in Faerûn that possessed the unique ability to discharge a field of electricity. Electric eels endemic to saltwater and ocean environments were sometimes called marine eels .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Electric eels had long scaleless bodies, with mouths devoid of teeth, and two short pectoral fins. They also had a single pelvic fin that stretched across most of the length of their stomach. This pelvic fin enabled the eels to quickly propel themselves in any direction, even backwards. Their bodies were largely a dull gray, though often displayed either green or red coloration on both their stomach and throat.</p>
<p>However, the body length of a fresh water and marine electric differed significantly. Electric eels that inhabited freshwater environments typically grew to an average length of 9 feet (2.7 meters). The marine variety were known to grown to lengths of around 20​ to ​40 feet (6.1​ to ​12 meters).</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>Electric eel possessed an inherent immunity any form of damage from electicity.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Like most species of eel, an electric eel were not aggressive creatures and would only attack if disturbed or threatened.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>When either hunting or needing to protect itself, an electric eel was capable of discharging a jolt of electricity out to radius of 15 feet (4.6 meters). This would either stun or outright kill most nearby creatures. If done for the purpose of self-defense, an electric eel would typically try to flee from their opponent afterwards in order to recover from the discharge.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>In the late-14 th century DR , rumors circulated claiming that kuo-toa were trying to capture and domesticate electric eels to guard their lairs.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Outside of when it came time for them to breed, electric eels spent most of their life solitarily. However, often times releasing a jolt of electricity would attract nearby electric eels, hopeful that they can take part in eating a killed creature.</p>
<h3>Diets</h3>
<p>Electric eels were a carnivorous species. They typically feasted upon small fish and frogs , swallowing them whole as they lacked teeth.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Electric eels were known to inhabit shallow bodies of both fresh water and salt water, commonly at depths of 30‒150 ft (9.1‒46 m). Some particular bodies of water that the fresh water variety were known to inhabit were the Lake of Dragons and tropical areas of the Sea of Fallen Stars .</p>
<p>Beyond the Prime Material plane , electric eels could be found in the Para-Elemental Plane of Ooze .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Though very difficult to train, some aquatic rangers were known to have them as animal companions .</p>
<h3>Usages</h3>
<p>Several crushed electric eels could mixed with the blood of a blue dragon in a broth to enchant its tooth .</p>
<h3>Summoning</h3>
<p>An electric eel could be summoned in fresh water with the summon monster II spell, while a giant electric eel could be summoned in fresh water with the summon monster V spell. With the summon monster VI spell a mighty marine eel could be summoned in any type of watery environment, with those who specialized in sea magic able to summon between 1 and 3 with that same spell.</p>
