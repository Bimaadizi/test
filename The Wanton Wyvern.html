<p>The Wanton Wyvern was an inn near the Hullack Forest in the East Reaches of Cormyr during the mid–14 th century DR . It was considered a typical such establishment for the environment.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>A countryside inn, it lay just outside the western edge of the Hullack Forest, near the east bank of the Immerflow . It was close to the East Way , which traveled through the forest west towards Arabel , and could be reached via the Thunder Trail . The ruins of the ancient castle of Tethgard stood in the forest of the southeast.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The inn was protected by a palisade.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The construction was sprawling. The rooms were simple, but warm and clean. The galleries had low ceilings.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Just inside the doors lay a lobby, on which a stair led up to a landing. Another stair from the landing led to a gallery with rooms.</p>
<p>The inside of the tavern was dusty and dark. The rooms were simple, but warm and clean. There were a number of ragged and faded tapestries hanging from the walls, which had once been spoils of battle. The tavern's indoor walls were clad in fine wooden panels.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Besides food, the place had the amenities for a bath.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The tavern was protected by a tall fence and gate. A shield hanging by the gate labeled "Strike to enter" was used by travelers to signal to the staff. Inside, a number of loaded crossbows were kept, hanging ready behind the bar.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mirt suggested heading for The Wanton Wyvern to Shandril Shessair after joining her at Tethgard during her journey from the Dalelands to Silverymoon in 1357 DR . On exiting Hullack Forest, they arrived at The Wanton Wyvern within the night. They met Baergasra , a friend of Mirt's, in passing. They also met Thomd , the innkeeper. While inside, Shandril briefly dozed off; when she woke up, Osber , a local Zhentarim fighter, attempted to capture her. During the fight, Narm Tamaraith , Shandril's husband, was poisoned. Mirt called upon Baergasra's help, and Thomd was told to draw her a bath.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Osber was a regular at the tavern. Baergasra, disguised as a leprous beggar, spent two years at the gate to spy on tavern-goers. Thomd was an innkeeper for at least that long.</p>
