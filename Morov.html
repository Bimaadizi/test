<p>Morov was one of the city provinces of Damara , along with one of its smaller baronies, as of the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Morov was found in the southern region of Damara, in what was considered nation's most fertile lands. It was situated along with the provinces of Polten and Ostel around Lake Mogador , a grand lake that was connected numerous rivers and shipping lanes that ran through the nation.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>As of the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , Morov was ruled over by the Damaran house of Banacath .</p>
<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>Morov's bountiful natural resources led to it becoming one of the wealthiest, and thus more stable of Damara's provinces during chaotic years of power struggles and war.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>During the Bloodstone Wars , Morov's fighting force was incorporated into the larger "army of the minor baronies", that boasted 1400 infantry soldiers, 600 mounted combatants, 260 archers , a score of chariots , and a trio of powerful wizards .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the Witch-King Zhengyi took over Damara, after the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , the lich installed Dimian Ree as Morov's new baron to consolidate power, and designated the independent city of Heliogabalus as its capital. When the Bloodstone Wars broke out that same year, Morov founded an alliance with the neighboring regions of Ostel and Polten. Baron Ree's inept leadership during the conflict led to many needless casualties, and the whole of its forces being kept within their borders. Over a thousand of Morov's soldiers deserted the army after their defeat by the forces of Gareth Dragonsbane at Warrenswood and found new homes in Bloodstone and Brandiar along the Galena Mountains .</p>
<p>The remaining allied army of Morov, Ostel, and Polten fought together once again to retain their "independence" against the army of Bloodstone one last time, following conflicts in Arcata and Carmathan . Upon their defeat, each of the three minor duchies swore allegiance to Bloodstone and its ruler, Gareth Dragonsbane.</p>
