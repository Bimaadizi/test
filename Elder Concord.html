<p>An Elder Concord was a ruling body in illithid society made up of individual Creed representatives.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The members of Elder Concords were Creedmasters, each who represented their Creed.</p>
<p>Each Elder Concord in a society was tasked with rulership responsibilities. However, the society's elder brain could propose its own plans and even decide the action taken by the Elder Concord, should they be undecided.</p>
<p>Elder Concords were responsible for electing officials in illithid community, such as quastors (finance and trade officials), vigileators (security officials), and aedileators (general officials).</p>
<p>When a circumstance required the attention of more than one mind flayer society, the individual Elder Concords would come together as a Grand Elder Concord. The Grand Elder Concord was a temporary body, and would be dissolved after the affairs were dealt with.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>For meetings, Elder Concords gathered around a platform that surrounded the society's elder brain.</p>
