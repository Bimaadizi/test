<p>The Black Horn Regiment was a yugoloth mercenary company led by the ultroloth Inthracis . They were based in Corpsehaven within the Blood Rift .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The company was composed by 500 members of various kinds of yugoloth.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1373 DR , Inthracis was approached by the god Vhaeraun , who demanded that Inthracis kill the three priestesses who were candidates to become the Yor'thae (Chosen of Lolth): Quenthel Baenre , Danifae Yauntyrr , and Halisstra Melarn . As a reward, Vhaeraun promised Inthracis a higher position. Inthracis led his company to the Pass of the Soulreaver near the Demonweb Pits and there battled Quenthel, Danifae, Halisstra, Jeggred Baenre , and Pharaun Mizzrym . They defeated the regiment, however, and Inthracis was killed by Pharaun. His death was not permanent, however, as he had another clone body to revive in.</p>
