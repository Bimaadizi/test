<p>A torque ( also : torc ) was a style of jewelry worn about the neck.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Unlike a necklace , a torque was crafted as a single piece, which was attached around the wearer's neck by bending the metal.</p>
<p>Torques could be made from a variety of materials. A simple copper torque might sell for 5 silver pieces , but the addition of gemstones or extra details in the design would raise the price higher. The base prices for silver , gold , or platinum torques in most economies were 5, 50, and 500 gold pieces , respectively. Aurora's Emporium sold silver torques in style of the Moonshae Isles for 50 gold pieces. These were crafted with two ram 's heads, each with emerald eyes.</p>
