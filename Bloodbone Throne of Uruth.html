<p>The Bloodbone Throne of Uruth served as the throne for three of the orcish kings of the realm of Uruth Ukrypt until it was stolen.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The throne was made from the fused bones of the orc-king's defeated enemies, particularly the defenders of Uthtower and Phalorm , and a great crag cat . The seat itself was made from the ribcage of the crag cat and the back was a triangular stack of skulls, each with a single eye of Gruumsh . The stairs leading up to the throne were believed to be made from the skulls of six Phalorm princes. Overall the throne had a diameter of over 12 feet (3.7 meters) and a height of 10 feet (3 meters).</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When someone sat upon the throne, they could call upon its various powers. Among them were the ability to shroud the throne in unholy darkness, command nearby creatures, spew a cloud of greasy darkness, and cloak themselves in a dragon -shaped shroud of bones. Perhaps the most powerful ability of the throne, and the one that gave its name, was the ability to summon forth a " blood elemental " of varying degrees in size. The elemental was essentially a water elemental whose touch could cause one's blood to boil.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Fashioned for the first king of Uruth Ukrypt , the Bloodbone Throne went on to serve two additional orcish kings in the Sword Mountains . During the Rage of Dragons , the realm was attacked by the black dragon Shammagar and the green dragon Claugiyliamatar . Shammagar seized the orcs' capital at Melairrin as his new lair, and the throne was among the treasures he claimed.</p>
<p>When a rogue named Asilther Graelor plundered Shammagar's hoard over three centuries later, she took possession of the throne for a short time. It was soon lost in transit on its way to Herald's Holdfast during an ambush near the town of Nesmé . Where it went from there is not definitively known. Rumors spread that it may have been in the western reaches of the High Forest , where it was being used by an antlered orc king.</p>
