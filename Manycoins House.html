<p>Manycoins House , sometime misnamed as Moneycoins House , was a templed dedicated to Waukeen , the Merchant's Friend, and the Merchants' League offices, located in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Manycoins House stood on an intersection of Stormshore Street and Hammaskarl's Ride , just two blocks away from the Basilisk Gate in the Eastway neighborhood of the Lower City.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The large temple structure was roughly L-shaped and was a four-story building with an attic space where the temple's dormers were located. The building also included stall stables and roofed coach storage available to the customers and guests.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The temple provided all the regular religious Waukeenar services. Additionally, the complex offered secure rental-stall stables and coach storage, as well as short-term rental lodgings primarily used to conduct business in Baldur's Gate. Each of these lodgings included a bedroom chamber, a bathing chamber, and a "trading chamber" â€“ spaced used for business meetings and negotiations. Guests received laundering and bathing services, as well as bread and water. Despite the lack of meals, guests were given access to oven facilities. Renting was priced at a single silver coin and an offering to Waukeen.</p>
<p>Among religious services, Manycoins House offered training to lay people and novice priests of Waukeen. Little advertised offerings included privacy of many undisclosed secret passages and discrete paid vaults for storing of small items of any nature.</p>
