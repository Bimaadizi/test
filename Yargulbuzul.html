<p>Yargulbuzul was an imp and a sadistic warlock patron from the Abyss , who, at one point, granted power to Sholsarrath the Lame , a kobold warlock of the Skulking Dragon clan, some years before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Sholsarrath, a kobold shaman, entered a warlock's pact with Yargulbuzul, sacrificing a finger and a foot in exchange for power and to avoid a gruesome death. Now known as Sholsarrath the Lame, the kobold took over the Skulking Dragon clan and began raiding nearby farming communities, including the village of Houndstown . The raids attracted the attention of five adventurers who slaughtered the strongest kobolds with ease. Desperate once again to escape sure doom, Sholsarrath the Lame evoked Yargulbuzul's name once again, demanding salvation and a way to escape. Yargulbuzul claimed that it would be a tough feat to accomplish and demanded one last payment from the kobold, a payment greater than anything he paid before. The dim-witted warlock agreed frantically to Yargulbuzul's demandâ€”the kobold's own head. When the five adventurers reached the shaman's lair, they witnessed a happy imp decapitating Sholsarrath and carrying his soul to the Abyss . That head would become the Head of the Lame Kobold , an enchanted helmet for warlocks.</p>
