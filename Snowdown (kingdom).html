<p>Snowdown was a Ffolk kingdom that controlled the island of the same name until it was annexed by Amn at the start of the 15 th century DR . It has been the richest and safest of the Ffolk lands in the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Snowdown was a monarchy ruled from Caer Westphal by the Kincaid family, with the land itself (and notably its farms) overseen by several dozen lesser lords who ruled from fortified manors. It was the most democratic of the Ffolk kingdoms, with the lords of larger settlements (such as Brannoch , Harloch , Llandrian , and Pengram ) able to have meaningful influence on the policies of the realm. Snowdown had a bidirectional trade relationship directly with Amn.</p>
<p>Taxes were notably higher in Snowdown than elsewhere in the Moonshaes, however the money was put to effective use building roads and training the militia. The royal family was well-liked by the populace.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Snowdown had no deep-water harbors, thus making trade difficult and forcing the realm to be largely self-sufficient. No major maritime trade routes connected to the island, however merchant ships from Amn and Calimshan were known to visit on their ways to larger Moonshae ports.</p>
<p>The island's relatively warm climate meant that its agriculture was the most productive in the Moonshae Isles, and so the royal family was known to provide supplies to the other Isles to bolster their popularity. On occasion, "leaf-collectors" were sent abroad by royal order to bring back rare seeds and plants from Faerûn to cultivate on Snowdown. The only other notable exports came from the island's mines.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The kingdom's best defense against the Ffolk's longstanding enemies of Northlander raiders was the simple fact that the island was further from the Northlander territory than the lands of Callidyrr , Corwell , or Moray , meaning that raids were rare.</p>
<p>The realm maintained well-funded and well-trained militias based out of its larger settlements, where 20% of the population (roughly 140 to 240 fighters per cantrev) could be mobilized. Each of these fighters was skilled with the use of longswords and either spears or longbows , and were organized into small units that could mobilize quickly to respond to threats, most notably from pirates out of the Nelanther Isles . By the mid–14 th century DR, the kingdom's roads were mostly free of marauding monsters thanks to aggressive patrols by the militias.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early History</h3>
<p>Snowdown was one of the earlier kingdoms established by the Ffolk after their arrival in the Moonshaes during in the 2 nd century DR.</p>
<p>When High King Carrig III was assassinated in the Year of the Flame Tongue, 500 DR , his widow, Queen Abigail , appointed Snowdown's King Edmund Kincaid as regent over all the Ffolk of the Moonshae Isles until Carrig III's heir, Colin , came of age in the Year of the Rotting Pox, 507 DR .</p>
<h3>Modern History</h3>
<p>When Elminster toured the major Ffolk kingdoms of the Moonshaes around the Year of the Snow Winds, 1335 DR , Snowdown was the only one he did not visit. He noted that Ffolk of other isles rarely mentioned it.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Saddle, 1345 DR , King Pwylloch of Snowdown was assassinated by Razfallow on the orders of Cyndre , thus ending the current royal line.</p>
<p>Following the events of the Darkwalker War , members of a Snowdown-based thieves' guild known as the Broken Ring began working with the Risen Cult of Bane .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , Snowdown was gripped by a slew of mysterious bandit raids by the " Black Dwarf ", who would plunder, raid, and disappear, leaving a signature mark of a black axe painted on a yellow shield left in the wreckage. The bounty on this bandit was raised to 600 gold pieces before a heinous attack on a merchant camp outside Pengram prompted the king and lords of Snowdown to consider mustering their entire militia to scour the land for them.</p>
<h3>Fall</h3>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR, Amnian interests became deeply entrenched within Snowdown, establishing homes as well as extensive trade and business operations that brought increased wealth to the people of the kingdom. This made the Ffolk of other islands concerned about the influence Amn might wield over Snowdown, but the Snowdowners themselves dismissed these worries. They continued to ignore any concerns even as it was rumored than Amn had fomented civil unrest against High Queen Alicia Kendrick .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Sceptered One, 1404 DR , Amn hired mercenaries to invade Snowdown. They annexed the kingdom with little resistance, imprisoned the royal family in order to keep the populace in line, and subjected the island to colonial rule. High Queen of the United Moonshae Isles Alicia Kendrick would continue to contest Amn for control of Snowdown until her death in the Year of the Halls Unhaunted, 1407 DR , even founding a new order of knights for the purpose of retaking the island, but to no avail.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The people of Snowdown enjoyed the luxuries and relative safety that their realm afforded them, and were slow to acknowledge any problems with their lifestyles. Most other Ffolk saw them as aloof, unfriendly, and lazy, or felt that they talked too much and did too little to help the other islands. Outside the kingdom, "Snowdowner" was used as an insult for those who refused to take sides or who seemed overfed or overdressed.</p>
