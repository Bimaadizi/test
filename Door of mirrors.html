<p>A door of mirrors was a door that sporadically effected those that passed through it's arch in a number of ways. At first it would summon a few exact mirror copies of the person or creature that duplicated their every move for 2-7 minutes. After this time, the mirror copies would merge back with the target, electrocuting and confusing them.</p>
<p>These doors were often created so that they would only sporadically trigger, such as once per day, every fourth creature passing through or by random chance</p>
