<p>A Scarab of enraging enemies was a type of magical jewelry formed into a pin.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When a Scarab of enraging enemies was on display and the command word uttered, all intelligent hostiles 40 ft (12 m) or closer became enraged unless they were able to suppress the spell effect. The rage lasted between 1 and 2 minutes and under the effect they could not recognize friend from foe, instead just launching themselves against the closest target. Most scarabs of this kind contained some 19-24 charges.</p>
