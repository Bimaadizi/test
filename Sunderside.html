<p>Sunderside was a small but palatial mansion owned by the Ampner family of Ravens Bluff during the 14 th century DR , located within the city's Temple District . Despite its size, the manor was divided into unassuming rental apartments that were particularly well-decorated. The noble Ampners maintained one of the suits as a sort of domestic getaway, when they wished to stay in the city without letting others know of their whereabouts.</p>
<p>The manor was located on the corner of Waelstar Way and Dragonscale Street in the Swordspoint neighborhood.</p>
