<p>Omar bin Omar was a member of the Dancing Dwarves who lived in Huzuz , the City of Delights, in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Omar tied his long hair and beard into braids that spun around during his dances.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Omar was a dervish , meaning he could only access his clerical powers after completing a wild dance. He performed these dances in the suqs of Huzuz in front of a live cobra . The cobra became hypnotized by Omar's movements, but the clever dwarf sewed the snake's mouth shut just in case. The cobra would eventually starve to death, but a nearly unlimited supply could be found in the wilds surrounding the city.</p>
