<p>Sorcere was one of the three schools at the Tier Breche academy in Menzoberranzan . It was within Sorcere that drow mages and wizards were trained. It was nicknamed "the Tower."</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<h3>Exterior</h3>
<p>Sorcere's complex was made from sculpted stalagmite towers. The tower itself had many spires and was located against the western wall of the Tier Breche cavern.</p>
<h3>Interior</h3>
<p>Sorcere had hallways filled with paintings, sculptures, and framed magical texts. All students lived alone in the apprentices' wing and were allocated austere quarters with a pallet and a zurkhwood desk and chair. The interior walls of the complex were lined with lead sheeting and stucco from gorgon's blood and spellstore dust.</p>
<p>Sorcere's scrying chambers were large and circular. The walls were lined with lead sheeting and stucco from gorgon's blood and spellstore dust, just as the rest of Sorcere. Runes of gold were inscribed on the walls to protect against magical intrusion. In the middle was a huge scrying crystal bound with the eye of an eagle that was living beneath the crystal in a cage. Mages could cast spells through the crystal. However, it was destroyed circa 1373 DR when spells cast on Nimor Imphraezl rebounded.</p>
<p>The summoning chamber in Sorcere was a room with great columns rising to flying buttresses some 80 feet up. There was a circle of mushroom-stem chairs secured to the floor. (Whether these chairs were temporarily or a permanent fixture was unclear.)</p>
<p>Gromph Baenre had his own quarters in Sorcere with no windows, a desk of polished bone with extradimensional drawers with fronts containing different skulls. Only Gromph could open them. There was an access shaft in its own pseudoplane that had no wards. Sigils to protect the quarters summoned a fire elemental and cast the spell imprisonment . The floor was made of marble and there were also many bookshelves with scrolls. The rooms were lit by perpetual red candles held in skeleton hand candleholders. Gromph's chair was plush, while the visitor's chair was made of hard wood. The door was made of black marble with silver runes.</p>
<h3>Cavern of Masters</h3>
<p>The Cavern of Masters was a cave situated on the east side of Menzoberranzan. Although not part of the Tier Breche complex, it was reserved for students of Sorcere to practice their spells in.</p>
<h2>Schooling</h2>
<p>All drow nobles at the academy had to spend a short time studying magic here, but only males who wished to dedicate their lives to the ancient skills stayed longer as students to master the talent. Drow wizards spent about 30 years at Sorcere studying, usually beginning their training at 25 years of age.</p>
<p>Many powerful drow mages spent time at Sorcere. Only the finest were selected to be permanent residents and teachers. It was said that only drow males resided at and attended Sorcere, but at least one female, Noori Baenre , in residence circa 1373 DR , was granted an exception to this rule and allowed to study arcane magic there. Previously, Liriel Baenre , though she was very gifted and well-trained in arcane magic, had not been sponsored by her father, Gromph Baenre, for Sorcere as he thought her being the only female enrolled and his daughter would draw too much intrigue and controversy.</p>
<p>There was a test of endurance at Sorcere that required students to cast spells while masters held flames to their skin.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Sorcere was run by a council of mages, all of whom were counted among the masters of Sorcere. The leader of this council was Horroodissomoth Xorlarrin in 1370 DR , second only to the Archmage of Menzoberranzan , Gromph Baenre . However, at least in 1372 DR , Gromph was serving as the Head Master of Sorcere.</p>
<p>In addition, there was the post of Archmage Emeritus, who was responsible for all teaching at the academy. He was also in charge of and experimenting with the most powerful magical items held by Sorcere. He was secretly Sorcere's overseer of security, and hence the spymaster in charge of watching the noble houses. In 1370 DR this post was held by Courdh Mizzrym .</p>
<p>Instructors of Sorcere were known as masters and there appeared to be specific masters of certain Schools of Magic . Masters had their own signet rings bearing the mark of Sorecere which lent power to their spells. In 1361 , seven wizards of House Xorlarrin were serving as masters. Masters of Sorcere wore rings indicating them as such; these rings were able to detect magic .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1372 DR , during the Silence of Lolth , the masters of Sorcere performed a ritual spell calling a storm with rain and lightning to save the city from hordes of revolting slaves and disillusioned drow males.</p>
