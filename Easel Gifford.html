<p>Based in the third ring of Glyth , Easel led Code Helm in launching attacks on illithids , both on the planet below and against their spelljammers .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Easel wore at all times a suit of full plate mail forged from platinum and polished to perfection, and also had a ring of protection +3 . Most notably, he wielded the "Fist of Obedience", as he called itâ€”actually a longsword +3 . The sword was not only sentient, it communicated telepathically with Easel. No one could lie in Easel's presence, for the sword would sense it and inform him of the deception.</p>
