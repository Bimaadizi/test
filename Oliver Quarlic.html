<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Oliver Quarlic's monster hunter tribe found itself targeted by the vampires of Baldur's Gate during the Absolute crisis when the Gurs camped in the Rivington district of Baldur's Gate, along with a small army of refugees displaced by the conflict. To the Gurs' horror, the tribe's children were abducted by the vampires under orders from Cazador Szarr . Oliver's superstitious nature though that the gods had abandoned the tribe and that they were likely cursed , despite Ulma's assurance of it not being the case.</p>
