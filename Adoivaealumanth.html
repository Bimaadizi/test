<p>Adoivaealumanth ( pronounced : / ɑː d ɔɪ ˈ v eɪl uː m ɑː n θ / ah-doy-VALE-oo-manth ) was a small holy city in the Aryselmalyr Empire that over time fell to ruin, leaving only its grand temple to Deep Sashelas .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This city was located beneath the Sea of Fallen Stars , in an area known as the Easting Reach , off the coast of Telflamm .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The various buildings within Adoivaealumanth were constructed of various types of coral . After the city was abandoned, with no one to tend to them the buildings grew into massive coral reefs, sealing up the doorways and windows they once had.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Having been founded for the purposes of religious devotion, neither trade nor any political activities were conducted in the holy city of Adoivaealumanth.</p>
<h2>Notable Buildings</h2>
<p>In addition to its grand temple to Deep Sashelas, the city held a great temple to Trishina and smaller temples to all other deities of the ocean that were commonly worshiped in Serôs .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Adoivaealumanth was constructed in −3645 DR as a labor of religious devotion by lesser royals of Aryselmalyr. Over the centuries it went unscathed by the many wars that plagued Serôs, having been protected by the Law of Gods, one of the Laws of Battle of that all Serôsians followed, which dictated that battles could not be fought upon holy grounds.</p>
<p>However, sometime around the Year of the Painful Price, 718 DR , during the Tenth Serôs War , an unknown force was unleashed in the city that spread a virulent disease rendering gills raw and blistered. Over a period of what Serôsians referred to as "two tides" the whole populace of Adoivaealumanth fell to the illness. The city was then left abandoned for centuries, considered by Serôsians to be cursed .</p>
<p>At some point, two large ships, which were either sailing towards or from the port city of Telflamm, fell directly upon the ruined city. Its coral reefs would overtake these wrecks with time, incorporating the skeletons they left behind.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Snarling Dragon, 1279 DR , members of the Church of Deep Sashelas made efforts to reclaim Adoivaealumanth and its grand temple to their god. Taking up residence within the temple, they split their time between exploring the city for any treasures it might still hold, cleaning it up, and tending to the faithful.</p>
