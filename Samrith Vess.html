<p>Samrith Vess was an accomplished scribe and researcher from Baldur's Gate who was active in the late 15 th century DR . She was an expert on Chultan history.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Samrith was empathetic and had a good and sincere heart. She sought knowledge for the sake of enlightening herself and others, and tales of ancient Chult made her giddy.</p>
<p>While she was very well read, she believed that true knowledge could only be gained through experience. She dreamed of visiting the ruins of Mezro upon learning that the city had been built by a god .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>She traveled with her father's old spellbooks despite not being a wizard like he had been.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She was very close with her bodyguard, Zara , and would grip her arm tightly when excited. Zara, in turn, was permissive and protective.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Samrith spent most of her life in libraries and places of learning on the Sword Coast . Through her extensive reading, she came to be enamored with stories about Chult, particularly the ruined city of Mezro. She became an expert in Mezroan history, including everything from the construction of the Maze of Life to the special tea once enjoyed by the city's royalty. Eventually, she decided that she had to visit Chult for herself in order to gain the kind of experience and expertise that books could not provide.</p>
<p>Around the time that the death curse struck Toril , Samrith spent her savings to book a trip from Baldur's Gate to Port Nyanzaru . Once there, she arranged for the guide Qawasha to take her and Zara to the ruins of Mezro.</p>
<p>She learned a great deal about Mezro from the knowledgeable Qawasha during the journey to Mezro, most notably that he believed that the city had not actually been destroyed but rather removed from Chult and placed into a "paradise." Once they neared the ruins, Samrith was approached by a trusting chwinga , who traded her a magic charm in exchange for a seashell from the Moonshae Isles . This very charm would later grant Qawasha a vision of a terrible device located deep in the jungle that was preventing Mezro from being restored. Samrith promised to join him in a quest to destroy the device, and proposed to return to Port Nyanzaru and finally study to become a wizard like her father.</p>
