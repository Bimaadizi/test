<p>Gideon Lightward was a corrupted priest of Lathander in Elturel during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Despite being corrupted, Gideon still viewed himself as a bastion of good because his objective was only to destroy all demons. However he was filled with hatred for those that did not obey his commands.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gideon was a very zealous priest of Lathander. Zariel , believing him a very useful asset, in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR sent various devils posing as angels to slowly corrupt him by offering great power to battle demons .</p>
<p>In time, Gideon gave his free will completely to the archdevil and when Elturel was dragged down to the Nine Hells he was Zariel's most loyal servant. Gideon died during the fall but rose as an undead creature.</p>
<p>Thanks to the dark energies of the Companion , he began to assemble all the dead of the city's cemetery into a undead army to battle the demons.</p>
<p>He barricaded himself inside the Chapel of Mourning together with two mezzoloths while waiting to resurrect his army of undead.</p>
