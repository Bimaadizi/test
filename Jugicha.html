<p>Jugicha was a city in the Plain of Horses of northwestern Kara-Tur . It was the home of the Tsu-tsu tribe and the second-largest city of the Plain of Horses after Li-Raz .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It lay at the western foot of the Chigidi Mountains , beside the Chukei Plains . Roads led northeast to Li-Raz and north to Haxkhun and eventually Peqqir .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around Shou Year 2100 (850 DR) , a band of rebels split from the Fankiang city of Li-Raz. They desired to found their own community, and so settled Jugicha. This triggered a realignment of the hsing (clans), of the Plain of Horses, ultimately giving rise to the Tsu-tsu tribe.</p>
<p>Circa Shou Year 2587 (1337 DR) , the qaghan (ruler) of the Tsu-tsu and Jugicha was Shajji Ghoiji . Ghoiji was corrupt and his government fell into chaos and finally rebellion. Ghoiji's apa qaghan , his assistant and brother Shajji Hoijarek , stepped in, gathering capable advisors to his side and becoming qaghan in his place. Over the next two decades, Hoijarek worked to reestablish order in Jugicha and revive Tsu-tsu prosperity.</p>
<p>Hoijarek remained as qaghan of Jugicha and the Tsu-tsu around Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Jugicha held a number of temples staffed by lamas .</p>
<h2>People</h2>
<p>The Tsu-tsu people of Jugicha were considered to be superb herders, hunters, and producers of livestock. They were semi-nomadic, spending most of their year on the steppes, before returning to their villages or the city of Jugicha. Thus, each Tsu-tsu family had two homes: tents in the summer and brick houses in the winter.</p>
