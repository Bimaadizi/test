<p>Tragedy's Grotto was a small hollow and shrine to Ilmater , the Crying God, and St. Ulrach found in the city of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The grotto was tucked away between some villas and merchant compounds, in a spot easily overlooked and easily avoided—just as the wealthy citizens of this neighborhood preferred.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Only 90 feet (27 meters) at its widest, it was a narrow grotto between three tree-covered knolls atop which the rear walls of the villas and compounds stood. A fast-flowing stream ran down the middle and was fed by two tributaries. At the heart of the grotto, the stream widened into a small pool, 20 feet (6.1 meters) wide. At the center of this pool stood a statue of St. Ulrach, which served as the shrine to Ilmater. Although unkempt and grim, it was nevertheless a very picturesque place.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This place had a long and storied history as a place of sadness, suffering, and misfortune, in happenings small and great and with more than its fair share. In particular, it was the scene of no small number of suicides. Thus, it came to be called Tragedy's Grotto by the folk of Loudwater. Because of this reputation, the site was considered sacred to the Crying God.</p>
<p>The last elf to rule Loudwater took her own life here in the late 10 th century DR . Her reasons were lost with her.</p>
<p>According to local stories, heroes of Loudwater of the time first sighted the approaching Rensha forces from here in the Year of the Scourge, 1150 DR . They took over Loudwater and laid claim to most of Delimbiyr Vale for centuries to come.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The monks of the Monastery of St. Ulrach came regularly but not frequently to tend to Tragedy's Grotto in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
