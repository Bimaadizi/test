<p>The Fortress of Jorhat , or Jorhat Citadel , was a fortification located in the Hordelands .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The ruins of this fortress sat halfway up the mountain of Jorhat Shan .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Though a mess of ruins, the Fortress of Jorhat covered several acres of the mountainside. Tightly packed buildings, alleys, and walls were in various state of disrepair. Much of them had collapsed and tumbled down the steep cliff faces.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Many tunnels and passageways were carved into the rock beneath the fortress, most of which were only accessible from the ruins.</p>
<h2>Rumors and Legends</h2>
<p>Locals believed the fortress was initially constructed by rebels engaged in a conflict with Mulhorand , serving as their main base from which they executed raids through the Howling Gap and Teyla Shan . The rebels were eventually cornered by a force of wizards , priests, and soldiers and were slaughtered to the last man.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The fortress had actually been built for Imaskari armies to keep watch on Kara-Tur . Its defenses were so powerful that it was one of the last to fall before the might of the risen Mulhorandi slaves; even then, when the rebels finally reached the gates, the Artificer Mardava cast a disastrous spell that slew every last one of the attackers and defenders at once, including herself. The spell turned her into a nightwalker ; she prowled the lower levels since.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Most sane people avoided the ruins of the Fortress of Jorhat. Passing caravans on the Iron Road hurried quickly by the mass of crumbling buildings, choosing to camp far from the ruins which were believed to be haunted. The rumor was true; the citadel was indeed haunted by the nightwalker Mardava, a former Imaskari artificer from the ancient past.</p>
