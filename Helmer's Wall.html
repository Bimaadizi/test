<p>Helmer's Wall was a tavern in Silverymoon around 1365 DR . It was named for the fact that a large part of its structure was formerly a gatehouse in the since-torn-down old city wall.</p>
<p>It was frequented by students from the many colleges of Silverymoon. Hence there was always eager chatter, toasts, games, pranks, and romance, as well as drunk people getting up on the tables to make speeches or recite poetry, with things hurled at those that were pretentious, rambling, or just terrible enough to deserve it.</p>
<p>However, it served good ale and better wine . Prices were average.</p>
