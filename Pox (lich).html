<p>Pox was a female lich and a leader of the Cult of the Dragon cell in Yartar in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Pox hated everyone from Zhentil Keep and the Zhentarim . She had a close bond with Saurglyce . She observed from afar the founding of Luruar , planning future plots against it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the past, Pox appeared to have had some bad dealings with Zhentil Keep and the Zhentarim.</p>
<p>She claimed to have become a lich using a copy of the Tome of the Dragon , but this claim was suspect as the other copies of the tome described only the process to create a dracolich . What was known was that one day Pox arrived in Yartar riding the white dragon dracolich Saurglyce, her partner. They began to gather followers to establish a Cult cell in the city.</p>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , after the Rage of Dragons , the drow-dragon Nurvureem aided Cult rebels to drive Pox and Saurglyce out of Yartar.</p>
