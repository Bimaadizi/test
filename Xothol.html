Once the Empire fell in −339 DR , support for the arcane institution waned in the kingdom and it was finally shut down by King Tormalk in −286 DR , and magically sealed until it was needed once again. The college remain unmolested during the fall of Ammarindar during the rampage of the demons from Ascalhorn in 882 DR , and well into the 14 th century DR .</p>
