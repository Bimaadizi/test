<p>The Silver Blades were an adventuring band formed by Oswulf .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Silver Blades consisted of the leader and twelve great heroes.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>This organization based themselves in the Temple of Tyr in Verdigris . Here, they trained and paid respect to the Even-Handed.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the midâ€“11 th century DR , two brothers, Oswulf and Eldamar , built a castle in the Dragonspine Mountains . Eldamar became a lich many years later, and Oswulf left the valley to form a group of heroes. He found twelve adventurers and the Silver Blades was founded.</p>
<p>The newly formed band made their way to Verdigris, and fought off many who roamed the ruined town. Oswulf did not wish to slay his brother, and so the wizards and clerics of the Silver Blades researched a spell to freeze the entire valley. Eldamar's forces attacked the Silver Blades as the spell was being cast, and Oswulf fell protecting his companions. Many of the Silver Blades perished in both the clearing of the town and taking on Eldamar's hordes. The remaining blades befell different fates: some were imprisoned in magical cages by Eldamar's minions, whilst others were bound to the temple of Tyr.</p>
