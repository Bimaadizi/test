<p>Blacklake was a lake found in the city of Neverwinter .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The lake sat in the middle of a city park, and was large enough to support boating. During summer months, it would shrink and leave behind a smelly and muddy swamp at its edges, which would become overgrown with brambles.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The lake was located in the center of the Blacklake District , which was named for it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Pollution</h3>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , Blacklake became utterly polluted by ash and debris from the eruption of Mount Hotenow in the Year of Knowledge Unearthed, 1451 DR , as well as by filth and rubbish from the refugees and vagabonds who made their homes in nearby ruined houses. It even contained several destroyed ships. By 1479 DR , the lake looked more like a midden pit, overflowing with a thick, black sludge than a body of water.</p>
<p>That same year, the sludge even developed magical properties and gave rise to sludge-covered zombies in the streets, suggesting it was more than mere pollution, and alchemists like Hazel studied the phenomenon. The cause of this transformation was apparently the corrupting power of Ghaunadaur , a god of abominations and oozes , for a self-proclaimed Chosen of Ghaunadaur later led an attack of sludge zombies on Blacklake District. He was defeated by Hazel and the Hero of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge .</p>
<h3>Restoration</h3>
<p>Efforts to dredge and restore the lake and surrounding park had begun in the late 1470s DR, and by the end of the decade this had become one of New Neverwinter 's goals.</p>
<p>As of 1489 DR , the lake had been significantly cleaned and cleared, and it was renamed the "Bluelake," although it remains unclear to what extent this name entered into general use.</p>
