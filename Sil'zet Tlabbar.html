<p>Sil'zet Tlabbar was the favorite daughter of Ghenni Tlabbar , matron mother of House Faen Tlabbar , the fourth house of Menzoberranzan until the Silence of Lolth .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sil'zet was the oldest and favorite daughter of Ghenni. In 1372 DR , Ghenni was targeted by Nimor Imphraezl of the Jaezred Chaulssin as part of his bargain with House Agrach Dyrr , who wanted Ghenni dead. Nimor infiltrated the Faen Tlabbar complex and unfortunately Sil'zet was at her mother's side at that time, so Nimor killed both Ghenni and Sil'zet.</p>
