<p>The Fountains of Creation , also known as the Para-Elemental Plane of Magma , or the Plane of Magma , was the Inner Plane at the intersection of the Planes of Fire and Earth . It was a place of boiling, molten earth and toxic fumes.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The plane was a vast mountain range of volcanoes that started at the border with the Plane of Earth and extended well into the Plane of Fire, forming an arc around the vast Cinder Wastes . There were also many floating islands of volcanic rock that had not yet fully liquified.</p>
<p>Much of the air on this plane was acidic and poisonous . Its clouds were composed of burning acidic vapors and raw elemental fire . Temperatures were close to that of the Plane of Fire. Most unprotected fluids and water brought into the plane boiled away near instantly into superheated vapor.</p>
<h3>Cosmography</h3>
<p>Lava flowing from the Fountains of Creation into the Plane of Earth formed a region known as the Furnaces , where the dao inhabitants of the plane used the lava to power their forges.</p>
<p>The Fountains of Creation were considered to have some of the most abundant elemental vortices of all the para-elemental planes, occurring in the heart of almost every active volcano on the Prime Material plane .</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>Some of the more bestial elementals to be found on this plane included fire bats , thoqqua , a large number of animentals , and small animate burning rocks known as blazons .</p>
<p>One of the few flora that could be found on this plane was the magical tandersol , a plant whose stem was pure fire and leaves were metallic gold . People often braved the hazards of this plane to obtain those leaves, as they could be used to make +3 scale armor that had resistance to heat and flame.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h3>Boundary Regions</h3>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Fountains of Creation were the birthplace of most of the lava children and magmin . The latter lived in small, hunter-gather tribes that were united, while the former dwelt in small underground communities and were frequently trying to avoid enslavement by the dao that came to the plane. The magmin often struck bargains with elementals and para-elementals, but had no love for mephits .</p>
<p>This plane was also the native realm of magma para-elementals , who along with magma mephits were the most commonly encountered creature on this place. Magma para-elementals had no set leaders among them, no borders, and lacked internal conflicts. They also had good relations with the plane's magmin. The magma mephits that inhabited this plane were always feuding with fire mephits , while magma para-elementals waged war on both types. Though they generally tried to avoid conflict with magma mephits when they could, as they were undoubtedly the reigning race on that plane.</p>
<p>Fire giants primarily lived within Thermax, but could be found in strongholds scattered throughout the plane. They and many other natives made their homes on floating islands of volcanic rock. Fire giants could also be found living inside the volcanoes of this plane, as could azers , red dragons , and native inhabitants of both the Plane of Earth and the Plane of Fire.</p>
<p>Many inhabitants of the plane were known to engage in warfare with the dao, who sailed across the surface of the plane's magma on obsidian ships. The ones that did the most to keep them in check was a large force of efreet , though it was not always conflict between them, as sometimes dao and efreet met on this plane to do trade. When it came to enslavement, the dao primarily targeted magmin and mephits.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Some rumors claimed that a race of black skinned humanoids that spoke sideways lived amid the steam that rose from this plane's magma.</p>
<p>In addition, some regions of this plane's magma sea were rumored to contain schools of deadly fish that had been magically altered to thrive in the lava.</p>
