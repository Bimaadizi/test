<p>Gantar Kraok was an aquatic elf tyrant in Serôs in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Gantar was one of the most ruthless, manipulative people on Toril . Thanks to equal parts determination, arrogance, and foresight, he created very complex plans where he double-crossed his own allies. He would flee if defeat seemed certain. He truly believed that elves should rule Serôs and that he should be the coronal.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gantar Kraok formed the Saratycoron , a group with the objective of making the elves rulers of the world. For these ideas, he was exiled from Selu'Maraar during the Eleventh Serôs War .</p>
<p>During that conflict, he found the Alatorin Scepter and used it as a weapon.</p>
<p>At one point, Gantar discovered the Librarian , a living kiira situated in the Hall of Living Memory in a ruined elven city. Thanks to the Librarian, Gantar also recovered the lost Wyrmskull Throne and planned to recover all the remaining lost Ruling Scepters of Shanatar .</p>
<p>Thanks to his schemes, Gantar discovered that agents of Inselm Hhune had recovered the Sondarr Scepter and sent his agent Estelar Sunweaver to monitor the situation. He was waiting for the right time to act, using the Throne's powers to claim the Scepter for him. He also allied with the morkoth arcount Axar Xyrl in exchange for the promise of gaining a copy of the Tome of Tujar the Dark Adherent .</p>
<p>Finally, in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , on the night of Uktar 10 after the brawl in the Blue Badger's Inn in the village of Toralth in Tethyr , Bapar Ghalmrin recovered the Scepter from Inselm's agents. Gantar decided this was the right time to act: using his ring of telekinesis , he teleported the scepter to him in Serôs, alongside Bapar's party. Quickly Gantar seized the scepter and teleported away.</p>
<p>Later, pursued by the dwarves and other surface-dwellers, Gantar first sent a sea hag disguised as himself.</p>
<p>Afterward, if need be, he sent his morkoth allies to organize an ambush. During the fighting, he too, together with Arcount Axar Xyrl, entered the battle. However, Gantar did not care if he hit the morkoth and when Axar Xyrl and Duupox confronted the elf about it, Gantar insulted everyone in the place and teleported away.</p>
<p>Then Gantar hid in his well-protected lair, the Hall of Living Memory , a forgotten elven ruin housing the living kiira the Librarian.</p>
