<p>Pypyap or Pipyap was an imp familiar of Halvin Graingle in the Quivering Forest near Phlan in the late 1480s DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Pypyap was a very friendly devil , albeit ill-willed. He was honest in his dealings and talkative. He enjoyed being on Toril and he had no wish to go back to the Nine Hells . For this reason, he was also very cautious about being killed.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1485 DR , Pipyap was in Maerimydra in the Underdark , where he was harassed by some ogres . He was saved by an adventuring party hired by Solom Ned'razak to collect some samples of blood from fiendborne fire giants . Pipyap was grateful to the adventurers and helped guide them through the city.</p>
<p>Pypyap was later summoned from the Nine Hells by Halvin Graingle, a member of the Cult of the Dragon , to act as his familiar. Circa 1489 DR , he went with his master to the Kabel's Hill community in the Quivering Forest. After Halvin's disappearance, Pypyap went to ravage the local livestock. Here he was discovered by an adventuring party hired to find Halvin.</p>
