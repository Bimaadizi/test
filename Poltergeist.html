<p>Poltergeists were invisible undead creatures.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Poltergeists were invisible to all creatures except those who had the ability to see invisible creatures and objects. When visible, a poltergeist looks like a human clothed in tattered rags and wrapped with heavy chains , upon which were attached items that represented the evil actions the poltergeist committed when alive.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Poltergeists were malicious and wicked. Their sole purpose was to inflict suffering on the living. This undying, destructive rage was fueled by their confusion over having no sense of how they had died.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Poltergeists projected an aura of fear around them. Unlike most undead, poltergeists were immune to holy water .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Poltergeists harassed the living by throwing objects at them. If a person was hit with such an object, they were not harmed. A poltergeist could only be hurt or killed by magical weapons or a weapon made from silver . Holy symbols of good-aligned clerics temporarily drove a poltergeist from the area.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Poltergeists were the restless souls of beings who committed evil deeds when alive, deeds for which they were never brought to justice for. There were two types of poltergeist, those who were forced to wander about and those who were tied to a specific area. Poltergeists who were bonded to an area lived there when alive, while those who were wanderers were killed away from their home, and were forced to wander endlessly, unable to return to their home. Poltergeists who were bonded to an area were much stronger than the wandering variety, and were thus more difficult to dispel or kill.</p>
<p>They did not require nourishment nor did they hoard treasure from their victims.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Poltergeists could be found throughout Faerûn . They were encountered in Icewind Dale , Orvaskyte Keep , the Rat Hills , Ravens Bluff , Solon , Undermountain , and Waterdeep .</p>
<p>Beyond the Prime Material plane , poltergeists could be found in the Domains of Dread .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
