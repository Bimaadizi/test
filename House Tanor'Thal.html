<p>House Tanor'Thal was the dominant house in the drow city of Karsoluthiyl in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<p>The house sold a large number of slaves in Skullport . Using a portal to their outpost of Kyorlamshin , led by Matron Haelra Tanor'Thal 's niece Kesra , they captured any potential slaves that they could and sold them in the bazaars of Skullport. House Tanor'Thal was, in fact, Skullport's most prominent drow slaving organization.</p>
<p>Political pressure was being put on Matron Tanor'Thal back in Karsoluthiyl to allow access to Kyorlamshin's portal for the other houses of the city. This was a concession the matron mother did not wish to make.</p>
<p>House Tanor'Thal also established itself in Spiderhaven , where a lot of displaced drow had recently begun to dwell as of 1375 DR .</p>
