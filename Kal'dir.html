<p>Kal'dir was the most powerful lieutenant of the Xanathar Thieves' Guild in Skullport in 1479 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally Kal'dir was a noble in an unknown drow city, but his House was totally destroyed and only he survived. Without allies or resources, Kal'dir wandered for a while in the Underdark until he met a beholder cluster. He was charmed to serve them.</p>
<p>In 1479 DR, he willingly became their emissary to Waterdeep in order to help the new Xanathar , Zushaxx , to establish himself as the new Xanathar. Kal'dir assassinated all the previous lieutenants of the guild. Zushaxx quickly affirmed his rule and Kal'dir was chosen as one of the new lieutenants.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>

<h2>Residence</h2>
<p>Usually, Kal'dir resided in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep or in the Mistshore district.</p>
<h2>Relationship</h2>
<p>Kal'dir was the most trusted servant of Zushaxx and the only one to know his true identity. In time, he developed feelings for his fellow lieutenant Sial Sapphire .</p>
