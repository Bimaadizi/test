<p>Thessarelle's Platter was one of the most high-class restaurants in Suzail in the late 15 th century DR . The establishment was sometimes referred to as Thessarelle's , but referring to it as "The Platter" was considered undignified.</p>
<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
<p>While still a posh establishment, many considered Thessarelle's to have fallen out of fashion by the late 1470s DR. Even so, Lord Haeldown called it popular and in vogue, when condemning its choice as a venue after a failed plot.</p>
<p>Thessarelle's unfashionability often left it mostly empty, making for a much more peaceable and affordable posh dining experience. As a consequence, it was frequented by highly ranked courtiers, visiting outlanders , and rich Cormyreans who that possessed neither titles nor ambitions to rise through the hierarchies.</p>
<p>The proprietress, Thessarelle , was known to be haughty and proud. Her staff were likewise well-mannered and conducted their job with much grace.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , several Cormyrean nobles were looking to weaken King Foril's court, even if it meant disposing of incorruptible officials like the Lady Clerk of the Rolls , Rensharra Ironstave . Thessarelle's was the site of one such assassination attempt, and it would have succeeded too, were it not for Mirt the Moneylender .</p>
<h2>Food and drink</h2>
<p>Apart from the general fare found in such Cormyrean restaurants, Thessarelle's offered wines , fried hocks-and-tongues, boar , and dishes based on potatoes .</p>
