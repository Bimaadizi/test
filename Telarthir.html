<p>Telarthir , or Great Telarthir, Emperor of the Ninth Dynasty of Lords was a long-forgotten ruler of a long-forgotten kingdom of antiquity.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Telarthir lived many centuries before 1372 DR , and by the 14 th century DR , he, nor his dynasty, nor his kingdom was remembered. His final resting place was within a well-hidden tomb in the Brush of Barbs of Delimbiyr Vale . Telarthir's tomb 's location was known to only few and several maps that led to it existed and were sold for mere change, though to be fakes.</p>
<p>In his eternal rest, Telarthir was preserved as a warrior mummy who along with his servant skeleton warriors guarded the tomb. An unwitting aspiring adventurer Fernigold the Younger gained entrance to the tomb but was slain by the mummy.</p>
