<p>Marv was a human bouncer who kept peace at the Black Eye tavern and festhall in the city of Westgate in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Marv was a giant of a man with short chestnut-colored hair. He was 6 feet and 6 inches (2 meters) tall and was built like an ox . However, he was overshadowed by his truly massive brother and fellow bouncer, Gregory , and the tavern's proprietor, another hulking brother, named Little Davey .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Marv's favorite entertainer who worked at the Black Eye, Dimples the Dancer, disappeared and stopped showing up for work. In reality, "Dimples" was a member of Westgate's City Guard and she danced for patrons of the festhall as a hobby. She twisted her ankle in the line of duty and simply wasn't able to perform until she was healed.</p>
