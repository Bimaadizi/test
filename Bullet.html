<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bullets were spherically shaped and usually pieces of lead, which was very dense. Sling bullets could also be made of copper or even exotic materials, such as the knuckles of salamanders or chips of elementals .</p>
<p>They most often came in leather pouches , which could hold ten of them. Like arrows and bolts , some bullets were enchanted in some way so that they could deal more damage. Bullets that struck targets were destroyed in the process, but had a chance of being recovered.</p>
