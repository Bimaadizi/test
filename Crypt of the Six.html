<p>The Crypt of the Six was one of many Anaurian tombs littered throughout the Serpent Hills . It housed the bodies of multiple counselors and their families and contained a number of magical guardians, along with a path forcing travelers to wander the Abyss before delving deeper. Because of these defenses, it was one of the few tombs in the area to never be looted.</p>
