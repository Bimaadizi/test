<p>The amber acorns of the Moonwood Circle was the name for a type of necklace made by the druids who lived in the Moonwood forest.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The necklace appeared as four acorns carved from amber , strung together with a cord that resembled interwoven roots. Each acorn contained a small piece of elemental matter, one for each of the four elements: air , earth , fire , and water .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to their disappearance in 1305 DR , following a series of conflicts with the People of the Black Blood known as the Beast Wars , the druids of the Moonwood had set up a series of caches of magical items across what was then called the Silver Marches . The most well-known of these items were the amber acorn necklaces.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Once per day, the wearer of this necklace could cast summon nature's ally VI and conjure forth a creature attuned to each elemental type. Each elementally attuned acorn had one daily charge, allowing for four creatures to be summoned.</p>
