<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 1374 DR , the Shattered Spear tribe came across the shipwreck of the Vigilant , a vessel that belonged to Sa'Sani 's trade company. The Batiri attacked the survivors, including the infamous author Volothamp Geddarm . Some of the survivors ended up captured by Taelunangul's goblins along with some of the ship's precious cargo. At the same time, another group of survivors was confronted by Ghzermag, Clawkeeper Kzheemoc , and Shoudul of the Skulls . Volo tried to persuade the charming locals to let the survivors go, but Ghzermag the Wild spoke not a word of Common , and Volo was not as proficient in Goblin language as he claimed to be. In the ensuing fight, Ghzermag and his kin were slain.</p>
