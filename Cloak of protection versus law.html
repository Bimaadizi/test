<p>Cloaks of protection versus law were enchanted cloaks that sheltered their wearers from law enforcement.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Cloaks of protection versus law and their stronger version, greater cloaks of protection versus law both gave the wearer enhanced protection of +2 and +5 enchantment respectively when facing law-abiding and law-venerating creatures.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the Fire Knives were driven out of Cormyr in 1341 DR , Lord Tagreth Cormaeril , the assassins' guild's leader commissioned numerous cloaks of protection versus law for the assassins willing to target the members of the Obarskyr royal family. Most of these assassins died in the process of hunting down King Azoun Obarskyr IV and his family and the cloaks ended up going into a wider circulation.</p>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR , cloaks of protection versus law could be found in Neverwinter , all across the Sword Coast North , and in the Moonsea region.</p>
