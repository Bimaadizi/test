<p>The wraith eidolon was a unique eidolon created by the arcanists of Netheril to protect the outpost of Xin'kar .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was constructed by means of shadow magic and "dark emotions".</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The wraith eidolon was created some time after Xin'kar was founded, following the Fall of Netheril in the Year of Sundered Webs, âˆ’339 DR . It served as a protector for the Netherese scholars for some time until the Uthgardt barbarians of the Gray Wolf tribe overran Xin'kar. During the invasion, the last remaining resident of Xin'kar attempted to activate the wraith eidolon, but could not reach it in time.</p>
<p>It remained in a state of dormancy for centuries until the late 15 th century DR . A group of bandits broke into Xin'kar looking for ancient relics and inadvertently activated the wraith eidolon.</p>
<p>Some time later, the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge delved into Xin'kar in order to recover ancient Uthgardt relic for the Forsworn . The hero dismantled the wraith eidolon once and for all.</p>
