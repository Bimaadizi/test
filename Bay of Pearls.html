<p>The Bay of Pearls was a large bay in the southern region of the Windrise Ports of Laerakond . The port city of Sambral was located there. The bay was shallow (often less than 100 feet) and was renowned for its pearl-making oysters.</p>
<p>The waters of the Bay of Pearls were crystal-like and full of fishes. According to locals, the name of the bay came either from the abundance of pearls found there or from its iridescent sand floor, whose gleaming minerals washed down from the Nightmare's Hoof and were visible from the surface.</p>
