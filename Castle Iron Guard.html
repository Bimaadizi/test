<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , in the early days of the Three Women War, the Ravens Bluff Army put out a call to mercenaries in the Ravens Bluff Trumpeter , telling them to report to Castle Iron Guard for a contract and assignment.</p>
<p>Late into the war, the Ravens Bluff Army caught win of the enemy planning an attack on Mossbridges and routed their forces there for battle. However, this was merely a ruse orchestrated by the turncoat Commander Nioga and his Company of the Bloody Hatchets , meant to draw the army away so that Myrkyssa Jelan 's forces could invade the city without interference. A group of six adventurers in the army learned of Nioga's deceit and were sent home by General Obespieri to warn General Koran Therogeon , commander of the City Defense Forces.</p>
<p>They rode hard through the night to reach Ravens Bluff in time. When they arrived around dawn, the City Guardsmen informed them that Nioga had rode through earlier asking where he could find Therogeon. Sources differ on whether the adventurers managed to arrive to Castle Iron Guard in time to confront Nioga, but most agree that by the time they arrived they found Therogeon murdered at his desk. Lady Caroline Skyhawk , Therogeon's second-in-command, would arrive shortly thereafter. Shocked at the gruesome scene, she demanded to be debriefed on the situation.</p>
<p>Quickly ascertaining the truthfulness of the adventurers' words, Skyhawk snapped to action and wasted no time in yelling out the door at office boy Tremai to "Quickly, rouse the commanders, the runners and the entire staff! We are under attack! Sound the warning bells, prepare the gates! And Tremai, get the High Sorcerer in here, in his small clothes if necessary!" Before long cries of "Attack" and "Awaken" rang throughout the fortress. She then turned to the adventurers, told them to get rest and report to her by next dawn, and began to intently study a map that had been spread across Therogeon's desk.</p>
