<p>Ojel was one of the frost giants that was held prisoner in the Darkmoon temple led by Dran Draggore .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The frost giant inhabited the crimson tower of Temple Darkmoon in 1358 DR . He appeared to have gone mad, having been partially turned into a tree.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The lunatic frost giant seemed to be one of the experiments of Dran Draggore, the evil high priest of Darkmoon. In a neighboring room, another of his kin was kept, who was also shrunk down to human -like size. He warned of Dran's evils and cowardice, and then turned to stone. Ojel, who was trapped by an unknown force, was encountered by the Heroes of Waterdeep . The giant gave them coins, which acted as keys to further progress through the tower.</p>
