<p>A retch plant , also known as a globe palm , was a type of tree .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Retch plants resembled regular palm trees . From the top foliage grew large spherical fruits. The fruit had a firm but membranous interior and varied in color, usually blue, lilac or violet.</p>
<p>The fruit's interior held a sticky and putrid liquid. When they fell from the tree, the fruit exploded and covered everything within 5 ft (1.5 m) with said liquid. If a creature was struck with the liquid, it was so foul that it triggered nausea and vomiting. The fluid's scent attracted carnivorous creatures up to 50 ft (15 m) distant, and the only way to remove it was with alcohol.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>The plant whose mature variety produced poisonous pepper -like dust, which prevented its own seedlings from growing in the nearby area.</p>
