<p>As a member of the Eternal Order of Kelemvor , Volahk's mission was to preserve and keep sacred the Neverdeath Graveyard in the city.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Volahk was tasked with leading the efforts to wrest Neverdeath from the clutches of undead forces raised by Thayan and Red Wizards like Jack and the followers of Valindra Shadowmantle . The group was met with overwhelming forces of Thayan undead that drove them to retreat to Doomguide's Watch .</p>
<p>Volahk then sent an expedition of his fellow doomguides into Pauper's Field to clear out the undead in that region of Neverdeath. While the expedition's leader Severin was able to send word they were preparing to descend into the Rift , the group never returned. In response, Volahk worked with an acolyte by the name of Neyman and an adventurer to find Severin and defeat the Red Wizards that had captured the doomguides.</p>
<p>Volahk and the adventurer tracked down the other missing doomguides. Falstaff and Awen were killed and Stonehammer turned as undead, but Winlof , Ganilon , and Severin were merely captured, being held by the Red Wizards in various crypts.</p>
<p>Finally, Volahk came to realize that the a Red Wizard by the name of Xivros sought to raise the infamous ogre warlord Arleon the Unforgiven as an undead minion to serve their cause.</p>
