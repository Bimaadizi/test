<p>Klandaerlas Glymril was a wizard and the Master of Glymril Gard during the mid–8 th century DR .</p>

<p>He liked it when the scene out his window was tranquil.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>During the night of his death, he wore a black robe.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He could place wyverns in spell-thrall, and had the ability to raise towers from ruins, though this bound them to his lifeforce.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Two of his guards were Halglond and Curthas . He also kept numerous wyverns in spell-thrall, which he kept rather on the edge of starvation.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He carried at least one wand and was the owner of Glymril Gard , a tower he raised from a ruin with his own magic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Klandaerlas Glymril had at some point raised his fortress, Glymril Gard, from the ruins of an earlier fortress by using magic. He had also gathered a number of wyverns he kept under ongoing spell-thrall.</p>
<p>One night late in the Year of Mistmaidens, 764 DR , Klandaerlas Glymril noticed an enigmatic entity that was attracting the attention of his guards, and came out of his tower with a wand to threaten it. The creature hardened into the shape of a woman, and then swept through him; he died with a scream before turning into a pyre. The tower collapsed nigh-instantly upon his passing.</p>
