<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point before the turn of the 9 th century, when Justal Iroon was already an old man, he was slain by Radellus , who fancied his tower near Sreve for his own. Radellus flung Justal Iroon's smoking body the length of Sreve's main street; it was then whisked into the millpond, killing all its fish. Unknown to either mage, a young Kurtal snuck into the tower and stole three of Justal's spellbooks during the exchange of spells.</p>
