<p>The Plane of Mirrors , also known as the mirror realm , was a mysterious secret plane known to and visited by few inhabitants of the Realms .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This transitive plane existed behind mirrors and other reflective surfaces, such as windows. The Plane of Mirrors was essentially a stretch of corridors filled with the backs of several mirrors. Once inside, one could turn back to the entry way and gaze out through the Material Plane . However, those on the Material Plane would only see their own reflection.</p>
<p>In terms of planar traits, the secretive Plane of Mirrors was somewhat similar to the Material Plane. Magic functioned normal, as did gravity and time. Breathing was normal throughout the plane, with air being cycled in from other locales through each mirror, drawing in fog, smoke, new scents or other airborne sensations.</p>
<p>There were no naturally-occurring food sources on the plane, though myriad of travelers have brought foreign food within.</p>
<h2>Cosmography</h2>
<p>It was possible to access the Plane of Mirrors with the use of a specific spell and an item such as a large mirror. Once in the Plane of Mirrors, it was possible to exit through another mirror, leading to another plane in the multiverse , whether it be an Outer Plane , Inner Plane , or the same plane one originally came from.</p>
<p>The "floor" of the Plane of Mirrors was in fact a shared border with the Ethereal plane , accessible by the spaces in between each mirror.</p>
<p>Radiant energy "leaked" into the plane from the Positive Energy plane , repairing its mirrors and healing any living beings that were not imbued with necrotic or Negative energy .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Though largely unknown to many of the Realms, the Plane of Mirrors did hold some inhabitants. Curiously, when one stepped into this transitive plane, a mirror version of oneself would also spawn. The mirror version would have completely the opposite alignment and even be left-handed if the original version was right-handed. The mirror-self could only leave the Plane of Mirrors if it killed its original self.</p>
<p>There were barely any races native to this plane, though mirror mephits were known to lurk here. Such mephits were frequently summoned by Zhentarim -allied demons , as well as the Red Wizards of Thay .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The ancient bronze dragon Nymmurh was the protector of the Waterdhavian House Silmerhelve , and laired over the Moonshae Isles . However, during the most recent Rage of Dragons , he miscast a spell through a mirror. In doing so, he was sent to the Plane of Mirrors, and became obsessed with learning about the nerra race.</p>
