<p>Dobin Noreth was a member of the Stone-Cold Reavers , a group of reckless adventurers who made their living sometimes as sellswords and sometimes as brigands.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Dobin's mount was a well-dispositioned, retired racehorse named Four-Leaf Clover.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The group tried to steal the presumed treasure hoard of the young white dragon Cryovain from its lair, Icespire Hold . Dobin was sent to the nearby village of Phandalin to gather supplies while the rest of the Stone-Cold Reavers waited for the dragon to leave its lair so they could plunder it in its absence. However, Cryovain hadn't amassed any treasure yet.</p>
