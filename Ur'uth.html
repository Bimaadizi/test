<p>Ur'uth was a vicious wolf animal companion of Kith'rak Therezzyn , the githyanki commander of Crèche Y'llek within the ruined Rosymorn Monastery in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ur'uth was a huge and fierce-looking wolf with brown fur.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kith'rak Therezzyn, along with other gith of what would become Crèche Y'llek, attacked and claimed the Rosymorn Monastery of Lathander in the Western Heartlands of west Faerûn sometime before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . Soon after, the function of the crèche was changed as the githyanki war against the mind flayers in Faerûn shifted its balance. The gith sought the astral prism , the artifact that imprisoned Orpheus , the long-lost son of Gith . During that time, Ur'uth and D'hak were both serving Kith'rak Therezzyn, devouring enemies of the crèche upon the mistress's command completely and fully, including armor. Ur'uth was quite proud of his ability to pass devoured armor. Some of the people devoured by Ur'uth and D'hak were the Cult of the Absolute members Mahrin and Burrock .</p>
