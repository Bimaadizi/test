<p>Ramarthant Horaerays was a mage of the late 15 th century DR and the Magister during the turn of the century.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was quiet and thoughtful.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Ramarthant had mastered his trove of enchanted devices sufficiently to become a powerhouse of magic. One unique spell of his allowed him to transport beholders from elsewhere to other places as he pleased.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Ramarthant had acquired a significant cache of Netherese enchanted devices.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before becoming the Magister, Ramarthant had been an adventurer for three decades, through which he had amassed a small hoard of enchanted items. In the Year of the Duplicitous Courtier, 1496 DR , with Mystra 's blessing, Azuth offered the office of Magister to Ramarthant Horaerays upon the death of Valargrim Hond .</p>
<p>Upon receiving the mantle of office, he was immediately set upon by sixteen liches sent by Szass Tam , and defeated all of them. He then retaliated by magically sending several Zhentarim beholders straight into Thaymount , where they caused great chaos. No further attempts from Szass Tam were known.</p>
<p>He since disappeared into a number of lairs across Faer√ªn . Of note, he'd defeated a young arcanist from Thultanthar who'd tried to seize the Magister's cache to grow mightier.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Ramarthant had not faced many challenges, because he was difficult to find. He spent most of his time modifying magic and devices he owned, to better defend himself with.</p>
