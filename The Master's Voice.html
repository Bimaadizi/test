<p>The Master's Voice was a tavern that once stood in the town of Y没lash in the Moonsea region, ruined by 1357 DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Master's Voice stood at the heart of the ruined Y没lash with an occupying force of the Red Plumes ' checkpoint to the northwest, stables across the street to the north, and a bakery next door to the east.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the ruination of Y没lash, The Master's Voice only suggested its previous use through remnants of a bar and copious broken glass and pottery across its taproom. A sign outside read: "The Master's Voice, A Drinking Establishment of Quality." In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , an occasional Red Plume mercenary from the nearby checkpoint snuck into the Master's Voice for an unauthorized nap.</p>
