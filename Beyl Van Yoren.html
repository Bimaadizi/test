<p>Beyl Van Yoren was a monk who studied as a part of the Dark Moon monastic traditions some years before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Beyl Van Yoren's place in history was due to her creating enchanted monk robes of the Dark Moonâ€Ž . Beyl found herself struggling with the order's teachings that prioritized speed over strength. Her struggles continued until one day she started showing lightning speed. The young woman spent several months "trading favors" with a wizard to earn these magic robes that granted her speed as if under constant effect of the haste spell . Even though the Dark Moon tutors were satisfied, Beyl found herself unable to concentrate on lessons. Due to the break-neck speed, she often got bored and restless. Eventually, Beyl abandoned her Sharran training as well as the magic robes and decided to move in with the wizard who created the robes of the Dark Moon .</p>
