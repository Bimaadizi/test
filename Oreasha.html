<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Oreasha entered into an infernal contract with the mortal Krydle of Baldur's Gate . As Bel had taken great interest in the half-elf rogue , Oreasha agreed to protect Krydle's friends while they were trapped in Elturel during the city's descent into Avernus and free Shandie from the clutches of some chain devils , in exchange for his soul to be delivered to Bel. The mortal Krydle agreed to this deal, and had seared upon his arm a reminder of their "soul pact".</p>
<p>She reappeared after Krydle was infected with a mind flayer tadpole and in danger of undergoing ceremorphosis . She removed the tadpole with infernal magic. [ citationÂ needed ]</p>
