<p>The Well of the Chasm was a deep canyon set within the Scimitar Spires in the desert of Anauroch . Due to the natural source of fresh water found within its depths, it was also an oasis that provided succor to the Bedine people that dwelled in the harsh desert lands.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Well of the Chasm was a vast subterranean valley set over 500 ft (0.15 km) beneath the sands of the Anauroch. It was accessible by a long, winding canyon that was accessible by a narrow passageway set within the Scimitar Spires. While the entrance to the the Chasm was a mere 9 ft (2.7 m) in width, the canyon itself varied anywhere from 10 ft (3 m) to 80 ft (24 m) in width.</p>
<p>The Chasm itself was set into the bedrock beneath the desert, with a floor of sand that was covered with boulders. A single stream of fresh, opaque water passed beneath a pit set into the sands of the Chasm.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The Well of the Chasm was easily defensible due to its form and structure.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
