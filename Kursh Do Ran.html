<p>Kursh Do Ran , also known by his title, Grinds the Sand , was a dwarvish sha'ir planeswalker from Zakhara and a member of a trans-dimensional organization called the Order of the Eternals in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kursh wore a beard, typical for the men and women of his race, but kept it immaculately clean. The beard was long and was usually tucked into his belt . Kursh wore a turban .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The Dwarven Mage was an uppity erudite with a loud personality prone to rants. He was among very few individuals from the world of Toril , along with Elminster Aumar , who knew what a micro-organism was. If Kursh Do Ran was asked to teach magic to other dwarves of non-Zakharan origin, the Dwarven Mage always refused to share his craft. He did not like to lie nor brag and was a dedicated "worshiper" of the elements and the genie-kind.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Through his impressive magical prowess and his earth gen familiar , Kursh Do Ran had access to virtually any spell, including priestly magics. Like others of his kin, the Dwarven Mage possessed infravision . He could intuitively detect depth whilst underground, detect grades of slopes in passages, new tunnels or passage construction, sliding or shifting walls or rooms, stonework traps, pits, and deadfalls. Thanks to his affinity with the genies , he was resistant to elemental, and especially earth elemental attacks.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Lil' Mountain was Kursh's loyal daolanin familiar, a quick-witted and spirited individual, just like his master, who would fetch spells from across the planes on command for the Dwarven Mage.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the Order of the Eternals elected to hold its 1,238 th annual Symposium in the city of Ravens Bluff , in order to secretly investigate its unusually high levels of magical energies and planar incursions, Kursh Do Ran was among the guests and members who stayed at Glittering Star Inn for the multi-day event.</p>
<p>The Symposium did not go smoothly as a notorious villain known as the Sewer Lich attempted to burglarize one of the ranking members of the Order using several employees of the inn. One of them was Sally , who was murdered soon after the burglary, her head and heart tossed into the inn's well. The Dwarven Mage was the only guest who managed to notice there was something foul in the inn's water offered to the event's attendee; he went on long rants about how such a backwater place as the Bluff served water tainted with poisons , toxins, and "micro-organisms." His rant helped several mage adventurers of the Living City to discover the truth about Sally's death.</p>
