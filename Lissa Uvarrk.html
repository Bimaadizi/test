<p>Lissa Uvarrk was a gnome of Thentia , quite adept at transmutation . Per Rilitar Shadow-water , she had died some time before Mirtul 20 of 1373Â DR . Presumably, this was because of a spirit she summoned, which slipped her leash. By Mirtul 26 , Taegan Nightwind and him were disabused of the idea, and certain that she had not summoned any spirits, but that a different magician had bound the fiend and used it to slay her.</p>
