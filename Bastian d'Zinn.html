<p>Bastian d'Zinn was a human member of the upper class that inhabited the city of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bastian was a richly-dressed human man with a skin of bronze. He had brown eyes, brown and well-trimmed mustache and a goatee, with a mop of styled long blond hair.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the city of Baldur's Gate was suffering from the encroaching war with the Cult of the Absolute , an influx of refugees, scarcity of resources, and increase in crime. Bastian d'Zinn was a wealthy enough individual who could look down on the fellow Baldurians. He was convinced that the city had been on a downwards spiral for quite some time and everyone who did not admit that was either a street vermin or soft-hearted fool. He believed that the new Archduke of Baldur's Gate Enver Gortash was going to bring good old days back and make the Gate great again. During one of his walks down a shop-filled street, Bastian was hit in the head with a pebble by a playing child. The kid, Rhaneld , ended up being yelled at by Bastian and the curfuffle attracted a small crowd of Baldurians with varied opinions on the child.</p>
