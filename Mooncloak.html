After the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , it functioned as a cloak of resistance of variable strength, with water walk and levitate each usable only once a day.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Mooncloaks were most often created by an appearance of moonfire at a Selûnite ritual, when the goddess Selûne was pleased and only as she willed. These items were intended for use by the clergy. Nevertheless, by 1372 DR, other spellcasters had discovered how to replicate them. This required the levitate and water walk spells in addition to resistance .</p>
