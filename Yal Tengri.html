<p>Yal Tengri , also known as the Great Ice Sea , was an arm of the ocean that covered the north pole of Toril . All sorts of cold-loving creatures were found in its waters.</p>
<p>The sea was open for about six months of the year. Fall brought rapidly dropping temperatures and the water gradually froze over. In the winter Yal Tengri was basically a sheet of ice, broken only by a few dangerous shifting ribbons of open water. As spring dawned, icebergs calve off the permanent ice cap and the melting began.</p>
