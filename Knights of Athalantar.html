<p>The Knights of Athalantar were the fighting force of Athalantar in the late 2 nd to 3 rd century DR . They were briefly outlaws during the reign of the Magelords of Athalantar .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Knights of Athalantar under King Uthgrael Aumar were drawn from the ranks of his comrades in arms.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Originally warriors for Uthgrael, at least one faction of them descended into banditry, gathering a number of outlaws to themselves.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>One group of outlaws took refuge in a dwarven ruin known as Lawless Castle in the time between the death of King Uthgrael Aumar and the death of Belaur Aumar .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>During the reign of Belaur Aumar, the Knights of Athalantar under Helm Stoneblade , not loyal to him or to the Magelords of Athalantar , became outlaws.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally the comrades of King Uthgrael Aumar, the Knights of Athalantar dissolved upon his death as such, acting instead as retainers of different princes of the realm. Helm Stoneblade continued to helm a specific faction, which retained the name even unto the crowning of Prince Belaur Aumar, but became rivals to him and his Magelords, becoming brigands who did not recognize his authority.</p>
<p>One band of outlaws recognizing Helm's authority was led by Sargeth ; they operated out of the hidden Lawless Castle , a dwarven outpost in the Horn Hills until its location became known to the Magelords during Hammer of the Year of the Loremasters, 228 DR . They sent forward one of their own, Eladar the Dark, to prevent outriders from reporting the outpost, but even after meeting with Helm Stoneblade and slaying the entire camp where they made the report, the castle's location was compromised by other means.</p>
<p>The rebel Knights later joined Prince Elminster Aumar 's forces preparing to besiege Athalgard in the Year of the Chosen, 240 DR , agreeing to disguise themselves as traders and take refuge close to the palace, where the magic of the elves of the High Forest would allow them to get close to the Magelords in Athalgard and slay them all.</p>
<p>After Elminster successfully sieged Athalgard and slew the Magelords, the Knight Helm Stoneblade became the next king of Athalantar.</p>
