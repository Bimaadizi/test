<p>Sammaresh , known as the City of Dancing Dolphins , was a city in Lapaliiya in southwest Faerûn in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It stood at the western end of the Lapal Way , and marked the westernmost settlement of Lapaliiya. It was huddled between three low hills that gave out onto a wide sandy beach at the eastern side of the Dolphingulf , which was of course known for its dolphins .</p>
<h2>Population</h2>
<p>Sammaresh was home to 21,912 people in 1373 DR .</p>
<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>The people made their living off the sea, by fishing and collecting emerald oysters for their rare and valuable pearls . As the bay was so shallow, the city's docks stretched almost half a mile (800 meters) out to sea, where the water was sufficiently deep for a ship's draft. Aquatic elves living among the undersea hills in the bay also often went to the markets of Sammaresh to trade rare treasures of the sea.</p>
<h2>Government & Religion</h2>
<p>The ruler of Sammaresh sat upon the Mantimera Throne (named for the mantimera ). A former Lord of Sammaresh was Daster Mremman . Circa 1373 DR, the city was ruled by Lady Ilnara Mremman .</p>
<p>The rulers were traditionally advised by the Whispering Serpent , thought to be the ghost of a couatl . Another important post was the Lord Sage, such as Sambrin Ulgrythyn in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<p>The civic deity of Sammaresh was Selûne the Moonmaiden. The people regularly made pilgrimages to the Abbey of Tharynd , just over the border in the Tashalar .</p>
