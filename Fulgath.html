<p>Fulgath was a male human merchant from Dagger Falls that owned Fulgath's Caravan Supplies . He was well known for both his high prices and wide range of equipment.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Fulgath always appeared to be quietly chuckling to himself when customers arrived.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Widely disliked among the folk of Dagger Falls , Fulgath happily over-charged any patrons who came to his shop, as he knew had a monopoly on caravan goods. Throughout his career, Fulgath had been dishonest and curt in his dealings with others.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Ever dealing in underhand businesses, Fulgath would use whatever means he could to make more coin. He regularly charged a 200% markup on most of his goods. The merchant was the only individual in town that dealt in stolen goods and even poisons , many of which he would gladly procure from corpses.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Zhent occupation</h3>
<p>During the Zhent occupation of Dagger Falls , much trade to the market square was stifled and gave Fulgath a near-monopoly on many goods. This meant Fulgath was able to easily charge over the odds for his goods and was garnering a markup of 200% by 1367 DR .</p>
<h3>Return of Randal Morn</h3>
<p>After Randal Morn reclaimed the town in 1369 DR and the market began to prosper again, Fulgath took to stealing and even vandalizing the competition's goods from the stall-keepers. Fulgath was eventually caught by priests of Lathander and after a stern dressing down and fine by Harndarr Oryn his activities stopped.</p>
<p>Eventually, by late 1369 DR , Fulgath was forced to relent to the growing competition of the Market and had to cut back on his selection of goods and even slightly lower his extortionate prices.</p>
