<p>Griffon's Roost was a towering mountain peak among the hills surrounding the city of Ravens Bluff in the Vast , so named for having been used as a landing spot for riders of griffons , hippogriffs , and other flying mounts that were dropping off important visitors, noblemen, costly goods for merchants, or important messages. By the late 14 th century DR , it was being used by the Griffon Ride , the city's elite cavalry regiment.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The top of the spiraling peak was the exit point of a one-way portal in Wyllowwood , a sublevel of the legendary Sword Coast North dungeon known as Undermountain .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In spring of the Year of the Harp, 1355 DR , notorious con artist Mortimer Mittlemer was expecting the delivery of six ceramic cylinders, one of which concealed the stolen emerald collection of a wealthy Dalefolk lord near Shadowdale . He couldn't ask his courier Warden Jameson to land his griffon mount just anywhere near Ravens Bluff, as it could attract unwanted attention, so Mortimer requested he land at Griffon's Roost. However, being a wanted conman, he couldn't travel through several neighborhoods and pick up the package himself.</p>
<p>Mortimer then came up with a scheme, wherein he would use his illusion magic to take on the appearance of Charles Frederik La Verne Blacktree IV , but go by the alias of "Lord Merriwether Winston Sheffield-Trublood the Third". He then had his trusted friend Elmerth Willow go out as a representative of this bogus nobleman and hire a group of adventurers to retrieve the package for him. Elmerth managed to find a willing group of six adventurers in Volodar's Stardust Inn . When the adventurers met Lord Merriwether at the docks, he fabricated an excuse that he couldn't retrieve his package himself as he'd be a target of pickpockets in Crow's End and the Southside District .</p>
<p>At the peak they were met by griffon rider Warden Jameson, dressed in a long forest green robe with white embroidery and a tall, off-white turban with a silver & onyx brooch pinned to its front. Warden was initially hesitant, as he had only been anticipating Mortimer sending at most two couriers, and rebuffed them when they tried to inquire as to what was inside the cylinders. It was unknown whether or not the adventurers stuck to their original arrangement and delivered the cylinders to Mortimer.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , a Dwarven citadel in Realmspace was skyjacked by a illusionist trickster named Tim Tumbleweed , who refused to leave until its denizens could best him in joke telling. The desperate dwarves traveled to nearby Sel√ªne and from its residents were told that Toril harbored plenty of adventurers. They fanned out over the planet in search of someone that could aid them in ridding their citadel of Tim's menace. The pair Dilwa Dundab & Thorin Bucklebrand traveled to the Vast, landing atop Griffon's Roost in a wasp . At that time the region was in the midst of the Three Women War and a group of giant eagles on loan from Procampur were roosting on the peak.</p>
<p>The pair luckily managed to find a group of adventurers in Ravens Bluff willing to help and escorted them to their spelljammer . By the time the party arrived, a platoon of City Watchmen were surrounding the ship. Watch Sergeant John Blackwater , quite agitated by the matter, inquired as to whether they were the owners of the vessel and expressed his desire for them to vacate Griffon's Roost. However, Commander Caroline Skyhawk of the Griffon Ride had notions of using their wasp against Myrkyssa Jelan 's forces and asked if they had more ships like it. The two parties managed to hash out an arrangement, promising the services of three wasps and a thousand stout dwarven troops for Ravens Bluff's defense for the next year, but only if the adventurers could rid them of Tim Tumbleweed.</p>
