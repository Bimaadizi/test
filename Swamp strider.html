<p>Swamp striders were a species of swarming, predatory insects that could walk across bodies of water thanks to their physiology.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These insects were about the size of mundane beetles , measuring 7 inches (0.18 meters) in length and weighing 0.5 pounds (0.23 kilograms). They had dangerously long, spiked suckers.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Swamp striders could see in areas of total darkness , as well as sense creatures within 30 feet (9.1 meters) of them walking in the same body of water.</p>
<p>These insects were capable of walking across water as if effected by water walk and would even float to the surface if submerged.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>When in a swarm, swamp striders would surround and attack living warm-blooded prey larger than them. They pierced them with their suckers to cause bleeding.</p>
