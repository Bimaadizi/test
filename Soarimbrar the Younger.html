<p>Soarimbrar Heltharn the Younger was a boy king of Impiltur who never ruled.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Soarimbrar was the son of Prince Verimlaun . He was named after his grandfather . He had an older sister named Ilmara. Soarimbrar was related to King Imphras II through Imphras' fourth son Velimbrar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Born in 1335 DR , Soarimbrar was declared king of Impiltur at the age of three years when King Rilimbrar , Queen Ilbritha , Crown Prince Imphras IV , and his own father, Prince Verimlaun all died in a mysterious fire at the royal tower. Because Soarimbrar was too young to rule, his relative, Princess Sambryl , became Queen-Regent, as it was determined that her husband, Imphras IV, died after her father King Rilimbrar, and thus she had become a queen.</p>
<p>King Soarimbrar, however, never lived to see the throne. He was murdered only a matter of days before his coronation when he had come of age in 1351 DR . He had been riding through some farmlands near Lyrabar and his entire retinue died with him. His assassins were never caught.</p>
<p>Soarimbrar's nephew Imphras V became the next king, but he, too, was not old enough to reign.</p>
