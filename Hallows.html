<p>The Hallows were a stretch of forest that the elves of Cormanthyr used for revels.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Several shadowtop trees sprung up in the garden, with canopies so thick they blocked out the sun; the only sunbeams visible were from rare clearings. The ground was a "lawn of mosses" in which small mushrooms were planted. The light came from air-globes that glowed faintly in ruby red, gold, green, or blue as they drifted to and fro. Trays floated under some of the globes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 241Â DR , a revel took place in the Hallows in which the recently titled human armathor Elminster Aumar substituted for Coronal Eltargrim Irithyl , leading to the explosion in the Narnpool and his hunt later that evening.</p>
