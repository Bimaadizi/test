<p>Gahlaerd Mossmere was a prominent wizard of Tilverton who developed and sold unique spells.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Gahlaerd was a sarcastic and silver-tongued man who greatly enjoyed his comfortable and prosperous life in Tilverton.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Galaerhd spent much of his time researching and creating new spells, which he sold to visiting mages once or twice a year for 10,000 gp per spell level. This gave him more than enough to live luxuriously, support his projects, and protect himself with expensive magical defenses.</p>
<p>He also semi-secretly worked with anyone of low repute who came to him for lesser work, and developed an alliance of sorts with the Rogues of Tilverton . He provided them with magical services and a safehouse connected to the sewers, and in return they never targeted him with their crimes and brought him magical treasures they couldn't use.</p>
<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>Persistent rumors in Tilverton had it that Gahlaerd worked alongside any shady characters that approached him with work, such as the Rogues of Tilverton, which he casually denied. The rumors were all true, of course.</p>
