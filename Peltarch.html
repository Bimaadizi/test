<p>Peltarch was the only permanent town of any size in Narfell as of 1479 DR , with most of the inhabitants being Nars of the Ulyoon tribe.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The town was located on the southern shore of Icelace Lake and was constructed from the masonry of Old Peltarch to the north of the current settlement.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Peltarch traded with many foreigners, as the few caravans that took the route over the frozen ice of the Icelace Lake in winter, instead of the far more dangerous Giantspire Gap , came to this settlement to do their trade. This made them wealthier than the rest of their kinsmen, who in turn considered them outlanders.</p>
