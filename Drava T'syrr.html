<p>Drava T'syrr was a drow warrior in Cormanthor in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Drava lived in Szith Morcane until it fell to fiendish fire giants circa 1486 DR . She led eight companions to Cormanthor. There, however, she fell under the madness of the demon lord Graz'zt and started to dance and drink.</p>
<p>Some adventurers (members of the Harpers hired by Elanil Elassidil to bring peace to her ancestor Meira Faerenduil ) tried to convince Drava and her companions to go to a refugee camp but she never complied and in the end she was defeated.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Drava fell completely to Graz'zt's madness, in particular giving herself over to hedonistic impulses, drinking and singing. She was fearful of surface-dwellers, convinced that any meeting would inevitably end in bloodshed.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Drava always had at her side her second-in-command, the mage Ilztoj A'Qaran .</p>
