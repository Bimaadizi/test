<p>Kaff , or the Palm , was the northernmost island of the Djinni's Claws southwest of mainland Zakhara .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Kaff's position along a major trade route, combined with its safe harbors and fresh supply of water, made it a haven for a unique group of pirates. These Kaffia pirates were actually undead ghouls , lacedons , and ghasts . They raided ships not for treasure, but for flesh to sate their ravenous appetites. They typically did so during the night, but had no aversion to daylight. During daylight hours they lurked within the forests of Kaff and hid their awful appearances beneath dark hoods.</p>
<p>The undead pirates were created long ago by the necromancer Alim Baybars .</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Mariners considered Kaff to be the safest island to sail near.</p>
