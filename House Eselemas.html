<p>House Eselemas was a tribe of yuan-ti known for their stealth and skill in battle. Yuan-ti from this house were called Eselemaa .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>Nine Eselemaa ruled Lushpool during the late 14 th century DR . These satraps held a majority over Lushpool's sixteen satrapies.</p>
<p>The majority of Eselemaa lived along the shores of the Lapal Sea and the northeastern region of the Mhair Jungles , with settlements forming a "hidden serpent" all the way to Lushpool.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>House Eselemas was the sworn enemy of House Se'Sehen , a feud stemming from rival claims to certain areas of the jungles surrounding the Lapal Sea. The Eselemaa allied themselves with House Jennestas , often fighting together against the Se'Sehen. The Coiled Cabal remained on good terms with the Eselemaa because of Lushpool's port access to Tharsult .</p>
