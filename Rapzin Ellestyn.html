<p>Rapzin Ellestyn was a sleazy drow merchant who ran his stall in Westgate 's underbelly – Undergate , in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Rapzin was a shifty and charismatic man with a shiny white smile that gleamed on his obsidian skin.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The drow's shop had a variety of authentic and not-so-authentic magic items and illicit goods, many of them – imported or even smuggled from other parts of Faerûn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point, before her exile from the Night Masks and the city of Westgate, Rinara , the Lady of Shivs, had some dealings with Rapzin Ellestyn, and upon her return, warned her companions to watch their purses around the drow merchant. In turn, Rapzin blamed that warning on Rinara's prejudice. Their past dealing was in smuggling and selling certain difficult-to-move items for a well-known criminal organization, presumably the infamous Night Masks.</p>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Rinara and her companions had to do business with the drow once again in order to acquire his anti-psion magic stone that Rapzin used in dealing with creatures that could read and affect his mind. The stone would later be used against the so-called Master of Undergate, psion Kajeel .</p>
