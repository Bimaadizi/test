<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Second Serôs War began in −8228 TS (−8298 DR) , with the war's combatants being the Kuo-Toan Consortiums and the sea elf empire of Aryselmalyr . The elves would rally the enslaved locathah against their masters, as well as various crabmen and merfolk . The war came to an end in −8212 TS (−8282 DR) , culminating in the destruction of the Consortiums as their cavernous cities were collapsed and the kuo-toans of the Inner Sea were indiscriminately slaughtered to near extinction. A great deal of the surviving kuo-toa of the nation would flee into the Underdark through the the Tunnels of Iratis , eventually founding the city of Leshnymul . Others were said to have escaped into the Underdark by entering through the depths surrounding the Aglarondan Peninsula .</p>
