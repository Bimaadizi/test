<p>Maskar Wands ( pronounced : /ˈ m æs k ɑːr ˈ w ɑː n d s / MASS-car WANN-ds ) was the patriarch of the Wands family in Waterdeep in 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Maskar was a conservative and traditionally minded individual. He greatly disapproved of the abuse of magic and its wasteful, unrestrained use, even sometimes chastising Khelben Arunsun .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1370 DR , Maskar was faced with theft of the family heirloom, the golden scarab beetle of Mulhorandi origin that was with the Wands family for generations. To Maskar's embarrassment and annoyance, the thief was Marcus Wands , a spoiled and opportunistic family member. To make the embarrassment even deeper, Marcus thought himself an adventurer and took the enchanted luck-giving statuette with him to Undermountain , losing it to a monster. Maskar was forced to ask for help from his "esteemed colleague" Khelben. The Blackstaff tasked his trusted agent with the recovery, eventually returning the artifact to its rightful owner..</p>
<p>In 1374 DR , he was among the many powerful mages Arunsun brought together in order to cleanse part of the High Moor and restore Faer'tel'miir , a lost city of Miyeritar .</p>
<p>In the year of the Gauntlet , He was also one of the staunch defenders of Waterdeep when Iakhovas led a Sahuagin attack on the city, when he lifted one gigantic sea serpent from the harbor, crushed it and incinerated it with a tremendous fireball . He threatened the attackers with swift death for their mistake in attacking the city. His arrival and that of other great champions of the city rose the morale of the the citizens, who desperately tried to drive the attack back.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Maskar was rarely seen. Occasionally, he took student wizards but asked for payment involving difficult, Art -related quests.</p>
