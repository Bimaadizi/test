<p>The main steeple of the Forested Enclave soared to a staggering 17 stories in height, allowing Amaunator's solar disk to be seen for miles in every direction.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Righteous Potentates within the temple had a fondness for casting continual light on their shaved scalps. This practice caused the gnolls of the nearby Facile Forest to make pilgrimages to the "lightened ones" and directed their raids elsewhere.</p>
