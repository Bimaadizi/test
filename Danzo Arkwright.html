<p>Danzo Arkwright was the dwarf in charge of the Sword Coast Couriers in the Rivington neighborhood of the Outer City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Danzo was a tan-skinned gold dwarf with blue eyes and chestnut hair. He kept his face clean-shaven.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Danzo Arkwright worked as the postmaster of the Sword Coast Couriers. However, his work was stressful as the region was affected by a looming threat of a war with the Cult of the Absolute , which led to some of the carriers being killed, letters being undelivered, and the loss of courier dogs . Trying to deliver letters in a timely manner, Danzo employed a small flock of carrier pigeons; however, that also proved to be a challenge when something started killing the birds off, and more letters were undelivered, including Danzo's personal correspondence. The said correspondence was Danzo's communications with Roah Moonglow , a Zhentarim cell's leader in Baldur's Gate. Danzo was to deliver an iron flask that was supposed to be smuggled into the city from the Waukeen's Rest Zhent cell for the Vanthampurs , and as that shipment was lost, the noble family was lost as a customer. Another letter was sent out to Gomwick , one of Danzo's couriers, but the warning message never reached the man. The reason for the pigeon mail disappearances was Tara , a Waterdhavian tressym , and a long-time companion of Gale Dekarios . The winged cat preyed on delicious pigeons and cared naught for the missing letters.</p>
