<p>Samril's Fine Blades was a weaponcrafting workshop in Secomber during the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Samril's Fine Blades was owned and operated by the Samril halfling family, and performed a wide range of tasks related to the crafting and assembly of weapons. It was linked by merchants' map to Arthane Furnace in Beliard who supplied raw blades, then sent them on to the Arthane Armory in Waterdeep for sale.</p>
<p>At Samril's, naked blades arrived and were sharpened with House of Yarthin whetstones and polished with mineral powders from Anastur's Abrasives . Duskwood and blueleaf wood was obtained from Maraszymo Darluth and other local woodcutters, dried in kilns by the Samrils, and then carved and fitted as weapon grips. Leather for wrapping the grips was sourced from Falthryn and Daughters Tannery and Sorkryn's Soft Hides of Scornubel , usually ox -hide or rothé -hide, with horse -hide and donkey -hide used if nothing else was available. The leather grips were secured with braided copper wire from Gleskur's Finemetals of Secomber . The pommels of their swords were usually round knobs affixed to the end of the tang, variously ivory , bone , or brass . Ivory was sourced from trustworthy passing merchants as available or special-ordered from Waterdeep, while a regular supply of hard-wearing peryton , owlbear , dire wolf , and fire lizard bone was obtained from Galdegut's Boneyard . Brass and other alloys used in the construction was supplied by local bulk merchants and worked on-site by the Samrils, while ivory and bone was carved into shape by young Samrils overseen by their elders. The finished blades were coated in vine oil , wrapped in canvas from local suppliers, and sealed in gum that the Samrils made from local lalannas vine and bitterthorn roots. They were then packed in crates and sealed with pitch before being sent to Waterdeep and the Arthane Armory.</p>
