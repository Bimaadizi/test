<p>Oman was a kingdom that comprised the whole of Oman's Isle as well as the northern coast of Gwynneth in the Moonshae Isles . It was sometimes known as the kingdom of Iron Keep in honor of the great fortress that was its seat of power. This realm collapsed when Oman's Isle was overrun by fomorians and cyclopes in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Oman was the largest, most populous, most prosperous, and most powerful among the Northmen realms of the Moonshaes as of the mid–14 th century DR . It was known to be peaceful within its own borders.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>By the mid–14 th century DR, the kingdom controlled all of Oman's Isle as well as the north coast of Gwynneth as far south as Highhome . Its capital was Iron Keep on the north shore of Oman's Isle.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Oman was ruled from Iron Keep by a king, who in turn presided over many subject kings across Oman's Isle. They projected their control over the northern shore of Gwynneth, where Northlander and Ffolk settlements alike fell under their jurisdiction. Their territory on Gwynneth nominally extended all the way to Highhome and the norther border of Myrloch Vale , however the kings were more interested in the coast and the sea than anything further inland.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Oman boasted the largest fleet of longships in the Moonshae Isles. This fleet was made more dangerous by the high level of coordination they could achieve in battle. In addition, Oman's armies were said to be the fiercest of the Moonshaes, with each minor king able to field as many as ten longship crews of 40 warriors or berserkers each.</p>
<p>Aside from raiding, the main concern of Oman's armies were the firbolgs of the Cambro Mountains , who threatened the realm's settlements on Gwynneth.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The people of Oman fished, farmed, raised livestock, and bred horses . Their main exports were goods and slaves seized in their raids against their Ffolk neighbors, timbers , and gold , much of which they traded for goods from the other Northlander isles. They were also known to trade with places like Ruathym and Waterdeep for the luxuries produced by more advanced societies. The port at Iron Keep was a major stop on the maritime trade routes with the Northlander isles to the north and lands as far as Waterdeep .</p>
<p>While there was little notable agriculture for export, the people of Oman were more equipped than most Northlander realms at feeding themselves, and did so by cultivating barley , potatos , and wheat and by breeding large herds of cattle , goats , sheep , and swine . They were also prolific hunters and fishers, although only the waters east of Oman's Isle boasted rich fishing grounds.</p>
<p>The shipwrights of Oman, particularly in Iron Keep, were said to be among the very best in the Northmen realms. They specialized in building longships, and their process involved the contributions of alchemists to make sealant , blacksmiths to make iron sockets and nails , ropemakers to twist ropes , and sewists to make the sails.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Oman shared much of the ancient history of the rest of the Moonshaes. In the 3 rd century DR, within a couple of generations of the coronation of Cymrych Hugh among the Ffolk of the Moonshaes, Illuskan raiders from Tuern and Gundarlun began attacking the Isles, and by the 10 th century, they had launched an invasion and had come to settle in five separate realms: Gnarhelm , the Korinn Archipelago , Norheim , Norland , and Oman. Like the other Northlander kingdoms, the Kingdom of Oman tended to scorn agriculture in favor of raiding the southern Moonshaes and the Sword Coast . The Iron Keep was erected atop an existing castle by Ffolk slaves and the settlement around it grew to nearly the size of Caer Callidyrr .</p>
<p>By the time that Elminster first visited the Moonsahes in the early-to-mid-14 th century DR, the Kingdom of Oman was the mightiest of the Northlander relams, and its ruler, Iron King Thelgaar Ironhand , had become one of the Northmen's greatest leaders. Thelgaar had assumed the throne around the turn of the 14 th century DR, and much of his realm's strength had been attributed to her personal accomplishments in uniting the lords in his domain into a united nation. He famously waged successful wars against the giants of the Grampalt Highlands , united the other kings of Oman's Isle under his leadership, and stamped out all organized resistance to his rule on Oman's Isle. King Thelgaar was killed and usurped by Kazgoroth on Mirtul 15 of the Year of the Saddle, 1345 DR , leading to the Darkwalker War .</p>
<p>Eventually, High King Tristan Kendrick brokered a peace between his Ffolk and the Northlanders under the Treaty of Oman in the Year of the Bright Blade, 1347 DR . Then in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , High Queen Alicia Kendrick of the Ffolk managed to unite her people and the Northlanders into the United Moonshae Isles , making good progress in merging the cultures of both peoples. Oman became the center of this new Northlander culture as the people gave up their lives of raiding others and instead became self-sufficient by farming, hunting and fishing—selling their longboats instead of using them to attack their neighbors. They also welcomed a great influx of settlers, including Ffolk.</p>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , it was said that Northlander raiders flying the colors of Iron Keep had begun to raid Ffolk settlements and merchants. It was unclear whether these were imposters or a return to tradition for the famously warlike Northlanders of Oman, and it was feared that mishandling of the situation by High Queen Alicia could push Oman into open revolt.</p>
<h3>Fall</h3>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR a group of fomorians from the Feywild , under the command of the evil Queen Connomae of Vor Thomil , invaded Oman through a gate in the Grampalt Highlands. Together with malevolent native giants (namely firbolgs ), they conquered the island, overrunning all Northlander and Ffolk villages, slaughtering the people, and ultimately toppling Iron Keep by Midsummer of that year. The remaining settlers on Gwynneth would ultimately be driven from the island by the fey of Sarifal in the early 15 th century DR.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Northlanders of Oman were among the most feared and warlike in the Moonshaes. Once peace had been established with the Ffolk, their aggressions turned toward Northlander raiders from outside the Moonshae Isles, most notably out of Ruathym .</p>
<p>Oman's towns were larger than most other Northlander communities, often numbering over a thousand inhabitants, and also tended to be wealthier and better fed.</p>
