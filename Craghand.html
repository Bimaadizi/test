<p>Lord Craghand was a roaming undying skeletal creature who once was a petty lord from the land of Unther in the Old Empires , long before the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In life, Lord Craghand possessed no talent with the Art and employed a small army of necromancers to compensate for the shortcoming. Under his command, the necromancers enchanted a handful of fiery morningstars – Bone Phoenixes . Craghand sought to immortalize his pet rule through dark necromantic spells. However, the magics were unsuccessful. Instead of making the lord immortal, Lord Craghand and his court became cursed with a strange form of undeath. They were turned into the so-called "Bone Phoenixes," undying skeletal creatures that roamed and menaced Faerûn . Every time these undead creatures perished or were slain by well-meaning heroes, they returned to undeath shortly after, doomed to endless accursed existence.</p>
