<p>Bright nagas were a relatively weak subspecies of naga .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bright nagas had reticulated, white-gold scales and bright eyes that burned with an almost hypnotic inner light. They were about 15 feet (4.6 meters) long and weighed about 500 pounds (230 kilograms). When angry, their scales would darken to red.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Bright nagas were intelligent and manipulative creatures that used traps to protect their lairs and to convince creatures to leave them in peace.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Bright nagas lacked the venomous fangs and innate magical talents of other nagas, instead only being able to mock-spellcast a single first-tier sorcerous spell at will. This spell was imprinted upon their mind and could not be changed; most bright nagas mock-casted magic missile , although others were known to mimic burning hands or color spray , among other spells. Bright nagas did have a talent for casting even when in melee combat, however.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>If forced into combat, bright nagas attacked only with their single spell or bit enemies. However, they used their labyrinthine lairs to their advantage, appearing and retreating over the course of—for their enemies—frustrating battles.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Bright nagas preferred to live in warm mountains. However, a bright naga was known to live in the first layer of Undermountain circa 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Due to their weaker abilities and lack of venom, bright nagas were said to be the result of genetic flaws or unfavorable breeding on the part of the "true nagas".</p>
