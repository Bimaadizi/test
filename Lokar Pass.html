<p>Lokar Pass was a pass through the Po Yul Dzayul Range in central Tabot . A road linking Draya and Ji ran through it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the forces of Shou Lung invaded Tabot in Shou Year 894 (−356 DR) , they seized the whole of northern Tabot, from Lokar Pass to Ko'Chung Gompa . With the fate of their nation hanging in the balance, artisans in Ji fashioned the five crystalline warriors and a group of great dang-ki and wu jen animated them and gave them magical abilities. On the third day of the fifth month, the ragged defenders of Tabot and their five crystalline warriors confronted the Shou Lung army as they marched out of Lokar Pass. Though the battle was terrific, they were victorious, and went on to reclaim all of the conquered lands.</p>
