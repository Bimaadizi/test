<p>Nerul was the Second Mate aboard the Vigilant circa 1374 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nerul was an older human male who eagerly served Captain Lastri Kassireh .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 1374 DR , Captain Lastri Kassireh and the Vigilant sailed from the Sword Coast to the nation of Samarach on the Chultan Peninsula . Onboard the ship were several passengers, including Volothamp Geddarm who traveled to meet with a wealthy yuan-ti merchant, Sa'Sani . The voyage was cursed with bad luck and numerous strange occurrences: food supplies were mysteriously spoiled; freshwater barrels ruptured; one of the crew, Kellen , got drunk and drowned; Volo almost got poisoned; and new ropes became frayed—in reality, sabotage.</p>
<p>While most of the crew's lives ended in a deadly storm, Nerul survived. The Vigilant's shipwreck was washed ashore not far from the city of Samargol , and Nerul was captured by a cannibalistic Batiri tribe under Chieftain Taelunangul 's rule.</p>
