<p>Burburs were a species of worm-like creatures.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Burburs were small creatures with soft, wet skin. They had large eyes and a proboscis which acted as the creatures mouth. A pair of legs grew just behind its head. It used these legs to move about, climb and provided the burbur with a limited ability to move small objects. They had a body odor that smelled like cinnamon .</p>
<h2>Behaviour</h2>
<p>Burburs were very docile creatures. They were solitary but occasionally a small group of burburs congregated to consume the same prey.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Burburs were totally immune to detritus effects of brown molds , green slimes , olive slimes , obliviax , russet molds , violet fungus , yellow molds , yellow musk creepers and zygoms . They were vulnerable to attacks by jellies and oozes, as well as poisonous gas and spell.</p>
<p>Burburs temporarily absorbed the effects of any mold, moss or slime it recently consumed. This acted as a deterrent to predators. Any predator who ate a burbur suffered from the negative effects of whatever was the last meal of the burbur, to usually fatal results.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Burburs consumed its prey by attacking it's proboscis to the body of their target. It continued feeding until the life drained from its prey.</p>
<h2>Habitat</h2>
<p>Burburs created small lairs that they used to rest or recover from injury. A burbur's lair was well hidden and often in the presence of a creature they were immune to. It was common to find a burbur living under the vines of a yellow musk creeper .</p>
<p>In the Crowded Sea region, they could be found on the island of Djinni's Claws .</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>Burburs had a unique diet. They fed exclusively on molds, mosses and slimes. Burburs were asexual creatures. They reproduced once a year via budding. A small bump would grow near it's tail, which slowly transformed into a second head. Gradually it grew legs and eventually split from the body, becoming a separate burbur.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>Burburs were kept as pets by many adventurers due to their abilities against molds, mosses and slimes. If a burbur was not fed once per day, it either tried to escape or attacked its owner. Due to their rarity and demand, they cost up to 1,000 gp each.</p>
