<p>Alaoreum River was a river that began in the Mountains of the Alaoreum , ran south along the shoreline of the Sea of Fallen Stars , and ended in Evenstar Lake .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The flooding of the Alaoreum River became ruinous for the settlement of Morningstar Hollows . It took several seasons for the land to become consumed by swamps and the inhabitants of Morningstar Hollows moved to the nearby town of Velorn's Valor . By the late-14 th century DR , the village was believed to be inhabited by a three dozen lizardfolk who claimed the abandoned human lands.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Scourge, 1150 DR , druids of Eldath and the Emerald Enclave clashed with undead armies of mohrg warlord Borran Klosk in service of Malar . The Battle of Morningstar Hollows concluded in the druids rising waters of Alaoreum River, flooding the undead and, eventually, trapped the mohrg beneath Alagh√¥n .</p>
<p>Borran Klosk was released from his prison in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR . Morningstar Hollows were taken by the creature's undead armies once more. Klosk used his necromancy to full his army with long-dead folk, murdered by the Emerald Enclave.</p>
<p>Over the centuries since Ironcloak 's ruination, just to the east from the river, numerous adventurers searched for the treasure cache of the town's lord. Alaoreum River was believed to hide the drowned cache. The treasure rained undiscovered as of the late-14 th century DR.</p>
