<h2>Relationships</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the Vaasan War began in the Year of the Bright Blade, 1347 DR , Donlevy recognized that Zhengyi the Witch-King was no ordinary foe, and that the war could only end in a bloodbath. Fearing this, he arranged for his two year-old son, Donlevy the Young , to go into hiding as a farmer's child, and then arranged a mock funeral to make sure his heir stayed hidden.</p>
<p>As Donlevy had predicted, after Zhengyi slew Damara's King, Virdin Bloodfeathers , at the Ford of Goliad in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , he sent assassins to slaughter the ruling families of the realm. Donlevy was killed, along with every single member of House Bel Maris save for the hidden heir. In Donlevy the Old's place, Zhengyi installed a puppet and pretender to the family lineage, Zorth Bel Maris .</p>
