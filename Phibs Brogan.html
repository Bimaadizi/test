<p>Phibs Brogan was a foppish patron of the Elfsong Tavern from the city of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Phibs was a fashionably dressed gold dwarven man. He had a dusky skin tone, dark brown eyes, and black hair. He kept his head clean-shaven and gathered the trimmed beared into a tied knot.</p>
<p>Notably, Phibs wore a red suit he purchased from Carm's Garm , a clothier located on the Wyrm's Crossing . Unfortunately, that outfit made him look a lot like Dolor , a Bhaalist serial killer dwarf.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Phibs Brogan was a frequent customer of the Elfsong Tavern in the Eastway neighborhood of Baldur's Gate. He attended the "Laff Riot" show at the Elfong, a stand-up comedy performance hosted by Harvard Willoughby in Elfsong's side room with a stage. Phibs was excited to see the show after his friend, Roanoke "almost pissed himself laughing." Phibs' expectations were high as Harvard Willoughby wore a monocle and anyone wearing one was good in the dwarf's book.</p>
