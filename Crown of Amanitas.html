<p>The Crown of Amanitas was a magical item of great power that allowed communication between one person and another over great distances.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The crown appeared to be made of unpolished silver that had shining metal leaves sprouting from it. It somewhat resembled a branch from a living tree. The crown had the ability to open a visual and vocal communication link between two parties, over a seemingly infinite range.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1358 DR , the famed Heroes of Ascore were called upon by the sage, Amanitas. Being able to rely on the heroes, he assigned them the mission of escorting the ambassadors of Neverwinter and Mirabar to Waterdeep . The ambassadors would stop in the Rutting Buck tavern in Leilon , and they would meet their hero-escorts there. Accordingly, Amanitas bestowed upon them the crown, as trouble would most likely brew on the way. The heroes set off on their mission, and used the Crown of Amanitas when encamped, in order to pass on and find out information from the sage, who was conducting work in Secomber .</p>
