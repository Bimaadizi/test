<p>Lalibela , also known as St. Lalibela , was a minor goddess or demigoddess of the nixies in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lalibela possessed incredible beauty and went naked.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The very sight of Lalibela unclothed could strike a mortal male dead except those she chose. And, unfortunately for everyone else, she didn't wear clothes.</p>
<p>Anyone who attacked her would suffer the blow themselves.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The sword Crusader could be used to commune with Lalibela.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , at a small, crystal-clear subterranean lake in the Deepearth region of the Underdark beneath Damara , Lalibela appeared to the paladin Gareth Dragonsbane , believing him to be of pure heart. Via telepathy , she bade him set aside his armor, weapons, and equipment, and walk across the lake. Rising out of the lake, she granted him the magic sword Crusader but spirited away his other weapons and tools before she sank back beneath the water. The weapon would be a great boon in his battles against demons , but if its wielder ever showed cowardice against them, it would return to Lalibela.</p>
