<p>Lakrissa was a tiefling from Elturel that resettled at the Emerald Grove along with others of her kin during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She had a flippant if not pessimistic outlook on life, to the point of wagering gold on the survival of her people.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Elturel was briefly pulled down to Avernus in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Lakrissa and other tieflings in the city were exiled from their home. Lakrissa joined the group under the leadership of Zevlor , who led them west towards Baldur's Gate .</p>
<p>When the group was forced to find shelter at the Emerald Grove due to rampant goblinoid attacks, Lakrissa served as sentry looking over the River Chionthar .</p>
<p>If the tiefling refugees managed to safely leave the Emerald Grove, then Lakrissa would join them on their journey towards Baldur's Gate. However, their convoy would be attacked in the Shadow-Cursed Lands by Absolute cultists. She and a small group of tiefling refugees would be taken prisoner and locked up under Moonrise Towers .</p>
<p>She was in a relationship with the bard Alfira and would go on to help her partner realize her dreams of starting a school of bards.</p>
