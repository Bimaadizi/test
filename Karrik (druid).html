<p>Karrik was a druid and a member of the Emerald Grove during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was a grateful man that felt shame when his group did not live up to their fullest.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Archdruid Halsin granted sanctuary to tieflings that were expelled from the city of Elturel following the Descent , but was subsequently called to action when he discovered mysterious goings on surrounding the newly-formed Cult of the Absolute . His departure led to the rise of leadership Kagha , a fellow druid that did not share Halsin's magnanimous nature. She called for the removal from the tieflings from the grove and the commencement of the Rite of Thorns , a ritual that would hide them away from the surrounding dangers of the Sword Coast.</p>
<p>While Karrik was one of the druids assigned to carry out the ritual he had strong misgivings about the entire situation.</p>
