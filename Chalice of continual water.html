<h2>Notable Chalices of Continual Water</h2>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in the midâ€“14 th century DR , a group of Ravenian adventurers found themselves transported from Toril to the planet Anadia . The adventurers saved a group of pacifist, philosopher Anadian halflings from a group of murderous plainsjans and umberhulks . Grateful for the rescue, the Anadians provided the adventurers a way back to Toril and gifted them a chalice of continual water that had been produced on Anadia. The chalice was made of fine silver and etched with a relief depicting their craggy mountain home, beneath the sun and a galleon spelljammer at its center.</p>
