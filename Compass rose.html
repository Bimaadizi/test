<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These small tracking devices had a piece shaped like a rose and a clear medallion with the cardinal directions clearly marked.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The rose was attached to any solid, nonliving surface, where it would send out a signal for up to 100 miles (160,000 meters). The medallion could trace the signal like a compass. A tiny arrow would appear on the medallion when traveling in the right direction. A simple command word was need to detach the rose.
