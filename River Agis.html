<p>The River Agis flowed from the east out of the Marching Mountains and into the Trackless Sea near the city of Memnon . The river was called the Memnon River in most of Tethyr.</p>
<p>It served as the border between Calimshan and Tethyr ever since the Eye Tyrant Wars .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The river was wide and slow-moving and very suitable for cargo-carrying barges and lumber. However, it did not receive as much traffic as would be expected owing to fears regarding Shoonach , as Port Agis , a section of Shoonach, also lay along the river upstream.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The river became the border between Tethyr and Calimshan in the Year of Recompense, −150 DR , when the syl-pasha of Calimport , Kamus el Tarshaj , ceded the lands of Monrativi Teshy Mir over to Tethyr—supposedly as a reward for Tethyr's assistance in the Eye Tyrant Wars more than a decade earlier.</p>
