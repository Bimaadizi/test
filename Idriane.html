<p>Idriane was a knight of Ilmater and one of two women to sit on ruling council of Impiltur , collectively known as the Lords of Imphras II , during the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Among the lords, Idriane served as a temperate voice that strived for moderation. This viewpoint existed in stark contrast to some of the more extreme perspectives that expressed by her fellow councilors.</p>
<p>Generally, Idriane and Rilaunyr coordinated with one another, constantly striving for understanding and consensus-building among the rest of the Impilturan lords, especially when the safety and well-being of the realm was at stake.</p>
