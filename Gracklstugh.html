<p>Gracklstugh ( pronounced : /ˈ g r ɑː k ʊl s t uː g / GRAK-ul-stoog ), the City of Blades , was a duergar city on the shores of the Darklake in the Northdark .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The city was located five miles beneath the Evermoors , as well as beneath the Dessarin River valley and the Uthgardt ancestor mound Flintrock .</p>
<p>Gracklstugh was located about 100 miles away from Menzoberranzan across the Darklake and beyond.</p>
<p>Access to Gracklstugh could be achieved by the following routes: caves in the Sword Mountains ; tunnels from Beldabar's Rest in Yartar ; tunnels from Luskan and Mithral Hall ; and via a major trade route from Skullport through the Labyrinth .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Gracklstugh was a cavern city that sloped down on the eastern side to join the Darklake as a subterranean port. The city was lit by the firelight of smelters and foundries mingling among stalagmites. The air smelled acrid and was filled with industrial sounds: fire, steam, and iron ringing. The persistent smog that filled the cavern could cause a persistent and sometimes fatal cough, known as grackle-lung .</p>
<p>Laduguer's Furrow , also known as "the Cleft," split the city in half north-south. Bridges connected the higher city to the lakeside districts. The west side was off-limits to foreigners.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gracklstugh was founded in −3717 DR by duergar escaping the fall of Deep Shanatar and the subsequent enslavement of many gray dwarves in Oryndoll .</p>
<p>In −3392 DR , King Horgar Steelshadow II began uniting the duergar clans in and around Gracklstugh, creating the Deepkingdom . Over the past few centuries, however, the Deepkingdom narrowing its reach to the city itself and its close environs.</p>
<p>The Deepkingdom's might began falling during the Deepbear Battles against the quaggoths from −1803 DR to ca. −1350 DR .</p>
<p>Around the 14 th century DR, King Tarngardt Steelshadow (grandfather of Horgar Steelshadow IV ; king since 972 DR ) was manipulated and controlled by the Council of Savants. Upon his demise, Horgar IV took the throne but recognized the threat of the savants and planned to kill or at least expel all the derro in Gracklstugh.</p>
<p>In 1372 DR , Horgar used the Silence of Lolth and the weakness of the followers of Lolth as an excuse to attack the drow city of Menzoberranzan and thus cement his power over his lairds. He allied with Nimor Imphraezl of the Jaezred Chaulssin to further his goals. Under his prompting, Horgar led his army to success against the drow at the Pillars of Woe and gained additional allies: the Scourged Legion of Kaanyr Vhok and the traitorous drow House Agrach Dyrr , also aligned with the Jaezred Chaulssin. Referred to as the Siege of Menzoberranzan , the allies then marched against the drow city and besieged it for several months.</p>
<p>On Ches 28, 1373 DR , the Silence of Lolth ended and Lolth's priestesses regained their powers. Kaanyr Vhok subsequently recalled his forces to Hellgate Keep ; the remaining duergar were easily defeated and turned back. The siege officially ended on Ches 30.</p>
<p>As the duergar army retreated, Nimor swept in and killed Horgar Steelshadow IV.</p>
<p>Following Horgar IV's death, Horgar Steelshadow V ascended to the throne.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The city was mainly home to duergar, but there was a sizable minority of derro who lived there, as well as a number of durzagon, orogs, and stone giants. A third of the total population consisted of slaves, namely goblins, shield dwarves, orcs, svirfneblin, and humans.</p>
<p>The city hosted many visiting merchants, especially drow, duergar, and kuo-toa . Foreigners were required to obtain writs of passage for passage through the city (beyond the docks district) and its territories. On the black market, Clan Muzgardt provided writs of passage for 200 gold per person.</p>
<p>The major clans of Gracklstugh were:</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The nobility of the city were divided into clans, whose lords were called lairds . Power in the city was shared between the great clans (especially the merchant clans), the king (called Deepking ), and the city's derro savants. Entities holding power were the Council of Lairds , the derro Council of Savants , Clan Cairngorm (a power clan of stone giants), and the Merchant Council .</p>
<h2>Military</h2>
<p>The army of Gracklstugh was one of the strongest in the Underdark although the duergar lacked arcane or divine casters. Militia service was a requirement for all adult males, although many females also trained. Other products of the city were metal armor, arrowheads , fish , locks, mining equipment, smithing equipment, and other tools. In 1372 DR the army that marched against Menzoberranzan was composed of 5,000 duergar in more than eight companies, with orc and ogre slaves.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Gracklstugh was especially well known for its quality weapons. Other products of the city were metal armor, arrowheads, fish, locks, mining equipment, smithing equipment, and other tools.</p>
<p>The city had good trading relationships with Menzoberranzan (except in times of war), Mantol-Derith , Skullport, Sshamath , and Ooltul .</p>
<p>Clan Muzgardt was a clan of merchants that made and traded ales and liquors.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<h3>Outlook</h3>
<p>The duergar were generally serious and somber and not friendly towards non-duergar, although there were many non-duergar in the city.</p>
<p>To outsiders they could be ruthless and contemptuous, but were by nature pragmatic in their dealings with others. Duergar were far more interested in using others to their advantage, such as enslaving them, rather than killing them.</p>
<p>Duergar believed strongly in the ethic of hard work and tended to prefer earning success and status through labor rather then scheming against a rival.</p>
<p>It was claimed that the duergars' second love after gold was ale.</p>
<p>Coins from Gracklstugh were minted the face of the current duergar monarch on one side, and the mind flayer skull symbol of Deep Duerra on the other, with the dwarvish phrase "As low as we can go" on the rim of the coin.</p>
<h3>Food</h3>
<p>Food in Gracklstugh included rothe roasts, red wine, smoked rothe cheese, and black sporeflour bread.</p>
