<p>Zarif was a small town located on Dihl al-Taif in Zakhara in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Zarif was surrounded in every direction by hundreds of miles of scorching desert.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Since it was the only place within reasonable distance along Dihl al-Taif to rest and procure water and supplies, Zarif gouged the prices of their wares. This served to bring animated displays of bargaining between caravan masters and local merchants among the caravanserais surrounding the town.</p>
