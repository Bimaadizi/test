<p>Fang golems were a bestial form of golems composed of claws, fangs, tusks, and the like from various creatures.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These golems were always designed to resemble some form of wild beast, which made them very diverse in both shape and size. For example, one could be constructed to resemble a giant crab , incorporating pincers and shark teeth into their makeup. The size of a fang golem was comparable to that of a dire animal , usually measuring 8​ to ​15 feet (2.4​ to ​4.6 meters) in length, and weighing upwards of 2,000 pounds (910 kilograms).</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>These golems were devoid of sentience, mindlessly following whatever orders were issued to them. They were incapable of coming up with their strategies or tactics, only following to the letter the instructions given to them. Due to their mindless nature, it was impossible to intimidate or provoke them, though if attacked they would respond in kind.</p>
<p>Fang golems were not solely devoted to their creators, but rather were capable of being commanded to obey the orders of another and that person in turn could command the golem to follow the commands of another. Additionally, they could even be commanded to govern their own actions in their master's absence. The creator of a fang golem could resume their absolute control over it at anytime by simplying commanding the construct to follow solely their orders.</p>
<p>When a fang golem went some time without being commanded, it would relentlessly following whatever last instruction was issued to it, to the best of its ability.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Fang golems were impervious to most forms of energy-based attacks or spells and resistant to cold-based ones, but could be harmed by sonic-based ones, such as shout , greater shout , and orb of sound . They could see in areas of low-light as well as total darkness .</p>
<p>These golems could only receive orders if their masters were both audible and visible within 60 feet (18 meters) of them.</p>
<p>Fang golems could fire a barrage of spikes from their bodies, out to 80 feet (24 meters), up to five times per day. Additionally, any creature a fang golem harmed would become more susceptible to druid spells and fey abilities for a period of one minute.</p>
<p>A fang golem's body exploded upon being slain, sending the animal parts they were composed of out to 20 feet (6.1 meters) and potentially causing significant harm to anyone caught within the blast radius.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>These golems were typically created by either evil druids, to terrorize local pockets of civilization or guard their unholy druidic grove, or occasionally by powerful fey. Depending upon their shape, a fang golem could also act as a mount in noncombat situations. Non-evil druids considered this type of golem abominable and typically saw fit to destroy them, as well as their creators.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Fang golems could be found in practically any form of environment that a creator saw fit, including underwater or hostile areas like volcanic caverns. However, because they were typically created by evil druids they were usually found in the forbidding places befitting them, such as corrupted forests, haunted wastelands, and underground tunnels.</p>
<h3>Creation</h3>
<p>Assembling a fang golem required 1,000​ to ​2,000 pounds (450​ to ​910 kilograms) worths' of various fangs, claws, tusks, and the like. These animal parts would then be bound by cords or strips of animal hide to wood laths. These laths all had to be treated with preservative oils, costing around 500 gold pieces . Assembling these collections of animal parts could require killing a great deal of creatures, though this was not a requirement and the parts could be obtained by any means. Once the body of a fang golem was assembled a spirit had to be bound into its form. This final step of the creation process called for casting the spells greater magic fang , reincarnate , and spike stones .</p>
<p>The total cost of assembling a fang golem was at a minimum 8,000 gold pieces, whilst acquiring one or paying someone else for its creation could cost 15,000 gp.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR , when the Rotting Man terrorized the Rawlinswood in the Great Dale area, his minions constructed a number of fang golems from their stronghold of Dun-Tharos . They often acquired the necessary components for their construction from the remains of wildlife that were killed by corrupted ones' advance.</p>
