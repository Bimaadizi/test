<p>Peral was a clinging vine plant and a weed hated by farmers and gardeners of Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Peral was a fast-growing vine that enveloped and choked other plants to death. The vine was so dangerous to the plant life that only trees thicker than 1 foot (0.3 meters) in diameter could survive. Despite being a weed, peral sap was useful. It was sticky and sweet and was used in cooking in a similar manner to honey and as a type of adhesive . The sap was strong enough to keep paper envelopes sealed and similar small items. However, it crystalized and crumbled to dust within a week.</p>
<p>Peral sap was expensive as the vines were difficult to cultivate. They produced sap only when grown near other plants and allowed to choke them and only after three seasons of sprouting and strangulations.</p>
