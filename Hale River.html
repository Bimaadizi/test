<p>The Hale River was a waterway in the east of ancient Netheril .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The river was formed by runoff from the Gods' Legion Mountains (later known as the Desertsmouth Mountains ) and flowed due west through the city of Opus and into the southeastern tip of Basin Lake (later known as the Bowl of Loneliness .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The river's course was dramatically altered by an earthquake in −3116 DR , resulting in the flooding of a nearby valley that would become Basin Lake.</p>
<p>Numerous farms lined the river during the Silver and Golden Age of Netheril . While the river still flowed as of the Fall of Netheril , it was subsequently consumed by the growing Anauroch desert and was long gone by the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Among those who dwelt along the river during the ancient Empire of Netheril, there was a druid who was ultimately cursed by a Netherese archmage into becoming the first of the aballin .</p>
