<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Those who were struck a non-lethal blow by the sword had a chance of being inflicted with wererat lycanthropy. In addition, the wielder could summon and control a horde of rats, or a small number of giant rats.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first noted appearance of Calathangas in Faer√ªn was in the hands of the Battledalesman warrior Rathinor in the late 13 th century DR . In the years when the Dalelands were hit with a devastating plague, Rathinor fell in combat while driving off a band of thieves . It disappeared for about 15 years, before a peasant sold it to a ruthless soldier named Xerastos , for the price of six sheep. Xerastos' renown as a combatant grew quickly, due in no small part to his prowess with the cursed blade. A decade later, Calathangas exchanged hands again as Xerastos was killed by a paladin who sought to destroy the then-infamous blade. Unfortunately, the paladin fell ill before completing his quest and the sword had not been encountered since.</p>
