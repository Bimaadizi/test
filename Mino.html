<p>Mino was a druid and a member of the Emerald Grove circa the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Mino was averse to risk and not quite as compassionate as some of his fellow druids.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Aelar served under Archdruid Halsin , alongside Rath , Apikusis , Aelar , and the link-minded Jeorna .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Halsin left the Emerald Grove in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , he placed Kagha in a role of temporary leadership. Kagha had the druids begin the Rite of Thorns , a ritual that would hide the grove away from outsiders and protect it from goblinoid raiders associated with the growing cult of the Absolute . Mino wholly supported this strategy as he felt their isolation from the rest of the Sword Coast would ensure their continued security.</p>
