<p>Bolifaena , also known as Bolfae , was a yochlol hadndmaiden of Lolth in the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Shattered Oak, 1313 DR , a mission by House Hunzrin outside Menzoberranzan led by Du'Quelve Hunzrin met two priestesses, Iccara and Bolfae, who said they'd come from the previously unknown Arach Enclave . Matron Arolina ordered Du'Quelve to secretly transport the two priestesses to her. However, a mission headed by Beniago and Zaknafein Do'Urden was following them. Iccara promised to Du'Quelve a load of arandur and the service of a deep gnome slave, Symvyn Rivenstone . However, Iccara and Bolfea had their own mysterious plans in mind. Iccara and Bolfea knew the plans of all the players and planned to play all the factions against each other.</p>
<p>Some time later, Du'Quelve went with Iccara to the meeting with the deep gnome and forced him to dispel the wards of the gnome's outpost. However, Zaknafein , Jarlaxle , and Kimmuriel Oblodra suddenly arrived and in the fighting Iccara and Bolfea were revealed to be yochlols. Kimmuriel identified Bolfea as the handmaiden Bolifaena and forced her to retreat to the Abyss . In the end, Zaknafein destroyed Iccara, injured Du'Quelve, and freed Symvyn.</p>
<p>In later years, Du'Quelve's career stagnated despite her claim of having been in league with two yochlols, as all knew she had only been tricked by the handmaidens.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Matron Yvonnel Baenre summoned Bolifaena and the handmaiden made a complete report of the matter to her.</p>
