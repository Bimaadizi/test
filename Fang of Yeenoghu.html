<p>A Fang of Yeenoghu was a gnoll that had been been possessed by a demonic spirit, a gift bestowed upon them by the demon lord Yeenoghu . They were considered the Lord of Savagery's most favored servants.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Whenever a Fang of Yeenoghu slew another creature, the victim's corpse could in a sense birth new gnolls. Any hyena that feasted upon the remains of a Fang's prey would initiate a horrific transformation. The hyena's body would burst open, and a fully-grown mature gnoll would emerge from its viscera. This frightful metamorphosis reflected the moment when the first gnolls were spawned by Yeenoghu himself.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Fangs of Yeenoghu often wielded 'cudgels of bloody teeth', massive greatclubs studded with teeth that seeped blood.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Yeenoghu's chosen garnered further favor from the demon lord by capturing mortals as slaves and dragging them down to his domain in the Abyss . They often served as shamans that presided over rituals dedicated to the Prince of Gnolls.</p>
