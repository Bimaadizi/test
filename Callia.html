<p>Princess Callia was a member of the le Shay royalty of Sarifal until her death in the mid-to-late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like other members of her family, Callia had a tattoo of the le Shay royal symbol: a climbing rose known as the Rose of Sarifal . Each such tattoo had a unique color, and her rose was white. It was said to be located on her backside.</p>
<p>She loved to eat ortolans .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Callia was the mother of the High Lady Ordalf , the founder and Queen of Sarifal. By the end of Callia's life, her daughter hated her, and thought of her as a " whore " for having fallen in love and borne a child with a non-le Shay. That child was Amaranth , whose father was a simple and upstanding Llewyrr elf , a Knight of Synnoria , and brother of Lord Mindarion of Synnoria .</p>
<p>Because of the intense importance placed on the "purity" of the le Shay bloodline, Ordalf's son (and Callia's grandson), Prince Araithe , had desired to sire a child with Callia. However, she rebuffed him.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Callia was many thousands of years old by the time of her death in the 15 th century DR. Her elder daughter, Ordalf, was at least eleven millennia old at the time.</p>
<p>Following the death of Ordalf's father—ostensibly from venereal disease —Callia had a child with a Llewyrr elf in the late 1450s DR. By this time, she had already spurned her grandson Ariathe's advances, and when he discovered that she had a child with an elf, he had both her and her lover hunted down and killed in his jealous rage. He subsequently brought their seven-year-old daughter, Amaranth, to his base at Citadel Umbra with the intention of grooming his young aunt to become a future mother of his children.</p>
<p>Prior to her death, Callia was promised by one of Amaranth's caretakers, Valeanne , to protect the girl if anything happened to her.</p>
