<p>A curse was a powerful, negative magical effect placed upon a person, place, or object.</p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>Curses could have a wide variety effects, but often involved weakening, injuring, or thwarting the intentions of an afflicted individual or destabilizing an afflicted item.</p>
<p>In general, a curse was hard to remove. Only a handful of specialized spells —such as remove curse —could hope to remove even a weak curse. A more powerful curse needed great power to remove, if it was possible to remove at all. The fancy stone tremair , when worn next to the skin, was believed to grant immunity from all magical curses.</p>
<h2>Types of Curses</h2>
<h3>Spell Curses</h3>
<p>The most fundamental curse was the one created by the spell bestow curse . Other common spell curses were bestow greater curse , curse water , geas/quest , hex , Laeral's crowning touch , and lesser geas .</p>
<h3>Item Curses</h3>
<p>Any mundane or magical item could become a cursed item , and pass that curse onto individuals who possessed the item. Often, this type of item was created as a trap by an individual, an accident, or the decay of time.</p>
<p>Cursed weapons would bind themselves to a wielder, forcing them to fight to the death or otherwise preventing the wielder from getting rid of the weapon.</p>
<h3>Family Curses</h3>
<p>This type of curse often started as one of the other types, but changed over time to affect the whole family of a cursed individual. In some rare cases, a powerful curse could be put on a whole family.</p>
<h3>Divine Curses</h3>
<p>This type of curse was inflicted on a person, place or thing in accord with a god 's ethos. They were always powerful and often spectacular. A primary example was the Curse of Mystra , which afflicted any individual who willfully copied the sigil of a mage with the intent to impersonate that mage.</p>
<h3>Undeath</h3>
<p>The existence of undead was sometimes considered a curse on life.</p>
<h3>Warlock's Curses</h3>
<p>Some warlocks had the ability to bestow minor curses onto their foes in battle, which made the afflicted targets more vulnerable to the warlock's attacks and magics.</p>
