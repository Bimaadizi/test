<p>Mestel was an old and powerful merchant organization and a noble family from the city of Arrabar in the Vilhon Reach who controlled a significant share of all the trade that moved through Chondath .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>House Mestel was one of the oldest and most powerful merchant families of Arrabar. The oldest families held nine-tenth of the city's wealth while the younger merchant houses, such as House Matrell , fought for the one-tenth share of the market. The estate of the Mestel family was a sprawling high-spired mansion surrounded by a grove of suth trees planted along the estate's perimeter. Like all other mercantile houses of Arrabar, Mestels housed a sizable mercenary and guard force.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Obiron Matrell was born in the Year of the Wandering Waves, 1292 DR to one of the lordlings of the great Mestel family of Arrabar. Mestels denounced the distant-born bastard and left him no choice but to change his name and establish his own merchant organization â€“ House Matrell. Even after Obiron, along with his wife Hetta , built a small merchant empire, House Matrell was still looked down upon by Mestels.</p>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Falagh Mestel became involved in a plot against House Matrell.</p>
