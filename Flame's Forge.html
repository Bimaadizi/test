<p>Flame's Forge was a significantly oversized enchanted tower shield that originated from a lost tomb in Anauroch .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Flame's Forge not only protected its owner from physical attacks like any other shield, but also made them resistant to heat and fire-based abilities and spells.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A thief whose name was lost to history uncovered Flame's Forge in one of the tombs in the scorching sands of Anauroch. The thief was able to survive the desert thanks to the colossal shield's enchantments. Later, the same thief returned to Anauroch armed with the Forge and a small gang of bandits to prey on travelers and merchant caravans traveling through the hot sands. The raiding continued for months until the thief was slain not far from the tomb that Flame's Forge was recovered from.</p>
<p>By 1372 DR , Flame's Forge reached the blacksmith Derval Ironeater of Daggerford , where the enchanted shield was available for purchase.</p>
