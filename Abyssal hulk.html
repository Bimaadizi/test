<p>Abyssal hulks were a warped offshoot species of umber hulks native to the Abyss .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Unlike the standard umber hulk of the Prime Material , these creatures had acidic blood that they were able to spew out at their enemies. And their gaze had a psychic quality to it, being capable of inducing madness in others and temporarily charming them into attacking others.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Abyssal hulks could be found across different layers of the Abyss, burrowing through them and sometimes creating new passages.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>The minions of the demon lord Yeenoghu gathered a great many of these creatures and forced them into service as guardians and watchers. These abyssal hulks lurked beneath the ground along well-traveled paths in the Abyss, waiting to rise up and attack passersby.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Legends claimed that these creatures came about when some of the earliest umber hulks dug so deep that they ventured into other planes , such as the Elemental Chaos , and found the Abyss to be a teeming hunting ground. Such legends would go on to say that many of these umber hulks died, but those who survived to feast upon the flesh of demons were warped over time.</p>
