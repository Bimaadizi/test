<p>Urgutha Forka was a vicious demon that once spread a virulent plague in ancient times before the ancestors of the drow fled to the Underdark . The surface elves denied the existence of Urgutha Forka, preferring to blame the drow. The drow, when realizing they were immune to the lethal plague, enlisted Urgutha as an ally.</p>
<p>The saying "been yet not been" was a line from a longer drow tale insulting the surface elves who had lost thousands to a demon they refused to admit existed.</p>
