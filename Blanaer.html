<p>Blanaer was a village in the Vast in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It was located on the Cross Road between Kurth and Thindilar . The Pass Trail led from it to Tavilar .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Blanaer was a stopover village home to hardworking farmers. It was a local agricultural center, with a market for selling sheep and cattle from nearby farms, paddocks to hold stock, and piles of manure for sale. "Stinks like Blanaer" was a common expression in the Vast. It was fairly unexciting.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>However, in the early and lawless years of human settlement of the Vast, bandits battled openly along the Cross Way near where Blanaer later arose.</p>
<p>Over the course of a decade in the mid-1300s DR , on a number of mornings, bodies were discovered hanging from trees beside the roads around Blanaer. These were likely thieves who'd been caught by their intended target.</p>
<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>Despite Blanaer's reputation, it had local treasure tales like many other communities in the Vast. On occasion, chests, buckets , saddlebags , and nosebags stuffed with coins were unearthed in Blanaer's pastures, stockyards, and even manure piles, and more finds were expected, though they were usually well defended by herds of cattle. Supposedly, these treasures were hastily buried by thieves on the run, from either their victims or their former partners, and by metal merchants from Kurth being pursued by bandits.</p>
