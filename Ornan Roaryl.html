<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ornan was a red-faced, rugged but aging man.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The common people of Eskorn loved their king, and believed that any setback suffered in the kingdom was the work of his opposition or of evil outsiders. Eskornar nobility, however, didn't held King Ornan in high regard and wanted to either put his daughter, Dlorna Roaryl , as the new Queen of Eskorn, or to usurp the throne, as was the case of the nobles led by Amaunthur Sardron .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Under his rule, King Ornan traveled across Eskorn, bringing his justice across the realm. He was a harsh judge, executing murderers and flogging thieves while proclaiming their crimes. Those who didn't deserved to die were put to work under his knights' services. While he was traveling, he left his servant, Mreskan Haundle , to serve as his seneschal in Stormhelm . He used the Seeing Stones to communicate with Mreskan whenever was needed.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>King Ornan was a three times widower who had three children: princes Imrar Roaryl and Flandarr Roaryl , and princess Dlorna Roaryl.</p>
