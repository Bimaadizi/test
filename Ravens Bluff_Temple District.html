<p>The Temple District of Ravens Bluff was an important and very wealthy region of the city, home to a great many of its noble families , merchant houses , , shops and businesses, and finer mansions and estates. Within its borders were the grand and imposing Ravendark Castle , which overlooked the city's Harbor District , the city's courthouse and prison, the Nevin Street Compter (which was actually located on Westwall Way ), and the Realms-famous Ravenian playhouse .</p>
<p>The district had four distinct neighborhoods. While they were all fairly wealthy and prosperous, each was defined by its own unique characteristics.</p>
<h2>Organizations</h2>
<p>The knights of Ravens Bluff had a strong presence within the Temple District. Their main headquarters, the Hall of the Raven , was located in Altarside , while the Roost housed the Knights of the Golden Rooster in Gowntown, and Griffon Hall housed the Knights of the Griffon .</p>
<h2>Neighborhoods</h2>
<h3>Gowntown</h3>
<p>This neighborhood was the safest and perhaps the most wealthy neighborhood in the Temple District. The City Watch maintained heavy patrols down Raphiel Road and Blacktree Boulevard to protect the many priests returning to their luxury apartments, such as those in Hengelhouse . Not even the city's great many adventurers were brazen enough to brandish even holstered weapons in this locale.</p>
<h3>Holyhouses</h3>
<p>While not quite as affluent as Gowntown, the Holyhouses neighborhood contained some of the city's most spectacular architecture, featured in the locale's many temples, most notably the Silver Halls and the Tower of Holy Revelry . Adding to the luxuriousness and beauty were the many palatial manors and noble estates, such as Ondrelspires and Elderstars . The numerous Guildhalls on Manycoins Way and De Villars Ride lent a great amount of wealth and activity to the local hustle and bustle.</p>
<h3>Swordspoint</h3>
<p>A more modest and business-oriented region of the district, Swordspoint featured a great many stores and specialty shops, such as the famous-but-exploded magic shoppe Chemcheaux , restaurants that were beloved throughout the Bluff like the Kettle of Many Things , and even a beauty salon that offered tattoos to their clientele. It was an immensely popular destination for sightseers from out of town, who could stroll through the Bluff's largest city park , and it was a sprawling shopping plaza of sorts for Ravenian citizens.</p>
<h3>Altarside</h3>
<p>Altarside was perhaps the busiest of the district's neighborhoods, as it housed a massive imposing castle , a playhouse that attracted performers from throughout the city and across Faer√ªn , a gallery and boutique for Ravenian artists, and a delightful little gnomish bakery . On the west side of the neighborhood, the massive bronze Gates of the Watchful Raven opened up to the Seaglimpse neighborhood in the Harbor District .</p>
