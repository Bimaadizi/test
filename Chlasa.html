<p>Chlasa was a woman in Hastarl during the mid-3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the attack on Athalgard led by Elminster Aumar on the Year of the Chosen, 240 DR , Chlasa was rutting with local nobleman Jansibal Otharr at the moment when the alarm was rung by the Magelords of Athalantar . The dandy left her somewhat late, worrying that he may be looked on in disfavor for disregarding the alarm at first; she stayed in bed, though he warned her to go easy on the wine.</p>
