<p>Eommar was an inhabitant of Port Llast and loyal customer of the Alliance Arms Inn in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Eommar was an aging human man with white hair and beard.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Eommar could often be found in the Alliance Arms Inn, drunkenly leering at women. He joyously greeted strangers and asked them to buy him a drink because "the end was coming." He was referring to a recent development. As of 1374 DR, the streets of Port Llast were frequented by walking undead every night, which Eommar saw as an ill omen. To an especially friendly drinking buddy, someone who would spend coin on the old drunk, Eommar was willing to reveal that he heard one of the wandering undead creatures speak. The undead chanted "Last Port," Port Llast's name from ten generations past. Eommar believed that it was the curse of Last Port's last noble line, the Adreum Curse.</p>
