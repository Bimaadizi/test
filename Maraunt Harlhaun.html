<p>Maraunt Harlhaun was the patriarch of the Harlhaun merchant family in Delzimmer until at least the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR . The Harlhauns were one of four families that ruled Delzimmer just because they were rich and powerful.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Harlhauns were generally tall, thin, and attractive, and Maraunt was no exception, though he was getting on in years.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Maraunt was an avid alchemist that enjoyed creating new scents for the perfume makers. He also developed drugs with mild or subtle effects, which he often mixed with his scents or adapted the natural odor of the drug into a perfume.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>After the death of his wife, Maulauke , Maraunt started to rely on his daughter and eldest child Arleithe to be the chatelaine of the manor—a role she resented.</p>
