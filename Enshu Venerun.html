<p>Enshu Venerun was a werewolf servant of Selûne , who was part of the New Moon Pact in the 8 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Enshu was a stout woman, with a large scar across her face and strong hands.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Enshu served Selûne as a werewolf of the New Moon Pact, fighting against the faith's enemies in the same darkness they lurked in. In 757 DR , the High Moonmistress Brima Chintamn of Bright Lady's Tower in Chancelgaunt declared the New Moon Pact a heresy, and Enshu was among those targeted. She was slain attempting to avoid capture by the church 's forces.</p>
<p>When Feena Archwood investigated the mystery of the New Moon Pact in 1373 DR , Enshu's spirit appeared in her dreams alongside the other members of the Pact to defend and guide her. After she uncovered Velsinore 's heresy and they mutually slew each other, Feena's spirit was met by a Shard escort to the afterlife, but the spirits of the Pact members encouraged her to return to life and join the New Moon Pact herself. With the aid of Julith Harkspur 's healing, Feena was revived and ultimately continued the legacy of the Pact.</p>
