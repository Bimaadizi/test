<p>Ring mail was a type of heavy armor used on Toril .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ring mail was leather armor with large, weighted rings attached to it. Despite having a leather base, this sort of armor was classified as heavy. Its rings helped to reinforce the base against axe or sword strikes. It was inferior to chain , splint , and plate mail . However, it was a lot cheaper than the other suits of heavy armor, i.e. , fifty times less expensive than plate mail. It was cheaper and provided more defense than studded leather armor, for those who were not so dexterous.</p>
<p>Warhorses could don such armor, and again it was the cheapest option.</p>
