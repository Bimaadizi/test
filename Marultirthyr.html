<p>Marultirthyr was a temple dedicated to Deep Sashelas in the Elves' Quarter of Myth Nantar .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>This temple was a five-story structure, with a three-story domed central altar. The structure was composed of translucent pearled glass walls and coral. On the interior underside of the dome was a fresco depicting Deep Sashelas as a handsome aquatic elf , surrounded by a school of dolphins . The temple as a whole was an example of the craftmanship of the late Aryselmalyr period.</p>
<p>Like all temples of Deep Sashelas in Serôs , Marultirthyr had a specially-marked nave containing a gate linked to the other temples. Activating this gate required one to utter the name of the temple they wished to visit and then whirl in place five times.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By 1370 DR , Marultirthyr was among the few sites in the Elves' Quarter not to be compromised by the thick, overgrown sheathes of cryscoral that dominated much of the quarter.</p>
<p>In the 15 th century DR , this temple was in a state of disrepair due to recent attacks on the city by sahuagin . This included part of the structure's coral dome having collapsed atop the area where weekly sermons were usually held by the cleric Iridan Danlianthol .</p>
