<p>The Cavern of Cloven Heads was an ancient cavern, first inhabited by Clan Black Axe , which was close to Ched Nasad .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The cavern was inhabited by the dwarves of Clan Black Axe , who mined iron and worshiped Dumathoin. In the early -3900s DR, the clan battled against the high priestess, Menzoberra , and her drow group. Despite the drow winning the battle, the dwarves managed to kill half of the entire drow force. Due to the amount of drow heads that fell to ground, the cavern site became known as "the Cavern of the Cloven Heads".</p>
<p>The dwarves later returned, and inscribed glyphs onto the rocks, detailing the battle of the "Brave Beards", ancestors of their clan, and the drow. They erected a cairn to the dwarven warriors who fell during the battle. The clan were forced to leave again, as Ammarindar collapsed overhead.</p>
<p>Around 1370 DR , the cavern was occupied by Uthgardt grimlocks of the Golden Eagle and the Red Pony tribes, who came to worship the cairn of the "Brave Beards".</p>
