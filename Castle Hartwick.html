<p>Castle Hartwick was the home of the royal family of Hartsvale and the seat of its throne.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Castle Hartwick was located on an island in the center of the Clear Whirl River east of the town of Hartwick and west of the village of Stagwick . The island was a sheer spire of granite , hundreds of feet above the water, and was covered in spruce trees. Two drawbridges, one on the west and one on the east, provided access to the island.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The castle itself was constructed from whitened blocks of granite, and the castle included several flying turrets.</p>
<p>One of the gates to the castle, located on the west side of the structure, was known as the Giants' Gate, and this provided true giants with a means to have an audience with the reigning king or queen.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Within the throne room of Castle Hartwick sat the Alabaster Throne , which had been a gift from the dwarves of the area.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Besides the defense of being built on an island, the turrets of the castle contained ballistae . The drawbridges to the castle were also defended by members of the Giant Guard , who were all giants sent by the surrounding giant tribes as ambassadors to the Kingdom of Hartsvale.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The castle was still under construction when Hartkiller , Annam All-Father 's last son and the founder of Hartsvale, was slain by the storm giant paramount of the one of the steadings in the south . Hartkiller's son, King Brun , would be the first to reign there. During the same time period, several other castles, for the kingdom's earls, were also being constructed.</p>
