<p>Aladiam's Imports was a shop in Tegal's Mark that sold spices and silks imported from Sembia during the mid-14 th century DR . The establishment was run by a retired Calishite adventurer named Aladiam . He was a known smuggler and fence that used his shop to look out for and recruit adventurers to move his contraband.</p>
<p>The shop was defended by some sort of invisible guardian. On one occasion it ripped through three Sembians who confronted Aladiam about some stolen goods.</p>
