<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1479 DR, Varriel discovered notes about a necromancer 's laboratory inside Undermountain . Not suited for adventure, she hired Aizel Treemaine , a female elf wizard, to explore on her behalf. However, Aizel joined the doomed Rutherford Urmbrusk 's party and disappeared. Soon after, some undead with a symbol associated with the laboratory started wandering the dungeon. So Varriel decided to hire a second adventuring party in order to uncover the matter.</p>
