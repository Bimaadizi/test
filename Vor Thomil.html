<p>Vor Thomil was a powerful fomorian kingdom within the Feywild that was connected to Oman's Isle in the Moonshae Isles during the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The kingdom was located within the wilds of the Feydark . It was a dark underground realm of filth and immorality.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Vor Thomil was ruled by the mad fomorian Queen Connomae . It endured only at her whim, and her subjects always awaited her next mad edict with trepidation.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The kingdom was protected by fomorian guards as well as beasts . Travelers near the realm were captured and forced to provide entertainment for the queen and her court, such as with poetry , song, acting, or gladiatorial combat.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Vor Thomil was the nearest fomorian realm to the eladrin city of Shinaelestra , and the two realms were thus often at war.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, the fomorians had forged an alliance with the Feywild lycanthropes of Brokenstone Vale , who likewise had a foothold in the Moonshae Isles among the Black Blood tribe on Moray . The two factions sought to work together on the Material Plane toward their respective goals.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The fomorians of Vor Thormil were said to have been those who had enslaved and mutated the firbolgs of the Moonshae Isles through forced breeding in ancient times. They arrived in the Moonshaes circa −2000 DR at the summons of Kazgoroth , and battled against the combined forces of the Earthmother's children , the Llewyrr elves , and the dwarves . Although they were defeated and driven to the fringes of the isles after only a few decades, they did not retreat back into the Feywild until the fey of Sarifal also departed circa −500 DR .</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the fomorians and cyclopes of Vor Thomil invaded Oman's Isle via a portal in the Grampalt Highlands . They subjugated the local firbolgs and toppled the human kingdom of Oman , slaughtering its villages and capturing its capital at Iron Keep before Midsummer . A number of the fomorians migrated to Oman's Isle at this time, seeking to further their queen's goals of conquest.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, excursions from Vor Thomil to Oman's Isle were quite common as Queen Connomae wanted to capture a great number of slaves to use to assault the city of Shinaelestra in the Feywild. However, although the fomorians had a stranglehold over Oman's Isle, they had been unable to successfully mount any assault over the seas to other Moonshae Isles. As of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , it was hoped that an orc shaman named Crughth could finally solve their transportation problem by corrupting the Oman Moonwell such that it could become a portal to the moonwells on the other islands.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The realm was populated by evil fomorians and their many thralls and slaves, including cyclopes, eladrin , gnomes , and fey-touched humans . The kingdom was also home to quicklings .</p>
