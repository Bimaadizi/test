<p>The Order of Saint Dionysus was a monastic order that was devoted to Ilmater and followed Saint Dionysus , the patron saint of wine and other alcoholic spirits.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Order of Saint Dionysus was formed around St. Dionysus , a saint of the god Ilmater .</p>
<p>The Order of Saint Dionysus came to prominence with Friar Dugald , a cleric of the order who adventured with Gareth Dragonsbane and his band. In their heroic adventures together, they liberated the Bloodstone Lands of Damara and Vaasa , slew Zhengyi the Witch-King, stole and destroyed the Wand of Orcus , and slew an avatar of Tiamat in the Abyss , before finally returning to Damara to rebuild in the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR . Dugald anonymously donated some of his share of the gold and gems from Tiamat's hoard to the construction of the Church of Dionysus in the city of Goliad . Though mostly an act of devotion, this also helped win over the people of Goliad and the Duchy of Brandiar , as it was as much a defensive structure as a cathedral.</p>
<p>Though still several years before completion by 1359 DR, the Church of Dionysus inspired some twenty or so clerics to join the Order of St. Dionysus, and dozens of people applied to join the church guard. Damarans of all faiths came to see the Church of Dionysus as the means and symbol of their desire to never again be tyrannized.</p>
<h2>Areas</h2>
<p>The Order was active in the Damara, thanks to the efforts of Friar Dugald. The Church of Dionysus in Goliad was a key center of its activities.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>St. Dionysus was the patron saint of alcoholic spirits and, as such, the members of the Order were often inebriated.</p>
