<p>Symbril's House was an inn in the city of Elturel in the Western Heartlands in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<p>With high quality for moderate prices, it was a cozy little place in the city's High District. It stood close to Maiden's Leap, and both overlooked and opened into the Garden.</p>
<p>As Lord Dhelt decreed that inns and taverns could not operate under the same roof, and inns could not serve drinks, Symbril's House was expressly an inn.</p>
