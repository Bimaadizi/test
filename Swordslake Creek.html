<p>A mind flayer named Alothgos in human guise briefly ruled the Swordslake Creek for around two years, before the 14 th century DR. The aberration slew Lord Tagarth Ironbrow and claimed the rulership of the town in the process.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The hamlet of Swordslake Creek was named after an ancient orcish massacre â€“ a battle between a human troupe who tried to erect a stronghold and a tribe of orcs. There were several stories in existence that described the battle, with the most popular stating that humans "slaked their swords in orc blood from sunset to sunset." Whatever was the true story behind the conflict, humans emerged victorious and successfully established a camp of Swordslake Creek. With time, the camp expanded to be a humble keep surrounded by a hamlet.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Raised Banner, 227 DR , a pillar of smoke rose out of the Mountains of the Alaoreum . The smoke was a product of a great battle between the dwarves of Ironfang Deep and a red dragon named Stormcrossing . Inhabitants of Swordslake Creek witnessed the rising smoke, the first indication that a previously unknown community of dwarves existed in the Alaoreum.</p>
<p>At some point before the 14 th century DR, a mind flayer attempted to claim the keep by slaying the town's Lord Tagarth Ironbrow. Illithid Alothgos was successful. He reigned for two seasons while wearing a magical disguise of a human ruler. The new Lord rarely left his keep and only surrounded himself with trusted bodyservants. The most attractive of which, usually women, were rarely apart from Alothgos. The would-be-lord was defeated after a short stint in a fierce spell-battle. A band of mages became infuriated by the Lord's crippling taxes designed to force the spellcasters out of Swordslake Creek, and they retaliated. However, the keep of Swordslake Creek was shattered in the process.</p>
