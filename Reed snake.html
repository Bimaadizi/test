<p>Reed snakes , also known as thin snakes , were a species of small venomous snakes .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Reed snakes were small and very thin, usually no more than 4 feet (1.2 meters) long with bodies no thicker than the stem of a small flower. Their dull green scales allowed them to blend in with grass.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>A bite from a reed snake released a deadly toxin into the bloodstream of its prey. Due to their size, they only attacked sleeping prey, including humanoids . The bite from a reed snake was usually fatal and caused great pain in the victim, beginning as a slight sting at the site of the bite and eventually radiating throughout the whole body. A neutralize poison spell neutralized the effects of the venom, and diamond cure was recommended as an antivenom.</p>
<h2>Habitat</h2>
<p>Reed snakes lived in the temperate grasslands of Pelleor's Prairie in the Backlands region of the Western Heartlands .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Reed snakes hunted during the night. They spent the daytime hours hiding and sleeping, hiding within long grasses or reeds.</p>
