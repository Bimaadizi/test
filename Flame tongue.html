<p>A flame tongue was a rare type of magical sword with a burning blade.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>After the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , these were treated as plain +1 swords . However, these swords were further enhanced against certain creatures: regenerating creatures (like trolls and lycanthropes ); avians, flammable creatures, and cold-using creatures (like ice toads , white dragons , winter wolves , and yeti ); and especially the undead .</p>
<p>After the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , these were treated as +1 flaming burst longswords . Once a day, the sword could be used to launch a ray of fire up to 30 feet (9 meters).</p>
<p>Upon utterance of its command word , a flame tongue would erupt into flames, radiating a bright light. The arcane fire would remain until commanded to stop, or unless the blade was dropped or sheathed.</p>
<p>The flames could easily burn paper , parchment , dry wood, and webs, and ignite oils.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>These blades were created with the use of the scorching ray and either the flame blade , flame strike or fireball spells .</p>
