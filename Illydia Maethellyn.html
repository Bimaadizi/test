<h2>History</h2>
<p>Illydia grew up in an elven village, with her family dedicated to the wardship of the Moontear of Sehanine Moonbow . When Illydia was around 15 years old, she had a friend called Cerric , but her parents did not approve of their friendship, as their family had a sacred duty and could not afford such dalliances. She and Cerric were eventually separated.</p>
<p>Around that same time, Illydia encountered a group of drow travelers while out playing by herself, and, to spite her parents for denying her Cerric's companionship, gave the drow directions to their village. However they turned out to be scouts for a drow raiding party, and the village was invaded and her parents and the villagers killed or captured, and the Moontear lost to the drow.</p>
<p>During her life, Illydia saw great suffering such as slavery in Menzoberranzan before she was saved by Tezzarae , a drow priestess of Eilistraee . It was said that Sehanine gave Illydia purpose. She used her bow and her divine powers to make up for past mistakes.</p>
