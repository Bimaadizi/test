<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , the first boarding arrows were created by a half-elven pirate named Darius Gulch who got frustrated with his crew getting tangled up in the rigging when boarding enemy ships. Darius used his booty to commission special enchantments weaved onto arrows to outfit his crew with. Ironically enough, Darius's buccaneers' death rate remained high as they kept on teleporting into a crowd of armed enemy sailors.</p>
<p>Boarding arrows were in common use in the late-14 th century DR . Notably, Captain Allendry of the Midnight Rose outfitted his crew and offered the bolts for sale.</p>
