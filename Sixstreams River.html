<p>Sixstreams River , also known as the arm , was a river in the Sword region of Anauroch .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This river ran west from the Desertsmouth Mountains into Tel Badir , a D'tarig village whose streets winded along it and were cascaded through by it. It was situated between two large streams and four smaller ones, which also came from the Desertsmouth Mountains. A bit west of Tel Badir, the six streams all coaleseced into one large river, hence the name Sixstreams River.</p>
<p>The Sixstreams ran out westward from Tel Badir into the desert. Within 30 miles (48,000 meters) of the village it disappeared into the sand, emptying down into the Buried Realms cavern that contained the beholder city of Ooltul . The runoff from the river formed an island of sand and a moat around it, known to the cavern's inhabitants as Zorx and Sand Lake respectively.</p>
