<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Each of these intricately cut sharp thrown disks was enhanced with a +2 enchantment that, upon striking a target, burned the target with magic fire.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The creator of Dragon's Tail shurikens remained unknown in the west as even the inscribed symbol was poorly translated by the sages and just as poorly comprehended. By the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , some of these enchanted exotic thrown weapons had reached the Sword Coast and the city of Neverwinter . In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Dragon's Tail were exported from the eastern realms and sold in Okuzo's Imports store in the Harbor Loop district of Westgate .</p>
