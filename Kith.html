<p>Kith was the youngest member of the all-female adventuring Company of the Swanmays circa 1350 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kith was blessed with the beauty of youth unspoiled by the rough adventuring life. Her lovely features often left others feeling inadequate and plain. Kith had long often plaited chestnut-colored hair.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Kith was a wizard in training tutored by Anastra Syluné Silverhand of Shadowdale during the Swanmays many stops there. Presumably, Kith continued her training with the river witch until Syluné's death.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before Swanmays' alleged disbandment circa 1350 DR , Kith, along with the rest of the Swanmays adventured around Suzail , the Dalelands , and surrounding regions. When they earned their living by guarding and guiding trader caravans through Cormanthor , they often passed through Shadow Gap and stayed in the North Gate Inn . When seasons changed, they spent their winters in Shadowdale , enjoying the warm company and strong drinks with Jhaele Silvermane at the Old Skull Inn .</p>
<p>At some point, Kith came to apprentice under the river witch of Shadowdale, Syluné, who taught the young lady to read, write, and the arcane arts. Unfortunately, Kith did not leave much of the impression with the residents of Shadowdale, Mourngrym Amcathra , the lord of Shadowdale, did not remember her name when he met Alias in 1357 DR , even though he did remember reading about her in Elminster's Tales . Jhaele Silvermane fondly remembered the young mage and her love of dancing.</p>
