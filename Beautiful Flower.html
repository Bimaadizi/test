<p>Beautiful Flower was a deepspawn that resided within the Crypt of Orbakh in the Polyandrium of Myth Drannor since the time before the Weeping War and was released into the wild in 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Beautiful Flower was a full-grown deepspawn aberration, 14 feet (4.3 meters) in diameter. It appeared to be a huge leathery sphere with many suckered tentacle-like appendages; some of the thinner appendages ended with eyeballs, and one central tentacle sprouted a maw.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Beautiful Flower was intelligent and reasonable.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>One of the most notable abilities of the deepspawn was its ability to replicate creatures it consumed, even if the flesh consumed was nothing but a small chunk of the creature.</p>
<p>Like other deepspawn, Beautiful Flower was completely immune to poisons , spells , and abilities of similar effect.</p>
<p>When forced into melee combat, Beautiful Flower made multiple attacks with its tentacle-like appendages from a distance. The creature also possessed good combat reflexes and could perform a bull rush to surprise its opponents. Beautiful Flower was capable of using its spell-like ability to cast hold to restrain its opponents, as well as physically constricting them with its appendages. If the opponent failed to escape, they would suffer crippling crushing damage. Among other spell-like abilities, Beautiful Flower was able to cast detect thought and water breathing at will, and could heal itself once a day.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Beautiful Flower shared a bizarre familiar relationship with the copies of its "father", Famras. The pair could often be found gently caressing each other.</p>
<p>Beautiful Flower was the creator of all the creatures that were not undead within the Crypt of Orbakh. It used Famras spawns to negotiate with others and control the splintered groups of creatures within the ecosystem.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before the Weeping War ( 711 – 714 DR ), one of the wizards of the Tower of Bones , Famras , was performing some perverse magical experiments that were too dark and twisted for even his fellow necromancers . His activities were discovered and, as a punishment, Famras was thrown into the crypt of the recently deceased Orbakh and sealed inside. Unknown to the wizards of the Tower of Bones, the guilty necromancer had smuggled into the crypt a baby deepspawn , and his collection of monster flesh samples.</p>
<p>Even though tomb was filled with undead guardians, Famras survived and kept his Beautiful Flower "child" alive by feeding it his own blood, monster bits from his collection, and weaker undead he'd hunted ( zombies , ghouls , and ghasts ). Even though the deepspawn could not replicate undead, it could still consume their flesh and grow big and strong.</p>
<p>Some time later, Beautiful Flower was mature enough to start spawning copies of the creatures it consumed. It started creating cows and fish (created from the bits of Famras's last meal before imprisonment), bugbears , dire apes , krenshars , and aquatic ogres . These clones treated Famras as their leader for the wizard's arcane powers and Beautiful Flower's presence. The necromancer hoped to eventually spawn enough creatures to dig a way out of the underground crypt, but he never lived long enough for that to happen. Famras was badly hurt in a fight with one of the crypt's guardian wights and succumbed to a disease. His "child" consumed the necromancer's body as an act of love for its "father".</p>
<p>Many years later, Beautiful Flower remained within the Crypt of Orbakh. In time, the crypt became a crowded and vicious mini-ecosystem of the countless cloned creatures created by Beautiful Flower. When the group of heroes that was searching for the artifact known as Orbakh's ivory scepter unsealed the ancient crypt in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Beautiful Flower avoided confrontation and offered the heroes access to the artifact in exchange for its freedom. Flower was willing to do anything to be able to leave its prison along with its "father".</p>
