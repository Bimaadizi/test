<p>Thindol was a country on the southern coast of the Chultan Peninsula .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Above ground, it was covered in long grasslands. Below ground, however, there were flooded tunnels.</p>
<p>The Hills of Sythrilia hid a network of narrow caves.</p>
<h2>People</h2>
<p>The land was inhabited by Tashalans and Chultans of the Thinguth tribe. Although human , some carried the blood of their yuan-ti conquerors. They were famed for their incredibly swift running ability. Others had exceptional endurance.</p>
<p>Gold dwarves dwelt in the hills and the mountains, while kuo-toa and yuan-ti (with a swimming snake appearance) lurked in the flooded tunnels. The latter two races were allied and at war with the dwarves.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>It was a mercantile nation defended by very capable militias and dedicated yuan-ti hunters. They fought with fine cutlasses and even blade boots and wore studded leather , while potions of blur were common.</p>
