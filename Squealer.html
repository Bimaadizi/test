<p>A squealer was a carnivorous creature with three arms that dwelled in forests and jungles.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They had piggish faces and leathery skin, covered in a fine layer of green and brown furs in a camouflage-like pattern. The adults stood 8​ to ​9 feet (2.4​ to ​2.7 meters) tall and had two arms some 4 feet (1.2 meters) long, with a third arm placed on their backs 5 feet (1.5 meters) long. All their appendages ended in dangerous claws. They got the name squealer due to a high pitched cry which they gave off. Additionally they were able to imitate various other high pitched noises such as screams of terror or the cries of a baby.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Squealers only inhabited the woodlands where the trees stood close enough together that they were able to move from one tree to another without coming down to the ground. They made their nests high in the branches of those same trees. Solitary creatures by nature, they only came together during mating season where pairs of squealers would lair together for brief periods of time. Indistinguishable from males, the females would arrive at the nest of a male, give birth to living young, then place the offspring in a pouch on the male's abdomen. Afterward she would leave, returning to her own territory. After about a year the squealer young would be driven away from the male's territory, setting out to claim their own. A squealer would mark its territory by leaving long gashes in the trees-trunk which stood at the borders of claimed land. They preferred fresh kills and would sometime bring back living prey if they had already eaten their fill. If circumstances allowed they would even feed their captives as to keep them alive until hunger made them kill and eat them.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>Squealers were able to be trained as guards if raised from infancy, they would be very loyal to their adoptive group, and could learn several commands. A live captured specimen could fetch some 3,000 gp , while a trained individual could go for as high as 10,000 gp .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Salabak created the illusion of a squealer to scare away the beggars of Memnon who were hanging around him, Vajra , and Conner .</p>
