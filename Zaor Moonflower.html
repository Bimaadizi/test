<p>Zaor Moonflower was a moon elf , the patriarch of House Moonflower , the husband of Queen Amlaruil Moonflower , and the king of Evermeet until the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Zaor had long dark-blue locks of hair reminiscent of sapphires or stormy seas and the most unusual color among the moon elves, and his eyes were blue, flecked with gold. He was exceedingly tall for an elf , standing over 6 feet (1.8 meters), with a frame as muscular as a human warrior. His height and physique were inherited by his eldest sons Zhoron and Xharlion , as well as his youngest son, Lamruil Moonflower .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Zaor Moonflower was born in Semberholme in the Year of Writhing Darkness, 572 DR , some 237 years before the birth of Amlaruil Moonflower , to his moon elf ranger father. For a time, he served in Myth Drannor as a ranger amongst the Akh'Velahrn before eventually taking on the mantle of leadership there. He was the bearer of one of the most powerful elven moonblades , known as the King's Blade .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Viper, 652 DR , Zaor Moonflower became one of the youngest officers of the Akh'Velahr in Cormanthyr .</p>
<p>In the Year of Doom, 714 DR , Zaor was one of the survivors of Myth Drannor who had sought refuge on Evermeet . In the winter of the Year of Hungry Jaws, 715 DR , he met Amlaruil in an unknown clearing for the first time. The encounter sparked Zaor to become the king of Evermeet.</p>
<p>Zaor became king of Evermeet in the Year of Twelve Teeth, 888 DR . Through political maneuvering by Montagor Amarillis , Zaor was pressured to wed Lydi'aleera Amarillis while he had already conceived Ilyrana with Amlaruil. However, upon Lydi'aleera's death many years later because of Prince Rhenalyrr , Zaor wed his true love Amlaruil. They had their youngest child Lamruil Moonflower by the Year of the Shrieker, 1272 DR .</p>
<p>Zaor was rumored to have received the Fountain of Stars as a gift by Sehanine Moonbow .</p>
<p>King Zaor was murdered at the end of his 432 nd year of reign on Ches 2 , the Year of Chains, 1321 DR , in the gardens of the Moonstone Palace by Fenian Ni'Tessine , an assassin sent by Kymil Nimesin . Fenian was originally seeking Princess Amnestria , so he considered the assassination of Zaor a fortunate accident. After the Zaor's death, Queen Amlaruil became sole ruler of Evermeet. Amlaruil was able to visit Arvandor briefly to speak with Zaor, but then she had to return to Evermeet, as she was still among the living.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Zaor and Amlaruil were the parents of their oldest daughter Princess Ilyrana , twins Prince Zhoron and Prince Xharlion (born while they were unwed). Next came Prince Chozzaster , Princess Shandalar , and two more sets of twin girls, Princess Tira'allara and Hhora and then Princesses Lazziar and Gemstarzah . Many years later, they had four more children, first Amnestria , then Prince Zandro , Prince Finufaranell , and lastly Prince Lamruil . Via Princess Amnestria , they were the grandparents of the half-elf Arilyn Moonblade (wife of Danilo Thann ) and her secret elder half-brother Elaith Craulnober .</p>
<p>Adamar Alenauth was his look-alike, but lesser in stature, who unknowingly had a son named Rhenalyrr borne by Lydi'aleera. Prince Rhenalyrr was raised by Zaor until his death at the King's Blade bonding .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Zaor was the bearer of one of the most powerful elven moonblades , the King's Blade .</p>
<p>He possessed a pendant later worn by his youngest son Lamruil , the next King's Blade bearer, around his neck.</p>
