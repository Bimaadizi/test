<p>Starmara Dagohnlar was a wealthy merchant's wife in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Starmara was no longer attracted to her husband, the merchant Durexter Dagohnlar , and at times considered his death. She had a broad network of contacts, good enough that she already knew on sight that Malakar Surth and Aumun Tholant Bezrar, two importers and underworld figures, were working with Harnrim Starangh . She didn't trust her servants one bit.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Starmara took Westgate as a place of safety, and had visited it at least once, a house-of-baths being familiar to her.</p>
<p>One night in the early spring of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Starmara and her husband were taken captive by Malakar Surth and Aumun Tholant Bezrar . She was bound up, and fainted during one of their threats; later, she screamed, conscious again, as her captors were interrupted by Narnra Shalace , a thief from Waterdeep , breaking through the window of the bedroom where all four were present during her escape from Glarasteer Rhauligan , who was in hot pursuit. Her captors attacked the latter, suspecting both crashers of being hired killers; Rhauligan ultimately defeated them both.</p>
<p>Despite Starmara's pleadings, however, they were not rescued, and finally resorted to gnawing away at their bindings. Bezrar escaped shortly after; by dawn, the two Dagohnlars were still cowering, almost certainly still bound, but Malakar also chose to flee rather than slay them.</p>
<p>They were later found by the Guard; while giving a statement, she was rather displeased with her husband's caginess.</p>
