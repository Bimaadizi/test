<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR , Immult, at the time the oldest tax collector in Cormyr, tried to collect back taxes on Sabrast Windriver . Ultimately, he took him away for forced labor as punishment for his tax evasion and brought Vangerdahast and four Purple Dragons for that purpose. However, Elminster appeared and brought money enough to cover Sabrast's debts. He was almost rebuffed until he warned them that failing to accept his payment would release four small dragons into the treasury of the Palace.</p>
