<p>Mjenir Tormhaalt ( pronounced : / m ɛ ˈ j ɛ n ɪər / meh-YEN-eer ) was a Reghedmen human shaman from the Tribe of the Elk on the Reghed Glacier in Icewind Dale in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He relished the authority he had earned through his ostensible revelations from the spirits, but most of the time, his counsel simply derived from his deep knowledge of nature. He waged a constant struggle to protect his position from upheaval.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Even though Mjenir's age was close to that of King Jarund , Mjenir looked a decade younger because he had neither borne the weight of the tribe's leadership nor faced the rigors of warfare.</p>
<p>Mjenir had icy blue eyes and long braided platinum-blond hair.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Mjenir had a profound understanding of the natural world and it alone made him an invaluable member of the tribe. Mjenir was known for his ability to speak with animals . However, he had nearly no control over the spirits of nature and could perform only the simplest divinations .</p>
<p>The shaman was able to cast the produce flame cantrip.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Mjenir had a short marriage with a woman who passed away when their only son, Olaf Tormhaalt , was still a child.</p>
<p>Mjenir's relationship with Olaf remained distant, primarily because the shaman's main priority was safeguarding his standing within the clan.</p>
<p>He was suspicious about Hedrun 's emerging powers exceeding his own, which could result in him losing his position in the tribe. Mjenir encouraged the tribe to treat the girl as a threat.</p>
<p>One of the tribe's older warriors, Soren Arnsfirth , Hedrun's father, sought advice and help for his daughter from Mjenir, but the shaman wasn't interested in it and insisted on ostracizing the girl.</p>
<p>All members of the Tribe of the Elk sought his guidance. King Jarund constantly consulted with Mjenir, especially when Auril inflicted severe winters on the surrounding lands. As both of their sons passed away, the king's bond with his shaman deepened.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During his early years, Mjenir commenced his apprenticeship with the tribe's former shaman. Later he became the shaman of the Tribe of the Elk and wielded the most authority among the tribe's members, second only to the king.</p>
<p>The shaman also forbade his son Olaf to see Hedrun when he realized that the boy had fallen in love with her. But the two continued to meet and it ended with Olaf's death as a result of Hedrun's uncontrollable gifts. Later Mjenir brought Olaf's dead body before King Jarund to ensure Hedrun was banished from the tribe. The shaman didn't demand her death as he was afraid of the possible power of the girl's vengeful spirit and hoped Hedrun would meet her end facing the dangers of the Reghed Glacier's wildlife.</p>
<p>With the unexpected early arrival of winter storms in the Year of the Iron Dwarf's Vengeance, 1485 DR , and rumors of an Ice Witch sweeping through the area, he began to question to himself whether banishing Hedrun had been a misstep. He assumed her to be the reason for the calamity. Worried that he or his tribe could be blamed for provoking the witch's fury, he resisted Hengar Aesnvaard 's proposal to seek assistance from Ten-Towns . He pushed for the tribe to keep moving, yet he harbored the knowledge that he couldn't escape the unforgiving grip of winter's wrath. He sought a means to confront the witch's threat without confessing his role to the rest of the tribe.</p>
<p>Circa the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , Mjenir had a vision where he saw a group of adventurers traveling to the Reghed Glacier. He and several other members of the tribe, among whom was Hengar, departed from the tribe's camp to offer their assistance. On their way to the glacier, they fought the Frostmaiden's followers among the Tribe of the Tiger . According to various sources, the adventurers and Mjenir's and Hengar's warriors were ambushed by a Tiger Tribe squad led by Bjornhild Solvigsdottir or frost druid Ajka . It's unknown if Mjenir survived the battle.</p>
