<p>Rhaneld was a poor child who inhabited the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Rhaneld was a human boy with a light sun-kissed skin tone, green eyes, and light brown hair.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the city of Baldur's Gate was suffering from the encroaching war with the Cult of the Absolute , an influx of refugees, scarcity of resources, and an increase in crime. Bastian d'Zinn , a wealthy enough individual, was hit in the head with a pebble by a child playing on a road in the Lower City . The kid, Rhaneld, ended up being yelled at by Bastian, and the curfuffle attracted a small crowd of Baldurians with varied opinions on the child, including Tylman Sands , who was one of such opinionated gawkers who believed that Rhaneld would end up growing up a criminal. Bastian himself, though, considered the child to be a piece of human garbage and nothing more.</p>
