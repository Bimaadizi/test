<p>A kamadan ( pronounced : /ˈ k æ m ɑː d ɑː n / KÆM-a-dan ) was a leopard -like creature from the jungles of Chult .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kamadans were otherwise identical to leopards, except for the additional six snake bodies protruding from their shoulders.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>The typical strategy of a hunting kamadan was to use its sleeping gas breath weapon to knock its prey unconscious before moving for the kill. The snakes also possessed a powerful poison with their bites.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Kamadans hunted either alone or in mated pairs.</p>
<p>Some sages claimed that kamadans were related to displacer beasts , although most recognized that the similarities between them were coincidental and the creatures were unrelated. Kamadans were also known to despise displacer beasts and to attack them on sight.</p>
<p>A close relative of the kamadan was the kamatlan , a similar creature that was native to Maztica .</p>
<h2>Notable kamadans</h2>
<p>Shagambi , one of the Nine Trickster Gods of Chult , was a wise and virtuous kamadan.</p>
