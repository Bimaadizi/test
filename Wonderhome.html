<p>Wonderhome was the divine realm of Gond , the Faerûnian god of craftsmen.</p>
<h2>Cosmography</h2>
<p>In the Great Wheel cosmology , Wonderhome was located in the Outlands , though its exact placement within that plane was uncertain. In the World Tree cosmology , it was located in the celestial plane known as the House of Knowledge , a plane that Gond shared with the Faerûnian deity of invention Oghma . And in the World Axis cosmology , Wonderhome was also located within the House of Knowledge, but there the latter was considered to be an astral dominion belonging to Oghma.</p>
<p>A portal between this realm and the Mithral Forge , divine realm of the gnomish craftsmen deity Flandal Steelskin , was maintained by Gond.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Wonderhome was said to be a great workshop full of all manner of inventions. Some were recognizable to Faerûnians , though many more were not as they had yet to be discovered.</p>
