<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Michell Academy existed near the town of Berdusk many years before the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR . Its fall followed an hour-long battle against a nearby temple to Loviatar with whom the Academy had an antagonizing relationship. The temple's mistresses ensured the academics' torture would last for days, if historians were to be believed. Jamal Briars's torture was made ironic. The Loviatans's elementals dragged him across thorned briars until Jamal bled to death.</p>
