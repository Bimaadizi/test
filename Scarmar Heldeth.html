<p>Scarmar Heldeth was a mage from Athkatla , working as a wizard-for-hire in Cormyr in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was extremely cautious, and got very skittish when things weren't perfect.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He had at least one blasting spell, and one defensive spell that created a cloud of glowing dust around him.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He carried a paralyzing wand, almost certainly a Wand of paralyzation .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He was a wizard for hire.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>During the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , he was hired by Traevyn Illance , but only for one evening.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Traevyn Illance hired him for an evening after the disaster in the Council of the Dragon of 1479 DR, to capture Rauligus Helderstone . Scarmar Heldeth, together with Morligul Downdagger , assaulted the home where the man was staying, and took him captive; along the way, they also captured Storm Silverhand and slew everyone there, save for the War Wizard Reldyk Applecrown , whose comatose body was actually harboring the mind of Elminster Aumar .</p>
<p>However, knowing they had failed to capture or slay one of the people there, Scarmar Heldeth decided to flee the city, fearful of what the loose end may bring; he had already been paid, and was less trusting of Traevyn Illance's loyalty than his companion Downdagger was. He even cast a protective spell before leaving, not trusting Downdagger.</p>
