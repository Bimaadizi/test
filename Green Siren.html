<p>The Green Siren was a privateer ship that belonged to Captain Thoster in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The pirate ship was named after its elaborate figurehead. It was a painted and sculpted form of a woman, a siren with shimmering green scales on her body replacing clothes. The siren's eyes sparkled in the sun with emerald green.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1395 DR , Captain Thoster claimed the Siren had had a run-in with a ghost ship .</p>
<p>Circa 1396 DR , the Green Siren did not fly its privateer pirate colors; it proudly displayed the Marhana Shipping trading company's flag. Thoster and his crew were tasked by Behroun Marhana with securing a seafaring alliance with kuo-toas of the Sea of Fallen Stars. That mission took the Siren to Hegruth , a newly surfaced island where the ship was besieged by aberrant kuo-toas, scrags , and sea hags , losing a few sailors and, namely Roger in the battle. The journey took the crew to Taunissik kuo-toa colony next where Dorian Nyrotha fell to the forces of kraken Gethshemeth .</p>
