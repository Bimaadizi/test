<p>The Way of Mercy was a monastic tradition that emphasized the monk powers of life-force manipulation in order to help and heal others.</p>
<h2>Activities/Culture</h2>
<p>Monks of the Way of Mercy might act as wandering physicians to the poor and hurt, administer to the needy as members of a religious order, or be the beloved, gentle-voiced healers of their local communities. However, not all mercies were pleasant, and some such monks were responsible for making grim choices rooted in reality rather than idealism. Some walkers of this way focused on the macabre aspect of their work, but any would bring a swift end to those beyond help as a final act of mercy.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Monks of the Way of Mercy carried with them certain implements of mercy, such as herbalistic supplies , and usually donned robes with deep cowls, often concealing their faces with special "Merciful Masks". Such masks might resemble a skull or raven , a butterfly , a crying or laughing visage, or simply be blank and white. While not necessary, they often wore the masks while using their characteristic abilities, presenting themselves as faceless bringers of mercy through life and death alike.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Monks of the Way of Mercy were skilled in matters of medicine and reading others. The hands of a monk of the Way of Mercy were hands of both healing and harm. With their mystical touch they could mend or inflict wounds, meting out comfort and hurt even in the midst of unleashing a flurry of blows. As they progressed in their teachings, they would learn to administer even greater cures and ailments as they saw fit, sometimes even with the same touch. It was within their power to bring an end to sickness, poisoning, sensory failure, and paralyzation, or to temporarily leave their subjects physically sickened.</p>
<p>Eventually a monk of the Way of Mercy would so thoroughly master life energy that they would gain the power to bestow the ultimate mercy. With a touch they could restore to life any who had died less than a day ago, reviving them free of any lesser ailments.</p>
