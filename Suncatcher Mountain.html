<p>Suncatcher Mountain was a tall peak in the Galena Mountains .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The peak was located in the southern reaches of the Galenas near where they met the Earthspur Mountains . It was visible to many in Damara .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , a strange cloud appeared above Suncatcher Mountain and remained there, not budging even when it was windy. Some in Damara and Vaasa claimed that when the sun was low, they could see a castle atop the cloud. The appearance of the strange cloud prompted Gareth Dragonsbane , then the Baron of Bloodstone , to ask his Spysong organization to gather news about this bizarre occurrence. Riordan Parnell , the leader of Spysong, sent his cousin, Celedon Kierney , to investigate. Celedon was an experienced scout and explorer of the Galenas, but was also somewhat irresponsible. After setting up camp on Suncatcher Mountain, he soon determined that the cloud was home to a kingdom of cloud giants , but rather than report back on his findings, he stayed to explore and perhaps steal some treasure. This prompted Riordan, along with the rest of Spysong, to worry for his safety.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , Suncatcher Mountain hosted a cloud-top kingdom of cloud giants who kept cloud dragons as pets.</p>
