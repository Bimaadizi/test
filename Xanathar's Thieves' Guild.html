<p>Xanathar's Thieves' Guild , or simply Xanathar Guild , was a criminal and slaving organization in Waterdeep and Skullport run by a paranoid elder beholder .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This criminal and slaver network was one of the most powerful on the Sword Coast, but often unintentionally acted as a buffer against other evil organizations. They operated out of Skullport , but were otherwise largely active in Waterdeep.</p>
<h2>Membership</h2>
<p>Members of the guild were trained in stealth, discretion, and tactics with fighters , rogues , sorcerers , wizards , and experts , which comprised most of its numbers. An ever-growing organization, it utilized multiple mouthpieces to protect and conceal the identity of the Xanathar . To join, a member had to prove their ruthlessness, obedience, and loyalty by committing a serious crime—killing or selling a friend or family member into slavery—as well as paying 300 gp . The typical agent earned dues of 60 gp a month.</p>
<p>Support generally came in these ways:</p>
<p>Among the low-ranking guild members, no-one really knew who Xanathar was. Few had an inkling he was a beholder, and fewer still had spoken to him.</p>
<p>Given that the faction was evil at the core, advancement through assassination was a popular "shortcut".</p>
<p>Some of the more unusual members of the guild in the late 1400s DR were a group of five dwarves that had been modified by the mind flayer Nihiloor to operate and serve as a surveillance system for the Xanathar .</p>
<p>The Xanathar Guild was also known to employ a number of goblins and bugbears , some of whom were infected with intellect devourers , presumably by Nihiloor.</p>
