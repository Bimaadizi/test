<p>Lassalar Ormitar was a male human fighter in the city of Tantras in the Vast around 1358 DR .</p>
<p>In 1358 DR , shortly after the Time of Troubles , he was head of the Ormitar noble house, a member of the High Council that governed Tantras, and commanded the Guard , the military force that defended and policed the city. Although the Guard was directly responsible to the Council, its loyalties lay with Lassalar, who was more serious about restricting merchant freedoms in favour of law and order.</p>
