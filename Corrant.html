<p>Corrant was the Eleventh City of the Sword of ancient Jhaamdath , located in the region of central Faerûn later known as the Vilhon Reach .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The city of Corrant was approximately one kilometer across in its prime. It was a seemingly random collection of grand buildings. It retained its urban design as a ruin, albeit overgrown and swallowed by a marsh. At its center stood a great ruined temple to Auppenser , the only part of the ruins visible, still sticking up above ground as of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . The temple also functioned as a lounge or club as the inhabitants of Jhaamdath considered worship to be a "hobby diversion." The temple's worship was not done through grand religious rites but rather through private meditations. Topiary-filled gardens were common in Corrant during the days of antiquity.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Corrant was established in the −4470 DR as part of Jhaamdath, making it the Eleventh City of the Sword.</p>
<p>As of the late 14 th century DR, several psionic items were appearing across the Dragon Reach — Nimblesteps . These short swords were said to have been recovered from the sunken ruins of Corrant.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The center of Corrant's ruins, a temple accessible from above ground, was the habitat of a large naga community.</p>
