<p>High Lama Or-Ghash Gol was a lama dwelling in the Chigidi Mountains on the Plain of Horses . Highly revered, Gol was considered to be the greatest high lama to have ever lived in the area.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) , Gol was interred near Mount Or-Ghash . As a memorial to the high lama, one hundred caskets were placed along the pass to the mountain, approximately 100 yards (91 meters) apart. Only one casket held Gol's remains, but which it was was a secret known only to the high lamas dwelling on Mount Or-Ghash. The mountain was visited often by lamas and pilgrims . It was expected that pilgrims make an offering such as a scarf on top of every casket. Strangely, each spring, the high lamas placed a new set of clothes in the true casket of Or-Ghash Gol, and each autumn they took them out again, finding them used, dirtied, and torn.</p>
