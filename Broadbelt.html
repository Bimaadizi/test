<p>The broadbelt or broad belt was a kind of clothing accessory that overlapped with belts and girdles in a way that combined utility with fashion.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Broadbelts were large and heavy belts worn about the waist, and covered much of the midsection thanks to the inherent broadness. A solid broadbelt was leather with metal reinforcement, and hooks, studs, spikes, and holes that added protection and attachment points for other accessories, tools, and weapons. More decorative belts functioned as jewelry first and could be decorated with precious metals like silver , gold , and platinum .</p>
<p>When combined with an armored loin guard and bustier , the full outfit functioned as a skin-baring and highly ornamental piece of armor that provided at least a little protection, as worn by the adventurer Kendra .</p>
<p>When sufficiently tightened, the belt compressed the innards and functioned as a lifting belt, protecting the wearer from injury while lifting great weights.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue offered an ornamented broadbelt for 6 gp , dyed black or brown. The belt was sourced from Boom's Garden and was able to be combined with their loin guard and bustier, and had a twistable buckle that tightened the belt.</p>
