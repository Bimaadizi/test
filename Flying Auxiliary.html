<p>The Flying Auxiliary was a squadron of 20 horse -archers of High Dale , each with a pegasus mount, who defended the dale in coordination with its local militia and hired mercenary company. They were differentiated from the Pegasus Archery Company , ironically enough, by the fact the mercenaries were only mounted upon horses .</p>
<h2>Formation</h2>
<p>This military unit was assembled by the High Constable of High Dale, Irreph Mulmar in the late 1360's DR . In their inaugural iteration, they were commanded by a young paladin named Sothinar .</p>
