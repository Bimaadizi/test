<p>Hatchrin Alet'taz was the disgraced consort of Erelal Freth inside Undermountain in the early 1490s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hatchrin became the consort of Erelal Freth and fathered her unborn eleventh child around the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . However just after those events, Erelal accused Hatchrin of plotting to poison the unborn child after childbirth (in truth, this was a false accusation planted by Drivvin Freth ) and ordered him to be imprisoned and tortured. However, Hatchrin still wanted to regain Erelal's trust. He was tortured together with the Auvryndar spy Varrn Telenna .</p>
