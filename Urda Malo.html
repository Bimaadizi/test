<p>Urda Malo was an orphan from Riatavin in Amn . Eventually, she settled in Eveningstar and opened her famous bakery. When she reached her frail twilight years, Urda hired a small army of local women to be her live-in assistants. When Urda became senile, the women completely took over the bakery but continued to care for the old woman until her death of winterchill fever . These assistants continued operating Eveningstar Bakery, and as of the late-15 th century DR, their children continued Urda Malo's legacy of making superb bread.</p>
