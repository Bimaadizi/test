<p>Jhalanrojir ( pronounced : / dʒ oʊ l ɑː n ˈ r oʊ dʒ ɛ r / jol-ann-ROJ-er ), also called the Pirateshield , was a magical shield from Turmish and found on the Sea of Fallen Stars . Its name is Turmic for "mark of the rogue" and it was once carried by the legendary pirate Immurk the Invincible .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The shield was fashioned from the shell of a blackback turtle that had apparently naturally formed the image of a skull and crossed bones on it.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Jhalanrojir reputedly enabled its bearer to breathe in water, invoke fear in one's foes, and swim as swiftly as a sea turtle. This was mostly true—while it was a +3 shield that granted the power of water breathing for an hour each day, it actually allowed the wielder to transform into a blackback sea turtle with the shield on its back whilst immersed in saltwater.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Although the provenance of the Pirateshield was understandably patchy, its name strongly suggested an origin in Turmish. According to one legend, the shell was taken from the very turtle that had inspired Immurk the Invincible to become a pirate, called the Great Pirate Turtle , and made into a shield on his instructions. However, scholars had their doubts, as Jhalanrojir was first recorded somewhat earlier, in the 1160s DR if not before.</p>
<p>Certainly, the Great Pirate was well known to have used Jhalanrojir through much of his career, until at least the Year of the Tomb, 1182 DR , when documents in Lyrabar , Impiltur , recorded Immurk owning it when he and exiled Crown Prince Talryn established the settlement on Dragonisle .</p>
<p>Jhalanrojir resurfaced in the Year of the Sarune, 1206 DR , in the possession of another feared pirate by the name of Black Anzil . Three more pirates would wield the Pirateshield , but it was lost for good long before Black Aznil died in the Year of the Swimming Cats, 1218 DR .</p>
<p>Unknown to all, by the late 14 th century DR, Jhalanrojir lay within a shipwreck situated approximately 60 miles (97 kilometers) north-northwest of Alaghôn , the capital of Turmish. It was 100 feet (30 meters) below sea level and buried beneath 3 feet (0.91 meters) of silt. The site was indicated by the few exposed ribs of the wreck's hull, which were encrusted with claw coral .</p>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>Although unconfirmed, many believed the Pirateshield inspired the traditional flag of piracy, both the black-and-white skull and crossbones symbol and its name, the Jolly Roger, which was thought to be a corruption of Jhalanrojir .</p>
