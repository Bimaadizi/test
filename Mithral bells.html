<p>Mithral bells were a type of enchanted bracelet.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These bracelets consisted of a small mithral chain of eleven mithral bells.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Each of the elven bells that adorned these bracelets could be thrown as a grenade weapon, detonating with a sound burst effect. The bell would explode after 40 feet (12 meters) if it did not strike something first.</p>
<p>Additionally, while being worn the wearer would find greater success at attempted artistic performances, provided at least three bells remained on the mithral chain.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Mithral bells could only be crafted by bards .</p>
