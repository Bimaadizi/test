<p>Cassius was a dire wolf that resided in the Astral Plane and was summoned by a unique figurine of wondrous power carved in a likeness of a wolf .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Cassius was bound to a figurine of wondrous power that had the wolf's name inscribed on its side. In order to summon Cassius, the owner of its figurine needed to rub the magic item. This could be one once per day.</p>
<p>Most of Cassius's history remained a mystery. One of the wolf's companion was a druid from Cormanthor , Branon Oakheart . The duo was attacked a group of fiends and Cassius lured the creatures away from Branon, allowing him to escape. Cassius's figurine of wondrous power was lost in the process, hidden under a patch of soil in the city of Elventree of the Moonsea region. The figurine was still there, concealed by dirt, as of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR .</p>
