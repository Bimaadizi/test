<p>The Demiplane of Nightmares was a horrific demiplane inhabited by creatures that looked like monsters out of nightmares.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Demiplane of Nightmares was a strange place of strange angles and stranger geometry that seemed unsettling, even repulsive, to people from the Material plane.</p>
<p>The Demiplane of Nightmares was variously described to be either an independent demiplane in the Ethereal plane , or a demiplane located coterminously with both the Region of Dreams and the Ethereal Plane. Either way, the boundary between the Demiplane and the Far Realm was extremely thin and the taint of the latter constantly seeped into the Demiplane, corrupting it.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Creatures known to inhabit the Demiplane of Nightmares included neh-thalggu , diaboli , feyrs , nagpas , and maelephants . Of these, only the diaboli were actually native to the demiplane. The diaboli occupied the same niche on the Demiplane of Nightmares that humans did on the Material Plane. Malferas were a native predator of the demiplane.</p>
<p>The creatures that lived in the Demiplane of Nightmares were horrific beings to the eyes of most people. It was said that they saw creatures from the Material plane in much the same way, and certainly the diaboli instinctively feared humans and other humanoids.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In −681 DR , Netherese arcanists emigrated to the Demiplane of Nightmares, where the energies infusing the plane twisted their descendants until they evolved into the Night Parade .</p>
<p>Around and prior to the year 1359 DR , members of the Night Parade opened portals back to the Realms, where they began infiltrating cities such as Calimport .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Some claimed that the dark powers must have pulled part of the Demiplane of Nightmare into the Demiplane of Dread to create an even more terrifying expanse in that place.</p>
