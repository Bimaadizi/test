<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He spent much of his time reciting poetry and verses detailing his agnostic beliefs and general lack of faith for the Enlightened gods , an act for which he would probably be executed as a heretic if even taken before a qadi . However, Judarin seemed doomed, or blessed, to forever remain surrounded by obscurity.</p>
