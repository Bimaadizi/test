<p>Roline "the Hand" Tark was a caravan guard from the city of Daggerford who made a fortune selling lizardfolk teeth to collectors, sometime before 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Roline wielded her enchanted mace against the lizardfolk, who often attacked merchant caravans of Daggerford. The weapon was crafted specifically to battle against the increased threat of the scaled humanoids of the Lizard Marsh . With time, Roline "the Hand" Tark started collecting teeth from the lizardfolk she defeated while protecting her employers' caravans. Later in life, she made a significant fortune selling the teeth to collectors. The name of the mace—the Teeth Taker —was given to the weapon by the very lizardfolk it was used against. It was a gesture of respect of the magic mace and of Roline Tark.</p>
