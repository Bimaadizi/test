<p>Everbright was a quality that could be applied to metal armor or weapons. The technique was invented or discovered by the dwarves and other races tried to duplicate its effect. The sun elves of Evermeet actually improved on the method, adding a blinding-flash ability to an everbright -treated weapon. Everbright items were incredibly shiny and incorruptibleâ€”immune to rust and corrosion. For an elvish-made blade, the wielder could cause it to flash an extremely bright light twice a day, possibly dazzling those nearby for a few seconds.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>To craft an everbright weapon using the elvish technique, one had to have the spells blindness or deafness and searing light available. To make a shiny piece of armor only required a sufficiently advanced magical armorsmith.</p>
<p>Once a weapon was enhanced with everbright , its magics could be destroyed via forgefire, earthfire (lava) or dragonfire. This enchantment also made the weapons and armor safe from rust monsters .</p>
