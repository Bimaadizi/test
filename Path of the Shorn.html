<p>The Path of the Shorn was a religious belief system practiced by a cult, who called themselves the Shorn , in the ruined city of Moradask on the Sea of Salt in the Haunted Lands of interior Zakhara in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Path of the Shorn was first realized by a mystic named Sa'ib al-Banu while adventuring in the jungles of the Cities of the Ancients . Sa'ib had a vision where the Gods of the Pantheon led him to believe that all of the hair on his body was excrement keeping him from attaining a higher spiritual state. From that day forward Sa'ib begun practicing the "Path of the Shorn" by ritualistically shaving all of the hair from his body with a razor. Years later, Sa'ib and the Shorn, settled in the ruins of Moradask where they discovered Ishistu , a living idol whom they worshiped as a rat god by covering his altar with their shorn hair.</p>
