<p>Magemasks were leather halfmasks with crystal lenses fitted within the eye openings.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Anyone wearing a magemask viewed their surroundings as if under the active effects of a detect magic spell, allowing them to easily spot magic items, hidden runes, and other wizardly writings.</p>
<p>Additionally, the wearer also enjoyed infravision and read magic abilities, though those unskilled in the magical arts would only be able to discern the general nature of the magic.</p>
<p>A magemask could not be worn with any other mask or spectacle.</p>
