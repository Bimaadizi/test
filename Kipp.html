<p>Kipp was a boy in the village of West Harbor in the Mere of Dead Men on the Sword Coast North in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kipp implied his father was a Shadow Thief from somewhere in the south (probably Amn ). Kipp's parents attempted to make their home in the swamp, but they were killed by lizardfolk . After this, Kipp went to live with Lannons , but he disliked all the rules, so he ran away.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He tried to survive by his wits, stealing whatever food and supplies he needed. He was known to sometimes steal things and throw acorns at militiamen on drill ( Bevil Starling in particular).</p>
<p>He apparently owned two pet frogs ; among his many thefts were a set of basilisk eyelashes for them, which he "acquired" from Tarmas 's workshop. (It is unknown why the frogs needed eyelashes.)</p>
