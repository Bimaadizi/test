<p>Proud Keth was a fierce and deadly warrior whose life ended in battle many years before the late 13 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Proud Keth was remembered as the first owner of a unique enchanted Myrkulyte belt – the Belt of Bones . He wore the belt into countless battles in which Keth was a force of nature, killing anything and anyone who stood in his way. In rare moments when Proud Keth surrounded, he tapped into the belt's magic, surrounding himself with a circle of bones that rent and shredded the enemies around. Keth was killed in a battle in which his enemies used the warrior's strategy against him. They used polearms and spears to end Proud Keth from a safe distance. After the warrior's death, he was interred wearing the Belt of Bones , but his grave was soon desecrated and looted, the belt – stolen.</p>
