<p>Koreeis was a powerful lamia noble sorcerer who led their proud clan of lamias in the desert of Anauroch during the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>One day, Koreeis and their lamias overstepped their bounds and wandered into the territory of the Bedine tribe led by the Sheik Jolarr . As they retreated from the desert raiders, the group of magical beasts found themselves in the ruins of the Netherese demesne of Hlaungadath , a site of evil repute. Trapped between the ruins to the north and the Bedine to the south, Koreeis and their clan were forced to head north, where the leader discovered a shimmering, iridescent portal within the ancient temple of Mystryl .</p>
<p>Since this discovery, Koreeis began focusing his clan's raids in the hopes of recovering a spellbook , or abducting a wizard , that could shed more light upon the magical portcullis .</p>
