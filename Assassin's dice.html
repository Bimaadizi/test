<p>Assassin's dice was a set of two enchanted mythic dice , used as a unique sort of ranged weapon by assassins of the Underdark .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Assassin's dice were carved out of a green substance with a skull carving on one of their sides. The dice radiated a green magical glow.</p>

The dice thrown determined the target's fate upon collision: dramatically reduced ability to land a successful attack, reduced chance of landing powerful lucky blows, crippled ability to avoid attacks, and removed ability to deflect blows.</p>
<p>The dice's powers were boosted if used as a set that included the assassin's choker and assassin's belt , boosting the assassin's chances of landing lucky deadly strikes and their chances of avoiding incoming attacks.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
