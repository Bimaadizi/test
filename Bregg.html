<p>Bregg , who was nicknamed the Strong , was a renowned Rashemaar berserker who rebelled against the wychlaran .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Cowled Defender, 189 DR , Bregg was passed over by the wychlaran to be named the next Iron Lord of Rashemen when the previous Iron Lord died. In his fury, Bregg, and those berserkers loyal to him, slew dozens of hathrans within the first few hours of his rebellion. Bregg and his followers continued to fight until the Year of Coiling Smoke, 194 DR , when he was killed. As a result of this rebellion, the wychlaran began wearing masks to hide their identities from the public as a safety measure.</p>
