<p>Loren was a rogue adventurer and part of Athan 's band that was sent to Myth Drannor by Elminster Aumar in 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the pool of radiance reawakened under Phlan in 1369 DR, Elminster was able to pinpoint its corrupting influence emanating from the ruins of Myth Drannor. Not losing any precious time, Elminster gathered an adventuring party, led by Athan, and armed them with the Gauntlets of Moander . The band spent some time within the ruins, investigating the mysterious magic that spawned the accursed pool , only to be ambushed by the forces of the Cult of the Dragon . Led by Pelendralaar , the cultists slaughtered most of the expedition.</p>
<p>Loren died as his life and energy were magically drained away, as later deduced by Ghleanna Stormlake who inspected the body. Loren's death, however, was not completely in vain. He kept a well-detailed diary with important clues about the goings-on in the ruins. The diary was recovered from his corpse by Kestrel , one of the adventurers who followed in Athan's footsteps. Another piece of legacy was his magical dagger of returning that was picked up by Kestrel. Subsequently, during a fray, she discovered Loren's dagger to be magical and named it Loren's Blade .</p>
