<p>Kuhl was a man from Vaasa that accompanied Vala Thorsdotter and other their countrymen on a journey to the west in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The burly Vaasan had a notably crooked nose.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Kuhl was prone to unwelcome leering, at least towards the elven women he encountered in Evereska .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Like his fellow Vaasans, Kuhl was the proud wielder of a darksword , a magical blade imbued with shadow magic power that only he or a member of his family could wield. Each Vaasan's sword had a unique characteristic to it, and Kuhl's blade would turn pale each night unless he doused it in mead .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was very protective of Vala, the leader of the Vaasan expedition.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kuhl and his fellow Vaasans ventured to the Greycloak Hills in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , to fulfill Bodvar 's oath to Melegaunt Tanthul . After traveling to Evereska and remaining in the elven city for a time, the group came to serve as protectors for the archmage Khelben Arunsun .</p>
<p>When the malevolent phaerimm besieged Evereska, Kuhl and the other Vaasans joined the call of battle. They fought valiantly during the Battle of Vine Vale , and Kuhl was among the few to not suffer any debilitating injuries. He was the victim of mental sabotage however, when the enemies of the Army of the North corrupted the minds of those in the war camp, turning warriors against their fellows.</p>
