<p>Twilight Hall was a temple dedicated to Cyric located in the city of Zhentil Keep during the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple was located in south Zhentil Keep in the eastern section of the Foreign Quarter .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Twilight Hall was a short structure made from black granite . The front double doors were made from copper and Cyric's holy symbol adorned them.</p>
<p>Tombs filled with notable worshipers of Cyric, including Lord Chess after a special arrangement was made with Khelben Arunsun in Waterdeep , could be found in the subterranean section beneath the temple.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The entire temple was warded with protection from magic and protection from good spells . Arcane magic and magic items of any kind would not function within Twilight Hall, though divine magic worked normally. This reflected Cyric's utter hatred of Mystra .</p>

<p>Religious services were held twice daily an hour before dawn and an hour after sunset. A special service was held once per week at midnight, and extremely special events were held during solar eclipses.</p>
