<p>Stone Bridge was a bridge located along the River Dessarin , connecting Red Larch and the Long Road via the Stone Trail to Beliard on Jundar's Pass , and the High Forest .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The bridge, which was also a temple to Moradin , was a single arch, 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) in length and 400 feet (120 meters) in height, made of granite , roughly six paces wide, with no railings or barriers. It was originally built to connect the two halves of the realm of Besilmer , and was wide enough to cope with the broadest flow of the river in times of flooding.</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , it was a site of pilgrimage for dwarves of certain moral outlook .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Stone Bridge was originally constructed to link the ancient Halls of the Hunting Axe to another long-lost dwarfhold.</p>
<p>The bridge was the site of a fight between Torhild Flametongue , founder of the dwarven realm of Besilmer , and a hill giant , resulting in Torhild's death.</p>
<p>During the final days of the Ironstar clan of dwarves, their king, Daurvos Frostbeard , was cut down on the bridge by orcs while the clan was attempting to flee south. While mortally wounded, he cried to Moradin for aid and died. Moradin's avatar, a 20‑foot-high (6.1‑meter) armored dwarf, appeared on the bridge, rallying the fleeing dwarves and leading them to victory over the orcs.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Legends claimed that the avatar of Moradin fell down onto the Stone Bridge at the start of the Time of Troubles . He was said to have guarded the walkway, in order to bar a number of malevolent deities from reaching the Celestial Stairway that had appeared in Waterdeep .</p>
