<p>Zox Clammersham was a rock gnome archmage and adventurer who settled within Undermountain during the 15 th century DR . He claimed a small lair that came to be known as Clammersham Palace , settled down and retired from the life of adventuring.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Following the death of his comrades, Zox was left alone within Trobriand's Graveyard of Undermountain. After some time, he gained the company of an amulet -less shield guardian known as Rex , who served as his bodyguard, along with a giant badger he kept as a pet.</p>
<p>Zox was extremely fearful of the hobgoblins that invaded the Graveyard during the 15 th century. He maintained a friendship with the local azer and lava children , who he referred to as the "burning men" and "smileys".</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>In addition to the ring that granted Zox control over the graveyard's scaladar , he kept a number of interesting and valuable items within his private chambers. He had a set of Nolzur's marvelous pigments and a small, ordinary music box that played a simple tune.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Zox and his adventuring party delved into Undermountain, but were mostly slain. Zox survived and settled into a life of solitude for some time, having lost all track of time along with any semblance of socialization. He managed to sustain himself on the fungi that grew near the lair of a nearby group of myconid .</p>
<p>Zox managed to claim one of Trobriand's rings , which allowed him control over the scaladar found within the Graveyard. Using them as a labor force, Zox managed to create the Simulacrux , a gargantuan machine that replicated scaladar by means of a modified simulacrum spell that used rust as its material component .</p>
