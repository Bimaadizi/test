<p>The lizardman was secretly recruited by Karne in the Zhentarim .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the lizardman shaman communed with the swamp, and its creatures told of the coming of adventurers . Among these creatures were the mudvipers , the carrion beetles , the hass-caw birds , and the rostfish . Apparently, the Onyx Tower had arrived in the Marsh of Chelimber, enraging all the lizardfolk but Sleyvas.</p>
<p>Sleyvas herded the three adventures— Kromlech Bruenghor , Vahn , and Adrianna —to him by placing a wall of vines along the snaking mud trail. He told the trio that he only wished for peace, and they were surprised that he was able to speak Common . He said this was because of the potent venom of the Sket'kah serpents. Sleyvas would squeeze the venom out of them and weave it into his magic . Once consumed, the words he spoke could be understood by anyone, or anything.</p>
<p>The adventurers asked why his people attacked him when they entered the marsh, but he told them that he was solitary, and these weren't his folk. He explained that the tower's owner, Eldrith , bestowed upon them metal weapons and the means to build siege weapons so that they could capture cities. Sleyvas implored the adventurers to seek out and kill Sess'sth , the leader of the lizardfolk. But once Eldrith was slain, there was one less enemy in the way of the greater plan of Sleyvas's master.</p>
