<p>Hidden Lake was a large body of water in ancient Netheril , surrounded by the Hidden Forest , the Lodestar Mountains , and the Shinantra Mountains . After Netheril fell, it dried up and became the salt pan known as the Shoal of Thirst . By the 15 th century DR following the return of Thultanthar , the lake had filled with water again and was known as the Shadow Sea .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Several rivers flowed from the surrounding Shinantra and Lodestar Mountains, through the Hidden Forest and into the lake, with none flowing out. These included the Cede Run , the gentle Dahla River , the cascading Kraal Brook , , the Tarn River , and the meandering Southfill River .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Packs of freshwater aquatic trolls dwelt in the extensive cave systems on the lake's southeastern shore, attacking anyone who came too close.</p>
<p>The forests were inhabited by several tribes of orcs , who warred mainly with the humans and local elves .</p>
<p>Pixies and sylphs in the forests around the lake prevented the Netherese from taking more wood than they needed to survive.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Treatise Historical of the Dragon Tyrants recounted that in −24,500 DR , the location of Hidden Lake was once a great mountain that contained the first kobold nation, Darastrixhurthi . Beneath the mountain were the gems that contained the souls that Garl Glittergold would use to create the gnome race. When kobolds began heedlessly mining the gems, Garl collapsed their caverns, transforming the mountain into the lake.</p>
<p>The elves of Hoyden built their village on the north shore inside the Hidden Forest in 473 NY (−3386 DR) , and lived in relative isolation throughout the tumultuous events to follow.</p>
<p>The Netherese settled extensively around around the lake, but their more aggressive deforestation plans were thwarted by the efforts of the native fey . Over the lengthy period of Netheril's history, the five settlements of Canlespiere ( 1004 NY (−2855 DR) ), Arisome ( 1137 NY (−2722 DR) ), Algid ( 1222 NY (−2637 DR) ), Trinity ( 1244 NY (−2615 DR) ), and Dahla River City ( 3365 NY (−494 DR) ) were built, though none survived long past the Fall of Netheril .</p>
<p>As recorded in Triumph Exemplar , a famous battle was fought at nearby Humaithira pass in 2298 NY (−1561 DR) , the Last Stand at Humaithira . After a gruelling fight in the mountains, the giants led by Blóta pressed on to the shore of Hidden Lake, leading to a final battle near Trinity that defeated the giants.</p>
<p>As the lands of Netheril turned to waste under the assault of the phaerimms , the Hidden Lake eventually dried up, becoming the Shoal of Thirst salt pan in the Great Sand Sea .</p>
<p>In 1372 DR , with the return of the Shadovar , three Princes of Shade performed a ritual that created a huge storm above the Shoal , and it refilled the lake, which became known as the Shadow Sea .</p>
