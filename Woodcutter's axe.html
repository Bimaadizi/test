<p>Woodcutter's axes were enchanted tools of lumberjacks's trade in the Moonsea region.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These magic woodcutter's axes were created to increase the work efficiency of individual lumberjacks as hands-on logging was the most efficient method. The enchantments placed on woodcutter's axes guided the weapon towards the "sweet spot" on the target's body. This effectively was a +2 enchantment when wielded in battle. The same magic made these aces especially deadly against various shapechanger foes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , woodcutter's axes were used by lumberjacks in the Moonsea region and the city of Voonlar . One such weapon could be found stuck in a tree stump on the outskirts of Voonlar circa the Order of the Crippled Fang crisis and a devastating fiend assault on the city.</p>
