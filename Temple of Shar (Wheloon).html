<p>The Temple of Shar in Wheloon was a center of Sharran worship, controlled by the priestess Storna Harnwood , and headquarters of the Night Brigade gang during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The temple was an expansive, fortified, well-built structure. Its foundations were built atop the ruins of the former homes of the Riverside Rats , and the rubble and remains of their existence could still be found in the lower levels.</p>
<p>One chamber comprised a deep pit filled with garbage and covered with shadows, and the flock were told that leaping into it would lead to the sweet embrace of oblivion. Instead, they would simply add their corpses to the hidden heap of refuse.</p>
<p>In Storna's "treasury", she kept the loot that she had won over years of service but considered it of little worth compared to her divine service. She instead left it with living shadows , which "played" with her heaps of coins.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Storna used the temple to sway and recruit Wheloon prisoners, increasing her power and that of the gang. In addition to her regular living followers, she was aided and protected by umbral gargoyles and other shadow monstrosities.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The temple was built atop the homes of the Riverside Rats gang, and became a symbol of the Night Brigade's power. When the Rats finally set up a counter-offensive, they began with the lesser officers of the gang, taking out Battlemaster Agarta the Breaker , Master Thief Karissa the Knife , and Grand Arcanist Darstil Vurusk , who each controlled an area of expertise in the gang. Realising the incoming danger, Storna had the Temple of Shar locked up, preventing any visitors or invaders from entering. On their approach the Rat's allies found the Selûnite Brunwell Godber outside the temple, who gave auspicious moon-related advice and promised that Selûne would make herself known. They then used their rat talismans to bypass the defenses and sneak into the temple, cutting through the defenders as they went. They encountered multiple opportunities to banish Shar's darkness along the way, until by the end the temple was well-lit by Selûne's light. Storna was found and fought, and accepted her end as one of Shar's humble servants. Without Storna as their leader, the Night Brigade assuredly crumbled, sparing Wheloon their torments and allowing the Riverside Rats to return to their homes.</p>
