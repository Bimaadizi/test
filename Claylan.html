<h2>History</h2>
<p>Count Claylan was a married man who spent his time seducing naive debutantes at the exclusive Mithrest inn located in the Waukeen's Promenade . Lady Lasalla was one of Claylan's conquests. He grew tired of the woman in a week, leaving her brokenhearted. She later felt annoyed at other debutantes who eagerly accepted the Count's advances. In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Alicia Paalater found herself being courted by the Count and eagerly reciprocated. The young woman was enamored with the nobleman, praising his bravery after listening to the Count's tales and being impressed by his supposed influence over the Council of Six and Lord Ophal . He was planning to petition the Council to prohibit commoners from shopping at the Waukeen's Promenade during the day. Alicia was invited to visit Count Claylan's manor the same evening to view his collection of Sunite statuary. The nobleman insisted that her parents did not need to be distracted from their daily activities for a visit, especially since Claylan's wife was away from the manor.</p>
