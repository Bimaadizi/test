<p>Later the same year, both forces of the tribe and the cult encountered a a group of adventurers from Phlan making their way to the center of the ruins, Castle Cormanthor to stop the cult's nefarious plans of conquering he Moonsea region.

Soon after Zud's death, his hated opponent Mol fell to the same group of adventurers..</p>
