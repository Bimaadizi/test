<p>Dodos were a species of small flightless birds that were quite common in some areas of the world.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>The good folk of the Blade Kingdoms and the city-state of Sumbria were familiar with dodos. These birds were considered to be dull-witted and sometimes the word was used to describe a person lacking intelligence.</p>
<p>Outside of Toril , dodos were considered boringly common domesticated birds.</p>
