<p>A court scepter was a scepter used in Cormanthor .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Per the Srinshee , a court scepter could be used to read the powers of spells and duplicate them. However, it had limited charges.</p>
<p>Elminster later used the scepter to duplicate a spell cast earlier that evening rather than one as it was cast. He also used it to create green light, or a purple-white glow that revealed magic. The scepter could also be used to store a copy of an ongoing spell and reveal its powers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Srinshee gave one such scepter to Elminster Aumar in 241Â DR prior to his standing in for the Coronal for a revel in the Hallows . Elminster later used the spell duplication power of the scepter to replicate the body switch spell that the Srinshee had cast prior, to substitute himself for Elandorr Waelvor . He used the scepter later to create a ring of fire around himself, when beset by many angry revelers who believed him to have been responsible for the explosion at the Narnpool . Later that evening, he employed the scepter to determine the properties of a field during his Hunt. He spent some power from the scepter in order to power a different spell afterwards.</p>
