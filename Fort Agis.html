<p>Fort Agis , also known as Memnonnar Citadel , was one of the border keeps of Tethyr , collectively known as the Calimmon Garrisons.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This fort was located two miles north of Memnon on the edge of the ruins of Memnonnar .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Like most of the Calimmon Garrisons, this non-elaborate fortress was built from huge stones. Its walls were ten-to-fifteen-feet thick (3.0â€“4.6 meters) and 20 feet high (6.1 meters) with a deep, empty moat around them.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Due to its proximity to one of Calimshan 's major cities and one of its most dangerous ruins, Fort Agis was defended with a greater complement of troops than its sister garrisons. Around 300 Tethyrian soldiers were stationed there.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of 1370 DR , the fort was approximately 600 years old.</p>
