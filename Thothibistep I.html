<p>Thothibistep I was the ninth pharaoh of Mulhorand and one of the first to not be a physical incarnation of the Mulhorandi god Horus-Re , but rather the god Thoth .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thothibistep I was born in 861 DR . He ascended to the throne of pharaoh of Mulhorand in 922 DR , after the former pharaoh Ramenhorus II had died in battle against the Red Wizards of Thay during a half-hearted attempt to prevent the nation from seceding from the Second Mulhorand Empire , which left Mulhorand with no living incarnations of Horus-Re left. He intended to rule as pharaoh only until a suitable incarnation of Horus-Re could take the throne.</p>
<p>Thothibistep I's reign lasted until 925 DR , when he was slain by the wizard Namrek following the Spelldoom .</p>
