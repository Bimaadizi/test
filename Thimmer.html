<p>Thimmer was a food item found in Khôltar , south Faerûn , circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This hearty dish was made from boar and other animal meats cut into thin strips and fried in a pan along with diced sausage . After the meat was cooked and removed from the pan, the drippings were used to make the gravy . A hardrusk bun was then filled with the pan-fry and topped with gravy. The bun was a bowl -shaped loaf of bread with a large cavity and a flat bottom, over-baked until the crust was hard. Thimmer could be found at Munsrum's Ready Ladle on the North Way near Handrornlar, the north gate into Khôltar, the Iron City. It sold for 3 silver pieces per serving. This dish was Munsrum's version of what many locals fixed at home.</p>
