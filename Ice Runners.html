<p>The Ice Runners were two large land-bound warships designed for the purpose of navigating the Great Glacier .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Ice Runners sported sails that were over 70 yards (64 meters) wide. The bottom of the ships were fitted with enormous razor-sharp blades, allowing them to skid across the ice of the Great Glacier.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Ice Runners were built by a fire giant king in the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR for a frost giant jarl in the Ice Spires , whom he had lost to in a wine drinking contest held at a hill giant encampment. They were presented to the jarl at Twilight's Vale . In the years that followed, the frost giants of the Ice Spires would use them to conduct numerous raids upon the people of the Cold Lands .</p>
<p>In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR the then-jarl of the frost giants, Ryndölg , sent men out on the Ice Runners for many months in search of the fabled Hartkiller's Horn .</p>
