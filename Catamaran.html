<p>Catamarans were a type of watercraft design that used twinned hulls instead of one, and could scale from small boats to large ships.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>By using two hulls together, a catamaran boat or ship achieved better stability and speed, though maneuvrability was more limited. It also suffered a lack of space inside the hull or atop the deck, reducing its capacity for passengers or cargo.</p>
