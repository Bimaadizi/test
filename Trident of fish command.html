<p>The tridents of fish command were polearms that could gain control fish and command them in a limited fashion.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These tridents were 6‑foot-long (1.8‑meter) barbed military forks.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The wielder of the trident could attempt to gain control of all fish within a 60‑foot (18‑meter) radius from the wielder. Those fish unable to resist would become completely under the empathetic command of the wielder, and would not attack the wielder nor anyone else within 10 feet (3 meters) of the trident. The fish could be commanded to swim as the wielder wished or harass an enemy. Those fish who resisted the power of the trident, would still be unable to come within 10 feet (3 meters) of it. Besides fish, the power also affected sharks and eels , but mollusks, crustaceans, and other types of non-piscine creatures would remain unaffected.</p>
