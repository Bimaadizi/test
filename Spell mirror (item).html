<p>A spell mirror was an enchanted protective device.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Spell mirrors were ovoid devices made of polished glass.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A spell mirror was keyed against a single spell , and deflected any instance of that spell aimed at the one carrying it away. The deflection was always somewhere past them, equidistant from the point of origin, and at an angle of 45 degrees.</p>
<p>Though the spell mirror had no limit on the spells it could reflect, there was a significant chance, about 1 in 12, of it crumbling away into dust, releasing both a blast of damaging force and an angry creature bound to the mirror, which would inevitably turn on the bearer.</p>
<p>Creatures bound up in such mirrors included firestars , will-o'-wisps , or volts .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These mirrors were common in Oerth , where they were as old as the practice of wizardry. Mordenkainen once brought one to a moot with Elminster Aumar and Dalamar on Earth .</p>
