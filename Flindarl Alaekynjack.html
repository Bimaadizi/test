<p>Flindarl Alaekynjack was the proprietor of the Walking Out to Meet the Dragon drinking establishment in Mosstone , Tethyr , in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Flindarl was the man who built the tavern and named it after the bravest thing he's ever done - covered in cold sweat of terror, he walked out to meet a marauding dragon , as a distraction for an adventuring band. The dragon saw no danger in the terrified man and pounced to play with its food. Even though Flindarl was injured and crippled by the dragon's maw, he survived the battle thanks to the adventurers who ended the wyrm's rampage with swords and spells . Alaekynjack received his share of the dragon's hoard and used it to build one of the best taverns in Tethyr. He offered a warm welcome to half-orcs , adventurers, disfigured folk, outcasts, and other people who might've been given the cold shoulder anywhere else. By the end of Flindarl Alaekynjack's life, he had a lot of close friends and was beloved and respected by all. He passed several years after his wife perished from a strange fever. As of the late 14 th century DR , Flindarl's mountain of a daughter, Kardeera Alaekynjack , ran her father's establishment and was just as friendly and beloved as her old man.</p>
