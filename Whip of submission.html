<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A whip of submission possessed enchantments that, upon a successful strike, had a chance of demoralizing their targets. The feeling of despair and hopelessness that consumed affected creatures caused them to stop fighting and surrender. The duration of this magical effect was between two and eight minutes. Each whip held ten charges of these magics. Additionally, such whips possessed a simple +1 enchantment that aided the wielder's hand and made slashes with the weapon more deadly.</p>
