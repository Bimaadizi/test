<p>Aeraldoth was a djinn vizier of the Grand Caliph. He volunteered to be imprisoned by Martek in order to do battle with Khalitharius upon his release.</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>Before his release, the voice of his mental cry was soft and deep. Upon release, Aeraldoth appeared at a height of 30 ft (9.1 m).</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Aeraldoth's lightning bolts were far deadlier than most mortal magic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Aeraldoth had previous encounters with Khalitharius before the efreet was imprisoned. During an audience in which the Grand Caliph entertained Martek, his ire rose to a breaking point upon learning of the efreet's eventual release. He learned that all Martek could do was leave a djinn of great power for the adventurers to release shortly after they released the efreet; this could not be a bound efreet, however, as any genie that Martek could bind would not be a match for Khalitharius' power. As Martek begged the Caliph to advise him, Aeraldoth begged the Caliph to allow him to be bound so that he may have the opportunity to confront and battle Khalitharius; afterwards he volunteered to let himself be bound.</p>
<p>While imprisoned, Aeraldoth spent a thousand years preparing himself for the battle, though he could not win. Aeraldoth's prison was a bottle; he could not be released without a magical word, as removing the stopper did nothing. The word was hidden as a combination of the contents of the sign on the palm of Princess Shadalah and the Amulet of the Oasis of the White Palm. The bottle could not be taken further than a hundred feet from its location, either, for it would teleport back: it was found beneath a statue of Set in the City of Phoenix . After Khalitharius was released in 1356 DR , his cry for release was mentally audible up until adventurers were able to break his imprisonment.</p>
<p>Aeraldoth was released only weeks after Khalitharius. He battled the efreet all across the Raurin until Martek was resurrected and became able to step in, quickly defeating the exhausted efreet.</p>
