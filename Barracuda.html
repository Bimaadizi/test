<p>Barracudas were a type of carnivorous fish that inhabited warm salt water.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They were slender creatures with long jagged teeth poking out from a noticeable underbite. Their bodies were shaped like arrows, able to move very fast in water, the better to dart into range, bite their prey, then disappear just as suddenly.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Barracudas typically did not attack humanoid creatures. However, they occasionally would attack humanoids carrying shiny objects, out of a mistaken belief that said object was a small fish they could prey upon. They could be very aggressive and vicious.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Barracudas were lightning-quick predators, attacking any prey that was injured or appeared helpless. Occasionally they would use their speed to launch themselves out of the water and bite at creatures on a boat.</p>
