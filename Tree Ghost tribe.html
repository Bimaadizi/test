<p>The Tree Ghost tribe were an Uthgardt barbarian band that lived in the High Forest and served as the keepers of the Grandfather Tree . While they were not often seen by outsiders, they lived in harmony with the native elves and Uthgardt tribesmen from other tribes.</p>
<p>They claimed the Grandfather Tree as their ancestral mound , and built a camp nearby.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Under Chief Orcbane, the Tree Ghost tribe led raids against Iceshield orc settlements along the edge of the High Forest.</p>
<h2>Leadership</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , the tribe was led by Great Chief Boorvald Orcbane .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime after 1311 DR , the spirits of the Grandfather Tree exiled the Blue Bear tribe away from its location in the High Forest for having grown corrupted by the influence of an annis hag named Tanta Hagara , who posed as their shaman.</p>
<p>A significant number of the Blue Bear tribesmen would grow to reject the annis and in 1313 DR splintered off into their own tribe, the Tree Ghosts. Thereafter, both tribes devoted themselves to searching for their lost and abandoned ancestral mound.</p>
<p>With the help of their tribe's oral history and clues to its location in Mintiper Moonsilver 's narrative epic Tree Ghosts , the crippled shaman Chungred Ghostheart led the Tree Ghosts tribe in their search of the tree. After six decades of searching, they rediscovered Grandfather Tree on the day of Shieldmeet , in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR . They reclaimed their ancestral home, establishing a camp close by it.</p>
<p>In their efforts to establish a camp the tribe received aid from several green elves , as well as backing by Alustriel Silverhand , the ruler of Silverymoon . A few months later the Tree Ghost's held their first Runemeet in generations and the then-chieftain, Gunthar Longwood , forged alliances with the forest's various inhabitants, including the elves , treants , satyrs , and dryads .</p>
<p>The tribal leaders refused to allow any former Blue Bear members to rejoin their tribe, for they believed that the destruction of their tribe was an act of divine punishment by Uthgardt for their wicked ways and that welcoming any former members would incite his wrath.</p>
