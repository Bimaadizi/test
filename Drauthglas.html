<p>Drauthglas was a noble house of Cormyr . The bloodline ended with the passing of Eltrym Drauthglas in the Year of the Dragon Altar, 1202 DR .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The family home was Hullack Hall , located about a mile (1.6 kilometers) below the northern border of the Hullack Forest , just west of a north-south line through the midpoint of the forest.</p>

<p>The Drauthglas family resisted becoming part of Cormyr, but finally surrendered after the last heir was slain in battle. King Pryntaler allowed Eltrym to keep his title and his authority over the forest. The Drauthglas family became Cormyrean nobles.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime around the Year of the Poisoned Quill, 1190 DR , the Purple Dragons took the Hullack Forest for Cormyr, defeating the Lord of Hullack in battle. Eltrym surrendered to King Pryntaler to protect Hullack Hall and his six daughters after all four of his sons and heirs were slain in the fighting.</p>
