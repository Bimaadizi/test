<p>The Book of Shadows was a spellbook and tome based upon the oration of the necromancer Nebt Bhakau of Zakhara that served as one of the more complete treatises on the dark art of necromancy .</p>

These included Abi-Dalzim's horrid wilting , Beltyn's burning blood , blackmantle , bone blight , bone club , brainkill , chill touch , choke , conflagration , contagion , corpse visage , dead man's eyes , death link , deathshroud , death ward , death spell , defoliate , energy drain , enervation , exterminate , finger of death , flame of justice , ghoul gauntlet , ghoul touch , Grimwald's greymantle , lich touch , mummy rot , mummy touch , pain touch , rain of blood , shadow form , skull trap , suffocate , summon shadow , throbbing bones , vampiric touch , energy drain , and wail of the banshee .</p>
<p>The tome also included information regarding the raising of crawling claws , enslaving evil genies , summoning fiends from the outer planes , and subjugating multiple skeleton warriors simultaneously. Recipes for otherwise forgotten poisons and necromantic devices were covered within the book, including detailed instructions for creating gloom candles and partial instructions for crafting bone rings . It made only a passing reference to the creation of crypt things .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As Nebt lay in an oubliette awaiting his execution, he shared his thoughts on necromancy with his few minor shadow familiars who had not deserted him, and these servants used that information to create the Book of Shadows . The tome soon began circulating in nearby cities, and was immediately banned. Although many of the original copies were rounded up and destroyed by Zakharan authorities, several survived.</p>
<p>The Scabrous Society used recipes from the book to help them expand their evil operations.</p>
