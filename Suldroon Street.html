<p>Suldroon Street was a prominent street in Khôltar , south Faerûn , circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Like nearly all streets in the Iron City, it was paved with cobblestones.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Suldroon was a major east–west thoroughfare that ran the full width of the city until it reached the inner walls and the unnamed lane that circumnavigated the town, servicing all the guard towers. It was north of, and parallel to, Erethorn's Ride , and intersected both Orntathtar Way and the North Way . Near the middle of its course, the Iron Way formed a T-intersection heading south to High Khôltar .</p>
<p>The portion of Suldroon near the Iron Way was clustered with the opulently carved klathlaaedin (stone mansions) of the Onsruur (council of lords), but in smaller numbers than at the other end of the Iron Way where it intersected Erethorn's Ride. The area surrounding High Khôltar was known as "Deepcoin" to the locals. Farther out from the center, huge residential towers called "greatfists" were the dwellings of successful merchants and socialites. Approaching North Way and Orntathtar Way, and beyond to the walls, the buildings became more business oriented than residential, tending to shops, warehouses, crafters, forges, and costers.</p>
