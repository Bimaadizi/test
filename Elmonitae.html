<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in the mid-14 th century DR , the neogi had imprisoned 100 captives on Elmonitae: 60 elves and 40 humans from Wa . The tsunami Storm of Honor , commanded by Daimyo Akahu Nagasa , fought against six neogi mindspiders , destroying four and causing the remaining two to flee after a 28-hour-long battle. The ship then landed on Elmonitae and rescued the prisoners. The elven captives were then transferred to the armada Wings of Glory , ushering a five-year-long peace between the elves and the nation of Wa.</p>
