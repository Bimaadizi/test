<p>The Elixir of the Void was a poisonous concoction that was used by the Church of Shar in their initiation rituals.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Despite its grand name, the elixir was actually very mundane. It was a mixture of poison and strong alcohol such as wine , intended to mask the poison's bitter taste.</p>
<p>The Church of Shar would use the Elixir to ensure the outcome of a prospective Sharran's initiation ritual. After being welcomed into the temple, the initiate was presented with the elixir to drink, and forced to consume if they did not do so willingly. The initiation would then proceed to test their willingness to serve the church, with the poisoned individual in an altered state of mind as they slowly succumbed. Once the initiate had performed to the presiding priest's satisfaction (such as by ritually murdering a captured loved one or other innocent), the priest would neutralize the poison , saving their life and giving them their first direct experience with Shar's divine power .</p>
<p>If the initiate failed to impress or lost their nerve, then there was no risk of them escaping and betraying the church, as they would shortly die anyway of what would seem to be an alcohol-related illness.</p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>In the short term, ingesting the mixture of poison and strong alcohol caused disorientation and general confusion, making the victim more suggestible and easier to control. In the long term, the Elixir would have lethal effects for the initiate if it were not purged or neutralized.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Keph Thingoleir was forced to drink the Elixir when he joined the temple of Shar in Yhaunn in 1373 DR .</p>
