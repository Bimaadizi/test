<p>Griffons were intelligent beasts with the body of a lion and the wings, forelegs, and head of an eagle.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A griffon had the body of a lion with the head and wings of an eagle . The forelimbs of the griffon were often like those of an eagle, ending in sharp talons, but this was not always the case. Just as lions and eagles had varying physical characteristics based on where in the world they are found, so too did griffons. An adult griffon was about 8 feet (2.4 meters) long, with a wingspan of 25 feet (7.6 meters). The average griffon weighed about 500 lb (230,000 g). Expectedly, griffons, and their lairs exuded a mix of two smells: a musky odor of great cats and the scent of falconer 's mews.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Griffons were known to be somewhat intelligent creatures, though had a penchant for aggression. Young griffons were generally not combative.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Young griffons were known as fledglings. They were considered fully grown after three years. A griffon could fly 72 miles in a day, broken up into three sets of three hour flights with one hour rests in between.</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Griffons were carnivorous creatures. Their favorite animal to prey upon was horses . They would often attack them when within sight or smelling distance.</p>
<p>Griffons had milk and suckled their young. The milk tasted like cream cheese or mild Gouda, with the flavor getting stronger as the mother aged.</p>
<h3>Homelands</h3>
<p>Griffons typically made their nests in homes in high rocky places like cliffs, as well as open caverns set in hills and mountain regions, such as the Storm Horns in Cormyr .</p>
<p>When acquainted with humans, they were usually stabled in airy, doorless stone halls, vaguely resembling their lairs.</p>
<p>In the Unapproachable East , they nested at the highest reaches of the Tannath mountains and Umbergoth . They could also be found around the coastal regions and interior uplands of Aglarond .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>When tamed and raised at a young age they could become very loyal and fierce mounts. Because of this they were highly sought after, with eggs fetching prices of around 2,000 gp and fledglings for around 5,000 gp.</p>
<h2>Mounts</h2>
<p>Griffons were commonly found as mounts throughout the Realms. Some notable examples:</p>
<h2>Use</h2>
<p>Griffon feathers could be used to make quills. This variety was a preferred ingredient for scribing fly spells.</p>
