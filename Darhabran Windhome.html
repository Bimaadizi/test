<h2>History</h2>
<p>Darhabran Windhome had been an old hand by 1357Â DR . Late that year he was one of Orthil Voldovan 's guards for the trip between Scornubel and Waterdeep . Before they reached Triel , he was already suggesting slaying Shandril Shessair , the spellfire wielder who joined their caravan, so that all those who came snatching after her would not attack it anymore. Orthil told him he'd considered it, but he needed spellfire in case of more bandits.</p>
