<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thiszult was sent by the Cult of the Dragon to capture Shandril Shessair in 1357 DR , on Flamerule 9 . Knowing she had too much of a head start, he teleported to the Rising Moon with a warrior on tow rather than ride the rest of the way; at the inn, Korvan told him Shandril wasn't much further ahead.</p>
<p>Definitive accounts show that the warrior he took along during teleportation stayed behind with Korvan and attacked Gorstag ; the mage instead stole a horse and slew all the others with lightning. Thiszult himself was ambushed by the Malaugrym Architrave , which he escaped with the same spells, only to get too close to Shargailar and be struck with lightning breath on the spot, on Flamerule 9 too. Earlier accounts of his exploits claimed he slew himself by flying and turning invisible while in pursuit of Shandril, which aroused the attention of Shargrailar ; the dracolich slew him instantly with a lightning breath before he could explain he was an ally.</p>
