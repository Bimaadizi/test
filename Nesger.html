<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nesger hurriedly reported to Belgon Bradaskor in late 1357Â DR , badly injured and weary beyond measure, regarding Orthil Voldovan 's caravan in which Shandril Shessair was traveling at the moment. He mentioned that there were entirely too many wizards, and that Shandril's spellfire was slaying them all, and torching the wagons too. He claimed he'd back her against anyone, then staggered away without elaborating.</p>
