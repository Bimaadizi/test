<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ograth was an unusually large orcish man.</p>
<h2>Posessions</h2>
<p>Ograth carried an enchanted +1 halberd and a magical +2 dagger .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Ograth's marauders preyed on the travelers and caravans that moved along the coastal roads in the environs of Neverwinter . He sought to perform a mystic ritual called the Eye of the Gruumsh , in which a powerful orc honors his deity by plucking his own eye out and then slaughtering someone or something. If Ograth were to perform the ritual, his bloodthirsty ray may have had led him to attack a band of adventurers who worked with merchant Sa'Sani or a camp of Eldreth Veluuthra .</p>
