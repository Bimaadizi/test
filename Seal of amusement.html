<p>The seal of amusement was a unique enchanted coin crafted by Laeral Silverhand for Jarlaxle in the late 15 th century DR . It was one of many pieces of so-called " Silverhand gear " crafted for adventurers who helped to protect Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The coin could spin eternally, although it was unclear if Silverhand originally gave it any additional properties. Jarlaxe, finding the trinket amusing, sharpened the coin's edges to a razor's edge, and would use it to prank gambling partners and pickpockets. Injuries from the cruelly whimsical weapon left lasting injuries.</p>
