<p>Hideous was a quality that could be applied to armor or a shield that made the wearer more fearsome.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A hideous armor or shield used a lot of gruesome-looking decoration like scalps, bones, skulls, dried viscera, etc . They gave off a smell of rancid meat and had illusory flies audibly buzzing around the decorations.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A hideous armor or shield made a person more competent at intimidating others. This property grew in intensity with the amount of money and personal essence that the creator was willing to spend on the armor.</p>
<p>However, this fearsome nature had a cost in the form of deteriorated diplomatic abilities.</p>
<p>Creating a hideous armor or shield required the caster to be good at intimidation him- or herself, but no specific spell . It did not even require better skill at spellcasting to create a better suit, only the willingness to spend material wealth and the crafter's personal essence.</p>
