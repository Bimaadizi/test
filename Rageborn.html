<p>A rageborn was a type of demon . The vast majority of rageborn were found within the 23 rd layer of the Abyss , the Iron Wastes . With the rise of Kostchtchie to power came a massive increase in rageborn numbers, and they all served Kostchtchie.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Rageborn were not particularly intelligent, but were instead creatures of raw fury and eternal hunger. They delighted in violence and excelled at inflicting it. While they were not known to seek out allies unless forced to do so, they were known to rove the Iron Wastes in bands, mindlessly and hungrily attacking anything they encountered.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>A rageborn's battle cry was said to be infused with the dark will of Kostchtchie. Different types of rageborn possessed different forms of elemental magic , and some also possessed a powerful leaping ability that they used to quickly attack their enemies.</p>
<p>All rageborn possessed an ability to adapt to and resist the first type of any elemental magic that targeted them.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>The rageborn fought with a mixture of magic and their bare claws. Some, known as "frosthurlers", made use of frozen bolts to keep their foes under fire as the larger and tougher among them would close the distance to rend them apart. Even these ranged attackers, however, were ferocious in close-combat.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first rageborn in the Abyss emerged from raging storms that swept through the Iron Wastes when the demon lord Kostchtchie first seized the layer for his own. They were unswervingly faithful to Kostchtchie (or at least, their loyalty seemed to be a manifestation of his absolute control over the Iron Wastes), and so the demon lord would send rageborn to serve his frost giant cultists on the Prime Material plane .</p>
<p>On occasion, a rageborn might stumble across a hidden portal in the Iron Wastes that took them to some other land, where the rageborn would wreak havoc.</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , a powerful artifact of Orcus that once belonged to Zhengyi the Witch-King possessed the ability to summon rageborn servants to defend itself.</p>
