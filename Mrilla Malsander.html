<p>Mrilla Malsander was the head of House Malsander of Waterdeep in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Her chin was shaven and powdered. During her meeting with Lady Sylull Cassalanter in 1369 DR, her clothes included throat lace and a collar she needed to straighten. To Halaster Blackcloak , she growled a lot, while Dumathchess Ilchoas and Qilué Veladorn described her voice as a harsh, raven -like croak.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Mrilla was greedy and thrustingly ambitious, aiming to join the nobility, but still rather incurious, being willing to invest as directed by another without asking why.</p>
<p>She liked treats such as Shou ginger dipped in Maztican chocolate .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>As the head of the family, the Malsander properties were Mrilla's.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>She liked to spend an hour every morning reading the exploits of Elradra from the Silk Mask Saga with chocolate and ginger . She directed the family business, and also did much of Auvrarn's bidding.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She served a conspiracy in which she was outranked by Auvrarn Labraster as his liaison with Brelma and investing proxy. Later in 1369 DR, she attained enough of a rank within the cabal that she began to have mail from it instead of acting solely as a pass-through between Brelma and Auvrarn.</p>
<p>Her seneschal was called Jalarn . They didn't like each other, until Mrilla was enspelled with a spell of carnal attraction for him.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 1360s DR , Mrilla Malsander was known to be one of the most ambitious rich merchants vying for nobility in Waterdeep . In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , she met with the slaver Brelma one evening, whereupon she was unknowingly overheard by the Harper Dumathchess Ilchoas and the drow Chosen of Mystra , Qilué Veladorn.</p>
<p>Within maybe a day, she received a visit from Laeral Silverhand , disguised as Sylull Cassalanter , who cast a spell on her to compel Mrilla to drag her feet on all she did for Auvrarn Labraster, while telling her to cut off all contact if she still meant to become a noblewoman. The spell also made her develop an infatuation for her seneschal, Jalarn.</p>
<p>Months later, Mrilla was using a mail service for the cabal. At the time of Halaster's defection from the conspiracy, she had not checked her mail in a while.</p>
<h3>Aftermath</h3>
<p>The roll of Waterdeep's noble houses as of 1372 DR did not include the Malsander family.</p>
