<p>The Parentree was a monumental temple of Corellon built in the city of Cormanthor . It was considered to be the most-holy of temples in the entirety of the Cormanthyrian empire.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It was located in the northwestern part of the city's Sheshyrinnam district.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>This breathtaking twelve-story cathedral was built within the hollowed-out form of a gigantic shadowtop tree that had been transformed into ivory by means of elven high magic . The great temple-tree was 100 ft (30 m) wide at its base, and stood some 400 ft (120 m) tall at its apex, which had been opened up to the skies above.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Parentree was the site for the city's celebrations of the major holidays associated with the Seldarine . On occasion it did play host to private wedding ceremonies, but only for members of the noble Cormanthyrian families.</p>
<p>Corellon's Choir sang from a position at the temple's ground floor, a position that allowed their choruses to echo throughout the concavity of the ivory tree's interior. Magical enhancements allowed for their songs to resonate far beyond the temple's walls to the People that listened outside.</p>
