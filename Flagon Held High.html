<p>The Flagon Held High was a tavern in Tilverton in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Flagon was located in the eastern part of the Old Town on the hilltop, towards the end of Phorn's Lane .</p>
<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
<p>The Flagon was something of an ongoing festival, where people of all types came to meet, drink, and eat. The tavern wasn't large enough to contain all the patrons, and the eating, drinking, singing and dancing often extended to the lane outside. It was attended by all strata of society and managed to keep a civil and peaceful atmosphere. Because of this, it obtained a reputation as a safe "neutral site" where people could meet without attracting gossip.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Flagon provided a wide selection of fine beers and fine entertainment, with professional joke-tellers, dancers, minstrels, escorts, and thieves working the patrons. Easy-going Purple Dragons watched the outgoing crowds each night, directing lost and befuddled customers back to their lodgings.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>A fire around 1367 DR resulted in the tavern being rebuilt and renovated, with the cellars supplied by a winch-tunnel that ran from Drakar Lane below the Old Town knoll. The stone walls were smooth and the sign freshly painted, self-evidently new in the following years.</p>
