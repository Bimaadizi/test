<p>Black Blood cultists were tribal barbarians who revered and served the lycanthropes of the People of the Black Blood . They were among the most dangerous members of the so-called Cults of the Moon .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Black Blood cultists were harbingers of destruction who yearned to unleash their base, animalistic urges when and wherever they could, and were said to commit acts of brutality beyond the ken of what most civilized folk could imagine. These evil barbarians worshiped Malar and idolized the shapeshifting lycanthropes of the brutal People of the Black Blood, believing them to be the paragon of their own bestial aspirations. Although their reverence went unrecognized by the lycanthropes themselves, such cultists drew power from their veneration, and became increasingly bestial; they imitated the corrupt nature of their masters. Many gravitated to the path of a Black Blood cultist either out of tribal tradition or personal experiences with lycanthropes that left them in awe or in life-changing terror.</p>
<p>These cultists saw themselves as protectors of the natural order, and to embrace the natural phenomena of death, hunger, and loss, and were seen as nature's avengers among those who venerated Malar or his lycanthropes. They spent much of their time either training, hunting, or venerating Malar, although some cultists also venerated Talona or totemic animal gods . While they sought to eliminate those who failed to opposed Malar or who had not been touched by his power, they were largely territorial, and their attacks on settled lands were most often retaliatory rather than expansionist. They relentlessly pursued any who harmed their allies, chasing them even beyond the bounds of their own territory and until it became clear that they had lost their prey's trail.</p>
<p>When faced with danger, they lived by the mantra of kill or be killed, and attacked with shocking speed and brutality. They fought in close quarters and commonly eschewed weapons, preferring instead to grapple their enemies and to rend flesh with their hands and teeth. They reveled in inflicting terrible injuries, even if it meant risking great harm to themselves.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Most individuals who would be recognized as Black Blood cultists hailed from the Uthgardt tribes of the North , but some arose among other uncivilized, wild barbarians of Faerûn and could be found as far as Chult in the south and Cormanthor in the east. Most Black Blood cultists hailed from barbarian tribes or cults dedicated to Malar, and thus becoming a true cultists was seen as following in the steps of their ancestors. Such tribal cultists were often the most fearsome as they had been raised since childhood to embrace their inner beasts. Aside from their veneration of the People of the Black Blood, the most important things to a Black Blood cultist were their tribe and their territory. Most cultists, assuming they proved their strength, could count on support and aid from their fellow tribesfolk. They were uncomfortable in settled lands, and could not relate to the comforts and fears of civilized folk.</p>
<p>The transformation into a true Black Blood cultist was guided by the Malarite shamans who led their tribe (generally an evil druid or sorcerer ), who helped to connect the aspirant's spirit to their inner beast. Only those willing and able to give themselves over to rage and bloodlust in battle could become a true Black Blood cultist. Some rangers were found among their ranks, as well as the rare druid unable to resist the draw of the savage lycanthropes. The rituals to become a true cultists included subjecting oneself to repeated injury, from crawling through thorns to breaking their bones from great falls, and allowing these wounds to heal with the help of special ointments that strengthened their bodies and natural weapons. The transformation left scars that wild beasts and other savage entities honored as signs of the cultist's status. Those who had not grown up in one of the tribes that practiced these rites could only become a Black Blood cultist by first being accepted into such a tribe, which required its own series of dangerous and bloody trials to prove their worth (these often included solo hunts of great beasts and tests of survival in lands prowled by hostile lycanthropes).</p>
<p>Many filed their teeth into sharp points.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Cultists of the Black Blood gained a variety of abilities that increased their power and frenzied ferocity. They used these powers to constantly attack civilized beings.</p>
<p>These barbaric cultists could strengthen the bones and muscles of their fingers, as well as their nails, in order to use them as viable weapons in battle. As the cultists became more experienced in this ability, they could use their teeth as natural weapons, as well as rend their enemies with their both of their clawed hands: it was said that their unarmed savagery could inflict as grievous wounds as any blade . Over time, they became more even more bestial in other ways, with their skin becoming thicker (save for against silvered weapons) and their sense of smell becoming more acute.</p>
<p>Whilst raging, cultists of the Black Blood could use their teeth to snap their enemies' necks. Those who had learned to control their rage could use natural weapons at any given time.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>These cultists kept very few possessions. They did not collect gold , material goods, or other things that civilized folk would see as valuable, and they rarely made use of weapons. That said, they were known to keep magic items that they found, especially those that made them more dangerous in battle, but were wary that they could lose face with their tribe if they were seen as relying more on magic than on their own natural powers.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Black Blood cultists were the sworn enemies of all civilized folk, and if ever the two met, the cultists would ensure that only one survived. The despised evil civilizations as much as any other. While it was possible to arrange an audience with leaders of a tribe, they almost never agreed to meet with someone who was not closely tied to nature, and any visit to their territory might entail a life-or-death test of the visitor's mettle. Most folk who lived near a tribe knew little about them save that they were animalistic raiders.</p>
<p>Each tribe of cultists was independent from the rest, and each had different relationships to the People of the Black Blood in their home regions. Although they venerated the lycanthropes, the People were largely unconcerned with them. In recognition of their veneration of Malar and of nature, the lycanthropes tolerated the tribes to share their territory unless they came to be seen as disruptive, in which case they might wipe out the cultists entirely.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Many tribes of Black Blood cultists had arisen and fallen throughout the years. On occasion, clerics of Malar would seek to establish such a tribe in order to spread their god's influence.</p>
<p>As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , a number of notable tribes were active across Faerûn, largely as members of the Cults of the Moon. In the North, Uthgardt-affiliated nomadic tribes were active around the High Forest and Night Trees , and often raided caravans. In Chult, the Chultan tribes were very isolated, and so mostly focused on venerating lycanthropes (namely the nearby werebats of the People of the Black Blood) than attacking civilization. In Cormanthor, the main tribe was made up of elves , whose main concern had turned toward combatting the spread of drow into the region (although they also counted some drow among their own ranks). In the Underdark , a tribe of grimlock cultists came to revere the local werebats, and were known to hunt down nearby members of drow and duergar settlements.</p>
