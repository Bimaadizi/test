<p>Fachan , also known as Gruumsh-kin , were a malevolent sentient species.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The fachan was one of the most unusual-looking creatures on Toril . It had one leg and a single large foot with six toes. In the center of its face was a single large eye, and growing from the center of its chest was a single arm. Its face and skin resembled that of ogres and orcs . Their mouth was filled with sharp teeth, which were usually rotting and filthy.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Fachan were cruel creatures, often torturing their prey before eating them.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Fachan had powerful muscles that allowed them to jump up to 10 feet (3 meters) vertically and 8 feet (2.4 meters) horizontally. Fachan had an excellent sense of hearing.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>The primary battle tactic of a fachan was to ambush their target. They usually hid within the shallow water of their swamp, leaping out when their target was within range. Fachan could use most one-handed weapons but preferred axes , clubs , flails and swords . A fachan skull was unusually thick, and an impact could stun a target, even if the target was wearing armor. A bite from a fachan delivered a potent poison that paralyzed its victim. Once paralyzed, the fachan dragged the unfortunate victim underwater, holding them there until they drowned.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Fachan lived communally as tribes. A typical fachan village was composed of up to thirty individuals living in six large structures called lodges, which resembled large beaver lodges. Each lodge was up to 20 feet (6.1 meters) in diameter and were camouflaged.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Fachan were omnivores but their favorite meal was the meat from demihumans and humans .</p>
<h3>Habitat</h3>
<p>Fachan could be found living in marshes, swamps and wetlands south of the Orsraun Mountains . Fachan villages are known to be within the swamps of Durpar , Halruaa , and Turmish . The largest known fachan settlement was located within the Spider Swamp in Calimshan , although it was suspected even larger fachan settlements could be found within the swamps of Chult and Zakhara .</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>The feet of two fachan could be, if properly enchanted and treated, made into a pair of boots of striding and springing . The ear drum and canal of a fachan could be used as a material component in the brewing of a potion of clairaudience .</p>
