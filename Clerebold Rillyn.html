<p>Clerebold Rillyn was a member of the noble patriar Rillyn family of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Clerebold had an idea he passed along to his cousin, Derque Rillyn , to his usual praise. Clerebold suggested that Nortale's Hostel , a non-profit hostel used to help refugees during the Absolute crisis , should be renamed after Derque's daddy â€“ Hir Rillyn's Hostel, in order to convince him to donate a "good old chunk of change" in aid of the establishment and possibly even a bit of extra coin for Derque herself.</p>
