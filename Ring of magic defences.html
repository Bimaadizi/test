<p>Rings of magic defences were enchanted rings designed specially for use in wizards ' duels.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These simple-in-appearance rings were imbued with enchantments that improved the wearer's spellcrafting skills, increased their resistance to magic, and allowed them to cast dispel magic once per day.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These rings were especially popular in cities among spellcasters who often entered into magical duels. Even the weakest wizard could stave off powerful spells, albeit for only a short period of time. By the late 14 th century DR , these rings could be found in many huge settlements along the Sword Coast , including the city of Neverwinter .</p>
