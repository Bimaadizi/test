<p>Zhoukoudien , known as the High One, was a ruler of the batrachi civilization of Merrouroboros during the Days of Thunder ( −35,000 DR to −30,000 DR ).</p>
<p>The batrachi grew to the height of their power under Zhoukoudien's wise leadership. However, their golden age ended abruptly when the High One was killed in battle by Omo , a titan thane, around −31,500 DR . The batrachi lord Bazim-Gorag later called Zhoukoudien a fool who unwisely made war against the Jotunbrud and lost the empire.</p>
<p>The High One shared the same name as the batrachi realm of Zhoukoudien .</p>
