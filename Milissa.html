<p>Milissa was a peacewoman of Eldath who worked as a swimming instructor in the city of Ravens Bluff in the Vast in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR, she was a stunningly beautiful human priestess in her early twenties with blue eyes, slightly longer than shoulder-length blonde hair, and tan skin. Milissa was 5 feet and 8 inches (1.7 meters) tall and weighed 120 pounds (54 kilograms). She often wore flowing robes of green and blur.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Typically for people of her profession, Milissa did not enjoy conflict and never initiated battle and entered the fray only to defend her friends and loved ones. She greatly enjoyed paying to Eldath and preaching her dogma while at the seashore.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Milissa was fluent in Common and Elvish languages. She wielded clubs , staves , slings , and was highly proficient in swimming, healing, and weather sense. As a cleric, she could cast any divine spell from the charm school of magic and such spells as remove fear , sleep , and silence . Like other Eldathyn clergy, Milissa was a master of parrying and avoiding being attacked when in battle.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Milissa was a member of a wealthy family of landowners just outside of Ravens Bluff. Early in her life, she entered priestly training with the Church of Eldath . She showed talent, and long before she turned 22, Milissa became a fully-ordained cleric of Eldath, after which she joined an adventuring band as a traveling preacher of peace. The priestess quickly grew dissatisfied with adventuring life filled with battle and conflict, which disgusted her. She quit, returning back home.</p>
<p>Sometime later, when Milissa was 21, she encountered a young couple at one of her sermons. The youths asked the priestess to teach them to swim. Milissa agreed, and the number of students grew swiftly. She was later joined by her adventuring friend Morris as a fellow swimming instructor. Together they began running the swimming school part-time in Ravens Bluff's docks, hoping to save enough coin to build a Temple to Eldath in Ravens Bluff, not far from the harbors. Deena was one of Milissa's students who, eventually, joined her as a fellow teacher.</p>
<p>Milissa's teaching area could be found near a sign that read "Dive Right In" and "The Water is Just Fine." The priestess accepted creatures of any race to be taught basic swimming and more advanced techniques. Each lesson began with a short Eldathyn sermon of peace and serenity.</p>
