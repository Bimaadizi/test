<p>The Shadow Veil was a sizable and permanent planar rift in Thay that allowed for crossing between the Material Plane and the Shadowfell .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Veil appeared as a tall, shifting curtain that looked like a combination of a shadow and a heat mirage. Anything seem through the Veil appeared dim, flickering, and almost unreal.</p>
<p>The presence of the Veil both empowered and interfered with portals to and from the Shadowfell.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Shadow Veil cut through the town of Veil —where it provided access to and from the Shadowfell Road —and across the surrounding landscape. This region was often darkened by the shadow of the looming cliffs of the Thayan Plateau and the smoke of eruptions from the Thaymount .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the mid-to-late 15 th century DR , Thayans led by Valindra Shadowmantle made use of the Shadow Veil when mastering the Shadowfell Road in pursuit of their goals at the Dread Ring near Neverwinter. Thayan guards and fortifications were placed on both sides of the Veil to defend access to the Road.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the Netherese flying city of Kolthunral arrived in the area to besiege Surcross and Veil and to deny the Thayans access to the Shadowfell Road. The city remained close to the Veil in order to ensure that its portals functioned correctly, however the fluctuating planar energies of the Veil also interferes with the city's mighty meteor tubes —which worked by hurtling projectiles in and out of the Shadowfell—by causing their missiles to miss their targets. Thus, the areas beneath the Veil were protected from the Netherese bombardment that decimated the nearby Charnel Fields .</p>
<p>By that same time, a Thayan commander and Banite priest named Renault Abrecht believed that he had devised a means to collapse the Shadow Veil.</p>
