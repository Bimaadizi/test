<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Mouth of Moreyeus was one of many envoys from a city in Chessenta to Aglarond , who entered the palace in the 1262 DR under invitation by The Simbul . She judged them to be spies working for Thay , and thus struck at them with lightning the instant they crossed the threshold. There were few survivors, who were soon to witness Elminster Aumar 's battle with her.</p>
