<p>Pig's Eye , originally named Gruumshacan , was the elven enchanted short sword created to slaughter orcs .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Pig's Eye was a beautiful sword with a decorated blade and with an orcish glass eye embedded in its hilt. The sword's name and the glass eye were a reference to the legend of Corellon , the father of elves, and Gruumsh , and their famous battle in which the orcish god lost his eye to the First of the Seldarine .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Gruumshacan was a Moonblade of the House Caith. It possessed a +2 enchantment, which dramatically grew in strength when the sword was wielded against orcs. Upon a successful hit, Pig's Eye had a coin-toss of a chance of blinding its orc target.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gruumshacan was crafted in the Year of the Wandering Leucrotta, 239 DR by an elven enchanter named Shenarr Caith for his ranger cousin, Velaic Caith . The ranger wielded the Pig's Eye against vile orcs of Cormanthor who menaced the City of Song, Myth Drannor . The blade was passed along to the ranger's son Tredain Caith and grandson, Galesic Caith . The sword remained within the family for many centuries until House Caith decided to relocate to Evermeet . The family decided to sell Gruumshacan , the family's invaluable Moonblade , to finance their aged uncle Shenarr Caith 's transformation into a baelnorn . Shenarr found it amusing that Pig's Eye allowed him to avoid natural death.</p>
<p>By 1281 DR , Gruumshacan ended up in the hands of Conlan , the proprietor of Kuldahar 's blacksmith shop.</p>
