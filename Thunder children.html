<p>Thunder children , also known as storm children , night rattlers , or lightning-kin were a rare and strange species of sexless humanoid creatures associated with thunderstorms.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These humanoid creatures had shiny black bodies with gaunt frames, slender limbs, and vestigial wings. They had human -like faces with pointed ears, fangs, pupil-less eyes that flashed like lightning, and tiny horns on their temples.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>These creatures had a very capricious nature, very mischievous and malicious.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Thunder children possessed an innate magical ability that allowed them to cast the following spells seven times per day: chain lightning (which would be shot from their eyes) , fog cloud , gust of wind , and darkness, 15' radius .</p>
<p>Their bodies could only be harmed by weapons with a +1 or greater enchantment .</p>
<p>In addition, they were capable of expertly mimicking mundane sounds, such as heavy footfalls or squeaking doors. They could sense any fear within a 120 feet (37 meters) radius, were immune to feelings of fear and could assume a gaseous form that resembled a small, black storm cloud. They were skilled at hiding and moving silently within shadows.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Besides their use of spells and biting, thunder children would attack their victims in a psychological manner by doing things which would heighten unease regarding a storm. Such as loosening doors and windows, banging shutters, or throwing around small outdoor objects.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Thunder children were primarily active during the night or during violent thunderstorms. When acting in groups they had no proper leaders.</p>
<p>These creatures reproduced by flying into thunder clouds and getting struck by lightning. If they manage to survive the lightning strike, a half-strength thunder child would be born just as the thunderclap is heard. This new thunder child then matured over the course of six months.</p>
<h3>Homelands</h3>
<p>Thunder children were known to be found in places that were especially gloomy, such as decrepit mansions, old graveyards, and dark castles along a cliffside. Any place that inspired fear in humans, demihumans , and humanoids was ideal for them. They dwelled within little caves that they hollowed out from storm clouds.</p>
<p>Beyond the Prime Material plane , they could occasionally be found in the realm of Ravenloft , whose shadowy gothic atmosphere felt almost like a paradise to them. They could also be found in a relatively isolated part of the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Lightning , where they lived in autonomous tribes.</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>These creatures spoke Common in addition to their own language, which consisted of booms, crackles, and howls.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Due to their personalities thunder children were the enemies of many creatures in the Realms. Including air elementals , djinn , pegasi , cloud giants , and storm giants . The latter two considered them to be a nuisance, similar to how humans regarded rats , and referred to them as "thunder bats".</p>
<p>Those on the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Lightning never interacted with the native lightning quasi-elementals and shockers .</p>
<p>Despite the enmity often felt towards them, some thunder children were known to act as companions or servants of noble djinni .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Some rumors claimed that the blood of these creatures could be used in the brewing of a potion of gaseous form and potion of weather control .</p>
