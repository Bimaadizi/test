<p>After being killed by the Shadowking, it returned more powerful than before in undeath , when one of its offspring, Jacinica , bound it to the Marlspire of Najara . Terpenzi continued to serve the kings who ruled after it, fighting the relic but still caring about Najara. It resided in the Snake Pit of Ss'khanaja among the treasures of the kingdom.</p>
