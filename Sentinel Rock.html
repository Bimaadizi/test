<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The shrine was situated within a cavern set inside a steep cliff, also named Sentinel Rock, that stood just west of the King's Forest . It was accessible by crawling through of a small passageway whose opening was located about halfway up Sentinel Rock's cliffside.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
