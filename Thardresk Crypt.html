<p>Thardresk Crypt , also known as the Dungeon of Swords , was the supposed family tomb of the royal House Thardresk , ruling family of the ancient kingdom of Anauria . It was said to be the final resting place of the great King Thausimbel , as well as his daughter Queen Shaddara .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The crypt was one of many of its kind dating back to Anauria, set within the center of the Serpent Hills , in the Western Heartlands .</p>
<p>It served as a portal nexus that opened a network of portals between a number of Anaurian tombs, including another false Thardresk family crypt beneath a ruined temple of Jergal in the eastern deserts of Anauroch , and an empty tomb beneath the Evermoors .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Circa the late 14 th century DR , the crypt was only accessible by means of a tunnel that connected to the carved-out pathways of a mining expedition. All other openings had been sealed away by an earthquake some time ago.</p>
<p>It was as heavily guarded as the other tombs in the area, with magical traps and tricks, along with undead , ready to attack adventurers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gate, 1341 DR , gnomes of Clan Argentum began digging into the center of the Serpent Hills in search for silver and broke through into the crypts. A few of the braver gnome warriors ventured within but were forced to flee and abandon their dig site in short order.</p>
<p>Starting in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , agents of the Cult of the Dragon and members of House Orogoth both sought out the crypts for their own ends.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>At least one adult deep dragon was known to dwell within the deepest depths of the crypt before being slain by dragon cultists circa 1371 DR , though its mate survived to drive them out.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Throughout the history of its existence, rumors held that it was actually a false crypt, disguising the existence of a number of tombs for the royalty of Anauria that were linked together by its portal nexus . This was confirmed by the dragon cultists that made their foray into its depths during the midâ€“14 th century DR.</p>
