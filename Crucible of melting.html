<p>A crucible of melting was an enchanted device that melted metals.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When metal was placed inside and a command word spoken, the crucible heated to sufficient temperature to melt the metal inside within ten minutes. Half of those crucibles remained hot for half an hour, while the other half would remain hot until turned off. The crucible had no effect on anything other than metals.</p>
<p>However, there was a small yet dangerous chance that the crucible might explode instead, peppering everyone within 10 feet (3 meters) with metal. Sometimes, the crucible survived the explosion and could be reused.</p>
<p>Such crucibles did not operate underwater.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>One such crucible was in use at the Chantry of St. Sammaster in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR .</p>
