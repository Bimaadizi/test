<p>Clockwork toys , sometimes known simply as clockworks , were small delicate mechanical figures created for recreational means. They were typically created by members of the Church of Gond , though some of the industrious rock gnomes of Toril were also known to craft them, as were the tinker gnomes of Krynn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Clockwork toys were created in a variety of different forms. Many were crafted in the shape of animals, such as birds , fish , frogs , or mice . But others were crafted in the forms of humans or demihumans , dragons , soldiers, or various types of monsters, such as cockatrices .</p>
<p>They were made of metal, such as brass or gold . And their delicate shells were crammed full of springs , wires , and other clockwork that enabled them to walk, fly, or swim for short distances. Some even emitted imitations of the sounds of creatures they were crafted to resemble.</p>
<p>Some clockwork toys took on more esoteric forms. One such example from the late 15 th century DR was that of egg -shaped jewelry boxes, which had several layers that rotated within each other, and played tunes like a music box . Through their revolutions these layers would reveal elaborated etched or painted scenes. Commonly depicted scenes included such things as royal feasts, men dueling with swords , or skeletons within a dungeon escaping from the confines of their shackles .</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to the Spellplague era, the Lantan's supply and sale of such contraptions on mainland Faer√ªn was more limited in scope.</p>
<p>For a time it was considered quite fashionable among Cormyrean nobles to gift King Azoun Obarskyr IV one of the intricate clockwork toys crafted by the Gaewilder brothers of Ravens Bluff, until Azoun himself grew tiresome of the fad and would sigh loudly whenever he was presented with another.</p>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR, after a consortium of Lantanese gnome -ran merchant organizations established the Lantan-Samarach portal , the gnomes provided the local Samarachans new methods of illusory defenses and the wonders of Lantanese clockwork toys.</p>
