<p>Faline Abbot was a knight of the Purple Dragons of Cormyr , who was stationed at Wheloon Prison in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Faline was a human woman with light skin, ashy brown hair, and bright blue eyes. She wore her shoulder-length hair loose with some braids.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid-1480s DR, Faline was posted at the docks of Wheloon Prison as part of the guard detail. When the Shadovar invasion of Wheloon began, the Cormyreans were kept unaware, though Faline Abbot noticed the unusual gang activity among the inmates. She was approached by the Amaunatori Dai Rolno , who impressed upon her the innocence of those trapped inside. When it reached her that the Wheloon Natives were being attacked by other gangs, she sent a group of hirelings into the prison to check on them and keep them safe, meeting Seth Wentalle at Harvest Hall . They then went into the Wheloon drainage culverts and fought off the gang led by Porto , Athea , and Aramiya Troise , who had sought to destroy the natives. With evidence of what was going on inside the prison, Faline was even more convinced that the situation was untenable and unjust, even if her superior Constal Davny Selkin didn't quite believe it.</p>
