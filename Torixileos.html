<p>Torixileos was a white dragon apparently living with its treasure inside a glacier near Silverymoon Pass .</p>
<p>The dragon abducted Lynaelle Dawnmantle as Lynaelle traversed the pass during a blizzard. Taken back to the dragon's lair, Lynaelle was frightened into assisting Torixileos in plundering a young silver dragon named Starglimmer 's hoard. Lynaelle discovered the deception in time to rescue Starglimmer and herself as a larger silver dragon arrived. The larger silver, Symarra Brightmoon , killed Torixileos, thereby rescuing both her son and Lynaella.</p>
