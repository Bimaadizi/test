<p>"The Prophet" was a painting found in Neverwinter on the Sword Coast North in the late 15 th century DR . It was considered "newer" by 1479 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was a portrait of a female elf garbed in black with a purple sash , with a mechanical owl perched on her arm. The title "The Prophet" was etched into the frame. The subject did not appear particularly prescient.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>"The Prophet" was found in the Merchant Guild Hall in the Neverwinter/River District of Neverwinter in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , presumably having been left behind by the guild merchants or looted by the Many-Arrows orcs who occupied the district and turned the hall into a fortress. Although the orcs burned, smashed, or defiled all the artworks within, "The Prophet" survived curiously intact and left propped against some crates.</p>
