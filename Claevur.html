<p>Claevur was a food item available in Khôltar , south Faerûn , circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Claevur was a fish casserole made from whatever salted fish was available off of caravans that stopped in Khôltar, the Iron City. The fish was de-boned and spiced , then mixed with grubs, greens, and tubers and baked. It was served in a hardrusk bun (a flat-bottomed bread bowl with a large cavity, baked until the crust was very hard) for 2 silver pieces at Munsrum's Ready Ladle on the North Way near Handrornlar, the northern gate out of Khôltar. This dish was Munsrum's version of what many locals fixed at home.</p>
