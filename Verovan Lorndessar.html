<p>Verovan Lorndessar was the last king of the city of Westgate .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was the great grandson of King Blaervaer Lorndessar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Verovan ruled from the Year of the Struck Gong, 1236 DR , until the Year of the Cockatrice, 1248 DR .</p>
<p>Verovan perished during a boat race on the Sea of Fallen Stars , shipwrecking at the Neck . at the hands of the Red Wizards of Thay . He was hated by much of the population of Westgate and considered to be a tyrant. His coffers were plundered within three days of his death. A statue depicting Verovan Lorndessar that stood in Westgate's Harbor Loop was beheaded but left standing as a reminder of the city's attitude towards kings. A book was penned sometime before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , King Verovan's Treasure , that collected stories and legends of rumored dead king's treasures hidden somewhere in Westgate.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>It was a belief among some that Verovan Lorndessar sold a part of his soul to some unknown demon lord in exchange for a pocket plane somewhere in the Abyss . The King turned it into his fabled treasure vault, accessible only through a secret mechanism known only to Verovan. The knowledge of the vault might've been lost forever with the King's death.</p>
