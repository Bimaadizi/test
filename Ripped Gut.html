<p>The Ripped Gut tribe was a group of orcs that lived in the network of caves called Baraskur , which was located in the northern slopes of the Nether Mountains .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Periodically, the Ripped Gut orcs would find a host body, a live woman of a certain appearance, to placate the restless spirit, Aumathra , who watched over them. When she was in possession of one of these supplications, Aumathra would order the Ripped Gut orcs as her minions, on a spree of ransacking local ruins.</p>
<h2>Leadership</h2>
<p>The tribe was led by "Old Gut" Arlagh Deathclaw , who in turn was served by a council of elders. Among the important figures of the tribe were the chieftain's son, Ragrath , and the older cleric of Gruumsh , Orauth Skullstone .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some centuries before the Time of Troubles , Aumathra lived with the Ripped Gut orcs as a young woman. She was a sorceress who had been exiled by her own people.</p>
