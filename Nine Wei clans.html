<p>The Nine Wei clans were a collection of nine Shou clans who effectively controlled all of Shou political life on the Dragon Coast as of the late 15 th century DR . "Wei" roughly translated to "power".</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Nine Wei included the clans who ruled over the Shou nation of Nathlan , but they also projected their power over the various Shou-towns throughout the Dragon Coast. Through their sponsorship of the Nine Golden Swords , they wielded further influence within the city of Westgate .</p>
<p>Individual members of the Nine Wei clans jockeyed against each other for power and influence in the Dragon Coast, and to curry favor with the Neng clan , the clan that led the Nine. The Neng clan was a "consort" clan of Shou Lung , and thus had strong ties to the Shou imperial court. Their leadership was said to be divine , and the clan set a highly lawful and traditionalist tone for the Nine Wei clans.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Wei clans rose to power in the 15 th century DR, although the roots of their influence stretched back centuries to the original arrival of the Neng clan in Nathlekh .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , a supposed heir to one of the Nine Wei clans conspired to destroy the Fan clan , another prominent Wei member. Under the pseudonym Madfox , he established a criminal syndicate known as the White Petal Tong in order to frustrate efforts to form a trade alliance between the Fan and the Neng clans. Mad Fox was ultimately revealed to be a member of the Tsui clan , a minor family from Nathlekh with aspirations of being counted among the Wei.</p>
