<p>Halaster's drifting portals were magical portals spread throughout the dungeon of Undermountain beneath Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>As their name implied, these portals moved about of their own volition. The origin and terminus of each portal was tied to a general area, but not to a specific location as with other portals . The radius where each portal traveled was set when it was created and extended up to 1,000 feet (300 meters). The portals moved randomly to include up into the air, but their movement could be controlled if the creator of the portal concentrated.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These portals were originally created by the Mad Mage Halaster Blackcloak .</p>
