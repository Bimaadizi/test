<p>Berun's Hill was a bare-topped, conical hill that commanded a splendid view of the valley of the Dessarin River to the east.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The hill was used as a lookout for advancing barbarians and orc hordes from north and east. The hill got its name from the ranger Berun . He was slain by an orc horde but managed to take 300 tuskers with him, before they overwhelmed him. Bandits sometimes watched for likely victims from this hill.</p>
<p>In 1351 DR , a group of fifty dwarven priests of Marthammor Duin discovered the dwarven tomb that had long been talked about in legends of the North . They found that this cavernous crypt belonged to none other than Maegar, of the Royal House of the Helm of Gharraghaur , and that it had been plundered long ago by duergar .</p>
<h2>Rumors and Legends</h2>
<p>Legend tells that under the hill lay the grave of an ancient dwarf with rich golden armor and treasures, but none ever found it.</p>
