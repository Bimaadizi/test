<p>Hmur's Way was the sole major clear roadway in the underwater city of Myth Nantar .</p>
<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>Hmur's Way was most likely named for Hmur , a mythical figure among the merfolk of Serôs that was said to have been the first of them created by Eadro and the namesake of the Hmur Plateau .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This road was paved in blaze coral and depicted mosaics that over time broke down in appearance. Like the other major roadways of Myth Nantar, it measured 30 feet (9.1 meters) in width. It spanned west from the lowest slope of Mount Halaath to the Fire Fountain at the city's central square.</p>
