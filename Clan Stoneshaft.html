<p>Clan Stoneshaft was a family of shield dwarves that hailed from the Sword Coast region of the North .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Like most dwarven families, Clan Stoneshaft was led by a single family head. As of the midâˆ’14 th century the head of the clan was Ebenezer Stoneshaft .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Dwarves of Clan Stoneshaft were found to often enjoy the abundant and varied culture that could be found in the grand metropolis of Waterdeep , including its fashions and styles of music found within. They were known as skilled metalsmiths and gem -workers, particularly for their craftsmanship of jewelry and other decorations that were worn on the body.</p>
<p>Due to years spent in isolation the clan as a whole were rather withdrawn and unforthcoming.</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>Warriors of Clan Stoneshaft preferred to wear plate mail armor and wield bludgeoning weapons in battle.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>Originally the dwarves of Clan Stoneshaft dwelled within an underground clanhold, located beneath the southern border of the Mere of Dead Men .</p>
<p>Throughout the latter of the 14 th and all of the 15 th centuries DR , the Stoneshaft dwarves resided within Stoneshaft Hold , a fortress that was gifted to them by one of their greatest allies.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Stoneshaft dwarves were weary of Waterdhavian politics, especially any related to the noble Margaster family.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , agents of the Zhentarim traveled through a stretch of the Underdark in order to seize the keep of Thornhold by means of its subterranean tunnels. They marched through the Stoneshaft clanhold and routed their kin, killing many and enslaving many others.</p>
<p>Ebenezer Stoneshaft rallied his fellow clansmen that managed to survive and allied with a member of the Harpers named Bronwyn Caradoon . Together they managed to defeat the Zhentarim at Thornhold, and reclaim the keep that once belonged to Bronwyn's ancestor, Samular Caradoon . As an act of friendship, Bronwyn bequeathed her family's keep to Clan Stoneshaft under its new name, Stoneshaft Hold.</p>
<p>The dwarves' new home proved quite profitable for well over a decade, as it was a crucial waystop for merchants and travelers venturing north along the High Road around the Mere of Dead Men. Unfortunately the boon of commercial wealth stopped in the years following the Spellplague , in the Year of Three Streams Blooded, 1384 DR , as geological changes cause the Mere to expand southward and cut off overland travel to Stoneshaft Hold.</p>
<p>Clan Stoneshaft languished in isolation in the decades that followed. During these years they hoarded their resources and honed their skill as craftspeople. They were finally able to open up Stoneshaft Hold to travelers again after the world-changing events of the Second Sundering .</p>
