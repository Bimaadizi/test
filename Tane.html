<p>Tane was a tumbler and performer that traveled across the Realms with a traveling troupe in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Along with their siblings, Tane was an odd individual. When the group was together and approached by a stranger they only responded in terse grunts and vague nods, unless the interrupting person was especially entertaining.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Tane was one of three triplets, along with Tawn and Tine .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>One of the three tumblers owned a bag of magic dust that could be thrown hard to the ground to conjure a great cloud. This was regularly used in the act that they performed together.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time during the 1480s DR, Tane and their traveling companions stopped at the city of Phlan on the Moonsea North to perform their act for a while. At some point, they stopped at Madame Freona's Tea Kettle .</p>
