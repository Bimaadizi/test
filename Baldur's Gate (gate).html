<p>Baldur's Gate was the eponymous city gate that gave the famed port city of the Sword Coast its name. It was one of the oldest Baldurian landmarks, located in the heart of the city, that separated the aristocratic Upper City from the working-class Lower City . In fact, by the 15 th century DR , it had become a symbol that embodied the class struggle between the city's rich and poorer citizens.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The gate was inset within the city's old wall. Heading south through the gate led to The Steeps in the Lower City, while the street north from the gate separated the Temples District from The Wide .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Despite its name, Baldur's Gate was the most ordinary of the city's numerous walled passageways. The cobbles beneath its archway had been worn flat by all the steps that had been taken across them over the course of many years.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to the city's Tax Revolts , Baldur's Gate was the only means to reach the city from Gray Harbor . The uproarious event was actually caused by city officials enacting taxation of goods that passed through this landmark.</p>
<p>Ironically, after the revolts were settled, the newly formed Council of Four put in place very similar tolls on the gate that benefited the city's government. These taxes continued for centuries and, as of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , cost 5 cp to each individual.</p>
