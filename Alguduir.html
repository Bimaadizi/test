<p>Alguduirs , also known as "swamp dragons" , were a semi-aquatic avian humanoid.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Alguduirs were large avian-like humanoids. Their body was covered in thick scales which were covered in secreted oils. They had a pair of large wings which were mottled in various colors. A set of gills were located along their neck, under their beak.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Alguduirs were skilled swimmers and could breathe underwater. The feathers on their wings were coated with oil. This oil allowed an alguduir to take flight once it emerged from water. Alguduirs has the natural ability to reflect spells cast at them back to the caster. This ability was involuntary, an alguduir was not able to selectively reflect spells.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Alguduirs were very territorial and did not tolerate the presence of trespassers in their territory or near their lair.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Alguduirs had very straightforward tactics for combat. If facing an aquatic foe, they grasped it with their talons and raised their opponent into the air, suffocating them. If facing a terrestrial opponent, they dragged it down into the water, holding onto their target until it drowned. Despite their four sharp talons on each foot, algudirs only used them to grasp onto a target, not as a weapon.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Alguduirs were carnivores that fed on the fauna commonly found in marshes, including giant varieties. These included such things as fish , frogs , snakes , and mussels that they would bash open upon the rocks. Alguduir would occasionally consume sentient beings.</p>
<h3>Homelands</h3>
<p>Alguduirs lived only in large marshes and swamps. They made their lairs on small patches of land deep within their swamp.</p>
<p>In Northwest Faerûn , some were known to dwell within the Mere of Dead Men .</p>
