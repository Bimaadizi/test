<p>The Narwhal was a stolen galleon from the Cormyrean armada and later repurposed for both piracy and as the centerpiece of the Refuge Bay Trading Company fleet. At some point after 1362 DR , it ended up upside down in the middle of the Chultan jungle due to a dysfunction in magic .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally, the ship belonged to Cormyr's navy. Sometime before 1362 DR, Captain Bawr assembled a fleet of pirate ships on the Sea of Fallen Stars and took the galleon by force. The pirate later cut a deal with the masters of Zhentil Keep , who provided a group of very muscular giants to take on the task of moving the Narwhal across Faerûn , all the way from the Inner Sea to the Sword Coast .</p>
<p>The ship was used for both piracy and high-paying cargo transports for the Refuge Bay Trading Company. Its primary goods included near-priceless teak and ivory from Chult.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Helm, 1362 DR , Artus Cimber and Hydel Pontifax sailed from Baldur's Gate to Chult aboard the Narwhal , seeking the legendary Ring of Winter . Unknowingly to them, their adversary Kaverin Ebonhand boarded the ship with them, in order to steal information and, eventually, find the ring before them. As the journey neared its conclusion near the shores of Refuge Bay , the ship encountered Aremag , a dragon turtle , who unlawfully demanded a tribute despite its prior agreement with Bawr and the Refuge Bay Trading Company. While enraged by this breach, Bawr offered Artus Cimber as a payment to Aremag. However, Artus was protected by an enchanted Mulhorandi medallion housing a powerful guardian phantom named Skuld . When Bawr, transformed into a monstrous reptile-looking creature, attacked Artus, Skuld intervened, overpowering the captain. In the ensuing struggle, Bawr was thrown overboard and consumed by Aremag.</p>
<p>Shortly after Captain Bawr's demise, Nelock , a former officer of the Narwhal , arise as the new captain.</p>
<p>In the late 1490s DR , the wreckage of the Narwhal could be found in the middle of the Chultan jungle, approximately 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the nearest coast, where it landed after getting placed there by a magical mishap. A weretiger named Bwayes O'tamu , cousin of the merchant prince Wakanga O'tamu , was using what was left of the galleon as a hideout. He lived in the now upside-down captain's room, which was properly furnished. A group of vegepygmies co-existed with the weretiger on the ship, feeding on what food he gave to them.</p>
