<p>Thylius was the son of Julios Caramitru and Korona Caramitru , two minor nobles working in the city's bureaucracy.</p>
<p>In around 1491 DR , after a trip to the Monastery of the Yellow Rose , he said he had learned the new meditation technique of the Yellow Breath . Thylius soon had his first disciple in the young Riasa Yegorovna . They gave a demonstration during a party hosted by Astrid Saj and Rosealine Culkin to honor Aleyd Burral , the Resurrected Hero of Phlan . In truth, Thylius had kidnapped a monk, Ovon , whom he had befriended at the monastery and had forced him to teach him the secret of Yellow Breath. Thylius wanted to use this lore to create a cult devoted to himself among young noble scions and rise in power in the city. He gathered some young nobles at the Yellow Breath Chapter House . However, an adventuring party hired to find the missing young nobles at last confronted and defeated him.</p>
