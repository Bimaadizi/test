<p>Muthtur was a half-orc outcast and gladiator at the Arena beneath Llorkh .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The half-orc wore brown chain mail , as well as scum-green clothing. He fought with a longsword that had a purple guard and pommel, as well as a shield . Muthtur's looks certainly favored his orc heritage, having a snout and two large tusks.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He believed most people scorned his appearance, and did not hesitate from saying it. Despite this demeanor, all he really wanted was to be at peace in his home.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Muthtur lived with a group of other outcasts in the High Forest . One day, he was seized from the forest he called home, and taken to the Arena beneath Llorkh. On his way in, the half-orc spotted a secret door to the northern alcove of the arena. He was to entertain the crowd at the arena as a "novelty fighter", as there were mostly only humans or monsters fighting.</p>
<p>Circa 1358 DR , the half-orc hatched a plan to escape the arena. When a new party, who would become the Heroes of Ascore , had finished their first fight in the arena, he distracted the guards, and the adventurers grabbed the keys. He told his story, and also the whereabouts of the secret exit.</p>
