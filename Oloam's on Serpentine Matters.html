<p>Oloam's on Serpentine Matters was an academic magic textbook written by the Netherese arcanist Oloam .</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>The book was a study of transformative spells that conferred reptilian forms upon human spellcasters, as well as specific features such as scales and nictating membranes. It contained a wealth of information on the effects of these spells, how to modify them, drawbacks and dangers associated with them, and the results of Oloam's own personal experiments in improving them.</p>
<p>Much of Oloam's work was focused on ensuring that the transformations did not affect human speech and hands for somatic and verbal components . A secondary goal was the general empowerment of these transformations, such as increased crushing strength, improved control of prehensible tails, and deadlier venom that could be delivered by skin contact.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Oloam's on Serpentine Matters was considered a foundational piece of work by the arcanists of Netheril during the Age of Discovery ( 2654 NY (−1205 DR) onwards). Any respectable arcane library would be expected to contain a copy of it, along with other classics such as Sarturl's Study of Magical Fields , Ivrynxra's Exploration of Enchantments , Skouloond's Spell Studies , and Haerro's Veltanabula .</p>
