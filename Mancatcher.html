<p>A mancatcher or catch-pole was a type of weapon used for capturing animals, monsters, or people.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was a specialized polearm some 8 feet (2.4 meters) long and weighing 8 pounds (3.6 kilograms) with two curving prongs mounted on one end. These were sized to enclose a humanoid such as a human down to the size of a halfling ; creatures more than 50% bigger or smaller than the weapon was designed for could not be caught. In addition, these prongs had spikes and sharp inner edges to harm a trapped creature, prevent them using their arms, or limit their attempts to resist or escape.</p>
<p>Some mancatchers had spring-loaded prongs that snapped shut or hinged prongs that could be opened or closed with the pull of a cord. Others were simple nooses on the ends of long poles that could be thrown over the neck and drawn tight.</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>On striking an opponent, the wielder of a mancatcher could easily try to grab them between the prongs and keep them safely at a distance. Being caught in a mancatcher left a victim near-defenseless and easily pushed or pulled around or forced to kneel or lie prone. One would have to bend the bars to escape, but this was hazardous with the spikes and sharp edges. To rescue a trapped creature, allies typically had to chop through the haft or defeat the wielder first. The standard tactic for the mancatcher was to first trap an opponent and then pull them off their feet or off their mount, and then pin them to ground, where they were almost helpless. The wielder could release the trapped opponent with a little effort.</p>
