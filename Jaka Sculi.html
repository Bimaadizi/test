<p>Jaka Sculi was a rash young man in the town of Auckney , nestled along the Cold Run .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Jaka was rather self-centered and felt he was better than everyone else, even thinking of himself as "honest" in comparison to nobles he thought of as callous and uncaring towards his lot. He "fell in love" with Meralda Ganderlay only after learning of Lord Feringal Auck 's interest in her, and fancied himself a womanizer, yet he didn't like the concept of marriage. He spent a lot of time away from the town cursing his lot and life, particularly when it came to his "love."</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early life</h3>
<p>When Jaka was toddler, his family was forced leave the Blade Kingdoms for unknown reasons and settled in Luskan. While Jaka enjoyed life in Luskan , Jaka was forced to move again to Auckney with his mother and uncle Rampini in 1365 DR . He would speculate that it was to escape his abusive father or that his uncle killed his father. He and his mother were distant descendants of the mercenary princes of the Blade Kingdoms .</p>
<h3>Pursuing Meralda</h3>
<p>Around 1369 DR , Jaka became attracted to Meralda Ganderlay . However, the same day, he learned from his family that Lord Feringal Auck 's steward, Temigast , had invited Meralda to Castle Auck for dinner. Quickly becoming upset upon hearing that Feringal would likely use and discard her, he stormed away from the dinner table to the spot overlooking the Ganderlay farm to fume over the perceived injustice thrust upon himself. When he was later found by Meralda's sister, Tori, who briefly teased that he was hoping to see Meralda in a state of undress, he privately vowed to the gods that he would take her virginity, for the sole reason that the Lord, who's eyes she had caught, wouldn't get it.</p>
<p>He would frequently accost Meralda when she was being escorted back from Castle Auck while ranting miserably to himself. On the first attempt, he managed to steal a kiss, before being ruthlessly beaten by Meralda's father, Dohni, for his interference.</p>
<p>One night, Meralda snuck out of her house to meet with Jaka, who proceeded to seduce her and succeeded in taking her virginity. After a second round of lovemaking, knowing Meralda intended to marry Feringal out of duty to her family, he tried to encourage her to run away with him but was declined, hardening his resolve to win her over.</p>
<p>Later, Jaka continued to stalk her house, miserably watching Dohni befriend her driver, Liam Woodgate , leading him to believe that he had no allies. He would proceed to lay upon the hill in depression throughout the stormy night and into the morning, before being roused by his fellow field workers. After being berated by his foreman, Jaka's jealousy only grew upon seeing Meralda's family accompany her to Castle Auck.</p>
<p>Three weeks later, Meralda approached him at his house to reveal she was pregnant, to his surprise. Fearing what Feringal would do if he found out, she proposed they run away together, but Jaka found the idea of living in poverty and of her figure growing fat and ugly from motherhood intolerable, causing her to realize he never truly loved her, and ran off.</p>
<p>Desperate, Jaka later approached Meralda during another of her escorts home to plead his "love" but made the mistake of saying that he didn't want Feringal to raise their child as his own. But this only convinced Meralda that he wasn't truly capable of love or of giving herself and her child a good life and fully rejected him. Jaka would later crash their wedding to beg Meralda to elope with him, threatening to jump to his death. As Feringal sent his guards after him, Jaka accidentally fell off the sea cliffs, incidentally causing the wedding to be postponed for three days.</p>
<h3>Legacy</h3>
<p>Meralda would later come to terms with her feelings for Jaka, knowing he had a small place in her heart, yet carried no guilt for his demise. However, she would be constantly thinking of him in the subsequent months, wondering if Jaka had truly fallen in love with her in his last moments.</p>
<p>Jaka's child was later born seven months into Meralda's marriage with Feringal, with both Temigast and Priscilla Auck both suspecting him to be the father, rather than Wulfgar , whom Meralda falsely accused of rape to cover her pregnancy, while rumors circulated in Auckney given Jaka's tragic and public demise. To save Meralda from either banishment or execution, Wulfgar stormed Castle Auck and formally claimed the child, later named Colson , as his own.</p>
