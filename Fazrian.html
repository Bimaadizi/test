<p>Fazrian was an evil planetar who ruled the Terminus Level of Undermountain .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Fazrian originally served Torm , until being called down by a cleric in Undermountain.</p>
<p>Arriving there, Fazrian was disgusted by the corruption and sought to cleanse it. Fazrian failed to realize it was slowly becoming more bloodthirsty and eventually slaughtered the cleric who had summoned it, along with her companions.</p>
<p>Fazrian then proceeded to take control of the Terminus Level. Halaster Blackcloak sent Fazrian a host of four yugoloths to command, in exchange for payment. The four included the arcanaloths Aximus and Exekarus , the ultroloth Xindulus , and the nycaloth Raxxus .</p>
