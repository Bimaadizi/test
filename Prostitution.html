<p>Prostitution was a widely practiced industry across the Realms that involved people engaging in sexual services or performances in exchange for payment. Though some might seek the service out to slake lustful desires, others did so simply for companionship, looking to dispel their loneliness with a moment of intimacy. A person who worked in this field was commonly called either a prostitute , escort , coin lass (if female), coin lad (if male), or turncoin (also if male). However, there existed a much wider array of euphemistic and colloquial terms, some of which were used pejoratively. A prostitute could be of any race, sex, or gender .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<h3>Procurement Methods</h3>
<p>Prostitution could take place in a variety of forms. The first most common was street prostitution, wherein prostitutes waited on streets and alleys to attract and solicit clientele. In the rural, cold-climate reaches of the Realms, it was not uncommon for prostitutes to accentuate themselves to strangers by exposing their breasts and holding up a lantern to spotlight them. Once a prospective client was secured, they would then take them away to be entertained elsewhere, most commonly in either a rented room or down in a cellar off of the alleyway in which they made the transaction.</p>
<p>The rented rooms were frequently located above where an escort was doing business, atop some street-level shop that had no connection to them. Other times a prostitute and their client might take their tryst to a business known for its privacy and discretion, such as the bathhouses Hissing Stones and Black Sapphire Bath , or might rent out booths at a taphouse like The Lunge , or go to secluded public spaces like certain courtyards, a building's back stair , or even cemeteries, such as the City of the Dead .</p>
<p>The second most common form was that of a dedicated establishment run by an organizer, wherein prostitutes were given room and board in return for a cut of their earnings, and were usually open well into the small bells before dawn . Such establishments were referred to variously as brothels , bawdy houses , bordellos , cathouses , house of ill repute , houses of pleasure , joy-houses , pleasure houses , palaces of pleasure , pleasure palaces , and whorehouses . Such establishments were categorized as 'entertainment houses' and 'red-light businesses'.</p>
<p>In thieves' cant , brothels were sometimes referred to as 'academies'. This was due in part to some informal houses of pleasure masquerading themselves as schools for young nobles, a tactic that usually lasted until some public scandal revealed the truth. This didn't necessarily mean no actual schooling was going on in such establishments— Tartel's House of the Sword , a finishing school in Waterdeep, offered lessons in fencing and sword training in addition to its clandestine prostitution services. Similarly, some brothels masqueraded as simple rooming houses with discreet 'room service' from their 'house girls'; there were one or two of these in Crimmor , Amn , while Tabra's in Bargewright Inn was both festhall and rooming house.</p>
<p>Additionally, sometimes brothels or prostitution businesses were run more informally by the upper-floor tenants of a tallhouse or even by rural lasses converting an old farmhouse into a house of pleasure.</p>
<p>The more elaborate forms of in-house prostitution establishments were known as festhalls . These businesses were quite varied in their execution, combining aspects of many other entertainment venues into one, such as a tavern, a casino, a theater, a bathhouse , or a private club. Many offered specialized services such as crossdressing, gambling (of one's body or articles of clothing), mate-swapping , S&M , play-acting, striptease performances, interspecies congress, or other situations that visitors wouldn't dare to try outside of a club.</p>
<p>The third form that prostitution took was that of escort services . These businesses, such as the Hanging Lantern , worked by having clients make appointments with their roster of escorts to meet them at their house or some boarding room they were staying at. In some cases these expanded to be general hireling agencies, such as Elstearn's Escorts in Menzoberranzan.</p>
<h3>Economics</h3>
<p>The cost of dalliance with prostitutes could vary wildly based on a variety of different factors, such as their beauty, fame, or mere whims. Beauty in particular was an important factor in the profession. In Waterdeep for example, the escorts at the Gentle Mermaid charged 60 gold pieces per hour of their time and anywhere to ten times that amount for an entire evening, with 20% of their earnings being taken by the proprietor, whereas the escorts at The Jade Dancer charged 6 to 12 gp per half an hour.</p>
<p>Some entered into the profession under the notion that it was a good way to get "quick coin".</p>
<p>In the Dalelands , Turmish , and to a lesser extent other places in the Realms, lifeblood was looked upon negatively by prostitutes as "lost days of earning", as a number of men found that monthly stage to be unsavory. In such areas, "the Change" ( i.e. , menopause) was welcomed by escorts.</p>
<h3>Crime & Law</h3>
<p>The legal status of prostitution varied from nation to nation. For example it was considered legal in Waterdeep, Zazesspur , and the kingdom of Cormyr (despite King Azoun IV 's rumored distaste for the profession). Meanwhile, it was illegal in the village of Nagarr and for a time in the city of Ravens Bluff .</p>
<p>With legality came regulations on the industry. In Waterdeep, for instance, it was illegal to employ shapechangers without informing clients and to employ prostitutes through duress or slavery . Additionally, many places where the industry was legal had strict "zoning laws" regarding brothels and festhalls. And no matter the place in the Realms, even those where prostitution was permissible, it was of course highly illegal for one to traffic in the pimping of youths.</p>
<p>The industry's legality was called into question as, though for many it was a voluntary practice, prostitution could be exploitative or coercive. There were times and places in Faerûn and Kara-Tur where people were forced into becoming prostitutes through kidnapping, slavery, and trafficking or threats of violence towards them, their property, or their family and loved ones.</p>
<p>Because of regulations or outright illegality, the prostitution industry often fell under the grasp of criminal organizations. This included many thieves' guilds , the Brothers Six , black marketeers in Calimshan , the pirate lord Desharik , who forced many of Brynnlaw 's inhabitants into enslaved courtesanship at Lady Galvena's Festhall , the crime lord Elaith Craulnober , the Iron Throne , the Shadowmasters of Telflamm , and some of the autonomous cells of the Cult of the Dragon in the 1370s DR .</p>
<p>This factor made harlots frequent contacts of rogues . Their connections with criminal groups were common enough that it was lampooned in the 15 th century DR by a comedic play, Sapphiria's Booty , which centered on a madam that ran a thieves' guild out of her own festhall.</p>
<p>In some cases criminal organizations used festhalls as fronts for their illicit operations. For example, the Kraken Society operated out of the Three Rivers Festhall and the shapechanger society the Unseen was for a time based in the Hanging Lantern, starting in 1362 DR . There they illicitly employed doppelgangers as escorts. After the publication of Volo's Guide to Waterdeep revealed the true nature of their staff, the Unseen were forced to relocate their base of operations.</p>
<p>A more unusual form of criminal activity occurred in Ravens Bluff; it was not uncommon for inmates housed in the Knight's Ward and Lord's Ward of the Nevin Street Compter to have prostitutes smuggled in for them at night in exchange for a hefty bribe.</p>
<h3>Other Services</h3>
<p>Beyond the sexual services and performances that defined the prostitution industry, coin lasses and lads sometimes had more to offer their clients. Many viewed them as valuable sources of intel from the various clients they serviced, criminal or otherwise, as they were exposed to various bits of gossip and secrets. To this end, some festhalls sported escorts and dancers that were specially schooled in the art of conversation, becoming quite skilled at drawing information out from people. Similarly, geishas were often experts at manipulation and made for ideal spies. For these reasons, the Harpers had a fair few members that were courtesans, Shindia Darkeyes employed (or kept as contacts) many courtesans and festhall girls in Waterdeep as information gatherers, and the Zhentarim had escorts at the Tesh Inn in Zhentil Keep that reported all intel back to them. In 1479 DR , Storm Silverhand even made an effort to revitalize the Harpers of Cormyr by seeking out people from all walks of life, including the escorts of brothels. Otherwise, prostitutes were willing to provide anyone information for the right amount of tenday stipend.</p>
<p>The pirate-frequented inn known as the Cutlass notably had lady escorts on staff that were skilled thieves and fighters . In addition to sexual services, they were expected to aid guests in making an escape if the authorities ever came in after them, whether it be by making a distraction or outright fighting to clear a way for them.</p>
<p>In cities where the scent-making market wasn't tightly controlled by guilds , most festhalls and even some street escorts would try to sell their clients perfume .</p>
<h3>Signage</h3>
<p>Generally, brothels and festhalls lacked any exterior signage indicating what or whom they catered to, leaving it on locals having the wherewithal to know. Often the proprietors of inns and taverns were more than happy to discretely answer queries of where someone could find one that would cater to their needs.</p>
<p>Some brothels and festhalls placed a discrete, carved wooden plaque in a shield shape on their entry door to signal that their proprietor was open to discussing catering to unusual desires, though not any particular services. There were two competing styles of badge, though how they came about was lost to history. The first style was of a carved or painted depiction of owl feathers—if painted, the feathers would be barred brown, beige, and white—with their pointed quills on the sinister (left-hand side) and their feather-ends on the dexter (right-hand side). The second style replaced the central feather with a depiction of a dagger , facing the opposite direction of the feathers (hilt to the left, point to the right).</p>
<p>In the country of Tashalar , as well as the regions known as the Border Kingdoms and Vilhon Reach , there was a practice of modifying these doorpost designs to signal if an establishment offered only same-sex services. Those that catered to only 'male-on-male' displayed parallel diagonal daggers, situated in the bottom-left and upper-right portions of the shield, with both pointing in the latter direction. Those that catered to only 'female-on-female' instead displayed daggers with broken tips, pointing down to the lower-left.</p>
<p>In regards to freelance escorts, particularly in Cormyr, it was quite common to place and light a lantern on the interior windowsill of their private residence as a signal that they were both home and open to conducting business.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>While this industry might be considered in some places or by some individuals as a 'vice' ( i.e. , an immoral practice) or 'debauchery', most of the Realms was made up of sexually liberated societies, where even youths could be found knowledgeable of various sexual acts.</p>
<p>Even so, many in polite society found it crude to speak bluntly of the topic, as shown by to the wide range of euphemisms in existence. If not judged by society for their profession itself, a prostitute could be judged by others for being unhygienic, unskilled, or needlessly wanton. And to some, prostitutes were seen as outcasts, people for whom it wouldn't be noticed if they went missing. Some judgy goodwives and gossips would even try to paint uncleanliness and licentious behavior as characteristic of escorts. As for festhalls, in some places it was considered embarrassing to be caught going to one—this was not the case in Waterdeep.</p>
<p>On rare occasions, a brothel could prove to be the unlikely birthplace of a future adventurer . Notable examples of this were the hero Torm , a member of the Knights of Myth Drannor , and the would-be-god Cyric .</p>
<h3>Clothing</h3>
<p>The manner of dress for a prostitute varied from place to place, as they typically garbed themselves in whatever was locally allowed. In areas where people dressed more conservatively, for example, female escorts were fully clothed, albeit in garments that were held together with a series of rings to show off a strip of bare skin, all the way up their leg and torso. Such styles of clothing served as visual indicators to prospective clients that the escort was someone who desired being approached.</p>
<p>In areas where fashion was less conservative, an escort might garb herself in thin, low-cut dresses or blouses, regardless of winter air. Some wore beads or coins strung on ropes as decorative chains.</p>
<p>In the case of festhall escorts, some establishments provided their workers a specific form of dress; a trademark of the House of Purple Silks in Waterdeep was the sheer purple silken clothing worn by its escorts.</p>
<p>Many lady escorts were also known for their propensity for using makeup , such as mrathaera . Sometimes the makeup of an escort was derisively described by others as being "over painted". And for those escorts who lacked the luxury of regularly bathing , liberal use of perfume was used to cover up any malodorous odor, with body fragrances that were rather cheap.</p>
<h3>Demographics</h3>
<p>While the majority of escorts in the Realms were made up of humans and demihumans , one could sometimes encounter escorts that were of other races, such as lizardfolk or sprites . Even doppelgangers could be found working at some festhalls. Some were scandalously rumored to be welcomed by some festhall proprietors on account of their general skills and adaptability, but other times they were working covertly beneath a brothel-keeper's notice.</p>
<p>In the late 14 th to 15 th centuries DR, tieflings became quite popular as escorts, particularly in Amn and Waterdeep, due to many folk thinking of them as dangerous and relationships with them illicit. To this end, some festhalls especially sought them out as hires. Similarly, it was not uncommon for the misfortunate disabled masses of Faerûn to fall into being hired by brothels to provide specialized pleasures to their clientele.</p>
<p>In his notes for an unpublished manuscript on hags and witches , the famed monster hunter Rudolph Van Richten claimed that some changelings of green hags , those who lacked a drive for the performing arts, invariably ended up working in brothels.</p>
<p>In terms of age, people ranging from the young to the very old and wrinkled could be found selling their services in various parts of the Realms.</p>
<h3>Distribution</h3>
<p>Some of the many settlements on the continent of Faerûn where prostitution was seen in practice, either legally or illegally, were Almraiven , Ankhapur , Arabel , Arrabar , Athkatla , Baldur's Gate , Bargewright Inn , Beregost , Berdusk , Bezantur , Brynnlaw, Caer Callidyrr , Calaunt , Calimport , Carradoon , Citadel of the Raven , Dagger Falls , Dusklan , Elturel , Essembra , Eveningstar , Halruaa , Hill's Edge , Hillsfar , Hlondeth , Hulburg , Immersea , Immurk's Hold , Innarlith , Iriaebor , Juniril , Khôltar , Longsaddle , Luskan , Luthcheq , Lyrabar , Maeruhal , Manshaka , Marsember , Mimph , Mirabar , Moontassel , Mosstone , Neverwinter , Noanar's Hold , Oeble , Ordulin , Ormpetarr , Ormpur , Procampur , Purl , Pyarados , Ramekho , Ravens Bluff , Red Larch , Riatavin , Saradush , Scardale , Scornubel , Selgaunt , Shadowdale , Silverymoon , Snowtown , Spandeliyon , Starmantle , Sundabar , Surthay , Suzail , Tantras , Telflamm , Tilverton , Trademeet , Triboar , Tyraturos , Ulark , Uthmere , Velen , Veltalar , Waterdeep, Westgate , Wheloon , Yartar , Yhaunn , Zazesspur, and Zhentil Keep.</p>
<p>In terms of countries or general regions, prostitution had been noted at various places in Amn , the Border Kingdoms, Calimshan, the Moonsea North , Mulhorand , Sembia , the Sword Coast North , Tashalar, Tethyr , the Vilhon Reach, and other parts of Southern Faerûn . More broadly, modest festhalls and brothels could be found in most caravan stops and ports throughout the Realms, no matter how small or rural. And some escorts were found to travel across Faerûn, sometimes alongside caravans or armies that were traveling beyond their borders for war, even going to such far-flung places as the freezing mining settlement of Fireshear .</p>
<p>In the Underdark , the settlement of Tradesport was famed for its brothels, which were said to be the best in all of the subterranean realms. Other settlements in the Underdark known for having escorts included the svirfneblin city-state of Blingdenstone with its Golden Hills Hearth , the drow city-state of Ched Nasad , Iltkazar with its Merciful Court , Skullport , Sshamath , the drow city of Ust Natha in its sole tavern , and the drow city-state of Menzoberranzan . One had to look hard to find the city's brothels, though most were situated in the districts of Duthcloim and Narbondellyn . Nearly all of Menzoberranzan's brothels exclusively employed male prostitutes, the one exception being the Jewel Box , which prostituted enslaved female drow that were smuggled-in prisoners of war. Beyond brothels, a number of destitute drow in the impoverished Braeryn district worked the streets as lady escorts, soliciting to creatures of any race.</p>
<p>Beyond the continent of Faerûn, women of the evening could be found in the city-state of Huzuz in interior Zakhara . In the land of Kara-Tur , prostitution was the domain of the yujo or korobi geisha , geisha who were trained in the art of sex. On the island nation of Wa they were notably found in the pleasure districts of Chozawa , Nakamaru , and Semmishi . Generally only the wealthy and powerful could afford their services. In the neighboring Hordelands , brothels could be found outside the walls of Port Ghaast .</p>
<p>Beyond their homelands, skilled Kara-Turan escorts, as well as other skilled escorts from across Faerûn, could be found at the Goblet and Gems in Mirabar. Similarly, the Tesh Inn boasted professional escorts from far-away Calimshan, Chessenta , and Chult .</p>
<p>Past the Prime Material , the city of Grodd had brothels, parts of the Domains of Dread saw prostitution, and prostitution could be found in the floating city of Sigil , particularly in its Hive Ward .</p>
<p>Prostitutes sometimes congregated in, or were restricted to, certain areas of settlements. In Athkatla, courtesans typically lived along the Path of Silk Flowers , while in Waterdeep a fair few prostitutes lived on the upper floors of buildings along Theln Lane , where they were known to drop rope ladders down from their balconies to awaiting clients. In Zazesspur, brothels had their own discreetly fortified subdivision within the Players' Quarter .</p>
<p>Many escorts were found to ply their trade on the Street of Lanterns in Iriaebor; Deekin Street in Neverwinter; Furlough Street in Skullport; Phorn's Lane in Tilverton; Howling Cat Court , Jester's Court , Street of Whispers , and Two Flask Alley in Waterdeep; Thorn Lane in Yartar; and Thread-Biters' Lane in Zazesspur. In the city of Calimport, they were found in what was referred to as "Red Veil Sabbans" – one of these could be found in nearly every ward, such as the Qhibal Sabban of the Shackles Ward .</p>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>Among the Faerûnian pantheon , festhalls were solely within the portfolio of the goddess Sharess , known to some by the titles of "Festhall Madam" or "Patroness of Festhalls". She was revered by professional escorts that took pride in their job. Small shrines to Sharess could be found in almost every festhall in Faerûn and many Sharessan priests and priestesses ran pleasure houses in large cities, such as the Sharess' Caress in Baldur's Gate and The Cat's Meow in Ordulin.</p>
<p>In some places, professional escorts viewed the wild festivals held by Lliirans as disruptive to their business, as for many those nights of revelry led to trysts. Such was the case in the city of Hill's Edge with its temple Cry of Joy . And in some instances the Church of Sune were found to run festhalls, such as the Smiling Siren . In general though, temples of the Faerûnian faiths didn't operate overt brothels, nor did they seek to compete with or eliminate free-enterprise prostitution.</p>
<p>Among the Dark Seldarine , some drow prostitutes revered the goddess Zinzerena , with some even serving her as clerics .</p>
<p>More malevolently, cults dedicated to the archdevil Glasya and the demon prince Malcanthet tended to operate brothels as fronts for their temples. Moreover, aspects of Malcanthet were interested in and sought out the same sorts of worshipers as the Church of Sharess. And the Order of the Dark Caress , an Amnian Sharran cult, recruited prostitutes through the promise that Shar would provide them beauty and long lives.</p>
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<h3>Euphemisms for the Service</h3>
<p>Many clients or establishments in the Realms were seen to use euphemisms to refer to sexual services. This included such terms as "companionship", "favors for coin" or simply "favors", "privacy", "renting their charms", "social purposes", and "warmshoulders service" in Sembia. In the city of Yartar, a common euphemism used for those going to Thorn Lane was to say they were going there to "improve their cultural relations."</p>
<p>One colloquial term for those seeking to employ the services of an escort was "brothel cruiser".</p>
<h3>Procuring</h3>
<p>Organizers of prostitution may be known as pimps or procurers if male, or madams , matrons , mothers , mistresses , or procuresses if female. Alternatively, the terms panderer or wencher could be used regardless of gender. And the term doxy was sometimes used to refer to a group of madams who oversaw a select roster of male prostitutes. Matrons could often be just as alluring as the escorts they managed and sharing in their proclivity for makeup.</p>
<h3>Euphemisms & Terms for Workers</h3>
<p>There existed a wide range of both general and specialized terms used across the various regions of the Realms for prostitutes. These terms of address shifted based upon the time, place, and the social standing of either an escort or the individual describing them. Below are some of the many that have been documented:</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Prostitutes sometimes banded together to form organizations for the purposes of mutual aid and protection. Some such groups included the Aged Evening Escorts Benevolent Trust in Marsember, the banditeering Raunstrar , and the Reveler's Union of Baldur's Gate. In major cities, most professional escorts were known to join formal or informal guilds that were led by Sharessan priests.</p>
<p>In the Backlands , there were the Halfway Ladies, a group of mostly moon elf escorts that frequently did business at the isolated Halfway Inn . They were notorious for their high-class manners and style of dress.</p>
