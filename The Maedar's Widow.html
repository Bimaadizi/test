<p>The Maedar's Widow was a shop in the Upper Trade Lanes of Skullport in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Maedar's Widow was a two-story building in good condition.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Maedar's Widow specialized in creating lifelike, one-of-a-kind statues, "captured" in stone rather than sculpted. The owner of the shop, a medusa named Morganis Andropoea , acquired able-bodied slaves from the Slavers' Market in the Lower Port , carefully attired them in elaborate garments and uniforms befitting their intended display, then positioned them in carefully curated poses. Once satisfied, she subjected them to her petrifying gaze, transforming them into flawless stone figures of eerie realism.</p>
<p>These sculptures were then meticulously crated and shipped to the halls and estates of the wealthy and indulgent, particularly in Waterdeep , where they commanded exorbitant prices due to their unsettling authenticity and craftsmanship. Her work has found particular favor among certain nobles who had taken to displaying these living sculptures as centerpieces in their collections, oblivious, or indifferent, to the grisly nature of their creation.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Maedar's Widow was named in memory of Morganis's late husband, Holmyrr , a maedar slain nearly three decades ago by an adventuring party . Morganis fled to Skullport following his death and established her macabre trade in sculptures.</p>
