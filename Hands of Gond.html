<p>The Hands of Gond was an organization of elite agents who served the Ayrorch , or the Council of Twelve of Lantan .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The agents of the Hands of Gond could hound wrongdoers on behalf of the Council of Twelve relentlessly and covertly, as all members were equipped with hats of disguise . They also were armed with magical implements and weapons whose powers were strange and unknown to outsiders.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR , the hin thief named Jonslyn Windtongue managed to steal of Lantanna spellwebs . These weapons fed off magic, enchantments, and spells, unleashed and still within a caster's mind, and as such, spellwebs were rumored to be weapons used in defense of Lantan from pirates and other invading forces. The Ayrorch dispatched the Hands of Gond to find the halfling thief and return what was stolen by all means.</p>
