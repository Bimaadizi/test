<p>Larethian was a religious tome dedicated to the elvish deity Corellon Larethian , penned by Palmer Junisugga sometime before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>The book claimed that the race of elves was created by Corellon's tears, mixed with tears of Sehanine Moonbow , the elvish deity known as the Lady of Dreams. The author found that fact curious, as it was the physiological reverse of a common creation myth. The elves were created from an expression of sorrow rather than being formed from the deity's hip bone or other bodily bits. Some sages theorized that this act of creation was countering Corellon's feelings of loss and betrayal at the time. Another opinion on the subject shared in the book came from the sage Aephir Loquellan , an elf who believed that the species being born from tears meant elves were "as sad as a species can be," due to elves enduring the burdens of living for numerous centuries.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a copy of Larethian was available to guests of the Stormshore Tabernacle among many other religious books for perusal. It was also sold at The Bibliophile , a book shop in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate. Another copy was kept in the sinister House of Hope , the abode of a powerful devil Raphael in Avernus .</p>
