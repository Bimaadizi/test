<p>Painspeakers were undead creatures that wielded truespeak . What all of them had in common was that they were in life a person who had an unspoken message to relay.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Painspeakers appeared as near-skeletal humans , with grayish flesh pulled taut across their bones. Painspeakers resembled the creatures they were when they were alive. While their appearance was fearful, they became truly horrid when they spoke with their inhuman, gravely voices. Each syllable they uttered was rife with visceral evil, with the undercurrent of some ancient forgotten language beneath their words.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Painspeakers were created from those that died before their message was delivered, whether they were a courier or a lover who never professed their love. They rose because of the words they had never uttered, and were cursed to blight others with their truename magic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Painspeakers had a long history of being connected to important events.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Instead of employing a broad selection of truename utterances, a painspeaker uttered only the reversed form of the moderate word of nurturing but could do so all day, two or three times a minute. They typically limited their physical attacks, actively uttering the recitation of the fortified state to improve their defenses between utterances of pain, swinging sucker punches at creatures that lowered their guard to attack or to flee.</p>
<p>In addition to their truespeech utterings, painspeakers possessed darkvision and other traits common to the undead .</p>
