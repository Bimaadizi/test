<p>Forks were a kind of handheld utensil used in cooking and eating, widely appreciated for their ability to stab and hold onto things.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Common, everyday forks were used in kitchens and dining rooms for preparing and eating food, alongside spoons and knives . They had at least two tines (any fewer and they would simply be a skewer ) and usually topped out at four. Cheap ones were commonly made from brass , while fancier ones used silver .</p>
<p>The much larger pitchfork was used for farm work, and fully-fledged polearms such as tridents , fauchards , and military forks took the idea to its logical conclusion. By comparison, the planar fork was named for its shape, not its stabbing ability.</p>
