<p>Dorigen Kel Lamond was an evil wizard in service to Castle Trinity in the Snowflake Mountains in the mid–14 th century DR . She took part in the attack against Shilmista and caused much ruin to the elves . But after Cadderly Bonaduce spared her, she gradually underwent a change of heart, ultimately sacrificing herself at the Edificant Library in an attempt to save her new-found friends from vampires.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Of middle age, Dorigen had long black hair with strands of gray that she wore long, though unkempt. Her eyes were amber colored. Her nose had obviously been broken and forever bent to the side, after she fell on her face while practicing a magically enhanced jump. Danica thought that she looked like Pertelope .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dorigen was the only woman among the wizards of Castle Trinity, but Aballister considered her the best at sorcery.</p>
<p>At Aballister Bonaduce 's behest, in the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR , she went to Shilmista with Druzil to aid Ragnor in the war effort to dominate Carradoon , as well as to prevent Ragnor from finding himself too powerful to decide he no longer needed Castle Trinity. She proved herself to Ragnor with her magical prowess and used Kierkan Rufo as a pawn to ambush and capture Cadderly, Danica , and Elbereth .</p>
<p>She spoke with Cadderly, deeming him to be a valuable source of information and teasing him about his past. However, Danica managed to free herself and with Ivan and Pikel Bouldershoulder they drove the wizard away. Discredited, she returnd to Ragnor, who had been successful in his last move against the elves.</p>
<p>When Cadderly awoke the ancient trees of Syldritch Trea , she tried destroying them with her ring but Cadderly managed to distract her and hit her with a dart poisoned with drow sleeping poison . He then broke her fingers with his walking stick, preventing her from casting magic for a long time, but he refrained from killing her as Danica and others proposed.</p>
<p>Cadderly's mercy would prove to be well-placed, as it enabled Dorigen to re-evaluate her path in life. She received Aballister's plan to hire the Night Masks to kill his son with mixed feelings, but she could not understand how Aballister could deal with Cadderly so coldly. In trying to scry Cadderly's position, she felt that he would reach Castle Trinity sooner than expected, but withheld that information from Aballister.</p>
<p>She eventually aided Cadderly and his friends to defeat Aballister and bring down Castle Trinity when she gave them the password to Aballister's room and private mansion, after surrendering to them peacefully. She declared a truce until the matter between Cadderly and Aballister was settled and went to assist Cadderly's friends along with Danica. They later wanted to return to the Edificant Library and Dorigen awaited judgement for her involvement with Castle Trinity's ambitions.</p>
<p>But winter arrived before they could reach it, and Dorigen stayed with the party in a cave system until the snow receded without trying to escape. While being technically captive, she felt among friends for the first time in her life and assisted Danica and Shayleigh in their fight against trolls . The following year, the Year of the Helm, 1362 DR , Dorigen even offered to help the elves of Shilmista battle an onslaught from those orcs who'd attacked the forest before, which would help her case before the court of the Edificant Library.</p>
<p>When Kierkan Rufo became a vampire and attempted to turn Dorigen, she chose to destroy herself with a fireball , trying to help Danica escape and taking as many undead with her as possible rather than live as his evil slave. Cadderly found her charred body, but Kierkan kept her in a state of undeath to spite Cadderly. However, Dorigen retained her will and was not turned away or pained by Cadderly's priestly command . He agreed to lay her to rest so that her spirit could go on to paradise, redeemed, but not before she told him that she loved him for his goodness, and that her only regret was that she would not see him marry Danica.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>She initially hated Cadderly for leaving her hands crooked and swollen, but she steadily changed her mind, considering that he spared her life. She started to watch him in curiosity and considered him a formidable opponent.</p>
<p>Aballister Bonaduce was her mentor and former lover. She once loved him, but later despised him when he physically was a shadow of his former self, though still feared him and acknowledged his power. She continued to serve under him, but had a slow change of heart after Cadderly spared her, realizing they were only together for convenience. She thought him insane after he sent a powerful storm against Cadderly and laughed at his son's survival, deeming it a challenge. She betrayed him when she told Cadderly how to access Aballister's mansion and let them go without opposition.</p>
<p>Danica did not like her, but she respected her and even trusted her. She noted that there was an attraction between Cadderly and Dorigen, which she attributed to Dorigen's resemblance to Pertelope. She even worried about Dorigen's fate at the hands of the Edificant Library, hoping her life would be spared.</p>
<p>As the lowest-ranking mage in Castle Trinity, Dorigen had no respect for Bogo Rath and treated him disdainfully, calling him "Boygo". She fumed at what she thought was his ludicrous haircut.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Dorigen wore a ring with the crest of Talona , a golden ring that enhanced her magic powers, and an onyx ring that could cast the spell Aganazzar's scorcher . It was taken by Cadderly during the fight at the forests of Shilmista. She also carried a wand that could emanate dim, normal, or blinding light with the command words domin illu , illu , or mas illu , respectively.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Dorigen was a considerably powerful spellcaster, capable of casting protective wards that caused explosions of blue flame, and the spells flaming sphere , prestidigitation , detect thoughts , burning hands , shocking grasp , shield , , dimension door , invisibility , arcane eye , fireball , lightning bolt , web , and mage hand , which she could use to deliver touch-based spells such as shield . She could also cast a spell to connect two minds and allow them to psychically duel. According to Aballister, she was very skilled in the art of clairvoyance and scrying . After her activities in Shilmista, she had trouble casting spells, since they required precise hand motions and her damaged hands posed an obstacle.</p>
