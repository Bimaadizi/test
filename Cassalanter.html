<p>The Cassalanter ( pronounced : /ˈ k æs ɑː l ɑː n t ɛ r / CASS-ah-lan-ter , or : /ˈ k ɑː s ɑː l ɑː n t ɛ r / KAS-ah-lan-ter ) noble house of Waterdeep was among one of the richest families within the city, having made their fortune in banking, money-lending and rumor-mongering for the highest payer.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The family had a villa in the Sea Ward , on the southwest corner of Delzorin Street and Diamond Street .</p>
<p>The Cassalanter family had an ancient burial crypt in the Dungeon Level of Undermountain with several of the family ancestors interred there. A Shrine of Myrkul was the part of the family crypt.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>House Cassalanter was ennobled in the Year of the Cockatrice, 1248 DR when the Lords of Waterdeep recognized several merchant houses and granted them noble titles and seals.</p>
<p>In 1368 DR , Cassalanters loaned two ten-million golden lions with a huge interest rate. The first loan was to Widow Silvermane who ran a lottery in the North Ward of Waterdeep, and the second one went to the Field of Triumph Race Track in the Sea Ward . The astronomical loans were caused by goddess Tymora's luck going out of control all over the Realms. Every single gambler picked the winning number and winning horses , costing Widow Silvermane and the Field of Triumph disastrous losses.</p>
<p>In 1370 DR , a skeleton dressed in Cassalanter family garb was seen attacking several Waterdhavians. These incidents attracted the attention of the city's Lords of Waterdeep . The undead came from the family's old crypt in Undermountain , and a lone hero was sent to investigate the restless Cassalanter ancestors. The hero successfully destroyed the undead and the ghoul necromancer behind the infestation, Ghoulmaster and the noble family offered a hefty reward for the deed.</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, the Cassalanters faced imminent bankruptcy. In order to prevent it, in 1489 DR Ammalia and Victoro struck a deal with the archdevil Asmodeus , trading the souls of their children in exchange for instant financial comeback. Their eldest son, Osvaldo, was taken immediately and transformed into a chain devil , while the younger twins Elzerina and Terenzio were scheduled to be taken on the occasion of their 9 th birthday, one tenday after Founders' Day of 1492 DR .</p>
<p>Sometime before 1492 DR, one of the Ladies of House Cassalanter caused quite a stir by wearing a gown colored with a certain variety of loud maroon dye to one of her grand parties that took place in the Sea Ward of Waterdeep.</p>
