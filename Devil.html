<p>Devils were a lawful evil race of fiends who hailed from the Nine Hells of Baator .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Devils were vicious creatures who were capable of attacking and killing others for essentially no reason. However, they hated being the target of misery themselves. This led to another trait of devils, their extreme vindictiveness combined with a lack of ability to accept their mistakes. Devils had an instinct to look for others to blame when they suffered setbacks and had the drive to exact vengeance against whomever they held responsible, even when they were demoted to a weaker station. For example, the grandson or granddaughter of a dead being who was indirectly involved in the demotion of devil was an eligible target for the demoted devil, even after it managed to be re-promoted.</p>
<p>Devils often delegated their work to others. This did not mean that they were lazy, however, as the primary personality trait for any devil was ambition. They constantly looked for ways for promotion. The goal behind this behavior was the fulfillment of the devil's own desires. They tried to rise up the hierarchy to modify rules in ways that suited them. This was the root of their dedication to the cause of lawful evil.</p>
<p>These fiends had some tendency to act on emotion, especially when faced with the prospect of vengeance, and with enough provocation, could be made to act in ways that were detrimental to their ultimate goal, up to death in pursuit of such vengeance.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Devils often had magical abilities. A large number of devils had an aura of fear, which they used to split enemy groups apart. Most devils had some kind of illusion abilities, which were used to sow confusion among their foes. A common use of these powers was to create illusory support for themselves. They abused their enemies' inability to distinguish between illusory and real summoned support. A devil with divine magic was usually not a priest of a god but one who received the necessary magic from Asmodeus or one of the other archdevils.</p>
<h3>Blood War</h3>
<p>Devils were at a stark numerical disadvantage in the Blood War , where they fought demons . The devils, though, had many advantages against the chaotic demons, such as better equipment, morale, and the ability to employ tactics. All in all, the victory-defeat ratio of the devils was about 50:50.</p>
<h3>Tactics</h3>
<p>Being at a severe numerical disadvantage against the demons, they developed a number of strategies to fight against them, which were also used against others. First, devils never fought on Baator when they could help it. The reason for this was that they would actually perish if they died on Baator. Secondly, a lot of devils had the ability to use greater teleport . They made frequent use of hit-and-run-tactics using this ability. In general, they attacked a group of enemies, teleported away, healed themselves, and started anew.</p>
<p>When devils fought in a more long term way against their enemies, they attacked in ways that curtailed their enemies' combat abilities in a lasting manner. For example, it was common for them to sneak up and kill off animal companions and similar creatures.</p>
<p>When fighting anything alive, the devils' combat philosophy was to securely kill their enemies. For example, when they knocked another being unconscious, they did not believe that their job was done. First, a devil killed the unconscious enemy and then took on the next enemy. This was done to kill any chance that the unconscious one could return to the fight, for example by receiving magical healing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when they fought on the Prime, they knew that dying would not kill them, but they also knew that dying there might cost them a lot including their rank. Therefore, they had no problems of running away, when a battle did not go their way. A devil did not need a lot of time to find out, whether the battle was in its favor or not, because a devil always went all out in a fight. For example, they tried to use their summoning powers as early as possible to summon allies into strategically beneficial positions. They went as far as fighting in a noisy manner, for example by constantly screaming. This allowed their allies to notice them, and would thus potentially aid them in battle. When devils had the chance, they tried to deplete their enemies' resources by sending their underlings to engage the enemies. When they did this, they usually kept tabs on the importance of those they sent away. Those who were less important were sent first and those who were important were only sent, if the responsible devil thought that the enemy was beatable in one stroke.</p>
<h3>After a Battle</h3>
<p>Provided a devil did not kill its enemies or was actually defeated, the future of the mortals involved was grim. The most common fates for a devil's enemies were:</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>The vast majority of devils were baatezu . They lived in strict caste society. Devils continuously tried to improve their station in life. The measure by which promotion was granted was the number of mortals swayed to corruption. The swayed mortals' souls were the source of energy on which the devils' society was built. The Pact Primeval , a contract between Asmodeus and gods, was the legal basis on which the devils' right to corrupt mortals was based on.</p>
<h3>Economy</h3>
<h3>Hierarchy</h3>
<p>The devils had a number of castes. At the bottom of the hierarchy were the least devils. They were treated badly by all others and the numbers of advancement opportunities were very limited. Above the least were the lesser devils. Generally, they were employed in the soul trade, a field where advancement opportunities were numerous. Above the lesser were the greater devils headed by the pit fiends . They were the ones who held a high degree of authority in the infernal society. However, they were not the top. That position was held by the archdevils who were directly served by unique devils holding the title of duke. Among the Lord of the Nine, Asmodeus, the top of that group, was a class onto himself.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the higher a devil stood, the more chances for further advancement existed. However, the higher a devil stood, the more oversight a devil had to suffer at the hands of its superiors, and the more they were exposed to the prospect of punishment and demotion. As a result, high-ranking devils were fearful of demotion and vented their fears on their subordinates in a violent manner. This made said subordinates act in a similar manner towards their subordinates and so on until the literal bottom of the hierarchy was met.</p>
<p>When a devil managed to corrupt a mortal, his or her soul landed in Baator on death. Such souls had a unique mark that could be attributed to the devil that was then credited with the corruption of the mortal. Accruing these credits was basis for a devil's promotion. Another form of accruing credits was to provide Baator with material goods. This form of gaining credits was not held as high as providing Baator with souls but devils who were looking for ways to improve their résumé did this nonetheless.</p>
<h3>Gaining Credits</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, devils coveted mortal souls. They consistently tried to change a mortal's ethical and moral outlook into that of a lawful evil person. When the person died in that state, that mortal's soul went to Baator and the devil who had the biggest hand in the mortal's outlook's change got the credit for it. When a devil managed to change a mortal's outlook, it often tried to organize the death of that person. The reason for this were twofold. First, that way, the mortal died, his or her soul went to Baator and the devil got its credit without waiting the mortal's lifespan expired. Second, that way, the devil also killed the possibility of the mortal's outlook changing again into some other outlook, which would shunt his or her soul into some place that was not Baator, thus depriving the devil of its credit. However, on macro level devils needed mortals. They were useful to change the outlook of their fellows as well as to pursue other infernal agendas on the Prime for Baator. Therefore, devils needed to acquire permission to kill somebody to send his or her soul to Baator for each and every case.</p>
<p>There were various methods to gain credits for a devil:</p>
<h3>Blood War</h3>
<p>The devils' society was built with two main activities in its mind: gaining souls to harvest energy and fighting the Blood War . On the infernal side, Avernus was the primary battle ground. Fighting the Blood War was the other occupation devils could pursue for their careers. Those who fought in the Blood War were exempt from meeting any quota of souls and could still receive promotions by virtue of their military deeds. There was something of a rivalry between soul harvesters and Blood War veterans. The former claimed superiority because it was the energy they harvested that allowed the latter to fight at all, while the latter claimed superiority because the leisure to harvest souls at all was guaranteed by the veterans. Among unique devils, only Bel was continuously engaged in the Blood War for fighting it was considered necessary but not interesting enough for them to do.</p>
<p>The devils winning condition regarding defending Baator from the demons was to keep Avernus from falling into their hands. The reason for this was that the entire plane of Baator had a magical condition that made it impossible for demons to teleport from one layer to the next. So, the demons needed to take one layer at a time to win and reconsecrate the entire thing before moving on. Keeping Avernus from them, prevented this from happening.</p>
<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, devils picked up eating and drinking good food and drink or sexuality as some form of hobby. They could not get drunk or otherwise alter their minds with substances. It was also not well-seen. However, there were a number of magical substances that were imbibed as a substitute for drugs. Gughalaki made in Maladomini from fiendish giant centipedes was drunk as a hallucinogen, infernal wine made in Phlegethos from fire grapes was drunk like wine, and Screecher , a substance which had a dulling effect on low-ranking devils, were some examples of such substances.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, getting drunk or otherwise taking mind-altering substances was not well-seen and often outright forbidden. The aforementioned substances were usually handed to devils as a form of rewards or in the context of rituals. The one group of devils that had the position to take these substances on any regular basis were high-ranking devils. However, this was acknowledged as hypocritical for they were the same ones who forbade it to their subordinates.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Devils had numerous forms but one organ called the ovatorium was shared by all of them. It was a mushy and white organ consisting of sacs, inside of which were miniature versions of devil-forms. On promotion, meaning changing into a specific form, the corresponding sac's content grew until it burst through the skin of the old form and the promotion was done.</p>
<h3>Senses</h3>
<p>Quite a lot of devils could see in darkness. Being able to see while lacking light was normal for outsiders. The devils' case was different, because their vision could also penetrate magical darkness like that of deeper darkness . However, their senses had some peculiarities. They sensed everything in a destructive and/or despairing light. For example, a flower looked wilted in some places no matter its health. They could well distinguish the smell differences between a cesspit and good perfume , but devils registered these differences not as one being more pleasant than the other but as one being less unpleasant than the other.</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Devils did not need to eat or drink. This did not mean they could not. To them eating and drinking were either a hobby, where fine food and drink was concerned, or a show of power and domination, when they were eating one of their enemies.</p>
<p>It was not clear if devil flesh was poisonous, carried disease or parasites, or if it was edible in general; some mad adventurers of Faerûn claimed to have tried it, but their claims could not be verified, and it was fully possible that doing so was the cause of their mental state.</p>
<h3>Reproduction</h3>
<p>The majority of devils started their life as dead mortals turned into lemures . Reproduction by sexual means was almost impossible for devils because female ones were not capable of becoming pregnant, with the exceptions being brachinas and erinyes . Still, male ones could father half-fiends with mortals. Other exceptions to this rule of female infertility were the unique devils. Among them, both male and female ones were fertile and a child between them was also a unique devil. However, this rarely happened, for a child as powerful as an unique devil was a dangerous asset if it turned on its parents and infernal society did not create stable relationships of loyalty between parents and children. A third group of devils came spontaneously into being from the plane or part of Baator. A fourth category, that of erinyes, were fallen angels .</p>
<p>In general, sexuality was enjoyed more like a hobby by devils and among them far more often by the powerful than the weak.</p>
<h3>Death</h3>
<p>A devil that died on Baator was truly dead. When a devil died outside of Baator, it changed, over three to nine minutes, into some slimy substance that was mildly poisonous but not lethally so—if somebody came up with the idea to eat it. On Baator, the killed devil came back, fully recovered and in the form it was killed in; however, it took them ninety-nine years until they took their old form. Quite often, especially when the devil in question was of low rank, demotion awaited the slain devil.</p>
<p>Devils had eternal life and youth. A devil that did not look healthy was either under some curse or supernatural disease or was somehow cut off from a sufficient supply of divine energy.</p>
<p>One way to kill them was to somehow cause them to suffocate, since devils still needed oxygen—albeit in very small amounts—to live.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>There were various stories about the origins of the devils.</p>
<h3>Origin Story - Pact Primeval</h3>
<p>According to one origin story, the devils were originally angels that were created to fight for the cause of law against demons . The most effective at it was an angel called Asmodeus . Those angels who followed that one were the future devils.</p>
<h2>Types of devils</h2>
<p>There were many different kinds of devils, including some subcategories.</p>
<h3>Other Devils</h3>
<h3>Archdevils</h3>
<p>Archdevils were powerful, unique devils. They were the rulers of the devils and of Baator (the Nine Hells). Archdevils were considered a form of archfiends .</p>
