<p>Clan Gethmara was one of the dragonborn clans of the nation of Tymanther .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point prior to 1479 DR , nearly all prominent members of Clan Gethmara were killed in what was known as the "Gethmara massacre". Many blamed Clan Vkriss as the perpetrators of the deed, but there was no evidence of Clan Vkriss involvement in the crime.</p>
