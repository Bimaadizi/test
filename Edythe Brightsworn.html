<p>Lady Edythe Brightsworn was a knight of Lathander that proved her devotion to the Morninglord during the latter half of the 13 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was a devout paladin of Lathander who accumulated a fair amount of wealth that she used to carry out a holy quest in her god's name.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Lady Brightsworn commissioned the Circlet of the Cynosure , a magical headband that offered her protection from charm magic and debilitating fear.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time around the late 1260's DR , Lady Brightsworn brought together a group of warriors to hunt down one particularly powerful vampire . The group traced the undead fiend to the City of the Dead , the graveyard district of Waterdeep , and ventured into the subterranean tunnels that held its lair.</p>
<p>The vampire slaughtered nearly every member of the expedition, one after the other, including Lady Brightsworn. Only one member survived, leaving the collapsed tunnels carrying the lady's enchanted circlet. The whereabouts of the vampire were entirely unknown.</p>
