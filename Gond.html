<p>Gond ( pronounced : /ˈ g ɑː n d / GAHND or : /ˈ g ɒn d / GOND listen ) and as Zionil in the Shining Lands , was the Faerûnian god of craft, smithing, and inventiveness. The Lord of All Smiths had many forms and names, and under all of them pushed for innovation and imaginativeness, sometimes to a dangerous degree, as a result of his short-sighted desire to create.</p>
<p>Gond was also known as Nebelun ( pronounced : /ˈ n ɛ b ɛ l ə n / NEHB-eh-luhn ) among gnomes of the Realms, who venerated him alongside the other Lords of the Golden Hills . The Six Secret Names of Gond were (in appropriate order): Aranlaerus , Balateng , Daerosdaeros , Klannauda , Mrangor , and Tattaba .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Avatars of Gond took several forms, including that of a brawny, red-hued smith, a short, slight man with straw-blond hair, or a gnome . No matter his form, Gond had a forge-scarred face with dark (but nonetheless sharp and bright) eyes and a constantly attentive and inquisitive expression. He wore ordinary leathers under his scorched smith smock, though he could also summon a set of glassteel plate armor over himself (hovering close to his body piece by piece rather than actually encasing him) at will.</p>
<p>Gond's manifestations included a forge hammer wrapped with wisps of black smoke, or striking eyes set within dark clouds with the ringing sounds of hammers on anvils .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The divine personality of the Wonderbringer was as varied as his desire to innovate was intense. He would at times act wholly disciplined and methodical, while at others become easily distracted. He was just as often insightful and accommodating as he was sardonic or condescending.</p>
<p>Gond remained ever-concerned with making real any theoretical concept or schematic, and held little concern for any complications or problems that arose therefrom. He would readily accept commissions from any unscrupulous patron, so long as compensation was substantial and he was given opportunity to create novel and innovative devices.</p>
<p>Gond was not anti-magic as some may think, but viewed magic as simply another means by which to craft new inventions.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The god of invention posses immense strength and immunity to any firearms , or any weapon that had been crafting by means of smithing, forging or otherwise worked with tools made of metal . In fact any mundane metal weapon that struck Gond's form, immediately disintegrated .</p>
<p>At will, Gond could disjunct any nearby magical items .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Gond possessed a mighty Hammer of Thunderbolts called Craftmaster , that he used both as a tool at his divine forge and (if needed) as a weapon.</p>
<h2>Divine Realm</h2>
<p>Gond's divine realm was the plane of Wonderhome , which manifested as a grand library in the House of Knowledge within the Outlands .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h3>Deities</h3>
<p>Along with Milil , Deneir , and Oghma , Gond was one of the Deities of Knowledge and Invention . He was on relatively good terms with Oghma, though sometimes their relationship could be tense, due to Gond's tendency to push new inventions being rapidly introduced across Faerûn without thinking of the consequences. His relationship with Milil was strained as they had little in common. Beyond the Deities of Knowledge and Invention, Gond was known to have a friendly rivalry with Chauntea , the Goddess of Bounty, and amiable relationships with Lathander , Waukeen , and Tempus .</p>
<p>He was a friend and ally to many other gods of craftsmanship and invention. He shared bonds with Cyrrollalee of the halfling pantheon , along with several of the Morndinsamman , including Dugmaren Brightmantle , Dumathoin , Vergadain , and even Moradin the All-Father. Gond shared an especially strong connection to the gnomish deity of smithing, Flandal Steelskin , who maintained a portal to Gond's divine realm.</p>
<p>Gond had one major foe among the Faerûnian deities, Talos the Destroyer. Talos' urge to demolish all devices of creation threatened the entirety of Gond's work in the Realms and beyond.</p>
<h3>Followers</h3>
<p>While Gond was wholly devoted to his mortal followers, he remained too busy at times to answer their prayers in a timely manner. While the Wonderbringer directed them to promote invention and new ideas, he was not opposed to his followers accumulating significant personal wealth in the process. To many this was seen as an appropriate means for Gondar priests to demonstrate their worthiness of his blessing.</p>
<p>At times, he would dispatch golems , lightning mephits , baku holy ones, einheriar , maruts , and even steel or crystal dragons to serve as guides to aid his devotees, or demonstrate his blessing to mortals.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Wonderbringer constantly worked on new inventions. Gond was credited in legends for the creation of a number of artifacts . These included the Shadowstar and the unbreakable leash that bound Kezef the Chaos Hound .</p>
<p>He often spent time sparking inspiration in his most devout followers, or offering them new insights for how existing technology could be otherwise utilized.</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Up until the late 14 th century DR , the primary center of Gond worship in the realms was the island nation of Lantan . The Lantanese brought their worship of Gond to the Sword Coast of Faerûn via Waterdeep . The inventions of the Gondar clergy greatly contributed to the ascendance of Waterdhavian mercantilism. Similarly, their influence in Baldur's Gate was evident in civic projects led by Gond's church and the wholesale incorporation of their devices into Baldurian daily life.</p>
<p>The faith of Gond spread far and wide beyond the Sword Coast, to inland cities such as Tilverton in Cormyr , Essembra in the Dalelands , and Ravens Bluff in Vesperin . Gond's religion could even be found in the far off Unapproachable East , in the magocratic realm of Thay , and among a community of gnomes that dwelled within a solitary isle within the Yal Tengri sea.</p>
<p>Gond was accepted among the gnomish pantheon as Nebelun the Meddler, though a few small groups believed that Nebelun was a separate deity. Though the latter was correct, Nebelun was only active in other crystal spheres , leaving the Faerûnian Lord of All Smiths free to take his place in the Realms.</p>
<h3>Notable Worshipers</h3>
<h3>Temples</h3>
<p>Main article: Category:Temples to Gond Gond had various temples throughout Faerûn, such as the grand High House of Wonders in Baldur's Gate. Many temples to Gond were not just ordinary places of worship, but within, machines such as internal combustion engines were displayed, and vehicles such as gondrollers were sold.</p>
<p>Notable temples to Gond included:</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Worship of Gond as Zionel―among practitioners of the Adama ―emerged several years pre- Dalereckoning , in the Year of Able Warriors, −256 DR .</p>
<p>During the Time of Troubles , in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , the gods of the Faerûnian pantheon were cast down to the mortal realms of Toril by the Overgod Ao . Gond's avatar took the form of a gnome who washed up on the shores of Lantan in the Trackless Sea . His divinity was quickly recognized by the Lantanna people and Gond was revered for the duration his avatar remained in the Realms.</p>
<p>In recognition and gratitude for their supplication, Gond bestowed upon the people of Lantan the secret for making smokepowder . This allowed the Lantanna to rapidly begin formulation of firearms, which were continually shipped off to purchasers across the western coast of Faerûn. While worship of Gond grew swiftly in the years that followed, the introduction of these new weapons was viewed as a foreboding change in warfare by leads from across Faerûn.</p>
<p>A mere decade later, in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Gond was commissioned by the recently-arisen god Cyric to commission powerful suits of armor to carry out his own schemes. Cyric armed his inquisitors with these horrific weapons of war and initiated the Second Banedeath in cities across the Heartlands .</p>
