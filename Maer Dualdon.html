<p>Maer Dualdon ( pronounced : / m ɛər d juː ˈ ɔː l d ʌ n / mair dew-AWL-dun ) was a cold lake in Icewind Dale . It was the largest of the three in the region, with deep azure waters.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It was in the northwest region of the Ten Towns , on the far end of Kelvin's Cairn .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>The lake was a major source of knucklehead trout , whose bones were used in the art of scrimshaw . It was also home to families of curious otters . The bottom and shores of the lake had many broken parts of ships that perished in storms that were common in the area.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Maer Dualdon was once the main objective for everyone that made the trek to Icewind Dale.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>The towns of Bremen , Targos , Termalaine , and Lonelywood were situated on its silvery banks. Boats from these towns regularly skilled the lakes surfacing, competing with one another for the daily catch.</p>
<p>Circa 1269 DR the Accursed Tower of Damien Morienus , a former master of the Host Tower of the Arcane , stood on the western bank of the lake across from Lonelywood . It disappeared during the event called the Great Thaw , later in 1369 DR the tower was discovered by a group of adventurers, sunken deep into the ground, still accessible via the circle of stones on Maer Dualdon's bank (actually the top part of one of the tower's spires).</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>A traveling wizard , who passed Bryn Shander in 1281 DR , claimed that Maer Dualdon's waters were warm because of a pit to Hells under its lakebed. The wizard also claimed that one day Maer Dualdon would turn into a lake of fire.</p>
