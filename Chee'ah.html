<p>Chee'ah was a demigoddess worshiped by the saru of the Malatran Plateau , considered by them to be their matron mother and teacher.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Chee'ah held concern for the well-being of the jungles of the Plateau in general. Unlike most deities, she cared not for physical symbols of power or influence, such as temples. Though despite this, she often visited a temple that was maintained by her shamans .</p>
<h2>Realm</h2>
<p>Chee'ah made her home on the Prime Material . She roamed the jungles of the Malatran Plateau, watching over the saru that inhabited it, but was said to primarily inhabit an area called Baneratha-shi-gurtha .</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>The priesthood of Chee'ah was small in number and made up entirely of saru women. Whenever a saru woman felt the "calling," as they put it, she would leave her clan and seek out their deity. It was said that those who managed to find Chee'ah would return to their clan, having been bestowed clerical powers, though very few ever actually saw her in person. Shamans of Chee'ah also became rather reclusive and private individuals.</p>
<p>Those who did see Chee'ah in person could become "Touched", a state that attracted hundreds of nature spirits to them. The spirits would clamor around the shaman, demanding attention and offering all kinds of boons for a period averaging around two to eight days, and those who didn't know how to handle this clamor would eventually go mad. Additionally, being visited by the goddess was sometimes considered an omen that a great sacrifice was to be needed.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Outside of the saru, Chee'ah was little known of by the other races that inhabited the Malatran Plateau. One exception to this were the jungle giants of Hafoka , who claim that the founders of their village made peace with She-Who-Walks.</p>
