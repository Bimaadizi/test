<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ivrin was a tall, aging human male with a gaunt complexion. He often felt aches in his old bones and was seen leaning heavily on his trusted staff .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the Wild Pastures west of Liam's Hold hamlet began experiencing uncanny disappearances of cattle, sometimes in the middle of the day. On one particularly rainy day, Ivrin the Shepherd witnessed one of his favorite cows , Betty , disappear. Before the bovine "went poof," as the shepherd described it, Ivrin heard strange giggling. The cattle disappearances alarmed the inhabitants of Liam's Hold and reached the worried ears of Daggerford 's guard. The city asked the adventurer lair known as the Hero of Daggerford to investigate. Ivrin was one of the shepherds the adventurer interviews as a part of his investigation. The disappearances were revealed to be a band of goblins armed with a magic brew who served the devil Gorgomorz . Betty, however, could not be rescued from her dire fate.</p>
