<p>A robe of the archmagi was a rare and powerful robe worn only by the most powerful spellcasters.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These magnificent and elegant robes were often made out of the most expensive cloth of white, gray, or black color and decorated with silvery magical runes. Typically, the robes were created in colors corresponding to the alignment of the wearer: white was usually made for good magic users, gray for neutral , and black for evil . It was impossible to attune to a robe of the archmagi of the wrong alignment.</p>
<p>It was believed by some that black robes of the archmagi could be "redeemed" into a set of white robes, by means of powerful magic and significant wealth.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The robe of the archmagi provided its wearer with magical and physical defenses, as well as improving the user's magical prowess.</p>
<p>Pre- Spellplague , it was common for these items to severely weaken the wearer if they attempted to wear a mismatched-alignment robe, for as long as they wore it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The neutral, gray robes of the archmagi were said to have originated from the Ulcaster School of Wizardry .</p>
<p>Black robes of the archmagi were crafted in significant numbers by the Zhentarim of the 14 th century DR .</p>
