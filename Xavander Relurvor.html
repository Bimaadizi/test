<p>Xavander Relurvor , also known as Xavander the Great , was the wizard who founded the realm of the Mount in the Year of the Fallen Throne, 1319 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Xavander discovered the Mount during the Year of the Fallen Throne, 1319 DR , while looking for a place to hide with his family after his brother Ormalin embezzled a large portion of Ravens Bluff 's treasury. After settling in, he used the volcano to melt the treasure, minting counterfeit Amnian and Calishite coins with the resulting metals. Various family members faked their death and moved to the Mount, and after some internal strife Ormalin fell into a lava rift and Xavander established his kingdom.</p>
<p>Once his realm established, Xavander rented territory to Ravenaar individuals who could afford it. Those "Tombs" were officially sold as a place for their loved ones to rest, but were actually used as a hiding places where the "Tomb Holders" hid stolen goods, kidnapped rivals, or allies trying to lay low for a while. When Xavander was killed by a more powerful wizard, his son Tholander took over.</p>
