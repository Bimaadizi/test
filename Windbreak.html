<p>The Windbreak was a massive rock that towered over the remote northern coastline of Icewind Dale on the Sea of Moving Ice .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The rock was tall and blade-like in shape. It sat atop cliffs overlooking the Sea of Moving Ice, and rose over 140 feet (43 meters) above these already 160‑foot (49‑meter) cliffs.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , the high-security prison of Revel's End was carved out of the rock's northwest side. The rock earned its name because of its role in shielding the prison from the harsh winds coming off the Reghed Glacier .</p>
