<p>Chical was the old leader of the Eagle Knights of Nexal .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1361 DR , Chical tried to convince Poshtli , a fellow Eagle Knight and nephew of Naltecona , to abandon his fellows Halloran and Erixitl to their fates.</p>
<p>Later, alongside the Jaguar Knight Kalnak , Chical was chosen by Naltecona to lead an ambush against the Golden Legion at Palul , despite Chical's objection that this was not an honorable plan.</p>
<p>Together, Chical and Kalnak welcomed the strangers while secretly their elite army waited in hiding. However, the mage Darien discovered the plan thanks to her magic and informed Cordell , who was at Kalnak's side. Quickly, Cordell surprised and killed Kalnak.</p>
<p>Chical, however, survived the defeat and quickly went back to Nexal in eagle form to report the failure to Naltecona. After this defeat, the Nexalan ruler changed his mind and proclaimed the strangers as gods, ordering Chical to dismiss the army.</p>
<p>When Naltecona was imprisoned by the legionaries, Chical tried to lead a platoon to liberate him but was dismissed by Naltecona himself.</p>
<p>Later, he appealed to Poshti, by then the regent, to try again but with no success.</p>
<p>During the Night of Wailing , he discussed with Hoxitl their battle plan to slay all the strangers.</p>
<p>He survived the transformation of the Viperhands into monsters and became the unofficial leader of the Nexalan survivors.</p>
