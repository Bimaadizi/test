<p>Three Flags Sailing was a tavern in the town of Targos in Icewind Dale in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It stood near the docks, at the center of town.</p>
<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
<p>It was a quiet, relaxed sort of place, catering as it did to fisherfolk after a long hard day's work, who wanted only dinner and a drink before heading home, not talk and revelry. It was especially subdued during Auril 's unending winter in 1488 DR and 1489 DR . Nevertheless, when they celebrated an especially good catch or had had a clash with their rivals from Termalaine or told the story of a past one, the atmosphere could become more boisterous.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>It typically served a bowl of stew and a pint of beer .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In the 1480s DR, "Ma" Ethen Yarbroul ran the tavern like an old mother, fussing over the fisherfolk patrons as if they were own sons (and some were) and encouraging them to have a hot beer "to take the chill off".</p>
