<p>Ghuldribrand Mroster was the Mage Royal of Zindalankh in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Arch, 1353 DR , Ghuldribrand provided a number of quotes on the Border Kingdoms to Volothamp Geddarm . Though there was some macabre reminiscing about Manywaters , extended grumbling on Ondeeme , Middle Mukshar , Nether Mukshar and the Neth Stand , and cryptic warnings about Oeble and Myrinjar , Ghuldribrand was most effusive on Owlhold , praising the fighters there and their potential, albeit making a jab at their roads.</p>
<p>During the same conversation, Ghuldribrand implied having slain a number of sorceresses, the first of them in Manywaters.</p>
