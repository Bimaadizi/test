<p>Tabotan was a language spoken by the Tabotan people of Tabot in Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>There was a common Tabotan tongue that held the nation together, but local accents were thick.</p>
<h2>Learning</h2>
<p>Tabotan was quite a simple language and the common form was easily learned, but few outsiders knew it, and few Tabotans knew the Trade Tongue , only their native tongue. Fortunately, most cities and villages, especially those near the borders and along trade routes, had interpreters available. This in turn gave outsiders few incentives to learn Tabotan themselves. Interpreters could be hired for between 10 and 30 yuan a day. They were fewer in the smaller towns, and hence their prices were higher.</p>
