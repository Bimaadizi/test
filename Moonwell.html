<p>A moonwell was a magical pool of water in the Moonshae Isles that was sacred to the Earthmother and her druids . They were said to be a connection between the Earthmother's "body"—the land of the Moonshaes—and her " spirit ".</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Moonwells in their natural state were filled with fresh and unspoiled spring water, and served as a source of clean water for the flora and fauna around them. This water was still and very nearly clear, but gained a subtle white hue in the presence of moonlight , spells , or spellcasters . They sometimes produced their own while or silvery-blue light (which was most visible at night), and this radiance appeared whenever they became a focus of magic. Being near a moonwell gave the sense of being in the presence of sacred power.</p>
<p>Moonwells could generally be found in sacred groves at various locations across the Moonshaes—known as Great Groves —which were always deep within a wild forest. They were often surrounded by circles of standing stones or squared arches. They were protected, tended, and kept clean by druids, and under normal circumstances, only these druids were allowed to touch the moonwell. It was illegal in the lands of the Ffolk to befoul a moonwell, including by throwing stones or fishing. If abandoned by its druid tenders, a moonwell lost its light and power. It might then become a mundane well, dry up completely, or turn green and stagnant.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The moonwells' magic was widely suspected, but few save the druids knew their true secrets. They were the source of might of the druids of the Moonshae Isles, and provided a direct conduit to the Earthmother. They served as the Earthmother's window into the Material Plane through which she was able to monitor the isles, to communicate with her druids, and to manifest her power.</p>
<p>The pure waters of a moonwell were generally rejuvenating if drank through cupped hands, although they could be harmful to those who had recently threatened or violently disrespected the balance of nature. Coming into contact with the waters could neutralize poison and cure disease , including infectious cases of lycanthropy . Under a full moon, the waters were said to have broader restorative powers . The animals of the Moonshaes were known to seek out moonwells when injured or sick, and drinking the waters would either heal their ailments or grant them a peaceful death, causing them to be absorbed into the pool. Under normal circumstances, any creature that died within a moonwell was completely and cleanly dissolved into the waters.</p>
<p>Moonwell waters could also be used to empower magic items , such as to craft a druid's cudgel or sentinel's cudgel , or to recharge weapons, such as a druid staff . To recharge magic items, a druid had to dip the object into a moonwell at midnight beneath a full moon while casting shillelagh . Any metal object or item placed within a moonwell, including coins and magic items, often instantly began to corrode unless protected by a spell such as shillelagh .</p>
<p>Druids or clerics of Chauntea could use moonwells to enhance their spellcasting. They gained a number of new powers while within a Great Grove empowered by a moonwell, and could confer spell immunity upon anyone in contact with a moonwell. The reflecting pool spell was more powerful when cast upon a moonwell, and on nights when the moon was full, druid circles could use a moonwell to ritually cast commune and scrying . Moonwells could also serve as portals to the Feywild and it was believed that they could be made to serve as portals between each other.</p>
<p>Moonwells would lose their magic if they were abandoned or fell into disrepair, which would also weaken the Earthmother's ability to act through them. The waters of a moonwell swiftly lost their magic if placed into a container or otherwise removed from a moonwell.</p>
<h3>Darkwells</h3>
<p>If corrupted by dark magic or filled with corpses, a moonwell would become a darkwell , which could be used to summon or create evil creatures, act as a portal to other planes , or even to inflict harm upon the Earthmother herself. The waters of a darkwell were poisonous .</p>
<p>Creating a darkwell involved a ritual designed to befoul the waters of the moonwell. It generally involved sacrificing living victims within a moonwell, and usually required a large variety of creatures to be slain, including at least two members from among the Moonsahe's native dwarves , halflings , or Llewyrr elves . These sacrifices all had to be killed within one day of either a full or new moon, and were accompanied by a ritual in which the Earthmother was reviled by someone while in contact with the moonwell's waters.</p>
<p>A moonwell could alternatively be "veiled" with the moonveil spell, a dark ritual devised by priests of Bane which suppressed and befouled a moonwell in order to deprive the Earthmother of power and influence. It was only possible to purify a veiled moonwell by casting sanctify sacred site .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Moonwells were always tended and defended by at least two druid guardians led by a powerful third druid known as a Steward of the Grove . These druids took their duties seriously enough that they would sacrifice their lives to protect the pools' sanctity. They were particularly cautious about allowing lycanthropes near to a moonwell, and only did so if they were seeking to be cured and had surrendered any weapons and expended any spells.</p>
<p>Some moonwells were also protected by the ancient trilithons erected in a circle around them. Known only to the highest-ranking druids, these stones were often intelligent and observant, and were rumored to be able to move and crush intruders who threatened the moonwell.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Moonwells were long thought to have been gifts from the Earthmother, and so her worshipers had always kept vigil over them and had erected circles of standing stones around them in ancient times. The Ffolk considered it taboo to interfere in the activities at a Great Grove.</p>
<p>At some point, Mystra imbued a portion of her power into the moonwells to turn them into Weave anchors .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Saddle, 1345 DR , firbolgs polluted a moonwell to allow the Beast, Kazgoroth , to enter the world. The Beast was killed by Tristan Kendrick with the Sword of Cymrych Hugh , and the well was afterwards cleansed by the goddess.</p>
<p>Following this, the evil cleric Hobarth sought to corrupt the moonwell in Myrloch Vale . In the Year of the Bloodbird, 1346 DR , an army of undead captured the moonwell, and the Earthmother used her power to spray white water from the well to save her druids from death by turning them to stone. However, with twice-dead corpses dumped in it, the moonwell became so polluted that Bhaal was able to manifest through it, and used it to create perytons , an owlbear , and a displacer beast from the bodies of animals lured to the well. While Bhaal was ultimately defeated, this conflict left the Earthmother apparently dead, and her influence vanished from the Moonshae Isles.</p>
<p>Two decades later, a new moonwell appeared in Fairheight and the other moonwells began to revitalize, prompting many of the Earthmother's faithful to begin pilgrimages to them in the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR .</p>
<p>Beginning in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , druid wardens of the moonwells' sacred groves began to feel a calling to enter the moonwells, and vanished upon doing so. Unknown to the wider world, these druids were being whisked away to the Feywild, and such a fate nearly befell the Great Druid Robyn Kendrick as well. By the next year , enough people had gone missing that pilgrimages began to diminish. At this point, Robyn and Tristan Kendrick entered a moonwell to investigate the disappearances.</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , a great number of fey began appearing out of the moonwells as they arrived from the Feywild. While occasionally mischievous, they largely kept to the depths of the Myrloch Vale and Winterglen forest. Their arrival heralded the return of Karador and the rebirth of the realm of Sarifal on Gwynneth in the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR .</p>
<p>In the century followed, it was believed that the Earthmother withdrew much of her power from the moonwells in order to prevent them from from being further abused. As of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the Black Blood tribe was attempting to pollute the moonwells on Moray in hopes of summoning Kazgoroth once more. Around the same time, a scribe named Heinrich Mucklepratt discovered a strange, bestial horn on Snowdown and was overcome with a desire to find a moonwell and toss the item into it. Meanwhile, an orc shaman named Crughth worked to taint the only moonwell on Oman's Isle in hopes of using it to transport his fomorian allies to other moonwells around the isles.</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , some worshipers of nature deities and wielders of primal magic had prophesized that heroes would one day restore the moonwells to their full power when there arose a need to defend the Moonshaes against an invasion from another world. At the same time, Zariel conspired to use a moonwell to return the spirit of the red dragon Skadaurak to the Material Plane in the body of a suitable host .</p>
<h2>Notable Moonwells</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, were twenty-six known moonwells scattered across the Moonshae Isles, the vast majority of which were concentrated on the Isle of Gwynneth (and particularly within the Myrloch Vale ). Each isle had a central moonwell that was particularly important, however moonwells on isles controlled by the Northmen tended to fall into disrepair without Ffolk druids to tend them. No moonwells remained on the island of Norland . The most notable moonwells included:</p>
<p>There also existed a dark moonwell within Creirwy Glade of the Shiverpine Forest in the Land Under Eternal Ice , the divine domain of the goddess Auril . This moonwell was associated with Auril and the Queen of Air and Darkness rather than with the Earthmother, and connected the domain to the Feywild.</p>
