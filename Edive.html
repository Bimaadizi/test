It lay close to the Amnurflow as it descended out of the mountains, and was one of the closest settlements to the remote fortresses of Citadel Amnur and Citadel Rashturl .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Edive folk performed lake fishing and farmed root vegetables, and sold the surplus to travelers and nearby military sites such as Citadel Amnur and Citadel Rashturl.</p>
