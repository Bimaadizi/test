<p>Val-Murthag , also written as Val Murthag , was a fortress-city that existed during ancient empire of Narfell , well over a thousand years before the Era of Upheaval . It served as a vital bulwark against the Raumathari empire to the east.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It was situated on the western border of the Great Dale , about two days' travel northeast of Bezentil .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>As of the late 14 th century, all that remained of Val-Murthag above ground were a series of collapsed stone walls. In the vaults deep below the surface however, remained ruined dungeons that still held imprisoned demons , ghostly remnants of Nar priests, as well as artifacts that had been stolen from the empire of Raumathar , and even the specifications of an unholy ritual that allowed for the transformation of humans into some manner of fiend .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Val-Murthag's castle served as the empire's profane center of worship, where they could freely call upon the demons of the Abyss .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Nar fortress was destroyed by Raumathari battle-magic in the Year of the Stone Giant, âˆ’160 DR , during the Great Conflagration , the last great war between the two ancient powers.</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the renegade Red Wizard Branimern Rythil and her imp familiar ventured into the ancient fortress with the aim of recovering some of its lost secrets.</p>
