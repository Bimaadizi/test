<p>Rooms at the Anchorage cost 14 sp per night per head, but that price included meals and stabling of a single beast. Any drink other than milk or mintwater cost extra, as did storing a wagon or stabling extra beasts.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Anchorage was staffed by four familes and plenty of children were around to help with chores and they were surprisingly well-behaved.</p>
