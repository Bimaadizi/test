<p>The ankh of life was a powerful artifact that was a holy symbol of the manifestation of Re .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The ankh was worn and covered with dirt. It was made from birch and measured 1 foot (30 centimeters) in length.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This artifact could use the following powers— resurrection twice per day, restoration three times per day, regenerate three times per day, destroy undead, 30' radius three times per day, and continual light at will. However, these great powers came with a steep cost. Using any of these powers, aside from continual light , permanently drained a portion of the wielder's experiences and memories. This was only restorable via a wish .</p>
