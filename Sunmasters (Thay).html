<p>The Sunmasters were an elite contingent within the Thayan military active during the late 15 th century DR . The group was mostly made up of Banite clerics and warlocks specializing in radiant magics .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Sunmasters were sworn to serve Thay, and were led by Corporal Isma Lecere . They were trained as an elite strike force specializing in dealing with Thay's Shadovar enemies during the Shadovarâ€“Thay War . As such, they rarely became involved in anything but the most important or the most desperate battles.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Sunmasters were assigned to Surcross , a well-defended town on Thay's western border. They had their own special chambers within the town's fortified garrison , which were unusually opulent and cushy. They had comfortable beds, thick carpets, luxurious clothes, and fine food and wine, even while much of the town starved during martial law.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Surcross came under attack by the flying Shadovar citadel of Kolthunral , resulting in a long and grueling battle. Even so, the Sunmasters remained largely aloof, only engaging in combat when circumstances called for their elite talents.</p>
