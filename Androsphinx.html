<p>Androsphinxes ( pronounced : /ˈ æ n d r oʊ s f ɪ ŋk s / ÆN-dro-sfinks listen ) were the males of the sphinx species.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>While they tended to be short-tempered and terse, androsphinxes possessed good-natured ideals and always attempted to do the right thing.</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>Androsphinxes were physically very powerful creatures and had terrifying, deafening roars that could be heard from miles away that could inspire fear in other creatures to such a point that they would become momentarily paralyzed. Those standing within 3 feet (0.91 meters) were liable to be deafened and even knocked over if small enough.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>These creatures had innate magical abilities, with some being capable of casting clerical spells .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>These creatures were typically capable of speaking both their own unique language and Common . Some were also known to speak Draconic</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Many andros shunned the company of their female counterparts, gynosphinxes , as they resented their greater intellects and neutral-dispositions.</p>
<p>Androsphinxes were favored monsters of the elven deities Aerdrie Faenya and Solonor Thelandira , the dwarven god Vergadain , the Mulhorandi god Horus-Re , and the god Nobanion . They would sometimes send them as messengers to their followers.</p>
