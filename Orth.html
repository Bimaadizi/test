<p>In 1369 DR , the Simbul assaulted a temple of Shar somewhere in Thay where the Red Wizard Azmyrandyr was preparing for an intrigue. Her goal was a revenge attack after Azmyrandyr participated in an attack on Silverymoon . During her attack, Azmyrandyr and his apprentices were rehearsing the impersonation of several notables from Nimpeth ; Orth himself was practicing his impersonation of a sailor of no renown.</p>
<p>One of her first attacks was to strike him with magic missiles ; he responded with some of his own, but did no more beyond that.</p>
