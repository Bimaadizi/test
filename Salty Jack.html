<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Salty Jack could be found on Westgate's Harbor Loop , begging for coin and offering advice in exchange. In his mad state, he thought the city of Westgate to be his ship, a fine vessel, and its inhabitants – the ship's crew. He regularly would scream in terror, claiming that the ship sprang a leak. Salty Jack told newcomers that not all crew members were upstanding citizens. Despite this, Jack could offer some insight, like where the local gang could be found, the Ebon Claws , whom he called rats , and pointed to wards their lair in the sewers that smelled of rats and poop, "Poop in the Loop," as he produly rhymed.</p>
