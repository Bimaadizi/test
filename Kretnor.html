<p>Kretnor was the shaman and healer of the Golden Mane wemic pride that roamed across the Shaar during the 14 th century DR . A devour follower, she led the worship of Nobanion within the tribe, particularly on holy days and organized offerings to the King of Beasts.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was a particularly beautiful lioness, with striking red hair and a number of tattoos of beasts on her arms and face.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Kretnor was a skilled healer, and spent much of her time crafting restorative items such as potions of healing , unguents, and salves .</p>
<p>Every once in a while, to keep her skill and prove her abilities to herself and the rest of her pride, Kretnor would escape for a couple days to hunt on her own. She would usually return with a large, and often dangerous, quarry. Kretnor looked forward to when she could transform into the shape of other animals.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>In addition to the worship and healing services she provided to the pride, Kretnor was a spiritual advisor, particularly to their leader Shaq'ar . While Kretnor was greatly appreciated for all she did for her kin, the fact that Shaq'ar only used her abilities as a healer during combat or hunts left her feeling restricted and unappreciated.</p>
<p>She was greatly aided by her hawk companion Silvin , who acted as a scout for both Kretnor and the Golden Manes.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Among Kretnor's possessions were a ring of animal friendship and a clear spindle ioun stone .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kretnor had borne three cubs in her life, all males who would go on to lead prides of their own.</p>
<p>Upon his return to the pride, the dark wemic Beren began courting Kretnor, which continued on for some time. While she appreciated his interest, her intuition about his true nature told her not to give in to his advances.</p>
