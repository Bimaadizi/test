<p>The Chantry of St. Sammaster was a cult compound created by the Cult of the Dragon with the help of the Church of Velsharoon in the Vale of the Dragon Oracle in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Chantry of St. Sammaster was built opposite the collapsed Temple of the Dragon Oracle in a valley within the Thunder Peaks .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The chantry was quarried into a cliff, being dug into the stone for space.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The walls were the native igneous stone, which had been cleared away with magic but carved entirely by hand to show proper reverence and humility of spirit. As a result, the carvings weren't finished by 1370 DR and there was still some amount of fine rubble that hadn't been cleared from the carving. The entrance was wide enough to admit six people walking comfortably abreast, but most of the hallways were around 10 feet (3 meters) wide.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>Torches were ensconced every 20 feet (6.1 meters) on alternating sides of the hallways.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The chantry, though unfinished, had a laboratory; a room that was used to rebuild the skeleton of Aghazstamn ; two libraries, one for arcane studies and one for writings sacred to the Church of Velsharoon; and a training room, as well as many amenities and suites both for a High Necrophant and a Wearer of Purple .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The Chantry had a guard post and extensive staff, many of which possessed training in magic or swordplay: there were about twenty-six soldiers and four mages under normal conditions, plus six clerics of Velsharoon .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Chantry of St. Sammaster was built by the Church of Velsharoon that joined the Cult of the Dragon's forces after they returned to the Vale of the Dragon Oracle in the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , starting construction in Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR . By the next year , the building was completed. The leading Wearer of Purple, Maezra, then left the valley with half the forces of the Temple to try and woo Nevalarich into joining the Cult and perhaps undergoing conversion into a dracolich , leaving Saerin Fierne , her second-in-command, in charge. During her absence, Zhentarim forces led by the mage Ardalis attacked the compound under the orders of Lychor .</p>
