<p>Giant-killers , otherwise known as giant slayers , were adventurers who devoted their lives to hunting and killing giants and giant-kin , usually driven by a need to avenge some past deed committed by one. Elves and dwarves were the most common races to take up this way of life.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Giant-killers were known to be very agile fighters, skilled in targeting the weak points of their foes. Due to their narrow obsession with giants, they tended to be very knowledgeable about how to track down or sneak up on them, but also how to tailor their attacks to whichever race of giant they were facing. These tactics were also applicable to ogres and trolls .</p>
<p>Many of the tactics that giant-killers in Faerun utilized were developed by shield dwarfs . On the isle of Oman , giant-killers utilized techniques that were developed by Northlanders .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Giant-killers were known to often wear over-sized armor. Many sought out magical girdles and gauntlets of strength , inspired by old legends. They typically utilized two-handed weapons, such as bastard swords and battleaxes , as well as hurled weapons. Bows , crossbows , and slings were viewed by some as being weapons fit for only cowards. Some were known to decorate their shields with ribbons and medals awarded to them by grateful communities.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Giant-killers generally traveled alone or in small groups.</p>
<p>Some good-aligned giant killers were known to linger on killing good-aligned giants, waiting until they did something that would warrant their death. However, understandably all giants regardless of their alignment detested giant killers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Many giant-killers arose and flocked across Faerun to the Evermoors in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , when giants began to invade the region and displaced its troll population into the Silver Marches . Around this time they were considered an invaluable asset in the region's outskirts, especially in the city of Nesm√© . However, some were more driven by greed than an obsession to slay giants and would refuse to lend their services for low rewards.</p>
<p>Around this same time, the dwarven settlements of Citadel Felbarr and Mithral Hall were known to have warriors skilled in the art of giant killing, though those of the former rarely lent their services out to any other settlement.</p>

<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Giant-killers were equally as likely to receive adoration as they were to be targeted by local bullies and tough guys for harassment or to be considered a blowhard. This was due to them presenting themselves so aggressively, often having big egos, and frequently boasting of their latest triumphs.</p>
