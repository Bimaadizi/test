<h2>History</h2>
<p>An orphan from the Vilhon Reach , she was kept as a slave in a kitchen in Calimshan . One day, she stole a spellbook from the rich bedchambers of the house, and began to practice magic with it. When the book's theft was discovered, she kept her actions a secret.</p>
<p>When Azuth offered her the office of the Magister, she accepted, as the god had walked through the rest of the house, effectively revealing his business with her and thus putting her life in danger. She was soon after attacked by volleys of mages intent on claiming the mantle of the Magister , and survived despite fumbling many of her spells only because of the covert aid of Loaradden Derviir ; aware of some force helping her, she became emboldened, and began attacking mages before they attacked her. After she had slain most of Loaradden Derviir's rivals, she found herself attacked and soon slain by him.</p>
<p>She lived on in Mystra 's service, participating in spellbattles.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Though she was aware that someone aided her, Iolaeden believed it was the goddess Mystra or Azuth that protected her in spell battles.</p>
<p>Mystra may have had plans for Iolaeden, kept secret even from her, as of the late 14 th century DR .</p>
