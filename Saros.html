<p>Saros was the Lord of Turmish who rose to power in 992 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Watching Helm, 992 DR , the Merchant Princes lost control of Turmish. An ambitious warlord and charismatic leader, Lord Saros, convinced the military forces of Turmish to support him as a potential ruler of the nation. Lord Saros proclaimed that the leadership of Turmish needed to be in the hands of the man who "knows what this country needs." Lord Saros, of course, became that man and took the throne. Under his leadership, Turmish rapidly became a naval force to be reckoned with. He sponsored construction of ports in the Free Cities of the Vilhon Reach , namely in Hlath and Reth , and forged an alliance with the city of Hlondeth .</p>
<p>Lord Saros' legacy was Turmish becoming the guardian of the Vilhon's waterways and gaining security that allowed it to flourish. By the Year of the Scourge, 1150 DR , Turmish's population grew more than twice its size.</p>
