<table border='1'><tr><th>Type</th><td>Clothing</td></tr></table><br>
<p>Clouts were undergaments worn by most folks of the Realms . They were made of a tight belt worn around the hips, and of a long strip of cloth passed between the legs, slipped in the belt on the front and back of the body, and left to dangle.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The belt of the clouts could be manufactured from various different materials: the most durable were made of leather , but cheaper alternatives could be made of cloth or even cord. They were usually closed on the front using small hooks.</p>
<p>The strip of cloth passed between the legs was made of fabric, usually cotton . The dangling ends were often designed to be tied together, and was folded on itself by horse riders to provide additional padding and absorbancy.</p>
<p>While most clouts were basic undergarments, some were decorative, made "to be seen", or even sold freshly- perfumed . Such novelty items could be found in big cities such as Waterdeep .</p>
