<p>Goblin Hunter was a unique enchanted dagger designed specifically for hunting goblins of Icewind Dale , created by Elytharra Dinnesmore of Targos .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Goblin Hunter had a delicate pearl handle, and its blade looked more like a hunting knife than a weapon.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The blade's enchantments were especially dangerous to goblins as its edge cut deeper into the creatures' hides. Functionally, the dagger became a +2 enchanted weapon when wielded against goblins.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Goblin Hunter was created sometime before the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , by the enchantress Elytharra Dinnesmore, the wife of Ulbrec Dinnesmore , the speaker of Targos at the time. She created the magic blade as a way to defend herself from goblin raids that menaced the settlements of Icewind Dale . When asked about Goblin Hunter , Elytharra claimed that the weapon was used only a handful of times. As of 1312 DR, the enchantress was willing to part with Goblin Hunter for the right price.</p>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Elytharra's Goblin Hunter belonged to Graendel Granitefist of Graendel's Fine Dwarven Craft in Targos and was available for sale.</p>
