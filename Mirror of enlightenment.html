<p>Mirrors of enlightenment were a variety of enchanted mirror from the land of Kara-Tur that allowed one to discern the inner nature of other creatures.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These mirrors were round in shape and had a rather ordinary appearance.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Whenever the command word of a mirror of enlightenment was spoken, the reflection of a creature in front of it would become surrounded by a colored aura. This aura was only visible to the one who spoke the command word and it revealed the nature of the reflected creature. This effect was similar to the spells detect evil , detect good , detect motivation , and know alignment .</p>
<p>Only one creature could be reflected and studied within the mirror per minute.</p>
