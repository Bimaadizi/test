<p>Duirtanal was a small town located in the middle of Semphar .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This small town appeared sad and ugly. It sat along the banks of a small river that ran with foul, stinking water. A brown pall hung over the town, accompanied by an offensive odor.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Duirtanal produced the finest leather to be found in all of Semphar, and much of the surrounding regions. Leather produced in Duirtanal, called Duir leather , was stronger and more flexible than leather found anywhere else. The secret to Duirtanal's tanning process was fiercely guarded by the guild masters.</p>
<p>Most families in the town produced items from leather, adding their own unique designs and colors that varied from family to family.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Duirtanal's Leather Market was the lifeblood of the town, driving prices and competition set by the Tanner's Guild on a daily basis.</p>
