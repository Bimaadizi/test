<p>Malaug , born Maulagadorn , was a human male warrior turned wizard who was the ancestor of the malaugryms . He was supposedly the first human to set foot in the Plane of Shadow .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the early days of the North , Maulaugadorn was a great warrior who created for himself a kingdom there, worshiping Tempus . One day, his sister Alandalorne was caught by a strange illness. Maulaugadorn invoked his god and Tempus explained that his sister was a sorcerer and her powers were starting to reveal. Thus, Maulaugadorn wanted to learn magic , because in his mind he saw it as a new kind of weapon. At last, Mystra revealed to him a path to become a mage.</p>
<p>In time, he became a great wizard and managed to enter the Plane of Shadow , where he gained great mastery over shadow magic but, at the same time, become an inhuman abomination: a proto-malaugrym.</p>
<p>During his exploration of the Plane of the Shadow, he built the Castle of Shadows .</p>
<p>Later, Malaug started wandering the planes , and with his new powers he impersonated many beings. His offspring were the first generation of the malaugrym, whom he supposedly sired with a "mother" who was a "strange being" from the Far Realm .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Flaming Forests, 224 DR , Malaug was inhabiting an identity called Undarl Dragonrider and killed Elthryn Aumar , the father of Elminster . He went on to become a powerful magelord of Athalantar before being defeated by Elminster in the Year of the Chosen, 240 DR . While he was whisked away by contingency magics, he nearly revealed his true form to Elminster, but managed to disguise his mishap with the appearance of a yuan-ti . It was unclear whether he survived the encounter, but regardless he was never seen again.</p>
