<p>Viekang was one of the children spawned by the deity Bhaal , in the years before the Avatar Crisis .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>For most of his life he was quite a fearful individual.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Viekang had a unique ability – whenever he felt great fear, he teleported to a different location on Toril .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Viekang was known to have spent some time in the town of Trademeet , when it was under assault from wild animals under the command of malevolent druids .</p>
<p>During the conflict of the Bhaalspawn , in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Viekang was hunted by a number of his half–siblings, most notably the fire giant Yaga-Shura .</p>
<p>When he was in the city of Saradush he encountered Melissan , an individual dedicated to helping all of the Bhaalspawn. She "cured" him of his randomized teleportation ability.</p>
<p>On Returning Day , in the Year of the Narthex Murders, 1482 DR , Viekang interrupted Grand Duke Abdel Adrian when he was addressing the Baldurian citizens within the marketplace of Baldur's Gate . He and his allies assaulted the Grand Duke and a chaotic fight broke out.</p>
<p>It was unknown which of the two men died in the battle, but it was clear that the victor transformed into the Slayer . The monstrous creature was subsequently defeated by the combined efforts of the Watch and band of visiting adventurers . Unbeknownst to all, the death of the final two Bhaalspawn and Bhaal's avatar resulted in the god of murder's return to the Faerûnian pantheon .</p>
