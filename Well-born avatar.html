<p>Well-born avatars were creatures born of the Traitor 's dreams while he was imprisoned beneath the Throat at Stardeep .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>While initially dark gray ropy masses that crawled like slugs, the well-born avatars of 1375 DR eventually converged on a silvery hue, broken only by ebon spiked tentacles, nacreous plates, and sometimes green jaws, depending on their present process of evolution. The creatures were overall quite stringy and sleek, roughly man-sized.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The abilities of well-born avatars were in constant flux: the creatures' flesh continually reconfigured in order to achieve their goals. They pulled in mass from dust particles in the air, and energy from the ambient magic, perhaps even the wards meant to contain them.</p>
<p>The Well-born avatar generated during the clash between the Empyrean Knights and Kiril Duskmourn developed ebon-tipped tentacles for a better grip on the wall, one of which fired a cloudy green beam which partly cancelled Delphe 's spellscythe ; the beam was possibly a variation on dimensional anchor . With its mouth, it attempted to call upon a pact, probably of a magical nature; it also let out a scream that caused frost across the room.</p>
<p>The Well-born avatar generated during Telarian's attempted breach also employed ebon-tipped tendrils, but the cloudy green beam they fired was aimed at Delphe rather than at the blade, making it more likely to be an offensive spell. Its blood was also as a dangerous acid, and it swelled more after every spell attack it took.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Well-born avatars had been observed by 1375 DR , a year in which there were at least two occurrences of well-born avatars spawning after Midwinter . One of them happened during the skirmish between the Empyrean Knights and Kiril Duskmourn , while another happened during Telarian 's attempt at breaking the Traitor free. Raidon Kane helped Delphe defeat that last one, but its plan appeared to be to keep Telarian's path to the Traitor free.</p>
