<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was the son of Dediana Extaminos , ruler of Hlondeth. He was also courting Glisena Foesmasher , the daughter of Baron Thuragar Foesmasher of Sespech, making the relationship between Hlondeth and Sespech somewhat tense, as neither Glisena nor Thuragar were interested, but dared not offend Hlondeth, so they did not completely rebuff his advances.</p>
