<p>The Rod of Law was a powerful artifact of lawful nature, which was created by the vaati during the Dawn War . It was split during the war, which gave it the nickname of Rod of Seven Parts .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The complete rod was 5 feet (1.5 meters) long rod whose width decreased from 2 inches (5.1 centimeters) across at the bottom, to a half-inch (1 centimeter) at the top. Due to their lawful nature, the fragments did not appear damaged but instead displayed intricate patterns of crystalline facets on each breaking point. The length of the fragments were 4 inches (10 centimeters), 5 inches (13 centimeters), 6 inches (15 centimeters), 8 inches (20 centimeters), 10 inches (25 centimeters), 12 inches (30 centimeters), and 15 inches (38 centimeters).</p>
<p>The rod was unstable, and once it served its purpose it was known to scatter again.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Each fragment of the rod shared a common set of powers, in addition to having individual powers. In order to activate a segment's power, the user had to focus on a fragment-specific command word.</p>
<p>Restored to its complete form, the rod held the power to kill Miska the Wolf-Spider or to release it from its prison.</p>
<h3>Specific fragment powers</h3>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Rod of Law was forged by the Wind Dukes of Aaqa using the Soulforge of Moradin in Torzak-Belgirn .</p>
<p>It was used during the battle of the Fields of Pesh in order to banish Miska the Wolf-Spider to a prison in Pandemonium . When Miska was stabbed with the rod, the chaos from its blood shattered the rod into seven pieces and scattered them across the multiverse .</p>
<p>Fragments of the rod would sometime surface here and there, often in times of great need. Among the aarakocra , questing for these fragments was commonly seen as an honorable calling worthy of esteem.</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>According to Khelben Arunsun , the rod of seven parts was one of the few magic items in the multiverse to have the abilities of series magic .</p>
<p>The activation words make up the latin phrase "Ruat Caelum, Fiat Justitia. Ecce Lex, Rex", which translates to "Though heaven falls, let justice be done. Behold, the law is king."</p>
