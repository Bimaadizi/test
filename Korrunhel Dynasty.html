<p>The Korrunhel family was a noble house of Tethyr that held the throne under the Shoon Imperium , becoming the third of the Shoon Traitorum dynasties.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Korrunhels became royalty through the actions of their founder, Matamid Korrunhel . Matamid served the previous king, Emyr Cormal , as his vizier and regent due to his young age. King Emyr eventually came of age and ruled for a time, but failed to produce an heir before his early death. The throne ultimately went to Matamid, whose dynasty ruled until the marriage of Queen Vajra with Karazir Tiiraklar , leading to the Tiiraklar Dynasty .</p>
