<p>Gwelt was a very ambitious arcanist of Thultanthar , and later, a member of " the Three ".</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Gwelt was ambitious, capable, and merciless.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As a trusted servant of High Prince Telamont Tanthul , Gwelt had been tasked with rooting out and destroying malcontents who threatened to rebel against the Princes of Shade . To achieve this, he created a fake resistance movement that could be used to attraxt such individuals.</p>
<p>In 1487 DR , Manarlume Tanthul and her sister Lelavdra Tanthul found that Gwelt was a highly dangerous individual who was plotting to kill all the Princes of Shade.</p>
<p>Later, Gwelt was summoned by the High Prince Telamont, who wanted to know him. Happy with Gwelt's reactions, the Most High showed Gwelt that the Wards of Candlekeep were gone and ordered him to investigate. Later, Telamont announced to Aglarel Tanthul that Gwelt would become his herald.</p>
<p>Thereafter, Gwelt led all the shadovar arcanists in working great mythal -draining magic. However, he abandoned the casting just before Larloch shattered the minds of all the collected arcanists. Gwelt went to Manarlume and Lelavdra to discuss how to survive the fighting.</p>
<p>Later, among the ruins of the collapsed Thultanthar , the three laughed about the stupidity of the High Prince.</p>
<p>After the fall, the three relocated to a magically concealed fortress in the ruins of the Citadel of the Raven , creating a society to rally survivors of Shade . Gwelt traveled often, doing most of the recruiting.</p>
<p>In 1491 DR he was sighted in Waterdeep , and may have had a relation to the murdered Masked Lord Ammasker Gwelt.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Gwelt was friends with fellow arcanist Relvrak , who was also his tutor for a time.</p>
