<h2>History</h2>
<p>One of House de La Sunya's shameful secrets was that of patriarch Don Di'Armos's affair with a woman during a particularly long and lonesome expedition. Unbeknownst to him at the time, this woman was a demon , and their tryst led to the birth of a tiefling child in far off Damara . When the woman later came to Don Di'Armos and revealed herself for who she truly was he slayed her, but he could not bring himself to do the same to their child. He left his daughter in the care of the monks of the Monastery of the Yellow Rose and kept this family secret up until his deathbed, sometime around the Year of Storms, 1310 DR . The revelation of this sordid episode in his father's life shook Sirge de La Sunya to his core so fundamentally, throwing into question all that he knew, that the boy denounced his house and fled from Athkatla, determined to find his sister.</p>
