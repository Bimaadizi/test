<p>Dark Maiden Wine was a variety of wine created by the dwarvish alesmith of Ravens Bluff named Bowser in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Bowser of Ravens Bluff attended the year-end celebration in the town of Mossbridges in the Vast . The alesmith took his first attempt at winemaking—Dark Maiden Wine—to the wine-tasting and grading competition. Even though the completion rules dictated Bowser could only bring one variety of wine, they said nothing about ale , so the dwarf brought all twelve types of ales of his making as well.</p>
