<p>Bloodsilk spiders were a magical species of spider .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These creatures had a bloated, red blister of flesh on their back and powerful legs. The average bloodsilk spider grew to be 3 feet (0.91 meters) in length and weighed around 30​ to ​40 pounds (14​ to ​18 kilograms).</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Bloodsilk spiders surprisingly possessed a cunning level of intelligence and could be very patient when hunting. They typically were neutrally -aligned, though those inhabiting areas tainted by malice could tend towards evil .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Eight times per day a bloodsilk spider could launch a sticky blood-red web out to a range of 50 feet (15 meters), which were their namesake. These webs were non-flammable and could uniquely be commanded by a bloodsilk spider to drill into ensnared prey, drain them of their blood, and then channel it into the spider itself to temporarily make it tougher. Though this had no effect on elementals or plant creatures .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Bloodsilk spiders typically hunted in groups of four to eight, lurking in foliage or rubble for prey to pass by, as individually they were not that powerful. When hunting alone, a bloodsilk spider would use hide-and-pounce tactics to surprise their prey. These creatures usually positioned their webs to ensnare flying prey, but sometimes they would try to trap ground prey.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>On average a bloodsilk spider nest would contain anywhere from eight to sixteen individuals. They lived and reproduced in a manner similar to most spiders. Whenever they exhausted the stock of prey within an area, they would move on to find a new home.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>These creatures inhabited the south reaches of Faerûn . Notably in the forests of Chondalwood , Lluirwood , and forests near the Shaar like Thornwood and Qurth Forest . They preferred areas of heavy foliage for their lair, though some would lair within ruins if a great number of their natural predators were in the area.</p>
<p>Bloodsilk spiders were also found in the Demonweb Pits , Lolth 's divine realm in the Abyss .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>These creatures often preyed upon by giant wasps and spider eaters . In Lluirwood, halfling druids and rangers occasionally banded together to destroy infestations of bloodsilk spiders.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Some rumors claimed that bloodsilk spiders originated from the curse that was placed upon the Qurth Forest.</p>
