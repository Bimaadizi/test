<p>Ulquar was a jackalwere priest of Malar in Undermountain in 1479 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1479 DR, Ulquar heard about a room sacred to Sel√ªne inside Undermountain where the lycanthropy curse was suppressed. Seeing this as an abomination, Ulquar went to take control of the place and re-educate in Malar's ways all the lycanthropes he found there.</p>
<p>Arriving in the room, posing as an elf cleric of Malar, he managed to convince two human werewolves , Josephus Blaze and Mizah Sheloran , to embrace their bestial side.</p>
