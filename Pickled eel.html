<p>Pickled eel was a fairly common food from the city-states of the Blade Kingdoms , owing to the abundant eel catch from the Akanamere .</p>
<h2>Availablity</h2>
<p>These pickled creatures were so common, and they could be found stocked up in the pantries of noble families, as well as the abode of the Prince-elect of Sumbria , the grand Palace of Manniccis .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Falling Moon, 1217 DR , Princess Milianna Mannicci da Sumbria was teaching herself the Art , in secrecy from the disapproving family using a copy of Lady Faveretti's Cookery Handbook for Erudite Young Girls (with an appendix on Poisoning for Beginners) . Guidenceless, the young woman's many spells misfired. One such mishandling of the arcane led to a summoning of a strange big green-furry-thing that promptly raided the palace's pantry, devouring all the picked eel, leaving gnawed leftovers scattered around the royal villa. The creature continued to plague the palace, becoming more of a vermin nuisance than a danger to its inhabitants.</p>
