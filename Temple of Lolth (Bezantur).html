<p>The Temple of Lolth in Bezantur was the center of Thayan worship of Lolth , the Spider Queen, in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple was located near the waterfront in eastern-central Bezantur, the so-called "City of a Thousand Temples." Appropriately, it was surrounded by other temples, namely the Temple of Tyr and Temple of Gond to the west, the Temple of Bane and Temple of Kossuth to the north, and the Temple of Juiblex to the east.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The temple was a grand, black dome adorned with silver spiderwebs. Above the main doorway was a shining inscription in the Drow language which read: "Lolth tlu malla; jal ultrinnan zhah xundus" (meaning: "Lolth be praised; all victory is her doing").</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Services were held at midnight, and were surprisingly popular among the humans of Bezantur. Attendees considered themselves to be the "brethren" of the drow , and wore long black robes and often adorned themselves with pigments and wigs to appear like drow. A few actual drow were always in attendance as well, and the temple was visited once every few months by a drow High Priestess from the Underdark who served as the leader of the congregation and the overseer of the Temple's logistics.</p>
<p>Whenever the temple's drow High Priestess returned to the Underdark, a handful of the Temple's human worshipers were chosen to go with her. While these individuals were never seen or heard from again, the congregation was fervently convinced that they lived out their days indulging in the splendors of drow culture.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In addition to the human congregation, one or two drow were always in residence at the Temple.</p>
<p>In the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, the human congregation was led by a Thayan priestess named Rhytella , while the Temple's true High Priestess was the drow Triel Teienna , although she only visited once every few months.</p>
