<p>Blackiron Blades was a small smithy and weapons shop in Bryn Shander in Icewind Dale . Located a short distance north of the town square, it was known as a one-stop shop for travelers and adventurers .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The smith, Garn , made and sold the cheapest blades in the Ten-Towns , rather than trying to make better weapons to compete against the dwarves of Kelvin's Cairn . Garn's weapons were worth half the typical price. To keep the shop profitable, the manager of the store, Garn's sister Elza , marked up all other goods by 50%. She also expanded the shop's product line to include various adventuring supplies, such as fur cloaks and snowshoes .</p>
<p>Many veteran sellswords in Bryn Shander had disdain for Garn's lack of skill as a craftsman and joked about the quality of his blades, telling tales of unfortunate travelers that often ended with the words "…an' 'e was carryin' a Blackiron blade, to boot!"</p>
