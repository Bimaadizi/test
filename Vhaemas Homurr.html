<h2>History</h2>
<p>Born in 1302 DR , Vhaemas ruled for 35 years of peace until the start of the Twelfth Serôs War when Prince Vhaemas the Bastard allied with Iakhovas .</p>
<p>However, Iakhovas at last attacked Eadraal and King Vhaemas was forced to meet his son Vhaemas the Bastard in the battle. However, the two merfolk reconciled and together attacked Iakhovas, also helped by Princess Jian . They managed to destroy Iakhovas's trident but the monster killed the two younger merfolk and injured King Vhaemas.</p>
