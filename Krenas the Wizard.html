<p>Krenas the Wizard was an Eilistraean drow of Eilistraee's Wanderers in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As a potted plant, Krenas resided in a plain yet aesthetically pleasing brown ceramic pot, and had a thick stem and upward-spreading green fronds. When not a potted plant (which was most of the time), Krenas was a typical drow with a mess of white hair, and wore a bright blue robe .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Krenas joined Eilistraee's Wanderers at Myth Drannor to aid the Elves of Cormanthor with the Elven Crusade . Unfortunately for him, he fell victim to a surge of wild magic in the city that indefinitely transformed him into a potted plant. He was eventually rescued by allies, who used his magical amulet to reverse the transmutation while fighting off opportunistic giant spiders and ettercaps .</p>
