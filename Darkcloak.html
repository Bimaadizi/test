<p>Darkcloaks were specialty priests of the Church of Shar who served as oracles and care-givers to those in emotional distress.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>With skills in astrology and creating an aura of mystery about themselves, darkcloaks served as oracles who gave their predictions in the form of cryptic riddles and symbols. They also acted as carers who brought blessed forgetfulness and bliss to those with severe emotional issues.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>They held that life was filled with pain and suffering that Shar 's oblivion was the only thing that made it bearable. Darkcloaks were an oddity among Shar's clergy in that they actually provided beneficial services to others and held compassion for those in anguish. They even tended to be neutral , lawful , or even good , rather than evil . Their activities helped Shar's faith gain acceptance among the general public. Despite, the reputation of Shar's church meant even darkcloaks were reacted to with fear and suspicion.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Darkcloaks could see well in the dark thanks to infravision up to 60 feet (18 meters), and those who had infravision already found it extended by the same distance.</p>
<p>They could cast the forget spell several times per day depending on their skill. In addition, with a willing subject, a high-ranked darkcloak could utter a soothing word that removed a single terrible memory from the subject's mind. This could be done once per day.</p>
<p>Though they spoke in riddles and vague words, a darkcloak's augury was always successful. Moreover, a more experienced darkcloak could provide one person with a glimpse of the future once per day, with at least 40% chance of success that rose with practice.</p>
<p>Darkcloaks did not spend much time honing their martial skills and were often quite clumsy in combat. They fought even worse in sunlight or under a full moon. They were unable to use spells from the Combat sphere , and could only use the reverse forms of any spells from the Light sphere .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>As their name implied, darkcloaks wore long black cloaks with hoods, trimmed with purple. The rest of their attire was black, but often revealing. They wore a strange perfume that many swore possessed amnesia -inducing properties, but this was not verified and the Church of Shar refused to comment on the matter. In fact, it was all true: it someone came within 5 feet (1.5 meters) of a darkcloak and succumbed to the poison , they would grow forgetful, as if with the forget spell. The darkcloaks were of course immune, and should anyone obtain and apply this perfume, they would have the aroma and charisma of one sprayed by a skunk instead.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR , a darkcloak healer known as Sister Anna Lidwin worked at the House of Healing in the village of Reithwin in the Western Heartlands , healed all in need, even Harpers and Selûnites . During Ketheric Thorm's war circa 1373 DR , Anna was appalled at Malus Thorm 's inhumane orders to reserve treatments exclusively for the Sharran Dark Justiciars , let supplies dwindle, and leave wounds to rot and fester for his study, claiming it was the will of Shar. She wrote to the Chief Chirurgeon of the Harbourside Hospital in Baldur's Gate asking for aid, but she perished and Reithwin was ruined.</p>
