<p>Elairdrin Mellwith was a womanizing mage who resided in the Star Mounts of northwest Faerûn long before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Elairdrin's claim to fame was the creation of the first amulet of metaspell influence , which he called the Amplifier . His motivations were far from scholarly as the scoundrel used the Amplifier to aid his womanizing habits. Sometime later, the original Amplifier was taken from Elairdrin Mellwith by a wizard who planned to use the amulet to harness destructive magics. How the item was claimed remained unclear as historic accounts of that event varied wildly.</p>
