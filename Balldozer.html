<p>A balldozer , or binphallkahr in Quevquel , was a flying magical transportation device used by beholders .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The balldozer resembled a giant teacup or bowl , about 10 feet (3 meters) in diameter. When active, it hovered off the ground and had a translucent brown energy canopy with a circular patch of paler energy, mimicking the appearance of a beholder eye.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When a beholderkin settled inside it and uttered the command word , a translucent brown energy field emanated from the hemisphere and formed a complete spherical canopy. The balldozer moved quickly and protected the pilot, and could violently ram targets with an effect similar to a horn of blasting .</p>
<p>The balldozer was not invulnerable, and could be taken apart with sufficient physical damage. A dispel magic could also temporarily disable the device for a few minutes.</p>
