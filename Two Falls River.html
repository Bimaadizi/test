<p>Two Falls River was a tributary of the River of Ice in Calimshan .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The river began from springs high in the central Marching Mountains and flowed to the south.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As it flowed south, Two Falls River was pressed between the walls of two cliffs, increasing the flow of its current. The river received its name from a series of two waterfalls along its course. The first, Bottle Falls seemed to swallow the river whole, as the waters poured into a bottle-shaped lava tube. The waters of the river reappeared again a third of a mile southwest, erupting out of the earth at a hillside to form the second "falls".</p>
<p>As they continued still south, the waters carved a deep canyon, before they joined with those of Bakkal's Creek at the Cold Eyes to form the River of Ice.</p>
<p>The waters of the river were refreshingly cold.</p>
