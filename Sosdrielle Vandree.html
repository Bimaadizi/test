<p>Sosdrielle Vandree was a drow of House Vandree in Menzoberranzan in the Northdark in the early 14 th century DR . She was the consort of Gromph Baenre and mother of Liriel Baenre .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>She bore Liriel Baenre and raised her for the first five years of her life. Although Sosdrielle was astoundingly beautiful, she lacked ambition and magical talent, so she was not successful.</p>
<p>Gromph ordered her to be murdererd when Liriel was five, so that Gromph could then claim Liriel, who showed wizardly aptitude, as his own.</p>
<p>Unknown to all but a few, Sosdrielle was the subject upon which House Baenre 's impressive shrine to Lolth was modeled, it having been crafted by Gromph. When Liriel came of age, visitors to the shrine who knew her well enough began to notice the similarity between the image and the girl, Liriel having inherited her beautiful features mostly from her mother. During a conclave of the city council in the temple, the matron mothers took the likeness to be a sign from Lolth of her favor towards the girl.</p>
