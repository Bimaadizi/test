<p>Seyll Auzkovyn was a drow high priestess of Eilistraee and advisor to Lord Dessaer of Elventree in Cormanthor in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Seyll was young, less than 100 years old as of 1372 DR. She wore a lady's riding outfit with a knee-length skirt and a green jacket over a cream blouse. She also had matching knee-high boots. She wore mail marked with the symbol of Eilistraee and bore a sword enchanted against evil with a hilt that formed a working flute .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Seyll was a former priestess of Lolth who converted to Eilistraee. It was implied that one of the reasons Seyll converted was because her daughter was killed for failing some senseless test provided by Lolth. At first, Seyll told herself it because she'd been too weak to live. She was later captured by people of the surface, which was when she heard the message of Eilistraee. Some time in the 1360s DR, she settled in Elventree.</p>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the houseless Lolthite priestess Halisstra Melarn was captured by the forces of Elventree. Seyll attempted to convert Halisstra to her faith by sharing her message and placing a measure of unexpected trust in her. That trust was partially misguided, however, as Halisstra slew Seyll on the way to an Eilistraeean gathering, but Halisstra remembered her experience with Seyll and later converted to Eilistraee herself.</p>
<p>Halisstra later had a vision of Seyll that prompted her to begin seeking the Crescent Blade in order to kill Lolth.</p>
<p>Seyll's spirit appeared to Halisstra on the Astral Plane . Seyll had abandoned Arvandor for Eilistraee and for Halisstra. Seyll protected Halisstra from the return of Lolth. In the process, she was destroyed and sent to oblivion.</p>
