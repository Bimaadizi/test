<p>Garblers were formless aberrations that wielded Truespeak .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These masses of flesh and teeth babbled incoherently constantly.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Garblers were nominally sapient. They spoke but did not understand or communicate in any coherent language. Even telepathy did not allow communication with anything beneath their madness.</p>
<p>The creature lunged towards any flesh it discovered, out to feed.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The creature moved in a disjointed manner, dragging itself along with its flowing jaws. As it gibbered, it occasionally uttered something in truespeak in its "reversed" form, using them to hamper foes rather than bolster allies. Garblers employed six such utterances : defensive edge , morale boost , temporal twist , greater speed of the zephyr , spell rebirth , and preternatural clarity .</p>
<p>Despite the fact that a garbler did not understand any languages, it could effortlessly "counterspeak" or reverse any Truespeak utterance used in its vicinity. It had an uncanny, instinctive understanding of what was good and what wasn't, and could not be counted on to reverse a positive utterance on itself nor a negative utterance targetting an enemy. Bizarrely, a garbler found Truespeak to be no challenge whatsoever, and had no chance of erring in its utterances.</p>
<p>Being eyeless, it was unaffected by gaze attacks.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>They were solitary.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of 1373Â DR , the Red Wizards of Thay had furnished themselves with a few garblers captured recently from the Underdark . This contact with truename magic made it out to be a threat, as far as they could tell.</p>
