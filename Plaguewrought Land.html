<p>The Plaguewrought Land , also called the Plaguewrought Lands and the Changing Lands , was the largest plagueland in Faerûn following the events of the Spellplague .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Plaguewrought Land occupied an area south of the Vilhon Wilds and the Chondalwood where Sespech and Chondath had once stood. It was approximately 400 miles (640 kilometers) long by 200 miles (320 kilometers) wide, and covered the area formerly occupied by the Nagawater and the Golden Plains . The city of Ormpetarr was located at the northwestern border and the veil of the plagueland split the old city into two.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Plaguewrought Lands were said to be surreal but breathtakingly beautiful and grand. Inside this plagueland, the ground heaved like waves on the ocean and pieces of land levitated randomly to form earthmotes . The vegetation was strange and twisted, and could sprout, mature, and then die in a matter of minutes. Most people who travelled into this region were killed very quickly by the wild magic . Everything within the Plaguewrought Land—be it land, flesh, or the laws of nature—was contorted and changeable. It was the only place where plaguegrass was known to grow.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The border of the Plaguewrought Land remained more or less stable for the decades following the Spellplague. Pilgrims, encouraged by the Order of Blue Fire , often travel to the Plaguewrought Land in the hopes of acquiring a spellscar .</p>
<p>Following the Second Sundering in the 1480s DR, the Plaguewrought Lands were erased. Many of the settlements in the Vilhon that had been thought destroyed returned to Toril in one form or another.</p>
