<p>The River Samar was the only major river within the kingdom of Samarach on the Chultan Peninsula of southwest Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The river originated in the Sanrach Mountains in northern Samarach from several smaller creeks near the town of Taruin . It flowed south for approximately 100 miles (160 kilometers) before emptying into the Great Sea at the Bay of Omgar . The River Samar was an important landmark in Samarach in that it blocked the dense Samarlogh for encroaching on the eastern region of the kingdom. The capital of Samargol , as well as several smaller towns, were founded along its banks.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Small farming hamlets lined the banks of the river. Massive dwarven nets blocked the mouth of the river to keep any yuan-ti or other serpent folk from traversing its waters. Smaller nets that could be raised and lowered at various checkpoints were found along the inner stretch of the river.</p>
