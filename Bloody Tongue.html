<p>The Bloody Tongue were a tribe of orcs active in the Vast in the 7 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Bloody Crown, 649 DR , the orcs of the Bloody Tongue tribe joined a horde of orcs that engulfed the dwarven kingdom of Roldilar in the lands later known as the Vast. At Viperstongue Ford , the Bloody Tongue battled the elf hero Beluar and his forces, but were defeated and forced into a rout. As the sun set, Beluar's forces pursued the orcs north and east into an area of rolling, rugged hills . All through the night, they hunted and ran down the orcs, and trampled them with their horses , skewered them with lances , and lopped off their heads with their blades. Finally, Beluar's forces chased the remaining orcs up the North Road to the village of Maskyr's Eye . Beluar himself killed the last orc on the road in front of the village smithy at dawn.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The smith of Maskyr's Eye at the time had the opportunity to examine the Bloody Tongue's armor, and found it poor quality, comparable to the basic hardware known as blackwork.</p>
