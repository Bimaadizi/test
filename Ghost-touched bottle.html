<p>Ghost-touched bottles were enchanted containers of translucent and almost invisible glass that appeared ghostly . Bottle stoppers appeared melded into the glass, containing misty liquid inside.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The magic was not held within the liquid but in the bottle's glass itself. These bottles were ensorcelled with the ghost-touched enchantment that allowed the containers to contain small portions of the Ethereal plane .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , a ghost-touched bottle was left with Cahl-Hyred, the innkeeper of the Weeping Widow Inn in Targos by a cleric of Myrkul named Koluhm Bonecutter . Cahl-Hyred's superstition kept him from using or selling the bottle, and instead, he passed it along to the goblin slayers of Targos . Some said that later, the mercenaries were able to free a tortured ghost, Veira of the Weeping Widow Inn, and as the reward, she left them a single tear, caught within the bottle, suspended with the ghost-touched enchantment. They possibly used the tear to create the Sorrow's Tear magic dagger .</p>
