<p>Nevalarich was a red dragon living in the southern Thunder Peaks during the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nevalarich had massive jaws.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Nevalarich set out in a raid about once every few weeks.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Unknown to most, Nevalarich was under the command of Aurgloroasa , a shadow dragon dracolich affiliated with the Cult of the Dragon in Sembia .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nevalarich's age wasn't known very exactly. Around 1367Â DR , he was known to attack ships around the Neck of the Lake of Dragons every few weeks or months. He'd become a concern of the Crown of Cormyr , with Azoun IV having offered a title of nobility to whoever slew it. There was also extensive worry that he'd become bolder in the future, and wonder that it hadn't yet, limiting its depredations: it was no more destructive than local pirates. Nevalarich was itself operating under the orders of Aurgloroasa , destroying ships that had failed to pay her proper tribute.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Nevalarich had become a target for the Men of the Basilisk , who had decided to hire adventurers to slay it despite learning it was acting as the agent of Aurgloroasa. On the same year, a Cult of the Dragon cell led by Maezra set out to entice him into joining.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Aurgloroasa always took the guise of Nevalarich using magic when hunting around the mouth of the Lake of Dragons . It was believed that something else must be exerting stress upon Nevalarich to explain his rather low rate of raids, though his relationship to Aurgloroasa was not largely known, except to the Men of the Basilisk .</p>
