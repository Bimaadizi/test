<p>Crested helmets were an open-faced style of helmet found in the Realms.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These style of helmets covered most of the wearer's head and face, but left the center of the face open. They were distinguished from other helmets by a tufted crest across the helm's front axis. Some also sported flaps, which allowed the helmet's cheek pieces to be raised aside whenever a wearer was out of combat.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime after the sundering of the Ordning in 1485 DR , the fire giant warlord Baron Krelas Ugarak assembled an army of fire giants, goblinoids , and human mercenaries to wage a campaign of conquest against Secomber , moving on to Daggerford and eventually Waterdeep . As part of this nefarious plan he was developing a new form of siege engine , known as inferno bombards . The entrance to the Molten Vault where they were being developed was guarded by a large contingent of goblinoids, with the hobgoblins all outfitted in blackened steel armor and crested helmets.</p>
