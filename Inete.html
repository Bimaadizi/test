<p>Inete was an acolyte of Savras active in Port Nyanzaru in Chult during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>She was decently wealthy (enough to fund an expedition into the Chultan jungle). She lived and kept her possessions at Port Nyanzaru's Temple of Savras .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She was a member of Port Nyanzaru's Temple of Savras, and was given a great deal of leeway from the Temple's head, Grandfather Zitembe . She was quick to introduce new allies to her wise leader.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the events of the death curse , Inete was plagued by troubling visions of red-robed wizards establishing a secret base in the Aldani Basin deep in the Chultan jungle. She spoke with Grandfather Zitembe about her visions, who was too busy to help her investigate but gave her permission to travel to the Aldani Basin herself. She thus sought out adventurers already planning to travel into the jungle in hopes of joining them.</p>
