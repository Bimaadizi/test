<p>A shadowborn stalker was a humanoid who had undergone a radical transformation into a creature suffused with the power of the Shadowfell .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The transformation turned the humanoid's skin to a pale gray, their hair to pure black, and their eyes to pupil-less white. The power of the Shadowfell embedded itself into both their body and soul , and created a sinister aura of shadow around them.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Shadowborn stalkers gained darkvision as well as the abilities to turn invisible or to create a 5‑foot-radius (1.5‑meter) zone of magical darkness for a few seconds whenever they wished.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Becoming a shadowborn stalker required striking a bargain with the powers of the Shadowfell to access the forbidden lore and dark rituals that enabled the transformation. The most likely individuals to pursue this path included assassins , thieves , and warlocks —especially among goblins , drow , and shadar-kai —who favored stealthy approaches to their problems.</p>
