<p>Kathkote Dawntard was a nobleman in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He sounded sarcastic even in the best of times.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He appeared to have a reputation for rage, and for drink. Nonetheless, he was smart, patient and scheming.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was the son of the elder Dawntard. His usual companions were Broryn Windstag and Delasko Sornstern . He was also a co-conspirator with Marlin Stormserpent 's schemes, though Marlin thought he likely meant trouble.</p>
<p>Marlin's co-conspirators, including Dawntard, included largely families that had been ennobled recently, after the exiling of the Bleth house and the dispossession of the Cormaeril family.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He frequented the Bold Blazon .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By 1479Â DR , the young Kathkote had not traveled too far from Suzail in his life. He was a guest at the Open Feast held at Castle Obarskyr on Mirtul 26 of that year.</p>
<p>Kathkote Dawntard got into a fight at the Dragonriders Club at some point after the Open Feast, where he'd drawn steel with his toadies and bodyguards, threatening Arclath Delcastle and slaying Delnor , a palace messenger. They were stopped by the arrival of a number of Purple Dragon knights , who threatened they would not instantly take Broryn Windstag, then drunk, at his word. The whole club was questioned thoroughly afterwards. His group fled the tavern as soon as they could, being almost late for their meeting with Marlin.</p>
<p>After the meeting with Marlin, Dawntard and his toadies set out on an urgent quest for a largish hand-axe, protecting their identities with nothing but revel masks, half-aware at best that what they were doing was not very strategic. This, alongside the rewards they offered in many taverns, brought them to the notice of Swordcaptain Dralkin and War Wizard Glathra Barcantle . They only succeeded in their search after Manshoon , an ancient archmage, mind-steered them towards Lord Barandror Murandrake as part of a plan of his. They were then delivered to Stormserpent Towers by magic, where, after being ushered by Marlin into a secret passage, Kathkote fainted, leaving Broryn to explain they'd found the axe.</p>
<p>Word of their doings eventually got to their fellow noble Arclath Delcastle by way of the dancer Amarune Whitewave .</p>
