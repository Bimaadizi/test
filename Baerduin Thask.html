<p>Baerduin Thask was a human magic-user and a member of the adventuring company known as The Four .</p>
<p>His fellow members Telorn , Fiirfar Nulomn , and Diloule "Lanternhand" were all hanged as assassins in Tethyr on the day before Higharvestide in 1369 DR following the siege of Myratma . Baerduin would have faced a similar end but he escaped justice by leaping off the seaside cliffs overlooking the ruins of Ithalyr , laughing as he did so. Not even the sea elves ever found his body and his fate remains unknown.</p>
<p>Among his other crimes, Baerduin Thask was responsible for transforming prisoners into Broken Ones , bestial and misshapen combinations of humans and animals created as a result of scientific or magical experiments gone wrong.</p>
