<p>Halruaa was a land of magic , renowned for its electrum mines and its Haerlu wine . The fabled, quiet and wealthy magocracy was justly depicted as full of wonder. Created by archwizards foreseeing the fall of Netheril , Halruaa combined peace and harmony with the magic powers of their ancestors, but without the taint of their ambitions. Nearly all arcane casting Halruaans were wizards , with one third of the total populace having some sort of magical powers.</p>
<p>During the Spellplague , Halruaa was seemingly destroyed. In truth, however, to save their realm, Halruaan wizards shifted the kingdom into Abeir . When the Spellplague ended a century later, Halruaa was returned to Toril as part of the Second Sundering .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Halruaa stretched approximately 500 mi (800 km) from east to west, and more than 350 mi (560 km) from its southern border of the Great Sea to its northern foothills. It was divided into sections by three rivers that meet at Lake Halruaa , the northern shore of which was home to the nation's capital. The vast majority of the country consisted of flat, windswept plains, broken only by broad rivers or other notable landmarks. Common fauna in the region included rothé and aurochs .</p>
<p>Halruaa was bordered by mountain ranges on its north, east and west sides, known as the Walls of Halruaa , that acted as natural fortifications around the kingdom. The Nathaghals were to the north, the Muaraghals to the east, and the Lhairghals to the west. There was a narrow land of hill grasslands in the Nathaghals called the High Aluar, and this was the only non-mountainous land entrance to Halruaa. It could be accessed through the mountains at Talath Pass in the west, or Azhal Pass in the east.</p>
<p>All the major rivers in the region started from the Walls of Halruaa, and drained into Lake Halruaa.</p>
<h3>Climate</h3>
<p>Halruaa was a warm and humid land, with temperatures of more than 100 degrees in the summer, to between 80 and 90 degrees in winter. The climate was colder and more comfortable in the highlands than in the lowlands. Some mountains even had snowcaps. Because of its mountain ranges, the moisture rolled off the sea, producing sudden and frequent thunderstorms.</p>
<h3>Notable locations</h3>
<h2>Demographics</h2>
<p>As of 1372 DR , the vast majority of the Halruaan population was composed by humans, most of them of Halruaan origin while a minority were foreigners. The rest of the population was composed of dwarves , halflings , and a minority of elves and half-elves , who were allowed in the kingdom thanks to their affinity to the arcane magic .</p>
<h3>Society</h3>
<p>Halruaans congregated in numerous villages and cities scattered throughout the country's interior. Most were small settlements with no more than a few hundred inhabitants each, while the largest settlements were smaller than the cities of most other nations. The folk of the small villages usually relied on a venerated wizard to provide both protection and leadership, while likely also serving as mayor and a member of the Council of Elders , the ruling body of the country. The leader of the council was the Netyarch , or wizard-king.</p>
<p>With natural fortifications and the leadership of a score of diviners , Halruaans lived in a near-perfect haven. They rarely felt the necessity to travel except when they needed to get new magic items or spell components , as nowhere else in Faerûn would they have felt more comfortable than home. Since usually most Halruaan travelers were wizards, most people across Faerûn had the wrong belief that all Halruaans were wizards.</p>
<p>Life in the cities of Halruaa was touched by magic in many ways. Their houses had at least a few built-in magical enhancements, such as magical street lamps, while a favorite practice in cities along the coast was to produce "walls" of magically coaxed coral, via the coral growth spell. Spells that produced sparkling lights and pleasing sounds were often woven into fine fabrics to enhance their beauty. Fanciful means of travel, such as carpets of flying or skyships , were commonplace. Everywhere in Halruaa, people took great pains to show off their abilities as well as their wealth.</p>
<h3>Magic</h3>
<p>Because of the importance the Halruaans placed on magic, those with arcane abilities had better social status than those who didn't practice magic. Non- spellcasters were not prosecuted by law or despised, but magic-users had more advantages in Halruaan society.</p>
<p>For Halruaans the true path of magic was that of wizardry, and because of that, from at least 1372 DR, sorcerers were frowned upon and considered dangerous individuals, and most of them chose to leave Halruaa instead of downplaying their abilities. By the late 15th century DR , there were still sorcerers in Halruaa and they often gained their power through wild magic, due to the lingering effects of the Spellplague. At this time many in Halruaa were talented in the art, though they were not necessarily sorcerers.</p>
<p>Thanks to their emphasis in magic, Halruaans were highly educated. Children attended public schools until the age of thirteen, and this also served to search for potential wizards among them. They learned to use cantrips as part of their studies.</p>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>The faith of Mystra was the traditional religion of Halruaa. Azuth was also a popular deity in Halruaa since his ascension to godhood. After the Time of Troubles and the ascension of the second Mystra , many Halruaans lost their faith in her and converted to Azuth. However, the vast majority of Halruaans continued to be devoted to Mystra.</p>
<p>The faiths of Savras and Velsharoon also had a presence in Halruaa, although their churches weren't as prominent as those of Mystra and Azuth. In fact, by 1373 DR , both religions were mostly absorbed by the church of Azuth.</p>
<p>Halruaans didn't tolerate other faiths, and priests and clerics of other gods weren't allowed to enter into Halruaa proper (they could only dwell in frontier settlements) and to proselytize their faith. Those who violated this law were forced to leave the kingdom, usually by magical means.</p>
<p>Despite their laws against foreign religions, a small cult of Shar had spread in Halruaa in 1372 DR.</p>
<h3>Language</h3>
<p>Halruaans considered languages such as Common or Turmish to be barbaric.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The Halruaans were masters at crafting magical items, every bit as skilled as those in Thay . However they had no official exports out of their nation, as they closely guarded their magical secrets.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first settlers of Halruaa were Lapal tribes that had fled from the yuan-ti of the Mhair Jungles . Those peoples were also the predecessors of the Tashalans . They settled the sheltered basin of Halruaa and developed a simple and peaceful civilization of farmers, fisherfolk, and shepherds.</p>
<p>More than a thousand years later, a group of Netherese refugees fleeing the fall of Netheril, led by archmage Raumark , came to Halruaa. They found the lands of the Lapal tribes and it was here the wizards decided to make a stand should the Phaerimm follow them.</p>
<p>Instead of fighting over the land, the two peoples embraced each other peacefully. The Lapal taught the Netherese how to work the land, and the refugees taught the Lapal their magic arts. They also mixed with some arkaiun peoples from Dambrath . The three groups merged within only three generations. In the years that followed, Halruaa grew and prospered as a nation of wizards in relative isolation.</p>
<p>The Phaerimm never came, but Halruaa had to defend itself from attacks by all of its neighbors since then. Over the centuries Dambrath attacked and raided Halruaa's ports and borders multiple times. In 553 DR , Dambraii led by a magic-resistant barbarian king Reinhar I occupied all of the country south of Lake Halruaa. They were defeated in battle by the forces led by archmage Mycontil in 585 DR . The king of Lapaliiya also attacked Halruaa, in 1260 DR . He had allied with bandits from the Wastes, though the Halruaans were able to field a larger force, including wizards in their skyships. The attackers were easily routed.</p>
<p>1368 DR was marked by a crop failure across Halruaa. This unusual occurrence was the result of Lathander leaving a scorch mark on the fields of Chauntea 's realm - the Great Mother's Garden . The well-being of the sprawling fields of the realm were connected to health and fecundity of the Realms.</p>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR, a cataclysm was looming over Toril. As a nation lush with magic, Halruaa had its share of diviner —wizards who received warnings that their deities – Azuth and Mystra, were strengthening weave , its anchors and shaping new ones in preparation to what was to come. Some Halruaan Elders refused to heed the diviners' warnings, while others began feverish preparations of their own by weaving spells and magics into mythals and forcewebs that would encircle and shield Halruaa – ancient magics created by Lady Sheive Marandral of Netheril. This shell of sorcery was still in the process of being formed, when in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , the whole kingdom and the surrounding area was devastated by the Spellplague. At a great cost of Halruaan lives and loss of sanity among the realm's spellcasters, Halruaan mages used Lady Sheive's magic to use the energy of the blue fire to save most of their kingdom by shifting it into another world, Abeir.</p>
<p>However, the remaining Halruaan lands in Toril were laid to waste due to the heavy wild magic activity in the area in such a catastrophic way that the explosion was felt as far as Waterdeep . Those lands left behind were transformed into one of the most virulent plaguelands . Those who dared to explore the lands of Halruaa in the following years risked being infected by the halruaan consumption .</p>
<p>The surviving Halruaa was sent to a new world. The calamity of collapsing magic and devastating losses shifted attitudes of Halruaans towards magic, causing many to fear its use and dramatically reducing its utility in everyday life – a stark change to what Halruaa was on Toril. The transportation of Halruaa to Abeir came to be remembered as The Great Sacrifice , that cost the lives of many of the nation's elders who willingly sacrificed their magic and life force to the forceweb to guide the country across the planes to safety. Halruaa appeared in Abeir in an untamed mountainous region of that world. A colder region with thinner air, lack of drinkable water and none of their old infrastructure.</p>
<p>The surviving Halruaans continued to venerate their gods in the new world; many believed that Azuth gave a portion of his powers to save Halruaa, and that caused his silence in the years between the Spellplague and the Second Sundering a century later. On the new world, Halruaa struggled with the loss of most of its elders and the loss of spell-casting population as eight in ten arcanely gifted individuals perished and wild unexplored lands surrounded the country. Many Halruaans proclaimed that no magic would ever be used by them, despite being surrounded by dangers. But with a careful and mindful approach, Halruaans secured resources and crops they needed to survive the first winter, and the winter after that, and many that followed.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Rune Lords Triumphant, 1487 DR , after the most direct effects of the Spellplague had ended, Halruaa was returned to Toril as part of the Second Sundering, not via weaving another forceweb , nor via sacrifice, but through chaos that followed the Second Sundering. Halruaa returned much changed. It had less magic, less wealth, and less population, but it was still protected. Even without a standing army, the returned Halruaa was protected by wand -wielding mounted militia. The most powerful wizards of the country were now known as archlords – reclusive mage men and women who hoarded magic knowledge, treasure, and automatons. The archlords were ready to use their magic stockpiles to defend Halruaa from enemies, new and old, and could stand tall against usurpers such as Thay or the Zhentarim . On a local scale, Halruaan communities were governed by septars, who were in charge of magical resources and the law. Post return, Halruaa returned to its mining operations and producing goods the nation was famed for before the Spellplague. Magic was studied and respected, but never trusted, no used mindlessly. Soon after, Halruaa restored its political relations, trade, and dispatched envoys to Waterdeep , Ormpur , and Tashalar .</p>
