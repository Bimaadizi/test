<p>Keoghtom's ointment was an unguent used to clear poisons and disease, and heal wounds.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The salve was a magic item that was named after Keoghtom. The unguent jar was small, about 3 inches (0.076 meters) in diameter and 1 inch (0.025 meters) deep. One to three jars were commonly found together. It was a thick mixture that smelt faintly of aloe.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When placed upon a poisoned wound, or swallowed, it detoxified poisons and diseases. If rubbed on the body, it healed moderate wounds. For those who could not be cured by restorative spells, either rest or a magical item such as this ointment had to be used.</p>
<p>Keoghtom's ointment could be used alongside everwater to create a magical solution that allowed for preservation of monster tissues as well as magic that was held inside. Such preserved items included beholder eyes that, when soaked in this solution, retained their magical gazes for indefinite amount of time.</p>
