<p>Archdruid Kurush yn Arib el Nayet was the son of a Calishite naval captain who became a follower of Silvanus and founded the Golden Grove in Memnon with Silvanus' miraculous blessing.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kurush was the son of Rysal Arib el Nayet , but not wanting to follow in his father's footsteps as a man of the sea, he fled as a youth to the north and became an adventurer. During his adventuring days, he even explored the infamous ruins of Myth Drannor . Falling in love with the lush, green trees of the north, so different from those of his native Calimshan , he became a follower of the nature god Silvanus, a god who was then nearly unheard of in that southern land.</p>
<p>Desiring to share his new patron with his countrymen, he returned to his home in Memnon, to his grandfather's estate. When he entered the garden of that villa, a miracle awaited him; when he touched the golden sculptures of trees there, they became living trees. Kurush dedicated the garden to Silvanus and named it the Golden Grove.</p>
