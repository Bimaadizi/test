<h2>History</h2>

<p>By the 14 th century DR , it came into the possession of Tamoko , the follower and lover of the Bhaalspawn Sarevok .</p>
<p>Dark Lord Hertiuos, undead Warlord of Bane, wore this piece of armor over more than 500 years. During this time he was rumored to dwell in a castle somewhere within the Earthfast Mountains. How his armor moved to other lands without him is not certain, though the seperation of the two was surely unpleasant.</p>
