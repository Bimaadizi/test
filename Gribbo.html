<p>Gribbo was a goblin cultist of the Absolute who dwelled within the Shattered Sanctum during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She wore a simple, stitched leather dress that she kept cinched with a cloth belt.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the cultists of the Absolute launched a terrible raid against the Waukeen's Rest inn, killing many and capturing others. It was around that time that Gribbo caught her very own "Pigeon", a rather famous bard by the name of Volothamp Geddarm . Gribbo had Volo perform recitations in front of her fellow Absolutists. For the occasion he crafted an ode to their leader, Dror Ragzlin .</p>
<p>Gribbo knew she should hand over her prized "Pidge" to her superior Minthara Baenre , but was so captivated by his charm she could not bring herself to let him go.</p>
