<p>Maquar crusaders were a noble class of warriors in the service of the rajah of Estagund . They were unwaveringly loyal champions that lived modest lives in service to their ruler. They were especially renowned for their skill with a falchion .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Maquar's primary responsibility was to serve and protect the rajah of a given land. The tasks they performed varied, but they would obey without question. For example a single crusader may have acted as bodyguard for any member of the royal house and their family or as a guardian of foreign diplomats. They served as military advisers and, if needed, banded together to defend their nation.</p>
<p>In return for this dedicated service, the rajah provided any goods they might have needed.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Maquar crusaders followed a strict code of conduct in their service to the rajah and Estagund as a whole. Prospective members had to live by this code a month before they were allowed admission into their ranks. Failure to adhere to these tenets led to expulsion and the loss of having an honored rank within society.</p>
<p>The code of the Maquar stated that:</p>
<p>All Maquar crusaders were also followers of the tenets and faith of the Adama.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>A crusader's training focused on their devotion to protecting their charge. They trained in throw themselves in harm's way whenever they faced a lethal threat.</p>
<p>Their marital training involved developing attacks made from a defensive posture, capable of deflecting incoming blows. Alternately, they could counter with a broad attack made to smite their foes down.</p>
