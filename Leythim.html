<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Manip Leythim frequented The Singing Lute eatery and tavern in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate. There, the Manip spilled his gut about his amorous misadventures of late. Leythim found himself in a tryst with Henrietta Hhune , daughter of Hurlbut Hhune , a Baldurian patriar. Their romance was ill-received as Henrietta was betrothed to Derque Rillyn , a notoriously foul-tempered patriar noble. During the Absolute crisis , Hurlbut Hhune hired thugs to beat Leythim up to convince the man to leave Henrietta for her noble marriage. The Manip sought a simple healing potion to patch himself up after the fight. He could not kick up a fuss over the nobles' business as he was afraid of a blowback to his beloved Hen.</p>
