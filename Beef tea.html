<p>Beef tea was a savory drink often used as "cure" for a hangover and general cold sickness.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The so-called beef tea was concocted by making meat broth, mixing it with hot kitchen drippings from roasts, a dash of brandy , sherry , or even zzar . The name remained the same no matter what kind of meat was used to make stock or what roasts were going in the kitchens, and the alcohol used often was the dregs.</p>
<p>In Cormyr and the Dalelands , venison was the most common meat used in mixing a swirl of beef tea, while such meats as old oxen , boars , moose , cattle , hogs were less common. Wild animal meats, such as bears and raccoons , were also not unheard of.</p>
