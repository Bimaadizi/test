<p>Darvik was a gnome inhabitant of the town of Ghars in Cormyr in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was small with a gravelly voice, and had skin that was brown, lined and leathery in a manner distinctive of gnomes.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was very earnest and polite, always calling people "sir"—or "sor" in his thick accent—and fearful of tracking mud into their homes. However, he was also very long-winded and rambling. Being practical, he always had a candle and flint and steel , "because you never know, no, you don't".</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>There was a Missus Darvik.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Once a month, Darvik went into the Vast Swamp to pick peat for burning in the stove. He knew the ways of the dangerous swamp fairly well.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On Eleint 18 of the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , while picking peat in the Vast Swamp, Darvik discovered an open trapdoor at his favorite spot, which he'd not noticed before because it had been concealed with moss . Venturing inside, he discovered the tomb of Fastred , a notorious bandit chieftain of centuries past, but more significantly a still-burning torch and a freshly and bloodily slain body. He immediately fled, fearing the perpetrator might still be there and attack him next.</p>
<p>Out of the swamp and on the road, Darvik encountered a Purple Dragons patrol led by Captain Flim . Darvik showed them the body, which Flim recognized to be that of the king's envoy, Grodoveth . Flim alerted Mayor Tobald , and they informed Benelaius , Jasper , and Lindavar , who were investigating a previous murder , with Darvik giving his account.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Darvik guided Flim, Jasper, and Lindavar through the Vast Swamp and back to the site, showing them where to walk and how to avoid a thornslinger tree. He waited outside while they examined the scene; briefly, they considered Darvik as a culprit, but dismissed it based on footprint evidence and the difficulty of a small gnome to behead such a large human . Darvik led them out and headed back to his holding.</p>
