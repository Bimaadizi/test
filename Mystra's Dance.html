<p>Mystra's Dance was an island at the mouth of the Delimbiyr River .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The isle was part of a delta formed out of bare islets , but the isle itself had at least two hills, one of which held an altar.</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>There was a stone pier on the shore; a hill separated the pier from another hill, atop which was a dark, circular featureless altar.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the turn of the 230's DR , the Mystran priestess Elmara (secretly prince Elminster Aumar of Athalantar ) was bid by the mad mage of Calishar , Ilhundyl , to deliver Ondil's Book of Spells to the altar on Mystra's Dance.</p>
<p>In Year of Much Ale, 233 DR , she completed the task. Upon her placing the book on the stone, the ghostly hands of a lich pulled the book away, and an apparition of a woman twice her height in a flowing gown appeared; Elmara followed her from the hill and into the waters, where she found herself capable of treading. At a certain distance from the shoreline, a voice called out "you have failed me", and her water walking was stopped, making her plunge into the icy depths.</p>
<p>She survived. Not long after, she petrified and teleported several of Seldinor Stormcloak 's apprentices, who had just gotten stabbed in a barfight at the nearby Unicorn's Horn tavern, to the same waters where she almost drowned.</p>
<p>By the 14 th century DR , the mouth of the Delimbiyr had become the Lizard Marsh .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>In the early-to-mid 3 rd century DR , it was said people who spent overnight in the island were subject to a number of maladies, some of them deadly.</p>
<p>The island was named as such because it was believed to hold the first of all altars to Mystra.</p>
