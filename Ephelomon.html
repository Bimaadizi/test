<p>Ephelomon was a red great wyrm consort of the Queen of Dragons, Tiamat , and later a consort of the Lich-Queen, Vlaakith I .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In ancient times, after the giths ' uprising against the illithids and the schism between the giths , Mother Gith sought out potential allies to secure her race's future and advance the Eternal Crusade . Gith's advisor Vlaakith proposed the goddess Tiamat an agreement, details of which remained a secret. To conclude the agreement Mother Gith went to the Nine Hells herself and never returned. Legends spoke of Tiamat sending Ephelomon to the githyanki to relay Gith's ultimate directive, which was for them to carry on their crusade under the rule of Vlaakith I, the leader designated in accordance with Gith's will. Vlaakith was granted the scepter of Ephelomon , signifying the everlasting alliance between githyanki and red dragons.</p>
<p>Ephelomon stayed with Vlaakith I and became her consort. The duthka'gith , who were half-githyanki warriors , claimed to be descended from Ephelomon. Some tales of their birth suggested that Vlaakith employed Ephelomon's bloodline to fashion them as preeminent warriors, surpassing the majority of the githyanki.</p>
<p>After the end of the War of the Comet , a story detailing Prince Orpheus 's demise was relayed to the githyanki people. It was said that Orpheus had been killed by Kith'rak Voss and Ephelomon had devoured the remains of the prince's body. In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , however, the True Soul heroes discovered that the prince remained among the living, and this narrative was revealed to be one of Vlaakith I's and her descendants' schemes.</p>
<p>After Ephelomon's death one of his horns was used to create the Draakhorn .</p>
