<p>Scour was a Voidharrow demon who entered Toril through a gate from another universe with his "sibling" Murmur hundreds of years before the Spellplague . Scour's consciousness was scattered into many pieces but Murmur was apparently able to revive much of Scour's mind.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Scour's corporal form, such as it was, consisted of a mass of mutated vermin.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By 1480 DR , Scour was in Luskan , manifesting as a swarm of mutated vermin. Scour infected many inhabitants with the Fury plague, which caused victims to go into a homicidal rage . Scour attacked an assembly of Luskan's gangs, killing many people. He was confronted in Luskan's underground by Kalen Dren , Myrin Darkdance , and Sithe and defeated. Sithe sacrificed herself by using her innate abilities to open a portal to the void where she took the remaining fragments of Scour.</p>
