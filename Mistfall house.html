<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The lower levels were home to several monsters despite efforts to clear them out.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During its prime, the temple appeared to have access to a variety of expensive wares that were transported to various Dales. The source of this wealth appeared to be from the Underdark, but it remained a mystery with whom the Leirans were trading with.</p>
