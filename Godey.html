<p>Godey was a sentient skeleton servant of the vampire lord Cazador Szarr , who resided in the Szarr Palace of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Godey was a decrepit skeleton adorned in ancient decaying plate armor and a helmet. A decorative Szarr family ring adorned the creature's skeletal finger, allowing passage to sealed and secured areas of the palace.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>For centuries before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Godey had been tasked with torturing and keeping Cazador's vampire spawn in line and obedient. The torture sessions sometimes lasted for days in the palace's kennels. Despite the cruelty, Godey felt no ill will towards the targets of the torture and simply considered it to be doing his job. He did, however, enjoy sweet screams of his victims.</p>
