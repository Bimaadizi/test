<p>Quth-maren were undead creatures created from flayed corpses by clerics of Kiaransalee .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>With every scrap of skin flayed from their bodies and their exposed muscles incessantly oozing acidic blood, the quth-maren were hideous creatures. Unlike zombies , quth-maren did not decompose.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Intelligent adversaries and vicious in groups, quth-maren had a number of abilities that made them disturbing opponents.</p>
<p>They had caustic blood that burned those who touched it. Their bodies constantly oozed this caustic blood, so anyone that struck the quth-maren in melee unarmed or with a natural weapon would be harmed themselves. Moreover, a quth-maren could even spit a glob of this blood every so often, causing it to splash over foes near where it landed.</p>
<p>A quth-maren could rapidly heal from wounds inflicted on it.</p>
<p>A quth-maren could attempt to command undead in the same manner that an evil cleric could.</p>
<p>Any living creature that came within 30 feet (9.1 meters) of a quth-maren and met its baleful gaze risked simply cowering in fear at the sight of it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1372 DR , Dorina T'sarran seized control of Szith Morcane and ordered the priestesses of Lolth there to be flayed and transformed into quth-marens.</p>
