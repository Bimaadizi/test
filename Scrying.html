<p>Scrying was the magical ability to use one's senses to experience events far away.</p>
<h2>Magical sensor</h2>
<p>Many divination spells of the scrying subschool created a magical sensor that sent the caster information. The sensor had the sensory acuity of the caster and acted as though it were a separate, independent organ. Any intelligent creature could notice an active magical sensor. The sensor could be dispelled.</p>
<h2>Limits</h2>
<p>Scrying could not penetrate lead , with lead sheeting or high concentrations in natural rock being effective barriers. Some buildings such as the House of the Moon had a lead lining in their outer walls for this purpose.</p>
<p>Several magic spells, antimagic field , mind blank , nondetection , and wardmist could block scrying. Magical items such as weirdstones could also block scrying. The semi-precious stone tchazar could blur the scrying of anything close to it.</p>
<h2>Aids</h2>
<p>A chrysoberyl gem ( aka "cat's eye") could be used for short-range but very detailed scrying.</p>
