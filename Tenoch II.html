<p>Tenoch the Second was the sixth Revered Counselor of the great Nexalan empire whose rule lasted for twenty one years.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tenoch the Second was selected by the Nexalan court in the Year of the Bone Helm, 1191 DR after the death of the Revered Counselor Tolco . Tenoch II was the great-grandson of the Mighty Ipana III , and his reign was just as prosperous as his ancestor's. Under Tenoch, Nexal gained no new lands, but the empire established trade routes with Cordotl and Palul , solidifying them as parts of the empire. He ordered roads to be paved to both lands, merging in the causeways that led to the Heart of the True World. The second major causeway was paved to the edges of Huacli peoples' territory. Regular patrols and way-houses made the trade flourish.</p>
<p>The third major road project connected the nation of Nexal with its subjugated territory of Pezelac . The road construction was abandoned after the Pezelac rebellion. Tenoch's son, general Chimal was put in charge of a mighty Nexala army sent to quell the Pezels' unrest. Overzealous in his task, Chimal almost completely leveled a Pezelac city as an example of punishment for rebellion. The cruel show of force subdued the unrest, and Pezelac resumed their tribute payments to Nexal. Chimal brought back a large number of slaves and goods that paid the war expenses off tenfold.</p>
<p>The success was celebrated by a ritual sacrifice of five thousand men to the Bloody Zaltec , god of war. Tenoch II ordered the holy pillar of Zaltec to be elevated atop the Great Pyramid , making it the highest man-made point in Maztica.</p>
<p>The Year of Ocean's Wrath, 1212 DR was marked by the death of the Revered Counsellor Tenoch II and Chimal's ascension to Nexal's throne. The following eighteen years were calm and prosperous for the empire, apart from regular expeditions against Kultaka .</p>
