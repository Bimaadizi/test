<p>The Wintergnaw pack was a pack of winter wolves that lived in Dragonscar Gorge and fought alongside the Frosthunger Horde in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The pack's howls and snarls were ever-present on the winds of Dragonscar Gorge, and their hunting territory encompassed both the Gorge and the nearby Shimmersky Valley . Travelers through the Valley were the ones who named the pack "Wintergnaw", owing to how the wolves constantly nipped at their heels.</p>
<p>The Wintergnaw wolves were led in battle by their elders, who had grown to be the strongest and largest members of the pack.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>With the arrival of Shattercrown and his frost giants in Dragonscar Gorge in the late 15 th century DR, the pack was cowed and made into loyal members of the Frosthunger Horde upon witnessing Shattercrown's strength. The giants then trained the winter wolves to fight with coordination and purpose, and used them to keep the Horde's goblinoid laborers in check as they excavated the ancient ruins of Thrymstone .</p>
<p>When adventurers from Waterdeep arrived to drive back the Horde, the Wintergnaws harried them on their way through the excavation sites in the Gorge. However, the adventurers' arrival coincided with an attack on the Horde by white dragons led by Kovanyrach , which split the winter wolves' attention. The Wintergnaws drove the adventurers onto the rougher paths through the Gorge before turning their focus to the dragons .</p>
