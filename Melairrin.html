<p>Melairrin was an ancient dwarven citadel that sat in the heart of Mount Sar in the Sword Mountains north of Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The ancient dwarfhold was long abandoned, and consisted of both a citadel and adjoining caverns. It connected to the exterior of Mount Sar via western tunnels that led through the abode of the frost giant Harshnag , a member of the Gray Hands . The lower reaches of the hold were also accessible via a portal known as the Sundered Throne in the Dungeon Level of Undermountain , although reports differed as to whether this was a one- or two-way gateway.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The fortress was claimed by the orcs of Uruth Ukrypt shortly after the founding of their realm in the Year of the Red Rain, 927 DR , and provided them a secure base from which to wage wars on the surrounding human and gnome settlements of the Sword Coast North and Dessarin Valley . It also served as the seat of the realm's political power where the Bloodbone Throne of Uruth was kept.</p>
<p>During the Rage of Dragons in the Year of the Dracorage, 1018 DR , the black dragon Shammagar attacked Melairrin and claimed it from the orcs as his lair. Three centuries later, much of his hoard was famously plundered by Asilther Graelor , a wood elf thief and Harper . Wary of further thefts, Shammagar abandoned the citadel to seek more remote lairs in the middle of the Trackless Sea and to take revenge on Asilther.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , Melairrin was home to a variety of monsters that had arrived from the caverns of the Underdark beneath it, as well as to bands of half-dragon orcs believed to be descended from Shammagar. The deepest depths of the fortress hosted the lair of Rorrina Stoneshaft , a dwarven vampire who served Artor Morlin of Waterdeep.</p>
