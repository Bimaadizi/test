<p>Tan'u was a butu "warrior", better described as a rogue , that hailed from the Courage tribe of the Malatran Plateau and the slopes of the Fire Mountain , active in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tan'u was a boastful man, but it was just a cover for his fearfulness.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR , the Tribe of the Wise Ones became aware of a looming threat. The leader of the dreaded spider katanga , the Mother of a Thousand Young was swollen with a thousand children ready to overflow the jungles. In preparation for the birthing, she initiated a ritual that sent deadly poisons into the rivers cascading off the Fire Mountain . Tan'u was among the younger and less experienced heroes of the Living Jungle who answered the call, along with Temenu Farseer of the Wise Ones , caimian katanga Roq Silent Hunter , tam'hi Allanna , and Koshiva tribesman named Green Spirit . Tan'u's group was sent to enter the spider katanga caverns and faced hunting spider katangas who guarded previously captured adventurers.</p>
<p>It was unknown if Tan'u survived the battle, but the Mother of a Thousand Young was defeated, and heroes returned to the Village of the Wise Ones for their reward and facilitated the clean-up and nature's healing.</p>
