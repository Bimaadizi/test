<p>Warmonger genies were special tasked genies who served as strategists and advisors to generals and lords. They were found leading soldiers or mercenaries. If there was not a war to be found then they would usually start one.</p>
<p>Originally created from efreet , warmongers only retained that race's inherent thirst for war. They were unique among tasked genies in that they usually desired to outstay their service to a sha'ir . They accomplished this by vowing to uphold a particular cause, dynasty, or kingdom as opposed to serving a single king or lord. This allowed them to resist the dismissal from individuals. Warmongers often turned against those who summoned them if they believed the summoner was barring them from completing their given task.</p>
