<p>Grimwald's dagger was a +1 enchanted dagger that, when drawn, emitted the continuous noise of an angry, yapping dog and even louder barking noises when it struck an opponent. This effect would often cause the victim to helplessly burst out into laughter.</p>
<p>Once per day the wielder could, at will, cause the blade to emanate a shrill scream that hasted its attacks and greatly increased the damage it dealt.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>These daggers were first popularized by Lady Alustriel Silverhand of Silverymoon and were named after the aged wizard Grimwald who delighted in taunting his cats .</p>
