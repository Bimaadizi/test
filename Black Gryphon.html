<p>The Black Gryphon was an inn in the city of Elturel in the Western Heartlands in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<p>It was once managed by the sisters Allet and Vindara Tzuntzin , but their more monstrous clientele and visitors were unwelcome in Elturel. They sold the inn and moved to Waterdeep , opening the Misty Beard before the mid–1360s DR.</p>
<p>As Lord Dhelt decreed that inns and taverns could not operate under the same roof, and inns could not serve drinks, the Black Gryphon was expressly an inn.</p>
