<p>Terbakar was the ancient capital of Bakar in the Raurin . The river Athis had once sprang from within the Pyramid of Amun-Re in the city.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Terbakar's ruins were visible from the tops of dunes 5 miles (8 kilometers) away, though there was nothing worthy of note beyond the pyramid, its surrounding wall, and the temple of Amun-Re along the wall. The wall itself was degraded, in contrast to the pyramid, which was immaculate. Ahead of the pyramid, there was a lime-cement basin, 100 feet (30 meters) in diameter, from which the river Athis had once been fed; because of the curse, there was nothing but sand on it.</p>
<p>In 1356 DR , after the Pyramid of Amun-Re was plundered and the curse lifted, the river Athis began flowing again, slowly refilling its banks over the years.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Terbakar served as the capital of Bakar; it was built close to the magical spring of the River Athis, along which the entire kingdom of Bakar was situated. The capital was known as a jewel of the desert. Its pharaohs had ruled for time out of mind, and though its libraries were noted in some circles, the Waters themselves were what was revered.</p>
<p>By the year 300 DR , the Pharaoh Amun-Re constructed a pyramid to serve as his own tomb. To finance its construction, he raised taxes and waged war on neighboring kingdoms. Discontent rose in response to the pyramid's construction; the pharaoh was slain during a riot. His dying curse caused the spring of the river Athis to refill no longer, causing Terbakar, in fact the whole of Bakar and the entire river basin, to depopulate quickly.</p>
