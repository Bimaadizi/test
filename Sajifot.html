<p>Sajifot was a sorcerer member of a marauding orc tribe that fought against the dwarven King Taik and sought to conquer his underground kingdom.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sajifot's main footnote in history was his death at the hands of King Taik longe before 1372 DR . The orcish sorcerer's essence was used to create an enchanted weeping for the King, the Blood Frenzy . Sajifot's innate bloodthirstiness powered the weapon's magics, and the axe later was used to behead Kumon , the leader of the horde that sought to destroy King Taik's kingdom.</p>
