<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Harbingers of Ixthul originally began as a paladin order of Moradin , led by a powerful paladin by the name of Deymoden . Much of what occured between that time and the order's shift into a cult was lost to time, as few of their writings or records survived, but at some point a major change occured. Deymoden changed their name to Ixthul and began striving to become a deity of demigod or exarch status.</p>
<p>The other paladins, dedicated to Ixthul's cause, followed their lead in creating a divine artifact of war for the purpose of destroying a great evil. To avoid any act of treachery, the order stored this weapon within a specially prepared chamber, guarded by an eidolon that Ixthul had originally created in service to Moradin. Before the Harbingers of Ixthul had a chance to use their divine artifact of war, they were struck by internal betrayal and quickly fell apart.</p>
