<p>Ayo Armbrust was the son of Talli and Tym Armbrust , a down-on-his-luck tailor, from Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ayo was a human boy who took on his father's appearance â€“ light skin, light brown hair, and dark brown eyes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Ayo and Talli's wellbeing was threatened by Tym's debt to the notorious Guild of Baldur's Gate. When Tym was unable to pay, Nine-Fingers Keene implicitly threatened the tailor's family in a letter and notified him of collectors coming to collect the late fee. The family's struggle was noticeable to Talli's friends, Sabine and Freddie , who visited the Armbrusts. They offered to help the family out by taking in little Ayo to give Talli and Tym some privacy and a way to relax. While at home, Ayo was instructed by his father not to talk to "tax collectors" where they were to show up.</p>
