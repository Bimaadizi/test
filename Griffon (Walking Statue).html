<p>The Walking Statue of Waterdeep known as the Griffon materialized in Waterdeep in 1479 DR in response to an attempted intrusion into Ahghairon's Tower . After flying over the city, it came to rest facing southeast toward the Dock Ward on Mount Waterdeep near Peaktop Aerie . Due to its location, many believed it was simply a monument to the Griffon Cavalry , but that was not true.</p>
<p>The statue itself appeared as its name impliesâ€”a griffon standing on all four legs, although it was approximately twenty feet tall and made of granite .</p>
