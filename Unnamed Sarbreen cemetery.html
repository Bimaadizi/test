<table border='1'><tr><th>Type</th><td>Graveyard</td></tr><tr><th>Region</th><td>Crow's End , Ravens Bluff</td></tr></table><br>
<p>This small graveyard was an ancient burial site in Raven's Bluff , dating back long before it had been founded and incorporated into one city, back when the land was part of Sarbreen . By the 14 th century DR , the graveyard had fallen into a state of disuse and neglect.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This graveyard was located somewhere in the Crow's End district, near the south bank of the Fire River , close to some caves. It was boxed in on all sides by buildings, ones that were considered "old" by 1355 DR . Close by the graveyard was a sewer grate framed by granite stones.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This graveyard covered an area of 40 ft (12 m) x 30 ft (9.1 m), with a perimeter surrounded by a 4 ft (1.2 m) tall, iron fence. Set into the west side of this rusty fence was a small gate.</p>
<p>It was dotted with tombstones and statuary made of slate , as well as an abundance of weeds. Much of this statuary was in a decaying state by 1355 DR. Most of the tombstones had dates preceding the foundation of Ravens Bluff, save for two that were carved when the city was still relatively new.</p>
<p>One notable piece of statuary was a marble pedestal, topped with a marble carving of a nest, a few chicks, and a raven . It also bore a unique Dethek rune, the family sign of the Stoneshapers , an ancient dwarven clan. The statuary was a depiction of The Menagerie , an ancient relic which the Stoneshapers and other dwarven clans of the Vast had banded together to create. All together the piece weighed 250 pounds (110 kilograms).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of the Harp, 1355 DR , some of the graveyard's coffins and their interred dead had fallen down into a forgotten dwarven building that had been bricked up when Ravens Bluff's sewer system was constructed. It was steeped in a 1 ft (0.3 m) of brackish water, with coffins or bits of coffins floating in it, and the bottoms of coffins visible in the ceiling.</p>
<p>Sometime around 1355 DR, a group of adventurers were potentially jumped by a Zhentarim mercenary force under the employ of Erin Fleetwing and dragged into this cemetery. There they were threatened, interrogated about their relationship to Vernon Condor , and asked as to the exact nature of the mission they were undertaking for him. Once satisfied, the Zhents left with the valuables of the restrained adventurers, saying that some sort of spectre would feast upon them. When the adventurers eventually freed themselves and made it into the underground chamber next to the sewers, they observed that the bottoms of some coffins above them had been gnawed open and that at least one skeleton was pinned to the west wall. A set of granite stairs along the west wall lead up to an open archway, leading into an ancient 5 ft (1.5 m) wide tunnel that had become infested with rats and small spiders .</p>
