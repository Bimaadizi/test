<p>A stele ( pl : stelae pl : steles ) were slabs erected in many parts of the Realms as monuments. Often made of stone, their surfaces were covered in inscriptions, sometimes of an ornamental nature, ornamental carvings, or both. The reasons for their creation could vary significantly, from marking territorial boundaries, to funerary purposes, or to document or commemorating historical events or personages.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Edimu , a beloved horse from Jazirat al-Sayyad , passed from the world a mausoleum was constructed for him in Sokkar. Placed within this mausoleum was a stele, depicting Edimu galavanting in the hills of a fertile island, along with an inscription in Chun that labeled it "Jazirat al-Sayyad." It was accompanied by a life-sized ka figure made of alabaster , adorned with a golden bit and bridle . The bridle was encrusted in diamonds and sapphires , as well as inscribed with Chun runes that bore Edimu's name and wishes for a long, happy afterlife. However, ghouls later looted the chambers and stole the horse's bit and bridle, breaking both his ka figure and stele in the process, and thus untethering his spirit from the afterlife.</p>
