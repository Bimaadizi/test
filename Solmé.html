<p>Solmé was one of the seven liches who created Crenshinibon , and was later consumed by it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Solmé of Gharr had learned of a way to live for millennia: on reaching old age, young children were identified and Solmé's life force placed into them. Solmé's transformation into a lich came before the last incarnation grew into an adult, so it eternally appeared as a child.</p>
<p>Solmé was a rival of a fellow lich, Fetchigrol . In order to spawn undead , Solmé would travel to the Shadowfell to directly raise an army, whereas Fetchigrol would reanimate those who had fallen. Fetchigrol believed he had been bested by Solmé.</p>
