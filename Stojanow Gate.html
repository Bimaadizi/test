<p>The Stojanow Gate was a pair of massive iron-bound doors protecting Valjevo Castle on the city of Phlan . Flanked by towering gatehouses, the place served as the city's prison and as the headquarter of the Knights of the Black Fist .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>One of the oldest structures in Phlan, the Stojanow Gate was a monumental structure almost 60 feet (18 meters) high and 100 feet (30 meters) wide, which stretched all the way between two channels of the Stojanow River . Its 30 feet (9.1 meters) wide walls displayed breathtaking scenes featuring folk heroes, royalty, wizards , dragons and deities .</p>
<p>On top of the walls, inhabitants could witness the dead bodies of criminals hung by the Black Watch feeding the city's ravens .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The gate served as a place to collect tolls, as well as keep prisoners and interrogate them. Prisoners held in the Gate's prison cells usually only stayed for a couple days before they were released—or hanged. An officer manning a desk outside the structure handled the demands and complaints of individuals asking for the release of their loved ones.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>While the Gate was built to defend Phlan's castle, it was actually kept open permanently, except in times of war.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During a surprise attack in the Year of the Queen's Tears, 902 DR , Zhentarim forces managed to capture Stojanow Gate without a fight.</p>
<p>Following the attack by Vorgansharax in the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , the Tears of Virulence managed to close the gate for the first time in more than a century.</p>
