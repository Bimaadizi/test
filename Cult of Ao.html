<p>The Cult of Ao ( pronounced : /ˈ eɪ oʊ / AY-oh ) was the primary religious organization dedicated to the worship and service of Ao , the Hidden One.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>In much the same way that the Aoists lacked the oversight of their patron Overgod , so too did they lack any kind of unifying leadership. The result was a heavily fragmented Cult of Ao, one without the support of any affiliated groups or orders within its ranks. Only two sects were known to have outlasted the quick and unceremonious dissolution that took their fellows across Faerûn —and, even then, the Zazesspuran cell was secretly puppeteered by the Mad God, Cyric .</p>
<p>The largest of the cult cells, the Aoists of Waterdeep were lucky to avoid such ministrations, unlike their southern cousins. However, as opposed to the typical proselytizing, this latter group was focused on sagely debate, working primarily to uphold the Balance in perceived—if not necessarily affirmed—accordance with Ao's desires.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Some sects within the Cult of Ao thought it their responsibility to be involved in the affairs of other faiths. By overseeing them, the Aoists ensured that the bounds of a deity's portfolios were respected, and the portfolio itself was actively promoted. Nevertheless, this was not the priority of the entire cult—especially not the Waterdhavian branch.</p>
<p>Mostly, the cult's cells occupied themselves with discoursing about a variety of important questions. Ao's existence and its implications were a favored topic of discussion amongst the Aoists, and so too was the possibility that the Hidden One, himself, worshiped something greater. Debate regarding the words spoken publicly by Lord Ao, during his first and final speech, was another fundamental question. More grandiose was the one of the world's own origin: who made it, if Ao considered only the gods as his creations?</p>
<h2>Celebrations</h2>
<p>Though celebrated by all throughout Waterdeep, the 15 th of Marpenoth was an especially holy day for the local Cult of Ao. Known by the citizenry as Gods' Day , it was held to commemorate the resolution of the Avatar Crisis —the very same day that the Hidden One first made himself known to the people of Faerûn. As part of the festivities, Ao's cultists sponsored a revel in the Cynosure, lasting the entire day. That same evening, they punctuated the event with a solemn prayer.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>In Waterdeep, the Aoists built and were headquartered in the Temple of the Overgod Ao . When the building's original namesake made his distant nature clear, though, the subsequent loss of followers precipitated the loss of the cult's own temple. The building was bought by the city's rulers, the Lords of Waterdeep , and renamed the Cynosure; it soon became a space for civic gathering, and was, sometimes, even rented out for public events.</p>
<p>Without the Temple of the Overgod, the remaining Waterdhavian cultists were forced to meet elsewhere and in secret, with taprooms and cellars becoming their most common meeting places. Infrequently, their clandestine meetings took place within the Cynosure or even the Plinth , the latter being a temple open to all faiths.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The Cult of Ao lacked many of the accoutrements common to other clergies, holy symbol included. So meager were their assets that, when not engaged in ceremony, there was little way to identify an Aoist from any other individual, for even their ministers simply outfitted themselves in accordance with their quotidian occupations, the weather, or the fashions at the time.</p>
<p>If it came time to put on their liturgical vestments, however, the cult was prepared. In such a case, the ministers of Ao preferred a two-tone aesthetic, wearing a white shirt atop black pants—all subsumed under a long, broad robe . Resembling the one worn by their Lord's avatar , this last piece was black in color and speckled with star-like sequins or white dots.</p>
<h2>Classes</h2>
<p>The cultists of Ao accepted any amongst their ranks, from barbarians to wizards . The most exceptional among them became known as ministers, equivalent to the priests of other faiths—who, themselves, were the only ones prevented from becoming ministers of Ao. Regardless, it was a meaningless effort, for no true Aoist priests existed. Given that the Hidden One's neglected worshipers were never provided with magic or similarly unique abilities, any member of the clergy who showed such aptitudes likely sourced them from a magic item or an intruding deity, as with Cyric and the Tethyrian cultists.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Despite the regulatory dynamic between the Aoists and the other Faerûnian clergies, there was little hostility from the latter towards the former—largely due to the cult's lack of authority. Other deities informed their most faithful that Ao never associated himself with mortals. Therefore, because his worshipers operated without their Lord's true support, they were considered no threat at all, not even needing to be spoken out against.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Spawned in the aftermath of the Time of Troubles of the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , countless people flocked together, eager to worship an Overgod—but they summarily deserted the faith soon after. This apostasy was caused by the fact that their Lord Ao ignored his clergy en masse , never blessing them with the Power or answering their prayers.</p>
<p>Once the novelty wore thin, the Cult of Ao was drastically reduced in number and largely split into regional sects. The largest and most notable amongst these was a cult based in Waterdeep, the great City of Splendors, as much of its citizenry had heard Ao himself at the end of the Godswar. This particular cell that took upon itself the duty of overseeing other, more prominent, churches, and so propagating the decrees of the Hidden One.</p>
<p>Unpopular as they were, the various cults of Ao eked out a dwindling existence by 1372 DR , nearly fifteen years after they first formed. The faith was truly dead by 1479 DR . After the Spellplague and the tumultuous century that followed, none alive still worshiped him and any who professed to be a priest of the Hidden One was dishonest. By then, cults of Ao were borne only of misunderstood myths, parting ways soon after.</p>
