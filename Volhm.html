<p>Volhm , the Gentle Lady of Palter, was a Netherese arcanist who specialized in developing lightning-based spells .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Gentle Lady was an eminent arcanist, mostly because of the famous spell she created: lightning bolt . Several other arcanists, and even archwizards , paid a visit to her to acquire it. Having an interest in elven culture and expanding her repertoire of spells, she would only trade knowledge of how to cast lightning bolt in exchange for elven antiques or spells she had no knowledge of.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Volhm was born in 1848 NY (−2011 DR) . The renowned mage lived in Palter , and invented spells such as shocking grasp , lightning bolt , energy drain , and finally, chain lightning . Three years after she invented her final spell, her lightning bolt spell still proved very popular. For this reason, she was sought out by Jarm , a rival arcanist. The two engaged in a spell duel to the death in 1898 NY (−1961 DR) , Volhm was beaten, and Jarm claimed victory. In response, her chaotic students attacked the victor, but all of them were slain by the adroit Jarm.</p>
