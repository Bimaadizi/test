<p>Vargo was a skull lord from Acheron who arrived in the Sea of Swords in the late 15 th century DR . There, it ruled a cube-shaped island from its Six Face Throne and commanded an army of creatures infected by the rapidly-spreading pixelating curse .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Vargo was an imposing three-headed skeletal figure, and it had modified its body to have space for an additional three heads. One of its heads could only babble, and used a straw to suck from a flask that was tied around Vargo's neck. The flask was filled with water from the Styx, and kept the skull lord free of the pixelating curse, at the cost of affecting the intelligence of its third head.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Vargo had one personality that was a combination of those of the three creatures that had once been its head. It was a strong leader; cunning and deceptive. It often mixed truth with lies to more easily manipulate those it wanted to. It was egotistical and unemotional. New heads, unless particularly strong-willed, would be completely dominated by Vargo. Each of its heads wrote in a different style of handwriting.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>By using the Six-Face-Throne, Vargo had the power to control all the creatures affected by the pixelating curse , as well as control all doors and orientation of Cube 1717. Vargo had discovered a method to attach new heads to its body, which would let it increase in power. While one of its heads was stupefied by the water of the Styx, Vargo was somewhat weakened and lost access to its most powerful spell - finger of death . However, it retained the ability to cast other spells such as eyebite and cloudkill .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Vargo owned the Six-Face Throne , a powerful device that it built from the body of the Archquadrone that had originally started the pixelating curse. The Throne had spaces for six heads to control it and Vargo used it to control Cube 1717. However, the Throne could only access the full power of Cube 1717 when it was piloted by a complete set of six heads. Due to one of Vargo's heads being stupefied by the Styx water, Vargo was only able to control two sides of the Throne. Vargo had its second-in-command Sladek operate the third side.</p>
<p>Around its neck, Vargo kept a key to its treasury, and to its chambers. Vargo was attuned to a set of six Ioun stones which it had taken from Sladek. They increased its awareness, wisdom, intelligence, proficiency, defenses, and stored spells for it.</p>
<p>In its chambers, Vargo kept the head of Andromalius, the previous ruler of Cube 1717. The head had become was rotted and pixelated. There was also a sarcophagus made from black steel and lined with red velvet . The chambers were decorated with three sets of items - three tables, three cups. It also owned sixty bottles of expensive wine , a pouch of torpor poison and a spell scroll of dimension door .</p>
<p>Vargo was very wealthy. In its treasury, Vargo stored thousands of coins of various denominations, and many urns of gems . The treasury also contained a 500 lb (230 kg) red brazier carved in the shape of a devil 's head; and many magic items such as a helm of teleportation , a Horn of Valhalla , and a set of mariner's armor .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Vargo wished to sever the heads of intelligent individuals and attach them to its own body. It planned to aquire three more skulls, giving it the six necessary to pilot Cube 1717 at full power with the Six-Face Throne. It lured adventurers to the Changing Island in the Sea of Swords , which was truly Cube 1717, hoping to take their heads. Its goal was to conquer all of Faerûn by attacking and pixelating the Sword Coast with a fully powered Cube 1717.</p>
<p>Vargo spent most of its time in its personal chamber of Cube 1717.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>As the controller of the Six-Faced-Throne, Vargo was in control of all creatures affected by the pixelating curse. Although, they secretly distrusted the skull lord, because it itself was not pixelated like they were. Sladek's forces included pixelated merregons , souls from acheron, and sailors who had discoverd Cube 1717; as well as many pixelated zombies and skeletons . Vargo always kept its two pixelated bodyguards with it: Astilbe the shadar-kai and a merregon . A notable pixelated creature was Sladek , a genasi who served as second-in-command and controlled one side of the Six-Face Throne.</p>
<p>Vargo was also served by some nonpixelated creatures: Avnas , the derro architect who originally designed Cube 1717 ; and Simak , a drow who Vargo kept to entertain itself; and Bunch the berbalang . In exchange for bones, Bunch monitored Cube 1717 for any visitors, looking for creatures intelligent enough for Vargo to take their skulls as new heads. Malika Tahoun was a non-pixelated oinoloth who also served Vargo. She originally came to Toril to destroy Cube 1717. But joined forces with Vargo when it threatened her life. Vargo planned to use her head in the Six-Face Throne , although it hoped to find others.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Vargo was originally a trio of three evil adventurers . They joined forces to depose Earl Andromalius , who ruled Cube 1717 in Acheron . But their plot failed, and each of them was charged with sedition, then their heads were cut off and merged together. The three were brought back to life as one being - a skull lord.</p>
<p>The newly-combined Vargo was imprisoned in an oubliette of Cube 1717's prison complex to serve one million life sentences. Hundreds of years later, as the pixelating curse took hold in Cube 1717, Andromalius was killed and replaced by the Archquadrone . The pixelated soldiers freed the prisoners of Cube 1717, including Vargo. In order to prevent the pixelating curse, the rulers of Acheron struck a bargain with yugoloths to drown Cube 1717 in the Styx . Followers of the Archquadrone desperately sent Cube 1717 to the material plane in an escape. The cube crashed deep into the Sea of Swords on Toril , surrounded by a small sea of potent water from the Stx.</p>
<p>Vargo found the Archquadrone dying, and made it into the Six-Face Throne . As the master of the Six-Face Throne, Vargo assumed control of Cube 1717. Vargo encountered Avnas the derro , who had been hiding in Cube 1717. It made her swear fealty to it. It tasked her with creating a plumbing system that converted the Styx water that surrounded the cube into mist which kept parts of the cube free of pixelation.</p>
<p>A trireme captained by drow from the underdark came to Cube 1717. The drow had heard of the cube's fall and wanted to use it as a weapon. Vargo attacked the drow, and attemped to take the head of their high priestess, but she killed herself to prevent this. The only survivor was Simak , the captain of the ship. She was secretly protected by her amulet of the styx , but pretended to be stupified by the Styx water.</p>
<p>Cube 1717 was sighted by sailors, who named it the Changing Island. Sladek, a genasi mage, sailed to the island to investigate. He was promptly pixelated by the curse and entered service to Vargo. Not knowing what had happened to Sladek, a diviner named Saberhagen from the Sword Coast, hired adventurers to visit the island and track down the missing genasi. The adventurers sailed to the island, joined by a monodrone . Once they reached Cube 1717, they fought Vargo and the pixelating curse. Vargo was very interested in these adventurers' heads.</p>
