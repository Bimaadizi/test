<p>The Teshford Arms was run by Olavia Tsardruyn and was the only real inn in Dagger Falls .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>When the weather was good enough for prospecting, traders from various places around the Moonsea and Dragon Reach took up residence here and bought gems that miners brought out of the Desertsmouth Mountains .</p>
<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>The inn suffered from the fact that Olavia's mint wine was the only thing to recommend it. There were reports that it improved after the Zhent occupation in 1369 DR , but was rarely full.</p>
