<p>Radoc , also known as "The One" and Doc of New Empyrea , was a powerful archmage and cleric from another world dwelling in the Star Mounts deep in the High Forest in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was a mysterious and charismatic figure.</p>
<p>His faith was that of Tangg, an other-planar power .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was an old man. On his forehead, he had a glowing sigil, said to have been put there by the titan Sylla. It could be seen at all times, whatever make-up, disguise, or magic was used to hide it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>For reasons unknown, Doc was exiled from another Prime Material plane , called New Empyrea, to the world of Toril . There, he adopted the name "Radoc".</p>
<p>Radoc's goal was to return to his home plane and become the master of New Empyrea. Over the course of nearly twenty years, he built a power base in the remote Star Mounts, using tribes of mongrelmen for muscle while purchasing all of the mithril that the orcs of the Spine of the World could mine. He also gathered other, more monstrous creatures to his side, even a deepspawn , allowing him to produce even more mongrelmen as well as trolls and others. Over time, he had amassed almost 75 mongrelmen, organizing them into a significant force in the High Forest, and even brought solidarity and leadership to them and other so-called monsters in the High Forest. Outsiders had little idea what he did in the Star Mounts.</p>
<p>In Eleasis of the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Radoc aided victims of an orc raid and took them to Loudwater , where he was seen as a great healer and cleric and he made allies there. Radoc declined to answer any questions and bought some supplies in exchange for clear, sparkling crystals before he departed.</p>
<p>In the summer of the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR , Radoc and his gathered forces were last seen leaving the Star Mounts, as rumors circulated that he had finally obtained enough power to transport them to an unknown destination. Rumors continued to circulate regarding his whereabouts, with some saying he had gone to the Fallen Lands to gather more followers and others speculating that they had all died on a battlefield on another plane . No-one knew where they were, only that they were no longer in the High Forest. By 1370 DR , their fate remained unknown, and but a few mongrelmen remained in the forest.</p>
<p>His true fate was known only to the inhabitants of Hellgate Keep - having heard about the death of the Keep's ruler, Radoc had decided to lead his monstrous army out of the Fallen Lands and on an assault against the demon -infested fortress in the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR . His forces made significant headway, tearing through the demons and their undead minions and damaging the main gates and walls. Both sides suffered heavy losses, but finally the demons tore and hurled chunks of masonry off their battlements, crushing both Radoc and his siege engines . The remaining forces of the mad wizard fled the battlefield, scattering back into the Fallen Lands and into the Far Forest and Nether Mountains , while the deepspawn remained in Hellgate Keep's Deep Tunnels.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He had no known enemies. In fact, Radoc considered Grintharke , the former balor ruler of Hellgate Keep, to be one of his great foes.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Radoc was known to wear bracers of defense , a cloak of protection , a ring of fire resistance , and a ring of protection . He fought with a +4 mace that doubled as a wand of lightning bolts .</p>
