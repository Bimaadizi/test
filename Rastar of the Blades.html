<p>Rastar of the Blades was a retired from adventuring rogue who settled in the small town of Ravilar's Cloak in Turmish .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Rastar of the Blades hailed from Calimshan . Circa the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , the rogue claimed a home in Ravilar's Cloak that once belonged to a merchant named Alataz Thrindol . Alataz has been absent from the Cloak for seven years, his fate unclear. Shortly after Rastar's arrival, the locals started whispering of strange occurrences around the recently abandoned house. To make the house's mystery even more prominent, residents of Ravilar's Cloak witnessed gargoyle flying above the building on dark and moonless nights.</p>
