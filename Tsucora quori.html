<p>Tsucora quori ( pl : Tsucoras ) were nightmarish quori , a type of aberration native to Dal Quor , a plane of dreams associated with the world of Eberron . They were among the weakest and most numerous of the quori, but no less formidable.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like other quori, tsucoras were the embodiments of dreams. They had elongated, serpentine bodies, the headless torsos of which were covered with a multitude of eyes and grasping limbs. Tsucoras had two massive arms ending in vicious-looking pincers, while their tails ended in a sharp stinger.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Tsucora quori were natural schemers and master manipulators, who excelled at playing on the fears and doubts of mortals. They were constantly making cruel and elaborate plans to increase their own station among the quori. They enjoyed power as a means to itself. When not serving the greater purpose of the quori, tsucoras spent their time hunting the dream-spirits of sleeping mortals.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Tsucoras had the ability to possess the bodies of humanoids , taking control of a host body while keeping their victim aware yet powerless to act. They also possessed some minor psionic ability, allowing them to innately cast spells like fear and charm person . Other innate psionic-like abilities possessed by the tsucoras included body adjustment , body equilibrium , far hand , id insinuation , inertial armor , mindlink , psionic charm , psionic scent , and recall agony .</p>
<p>They were slightly resistant to harm from acid , cold, and fire -based attacks. Tsucoras could also see in areas of total darkness , communicate telepathically, and were typically gifted in the arts of autohypnosis and psicraft .</p>
<p>Any creature struck by the stinger of tsucora would begin to perceive some nightmarish phantasm attacking them, as though they were under the effects of the phantasmal killer spell.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Beyond their psionic abilities, tsucoras were partial to attacking their enemies with their pincers and stinger.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the winter of the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , a tsucora quori arrived on Toril as one of many captive creatures within the crashed nautiloid Id Ascendant .</p>
