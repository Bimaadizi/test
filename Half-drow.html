<p>A half-drow was a descendant of both human and drow ancestries. A half-drow generally had dusky skin, silver or white hair, and human eye colors. They could see around 60 feet (18 meters) with darkvision , but otherwise had no other known drow traits or abilities. There is at least one known case of an individual who was half-drow and half-orc, instead of half-human.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Half-drow were most commonly encountered in Dambrath and in the Underdark . House Ousstyl , in particular, was known for having mated with humans .</p>
<p>Half-drow were often conceived in bleak circumstance and usually by slaves . However, half-drow could also be the product of consenting parents. Dambrath was founded by such pairings when one hundred and twelve half-elven priestesses of Loviatar and male drow stock from T'lindhet interbred. The half-drow ruling caste there were known as the Crinti and were a mixture of those priestesses, their descendants, and the conquered Arkaiun people.</p>
<p>Outside of Dambrath most half-drow were products of solitary encounters - be they unfortunate or good.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>The Crinti of Dambrath were by birth an aristocratic ruling caste and so tended to be an arrogant, proud people who saw themselves as superior to the humans they ruled over. Much like their pure cousins in T'lindhet there existed a drive for Dambrathan half-drow to prove themselves to their families and houses - often leading to their premature deaths in politicking or by seeking out adventure as a means of proving themselves.</p>
<p>Half-drow of other origins seek out adventure as a way to escape bigotry and suspicion, to prove themselves, or to find freedom from the societies that look upon them unfavorably.</p>
<p>Most peoples saw them much in the same light as drow regardless of their dispositions and much to the frustration and shame to the Crinti of Dambrath they found that drow especially regarded them as inferior at best and abominable at least.</p>
<p>An example of this being Xandra Shobalar who encountered a merchant in Mantol-Derith , ostensibly human, who was in fact half-drow. Perhaps indicative of the drow view of such things, she found his suspected nature to be appalling.</p>
<h2>Religion</h2>
<p>Half-drow tended to worship the Spider Queen , the other deities of the Dark Seldarine , and other reprehensible powers like fiends or evil deities among the Faerunian pantheon .</p>
<p>Some good aligned half-drow who made their way to Aglarond , worshiped Eilistraee . Though that goddess was also worshiped quietly by some in Dambrath as well - those tired of the evil of Lolth and Loviatar.</p>
