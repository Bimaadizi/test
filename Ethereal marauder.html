<p>An ethereal marauder was a predatory monster from the Ethereal Plane .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Marauders resemble blue or purple two-legged lizards with long, flexible tails. Having no neck to speak of, their massive mouth with its three mandibles was attached directly to the creature's body. The mouth was lined with black teeth. Between each pair of mandibles were one of its three tiny eyes.</p>
<p>Marauders on average grew to stand 4 feet (1.2 meters) tall and 7 feet (2.1 meters), though some specimens could reaches sizes double that. They typically weighed around 200 pounds (91 kilograms).</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>The native behavior of ethereal marauders on their home plane was not well-known. Their forays into the Prime Material Plane occurred when they were hunting prey. They had no society or culture but behaved more similarly to natural wild animals.</p>
<p>Survivors of their attacks claimed that they made an "eerie whine," which varied in pitch depending on the monster's speed and condition</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Marauders had the magical ability to shift from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane and back again, much like the spell ethereal jaunt . They would use this innate ability to ambush prey, snapping into existence, biting with their razor teeth, and retreating into etherealness.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1372 DR , the famous ranger Drizzt Do'Urden and his companions were attacked by a rare cluster of overgrown ethereal marauders, while investigating the ruins of the dwarven and Orcish town of Baffenburg . Whatever catastrophe destroyed the town was thought to have weakened the planar barriers between the Material and Ethereal Planes, which was why the marauders were roaming there.</p>
<p>Some time in the 14 th century DR , a ethereal marauder took up residence in the abandoned Moon Tower of Elembar .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>These creatures usually hunted alone.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Nilshai , sorcerers of the same plane, were said to keep ethereal marauders as guardians.</p>
