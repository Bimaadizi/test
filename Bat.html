<p>Bats were a group of wild, flying animals of generally small size that fed on other small mammals, insects , reptiles , or fruit. Although the majority of bats were small, a few larger varieties existed. Bats were almost all nocturnal.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Most bats were roughly the size of a small bird although larger bats existed. All bats were adept at perceiving their surroundings in the dark though the precise mechanics differed by species, with most bats using a form of blindsight involving sound —or darkvision in the case of shadowhunter bats .</p>
<h2>Species</h2>
<p>There were many varieties of unusual bat species, some of which are listed below:</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Beyond the Prime Material plane , bats could be found in the Domains of Dread and some claimed that they were more numerous there than in any other plane of existence. Bats also inhabited the caverns of the Blood Tor , the Abyssal realms of Beshaba and Umberlee .</p>
<h3>Usages</h3>
<p>Some magic stores were known to sell the fur and guano of bats as a sort of material component , both at a price of 10 gp per 1 oz (28 g). Spells that required a bit of bat fur to cast included arcane eye , darkness , and the illusionist version of continual darkness . Those that required a bit of bat guano to cast included fireball , delayed blast fireball , Darsson's fiery cube , and explosive cascade .</p>
<p>Circa 1365 DR , the owner of the restaurant Maid of the Moors in Mornbryn's Shield , Beldora Thiiruin kept pet bats she allowed to freely fly around the dining hall, using the flying critters as a means of pest control.</p>
<p>Halfling kids often fished for bats using a light, durable twine string, and bait of live moths .</p>
