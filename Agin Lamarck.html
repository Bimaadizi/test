<p>Ser Agin Lamarck was a nobleman and historian at Mantor's Library in Phlan during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He had a thin face framed by long black hair and illuminated by penetrating emerald eyes.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Agin was a pessimistic and sardonic individual that was not particularly easy to like. He acted like the consumate spoiled nobleman that were so-often found throughout the Realms. The personality developed was nothing but fa√ßade, created to protect his secret: his family's claim to nobility was false, as his grandmother had altered their genealogies in order to claim descent from the deceased House Lamarck .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The discerning nobleman wore the finest clothes befitting a man of his social stature. He decorated himself many over-the-top rings, one of which was associated with the Lords' Alliance of the Sword Coast .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>His passion was detailing all the genealogies of the families of Phlan. During the day however, he worked in a shop in Podol's Plaza .</p>
<p>Agin was a secret member of Lords' Alliance, an organization that normally did not tolerate deception amongst its members.</p>
