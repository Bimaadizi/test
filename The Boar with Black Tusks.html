<p>The Boar with Black Tusks was the most noteworthy inn of the village of Noanar's Hold in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>It was a stout, but long log building, stretched over rolling hills. It sat beneath the shade of old, sturdy shadowtops .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The overall conditions of the Boar were relatively the same as the other inns of Noanar's Hold. Its rooms included a common dining room, a bar, a kitchen, a bathing area, and a total of forty two guest rooms.</p>
<p>Much of the floors were furnished in worn rugs to keep one's feet warm, some of which looked to be old tapestries depicting northern hunting scenes that had been unfortunately cut up in order to make the tapestries fit into the hallways. The furniture, though stout and comfortable, were an eclectic mixture.</p>
<p>The Boar's well known steamy bathes were unisex and numbered five in total, with three being hot water baths and two being cool water baths. These baths were all made of copper , sunk into the floor, and had seat ledges inside of them to allow up to eight guests to sit comfortably. On any given day, at least one of the hot baths usually had scented oils available.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The Boar's interior offered a rather cozy atmosphere. The services of its housemaids were notably courteous and timely.</p>
<p>The tremendous meals the inn offered often left diners falling asleep in the common dining roam, groaning over the quantity of food consumed, or staggering to their bedrooms for rest.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>A night at one of the Boar's guest rooms cost 4 gold pieces , with that payment also covering the guest's bath, meal, stabling, and one use of the inn's clothes-mending & laundry service. Choosing to forgo these amenities would not yield a discount. The inn offered no tenday staying rate. Feed for stabled creatures carried a separate 5 copper piece charge per mount . Additional uses of the inn's clothes-mending & laundry service cost a stiff 1 to 3 gp per garment. And food was not allowed to be taken into the guest rooms.</p>
<p>The inn kept a number of outer-clothes on stock to loan out to guests in cases when their clothing were either drying after a hunt or inappropriate for hunting. These included high boots , warm woollen overtunics , and weather-cloaks . Additionally, the Boar's many housemaids offered escort services , typically charging around 40 to 60 gp for a night of company.</p>
<p>The Boar's provender was identical to those of the other inns of Noanar's Hold. For those not staying at the inn, a meal cost a flat rate of 4 gp. For guests their meal included a carafe or pitcher of whatever drink the guest preferred. Additional drinks cost either 1 silver piece , if the desired drinking vessel was a glass or tankard , or 1 gp if the container was a bottle .</p>
<p>The meals on offer were always wild game, accompanied by cheese , pots of smoked and spiced river fish , and round loaves of hard, black nutbread . These salty fish mixtures ground together a variety of different fish that were old and gave off a strong odor. While the wild game on offer could vary day to day, courses usually followed a set pattern.</p>
<p>The first course of a meal was always fowl, accompanied by cabbage and some other greens. This would be followed by some form of small bodied local game, such as a fox , rabbit , or ground rodent. This typically was either cooked in a red wine or served with a white sauce. The third course was always some type of unusual game, like a beaver , wolf , or even manticore . This was followed by the primary meats of the meal, which were either bear , elk , or owlbear . The meal would at last be concluded with some form of jellies – of the flavors cranberry , mint , and sloeberry – a whole roasted boar , whose tusks were painted black in emulation of the inn's name, and steaming trays of meat that had been cooked in a thick gravy derived from the drippings of all the prior meals that the kitchen had prepared.</p>
<p>For diners on the go, the inn offered sack luncheons for 3 gp a piece. These consisted of a cold version of the eveningfeast, wrapped up in some pieces of old cloth and stuck inside a canvas sack.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The inn had a strict ban on all manner of spellcasting . Anyone caught breaking this prohibition would be kicked out. This rule ostensibly existed for the purposes of preventing fires and other mayhem from unfolding in the Boar.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When travel writer Volothamp Geddarm had a brief visit to Noanar's Hold in 1365 DR , The Boar was the only inn of the hold's four that he had time to take in and commit his thoughts to in Volo's Guide to the North . Within the confines of that book , Volo would relay that Elminster had confirmed the Boar's infamous legend and his claim that the tale's anonymous mage was in fact one of the Hunt Lords.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The Boar was famous for a grisly legend surrounding it, that told of a visiting adventurer who recognized one of their fellow guests as a former colleague and wizard that owed him coins . The man got confrontational, demanding the payment he was owed for quite some time. The guest responded by using spells to paralyze and polymorph the aggressor into a boar . The tale concluded with the guest having the polymorphed aggressor cooked and served at the end of the inn's evening meal in place of another boar.</p>
<p>Additionally, there were rumors that the Boar's various furnishings originated from a number of old, over-grown keeps across the High Forest , built by wizard lords in the immediate centuries following the Netherese Empire 's fall. Some of these stories further talk of hidden treasure from those old keeps, tucked away in vaults beneath trapdoors or accessible only by secret passageways in certain rooms. These treasures were mostly said to be strange magical items that struck fear in their scavengers. By and large, these rumors were primarily spoken of in the city of Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Boar, like the rest of Noanar's Hold's inns, was collectively owned by the Horn Lords , a council of wizards that ruled over the village. Many, including visitor Volothamp Geddarm, suspected that the true purpose of their prohibition on spellcasting was to ensure that the Horn Lords didn't have to worry about opposition. The housemaids that worked in the Boar were likewise employees of all four inns, divvying their time between them.</p>
