<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These boots allowed the wearer to move more silently and hide with greater ease.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These boots were worn by the royal spies of King Rhigaerd II , who ruled Cormyr during the late 13 th and early 14 th centuries DR . The spies were renowned throughout the kingdom and beyond for their tremendous skill in their craft. Eventually the order of spies were betrayed from within, and the tools of their trade, including numerous pairs of these boots were dispersed across the Realms.</p>
<p>One such pair of magic boots was worn by Purvis , the assassin who was hired by the speaker of Lonelywood in the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR .</p>
<p>One set of worn whispers came into the possession of the thief Zhurlong sometime before the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR . He then proceeded to lose them to some hobgoblins just south of Beregost .</p>
<p>Another pair had been recovered by one of the guildmasters of the Shadow Thieves , Mae'Var of Athkatla .</p>
<p>Yet another pair were claimed by Samuel Thunderburp a bartender who also resided within Athkatla.</p>
