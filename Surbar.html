<p>Surbar was a coastal city of Ulgarth in southeast Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Surbar was sheltered safely within the bay of the Golden Water . It stood on the coast, southwest of the Galuil Mountains . Sunrise in springtime made the Mountains of Gold a beautiful sight.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Around 1367 DR , Surbar and its environs were governed by Baron Kasnchil . He was corrupt and greedy, yet the serfs thought he made the city prosper.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Surbar received most of the gold and iron mined from the mountains. Metalworking, weapon -smithing, shipping, and spices were Surbar's primary industries. Baron Kasnchil's policy of accepting all kinds of trade through Surbar made it a popular port and a prosperous city, but this knew no limits: even Dambrathan pirates could dock there to resupply and refit.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Surbar was home to nearly 15,000 people, making it the second-largest city in Ulgarth. More than anywhere else in the kingdom, demihumans were common here, thanks to the dwarven mining trade from the mountains.</p>
