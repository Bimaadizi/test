<p>Khuralosothantar , or in short Khuralos , was a bronze dragon in Seros .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Born in 612 DR , Khuralos laired within the slopes of Mount Halaath . On a few occasions, the dukars of Myth Nantar asked his counsel but most of the time he slept.</p>
<p>He was awakened by the catastrophic end of the Twelfth Serôs War . He kept an eye on the situation, especially in Myth Nantar, quietly eliminating some sahuagin groups.</p>
<p>In 1370 DR , Khuralos was pondering what was the best way to help, as did the city's paragons that knew of his presence.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Khuralos loved to eat sahuagin for the challenge of eating something that could fight back. He was a curious and amiable dragon but sometimes his curiosity overcame him and Khuralos "borrowed" interesting things.</p>
