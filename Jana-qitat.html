<p>The jana-qitat , also called lesser winged cats or fluttercats , were smaller cousins of the jana-nimr . They were usually found within cities.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These creatures looked like house cats that sported a pair of wings from their back. The color of their fur varied greatly, though medium brown with a dark face, paws, wings and tail was the rarest coloration.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Similar to their larger cousins, these cats only attacked if threatened, flying through the air attempting to rake their targets. Mothers fiercely defended their young.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>An enclosed lair above ground was the preferred nest of a jana-qitat . They bore litters of 1â€“3 cubs who lived with the mother for several months before they learned how to fly. Jana-qitat had a lifespan of 20 years.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Fluttercats controlled the vermin population wherever they lived. They were prized as pets and were quite loving toward a master who cared for them. Lucky wizards were known to have a fluttercat as a familiar .</p>
