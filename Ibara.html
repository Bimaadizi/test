<p>Ibara was a village located in Miyama Province in Kozakura .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ibara was situated near the shores of Nora-ko .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Despite being located on Nora-ko, the village primarily engaged in farming rather than fishing. The notorious and ominous reputation of Nora-ko has deterred all but the most daring or reckless villagers from venturing onto its waters. This apprehension has effectively isolated Ibara, turning it into a tranquil, somewhat secluded community.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>As of Kozakuran Year 1430 (1356 DR) , the village's myoshu was Gobo . The village's calm demeanor was well-suited to Gobo, who harbored a secret identity as a cat hengeyokai and was also a wu jen . While the villagers had their suspicions about Gobo's true nature, there was no open hostility towards him, largely due to the significant influence and control he wielded over their lives. Gobo's rule was characterized by tyranny and impulsiveness, and he often made harsh demands of the hyakusho under his authority. The villagers' fear of his mysterious powers kept them compliant and in check.</p>
