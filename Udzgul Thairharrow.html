<p>Udzgul Thairharrow was a farmer in the village of Maskyr's Eye in the Vast in the late 13 th or early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was considered to be half-witted.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the folk of Maskyr's Vale came to investigate the collapse of old Maskyr's Tower , Udzgul claimed to have spotted a silvery doorway appearing for an instant in the air high over the ruins at sunset, but no-one believed him because they thought him a half-wit. Some others reported the same thing later, but they too were dismissed. Despite this, Khonduil Ammargath , who'd been in the tower when it fell, felt Udzgul was likely to have been right in what he saw.</p>
<p>Udzgul was deceased by the late 1350s DR.</p>
