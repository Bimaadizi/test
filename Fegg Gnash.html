<p>Fegg Gnash was a bloodforge commander who operated out of the Realm of Fire in the Utter East during the time of the Bloodforge Wars ( 648 â€“ 657 DR ).</p>
<p>From this domain, Fegg Gnash raided the surface lands, forcing peasants to flee their homes in fear of the rumblings in the earth. Coming across a group of refugees, the commander of the Legendary Campaign (which sought to unify the wartorn Utter East through conquest) ventured into the Realm of Fire to put a stop to it in a bloodforge battle.</p>
