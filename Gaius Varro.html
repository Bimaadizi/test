<p>Gaius Varro was the Lord Marshal of Ravens Bluff in the 1350s DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Standing 6 ft 4 in (1.9 m) tall and weighing 310 lb (140 kg), Gaius was easily the most recognizable man in the city. His uniform was ornately decorated with medals and gold braid, he had flowing white hair, and carried a gilded mace as the symbol of his office.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Gaius's loyalty and dedication to Ravens Bluff were unquestioned, but he tended to be very conservative in all matters public and military. Some speculated that age and poor health had made him this way and as a result he had limited effectiveness. He usually spoke lucidly and concisely as he invariably proposed a defensive strategy. If challenged, he grew indignant and cited sources in too much detail, wearing his critics down with verbiage. However, he was not one to hold a grudge and would throw a banquet to make amends. To his troops, he is a strict disciplinarian and intolerant of careless or slovenly soldiers.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Gaius possessed a bronze horn of Valhalla and a ring of spell storing .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gaius Varro was exiled from the Dalelands by Lashan Aumersair of Scardale around 1355 DR and was hired by Lord Mayor Charles Oliver O'Kane of Ravens Bluff because of Varro's reputation. Although Gaius Varro had been a professional soldier for all of his adult life, he had not led an army in fifteen years at the time of his move to Ravens Bluff . He was still Lord Marshal around 1356 DR .</p>
