<h2>History</h2>
<p>Agnes Shveitz was a woman who was murdered, presumably being one of the many victims of the Cult of Bhaal , in or shortly before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . She was survived by her wife, Droona Shveitz – a gold dwarf . Agnes was buried in the Lower City Graveyard , next to the Hhune Mausoleum . The gravestone was etched with a single inscription: "Beloved Agnes Shveitz. Her smile shined like a thousand suns." In 1492 DR, Agnes's wife, Droona, could often be seen mourning at the gravestone. However, her grave may had been accidentally desecrated, and the woman's body – risen as a zombie by Nina Dortmell , a talented child with the gift , who was trying to resurrect her recently deceased brother.</p>
