<p>The Galleon Nebula was a large nebula in Realmspace . It appeared like a multicolored galleon ship. In the mid-14 th century DR , it was visible from Toril during autumn and early winter.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Galleon was a huge multicolored cloud about 2 million miles (3.2 million km) long and tall and over 100,000 miles (160,000 km) wide.</p>
<p>It orbited the Torilian solar system in a very slow orbit, taking over 4,000 months to complete a full revolution. The nebula shared its orbit with the Color Spray Nebula , but in the opposite position, so the two were never simultaneously visible from Toril.</p>
<p>The entire nebula was a wild magic region that wreaked havoc on spelljammer ships. It caused ships' gravity planes to shift quickly and unpredictably and caused magic items on board to buzz in a deafening tone. Once the ships left the nebula, these effects immediately ceased.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Astrologers from Toril believed that the nebula had been placed in the sky by the deities of magic , both as a sign informing the inhabitants of Toril of the existence of spelljamming technology and as a sign of their blessing for its use. On the other hand, more isolationist astrologers believed that the nebula's wild magic properties served as a warning about the dangers of space travel.</p>
