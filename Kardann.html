<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1361 DR, Kardann was assigned to the Golden Legion for their Maztican expedition. He was tasked with safeguarding Amnian interests during the journey.</p>
<p>Soon after the battle near Payit , he conspired with some legionaries to return to Faerûn in order to secure the first partition of gold . In order to stop Kardann's plot and avoid more complications, Cordell decided to burn the ships.</p>
<p>Kardann was disliked by most of the legionaries.</p>
<p>His only other action of note occurred during the Legion's stop in Nexal , when he found the lost gold treasure of Axalt .</p>
<p>He quickly betrayed Cordell to side with Don Vaez , saying that it was the best interests of Amn, but in truth for the promise to sail back to Faerûn . When Cordell regained control of Helmsport Kardann escaped alone in the jungle. At last while in the jungle he met a very hungry jaguar lord in search of food.</p>
