<p>General Labak Craumerdaun was the commander of the Council Army garrison in Eshpurta and overseer of much of the military operations in Amn. He also held an advisory position with the ruling body of Eshpurta, the Shield Council .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Labak had a forceful, take-charge personality and strong desire to get what was best for his troops.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Craumerdaun family was highly influential in Eshpurta, with Labak's uncle Lord Marcos Craumerdaun on the Shield Council. Vimal Craumerdaun was the family's accountant in the city, and a secret wizard . His personal protégé was Colonel Gladdos Wintosnip , one of the finest officers in the army.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>General Labak was responsible for Amn's military in eastern Amn, and handled the deployments and postings of soldiers and officers.</p>
<p>Labak often got what he wanted out of the Shield Council, most of whom did not want to lose favor with the commander-in-chief of the 18,000 troops within the city walls. He also had great influence and informally controlled the Shield Militia of the city.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>General Labak was called repeatedly over seven years by Captain Arbas Rosznar to inspect Hillfort Keshla —an attempt by Arbas to impress the general and get redeployed somewhere else. The general finally agreed to perform an inspection on Midsummer of 1370 DR , but this was put off by the impending invasion of Riatavin that year. Labak joined the troops in mustering at Hillfort Keshla, but on Eleint 14 , the day they were supposed to embark, messengers arrived with news of the Sothillisian War and the fall of Esmeltaran .</p>
<p>General Craumerdaun immediately took half of the assembled troops and marched to retake Esmeltaran, but the battle on Eleint 21 against the Skullgnasher hill giants and Spearbiter goblins was a catastrophe. With the aid of the traitorous Captain Amlos Xornnag and the city's captured armories, the entrenched giants and goblins managed to kill half of all of Craumerdaun's troops in the initial battle. The Council Army was forced to retreat and engage in a long siege on the city, using the Scimitar as a base camp.</p>
<p>The siege lasted until the autumn of 1372 DR , when Selûnite crusaders recaptured the Small Teeth pass near Imnescar and cut off the defenders of the city. With the giants and goblins trapped, the Council Army was finally able to retake Esmeltaran and make progress in the war.</p>
