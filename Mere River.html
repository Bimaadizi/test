<p>The Mere River was a river of the High Ice region that only formed during the warmest weeks of the year.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This flow of water was not a permanent feature of the High Ice, and as such, it was merely a river. When the sun rose above the peaks of the High Ice, part of the ice melted, and formed a steady stream. The Mere River was considered dangerous due its slippery icy flow and its surface that never completely froze.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The non-permanent Mere River was one of the more northern rivers of the High Ice, and it fed the Nyanza Lake to the west.</p>
