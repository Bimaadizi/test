<p>Lelavdra Tanthul was one of the Princes of Shade , and later, a member of " the Three ".</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Lelavdra was assertive, impulsive, cunning, ambitious, and unscrupulous. She could be ruthlessly manipulative, and was unafraid to use seduction to get what she wanted. She was also deeply attached to her elder sister, Manarlume Tanthul , and was uninterested in power or influence if they could not share in it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1487 DR , Lelavdra and her sister Manarlume were summoned by the High Prince Telamont Tanthul , who ordered them to gather in a kind of club all the young ambitious arcanists , and seduce the most suspicious in order to uncover all plots against Telamont. The Most High hinted that he knew about the ambitions of both Manarlume and Lelavdra and that new princesses could be easily sired.</p>
<p>After Larloch shattered the minds of most of the shadovar arcanists, the arcanist Gwelt went to Manarlume and Lelavdra, saying that he loved them both. They started discussing how to survive the fighting. Later, among the ruins of the collapsed Thultanthar , the three laughed about the stupidity of the High Prince.</p>
<p>The three subsequently declared themselves to be the rightful heirs to Telamont Tanthul. They relocated to a magically concealed fortress in the ruins of the Citadel of the Raven , creating the Court of the Three to rally survivors of Shade together. The sisters were largely responsible for keeping their activities hidden and for manipulating both their allies and enemies.</p>
