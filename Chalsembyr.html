<p>Chalsembyr , also known as the High Seat , was a realm located in the lands that later came to be known as the Border Kingdoms , in southern Faerûn . The kingdom existed over a millennia before the Era of Upheaval , during the years of the Netherese Empire . It was perhaps most well known for one of its rulers, the mortal Torm , who ascended to godhood and later joined Tyr and Ilmater to form the Triad .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Many followers of Torm sought out the ancient ruins of Chalsembyr in the centuries following its collapse. In fact, some orders of Tormish knights were solely dedicated to this task.</p>
<p>Some Tormish scholars believed that discovering the realm, and learning more about his life as a mortal man, would grant them a place at Loyal Fury's side as a celestial servant. Yet others believed that Torm would always refuse to reveal any information about his life on Faerûn , and believed the search for Chalsembyr to be a divine game and fruitless, yet essential, test of their faith.</p>
<p>One of the most famous paladins to undertake was Bertold the Seeker , who was granted the holy avenger , Chalsembyr's Heart from the House of the Hand in Procampur , to aid him on his quest.</p>
