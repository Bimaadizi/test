<p>Ollie's Discount Potions was a discount potions shop in the city of Ravens Bluff 's Flask Circle market in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Several glass cases could be found within the store, displaying its vast array of potions. And a small bell hung above the entryway, ringing upon anyone entering the shop.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Ollie's sold a wide variety of potions in all manners of color, shape, and size. The majority of these potions were unlabeled as a deterrent to thieves , though a select few had stiff pieces of paper in front of them that had their name written down. Besides selling potions, the store was also open to taking potions brought in, either purchasing them in return for gold pieces or as a trade in return for "potion credit" that could be used to buy potions at the shop. The owner would refuse to quote how much he was willing to spend on potions, only giving a price if a potion was presented for sale.</p>
<p>Potions were not sold at a static price, but rather frequently individually adjusted in value based upon the local supply and demand. The prices potions would be sold at or bought for would also rise as Ollie's stock dwindled. Additionally, Ollie's and the nearby Practical Potions would mutually check their prices against each other in order to curtail any potential arbitrage.</p>
<p>Customers were typically limited to buying three potions at a time in order to ensure a moderate stock was maintained. Some of the potions on offer on a given day included potions of animal control , clairaudience , clairvoyance , climbing , diminution , ESP , healing and extra-healing , fire resistance , levitation , polymorph self , rainbow hues , speed , water breathing , and elixirs of health .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in the late 14 th century DR, a group of thieves called the Hands of Mohammad robbed Ollie's Discount Potions of nearly all its inventory while the owner was away and the nearby Practical Potions of its entire stock. Three days later a group of adventurers came to the Flask Circle asking about both robberies, having been tasked by the City Watch to track down the thieves, but the operator of Ollie's had nothing to share and the owner of Practical Potions had since fled from Ravens Bluff.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
