<p>Seinin was one of the many isolated villages of the Fochu Peninsula in Wa . Its people made their living as fishers.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Seinin was a particularly dirty and depressing village. Most of the structures within the village were simple peasant shacks known as minka , built from wood with latticed walls and straw-thatched roofs. Apart from these poor residences were small barns, warehouses, and shops.</p>
<p>The people of Seinin were suspicious of strangers and not at all welcoming. The village had a population of about 475 individuals after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR) .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Seinin was located on the Sea of Patience on the west coast of the Fochu Peninsula of the island of Tsukishima . It was located near the Momoben Forest .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Villages in Wa were run by an administrator known as a shoya , typically a minor samurai , and Seinin was no different in this respect. The shoya could call upon a local militia if needed. The shoya of Seinin after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR) was Toi Jujishiki , who was a lazy man.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Like the other tiny settlements of the region, Seinin had little contact with the other villages, much less with the rest of Kara-Tur or regions beyond. The people were fishers, but there is no evidence that they traded in fish.</p>
<p>The village collected a "visitor's tax" of 1 yuan per person to enter. The cost to spend the night in one of the small minkas was 4 fen . The village did not produce anything more expensive than 3 tael to sell.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>About 48 citizens of Seinin served in its militia. These persons were only armed with simple clubs or spears .</p>
<p>The village also was home to a band of kabukimono , a group of retired warriors and ronin wearing colorful uniforms and calling themselves the Soldiers of Iron . The Soldiers of Iron had free reign to behave as they pleased in the village and often caused problems, especially when their members got drunk.</p>
<h2>Religion</h2>
<p>Like most of the villages of the Peninsula, the people of Seinin were strict followers of the Path of Enlightenment . They were usually strongly opposed to anyone visiting their village who would not demonstrate devotion to the Path by making a donation to a shrine, reciting a prayer, or spitting on the symbol of Chauntea , who was considered a heretical faith.</p>
<h2>Notable Inhabitants</h2>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed coiled dragon Za-Jikku began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical butterflies , the breath of which would create yun ch'i , the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever.</p>
<p>As part of his plan, Za-Jikku sent servants dressed in golden robes to pay members of the Soldiers of Iron to kill several of the villagers and hand over their bodies to Za-Jikku for transformation.</p>
