<p>The Stag That Got Away was an inn in Arrowmark in Tasseldale in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This quaint and quiet inn was known for the staggeringly high number of carvings of leaping stags scattered throughout the structure. The building was a labyrinth of dark halls with walls lined in old wooden panels that held intricate carvings. The rooms were fully furnished with old, musty furniture.</p>
<p>The inn was also known locally for its lack of service. Other than preparing the room and during checkout, the staff of the inn were often nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>A small rose garden was found in the back, complete with a pond filled with fish.</p>
