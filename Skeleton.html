<p>Skeletons were undead animated corpses similar to zombies , but completely devoid of flesh and did not feed on the living. They could be made from virtually any solid creature, and as such their size and power varied widely. In addition to the basic humanoid skeleton, there were also skeletons created from wolves , trolls , ettins and even giants .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The undead form of skeletons was held by necromantic energy, which kept otherwise loose bones and joints together and conferred on the undead corpse a glimmer of vitality and rudimentary intellectual capabilities.</p>
<p>Although skeletons were most typically created from humanoid remains, many other varieties existed.</p>
<h3>Variations</h3>
<h3>Other Varieties</h3>
<p>Athach skeleton • Blazing skeleton • Bloody bones • Boneshard skeleton • Bonewretch skeleton • Death kin skeleton • Defiling skeleton • Dread • Dry bones • Frost skeleton • Gem eyes • Insectoid • Lightning skeleton • Marrowshriek skeleton • Monster skeleton • Obsidian skelton • Runeflame skeleton • Shattergloom skeleton • Skeletal tomb guardian • Skinwalker skeleton • Skleros • Spine creep skeleton • Stonespawned skeleton • Tortured skeleton • Vicious skeleton</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Animated skeletons were immune to mind-affecting spells; they could not be rendered unconscious and could not tire. Edged and piercing weapons, such as swords and arrows, were mostly ineffective against skeletons; only blunt weapons, such as warhammers , were effective at knocking the bones apart.</p>
<p>Like other undead, skeletons could be repelled or destroyed outright by priests like paladins and clerics .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Creation</h3>
<p>The necromantic spell animate dead allowed spellcasters to create skeletons. They could also spontaneously rise in locations saturated with evil or necromantic powers.</p>
