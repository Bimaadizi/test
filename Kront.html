<p>Kront was a small crossroads settlement and trade outpost situated where the Great Road intersected with the Cold Road on the plains of Ashanath in the Unapproachable East . It was repudiated by the nearby nations of Thesk , Rashemen , and the tribes of Narfell , and was thus considered a part of the Great Dale .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Because of the terrible storms that came off Lake Ashane numerous times a year, all of the structures in Kront were built with cellars in which to to take shelter.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Kront was situated on the eastern end of the 300 mi (480 km) long Great Road , on the western shore of Lake Ashane.</p>
<p>It was located about 20 mi (32 km) south of the ruins of Shandaular .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Considering the crossroads town was a neutral locale at a site nestled between several different nations and powers, it made an ideal location for traders to stop along their journeys. Kront's residents traded their wares and provided services for these road-weary merchants. They traded goods such as hake , trout , and salmon from Lake Ashane along with smoked meats.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The independent settlement remained strong even after enduring numerous raids from the Nars horsemen of nearby Narfell .</p>
