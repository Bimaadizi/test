<p>Blending was a magical quality found on armor and clothes that allowed the wearer to hide more effectively.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Blending equipment allowed the wearer to appear to be part of existing rocks or plants, or as an innocuous creature. It could make the wearer appear to be up to twice as large or half as small. The illusion was not perfect, however, and sharp-eyed observers would notice soon enough that something was amiss if they passed within 30 feet.</p>
