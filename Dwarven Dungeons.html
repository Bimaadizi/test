<p>Dwarven Dungeons was an undercity complex of Myth Drannor that served as a home for the dwarven population of the city along with some others in the years predating the Weeping War .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The Dwarven Dungeons extended under the city of Myth Drannor and ran three levels deep. The Dwarven Dungeons served as the primary home for the dwarves of Myth Drannor and was a massive thoroughfare of halls, shops, and homes. The Dungeons had many complex locks and hidden doors that guarded more valuable treasure against the scavengers that ruled the ruins after the fall. The underground complex consisted of the Main Halls and the Deep Halls, which laid 85 steps deeper down.</p>
<p>The entrance to the Main Halls was located in Stillwater Ruins was sealed by the word of power " Alahnmalyr " (the word of Mystra ).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Weeping War of 711 DR to 714 DR , the Dwarven Dungeons were sealed using the glyphs and words of power by the survivors of the city's fall. Before that, wizards of Myth Drannor created one of many gates found in the ruins. The gate came to be known as the "Nightmare Gate" and was was opened in an attempt to repulse the invading Army of Darkness. The gates were never closed in time and overwhelmed the survivors, becoming one of the main sources of the undead infestation in the Dwarven Dungeons.</p>
<p>Juliban Genshihir , the Wizard of Air, who was responsible for Channels of the Earthborn Wind functionality, perished during that time, and his body inside a coffin was left in the Deep Halls along with the enchanted gem that was used to deactivate the magical ventilation mechanism.</p>
<p>Many years before the midâ€“14 th century DR , the young sorcerer Jarial and his lover Ozama were exploring the Dwarven Dungeons in search of elven magic. They had a fight and the young woman placed a curse on Jarial, trapping him in a rock, but alive and unable to move from his spot. The curse kept him alive and invulnerable to damage, magic, and death until he was freed by the heroes from Phlan in 1369 DR, with the sorcerer promising his aid in their quest.</p>
<p>By the late 1360s DR , the Dwarven Dungeons were a place of conflict with orcs , lizardfolk , the ancient undead, and the Cult of the Dragon feuding over territory.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the heroes from Phlan made their way through the Dwarven Dungeons in an attempt to get inside the ruined Castle Cormanthor . Subsequently, they defeated the orcish chiefs Zud and Mol the Great who were the leaders of two of the tribes that resided within the ruins and were in conflict with each other. The heroes also aided the lost ormyrr Gebb and helped his clan, the Sharpsticks , to take back the area they'd come to call home. The same group assisted the ghosts of Elena and her lover Garras to restore the Lifespring Wells to their working order, destroying the golem that guarded them and helping the restless spirits reach their afterlife.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Before 1369 DR , the Dwarven Dungeons were home for stronger creatures like alhoons and phaerimm until the Cult of the Dragon 's occupation that year. The cult drove the stronger creatures out with the help of the dracolich Pelendralaar . The Cult itself kept their presence in the Dungeons mostly to the Halls of Light with regular expeditions into the depths, plundering for ancient artifacts.</p>
<p>During the Cult's reign, the Dungeons were home to undead, a few orc tribes, a clan of ormyrr , a lizardfolk tribe, and restless spirits of the people who'd perished in the Fall of Myth Drannor. A tribe of peaceful orogs claimed territory in the Halls of Light and stood their ground against the Cult's forces.</p>
<p>The orc chief Zud camped in the Main Halls' large open square, protected by his fellow orc shaman and an orc witch doctor. The chief of the tribe that opposed them was Mol the Great , who could be found on the same level.</p>
<p>The ancient ghasts Onglore and Inglore resided in their tomb further into the Dwarven Dungeons' Main Halls.</p>
<p>Elf ghosts of Elena and her lover Garras could be found haunting the Lifespring Wells of the Main Halls. The ghost of the last dwarven brewmaster was still around his Shrine of Hanseath.</p>
<p>A dark naga collector of magical necklaces named Preybelish resided in one of the rooms of the Main Halls. His lair was behind a door sealed with a word of power called the word of venom .</p>
<p>The Halls of Stone level of the dwarven dungeons was the territory contested by the lizardfolk led by Malgi Hi , an orog tribe, and the hordes of the undead creatures pouring out of the Nightmare Gate .</p>
<p>The angry specter that used to be the lockmaster of the Bedlam Prison could be found haunting the Deep Halls.</p>
<p>Vicious and terrifying arraccats nested in the Deep Halls and the Halls of Light.</p>
