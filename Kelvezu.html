<p>Kelvezu were a type of tanar'ri demon , their services sought after as very useful spies and assassins in the Infinite Layers of the Abyss .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kelvezu stood out among the higher-ranking demons for their height, standing barely 5 feet (1.5 meters) tall, and they had rose-red skin. Due to their height and humanoid form, they could be mistaken for humans if their disguises could hide the hue of their skin.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Kelvezu constantly coated their weapons with a poison secreted from their own fingertips that acted via injury. Kelvezu poison was quickly neutralized, however, losing its effectiveness within a minute.</p>
<p>In addition to their standard senses and darkvision , kelvezu could see enemies as if they were under the constant effects of detect magic and could even see through invisibility effects . They were known for their great reflexes and ability to evade area effects and could not be flanked or taken by surprise.</p>
<p>Kelvezu had a range of magical powers that they could use at will: they could teleport flawlessly (themselves and up to 50 pounds (23 kilograms) of cargo), read magic , conjure deep darkness , and understand languages , could make an area unholy or desecrated , make a suggestion , dispel great magic , detect good and law , and greater invisibility . Once per day, a kelvezu could attempt to call upon the aid of another kelvezu, although aid would come only once for every four attempts.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Each kelvezu usually carried a +1 scimitar of greater wounding shaped like a snake 's tail and a +1 dagger of wounding shaped like a snake's tooth.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Kelvezu always tried to strike from stealth, relying not only on their invisibility but also on a talent for hiding and sneaking. Like their mortal counterparts, assassins , they attempted to dispatch their chosen targets quickly, aided by their poisons. If they failed, they would retreat and strike again under more favorable conditions.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Their services were usually sought after and used by powerful demons of the Abyss , among them the mariliths and balors . Kelvezu rarely led troops into battle; instead they would surgically eliminate specific opponents like devils , rival demons, or difficult mortals.</p>
<p>They patrolled Twelvetrees , 12 th layer of the Abyss , and murdered any trespassers wandering there. Some of a less murderous mind might be were encountered in Shendilavri , 570 th layer of the Abyss, where one sold addictive, euphoric substances.</p>
<p>Their services were particularly popular with the demon lord Lascer . He would send them on missions that were not worth his personal participation and they acted as his personal bodyguards if he was ever attacked.</p>
