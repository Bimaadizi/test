<p>Pingtu was a deep gnome priest in Blingdenstone .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Pingtu was briefly an acolyte priest under high priest Bendekik before 1371 DR . Pingtu escaped the drow attack of that year.</p>
<p>In 1479 DR , Pingtu was back in the city and was the new head priest. However, when he tried a divination ritual, Pingtu heard the voice of his dead master. With help of an adventuring party hired by Kargien Dissengulp , he followed his master's instructions in order to end a curse Bendekik had triggered in 1371 DR.</p>
