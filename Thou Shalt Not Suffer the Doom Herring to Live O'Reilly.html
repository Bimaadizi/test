<p>Thou Shalt Not Suffer the Doom Herring to Live O'Reilly was a mad paladin of Helm , who embarked on a quest to end the true power behind the notorious Xanathar's Thieves' Guild sometime before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , paladin O'Reilly became convinced that the Xanathar's Thieves' Guild of Skullport was not led by a beholder , but by something called a doom herring . This led to him changing his name to the overlong "Thou Shalt Not Suffer the Doom Herring to Live O'Reilly." Fuelled by this belief and Helmite doctrine, O'Reilly penned the book Lessons of Helm , filled with religious ramblings focused on the Helmite belief of providing protection for the meek and downtrodden.</p>
