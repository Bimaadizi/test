<p>A cauldron of gateways was a rare enchanted cauldron that had the power to create gates to any destination on the same plane of existence , but also acted adequately as a regular cooking pot.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>In order to activate this cauldron , a user had to bring fresh water to a steaming boil, then put in some soil from the desired destination, and finally utter the command words "I demand a path". Once all steps were carried out, a translucent image of the location where the soil originated would manifest in the steam arising from the cauldron . The steam acted as a gate , with stepping through it transporting individuals to the depicted location. The steam would stay active for around twenty minutes to as long as two bells . If stepping through the steam as it was deactivating, there was a chance an individual's body could be bisected.</p>
<p>A cauldron of gateways could be used once per week and was unable to be transported through its own gate .</p>
