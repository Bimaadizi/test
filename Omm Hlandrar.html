<p>Omm Hlandrar was an archmage of Halruaa in south Faerûn . His lifetime spanned at least from the 8 th to the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Omm Hlandrar was known to have fought a spell -battle with Velsharoon the Vaunted , then a mortal Red Wizard of Thay , over the skies of the Shaar in the Year of the Sacrificed Fortune, 827 DR . It ended in a draw.</p>
<p>Continuing into the mid–14 th century DR, Omm was one of those wizards—listed among Halder of Delzimmer , Szass Tam of Thay , Elminster of Shadowdale , and the Simbul of Aglarond —who challenged Velsharoon in his wicked plots. In turn, the arch-necromancer worked to acquire enough power to destroy Omm and all the other mages who'd opposed him. In the late 1350s DR, Velsharoon was working on a means of achieving godhood, and Omm and the others feared for their safety and for the safety and stability of the Realms. Velsharoon ultimately achieving godhood in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR .</p>
