<p>Zarifar was a drow wizard from Sshamath in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Zarifar was a very talented geometer with his mind always full of geometric designs. However, in normal life he was totally naive.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Haunting, 1377 DR , Q'arlynd Melarn invited him to his new College of Ancient Arcana and he accepted.</p>
<p>Zarifar, like all his fellows, became one of the masters of the new school by 1379 DR , despite the worries of Q'arlynd about his skills as a teacher. Together with his fellows and the Masters Urlryn Khalazza , Seldszar Elpragh , and Masoj Dhuunyl he helped Q'Arlynd when he engineered (with the aid of Eilistraee ) the ritual that transformed all drow not tainted by Wendonai 's blood into their original dark elves . After that, they all relocated to Rhymanthiin .</p>
<p>By 1480 DR , Zarifar was working at the library in the dwarven city of Sundasz . There, he met Torrin Ironstar and helped him to understand earth magic.</p>
