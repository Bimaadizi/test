<p>Owain's Lullabye was a unique enchanted musical instrument imbued with deadly cold magics, created by a disturbed Aurilian bard , Owain Piper , long before the late 13 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When used by a bard, Owain's Lullabye could unleash a deadly blast of freezing cold, similar to a higher-powered cone of cold spell . The instrument could hold seven charges of the spell.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Owain's Lullabye was the creation of Owain Piper of Silverymoon and his mage friend named Pelham of the Moor , with whom Owain adventured across the Moonsea . Owain and Pelham remained in contact for decades after the travels were done, and one day, Owain commissioned the instrument from his friend. Owain's Lullabye was rarely used in battle; instead, the bard used its freezing magics on late-migrating geese . The horn produced a call that sounded like the geese's kin flying south, and as they took flight, he would freeze them mid-flight and leave them to die.</p>
<p>Sometime later, Owain's Lullabye was interred within the tomb of Briath Silverhand , a dwarven smith, within Dorn's Deep 's Hall of Heroes. Centuries later, in the 1281 DR , the instrument was still inside the tomb. By the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , it was a part of the magic item collection owned by Agaza , the night hag who tortured the town of Lonelywood with sleepless nights and waking nightmares.</p>
