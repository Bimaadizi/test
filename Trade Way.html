<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the Spellplague , traffic to Luskan and Calimport was nearly non-existent but the Trade Way remained in use from Waterdeep to the southern edges of Tethyr. The Trade Way was no longer considered safe and paladins from Elturgard guarded the crossing at the Winding Water River. Caravan guards were considered a necessity and were in constant demand.</p>
