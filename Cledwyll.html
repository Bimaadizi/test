<p>Cledwyll was a renowned Cormyte sculptor who lived sometime during the 10 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Cledwyll's original art was worth a fortune and had a very distinct style.</p>
<p>One of his pieces, a curvaceous sculpture of the goddess Selûne caved out of black stone, was personally gifted by Cledwyll to the founder of the noble House Wyvernspur of Cormyr, Paton Wyvernspur , sometime before the Lord's death in the Year of the Slaying Spells, 976 DR . Cledwyll's Selûne was almost 2 feet (0.61 meters) tall and 0 feet and 8 inches (0.2 meters) around. The sculpture was graceful and scantily clad; the woman's position was arched with arms raised up over her head in a circle, her lips slightly parted, with her eyes closed as if waiting for a surprise. The statue eventually came to be stored in Drone Wyvernspur 's laboratory in the Redstone Castle in the mid–14 th century DR , wrapped in red velvet and twine. Drone described Cledwyll's Selûne as ample, while the family's stern matriarch Dorath Wyvernspur called the statue scandalous. After his supposed death, Drone sent Cledwyll's Selûne, the patron goddess of the family, to his nephew Giogioni Wyvernspur as a hint at the family's history. Later, a Harper " bard " named Olive Ruskettle instantly recognized the black marble salacious statue as one of Cledwyll's originals.</p>
<p>Shortly before the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR , another one of Cledwyll's originals was purchased by Jannaxil Serpentil of Waterdeep . The purchase was detailed in his account book, which was stolen by Harpers Danilo Thann and Arilyn Moonblade .</p>
