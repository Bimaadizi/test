<p>Mistshore was the name given to the dilapidated north shore of Waterdeep 's harbor in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the Spellplague of 1385 DR , Waterdeep went into a decline and maintenance of the harbor was neglected. Many ships sank or were scuttled in the northern harbor and eventually Waterdeep's outcasts created a small community on the wrecked ship hulls. The harbor water was polluted and smelled horribly.</p>
<p>In Mirtul of 1491 DR , Mistshore was largely destroyed in a massive fire, with most ships burning down to the waterline and having to be towed out of the harbor to prevent other vessels from running afoul the wreckage. By 1492 DR , most buildings in the neighborhood were still burned and abandoned.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mistshore was considered so dangerous that the City Watch refused to send patrols into the area.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The treasure hunter Grinda Garloth lived in a small residence in Mistshore. She often used her apparatus of Kwalish to search for treasure in Deepwater Harbor .</p>
