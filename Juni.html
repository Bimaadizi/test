<h2>History</h2>
<p>Juni's husband disappeared and Juni thought that the lizardlings have captured him. Mayne did not want to make a search for him, so the Kalach-Cha could find him. William, Juni's husband, was hiding away from his wife near Highcliff Castle , as he does not want any more responsibilites. The Kalach-Cha could persuade him to come back or let him go.
