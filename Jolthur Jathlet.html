<p>Jolthur Jathlet was the patriarch of the Jathlet merchant family in Delzimmer until his demise circa the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR . He had a long reign as head of the family and was still in his prime when a suspicious riding accident took his life. He was succeeded by his widow, Elsraea , but she did not have much influence over Jolthur's many brother and uncles, some of whom were powerful mages, and she became mainly a figurehead in a male-dominated clan. Jolthur was the father of Dolrur , one of many sons and nephews that were also trying to make a name for themselves in Delzimmer and elsewhere.</p>
