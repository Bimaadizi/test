<h2>History</h2>
<p>Amraith joined his adventuring group sometime before the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , when he, along with the Hands of Fury, traveled aboard a pirate ship to the city of Luskan , ending up stranded there after the further marine plans fell apart. Seeing no other opportunities for profit, the troupe answered a call for mercenaries coming from the far northern town of Targos , besieged by the Legion of the Chimera .</p>
