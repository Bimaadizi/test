<p>The Shadowdark was an underground domain of the Underdark situated in the Deep Wastes just beneath Shadowdale .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Covering a 120-mile area of the Upperdark , the Shadowdark was largely centered around the village of Shadowdale . Riddled with tunnels, springs, lakes and even geothermal locations, the Shadowdark made a number of connections with surface locations around the dale and gave ample places for the drow in the area to hide.</p>
