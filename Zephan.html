<p>Zephan was a male Tethyrian human evoker in Cormyr in the midâ€“14th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Zephan, Dava , and Mendios were apprentices to an evoker from Marsember .</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , their master sent the three apprentices to the Temple of Mystra in Wheloon to make an offering to the goddess of magic . They also partook in the three-day-long ritual of Mystra's Sacred Trust that the priests there were pushing, alongside nine others: Durgen Glintstone , Halish , Kareem Hastith , Smote , Tholwick Styles , Veera Wavecrest , Duncan , Kenniwick , and Amnic Basult .</p>
<p>In the end, Starweaver Deinyn Fembrys dominated all of them with the Starry Gnosis , abducting them as part of a secret Sharran plot. They were then put on Mhair 's boat across the Wyvernflow , before journeying overland to the Vast Swamp and the Lost Refuge within. Still dominated , Zephan, Dava, and Mendios, as well as Halish, a genuine cleric of Mystra, were left to wait in the so-called Rooms of Waiting before they were sent through the Dusk Lord's Passage to the Plane of Shadow . When adventurers tracked them down and came to disrupt the Sharran plot, the four of them would try to defend the Sharrans and fight the heroes in the name of Mystra, until at last their minds were freed from the deceitful grip of the Starry Gnosis .</p>
