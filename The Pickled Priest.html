<p>Orlimmin was a village in the Vast , lying where the Long Reach from Bambryn met the Tantras Trail between Tantras and Highbank Forest .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Orlimmin was a quiet agricultural center. It was at its busiest when the cattle auctions were held and buyers and drovers, and their cattle, descended on the village en masse .</p>
<p>South of Orlimmin rose a rugged plateau like a great wall. The area was scattered with gravel pits, worked by miners from Orlimmin. They mostly dug up what they needed and sold any excess to the nearby cities of Tantras and Ravens Bluff .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1364 DR , The Cabal of the Crown adventuring company from Procampur visited Orlimmin to explore the gravel pits. One night, one of the pits erupted with fireball s, lightning bolt s and similar destructive spells . Although the villagers watched from outside The Pickled Priest, they waited until morning to investigate. Most of the Cabal were found dead, many beheaded, in or beside the pit. A few survivors had fled all the way to Tantras, and refused to speak of what they saw, let alone return to Orlimmin.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The gravel pits were rumored to conceal a number of treasures, plus the buried bodies of thieves from Tantras and Ravens Bluff who'd double-crossed and been murdered by their fellows.</p>
<p>The grandest legend claimed that one of the pits was the burial site of an early high priest of Waukeen , goddess of trade. This priest was said to be buried upright according to old Waukeenar custom, and standing upon a stack of gold bars, wearing cloth-of-gold vestments and a ring on every finger bearing a different gem . The total value of the grave goods was estimated to be over 60,000 gold pieces . There was no grave-marker to indicate which pit, likely because the early Waukeenar graveposts were adorned with gold and gems and were a target of thieves. Following Waukeen's disappearance after 1358 DR , people thought heavily about finding and excavating the buried priest, but most of these plans were shelved when the goddess returned in 1370 DR , with only a few still poking around at nights afterward.</p>
<p>Village gossips, inventive bards, and gullible adventurers spread the tale that the Cabal of the Crown had awoken an elder vampire who'd slain them. However, the flashy spells, lack of undead, and victims still with all their blood in them or on the ground, all told against the vampire theory.</p>
<p>Given the dangers, adventurers interested in exploring the gravels pits for whatever reason were asked to pay for their rooms at in advance, just in case.</p>
