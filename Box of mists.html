<p>A box of mists was a rare and powerful magical artifact that could be used to move an entire marine vessel to another location, avoiding pursuit.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When opened, a box of mists summoned strange, swirling, green-glowing mists. The mists enveloped the ship and its passengers where the box was opened. It was impossible to see through the globe of swirling mists. A short time later, the mists receded revealing a different location the ship was transported to.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1377 DR , a shady benefactor of a group of pirates hired to assassinate Eidola of Neverwinter paid dearly for a box of mists to use on his mission. He did not expect to use the artifact soon after leaving the harbor of Tharkar but an ambush by a ship called Black Dragon forced his hand. Even though they escaped the pursuit by traveling through the mists, the Black Dragon found them again thanks to a magical tracker planted on board.</p>
