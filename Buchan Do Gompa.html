<p>Buchan Do Gompa was a monastery (a gompa in the Tabotan language ) of the Way of Enlightenment in Tabot .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It stood on the southwestern border of Tabot, near the border with Phutan .</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>The monks of Buchan Do were often in conflict with the people of Phutan.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was founded some time between Shou Year 585 (−665 DR) and Shou Year 640 (−610 DR) , when fifteen groups of monks and temple guardians escaped persecution in Shou Lung and journeyed southwest in search of a holy land that would remain pure and lasting, ideal for isolated hermitages. One of these groups built the beginnings of Buchan Do.</p>
<p>In Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) , Buchan Do lamas reported a Phutanese army assembling at the border. This put Tabot on a war footing, with its own soldiers mustering in the area.</p>
