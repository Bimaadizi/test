<p>Skalnaedyr was an elder blue dragon and the ruler of the city in Murghôm that bore his name. He was one of the Princes of Murghôm , and also considered to be the strongest wyrm who lived in Murghôm as of 1479 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1409 DR , a plague swept through the dragon population of the Copper Mountains , causing many dragons to flee. Skalnaedyr flew to Murghôm and stopped to rest near a small village known as Phannaskull . The frightened villagers pledged fealty to the surprised dragon, who agreed to rule the village. Due to Skalnaedyr's enlightened (for a dragon) rule, the village grew into a city during the 15th century DR.</p>
<p>He also rescued the dragonborn Ananta from an unknown but certainly grisly fate, and made her Guardian of Dracowyr . Skalnaedyr really cared for her to the point of putting himself in harm way in order to protect her if she was in danger.</p>
<p>In 1479 DR, he acceded to play the xorvintaal proposed by the vampiric smoke drake Brimstone .</p>
