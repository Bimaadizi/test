<p>Aolis Ildacer was the commander of the N'Vaelahr during the Fall of Myth Drannor .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Aolis born in −90 DR .</p>
<p>In 711 DR , Aolis and his wife Amara Ildacer , both able Akh'Faer officers, after a meeting with the Grand Mage Ualair , Arms-Major Kelvhan Olortynnal , and Councilor Phraan Audark , decided to create the N'Vaelahr , a covert army.</p>
<p>In 712 DR , Aolis devised and supported the Spider's Truce , a secret alliance with the drow of House Dhuurniv in exchange for the drow's possession of the Twisted Tower of Ashaba . Despite being viewed as traitors, the allied Dhuurniv–N'Vaelahr troops fought very well against the Army of Darkness .</p>
<p>However, in Midwinter – Alturiak 1 of 713 DR , Aolis fell alongside Matron Mother Laele Dhuurniv , and the Spider Truce was ended. In that battle, Laele killed Aolis from behind but afterward was quickly killed by Amara Ildacer.</p>
