<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the summer of the Year of the Purloined Statue, 1477 DR , on Kythorn 19 , the Sailor's Crossing plaza became a scene of a grizzly murder. An adventuring detective named Tav conducted the investigation when a cloaked figure of a thief darted past, carrying a coin purse stolen from the murder victim. On Kythorn 22 , Tav ventured to Canary Lane in an attempt to track down the thief, who was considered a prime suspect. The investigator chased down a young urchin nicknamed Magpie who ended up slipping past drain grates into the sewers, marked with the symbol of The Guild .</p>
