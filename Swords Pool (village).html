<p>Swords Pool was a village in the Vast , lying on the North Road between Dead Tree Hollow and King's Reach .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The village lay in a wooded dell on the North Road. It served as a stopover for travelers, and was notable for its high-quality inn, the Inn of the Nine Swords , which stood on the western side of the road. Around 1370 DR , it was owned by the three Mellicot sisters: Melicent , Meliors , and Melusine .</p>
<p>Behind the inn lay Swords Pool itself, a deep and dark body of water. The Mellicots stocked the pool with trout and a type of fish they called " manyfins ". They discouraged fishing, but some people did it anyway on dark nights.</p>
<h2>Local legends</h2>
<p>The pool was the source of a local treasure tale that gave it, the village, and the inn their names. In the early history of the Vast, when the Nine Swords Company disbanded, the famous sage , wizard , and swordsage Thallastam of Procampur concealed his companions' nine swords in the pool using a spell he'd cast, to protect and preserve them.</p>
<p>In the mid-1370s DR , several young blade magicians of the Vast re-founded the Nine Swords Company, and used the Inn of the Nine Swords.</p>
