<p>Lurgan was a duergar member of the Cult of the Absolute during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lurgan had gray skin and a closely-trimmed beard. He wore a chainmail and a helmet with the holy symbol of the absolute dangling around his neck.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Lurgan accompanied slaver Gekh Coal and his duergar to a decrepit coastal village in the Underdark that once was a deep gnome colony. On the behest of the Absolute, duergar held the ruined village to be used as a skiff port to transport goods and slaves to the Grymforge . With the events of the Absolute crisis unfolding, Lurgan and his fellow duergar could have faced several fates; they could've been confronted by and slain by the Absolute Adversaries as they sought passage to the Grymforge or as a favor to an aspiring myconid sovereign Glut .</p>
