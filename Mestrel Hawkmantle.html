He foiled the spy's slaving operation and followed him to Westgate , where Mestrel identified the spy's master and, with the help of a fellow Harper wizard from Suzail , read the mind of the superior before killing him.</p>
<p>Thanks to the information gained, Mestrel ruined another slaving operation with the help of the adventuring party called the Shining Shield Band , some novice fellow Harpers, and the deceived Pirates of the Fallen Stars , taking the free slaves to Yhaunn .</p>

<p>In the Vast , Mestrel slew the evil wizard Rundleth Talhart . Though Rundleth was independent, Mestrel framed him as one of the Zhentarim. He later saved fifty slaves in the Earthfast Mountains from drow slavers.</p>
<p>In Lyrabar , he exposed a cheating merchant before sailing to Aglarond . Later, Mestrel ruined a slaving business in Telflamm and after a trip to Rashemen he destroyed a bandit group near Murghôm .
