<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>Due to the magic worked in the tomb proper, the tomb proper radiated evil and ever light gained a red or amber hue.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Hund Hiilgauntlet spent his days reading, contemplating, and fighting and destroying his own maidservants for fun. Hund was willing to buy books from people who managed to get to him. One of the projects of Hund was to increase the number of the undead under his control by dead people into his room and hoping that the magic of his room eventually turned them into a skeleton or zombie . By 1371 DR, he had yet to see success.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The person who was referred to in the complex's name, Lord Hund's Tomb, was Hund Hiilgauntlet , a member of House Hiilgauntlet , a noble family from Waterdeep that made its money by supplying mercenary services as well as military equipment.</p>
<p>Hund was a weirdo by the standards of his family. He was interested in necromancy and in building his own tomb. He was not allowed to build one in the City of the Dead . Therefore, he built one in Undermountain after finding a two-way portal to an area in the Arcane Chambers , the second level of Undermountain. This one was the Lord Hund's Tomb.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In 1371 DR, apart from Hund Hiilgauntlet, there were a large number of aforementioned non-intelligent undead, a darkenbeast, and a gas spore. Its intelligent inhabitants were a wraith, and a cloaker who pretended to be a tapestry in the entry chamber.</p>
