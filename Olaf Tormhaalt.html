<p>Olaf Tormhaalt was a Reghedmen human warrior from the Tribe of the Elk in the midâ€“15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Olaf was the only son of the shaman of the Tribe of the Elk, Mjenir Tormhaalt . His mother passed away when he was a child.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Olaf didn't inherit his father's ability to communicate with spirits or his inquisitiveness about the world. Instead, he chose to undergo training as one of the tribe's warriors. His mother's death and his father being more inclined to converse with animals than with his own son made Olaf feel lonely. He was quieter and more introverted in contrast with the other warriors.</p>
<p>When a young girl named Hedrun Arnsfirth began to exhibit strange abilities and faced rejection from the rest of the tribe, Olaf felt a deep connection with her. Olaf's attraction to her extended beyond her physical allure, as they both grappled with the same sense of isolation. The two grew closer, but Olaf's father disapproved of their relationships and forbade them seeing each over. The shaman was suspicious about Hedrun's powers exceeding his own, which could result in him losing his position in the tribe.</p>
<p>Olaf and Hedrun continued to secretly see each other outside the camp. During one of these rendezvous, they shared their first kiss. But at that very moment, Hedrun's powers as Chosen of Auril manifested and Olaf froze to death. Auril's envy ensured that Hedrun could not have mortal love.</p>
<p>Later Mjenir brought Olaf's dead body before King Jarund to ensure Hedrun was banished from the tribe.</p>
