<p>Mullivan was a former adventurer and mind-thrall in Oryndoll in 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mullivan was a ranger and leader of an adventuring party from Almraiven . His mission soon became cleansing Calimshan and Tethyr from mind flayer influence.</p>
<p>Finally, in the Forest of Mir , they discovered caves to the Underdark . Incautiously, Mullivan lead his comrades down and they arrived at the gates of Oryndoll. Mullivan sacrificed his own life to permit to a handful of his friends to escape. Afterward, the survivors of that expedition renamed themselves the Scimitars of Mullivan and started a war against Oryndoll, directing many adventuring parties against illithids and continuing their cleansing of the surface from mind flayer influence.</p>
<p>Unknown to his friends, however, Mullivan was aliveâ€”he was resurrected by illithids using a new psionic science similar to a raise dead spell. Thereafter, the illithids used Mullivan as a mind-thrall, but unknown to his illithid masters, the resurrection gave Mullivan some kind of psionic immunity and he kept a degree of free will. Mullivan then waited for the right time to escape.</p>
