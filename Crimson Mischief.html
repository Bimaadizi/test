<p>The Crimson Mischief was a unique enchanted shortsword wielded by Orin the Red in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The sword possessed a +2 enchantment that strengthened its physical attacks and guided the wielder's arm toward targets. Additionally, the sword was imbued with magic that dealt necrotic damage to the targets with each stab. The same magic made the sword even more deadly when wielded against targets who were weakened or had sustained significant damage. When the sword was wielded in the owner's dominant hand, it dealt additional piercing damage.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Orin the Red, the murderous daughter of Sarevok Anchev , wielded the Crimson Mischief since she was a mere child, entertaining her sadistic tendencies. She still used the sword as one of her favorite blades in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR and it only left her cruel hands after her death.</p>
