<p>A minor death was a type of deadly skeletal creature.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Minor deaths appeared as robed skeletons wielding scythes .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Minor deaths were immune to cold, electricity, and fire -based spells and abilities. They were also immune to the effects of charm, enchantment , and sleep -based spells.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Minor deaths fought with their scythes, attacking until either they or their target were defeated. A minor death could not be disarmed.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Minor deaths could be summoned once per tenday by Myrkulyte specialty priests known as Gray Ones , high-level clerics of Kelemvor , and Kelemvorite specialty priests known as Doomguides . In the case of Kelemvor, the minor deaths sent by him were transformed einheriar . If the conjured minor death were to be destroyed, the Gray One or Kelemvorite cleric who summoned it would be unable to summon another minor death until they had killed a living creature. Doomguides on the other hand, had to burn a special incense costing around 1,000 gp on a consecrated altar within a Kelemvorite temple.</p>
<p>Pulling the "Skull" card from a deck of many things could summon a minor death with the singular focus of killing the one who drew the card. If anyone tried to aid in the individual's fight, another minor death would be conjured to fight them. Unlike the minor deaths that were summoned through divine magic , any creature killed by the minor death of a deck of many things could not be raised from the dead by any means.</p>
