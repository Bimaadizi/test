<p>It was an established practice for Men of the Realms to wear an artificial rose on their shoulder to signal their interest in courtship or sexual encounters. The color of the rose would provide further information.</p>
<p>In some cases, dandies or exuberant men would wear four roses (or more) to indicate that they were looking for more than one partners to spend the night with. This practice was usually met with mockeries or ridicule outside of very specific times or places (such as some festhalls ). Mirt "the Moneylender" was known to sometimes wear artificial roses in this fashion.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Furthinghome , around 1374 DR , was notable for its culture and export of roses, amongst other flowers.</p>
