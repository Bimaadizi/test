<p>The Underdark Arena was a gladiatorial arena in the Underdark of Cormyr during the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Deescription</h2>
<p>The arena was a large square chamber with gates on each side, nooks in each corner, and a slightly elevated stage in the center. The audience and the arena master viewed the fights from their seats above the arena.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the drow attacked the King's Forest and Eveningstar , House Cay'Vorym aimed to profit by using captured surfacers in their arena fights. Overseen by Azena'ar the drider , they ran fights to the death with willing drow and yuan-ti contestants, and large numbers of enslaved human villagers, Purple Dragons , and War Wizards controlled with drow slave collars . With the duergar Djir Garpeth advertising the events in the Eveningstar Cavern , they hoped to draw in opportunistic willing fighters from the surface as well. Azena'ar's champions included Oolgnim the oneirophage, Hessperina the medusa , and several powerful drow warriors, mages, and priestesses . There was also a mysterious wizard who donated treasure chests to the arenaâ€”though each one was accompanied by three mimics . If all the champions were defeated, Azena'ar may have been incensed enough to jump into the arena himself and fight to the death</p>
<p>Some time after this, the red dragon Aptoryx took over the arena, filling it with molten magma and replacing most of the gladiators with summoned planar beings that could survive the heat. His stable of champions included Scintilla the Fire Witch, the hulking and upset Brimstone Archon , and the salamander Finnfaran . The unseen wizard also returned to provide a mix of chests and mimics. If all his fighters were destroyed, Aptoryx would be intrigued enough to risk his life fighting in the arena as well.</p>
