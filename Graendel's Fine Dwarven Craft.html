<p>Graendel's Fine Dwarven Craft was a smithy in the town of Targos in Icewind Dale in the 14 th and 15 th centuries DR . It was run by Graendel Granitefist</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It lay in the western part of town.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Graendel had come to Icewind Dale with Clan Battlehammer and the other refugees of the fall of Mithral Hall in the latter half of the 12 th century DR . By the late 15 th century, he had been working as a smith in Targos since before the other townsfolk's grandparents were born.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Graendel forged a variety of metalwork, from pieces of armor to blades for weapons to anchors for the town's fishing boats. He crafted every piece to order and his attention to detail and quality meant they were perfectly fitted to the user's specifications. However, his work was slow as a result, so most people went to one of the regular smiths in Targos for basic tools or quick armor patches. Nevertheless, circa 1485 DR , guards came here all the way from Bryn Shander to get their armor repaired or adjusted.</p>
