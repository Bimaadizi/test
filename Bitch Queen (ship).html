<p>The Bitch Queen was a ship and floating temple to the goddess Umberlee that sailed the seas along the western coasts of Faer√ªn during the Era of Upheaval .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The ships figurehead featured the likeness of a screaming woman with kelp for hair, presumably Umberlee herself.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nearly a century before the Second Sundering , the Bitch Queen crashed against the shores of the Snout of Omgar in Chult . The tortles of the isle rescued the survivors of the shipwreck, including its captain, a charismatic woman and cleric of Umberlee. All that remained of the Bitch Queen itself was its figurehead, its bowsprit, and a portion of its aft castle.</p>
<p>Taken in by the captain's charm, and captivating stories about sea monsters and naval battles, the tortles built for her and her people the temple-fortress of Dangwaru .</p>
