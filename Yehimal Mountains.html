<p>The Yehimal , a name meaning "Rock-Snow" , or the Mountains of Snow , and sometimes called the Yehimal Mountains or simply the Yehimals , was an immense mountain range that formed the primary barrier between the three continents of Zakhara , Faerûn , and Kara-Tur , and between them the Hordelands . They were famed as the largest, highest, most extensive, and indeed greatest mountain range in all the known lands of Toril .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Yehimal was undoubtedly the most majestic natural wonder in all the Hordelands, thanks to its soaring, glacier-topped peaks. These ranged in height from 15,000 ft (4,600 m) to astonishing 30,000 ft (9,100 m) above sea level, marking them as the tallest in the world. The mountains were formed from folded and upthrust granite , with jagged profiles.</p>
<p>The mountains sprawled southwest of Shou Lung in Kara-Tur and lay south and east of the Jumpa River Gorge , which delineated the mountains from the steppes of the Hordelands. The Yehimal effectively dominated and separated the steppes from the southern kingdoms.</p>
<p>The Yehimal appeared to have been formed as a result of the southeastern part of the continental plate being pushed over its own southwestern part. As the colossal mountains of the Yehimal were forced upward, the Jumpa River Gorge was driven downward, creating twice over an insurmountable physical barrier across half the continent.</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>The Yehimal was an enormously extensive system of mountains that sprawled across three continents. It comprised multiple lesser mountain ranges and branches, each of which had lesser mountain ranges and branches of their own. Some of the most significant were:</p>
<h3>Climate</h3>
<p>As a very high mountainous area, the climate around the peaks was extremely cold. Unexpectedly, snow was relatively light, as the wind was too great and the thin air could hold little moisture or warmth. Misty clouds wreathed the upper slopes, while formidable winds rushed around the mountains. Windstorms could howl for days on end, and were a serious hazard for travelers. However, the countless valleys and low points were more hospitable.</p>
<h2>Flora & Fauna</h2>
<p>Although the mountain valleys could be quite fertile, the high altitudes could barely support life, owing to the bare rock, extreme cold, unending wind, and thin air. The majority of vegetation at these heights were only beds of hardy lichens and mosses, and no natural plants grew at all above around 17,000 feet (5180 meters).</p>
<p>The Yehimal were home to the typical beasts of the high mountains found around the Hordelands. In particular, snow leopards could be found there.</p>
<h2>Locations</h2>
<p>The Yehimal and their attendant ranges held many glaciers, whose run-off formed many of the great rivers that flowed out of the mountains.</p>
<p>Deep in the heart of the Yehimal, hidden in one of the valleys, was the fabled and sacred Cave of the Monkey .</p>
<p>The Jumpa River began in the Katakoro Shan and was fed by the whole northwestern face of the mountains, making it one of the most high-volume rivers of the mountains. It flowed through the Jumpa River Gorge, paralleling the foot of the mountains, and through the Great Pass of the Yehimal .</p>
<p>The mystical realm of Langdarma lay isolated and hidden deep in the Yehimals.</p>
<p>The tallest mountain on Toril was located in the Yehimal. Cloudspire was located to the south of the Kun-Yen Shan range and exceeded 35,000 feet in height.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Yeti dwelled in the Yehimal, as did some go-zu and me-zu oni . Asperii were also known to roam the Yehimal. As for dragons , t'ien lung made their homes here; conversely, copper dragons were confirmed not to inhabit the Yehimal. The raptorans had carved out cities from the high cliffs of the mountains.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to dwarven legends, the Yehimal was the site of the very first dwarf settlements on Toril , founded some tens of millennia before the 14th century DR , that is, around −16,000 DR . Scholars estimated that they later made a great exodus out of the Yehimal, migrating into the continents of Faerûn, Kara-Tur, and Zakhara and dividing into two or three major branches. The ones who ventured north into Faerûn are theorized to have made their first settlements under the lands that would be known as Semphar , before spreading westward. By −15,000 DR , they'd already founded their first great kingdom, Bhaerynden , beneath the Shaar .</p>
