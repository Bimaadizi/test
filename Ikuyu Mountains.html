<p>The Ikuyu Mountains were a massive mountain range on the isle of Tsukishima in Wa .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Considered by many to be the most beautiful natural feature of Wa, the Ikuyus were high, snow-capped mountains that divided the island of Tsukishima in half from north to south. The mountains covered a full 80% of the island, leaving only the western and eastern portions for civilization. Many of the mountains in the range had summits over 15,000 feet (4,600 meters), and most of them maintained snow and ice cover year round. The range was formed by volcanic activity, and a full 350 of the mountains were volcanoes, many of which were active in 1357 DR .</p>
<p>Two groups of mountains spurring off from the central chain of the Ikuyu Mountains were given separate names—the Jufosu Range and the Origanaya Range . The former mountains were at the southern end of the Ikuyus and were home to monstrous rokuro-kubi . The Origanayas were in the north and were home to korobokuru .</p>
<p>At the feet of the mountains were verdant, green forests. Many of the extinct volcanoes had peaceful lakes filling their craters.</p>
<p>There were a number of passes through the mountains from east to west, but many of them were extremely hazardous to use. A good number of these were located in Aru Province .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Two explorers from Chozawa named Kuyu Guhbio and Funitabi Hichi set out to map the entire mountain range. By Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR) , they were known to have mapped most of the region south of Chozawa, an impressive feat. It is not known whether they ever finished their epic task.</p>
<h2>Rumors and Legends</h2>
<p>The spirit of Samon , the fabled wandering shukenja , haunted the mountains around the Hayatura Road, for it was here that he was said to have given up his oaths of chastity to marry a peasant maiden who was actually a serpent.</p>
<p>Some believed that the Ikuyus were the location of the mythical River of Three Routes , where all mortal spirits of Wa traveled when they died. Those who believed this usually guessed that the river was located near Mount Matazan.</p>
<p>The Ikuyus were the setting of the famous noh play The Narrow Road to the Sea of Blossoms , which tells the story of a disgraced samurai general who made a death march through the mountains.</p>
