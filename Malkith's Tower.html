<p>Malkith's Tower was the tower where the Magister Malkith Undree lived until his death on 302 DR . It was destroyed just under seven years after his death.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The tower was somewhere in the Starspire Mountains .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>After Malkith's death, at least one room's stones had melted and then fused again.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Malkith Undree used this tower as a dwelling, study, and laboratory.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Around 309 DR , adventurers exploring it set off a chain of meteor swarms that was powerful enough to blast the tower down.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The tower was in use by Malkith Undree at the time of his death in 302 DR ; he accidentally killed himself with an enchanted scepter that exploded. The power of the explosion was such that his body was fused to the ground, the stones around him were reduced to fused glass around the frozen remains of the scepter, and his head was nowhere to be found. Almost seven years later, in 302 DR , adventurers entered his tower and set off a chain of meteor swarms that blasted the tower down to rubble. From time to time afterwards, even unto the late 14 th century DR , strange blue glows still flickered close to it.</p>
