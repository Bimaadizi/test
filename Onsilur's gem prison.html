<p>Onsilur's Gem Prison was a kiira of a forgotten elven house that was used to imprison Onsilur Maerdrathom at some point between 321 DR and 326 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The kiira belonged to a house unknown as of the late 14 th century DR . Ansel Burwyth employed it to trap Onsilur Maerdrathom inside at some point before 326 DR , and hid the gem. It was still unfound by the late 14 th century DR, by which point Onsilur went insane after being trapped inside for so long.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Onsilur's sentience faintly babbled out from inside the gem in the form of speech or descriptions of memories stored inside the kiira .</p>
