<p>Xorhun , also known as Corellon's Cradle and Lifeblood Falls , was a special city in the Turmish area, on the edge of the Halondar Valley . This community of elves and gnomes hearkened back to the communities of the ancient elven civilization.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Xorhun served as the garden spot of the non- human population, especially elves , having an unusual effect on elves and gnomes , increasing their fertility rate. Children were born at a rate two to three times the norm for their race. One must live in the area for five years before the fertility effects began to show.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Xorhun served primarily as a stopping point along the Halondar , the road that connected Hlondeth to the south and Alaghôn to the north. It was populated primarily by craftsmen and merchants.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The city of Xorhun was established before 270 DR . It was believed the city was inhabited by eladrin , who migrated to the city of Myth Drannor . By the Year of the Unmasked Traitor, 522 DR , Xorhun became known as an environmentalist community after thirty elves from the city joined the delegation of druids of the Gulthmere Forest in the capital of Alaghôn . The delegation requested that Turmishans cease logging as deforestation was going faster than the forest could naturally replenish. In response, Arton Githsberry called a meeting with the Lords of Turmish , a shallow act that was done to appease the druids but not to stop the logging operations.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Xorhun was the only open elven city in the Vilhon Reach . Predominantly elven, the city was home to a large community of gnomes, and a very small number of humans and half-elves . In the 15 th century DR , a kobold tribe from the Orsraun Mountains found a new home in Xorhun's ghetto that became known as the Koboldtown.</p>
