<p>The Docker's Guild of Baldur's Gate was the organization that represented and self-governed the dockworkers of the Lower City in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the Docker's Guild had a standing agreement with the infamous Guild , a criminal origination of Little Calimshan . The chairwoman of the Docker's Guild paid the Guild's thugs to protect cargo that entered and left the harbors of Baldur's Gate via trading vessels. With the rise of the Cult of the Absolute , the newly implemented steel watchers and the Flaming Fist cracked down on smuggling and closely inspected all shipments that moved through the Gate's docks. This scrutiny scared off a significant number of traders, reducing commerce, which, in turn, reduced the Docker's Guild's capability to pay the Guild.</p>
