<p>Gladiator's clubs were magic blunt weapons often crafted using ironwood .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>There were various gladiator's clubs of somewhat similar form and power. Most were just powerful magic weapons that dealt bludgeoning damage, but some rarer gladiator's clubs could leave the opponent dazed after a successful hit.</p>
<p>A gladiator's club could be created from an enchanted club and a slab of ironwood.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Possibly the original gladiator's club belonged to a champion gladiator of Chessenta , Jorag Muthkik . He was a slave, like other warriors in the gladiator pits, and belonged to a wizard . Jorag's master always outfitted him with the best equipment to make sure the gladiator always won. The gladiator's club was a gift the master gave to Jorag after a win that earned the wizard a fortune. Jorag Muthkik survived into his old age, and after retiring from the pits, he made a living at one of the top gladiator schools in Chessenta, using his gladiator's club to punish his students instead of opponents.</p>
<p>One of these magic clubs was created during the Wailing Death epidemic of Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR in Neverwinter . Master blacksmith Marrok of Shining Knight Arms and Armor created it using ironwood for the Hero of Neverwinter .</p>
<p>Another gladiator's club was created in 1372 DR by dwarf blacksmith Barun in the Uthgardt village Beorunna's Well . The club bore his mark and was later used against Lady Aribeth the Betrayer's forces when she led them against the Lords' Alliance .</p>
<p>During Gorgomorz and the Zhentarim 's plot against Daggerford that year, one of the gladiator's clubs bearing the mark of Marrok found its way into the hands of a goblin chieftain allied with Gorgomorz's tanarukka forces.</p>
