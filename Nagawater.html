<p>The Nagawater was a large, deep freshwater lake located in Sespech on the Golden Plains , named after a large population of water nagas that lived in the southern part the lake.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A line of buoys lit with continual flame spells marked the boundary between the north half of the lake that humans inhabited and the southern part left for the nagas .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Naga Plains occupied the lands between the Golden Plains and the Nagawater. West of the Nagawater laid the Serpents' Holding , a band of plains inhabited by nomads, nagas, and spitting snakes . The northern parts of the lake laid in the region known as the Nagalands .</p>
<p>The Nagaflow river fed Nagawater, bringing waters from the depths of the Chondalwood . The Nagawater was connected to the Deepwash lake and eventually with the Vilhon Reach via the Wintercloak River .</p>
<h2>Flora & Fauna</h2>
<p>The lake is inhabited by a community of water and guardian nagas , giving its name justice. The naga community was affiliated with the Order of the Grand Snakemaster and advised by the order's Elder Serpent Ashassae , who offered an invaluable but corrupt council in attempts to sway the community to Set worship. The nagas also had an agreement with the humans of Ormpetarr , who left the serpent creatures in peace to their part of the lake, in exchange for the nagas filling the city's nets with ample lake fish. Nagas of the Nagalands lacked official government. By the late-14 th century DR , banelar nagas started joining the naga community of the Nagawater, and their number continued to grow steadily. The upper reaches of Nagaflow were used by the region nagas as a spawning ground.</p>
<p>The western banks of the lake were the home of mlarraun , also known as "spitting snakes."</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the century that followed the calamity of the Spellplague , Vilhon Reach was devastated by wild magics, becoming known as the Vilhon Wilds . By the Year of the Ring, 1393 DR , the Nagawaters lake was already consumed by the Vilhon Wilds. However, that disastrous change of the landscape was not permanent. With the Spellplague's end and the goddess of magic Mystra 's return during the Second Sundering , that started in the Year of the Narthex Murders, 1482 DR , the lands of Vilhon Reach were restored to Toril , damage done to the world was healed, and wild magics of the Plaguewrought Land â€“ wiped by the goddess's hand.</p>
