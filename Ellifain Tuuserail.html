<p>Ellifain Tuuserail , also known as Le'lorinel Tel'e'brenequiette , was a moon elf in the Moonwood .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Being a silver elf , Ellifain had black hair with a bluish tint and very pale skin flecked with blue. Her eyes were shimmering azure with gold sparkles.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Since surviving the drow raid, Ellifain developed an irrational hatred for Drizzt Do'Urden, labeling him as a false hero feigning goodness and friendship. Her irrationality was so intense that she vowed to destroy the entire drow race if she had the power, even the children.</p>
<h2>Equipment</h2>
<p>Surviving in the wilds of the Moonwood, Ellifain wore a forest green cloak , brown leggings , and a tunic . She would dress for battle armed with a longbow and a thin sword . She wore a magic ring imbued with a small arsenal of spells , including increased speed, invisibility , and even an enchantment that mirrored damage back upon the attacker.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Her mother was killed by a drow raiding party including Drizzt Do'Urden when she was a young child. Ellifain survived the raid when Drizzt smeared her with her mother's blood to make it look like she was mortally wounded, so the other drow would leave her alone.</p>
<p>Afterward, Ellifain continued living with the elves of the Moonwood, but was scarred by the traumatic event, despite the efforts of clerics and wizards to restore her mental state. When she heard rumors of a drow with lavender eyes who had come to live on the surface, she was consumed with thoughts of revenge. In 1357 DR , she encountered Drizzt as he was traveling through the Moonwood.</p>
<p>She decided to kill Drizzt Do'Urden for what she thought he did. The elves tried to persuade her not to, but her thoughts of revenge were too tempting as she hatched a plan to kill Drizzt. The pair were to meet again in the Moonwood, when Tarathiel and other elves had to hold her back to stop her from attacking. Ellifain later disappeared, traveling to Silverymoon in an effort to hire a swordsman capable of the two-long-weapons fighting style favored by Drizzt whom she could train against.</p>
<p>Eventually, in the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR , Ellifain found a swordsman who used two scimitars to practice against and obtained an ensorcelled ring to aid her. Acting on the visions of the gnome diviner E'kressa to seek out the mark of Aegis-fang , Ellifain traveled to Luskan , where she became a follower of Sheila Kree .</p>
<p>Ellifain was later confronted by Kree after the pirate learned her underling, Gayselle Wayfarer , met her end at the hands of Drizzt and Catti-Brie in Captain Deudermont 's house in Waterdeep . As she was forcibly branded with Kree's mark, Ellifain convinced her of her mission to kill the drow.</p>
<p>Later, when Bellany Tundash forcibly brought Morik the Rogue to Golden Cove after learning of his encounter with Drizzt, Ellifain forced him to re-enact his brief fight with the drow. She remained evasive about her motives for vengeance when questioning by the rogue. Unaware of her gender, Morik tried to convince her to give up on her vengeance, as she would not likely survive a fight with Drizzt, and instead find a lover for herself. However, Ellifain ranted on her mental construct of Drizzt, convinced he was an imposter hero who was as wicked as his kind, and irrationally vowed that if he retreated to the Underdark , she would pursue him and annihilate the entire drow race if she had the power. Morik then conceded to continue to train her for her eventual confrontation with Drizzt.</p>
<p>Later, when Kree's ogre ally, Chogurugga brought forth the corpse of her son Bathunk , who had gone out on a raid at Auckney , Ellifain realized he'd been killed by a scimitar and concluded that the drow was coming to Golden Cove, though Kree remained skeptical.</p>
<p>When the Companions of the Hall assaulted the cove, Ellifain awaited with Chogurugga's mate, Bloog, and watched as the ogre battled Drizzt using Aegis-fang. At some point during the fight, she got bored and aided the drow in killing the ogre. After Drizzt sent Regis away with the hammer, Ellifain proceeded to duel Drizzt, despite the drow's reluctance to indulge her vengeance; because she was masked, Drizzt didn't recognize her but could not help but suspect something familiar about her. At the climax of their duel, Ellifain triggered her magic ring's invisibility function, prompting Drizzt to cast a globe of darkness , resulting in both of them fatally wounding each other. As they sat across from each other, Drizzt observed her feminine figure and removed her mask and reacted with shock upon realizing her identity. In turn, Ellifain triumphantly declared she had avenged her family, though Drizzt couldn't find the words to explain that he took no part in the massacre. As they were found by Bruenor Battlehammer , Catti-Brie and Guenhwyvar , Drizzt urged his friends to save Ellifain. However, Catti-Brie instead gave him a healing potion, while Ellifain expired at the same time.</p>
<p>The Companions later buried Ellifain in the cave complex as near to the exit and the night sky as possible. Drizzt deeply regretted her death, lamenting that she should be alive to move past her vengeance.</p>
<p>Later, her spectre was summoned and she realized the truth only in death, that Drizzt had been her savior from the merciless blades of the drow.</p>
