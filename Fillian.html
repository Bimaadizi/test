<h2>History</h2>
<p>Fillian's stall was set up in Dagerford's River Quarter from where he was commonly seen pushing his wares to thirstily sailors and pirates circa 1372 DR. The gnome used herbs picked in the vicinity of the Boareskyr Bridge for his ungodly concoctions. During one such foraging expedition, Fillian encountered a hungry stone giant who was dead-set on eating the little gnome. The giant grabbed Fillian, getting ready to swallow him raw, but the gnome uncorked his strongest brew and pure down the stone giant's maw. The giant instantly went comatose. Or so Fillian said. This adventure gave the eccentric gnome his main sales pitch, that his brew could bring down a giant and put hair on elf 's chest.</p>
