<p>Maztica ( pronounced : / m ɑː z ˈ t i k ɑː / mahz-TEE-ka ) was one of the two elder deities in the Maztican pantheon . She was the mother of the gods, and the goddess of the earth and life itself. Some sages speculated that she was an overgod .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was considered the epitome of fertile womanhood and therefore she was shown as a lush and full woman with a round and always-smiling face. Maztica was also the embodiment of the land itself in a way.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Maztica was the wife of the god Kukul , and the mother of Qotal , Zaltec , Azul , Tezca , Plutoq , Kiltzi , Watil , and Nula . After Zaltec gave the humans hishna magic , she was saddened at the suffering they brought upon themselves, so she helped her eldest son, Qotal, create pluma magic , which brought peace to the humans. However, Zaltec was furious at her for that and rose up and struck her down with his maca , after which she was not heard from again.</p>
<h2>Worship</h2>
<p>Maztica's priests were much like druids, and were most often found as shamans in small tribes. The city-dwelling Mazticans and priests of other gods tended to ignore her. However, the Dog People in the northern desert worshiped her and her son Tezca more than other deities.</p>
