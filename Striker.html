<p>Striker staves were enchanted quarterstaves wielded by wizard - priests of Talassan faith.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Striker staves were created out of old oak trees, downed by fierce storms sent by Talos . When the Striker staves were crafted, they still carried blackened burns from Talos' wrath.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
