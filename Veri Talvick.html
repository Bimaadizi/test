<p>Veri Talvick was one of the neighbors of the ex- Harper thief named Edgin Darvis in the town of Targos , active in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Veri Talvick and her husband Jon lived next door to Edgin and were friends of his deceased wife Zia . When Ed was left alone with a newborn, the Talvicks happily babysat young Kira . Jon and Veri's nine-year-old daughter Miriam adored the newborn and happily took care of her when Edgin needed help.</p>
<p>Veri and her family babysat Kira when Edgin and his new friend Holga Kilgore embarked on their first heist – Pendro's Pawnshop in Targos. Nine years later, Jon and Veri's youngest child – Sief , accompanied his father to the Trip and Shuffle tavern for dinner, while Veri and Miriam kept an eye on Kira. To the family's horror, Sief was grabbed by a band of robbing marauding gnolls and left Jon hurt with a broken ankle.</p>
<p>Edgin, Holga, and their new thieving ally – Forge Fitzwilliam , set out to find the marauders and recover the group's stolen gold , unaware of a kidnapped child. After a wild fight and cunning use of hungry stirges , Sief was rescued and returned to the Talvicks. The deed made Edgin and his crew Targos' heroes.</p>
