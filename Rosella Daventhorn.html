<p>Rosella Daventhorn was an antiquarian who joined the Cormanthor Elves during the reclamation of Myth Drannor in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Rosella had short blonde hair and pale eyes. She wore a dark blue dress with moon symbology.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1374 DR , Rosella and her mother Valanice joined the Myth Drannor outskirts camp to examine the relics brought out of the ruins. One day, Rosella wandered off on her own to find adventure, and instead of death found a perfectly intact shortbow that defied the typical state of things. These golden age weapons and their fallen age cousins became a particular interest of the mother and daughter, and they would trade and swap for these items when adventurers brought them out of the ruins.</p>
