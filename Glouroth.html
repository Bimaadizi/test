<p>Glouroth was a mature adult Shadow dragon that resided in the Deep Wastes between the Lake of Shadows and Maerimydra . He made his lair in the Wailing Cliff , an odd place where the Plane of Shadow bled into the Material Plane .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ever slinking in the darkness of his lair, Glouroth generally cloaks himself in shadows to mask his appearance.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Beneath a veneer of charm and serenity Glouroth is a being of roiling hatred and rage. When conversing with others the shadow dragon murmurs soothing platitudes in a hissing whisper, all the while consumed with thoughts of gore and death.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In his younger years Glouroth dallied with a group of Kir-lanans , even managing to father a daughter from them in the form of the Half-dragon , Phaikkul .</p>
<p>In 1372 DR , drow refugees from the beseiged city of Maerimydra called upon an ancient pact they had with the dragon to grant them safe passage past the Wailing Cliff .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h3>Kir-lanan</h3>
<p>Although Glouroth lived with two groups of Kir-lanan, who both payed homage to him in certain ways, he took little notice of them beyond the offerings the occasionaly brought him.</p>
<h3>Drow</h3>
<p>As the lair of Glouroth resided upon the main route between the city of Maerimydra and the drow outpost of Szith Morcane , this meant that they had to come to a certain number of arrangements concerning their realtionship. This took the form of a pact which meant the drow could garner free passage from both the kir-lanans and Glouroth through the Wailing Cliff. In addition, priestesses of Lolth knew a further stipulation of the pact that meant they could speak a code word to the shadow dragon telling him "I am a captive, please destroy my captors".</p>
