<p>Axelcrantz was a dwarf mystic in 1484 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Just after the start of the War of the Silver Marches , Axelcrantz sensed a menace caused by a drow artifact in the Underdark near the city. He sensed that to recover this object he needed a particular adventuring party that would arrive in Mithral Hall in some time.</p>
<p>However, followed by two drow , Axelcrantz abandoned Mithril Hall. He left a letter and orders that it be delivered to the adventurers when they arrived. In the letter, he predicted that they would meet in Citadel Adbar . All went as he had foreseen and Axelcrantz met the adventurers in Citadel Adbar, explaining about the artifact they needed to destroy.</p>
<p>Studying the recovered Wand of Tir'Lien and thanks to visions sent by Moradin , Axelcrantz discovered the drow wanted to use the Fell Fortress , at the border of the Shadowfell , to summon an undead army. He hired the adventuring party to stop this evil plan. Thanks to the Wand, the Fell Fortress was sealed.</p>
<p>Later, Axelcrantz went to Blingdenstone and called the adventurers, asking them to investigate problems in the trade between the deep gnome city and Gracklstugh .</p>
