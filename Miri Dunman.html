<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Miri was deployed to guard and monitor the ruins of Tilverton and the Moonsea Ride on Cormyr's northern frontier. When her scouts reported orcish raiders at the nearby Netherese ruins , Steel Regent Alusair Obarskyr assigned Lord Falzo Hawklin to resolving the situation. He in turn hired trustworthy adventurers, who delved the ruins and discovered the presence of a large portal network tied to the ruins of Blister .</p>
