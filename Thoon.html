<p>Thoon was perhaps a deity or some other entity which was venerated by a specific group of mind flayers , or it could have been a guiding philosophy just as well.</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>The mind flayers traveled the Underdark , where they spread the philosophy of Thoon. Along the way, they searched for a mysterious substance they called quintessence , which could be found in creatures as well as in raw materials. Thoon disciples had access to the evil and war domains and wielded heavy flails .</p>
<p>Other "worshipers" of Thoon were the various oddities created by its original followers: shadow flayers , Thoon infiltrators , Thoon thralls , madcrafters , all lead by the Thoon elder brain .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Not long after the last arrival of an avatar of Ilsensine in Oryndoll , some mind flayers of the Loretaker Creed went on a pilgrimage to the Cavern of Thought in the Deep Caverns . There was no record if they arrived there or went to some other place, such as the Far Realm . When they came back to Oryndoll, they proclaimed the belief in Thoon - a doctrine for which they were outcast by the clergy of Ilsensine.</p>
