<p>The Tenasu Ferry was a ferry route between the fortress-island of Quelpart and the city of Tu Pe , lying between Kang Bay and the Sea of Kozakura .</p>
<p>The fortress and armada based there depended on daily barges via the Tenasu ferries from Tu Pe, including for supplies of fresh water.</p>
<p>The ferry route (and behind it, Tu Pe's floating city) was guarded by massive stone bastions or bulwarks. Hundreds of birds nested atop these, giving Tu Pe its nickname, "the city of the birds".</p>
