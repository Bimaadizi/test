<p>Trifin Creek was a swiftly flowing small river with steep banks. Its source was near the Snakewood , and it flowed mainly southward until it merged with the River Rimril and then joined the Amstel River past Eshpurta . There were a few places where the current slowed enough to allow fishing.</p>
<p>A bridge at the end of the Eshpurta Road from Athkatla crossed the creek providing access to the southwest gate of Eshpurta, being one of the three bridges of the "Three Bridges Way".</p>
