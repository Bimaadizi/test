<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Ryanna and Moria killed a married couple and their two handymen who had just finished renovating the abandoned Journey's Rest inn. Deciding to let their prey come to them, the vampires took up the inn for themselves and hired the barmaids Maris and Cora . Their first attempt was on the necromancer Ratakos , who easily overpowered them and was then immediately offered a better deal. Ratakos would create undead that would attack travelers, prompting them to take shelter instead of passing by the inn. Ryanna and Moria would drain and kill the customer, and Ratakos would then receive the fresh body for his necromantic studies.</p>
<p>This new plan came apart within the month, when the merchant Portis Alvermantle fled the inn after suspecting something was wrong, Lord Rhyn Mournsoul and Alanis Dirgesong were too important to risk killing, and the only other potential victims were a group of adventurers. Depending on how the adventurers protected themselves, Ryanna and Moria either bided their time, or attacked and were driven out of the Journey's Rest.</p>
