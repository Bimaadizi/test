<p>Wall-walkers were a species of predatory, subterranean creatures that resembled a cross between spiders and reptiles . There was no known evidence of these creatures living in the Realms.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The bodies of these creatures were largely spider-like, sporting sharp pincers and eight spindly clawed legs that they used to scoop at dirt and rocks. They had a stinging tail at the end of their body and were covered in armored, reptilian scales. On average they grew to be 5 feet (1.5 meters) in length.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Wall-walkers delighted in frightening and playing with their prey before finishing them, using their abilities to do so. They would move in close to paralyzed prey and stare into their eyes, moving their mandibles back and forth in a threatening manner. If they ever faced a foe that was seeming difficult to defeat, they would flee in search of easier prey.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>These creatures possessed a number of innate psionic abilities. These included catfall , contact , feel light , feel sound , mind blank , and shadow-form . One of their unique psionic abilities mimicked chameleons , making their scales take on the color and texture of nearby surfaces. Beyond these abilities a wall-walker was impervious to harm from fire and carried a paralyzing poison in its stinger.</p>
