<p>A tocken was a set of wooden carved oval open-ended bells that could be played either with hammers or open handed. There was also a version that used silver bells that was popular in Waterdeep in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Wooden tockens were often made of phandar . Tockens were usually mounted hanging from a crossbeam of cane or a wooden branch (sometimes the whole thing was attached to a pole) and struck with mallets. Their sound was very pleasant and brought out subtle tones from the wood, which made them popular in underground cultures because of resonating properties that could make their sound carry further. Silver tockens were primarily available in Waterdeep, manufactured by the Majarra noble family.</p>
<p>Wooden tockens were available for purchase through Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue .</p>
