<p>The Incanistaeum was a famous academy of magic in the city of Myth Drannor , whose secret was hidden to those who merely passed by. It was an entire community of mages and other practitioners of the Art , a town contained within the City of Song.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The school was located on Phelindra Street within the city's multicultural district of Dlabraddath .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>By all appearances, the exterior of the Incanistaeum as a solid stone structure of fine dwarven construction. Only the keen eyes of a dwarf could determine that something about the building appeared "off".</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The Incanistaeum was in fact "built" to comprise a great number of duo-dimensional spaces that added up to over 300 separate rooms and chambers, set across seven different floors.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The driving purposed of the Incanistaeum was to serve as a place where practitioners from all the races of Myth Drannor could study magic by instructors that were not all of elven heritage. Its founding members and first teachers were the noted mages that formed the Icanists' Society , also known as the Seven Wizards of Myth Drannor.</p>
<p>Unfortunately due to the nature of its founding, the Incanistaeum became a site for racial-politics between the city's more narrow-minded elves and members of its student body.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Incanistaeum was established in late 4 th century DR , in the Year of Seven Stars, 379 DR . For over three hundred years the academy's faculty offered their wisdom and knowledge to its students, including the first and future Blackstaff , Khelben Arunsun , and the were-tiger archmage Tulrun .</p>
<p>In the midâ€“7 th century the academy saw departure of some of its founding instructors, including Pyraan the Grim and Peridar Snowbrows in the Year of the Baleful Song, 663 DR , and Taeral Olortynaal who left two years later by the urging of his family.</p>
<p>Taeral would return about a decade later, in the Year of Gruesome Grimoires, 676 DR , but was accidental killed in a spell battle between elves and humans. Sun elf students framed Taeral's death on the Incanistaeum's last remaining non-elven student, Arlesn of Cormyr , who was banished from Myth Drannor forever.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Howling, 682 DR , the only remaining instructor of the Incanistaeum was Sakaala of the Seven Rings . Both Mentor Wintercloak and the individual known as the Masked had departed Myth Drannor and taken with them their four remaining students. The Incanistaeum was finally disbanded some eight years later in the Year of the Clashing Blades, 690 DR , after Sakaala and her three apprentices left the city once and for all.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Unlike other magical academies in Myth Drannor during its time, the Incanistaeum admitted students and apprentices from any of the numerous races that took up residence within the city.</p>
