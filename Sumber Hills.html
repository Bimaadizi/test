<p>The Sumber Hills were a range of hills in the middle of the Dessarin Valley . The River Dessarin flowed through the hills, providing a source of water travel between Yartar and downstream communities such as Beliard , Bargewright Inn , and Womford . The Larch Path and the Dessarin Road provided passage through the hills.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>One of the first settlements in the Sumber Hills was the underground city of Tyar-Besil , a part of the shield dwarf kingdom of Besilmer . Tyar-Besil was abandoned and fell into ruin in −4190 DR , after the king of Besilmer died in battle.</p>
<p>The Sumber Hills were left alone until the Knights of the Silver Horn started clearing the area of its native inhabitants in the Year of the Raised Sword, 893 DR . The knights attempted to set up fortresses in the hills but were stopped by Uruth Ukrypt . These events eventually played a part in the Orcfastings War , and the First and Second Trollwars .</p>
<p>Around the Year of the Wailing Winds, 1000 DR , settlements started springing up around the Sumber Hills, creating roads and trails that bisected the hills.</p>
