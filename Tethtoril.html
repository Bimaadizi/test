<p>Tethtoril was the First Reader of Candlekeep as of 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was known to be wise and soft spoken. Tethtoril was a tall man who was often mistaken for Ulraunt the Keeper of the Tomes . To Ulraunt's great disdain, Tethtoril was more stately, intelligent, and better liked than his haughty superior.</p>
<p>Tethtoril was dedicated to his duties and loved Candlekeep, always trying to protect the citadel and its inhabitants from trouble or embarrassments.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Tethtoril was a powerful cleric who, if need arose, could defend himself with call lightning and flame strike spells.</p>
<p>Without him knowing, the old cleric was protected by three deities. When he was in danger, Mystra sent him any spell he needed, a wall of force was manifested by Oghma , and Deneir summoned a magical symbol , making him one of the most well protected beings in the Realms.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Tethtoril was friendly with Firebead Elvenhair - a traveling wizard who often visited the citadel of Candlekeep, while Gorion and Abdel Adrian were his close acquaintances.</p>
<p>It was believed that Mystra, the Mother of All Magic, communed with Tethtoril in his dreams and guided his research, often leading him to finding rare and precious spells tucked and hidden deep in the tomes and dusty shelves of the grand library.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tethtoril's career and status was gained thanks to subtle guidance by the three gods who shielded him from harm - Mystra, Oghma, and Deneir. They aided the cleric in his scholarly research and deciphering obscure and ancient writings, eventually gaining him the position of the First Reader of Candlekeep.</p>
<p>In 1368 DR , Tethtoril borrowed a spell scroll from the visiting Firebead Elvenhair. The wizard asked Abdel to retrieve it for him.</p>
