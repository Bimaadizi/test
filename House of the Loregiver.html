<p>The House of the Loregiver was a sacred site to Enlightened Zakharans found within the Golden Mosque in Huzuz in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This building could be found in the Pilgrims' District of the City of Delights.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The actual physical structure of the House of the Loregiver was not impressive since it was a simple one-room house made from clay.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Since pilgrims enjoyed taking souvenirs from the house, many magical protections were put in place to protect the remaining structure. A wall of force surrounded the house. Those who were able to circumvent the wall were met with a magical feeling of dread. Those who pressed further were confronted with four noble genies , one for each elemental type. Anyone able to strike the house with malicious intent was instantly paralyzed.</p>
<p>Additionally, an honor guard of priests guarded the house at all times.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Many Zakharans believed that this house was the dwelling of the woman who would become the Loregiver . However, other opinions existed as well.</p>
<p>A sect of radical Zannites believed the location was only a house that existed during the time of the Loregiver. All believed that the house was where the first Grand Caliph experienced a vision that led him to the Loregiver's scrolls .</p>
<p>Many believed that being near the house helped ease their pain, though sages thought this was simple superstition.</p>
