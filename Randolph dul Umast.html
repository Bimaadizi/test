<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the temple of The Lady's Favor was built in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Randolph dul Umast was appointed its first high priest by his superiors at the Lady's Happy Hall in Procampur . He demonstrated himself to be a wise and capable leader of the local priesthood.</p>
<p>Around Kythorn of the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , a convoy secretly transported the torque of faith , a holy item of Tymora , to The Lady's Favor. However, the Vipers gang of bandits attacked the convoy, massacred its guardians, and looted its wealth, including the torque. The Tymorans in Procampur were outraged and Randolph hired the ranger Dura Gerathu to locate the Vipers' Nest .</p>
<p>On Eleint 1 in 1369 DR, one of the hamlet's wells was poisoned, killing a few villagers and sickening twenty-two more. The priests of Tymora treated them but found that their magic could do nothing to identify or cure the poison, and they were forced to rely on non-magical treatments. Randolph communed with Tymora for advice and then sought adventurers to seek the poison's ingredients or a cure, and return the torque of faith if they should find it.</p>
