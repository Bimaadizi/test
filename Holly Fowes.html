<p>Holly Fowes was an investigative journalist who wrote for the Baldur's Mouth broadsheet from the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Holly Fowes had been working at the Baldur's Mouth Gazette until the Absolute crisis of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . She realized that the broadsheet's new sponsor, Lord Enver Gortash , was in control of the information being dispensed by Ettvard Needle 's publication. In one of her articles to be published, Holly wrote a scathing opinion on Lord Gortash and the rot at the core of Baldur's Gate he represented. She fully understood that penning the article meant losing her job, and she signed the manuscript as a "Newly Freelance" journalist and for Ettvard to consider it a letter of resignation. The editor-in-chief, Ettvard Needle, immediately discharged Holly, citing her work to be libelous behavior, conspiracy, and intimidation, and herself to be "a toxic, unjournalistic presence in the workplace." Ettvard did not accept her resignation and instead fired Holly without pay and threatened her future work with legal action.</p>
