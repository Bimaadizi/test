<p>The House of the Moon was a large temple of Selûne in Thentia .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple was located towards the inland, northern side of Thentia, on a main road running towards the coast.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The temple was built from white marble and alabaster with silver trim. The domed, vaulted ceiling of the sanctuary was a painted midnight blue field with dramatic depictions of the lunar phases.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1194 DR , the temple performed an inquest into the deaths of three priestesses in Glister who were suspected of being part of the New Moon Heresy . The sisters Fela , Iwna , and Mirela Thesk were cleared of all suspicions and declared innocent.</p>
<p>In 1345 DR it became the sole major temple in Thentia when the Zhentarim blew up the temple of Waukeen during a heist.</p>
<p>Around 1376 DR , the temple experienced a surge in popularity as witnesses claimed to see Selûne gliding above the waves of the sea, and sailors who defended her name in brawls received a glowing boon on their weapons.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In 1376 DR the temple was overseen by Sureene Aumratha and 34 lesser priests and priestesses. She was also assisted by two sorcerous sisters, Jannatha Goldenshield and Baerimel Dunnath , who performed investigations for Sureene.</p>
