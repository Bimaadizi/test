<p>Dreammist , also known as mordayn vapor , was a hallucinogenic drug derived from the rare mordayn herb.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When mordayn was steeped in boiling water, it produced a tea that released the dreammist vapor. This vapor was considered highly addictive, and deadly if taken incorrectly.</p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>When dreammist was inhaled, it entranced the user with visions of profound beauty for a matter of minutes. During this time, the imbiber could not readily function as they were so distracted by the poignant and bewitching sights.</p>
<p>After the effect wore off, the user's normal life seemed so boring and mundane that they often felt compelled to find a second dose. If this occurred within an hour of the first, it often proved to be fatal. Regular users often disposed of the tea immediately after their first inhalation, so as not to be tempted for a quick second fix.</p>
