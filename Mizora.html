<p>Mizora was a cambion of the Nine Hells who remained active in the Realms during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Like many other half- devils , Mizora was a cunning and manipulative individual. Haughty and smug, she seemed to take great pleasure in exerting control over others. She was a shrewd negotiator, being especially fond of offering gifts that came with terrible strings attached.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Mizora forged an infernal pact with Wyll Ravengard , also known as the Blade of Frontiers. She often ordered Wyll to slay devils and other creatures that interfered her or her mistress's plan in the Sword Coast. She would reward Wyll if the demand was fulfilled, or punish him if he did not obey the contract terms.</p>
<p>Mizora was a devoted member of the inner circle of Zariel , the archdevil of Avernus . She craved attention from her mistress, which made her jealous of Karlach Cliffgate , a tiefling warrior who was forced to serve Zariel. Zariel seemed to treasure Karlach, despite the tiefling being undeserving in Mizora's eyes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the year 1485 DR , Mizora received a demand from her mistress Zariel to prevent Tiamat and her dragon cultists' scheme of manifesting the dragon queen upon the city Baldur's Gate , as Zariel had her own plans for the city. Mizora approached Wyll Ravengard , the son of Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard , and convinced him that he needed her power in order to stop the cultists and save the city. Wyll agreed to a warlock pact in exchange for his soul. He then fought the cultists and successfully stopped the ritual of summoning. In the years that followed, Mizora regularly commanded Wyll to slaughter other devils that interfered with her schemes.</p>
<p>In the year 1492 DR , Mizora received information about Karlach 's plan of fleeing from the Hells. Seeing this as an opportunity to gain favor from Zariel while also disposing of a perceived rival, Mizora sent Wyll into Avernus to hunt down Karlach.</p>
