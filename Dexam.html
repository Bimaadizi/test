<p>Dexam was a capricious beholder ally of Fzoul Chembryl of the Zhentarim in the mid-14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Dexam had a lair within Zhentil Keep where he was served by a hooded woman (secretly a medusa ) and a small gang of minotaurs . In the same year, Dexam sought to uncover the secret of the creation of the azure bonds , magical tattoos that could create unwilling slaves. The fickle beholder came to a conflict with a group of heroes branded with the bonds. Some said the beholder disintegrated Fzoul Chembryl over the secret. However, that was untrue, as the leader of the Zhentarim reappeared unharmed shortly after.</p>
