<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tarthe Maermir was the one who came across a merchant's account regarding the location of Ondil's Tower , and led the Brave Blades to the remote, floating redoubt. While inside the tower, he snapped Elmara , the party's cleric of Mystra , from her indecision a few times. After the way behind them disappeared during exploration, forcing them into a path that led exclusively to Ondil's Tomb , Tarthe encouraged them to continue even after Ondil's hanging spells began to slay them at the entrance. After Elmara managed to finally incapacitate Ondil, Tarthe was quickly slain by Undarl Dragonrider , who teleported to their location.</p>
