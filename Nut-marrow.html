<p>Nut-marrow was an edible marrow -like plant.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nut-marrows were akin to other marrows like the courgette and zucchini , but on the inside, they were beige. The taste of their insides was like roast almonds .</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>These plants were grown by many as a food source. They rotted far more slowly than zucchini, and so were easily stored as winter food. They could be fried in thin slices, or in many other ways, such as making lubbath with diced and cooked nut-marrows.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mirt sold two warehouses' full of nut-marrows to Thaglon late in Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , getting fine steel -and- silver Amn -work for it.</p>
