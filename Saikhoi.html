<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Ancient History</h3>
<p>After the land of Khati was annexed by the Imaskari during the height of the Imaskar Empire ( −7975 DR to −6788 DR ), the city of Thakos rose as the capital of the eastern empire through the Middle Kingdoms period ( −6422 DR to −4370 DR ).</p>
<p>The Imaskar Empire fell in −2488 DR , but the eastern provinces Khati and Katakoro emerged relatively unscathed. Thus, in −2487 DR , Kujawa claimed the Dragon Throne in Thakos and declared himself Emperor, founding a new realm, Anok-Imaskar , with Khati at its heart. Kujawa died fighting a great t'ien lung dragon in −1943 DR . His death led to the empire fracturing into warring states, among them the new independent realm called Ra-Khati.</p>
<p>In the centuries to come, however, Thakos would fall into ruins. In −1377 DR , Tan Chin dug through the ruins of Thakos and discovered potent Imaskari artifacts, with which he seized the throne of ancient Shou Lung .</p>
<p>In time, the city would be rebuilt and become known as Saikhoi.</p>
