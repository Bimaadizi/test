<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Brace was very loyal to friends but was liable to hunt a betrayer to the end of the world. He was a little paranoid and distrustful of people he didn't know.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Brace was an adventurer devoted to Tymora but every adventuring party he joined was decimated by monsters. In time, most adventurers said that Brace was "kissed by Beshaba " and nobody wanted him in their party any more. So Brace joined the City Watch to have a regular income and home.</p>
