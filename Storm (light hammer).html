<p>Storm was a variety of enchanted light hammer created on the Sword Coast North in the late 14 th century DR , with its origins dating to the time Cimbar became the capital of Chessenta .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>There existed three variants of the Storm hammer, each possessed a +1 , +2 , and +8 enchantments that made the hammerhead's bludgeoning damage deadlier and guided the wielder's hand towards the target. All three versions were ensorcelled to deal lightning damage with each strike. The +2 and +8 variants also offered the wielder resistance to normal and magical electricity.</p>
<p>Storm could be created from an enchanted light hammer and a diamond .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The oldest and strongest variety of Storm hammers dated to the time it was wielded by the mythical Chessentan hero Cevalias who was enamored by Saphia , the daughter of a ruler of Cimbar, who manipulated the hero and his Storm hammer into becoming instrumental in elevating Cimbar to the status of the nation's capital.</p>
<p>More common versions of Storm with a simpler +1 enchantment were forged by Master Blacksmith Marrok of the Shining Knight Arms and Armor shop of Neverwinter to help the heroes who sought the cure for the dreaded Wailing Death of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Later the same year, more powerful versions were created by Master Blacksmith Barun of Beorunna's Well to help the forces of Neverwinter stand against Lady Aribeth the Betrayer , who led a marching army of Luskan in the deadly but short-lived Neverwinter–Luskan war.</p>
