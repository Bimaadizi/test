<p>Kazoos were musical instruments that greatly entertained the players; however, those who listened often took a dimmer view.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Similar to mundane kazoos, there were enchanted variations that offered even more danger to those exposed to the music. Commonly found in the Nelanther Isles and other locations on the Sea of Swords , enchanted kazoos were created to be used by some especially cruel bards to produce devastating sonic effects similar to that of the sound burst spell.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Apart from some bards, minstrels were known to utilize a wide variety of musical wind instruments. Most were referred to as "pipes" even though in reality they could be several types of instruments, including kazoos.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kazoos were considered a humorous musical instrument by most even though its invention dated back to distant days of forgotten antiquity.</p>
<p>Magical kazoos were in common use in the late 14 th century DR . Notably, Captain Allendry of the Midnight Rose outfitted his crew with them and offered them for sale.</p>
