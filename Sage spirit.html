<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1358 DR , the Heroes of Waterdeep navigated in the deep areas of the Forest Trail on the way to Myth Drannor, but their path was blocked by very thick trees. They were met by the ghostly form of a sage in a clearing, who was angered by the felling of some trees and threatened to kill them. If persuaded to reveal his lore, the spirit revealed that Myth Drannor was once an elven settlement, followed by its prosperity and its downfall. He then revealed that he'd died on the day that Myth Drannor was overwhelmed by monsters. He then gave a test to prove their worthiness of passing to Myth Drannor, which if failed would only make the pathway to Myth Drannor permanently blocked. If the test was passed, he unblocked the way, but told them not to cut down any more trees.</p>
