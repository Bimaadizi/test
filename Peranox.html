<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1357 DR , the Fire Knives attacked Alias while trying to bring her in alive. Afterward, vials of peranox were looted from their bodies, giving her an important clue about the assassins' true intent. The same bottles later found their way into halfling bard Olive Ruskettle 's pockets and gave her an important upper hand in negotiating with the famous red dragon Mistinarperadnacles Hai Draco . Olive threatened to drink the cinnamon-smelling poison before the dragon was to eat her, which would kill the dragon as a result. Eventually, Olive threw the poison bottle into Mist's maw, almost killing the dragon. But Mist's life was saved by a saurial paladin Dragonbait 's healing.</p>
