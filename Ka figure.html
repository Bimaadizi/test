<p>Ka figures , also known as spirit statues , were a variety of funerary statuettes that the people of Sokkar would place inside the tombs of their deceased. They were believed by the Sokkarans to hold the deads' ka ( soul ) once their physical remains were properly mummified and interned. These figures were typically placed alongside a stele , which insured the deceased had a fruitful afterlife.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The details and features of ka figures varied greatly, with the rich and powerful of Sokkar having more intricate and opulent ones. They were made to depict the person whose ka they were meant to hold. In the more elaborate tombs of Sokkar, one could find multiple vaults depicting servants sacrificed to serve in the afterlife, including concubines, dancers, guards, musicians, porters, slaves, wives, and even pets.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Edimu , a beloved horse from Jazirat al-Sayyad , passed from the world a mausoleum was constructed for him in Sokkar. Placed within this mausoleum was a stele, depicting Edimu galavanting in the hills of a fertile island, along with an inscription in Chun that labeled it "Jazirat al-Sayyad." It was accompanied by a life-sized ka figure made of alabaster , adorned with a golden bit and bridle . The bridle was encrusted in diamonds and sapphires , as well as inscribed with Chun runes that bore Edimu's name and wishes for a long, happy afterlife. However, ghouls later looted the chambers and stole the horse's bit and bridle, breaking both his ka figure and stele in the process, and thus untethering his spirit from the afterlife.</p>
<p>In 1367 DR , a group of adventurers came to Sokkar and Edimu's spirit pleaded with them to retrieve his bit and bridle from the ghouls, showing them to his mausoleum and the smashed ka figure within. The adventurers would go on to retrieve the bit and bridle, which Edimu's spirit would lay in his empty sarcophagus, but Edimu then gestured over to his broken ka figure to indicate that his spirit could not rest unless they repaired it. When they eventually do so, the spirit nuzzles them before stepping into the ka figure and vanishing.</p>
