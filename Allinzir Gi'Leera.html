<p>Allinzir Gi'leera was a proxy of Vhaeraun , the Dark Seldarine deity of thievery and treachery. He was also the sole individual among Vhaeraun's proxies — who for their own safety tried to avoid attention and keep their identities secret — that was publicly known.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like all of Vhaeraun's proxies, Allinzir was a male drow .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Allinzir was an incredibly subtle and constantly scheming individual. He carried himself with an air of smooth pleasantness and a cold smile that almost never faltered. He always looked for indirect or roundabout solutions to any problem he faced, even if a straightforward one was available.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Allinzir possessed the same abilities that were given to all of Vhaeraun's proxies. This included trusight , a catlike grace, abilities related to thievery, and abilities related to striking at creatures that could only be harmed by magical weapons.</p>
<p>Unlike other drow, Allinzir was uniquely unaffected by sunlight. And he could disappear into the shadows, even while being watched, then reappear elsewhere.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Allinzir operated in the shadows, working against the machinations of the Dark Seldarine goddess Lolth , just like all proxies of Vhaeraun. Beyond this duty as Vhaeraun's proxy, Allinzir operated as a member of the planar faction known as the Revolutionary League .</p>
