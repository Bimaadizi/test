<h2>History</h2>
<p>These gruesome weapons originated from the jungles of Chult, wielded by its serpentine slavers. In order to keep their "cattle" cooperating, the slavers used swords imbued with deadly poisons on the most spirited captives or on those who were brave enough to attempt an escape. A single cut was enough to make the unruly captives sick and suffering. It often took a promise of antidote to keep poisoned slaves in line. In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , one Blade of Chult was sold in Westgate , among countless unique rare weapons and armor on the city's Market Triangle .</p>
