<p>Zokan Thunderer was the chieftain of the Elk tribe of the Uthgardt in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Zokan was well known for his barbaric nature. He was regarded as possibly the ugliest, rudest, richest, wiliest, and the most feared and hated bandit leader in the North .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>His warriors raided incessantly, at least where the usual tribal migrations of the Elk took them, which ranged around the Evermoors and the plains east of the Dessarin . Under Zokan, almost any traveler or region was fair game, including other Uthgardt tribes. They were suspected of having links to Luskan , and under Zokan clerics of Talos gained ground.</p>
<p>He worshiped Auril and Talos.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>To those outside of his tribe, Zokan was considered to be little more than a vulgar thug.</p>
