<p>Salve of senile serenity , also known as Teodgren's salve of senile serenity , was a magic potion that could temporarily elevate the mind-affecting symptoms of dementia in elderly sentient creatures.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The salve was pleasant-tasting and it immediately cleared the fog from the mind of a creature affected by dementia.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR , Teodgren's salve of senile serenity were mixed and sold by Bellowgulp Bluefingers and the Concocter during their time in Dennaton 's gladiatorial pits of Thay . The salve, which apparently was also effective when ingested, was used by a drow wizard Gezzthemin on the rarely lucid elderly wizard Dulf Ebonbeard . Thanks to the old man's temporarily invigorated mind, the two helped the Champion of Baeloth's Pit to plan the escape and ways to cripple the Red Wizard 's Planar Hunters .</p>
