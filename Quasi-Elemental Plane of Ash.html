<p>The Quasi-Elemental Plane of Ash was the Inner Plane at the intersection of the Elemental Plane of Fire and the Negative Energy Plane . It was a place that sucked the warmth from any living creature.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In most areas of this plane the ash had the consistency of hard-packed soil, though in some regions it was much less dense.</p>
<p>The cooling cinders within the air of this plane sucked the warmth from not only living creatures, but from magical effects as well. This made long term spells such as heat metal and wall of fire ineffective on this plane. These cinders also gradually deteriorated the health of creatures of elemental fire and magma.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Records found inside of an abandoned citadel on the world of Oerth hint that a community of dwarves may have tried to establish a colony in this plane, though their fate was unknown.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The two most predominant sentient species on this plane were ash mephits and ash quasi-elementals. The former lived in scattered communities, while the latter had a substantial empire centered around the Citadel of Former Flame.</p>
<p>There lived a roaming group of ghasts and ghouls on this plane, numbering in the hundreds, that were referred to as the Flesh Renders . Due to going great lengths of time without any sustenance, they were particularly savage undead . Some speculated that they may have once been minions of Vecna.</p>
