<p>Northshield House was a quality inn found in the town of Triboar in the late 14 th and late 15 th centuries DR . It was a reserved and stately establishment that was run by the Phorndyl family for many years, before changing hands to the Meltimers.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It lay in the east of town, opposite the Apothecary .</p>
<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
<p>The inn had an atmosphere of formality and calm. It was a modest but respectable place.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>It was a clear and tidy place, with a common room on the ground floor and private rooms on the upper floor.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Northshield House offered quality rooms for rent, with services and conditions a match for even the best inns in Waterdeep , and it was just as pricy.</p>
<p>Circa 1485 DR , a staff of six ensured it was well-seen-to; they were well-paid and loyal. Three great mastiffs kept guard and slept within the common room.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of 1365 DR , Northshield House was run by Dlukasz Phorndyl .</p>
<p>The business stayed within the Phorndyl family for over a century, until around 1475Â DR , when it was purchased by Urgala Meltimer , a retired adventurer , after the loss of her wife Darribeth . It was still in her hands through the mid-1480s DR.</p>
<p>If adventurers rescued Darribeth around 1492 DR and accompanied her to Triboar, then Urgala would reward them lifelong free room and board at Northshield House.</p>
