<p>A horn of the exalted dead was a macabre enchanted musical instrument whose notes summoned dead warriors to battle.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The names of two to seven deceased individuals were inscribed onto the horn.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>As detailed by Kazerabet in her tome the Art of Necromancy , these items bound the spirits of dead warriors with their magic, summoning them to fight for the wielder when the horn was blown. A summoned warrior needed to be called before the horn was blown and could be summoned to fight on a weekly basis. The spirits were armed with swords and spears . They would remain for up to an hour unless forced back into the horn upon their destruction. A dispel evil or spirit release spell would also send them back into the horn. Enchanted weapons were needed to harm them and they were immune to cold , poison , sleep , paralyzation , hold , and charm spells .</p>
<p>A warrior using a horn of the exalted dead had their name inscribed on the horn after their first use of this nefarious instrument. Upon their death, their spirt would join the ranks of the horn's ghastly host.</p>
