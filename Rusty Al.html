<p>Rusty Al was a weathered salty dog, merchant, pawn broker, and tattooist who ran Rusty Al's Tattoo & Pawn in the Docks District of Neverwinter in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Rusty Al was an aged but large and muscular human man. Although he appeared to be rusty with age, his name was a reference to his red hair. His left eye was covered by an eye patch , his left wrist was replaced by a hook hand , and his chest was decorated with tattoos, proudly displayed whilst running the shop.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Rusty had a gruff and direct personality, especially when dealing with late-night customers at his shop.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Rusty Al's was an established business by the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . He and his shop survived the strife of that year: the plague of the Wailing Death that ravaged Neverwinter and the crumbling economy after the war between Luskan and Neverwinter. As the city recovered, Al's pawn business was suffering from the greatly weakened economy, so much of the business's coin came from tattooing. When a duo of adventuring sailors that included Nisar Zayid was seeking to depart for the Nelanther Isles in 1372 DR, Rusty Al offered a special deal on tattoo designs that might've been applied to both adventuring sailors. The designs included Rope & Anchor , Heart & Arrow , Eye & Tears, and Gnaked Gnome . Two people, one tattoo each, were going for a hundred gold total.</p>
