<p>The Gaping Maw , also known as the Brine Flats , was the 88 th level of the Abyss and the home of Demogorgon , Prince of Demons.</p>
<p>Reflecting the dual personality of its master, the Gaping Maw was a vast continent covered in a jungle and surrounded an equally vast ocean with brine flats. Rising from the sea were twin towers, topped with enormous fanged skulls that marked the fortress Abysm , a labyrinth of dark and cold underwater caves. Few could enter without succumbing to madness.</p>
