<p>Sekrr was a male beholder who laired in Vournoth's Mire .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sekrr looked much like most beholders with ten writhing eye stalks atop his orb-like body. He had bright blue eyes and rich, maroon-coloured hide, though a number of his teeth were missing from his bottom jaw.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Considering himself to be a creative and artistic example of his kind, Sekrr liked to 'craft' sculptures of the creatures he petrified with his eye rays.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By 1372 DR , Sekrr had made Vournoth's Mire his home along with a mind flayer called Quthnorak . Though they usually left each other to their own devices, on occasion they would work together on some project or to defend their joint lair.</p>
<p>During the Silence of Lolth in 1372 DR , when the nearby city of Maerimydra was destroyed by the forces of Kurgoth Hellspawn , a number of drow refugees made their way through Vournoth's Mire. Sekrr managed to catch the rear of their party and killed at least three of the drow with his eye rays before coming away with three charmed drow thralls.</p>
