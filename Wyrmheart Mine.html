<p>Wyrmheart Mine was a highly productive dwarven mine in the Kobold Mountains , renowned in Chult for its vast collection of diamonds and emeralds.</p>
<p>The clan leader, Kyer Wyrmheart , was an old and hateful dwarf. He guarded the mine entrance with several kinds of ballistae , and kept pet dimetrodons who would feast upon any would-be raiders. He was presumably killed when the mine was taken by the red dragon Tzindelor .</p>
