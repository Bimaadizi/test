<p>Fox Bottom was one of three major moots in Baldur's Gate , located on the border between Brampton and Eastway districts of the city.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Fox Bottom was located just two blocks south of the Manycoins House , along the curving Stormshore Street , on the portion of the street previously known as Hulkael Street , that became dramatically shortened by the 15 th century DR . Another street that crossed the moot was Long Lane .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Fox Bottom was in the area of Baldur's Gate that, by the late 14 th century DR, was the closest thing the city had to a slum. The crossing was outlined by old rundown buildings and rat -infested rooming-houses. The windows and ropes across were decorated with drying washed laundry, and the sidewalks were filled with beggars and maimed old sailors. Due to the moot being in a busy part of Baldur's Gate, it was frequented by well-armed patrols.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The crossing's name â€“ Fox Bottom, originated from what it was in the distant past. This part of the city was once a wooded hollow where many foxes raised their young in well-hidden dens.</p>
