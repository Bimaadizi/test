<p>Ghustil Stornugoss was a githyanki healer of Crèche Y'llek , on the planet of Toril during the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Stornugoss had geometrically pleasing facial markings and shortly-cut hair. She wore a wizard 's robe and a multilayered ocular lens over her left eye.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Stornugoss owned an aberration hunters' amulet , that protected her and gave her an advantage in dealing with psionics, intelligence, and mind-affecting magic.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>One of Stornugoss' most often seen patients was Varrl , who needed healing at least 47 times in a short period of time. Ghustil suggested Sa'varrsh Kethk do something on the githyanki who was a great strain on the Crèche's resources.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Stornugoss, along with other gith of what would become Crèche Y'llek, attacked and claimed the Rosymorn Monastery of Lathander in the Western Heartlands of West Faerûn sometime before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . Soon after, the function of Crèche was changed as the githyanki war against the mind flayers in Faerûn shifted in balance. The gith sought for the astral prism , the artifact that imprisoned Orpheus , the long-lost son of Gith . During that time, Ghustil Stornugoss occupied the Crèche's doctor's office, from whence she performed her experimentation and research into the new illithid threat of the Absolute .</p>
<p>She also ran the device called Zaith'isk , which was said to be able to cure gith of an illithid tadpole infection. Stornugoss was well aware of the fact that Zaith'isk did not heal but extracted the minds of the infected gith, ending their lives. When a gith became infected, she encouraged them to use the device. If, by some very unlikely circumstance, an infected individual survived the procedure, Stornugoss made an excuse, leaving them in the doctor's chambers, locking the door, meanwhile preparing a cadre of gith warriors to slay the survivors.</p>
