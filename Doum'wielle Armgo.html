<p>Doum'wielle Armgo was the daughter of Sinnafain , an elf in the Moonwood , and Tos'un Armgo , a renegade drow.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Doum'wielle had silvery skin. She was a battle mage.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Doum'wielle was somewhat fearful and doubtful of her decision to join the drow , but her sword, Khazid'hea , gave her confidence and courage. She loved rabbits.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1484 DR , Doum'wielle won the "contest" for her father's sword, Khazid'hea . Her brother Teirflin tried to stab her with Khazid'head while she slept; she was quicker and slew him instead. She fled and her parents followed her. When they were pursued by orcs , Tos'un slashed Sinnafain's legs and left her at the mercy of the orcs. He then joined with Doum'wielle and led her into the Underdark , where they wished to join Tos'un's house, House Barrison Del'Armgo . However, Matron Mother Quenthel Baenre assigned them to the recreated House Do'Urden They and Ravel Xorlarrin subsequently accompanied the orc warlord Hartusk across the Silver Marches to supervise his armies. She also posed as a representative to her mother (the leader of the Moonwood) and directed King Bromm into a situation that resulted in his death.</p>
<p>In 1485 DR , Doum'wielle had Khazid'hea knocked from her hands into the river. However, she could not resist its telepathic intrusions for long and returned to retrieve it. After her father's death, she decided to join Tiago Baenre in his hunt for Drizzt Do'Urden in order to gain revenge.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Doum'wielle wielded the sentient sword Khazid'hea , which had been wielded by her father before her, and Catti-brie before that. Her sword spoke to her in her father's voice and disliked it when she used magic rather than sword-fighting skills.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h3>Tos'un Armgo</h3>
<p>Doum'wielle's father, Tos'un Armgo , seemed to genuinely care for her. He called her "my little Doe" and tried to toughen her up when they returned to Menzoberranzan.</p>
