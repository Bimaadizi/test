<p>Ilisar's Alley was a small back alley that was located in the city of Waterdeep . It was sometimes miscalled as Illimar's Alley , and its old name was Grave Alley .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Ilisar's Alley was located in the northern section of Waterdeep's Southern Ward . The alley branched south from Telshambra's Street at the border with the Trades Ward , cut west through a neighborhood, then turned north to reconnect with Telshambra's Street.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>The Stone House , which was the guild headquarters for the Carpenters', Roofers', & Plaisterers' Guild , was located on the eastern side of Ilisar's Alley where it branched from Telshambra's Street.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to the establishment of gates to the City of the Dead by the wizard Anacaster to facilitate travel there, the poorest of Waterdeep's citizens used this alley as a graveyard, hence the original name of Grave Alley. To preserve space, coffins were buried vertically, with one corpse under each flagstone. The practice was eventually abandoned after it led to undead bursting from beneath the street.</p>
<p>The alley was renamed for a Waterdhavian tailor named Ilisar , who became inexplicably wealthy and purchased the whole block. After he died of blacktongue fever , it was rumored that he had hidden or buried his wealth somewhere in one of the buildings on the alley.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>As of the mid-to-late century DR , there were rumors that ghouls , skeletons , wights , and zombies left over from the alley's days as a graveyard would still occasionally emerge to haunt the area.</p>
