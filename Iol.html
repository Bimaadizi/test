<p>This semi-precious stone was predominately blue in hue, but its color changed with viewing angle, from dark blue to straw-yellow. Small iols could be transparent but larger stones tended to have inclusions that could cause a star-like effect or, in the case of trapped hematite crystals, a flash of golden color much like sunstones . Iols were usually facet-cut to best display the stone's color change. A typical iol had a base value of 50 gp.</p>
