<p>In 1364 DR at the Spring Faire in Silverymoon , Wyn noticed that old songs passed on through the ages had inexplicably changed, yet not even the singers seemed to notice. He reported his findings to Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun in Waterdeep , who sent him to travel with Danilo Thann and the dwarf Morgalla to determine the cause.
