<p>Clan Orothiar was a clan of hill dwarves that experienced great misfortune during their years spent mining the Realms of Faer√ªn .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The dwarves of Clan Orothiar were experienced albeit unlucky miners, skilled smiths, and talented stonemasons.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>Throughout their history, the Orothiar dwarves were known to have two ancestral homes: one in Bloodstone Lands , and another on the Sword Coast .</p>
<p>Some of their kin had settled into the lands of the North .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Orothiar dwarves of Bloodstone had an amiable but estranged relationship with the villagers of the Bloodstone Barony .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At one point, Clan Orothiar made their residence beneath the Galena Mountains within the Bloodstone Mines .
Unfortunately they delved too deep and awoke a terribly evil power. Many of the dwarves were slain; those who survived either fled the region or found modest lives as shepherds in the western peaks of the mountain range.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Blue Dragon, 1243 DR , Orothiar dwarves had found a home within a system of mines deep beneath the Cloak Wood forest. Yet again, the miners went too far beneath the surface of Toril . They broke into an underground river that flooded the mines and killed nearly all of their kin.</p>
<p>Following the Bloodstone Wars in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Clan Orothiar attained a seat on the newly-formed Council of Bloodstone .</p>
<p>The clan was still active as of the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , at least in the region of the North.</p>
