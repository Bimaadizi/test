<p>The Order of the Jade Blade was an organization based in Loudwater and the personal agents of High Lord Kalahar Twohands in the 1370s DR . It was likely named after the famous jade -green bastard sword wielded by Kalahar.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Order of the Jade Blade had been only recently formed by the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<p>In that year, Kalahar's five-year-old son, Velvred , was kidnapped and taken into one of the Rensha tombs beneath the High Lord's Hall . Kalahar himself was warned by divinations that if he were to enter the tombs he would surely be killed. Therefore, he requested an adventuring party go into the tombs in his stead to either reconnoiter the area or rescue Velvred. If they rescued Velvred from the wererat bandit lord known as the Hark and returned, then Kalahar would induct them all into the Order of the Jade Blade. Similarly, adventurers who saved Nardine Twohands were also inducted. These heroes would have Kalahar's trust thereafter.</p>
<p>On Eleint 23 , 1372 DR, Jade Blade members were among the Loudwater forces mustered by Stedd Rein for an assault on the Dungeon of the Hark to root out the Hark and his bandits.</p>
<p>Members of the Order of the Jade Blade may have been recruited to help in various matters in and around Loudwater over 1372 and 1373 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Members of the Order of the Jade Blade served the needs of High Lord Kalahar Twohands in whatever problems the town faced. They could request an audience with him if needed, albeit at the lord's convenience, and ask to speak with other authority figures in town. They could also ask superiors or allies for special favors or magical assistance with matters they investigated, such as scrying and teleportation . Their authority aided them in investigating and gathering information in town.</p>
<p>Members could also be called upon by Loudwater militia leaders like Gauntlet Harazos Thelbrimm to assist in matters such as investigating murders. Other important people in Loudwater could request members to aid them in important tasks, such as when Prior Athosar sought help finding a cure to the slimy doom disease.</p>
<p>In general, they had an obligation to aid and protect the town and its citizens. Demanding payment for such services would ruin a member's reputation in town and lose them Kalahar's trust.</p>
