<p>The Shrine of Corellon Larethian was a small building in the forests of Shadowdale that was somewhat difficult to find. Although it had been abandoned long before 1369 DR , it still served as a sanctuary to travelers in the area who could rest there safely. It had a curse placed on it that would cause an unknown effect to anyone who desecrated the sanctity of the structure.</p>
