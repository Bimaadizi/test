<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Darya Scattertrail was initiated into the druidic circle of the High Forest. Several years later, she and her adventuring companions found themselves opposing a rogue Red Wizards of Thay who sought to tap into the dark powers of the Hellgate Keep . Despite the wizard's powerful sorcery, Darya's group used their knowledge of the terrain to trap the mage against an impassible ridge. The adventurers ended the Red Wizard's guards with ease, but the mage was not easy prey. He unleashed deadly spells that immobilized the gnome's troupe and summoned demons that devoured all the adventurers apart from Darya Scattertrail. Terrified, the druid used her boots' magics to flee, leaving her companions to their fate. Eventually, her panic subsided, leaving nothing but shame in Darya's heart. The woman threw all of her adventuring gear to the ground and forever left the High Forest. Sometime later, she was seen living in peace in a small village a day's ride from Silverymoon , repairing pottery for a fee of twenty coppers .</p>
<p>Darya's Scattertrail boots found their way into the hands of Dayne Lynneth , a merchant from Tyr's Eye plaza in the Blacklake District of Neverwinter in 1374 DR.</p>
