<p>The kanjo-bugyo were the financial officers of the shogun of Wa 's administration. They dealt primarily with legal matters pertaining to finances that the administrators of the daimyo could not handle themselves.</p>
<p>There were four officials in this office, and they were all honored positions, like all other officers in the shogun's government. The shogun had to approve an appointment to the kanjo-bungyo himself.</p>
