<p>The Undercellar was a clump of chambers in a network of storage cellars beneath the city of Baldur's Gate that housed a sleazy tavern and festhall. There were at least twenty-four ways in and out of this popular establishment, half of which connected to other buildings, one of which was through the Blushing Mermaid tavern.</p>
