<p>Iwna Thesk was an unfortunate priestess of Selûne from Glister who was accused of heresy.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Iwna and her sisters Fela and Iwna tended to the shrine at the then-trade moot of Glister until 1180 DR , when they were accused of participating in the New Moon Heresy . The three sisters did not survive the accusations, and it was only in 1194 DR that a formal inquest into the matter was performed by the House of the Moon in Thentia . The House of the Moon came to the conclusion that the charges were false and that only Selûne could judge them, formally absolving them of any misdeeds.</p>
<p>The accounts of this tragedy eventually found their way to Moonshadow Hall , and were discovered in 1373 DR by High Moonmistress Dhauna Myritar as part of her investigations.</p>
