<p>Ysval was a nighthaunt from the Plane of Shadow in the late 14 th century DR . .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As a nighthaunt, Ysval somewhat resembled a gargoyle with bat wings, talons, curling horns, and a whipping serpentine tail. His body looked as if made of the shadow-stuff of the night itself. He had no face, just a flat triangular space set with a pair of pale eyes, blank and round as pearls .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Unlike many other undead creatures, Ysval could bear the touch of sunlight without actual harm, though it made him feel uncomfortable. He had the mystical strength to darken the day to a point where it seemed almost as dark as during the night. When conversing with his underlings, Ysval used a psychic bond for communication without words.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
