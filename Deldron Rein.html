<p>Deldron Rein was a wealthy merchant of the Rein family of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>

<p>He also engaged in a number of lumbering ventures in the Delimbiyr Vale, though some, particularly local elves , raised concerns about them.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Deldron had a number of children, including his daughter Jesym , the traitor, and his son Stedd , the youngest.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When his son Stedd returned from the College of War in Athkatla in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , while he was still en route to Loudwater, Deldron departed the city to greet his son and conduct business in Daggerford , taking the Red Boar Trading Coster's sizeable guard with him. But a magical communication from Loudwater alerted Deldron about a vicious lycanthrope attack, known as the Night of the Blood Moon , and the Reins and their Red Boars hastened to return. Deldron sent Stedd ahead with half his forces while he followed close behind. When Deldron arrived in the aftermath, he heard many praising his son for his heroism and leadership, and was pleased. It also improved the Rein name, erasing the earlier memory of Jesym's treachery.</p>
