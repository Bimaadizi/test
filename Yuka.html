<p>Yuka was a follower of the Faith of the Nine Travelers in Wa in the 1700s on the Wa Calendar .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was a young man and zealous, but considered more-or-less harmless.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He wore religious vestments of his faith.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR) , Yuka set up a stall at the base of the Three Thousand Steps before the Shining Temple of Bishamon in Aru and attempted to convert the pilgrims away from Bishamon to the Faith of the Nine Travelers. Calling them "benighted heathens" with a "false belief" didn't help his case. The pilgrims were understandably aggravated by this and some two dozen formed a mob to chase him off, possibly even beating him. How this was resolved would prove to be a sensitive matter in the time shortly before the Ceremony of the Three Thousand Steps.</p>
