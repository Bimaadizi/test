<p>Tegal's Mark was the most widely known tassel, located near Rauthauvyr's Road , which served as the de facto capital of Tasseldale .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>While Tegal's Mark was not particularly large, it was quite a vision. The picturesque town was set between two wooded hills, surrounded by a garden. There were three major landmarks that were visible from the Tasselway road entering the town. These were two large houses on the south-eastern hill and an elven watchtower .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The town of Tegal's Mark was founded around 1187 DR by the renowned swordsmith named Tegal . His forge, also named "Tegal's Mark" was the landmark around which the town grew. His apprentices took on the tradition of stamping their blades with his personal "mark", a tradition that continued well into the 14 th century.</p>
