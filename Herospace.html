<table border='1'><tr><th>Type</th><td>Crystal sphere</td></tr></table><br>
<p>Herospace was an unusual crystal sphere with nine planets and nine suns. It was controlled by a group of twenty mages called the Rational Order of Magistrates, who only permitted exceptional individuals to settle on the planets they tended.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Herospace had flow currents connecting it to Realmspace , Greyspace , Faeriespace , and Darkspace .</p>
<h2>Solar System</h2>
<p>Herospace was unique in that it had nine small suns, each with only a single planet orbiting it. Each sun was a different color. Because of how the Rational Order of Magistrates operated, each planet was also associated with a different alignment. Only one planet had a moon, Borden, which orbited the planet Ge'Neva.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Herospace's planets were inhabited by those who were accepted by the Rational Order of Magistrates; the Order itself was composed of ten men and ten women, but employed large numbers of people as military and custodial staff to protect the sphere that was, after a fashion, their investment.</p>
