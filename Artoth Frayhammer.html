The entrance to the tombs was indicated by a sign, engraved in languages of dwarves, humans, and elves, that read "Last Repose of the Stout Folk of Myth Drannor". These tombs were protected by dwarven statues and the spirits of its inhabitants that were ready to destroy anyone who tried to claim the enchanted arms laid within the tombs, without paying the levy first.</p>
