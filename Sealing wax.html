<p>Sealing wax was a type of wax used to make seals and insignia. As this adhesive wax was used to seal both letters and legal contracts, it was often carried by diplomats and forgers.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This type of wax naturally grew on palms native to the islands of the Djinni's Claws in Zakhara .</p>
<p>Beeswax was often used as sealing wax, and was sold in Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue . The wax could be colored for an additional cost. The same catalog sold proper sealing wax for scribes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 14 th century DR , Hardbuckler gnomes produced a unique type of green seam-sealing wax. It was exported and sold in rolls of cloth. This type sold for 1 sp per tube. Later, an improved model was created, which functioned as long as oil was worked into it once per year. The green wax tube would turn purple if one tried to enchant it.</p>
<h2>Properties</h2>
<p>This sticky substance was sometimes scented. Scented sealing wax could be exchanged for tokens won at the Jack Mooney & Sons Circus of Ravens Bluff .</p>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<p>This substance could be stamped by signet rings worn by both nobles and knights. Sealing wax could be found in forgery kits and diplomat's kits .</p>
<p>In order to use a tube of sealing wax, one first had to unroll the bottom end of the protective cloth and squeeze the upper part. The wax could then be driven out of the tube and applied to a material.</p>
<h2>Production</h2>
<p>Sealing wax was mostly produced in settlements, as thus was in very poor supply in the wilderness. This type of wax was sometimes made into sticks or tubes for ease of use.</p>
