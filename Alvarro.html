<h2>History</h2>
<h3>The Pirate War</h3>
<p>In the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR , the Golden Legion was on a campaign against the pirate Akbet-Khrul . Prior to the final battle, Alvarro and a young officer named Halloran were sent by Captain Broker , the commander of the Legion's cavalry, to meet with Cordell. Broker had been badly wounded and Cordell decided to promoted Halloran to become the new captain of the cavalry with Alvarro as his second-in-command. This angered Alvarro, since he thought that he himself should have been commander. Cordell considered Alvarro a better horseman than Halloran, but he lacked the leadership skills to keep the cavalry disciplined.</p>
<p>Alvarro led two companies of cavalry in the battle that was a great victory for the Legion.</p>
<h3>Maztica</h3>
<p>Following the Legion's success against the pirates, Amn's Council of Six sent the Legion on an expedition westwards across the Trackless Sea . Cordell knew that Alvarro was still jealous of Halloran and considered leaving him behind in Amn, but ultimately decided to keep him because of Alvarro's skills as a fighter.</p>
<h3>Payit</h3>
<p>The Legion landed in the land of the Payit in Maztica near Ulatos . When the Legion's Helmite cleric Bishou Domincus 's daughter Martine went missing along with Halloran, he wanted to send Alvarro to go looking for them, but Cordell decided against it, believing that it wasn't an emergency and they would be back soon.</p>
<p>Some skirmishes occurred between the Legion and the native Payit near where they landed, Martine was ritually sacrificed by the Payit, and some Legionnaires saw Halloran snatched away by a magical ring. Thousands of Payit warriors then took positions around the Legion where it had landed on the shores and Alvarro wanted to use his cavalry to charge them, but Cordell decided against it, knowing that the Payit held the high ground. Bishou Domincus confronted Cordell and said that Helm had revealed to him that Alvarro should be the new commander of the cavalry. Cordell reluctantly then agreed to make Alvarro as the new commander of the Legion's cavalry.</p>
<p>Halloran, however, returned to the Legion. Cordell, under pressure from Domincus who blamed Halloran for his daughter's death, charged Halloran with desertion and had him confined to the brig of one of their ships. Domincus, however, was not satisfied with this and he privately met Alvarro in order to get him to murder Halloran in the ship's brig while the Legion was on shore battling the Payit. Alvarro agreed to do this for payment from Domincus.</p>
<p>Alvarro then went to Halloran's cell to muder him. Cordell, however, had deliberately made it easy for Halloran to escape and Halloran was easily able to get himself free from his shackles. Alvarro, not knowing this, attempted to attack Halloran, whom he thought was chained, but Halloran struck him and knocked him unconscious. Halloran looted Alvarro's knife and gold, and then escaped from the ship.</p>
<p>Alvarro returned to shore and took leadership of the cavalry in the battle against the Payit. He rode on Halloran's horse Storm . His cavalry and their wardogs caught the Payit by surprise, as they had never seen horses before. The charge turned the tide of the battle and the Payit routed. However, Alvarro was overcome with bloodlust and he led his men into the throngs of Payit civilians who had come out to watch the battle. While he was slaughtering unarmed natives, he saw a beautiful Maztican maiden named Erixitl staring at him. This woman had earlier helped Halloran when he was lost from the Legion. Alvarro attempted to run her down but was foiled by Halloran, who had arrived near the end of the battle. Halloran used a magic missile spell against Alvarro and then fought him. Alvarro taunted Halloran by calling him a traitor for fighting against him to defend the Payit woman. Alvarro was knocked to the ground in the fight, but Halloran decided not to kill him, thinking about the 'traitor' accusation. Halloran retook his horse and his wardog and also took Alvarro's sword. He then fled with Erixitl into the wilderness away from the battle.</p>
<p>Alvarro then took a black gelding from one his men as his new horse following the battle. The Legion occupied Ulatos following the defeat of the Payit and Alvarro led the cavalry in the Legion's triumphant march into the city. Cordell, wishing to make an example to instill obedience in the Payit, ordered Alvarro to find a few Payit warriors who showed some spirit and bring them to him. Alvarro chained four of them and brought to Cordell, who then had them publicly branded.</p>
<p>When Cordell heard of the riches of Nexal and decided to embark on a long campaign to the city, many of his men were against it, thinking it reckless, but Alvarro was enthusiastic about it.</p>
<h3>Kultaka</h3>
<p>The Legion had to cross through Kultaka in order to reach Nexal. The Kultakans fought with the Legion and Alvarro led the cavalry in the battle. He charged the Kultakans only to be led into a trap that caused them to be routed by a group of Jaguar Knights and it was only the mage Darien 's magic that prevented the Legion from losing the battle. Alvarro's failure in the battle left Cordell very disappointed in him.</p>
<h3>Palul</h3>
<p>After Kultaka, the Legion continued its march to Nexal and came to the village of Palul , near Nexal. The Nexalans had planned a welcome feast as a ruse for the Legion with the intention of killing them while they feasted. Alvarro, along with the rest of the Legion feasted and drank octal . The Nexalans used Erixitl as their translator and at first Alvarro didn't recognize her. The ruse was discovered by the Legion and Alvarro led his cavalry to fight the Nexalans. Alvarro's men slaughtered hundreds of native warriors and peasants in the town square. As he was riding down the Nexalans he then remembered that Erixitl was the woman that Halloran had fought him over near Ulatos and sought to find her amidst the fleeing villagers. He found her and grabbed her. He dismounted and pushed her onto the ground while a nearby legionnaire tended his horse. Halloran, who was looking for Erixitl, then found them. He killed the legionnaire and fought Alvarro. Alvarro grievously wounded Halloran, but Halloran successfully disarmed Alvarro in the melee and Alvarro then fled on his horse.</p>
<p>Alvarro then reported back to Cordell about the encounter, falsely claiming that there were a hundred Nexalans helping Halloran. Alvarro urged Cordell to search for Halloran, but Cordell refused.</p>
<h3>Nexal</h3>
<p>Nexal surrendered to the Legion following the battle and Alvarro, with the rest of the Legionnaires, enjoyed the luxuries of Nexal following their entrance to the city. Alvarro related to Domincus about what had happened at Palul with Halloran.</p>
<p>Kardann , the Legion's assessor found a secret doorway in the palace where the Legion was staying and he brought Alvarro along with Domincus to see it. The three of them opened the doorway and found a huge amount of treasure, which they later reported to Cordell who took it for the Legion.</p>
<p>Some days later, Erixitl was captured by the Legion in Nexal while attempting to rescue the Nexalan ruler from the hands of Cordell. Alvarro identified Erixitl as the woman that Halloran had protected before and Cordell realized that she could be used as bait to get Halloran to return. Darien, who was actually an agent of the Ancient Ones who had deceived Cordell and the Legion, insisted that Erixitl should die. The Ancient Ones needed her dead in order to fulfill a prophecy that would bring about their domination over Maztica. After Cordell insisted that she be kept as a prisoner to lure Halloran, Darien then met privately with Alvarro asking him to murder Erixitl in her cell. Alvarro felt suspicious about why Darien wanted to do this, but he nevertheless agreed to the proposal. Her deal with Alvarro was that she would give him a few hours alone with Erix so he could have his way with her if he would kill Erix when he was finished. Alvarro went to see Erixitl after Cordell interrogated her. While he was alone with her, Erixitl tricked him into drinking octal that she had spiked with a potion that Halloran had earlier stolen from Darien. Alvarro died immediately after drinking it and Erixitl escaped.</p>
