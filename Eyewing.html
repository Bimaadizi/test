<p>Eyewings were loathsome creatures inhabiting the Abyss on those planes where flying was possible.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Looking like their name, they were 5‑foot-wide (1.5‑meter) fur-covered eyeballs with 5‑foot-long (1.5‑meter) bat -like wings and 8‑foot-long (2.4‑meter) rat -like tails. Both wings and tail ended in talons, which was the primary way for eyewings to attack their foes. A vile blue fluid constantly leaked from their eyes, smelling of some acidic horror.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The blue fluid would scorch the sensitive tissue of other creatures' noses and mouths. They would fling it away from themselves, either towards the ground or against enemies. This fluid would harden after a few hours, becoming a rubbery lump.</p>
<p>Flying in the air, they were able to see with perfect accuracy for 25 miles (40 kilometers) and had infravision out to 120 feet (37 meters).</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>When not specifically commanded or engaged in combat, they would be listless, lounging around waiting to relieve their boredom by attacking and tearing apart innocent creatures.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>In combat, eyewings would either swoop down upon an opponent or hover and slash with their claws. They could also bombard enemies with gobbets of their eye-fluid as they had near-perfect control of where to fling it, and could hit enemies as far away as 100 feet (30 meters). Gobbets of eyewing tears would splash down amongst their enemies hitting anyone within 10 feet (3 meters) of where the gobbets landed. They and the foul gobbets were immune to cold.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Eyewings were not part of any natural order, needing neither to eat nor drink, instead simply absorbing magical energy. Not being the natural prey of any other creature, they usually only got killed in combat or by being a snack for the more powerful inhabitants of the Abyss. They usually lived in bands of up to twenty eyewings, often depending on the command of their dark masters.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bands of eyewings served the goddess Beshaba who in turn would act through them.</p>
