<p>Chir's ring was created and enchanted by the deep gnome wizard Chir Darkflame , active in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Chir's ring was nothing but a small bent wire that held a small sliver of amethyst in place, only vaguely resembling an actual ring.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The item's unimpressive appearance hid a useful enchantment that slightly increased the wearer's intelligence and allowed them to memorize once additional lower-complexity spell per day. Chir's enchantments made sure that the ring could only be used by wizards, those who despised law , and gnomes only.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Chir Darkflame proudly claimed that her ring was the first thing she's enchanted and refused to part with the piece of makeshift jewelry willingly. The ring was enchanted sometime before her capture by the illithid slavers of the black market in the mountains of Samarach in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR .</p>
