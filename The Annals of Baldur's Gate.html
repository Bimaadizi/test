<p>The Annals of Baldur's Gate was a history book dedicated to the city of Baldur's Gate , published before 1492 DR .</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>This book was mass-printed and served as entertainment rather than scholarly work. The history of the Gate was penned with a certain bardic flair and filled with colorful exaggerations. The tome's preface talked about the period of time after the settlement's Loklee days , when it became commonly referred to as the village of Grey Harbour . The city's later namesake Balduran left the city poor but eventually sailed back, bearing riches. The book's author claimed that Balduran's gold financed the settlement's first harbor, invested in its businesses, and erected a wall. As per the book's preface, Balduran became more famous than the village he was from, and with time it was renamed Baldur's Gate, leaving the city's previous names buried in maps and tomes of antiquity.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
