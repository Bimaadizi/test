<p>Su-to was a samurai ghost actor on Tsuta Island off the coast of the Fochu Peninsula in Wa .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1148 DR , Su-to was the greatest noh actor and dramatist of Wa. Thanks to his popularity, he asked the shogun to build a theater for himself on Tsuta Island of the coast of the Fochu Peninsula. The shogun granted this to Su-to and he gathered the best actors of Wa.</p>
<p>However, a massive undersea earthquake caused the island to sink, killing Su-to and the entire company.</p>
<p>Around 1248 DR , however, some of Su-to's admirers in the Celestial Bureaucracy caused the island to resurface with the theater intact, and Su-to and his company of players got to live again as ghosts . From then on, Su-to performed monthly for the gods.</p>
