<p>The Horrid Mire was one of the three swamps that composed the dark fey enclave , a region of the Feywild that was corrupted by a coven of fomorian witches and their dark fey minions.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Horrid Mire was located throughout the eastern area of the dark fey enclave, opposite of the Putrid Fen .</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>The mire earned its name from the clouds of toxic swamp gas that permeated the air above its murky waters. The foul clouds and the dark pools of water were the direct result of the alchemical experimentation of the fomorian coven of witches.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , a number of Iliyanbruen elves of New Sharandar became trapped in the Horrid Mire, during the conflict that arose between their people and the army of Malabog .</p>
<p>Kehl Skywatcher worked with some adventurers from Neverwinter to rescue her fellow elves. She concocted a unique potion that could actually reverse the putrid clouds permeating the swamp, as well as undo with the effects they had on the trapped elves.</p>
