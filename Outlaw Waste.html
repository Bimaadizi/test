<p>The Swagdar , or the Outlaw Waste , was a large stretch of land located just northwest of Dambrath .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This rolling grassland was filled with hidden valleys. The Swagdar covered a 150 square mile (390 km 2 ) area.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>This land comprised the only remaining free place for the Arkaiun . Small bands gathered together here to raid the countryside of Dambrath and the hated crinti . Sometimes they even ventured to nearby Halruaa . Arkaiun raiders were slain if caught, so battles with these people were fierce. If the bandits were able to capture children, they would raise them within their culture.</p>
<p>As of 1367 DR , there were several thousand bandits living within the Swagdar, but a single strong leader was yet to arise to unite them.</p>
