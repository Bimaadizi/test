<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Axe Rock was located on the north side of the Evermoor Way about two days' travel southwest of Everlund .</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>A spring emerged from high up in the formidable rock formation, but ancient dwarven stonework guided the drinkable water down smoothly carved troughs and channels to a pond beside the road. The spring was still providing water as of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
