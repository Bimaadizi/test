<p>A singing sword was either a +1 greatsword , or a +3 bastard sword , made of silver , that sang constantly, and loudly, when drawn. They were specifically crafted for members of the Harpers .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The song of the singing sword increased the morale of its wielder, increasing their capabilities in combat and protecting them from mind-altering effects. The more powerfully- enchanted version of the weapon granted completely immunity from these effects, and caused the spell emotion to only incite rage within the wielder. The song could also induce a suggestion like effect in certain nearby creatures within earshot, cause shriekers to remain perfectly still and counteracted the songs of harpies .</p>
<p>Despite the powers of the sword's song, they could be negated by a counter-harmony sung by a bard .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The goddess Eilistraee gifted twenty holy singing bastard swords to Qilue Veladorn and the drow Protectors of the Song of the Promenade of the Dark Maiden .</p>
