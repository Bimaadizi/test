<p>Dragonisle (sometimes The Dragonisle ) was the largest island in the Pirate Isles . It is populated by around 4,000 pirates and was geographically dominated by the Earthspur , an 8,000-foot-high (2,438 meters) mountain at the southern end of the island. The island had historically been the seat of power for anyone controlling the islands as a whole.</p>
