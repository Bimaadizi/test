<p>Nerester's Run was a short street in Suzail that began on Silverscales Street 's western end and ran northeast in a straight line and abruptly ending at the end of the same block.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nerester's Run was connected to the Tholone Lane at its northern and by a smaller wagoncut through a cluster of building into the arching lane, located on Nerester's Run's southern end.</p>
<p>Most buildings on Nerester's Run's eastern side were stout three-story structures of stone and wood, all in need of repair and maintenance by the 14 th century DR . Many of the buildings operated businesses out of their ground floors and cellars. The top two floors of the buildings were used as apartments â€“ on a smaller side. Many of these ramshackle apartments were rented out by "retired old salts," small-scale smugglers, spies, dockworkers, and messengers. All the buildings on Nerester's Run were owned by middle-class merchants and merchant families of Suzail. The merchants rarely visited these properties and instead sent around rent-collectors every month, always accompanied by bodyguards.</p>
