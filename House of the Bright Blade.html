<p>The House of the Bright Blade , run by Zespara Alather , was perhaps the most famous shop in Mirabar among humans . It was widely renowned as the best shop to get a sword that seemed as if it were custom-forged for its wielder.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The front room of the shop was lined with polished, paneled wood and a continual light spell was cast upon the cieling to illuminate the room. It glittered with the steel of hundreds of swords and daggers of all sizes, finishes, and prices.</p>
<p>A unique spell cast upon the room by a wizard friend of hers allowed Zespara to telekines to her hand any weapon that she had a hand in creating. This allowed her to impress customers as well as defend herself.</p>
<p>In the hallway between the shop and its smithing area there was a trapdoor on the floor that allowed entrance to an ancient temple.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The House of the Bright Blade was built atop an ancient temple of Auril . In the mid-14 th century DR , followers of the Frostmaiden kept appearing inside the underground temple, both to worship her and to attack its walls with picks in search of something. It is unknown what they were searching for, but they were frequently driven out by the apprentices of Zespara and the dwarven artisans of the First Below.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The front room of the store was guarded by ten female warriors , six of them outfitted in full plate and four of them unarmored. All were former thieves undercover and armed with a wand of paralyzation . They generally stood outside the store, lying in wait for any thieving patron that might try to dash out the door.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The store was chiefly run by Zespara and her bearded she-dwarf companion Calauthra Morgyr . The smithy also employed two female humans and four female dwarves.</p>
