<p>Symeera of Neverwinter was a human mage who owned a rooming house in Menzoberranzan during the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was always cheerful, as well as fair and careful in her dealings.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Her rooming house—simply called Symeera's —was of good quality but otherwise unremarkable. She catered mostly to non- drow visitors to the city, and had many mercantile connections that allowed her to discreetly acquire just about anything for adventurers from the surface, including magic items , potions , weapons , and other equipment.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Symeera had formerly been an adventurer and a mid-ranking member of the Order of the Many-Starred Cloak in Neverwinter . Circa the Year of the Morningstar, 1350 DR , she arrived in Menzoberranzan accidentally as a result of a faulty teleport spell, which delivered her into the Dark Dominion on the city's outskirts. Rather than seek to escape, she chose to settle down. By the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , her rooming house in Eastmyr had become known as one of the best places for surface visitors—especially adventurers—to stay.</p>
