<p>Lion's Crossing was a town located at least a day's travel away from the city of Ravens Bluff in the Dragon Reach region and just south of Fort De Villars .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR , a quartet of bards traveled to the town of Lion's Crossing for a festival. Bards Frenchy , Absolute , Scar , and Morton came across a strange sight: a collection of young heroes from the far-away land of the Malatran Plateau , speaking through magic in a strange way, dressed in curious adventuring garb, and including some uncanny creatures such as saru , tam'hi , and katanga . The meeting proceeded with no incidents, and after a bit of trading, both groups continued on, the bards to Lion's Crossing and the Malatran heroes to find an obsidian artifact.</p>
