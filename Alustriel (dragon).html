<p>Alustriel , more commonly known by her nickname, Triel , was a female faerie dragon that imprisoned the wizard -murderer Maddgoth in his own castle in Undermountain and made it her home in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , alongside her mate, Otto .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Triel seemed to be about 13 feet (4 meters) tall to any shrunken individuals within Maddgoth's Castle, but was, normally, around 1 foot and 1 inch (33 centimeters). Besides her growth to this size, Triel appeared much as she did at birth. She was a very silvery faerie dragon, so much so that her scales had a vaguely reflective quality about them, and had thin, translucent wings of an aquamarine coloration that matched the icy blue of her eyes. Once she made her home in Maddgoth's Castle, she took to wearing a signet ring around her back right leg, matching with Otto as though it were a marital one.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Triel, though she had her bouts of overreaction, was generally of a cheery disposition. Any emotion she felt, she felt strongly, so it was difficult for her expressions to remain stoic when they so easily displayed her feelings. This characteristic passion extended to her whole body language, as she was known to flutter without restraint when happy or, when anxious, to rapidly hit her tail against things. She also had a slapstick sense of humor, but if ever her jokes led to genuine discomfort, Triel was just as quick to share an earnest apology.</p>
<p>The faerie dragon, however, had a sharp change in personality during her stay in Undermountain. While she grew accustomed to motherhood, Triel took on a much more draconic temperament, becoming quick to anger and very defensive, particularly around her clutch of babes.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Triel had all the natural abilities that came to faerie dragons, including a paralyzing gas breath , and, given that she towered over any foes within the size-shifting field around Maddgoth's Castle, these were only amplified. She had also learnt sufficient wizardly capabilities to be able to cast a few spells , such as color spray , Tasha's uncontrollable hideous laughter , and slow .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The signet ring that Triel wore was one of six, originally made by Chollas the Variant, that allowed her to activate the two-way gate between Maddgoth's Castle and the cellar of Chollas' home in Waterdeep. Given the magic she practiced, she also made sure to avoid destroying a variety of magical tomes and scrolls that she kept close to her nest, as well as claiming ownership over some of the possessions left behind by her close friend, Sandoth , a collection that included a cursed hat of stupidity .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Triel often ventured into Maddgoth's kitchen to forage for dried vegetables or spices. She found the place disgusting, magically burning some of the serial killer's leftovers and renouncing his filthy utensils, but the preserved foodstuffs she took to cook herself. Though she eventually planned to find fresher food up above in Waterdeep once she had taken sufficient vengeance on Maddgoth, they also served to supplement the food that her husband provided using magic. As an extension of these motherly duties, and to help lift her spirits, she enjoyed discussing the nuances of comedy with her children as well as telling them jokes.</p>
<p>When she was not occupied with her hatchlings, however, she also found the time to gleefully torment the trapped wizard, even, at one point, going as far as to fill his prison with water.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Triel may never have known her true, biological family, but the bond she subsequently formed with Sandoth was like that between a father and a daughter. She was ready to depart Silverymoon , where she had lived with him her entire life, to stay by his side, and was wracked by such anger at his death that she swore to take cruel vengeance upon his murderer: Maddgoth.</p>
<p>For this man, and his homunculi , she had little sympathy, reveling in tormenting him or hunting down his companions whenever she got the chance. She insisted that, since he had taken so much from her and hers, it was only fair she return the favor in kind.</p>
<p>The only responsibility she held above that was the one she had to her mate, Otto, and their two hatchling faerie dragon children. Though she could be overprotective, anything she perceived as a threat to their safety earned her enmity and was met by her ruthless claws.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>At Home in Silverymoon</h3>
<p>Triel was born circa 1318 DR in the north of the High Forest . Her mother and her siblings, still in their eggs, were being used to nourish a young black dragon , leaving only Triel to be hatched successfully after a party of adventurers , known as the Moonsilver Corps , slew it. The survivors of the fight found her right as she hatched, leading to Triel mistaking one, the apprentice wizard Sandoth the Laugher, as her father. He and his sole remaining companion, Gulland Stonefist , took the strangely colored faerie dragon back with them to Silverymoon where they would raise her. Given her silver scales, her new caretaker, who so adored the silver-haired Alustriel Silverhand , named the hatchling after her, though he never addressed her by her full name and instead preferred the shorter "Triel".</p>
<p>During the intervening years, Triel and Sandoth greatly enjoyed each other's company. She grew to truly take on the role of his daughter rather than, as most people assumed, his familiar, with the two risking their lives for each other multiple times during their adventures. At some point, she also met and fell in love with Otto, much to her mage friend's chagrin, until sometime around 1365 DR , when she played a mutual prank on the pair that alleviated their jealousy. The three years that followed were some of the happiest in Triel's life, but this would not last long.</p>
<h3>Move to Waterdeep</h3>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Sandoth decided that he would move to the city of Waterdeep, and both of his faerie dragon allies agreed to come with him. Despite the other two's excitement, however, Triel could not help her trepidation. She was reluctant to leave Silverymoon and, by extension, her namesake, whom she secretly believed was the reason for all of their success. Even so, she found it in herself to look forward to living in a new city, where she could comfortably hatch her eggs under the protection of both her loved ones, and the three were off. Unfortunately, soon enough, her fears were proven right: Sandoth was murdered just two days after their arrival in Waterdeep.</p>
<p>The pair of faerie dragons had been out leading Waterdeep's City Watch on chases through the City of the Dead when, upon their return to their new home, they caught Maddgoth stealing materials from Sandoth's stores. Triel was so deeply enraged to see the serial killer's homunculi still maiming the corpse, bringing all of her previous anxieties to bear, that she felled the first of Maddgoth's creations, known as Brawn , then and there. She had injured the murderer all in the same motion, prompting him and his companions to run through their gate in the cellar back to Undermountain. However, Triel, managing to grab onto his cape right before he stepped through, was not so quickly satisfied, and Otto remained in close pursuit behind her.</p>
<h3>Life in Undermountain</h3>
<p>Though shaken by the sudden change in surroundings, Triel and her mate were quick to leap back into action, paralyzing Maddgoth with their breaths and holding off his homunculi simultaneously, until Otto was able to properly capture their friend's murderer. Although she wanted nothing more than to keep pursuing the homunculi, she knew her eggs were coming soon, and so relented to find herself a safe place to nest. Still, she and Otto found the time to commit one more cruel prank, placing a cursed hat of stupidity they retrieved from the rest of Sandoth's belongings atop Maddgoth's head. Not only was he trapped in a mage-proof prison of his own devising, but he was also rendered even more incapable and arrogant by the hat.</p>
<p>Triel was not content with Waterdeep and reminisced about the sunlight up above, but while she made her home in Maddgoth's Castle, she began to be satisfied with, at the very least, the modicum of protection it provided for her new nest. This nest she made, primarily, after venting her frustrations on the wizard's laboratory and recovering segments of parchment she could use. She destroyed large parts of his equipment and his tomes, most of all the spellbooks he had stolen from his many victims.</p>
<p>It was on Eleint 16 of the same year that her eggs finally hatched: one of standard red scales, while the other's matched her silver. At some point during her stay, she even began to sell off the various treasures Maddgoth had hoarded as a way to purchase Sandoth's property and keep the gate in its cellar hidden.</p>
<p>As of 1374 DR , Triel still made her lair in Maddgoth's Castle alongside Otto.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>After Sandoth's corpse was found, both Triel and Otto were being sought as possible witnesses to the crime, but, because of their disappearance, some Waterdhavians instead began to suspect that they were the ones guilty of his murder.</p>
