<p>Liam Thistledown was a human child, and the first human encountered by Drizzt Do'Urden .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Liam was the youngest child of the Thistledown family, and was somewhat mischievous. He had light brown hair and eyes, with several freckles.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the midâ€”14 th century DR , Liam ventured out of the farming household, slacking from his chores. Drizzt's panther , Guenhwyvar , started for the child, but the dark elf stopped her. Later, Drizzt approached the child, and explained his name, whilst pointing to himself. The child screamed in fear, "Help, it's a drizzit!", and ran back home to tell his family. Some of his folk, curious, ventured out with him. They too eventually met, and were scared off, by the drow renegade.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Thistledown household was raided by the barghest Ulgulu , who murdered every family member, including young Liam.</p>
