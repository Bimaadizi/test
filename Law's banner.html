<p>A law's banner was a magical standard that raised the morale of troops when seen by a mostly lawful army.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was a standard of blazing red.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Once raised, once a day, any soldier in the lawful army who was within a quarter mile (0.4 kilometers) of the banner and could see it would reap its benefits, with bolstered morale. If the standard fell for any reason, its magical effect would be lost almost immediately unless picked up by another soldier. Otherwise, they would suffer great dread, believing their cause to be lost.</p>
