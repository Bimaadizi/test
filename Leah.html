<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1357 DR , Alias of Westgate sought Dimswart 's aid with the mysterious azure magical glyph tattoo she'd woken up with one day. She arrived at the Dimswart Manor just a few days ahead of the lord's daughter's wedding. Leah was busy with preparations and was about to replace tapestries when Alias requested an audience with the Sage of Suzail. She complied. She also had never seen a saurial before and assumed Alias' companion Dragonbait was a familiar and Alias herself was a wizard .</p>
