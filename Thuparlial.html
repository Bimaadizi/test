<p>Thuparlial , also known as prehnite , was found in hardened lava as a lining to gas cavities in the rock, but rarely was this lining thick enough or an attractive color to warrant cutting it into gemstones.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Thuparlial was hard, resilient, and translucent gemstone which varied in color from deep green through pale greenish yellow and from yellow to brown. Thuparlial was cut in facets if light-colored but otherwise made into cabochons . It was considered an ornamental stone and a typical specimen had a base value of 10 gp.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Powdered, this mineral was used in inks for creating the pyrotechnics and heat metal spells. Red wizards who had access to large quantities of thuparlial experimented with using it as a substitute ingredient for many fire- and heat-based spells. It was unknown if they succeeded.</p>
