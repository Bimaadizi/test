<h2>Content</h2>
<p>The book recorded the events of the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , when hero Alias and her "brother," saurial paladin Dragonbait visited Westgate and became entangled in plots of the city's criminal underbelly. The duo reunited with their former companion hin " bard " Olive Ruskettle , Mintassan the Sage, and the book's author, Jamal the Thespian. Together, they ended the reign of the mysterious leader of the Night Masks, only known as the Faceless (in reality Victor Dhostar ).</p>
