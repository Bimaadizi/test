She wore +4 banded mail and a cloak of the bat . Finally, she had a potion of invisibility .</p>
<p>She had private quarters in Starhaven , the palace of Prince Andru in the High City of Bral . It was a spartan and spotlessly tidy place.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She was a completely loyal to Prince Andru and House Cozar , and was never far from his side.</p>
<p>Mahaxara saw right through Lord Diadan Cartan 's act as a witty fop and saw him for the vicious murderer he really was. In private, she hated the man and waited for the day she could confront him in a fair fight.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hailing from some faraway world, Mahaxara Khal traveled on a spelljammer privateer before she arrived on the Rock of Bral. Already an experienced warrior, she enlisted in the Royal Guard and within eight years had risen to its command.</p>
