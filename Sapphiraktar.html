<p>Sapphiraktar was an ancient male blue dracolich and a member of the Twisted Rune .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Out of vanity, the dracolich maintained his dragon appearance through magic.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Preparing to kill Jymahna for spying, Sapphiraktar taught dragon magic to Rhangaun .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Sapphiraktar made his cavern home in the ruined city of Teshyll west of Alatorin in Calimshan . His vast network of caves ranged south from Memnon for 50 miles (80,000 meters), east to the undercity of Keltar , and west to within 10 miles (16,000 meters) of Teshburl .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1072 DR , Sapphiraktar became a dracolich. In 1374 DR , Priamon "Frostrune" Rakesk was fooled by Khelben "The Blackstaff" Arunsun , his former mentor but now hated adversary, into seeking what he thought to be an ancient Shoon artifact. With this artifact, he planned to take over control of the Twisted Rune. Blackstaff then struck a deal with Sapphiraktar, the Rune preferring to have the Blackstaff deal with the traitorous Runemaster rather than having to deal with him themselves.</p>
