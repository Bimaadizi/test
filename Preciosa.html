<p>Saer Preciosa was a patron of the Elfsong Tavern from the city of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Preciosa was a half-elven woman of the wood elven ancestry with a light woody or bronze skin tone and muddly blue eyes. She wore her blonde hair braided and lightly dyed in lavender.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Saer Preciosa was a frequent customer of the Elfsong Tavern in the Eastway neighborhood of Baldur's Gate. She attended the "Laff Riot" show at the Elfong, a stand-up comedy performance hosted by Harvard Willoughby in Elfsong's side room with a stage. Preciosa, a well-dressed woman herself, thought Willoughby to be a snappy dresser apart from the man's monocle . She hoped the word around town about the comedian was true and he was funny enough to distract her from the looming threat of the Cult of the Absolute .</p>
