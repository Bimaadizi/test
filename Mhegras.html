<p>Mhegras of Esmeltaran was a Zhentarim priest of Bane in the mid-14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was quite bitter about owing allegiance to the Zhentarim . He was not all that brave himself.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He bickered much with Sabran during their assignment to the capture of Shandril Shessair , and believed it would be necessary to slay him at some point. Drauthtar Inskirl and Eirhaun Sooundaeril both saw him as a rival worth slaying. Hlael Toraunt and Korthauvar Hammantle counted him as all temper and bluster.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He had a spell he counted as a "brainbore-worm", which burrowed into eyes and gnawed at brains. He believed it to be adequate for revenge on his would-be murderer, strongly implying it was painful.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Some of the cargo he concealed included horse barding.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sabran joined the caravan from Scornubel to Waterdeep in which Shandril Shessair sought passage on late 1357 DR . He presented himself as a weaver instead of a priest, and concealed some horse armor as contraband, despite the fact he was undercover. He remained undercover through the ambush at Haelhollow , not taking part in the battle, taking note only of the fact that Aumlar Chathoun had been slain.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the fight, they tried to capture Shandril while she was out of spellfire and knocked out, guarded only by Narm Tamaraith , but decided against it when she woke up too soon. However, they were then ambushed by the Harpers Beldimarr and Arauntar , who were posing as caravan guards, and got their necks broken. This left them unseen to the Zhentarim scriers Hlael Toraunt and Korthauvar Hammantle . for much of a day. Unknown to the Harpers, he survived thanks to a contingent spell.</p>
<p>He was slain during the caravan's next ambush; he attempted to capture Shandril but she reduced him to ashes using her spellfire .</p>
