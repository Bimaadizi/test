<p>The Abbey of Chauntea was an abbey dedicated to the Great Mother on the Sword Coast North during the 10 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This abbey was located close to Mount Waterdeep and north of Nimoar's Hold .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The abbey was a complex of buildings constructed of stone, each sporting stained glass windows that depicted Chauntea. Surrounding these buildings were glass greenhouses.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The abbots of this complex gathered flora that would have otherwise been lost during the Orcfastings War , such as Chauntea's Token , and planted them in their fields so they could be carefully preserved. These plants were utterly unique and were in danger of extinction.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>This abbey was operated by a group who called themselves the Sisters of Chauntea . These included the Sisters Earthtender and Warm Hearth .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Cold Claws, 940 DR , Warlord Gharl and his men set fire to the fields in an effort to stop the coming advance of trolls . Smoke went on to shade the sky and it was not long before the fields around the abbey were ablaze, the raging flames devouring all crops in their wake. The Sisters rushed to harvest a sample of each plant in the fields around their abbey, even if it meant sacrificing their lives. Sister Warm Hearth was most concerned about the field of Chauntea's Token being burned, it being most precious of all the plants and guarded by a dryad that attacked anyone who approached it in its immature state.</p>
<p>During this time, a group of time-displaced adventurers from the 15 th century DR came to the abbey and did what they could to aid the struggling Sisters.</p>
