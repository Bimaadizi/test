<p>A ring of truth was an enchanted ring capable of detecting any lie.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This magic item was both a blessing and a curse to whoever wore it. It allowed them to know whenever anyone was lying to them, no matter how small. However, it also prevented them from lying or telling a harmless fib. The voice of anyone lying to the wearer of this ring would rise to a falsetto when they lied. A ring of truth could not penetrate magical lies created either by spells , potions , etc. Instead, the wearer would not be able to hear the voice of anyone attempting to lie via magical means, which in effect gave away their lie.</p>
