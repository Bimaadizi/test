<p>The Jovial Juggler was an inn located on the northern side of the town of Beregost . While it could be considered quite the average establishment, it was quite popular among the Beregostan youth.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Located on the west side of Beregost's main road, the inn was easily recognizable. It featured a grand roofboard depicting a juggling jester that could hardly be missed.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Juggler was the inn of choice for those who wanted to drink, dance and spend their evening in revelry. Minstrels and other performers were featured nearly nightly, and well-paid for their performances. Revelers were treated to meals of whole roasted pigs , boars , and oxen .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Officer Jessa Vai of the Baldurian Flaming Fist set up shop within the Jovial Juggler to help deal with the bandit problem that plagued the Sword Coast . She offered bounties for bandit scalps for some time, before she was asked to report back to her superiors in the city.</p>
<p>That same year, the paladin Bjornin stayed in the inn to recover from the wounds he had received from a band of half-ogres west of town.</p>
