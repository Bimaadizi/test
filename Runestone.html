<p>Runestones were stone slabs with messages carved into them. These messages could be warnings, instructions, stories, or accounts of events. They varied in shape and size, depending on the creator and time they were made. Some runestones even had magic enchantments placed on them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The ancient civilization known as the Adamant Kingdom of Xothaer was home to numerous dwarven scholars. They recorded vast amounts of information on runestones. These records could still be found underneath the Cloud Peaks in various conditions, most shattered, in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<p>Around 1370 DR , the dwarves of Iltkazar were famous makers of runestones.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Runestones were large slabs of durable stone, usually about an inch thick. They had stories, instructions, and accounts of events carved into one or both of their faces. Runestones were sometimes carved with images or runes in relief, and thus could be used as seals or temporary path markers when pressed into wet mud. Although extremely rare, there were also runestones made of precious metals.</p>
<h2>Variations</h2>
<h3>Dwarven Runestones</h3>
<p>Dwarven runestones were written in the Dethek script. They usually came in diamond or circular shapes. The text started at the edge and spiraled into the center, where an illustration (such as a clan symbol) was usually carved. Due to this, they were read from the outside edge to the center.</p>
<p>Dwarven runestones were also used to mark graves, where an illustration of the dwarf in question would be carved into the center of the stone. Most dwarven runestones were used as maps and clues to hidden hordes of treasure. These stones were some of the most sought-after by greedy adventurers .</p>
