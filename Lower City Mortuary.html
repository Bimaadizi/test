<p>The Lower City Mortuary was an aptly named mortician's business that serviced the Lower City Graveyard of the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Lower City Mortuary was perched against the city's walls, on the edge of the Lower City Graveyard, somewhere west of Candulhallow's Tombstones and north of the Elfsong Tavern . The building itself was of a common architectural design for the area. It was a stone structure of two floors built atop a basement where embalming was performed. The mortuary's front entrance was marked by a single sign but was easily noticeable by the numerous coffins stored out front.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Valmorba 's mortuary offered coffins, funerals, ceremonies, and embalming to the residents of Baldur's Gate.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Lower City Graveyard, where the Lower City Mortuary was located, predated the mortuary by at least a century. The Lower City Mortuary was established in the Year of the Nether Mountain Scrolls, 1486 DR and was run by Valmorba, an aged cleric of Kelemvor . By the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , with the strife of serial murders committed by the Cult of Bhaal and the looming war with the Cult of the Absolute , the Lower City Mortuary was overwhelmed. The old woman struggled with procuring and having coffins built in time. One of the children buried by Valmorba was Ayana , daughter of Fiona . The mother thanked the mortician for going above and beyond for the dead child and burying her teddy bear along with Ayana. Valmorba was known to waive fees when possible for the poor, especially parents burying their children.</p>
<p>In the same year of tumult, the Lower City Graveyard may had been accidentally desecrated, and the bodies of those buried there were raised as zombies by Nina Dortmell , a talented child with a gift , who was trying to resurrect her recently deceased brother.</p>
