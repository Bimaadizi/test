<p>The Order of the Silver Chalice was a knightly order dedicated to Siamorphe the Noble.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>This group was primarily made up of Tethyrian noble warriors dedicated to locating lost members of noble families and restoring to power those who would govern justly with the interests of the common people at heart. Besides aristocrats and fighters , the Order was also home to some templars . Membership within the Order was considered among Tethyrian nobility to be a mark of prestige.</p>
<p>The Order only accepted new members during the leap year day Shieldmeet , though they would make exceptions under special circumstances. Such was the case for a number of nobles during the Reclamation Wars .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As of the late 14th century DR , the Order of the Silver Chalice defended the eastern borders of the kingdom from monsters and were its most prestigious order. By the late 15 th century DR, they were still prospering and had grown to become Tethyr's most popular knighthood.</p>
<p>As one of Tethyr's recognized knightly orders, they were bound by an oath of allegiance to fight in the Queen's armies in times of war or great need, serving as elite units.</p>
<p>For a couple of years after the Reclamation Wars, while none of the crown's children were of appropriate age to hold the office of Crown Ecclesiastic within the Tethyrian court, the Knights of the Silver Chalice as a whole filled the vacant role. Acting at the request of the Queen, the Silver Scions worked as official liaisons between the kingdom's monarch and the heads of its religious institutions. Once one of the royal children had come of age, the Knights of the Silver Chalice transitioned into being the Crown Ecclesiastic's honor guard.</p>
<p>Additionally, the leaders of the Order of the Silver Chalice held sole right to the position of Title Chancellor within the Tethyrian court. This chancellory was in charge of recording and overseeing the proper promotion of Tethyrian nobility to titles heredity and otherwise, as well as claims. To this end the Title Chancellor was to maintain permanent records of Tethyr's noble families, both present and past. In order to maintain this database the Title Chancellor was to corroborate information with the Heralds of Darromar , Riatavin , and Saradush .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Order of the Silver Chalice's initial base of operations was Morninggold Keep and the wider county of Morninggold , but later sold it to Zaranda Star in 1362Â DR . Five years later they would receive ownership of the towering keep back, as well as a new base in County Morninggold's southern reaches, Mount Noblesse . This fortified manor would serve as their chapter house, where their primary work and training was conducted. Among their secondary holdings were Iltarghal Keep , the fortress of senior member Rikos Dughol .</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, outside of Tethyr and Waterdeep, the Order had members operating from their homes in the cities of Everlund , Secomber , and Silverymoon .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By some accounts the Order had formed in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , in the city Waterdeep during the Time of Troubles . In that tumultuous time nine young nobles banded together to defend the city's Sea Ward from the undead minions of Myrkul . Under the leadership of Marquise Scion Aalangama Gulderhorn , a minor Siamorphan priest , the nobles managed to halt the invaders outside of Moonstar Villa . However, this was no more than an informal precursor. The true official founding of the knighthood was marked as being a year later, in the month of Alturiak , in the country of Tethyr.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the Time of Troubles, Lady Gulderhorn had received a vision, an edict, from the goddess Siamorphe herself. It pushed her to gather together a number of Waterdhavian nobles and nobles of Tethyrian birth, who had either escaped the Ten Black Days of Eleint and the ensuing madness themselves or were the children of nobles who had. Together they traveled to Tethyr, set on fulfilling Siamorphe's edict of restoring the kingdom from its state of anarchy and finding a proper heir to its throne. Over the next ten years they would fight bravely in the midst of the Tethyrian Interregnum to restore just rule to the country, debating all the while on who was the rightful heir.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , the knights helped drive bandits out from their occupation of the temple Chevangard and restored its rightful ownership to the Church of Helm .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Helm, 1362 DR , the Order ran usurper "barons", an adventuring company called the Four , out of a noble's manor they had been squatting in for over five years, leaving the adventurers to flee into the ruins of Shoonach .</p>
<p>That same year Zaranda Star, a former adventuress and commander in the Tuigan War , used the spoils of that war to purchase County Morninggold and its keep from the Order of the Silver Chalice, who needed operating money to continue their efforts in restoring nobility in Tethyr. From then on, they fought in support of Zaranda in the Reclamation Wars. During that conflict they would lose three of their original founders in the First Siege of Myratma , the only survivors of the old order being Ellem Sunspear I , Rikos Dughol, and Lady Gulderhon. The Order would later go on to lose several more of its over seventy knights during the conflict.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , on Mirtul 3 , Zaranda Star was proclaimed queen of Tethyr by the citizens of Zazesspur , ushering in the Rhindaun Dynasty . On the day of her coronation, Zarandar and her spouse Haedrak were bestowed honorary Silver Chalice memberships and the titles of Defensors Royal of the Chalice. In gratitude to the Order of the Silver Chalice for their valiant efforts, Queen-Monarch Zaranda recognized them as a knightly order. and restored Lady Gulderhorn's rights and titles to County Morninggold.</p>
<p>By 1370 DR , Lady Gulderhorn was still vying to increase the Order's memberships to numbers comparable to those of Tethyr's older knightly orders, the Champions Vigilant and the Loyal Order of Innocents . The bulk of the young nobility they were inducting and training at that time were from the Iltkazar Highlands , due simply to proximity. These recruits were markedly impetuous, eager to fight on the nation's behalf at Ithal Pass or the Amnian border, no matter how many lectures they received about the costs of war.</p>
