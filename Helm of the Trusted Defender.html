<h2>History</h2>
<p>The helm of the Trusted Defender was created circa the Year of the Brazen Vizier, 881 DR in a little-known halfling and gnome town of Shepherd's Valley . The community's watch captain wore the helmet with it being handed from the captain in charge of the Night Watch to the captain helming the Day Watch. And at dusk, the helm was passed along to the Night Watchmen once again. This continued until Pheldon Tock , one of the Night Watch captains, traded the item to the Gibling Armstrong's Curious Shoppe . Eventually, the helm of the Trusted Defender was purchased from the store by a bored dwarf who used it as a mantlepiece at a land far away from Shepherd's Valley.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , the helm of the Trusted Defender found its way into the stock of Conlan's Smithy in Kuldahar in Icewind Dale and by the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , it ended up in the hands of Quinn Silverfinger , an aged cleric of Waukeen in Lonelywood .</p>
