<p>A grandfather plaque was a type of small, guardian gargoyle in the Realms, created for the purpose of acting as a door guardian.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>All grandfather plaques were immobile constructs , lacking any sort of limbs, being that they were designed to be attached to the stone lintel of a door. Their bodies consisted entirely of a bas relief of a human face, depicted with strong, dignified features. On average they measured around 1​ to ​2 feet (0.3​ to ​0.61 meters).</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>All grandfather plaques possessed an average level of intellect, comparable to that of a human, allowing them to converse with and screen guests. They were utterly devoted to their role as guardians, finding their existence to be meaningless if they were left without people to guard, and exhibited absolute loyalty towards anyone who lived within a building they guarded. Their focus was so narrow that they seldom interacted with other creatures unless a response was needed.</p>
<p>However, whenever a grandfather plaque's building fell into ruin and abandonment, it would engage in conversation with other intelligent creatures, imploring them to either repair the structure or remove them from their lintel and install them elsewhere on a door of a structure that was in active use. They would often, in return, offer all the treasures that had accumulated over the years from previous trespassers.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>These constructs possessed a limited form of telepathy , allowing them to mentally converse with a single person whom was designated at the time of their creation. They also had the power to wizard lock the doors they were attached to, allowing them to open and close them at will.</p>
<p>Grandfather plaques were imbued with three spell -like powers to defend themselves and their charges. Firstly, they could shoot magic missiles from their eyes. They could shout at intruders, as per the wizard spell. And anyone who touched either them or their door without permission would find themselves weakened, as if they were the victim of a ray of enfeeblement . Additionally, they could only be harmed by weapons that had a +1 or greater enchantment .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Grandfather plaques were solitary constructs, never being placed on doors in pairs. If ever a complex had more than one grandfather plaque as part of its security, they would always be found on separate on doors.</p>
