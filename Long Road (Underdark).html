<p>The Long Road was an astonishing thousands-of-miles-long tunnel running through the Underdark below the Sea of Fallen Stars and much of Faerûn , in use by dwarves of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Its course took it through the Underdark domains of the Deep Wastes , the Glimmersea , Darklands , and Great Bhaerynden .</p>
<p>It appeared to start at the dwarven village of Glen in the Dalelands , where an elevator accessed the "Deep Mine", a disguised tunnel to the Underdark. From there the Long Road ran south beneath the Inner Sea. On the way, it linked to several other dwarven communities, such as Dwarves' Deep , and went as far as the great dwarven realm of the Great Rift in south Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Long Road was traveled by dedicated dwarven Underdark merchants . In the 1360s DR, the Glen dwarves traded their produce and goods to fellow dwarves along the Long Road, and guarded and patrolled their section well. In return, they received mushrooms and even live dragon eggs, which they sold onto visiting dwarves on the surface. The humans of nearby Mistledale had only just suspected an Underdark connection by 1372 DR .</p>
<p>Elsewhere, however, the Long Road was plagued by frequent attacks from drow and other subterranean creatures.</p>
