<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Similar in some respects to the divine champion , glorious servitors gained no additional spells, but did gain several useful powers and spell-like abilities, including being able to transform into their deity's favored animal. They could even communicate while in this animal form. Only humans , tieflings , or aasimar who hailed from Mulhorand could be glorious servitors.</p>
<p>Glorious servitors could use the following spells or spell-like abilities: true seeing , greater command , mass cure serious wounds , mass inflict serious wounds . They were immune to poison, magical fear , and enjoyed resistance to spells. Their strength was enhanced by their god.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The majority of glorious servitors came from the ranks of paladins , clerics , fighters , and monks throughout Mulhorand. Of these, most were paladins and clerics because of their religious knowledge. Rangers and monks also occasionally followed this path, though it could take time for them to develop the required knowledge and diplomatic skills.</p>
<p>Rogues and assassins typically served Set , while arcane spellcasters often followed Thoth .</p>
<p>Generally glorious servitors were found in the larger cites in Mulhorand and were less common in Murgh√¥lm , Semphar or Unther . Servitors following Horus-Re or Anhur were sometimes encountered in the border outposts of Mulhorand . Glorious servitors also obtained high ranks within their churches.</p>
<h3>Unfaithful Servitors</h3>
<p>Like paladins , clerics , glorious servitors were bound to follow the orders and code of conduct laid down by their deity. Willful violation resulted in the servitor being stripped of their powers, often resulting in a demotion. They could regain their status by atoning for their sins, or by changing their allegiance to another deity in the Mulhorandi pantheon , which resulted in the eternal enmity of the previous church.</p>
