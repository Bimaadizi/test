<h2>History</h2>
<p>The cowl was once worn by a traveler of the Underdark who underestimated the dangers of the realm. Like many before them, they were overcome by the perils found outside the safety of their home. It was eventually found among the drow forces of Phy'xzar and House Argith , who invaded Tethyamar in search of the jewels of ardor .</p>
