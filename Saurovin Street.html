<p>Saurovin Street was one of the main thoroughfares in Daerlun , Sembia , circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . This street ran east-southeast from the southern tip of the Westmarket area until it ended at Barrel Lane near the southern gate out of the city, known as the Sea Arch. Among the residences and shops on Saurovin Street was Shadowdark House , an oddity that could roughly be called a magic shop.</p>
