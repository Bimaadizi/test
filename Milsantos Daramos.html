<p>Milsantos Daramos was the Tharchion of Thazalhar in Thay throughout the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Milsantos was born in the early–14 th century DR. In his later years, he was an old man with a lined face and shaggy white brows. He always wore his plate armor adorned with magical runes. A kite shield , helmet , and broadsword or lance , magically enchanted as well, completed his combat gear.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Milsantos was a true Thayan patriot, and wished to see him homeland united and at peace. Although a proficient killer, he did not enjoy fighting but rather saw it as the only means of protecting his people's interests. He was also a just ruler, at least by Thayan standards.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He was a seasoned warrior and had a reputation for being the canniest commander in Thay.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Milsantos established the Daramos family as one of the youngest noble houses of Thay during the mid–14 th century DR. As of 1357 DR , the family comprised himself, his wife, and their two young children. His only daughter was named Mantorra .</p>
<p>He opposed Szass Tam 's aspirations to rule over all of Thay, although he was wise enough not to do so openly for most of his career. In some ways he appreciated Tam's actions in so far as he believed that only hatred of Tam could possibly unite his fructuous homeland. Other Tharchions were liable to see him as growing soft in his later years.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As Tharchion of Thazalhar, it was his duty to ensure the safety of caravans passing through his territory to and from Mulhorand . Even as he neared his sixtieth year, he spent little time at his capital in Pyarados and personally led three small troops of cavalry—known to be the hardest-riding in all of Thay—against marauding monsters. He was known to personally collect fees and tolls from travelers—much of which was paid at the bridge over the River of Dawn —and he preferring to be paid in gems and other items of value that he could carry on his person. During this time, he was officially neutral in the growing tension between Szass Tam's supporters and enemies.</p>
<p>During the War of the Zulkirs , Daramos served as an important ally of the Council of Zulkirs until he died of old age in the Year of the Black Blazon, 1382 DR .</p>
