<p>Hollinth , the Eighth City of the Sword , was one of the cities in the imperial heartlands of Jhaamdath .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The city of Hollinth was far west of the capital Naarkolyth , closest to its twin of Tuoxent near the Deepwing Mountains .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hollinth was founded in the −5250 DR , as the eighth of the realm's core cities. It was paired with the construction of its twin city Tuoxent that same year.</p>
<p>The year −276 DR saw Jhamdaath embark on a campaign of conquest and expansion, logging the Chondalwood and warring on the elves of Nikerymath . The elves responded in the Year of Furious Waves, −255 DR , by casting a great High Magic ritual that caused a huge wave from the Inner Sea to crash all the way from the Bay of Jhaamdath up to the Deepwing Mountains. The cities were drowned in the new Vilhon Reach , and Hollinth sank and was lost, with psionic energy from its lost relics affecting the local environment.</p>
<p>The sunken cities of Jhaamdath were suddenly revealed by dropping sea levels following the Spellplague in 1385 DR , becoming the Vilhon Wilds . The situation was then returned to its previous state in 1486 DR by the Great Rain and Second Sundering that covered them in seawater once more.</p>
