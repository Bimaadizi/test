<p>The People of the Black Blood were Malar -worshiping lycanthropes from the many forests throughout Faerûn . They were more of a loose group of small tribes than a formal organization.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Each tribe among the People of the Black Blood acted much like a pack with the leader of the tribe being the strongest member of the group, known as a Bloodmaster . Many of the tribes had their own social hierarchy, based often on the leader's animal form. Thanks to their physical strength, werewolves and wereboars readily became Bloodmasters.</p>
<p>Having little contact with other tribes unless Malar required it of them, the various tribes claimed their own territories to watch over. On occasion, when a pack's Bloodmaster had lived beyond their usefulness, an agent of Malar was sent to challenge them and select a new one from among the tribe. In 1372 DR , this agent was Kyrran Graylord .</p>
<p>Some tribes included special Malar-blessed individuals known as Black Blood hunters , who embraced the truly brutal elements of Malar's worship. They had no unifying organization or mandate, with some tribes featuring them as leaders, others as mere hunters, and others lacked their presence altogether.</p>
<h2>Bases of Operation</h2>
<p>The group was most active in Faerûn's forests.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The ferocity of the People of the Black Blood was so great that it could inspire awe and reverence, especially among more savagely inclined barbarian tribes. This would sometimes lead to the establishment of fearsome Black Blood cults that venerated the lycanthropes and strove to emulate them. The most notable among these were the so-called Cults of the Moon .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was difficult to pinpoint the origins of the People of the Black Blood due to the disparate and independent nature of their organization. However, it was likely that the first tribe came together under direction of Malar, possibly to track down a specific quarry.</p>
<p>Following the Spellplague , Malar was much diminished, however the People of the Black Blood remained loyal to him. A sect of the People of the Black Blood isolated on the Island of Moray in the Moonshae Isles would subsequently split from the main faction, and went on to be known as the Black Blood Tribe .</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, the People of the Black Blood continued to operate in the eastern Glimmerwood and in Luruar . The smaller tribes continued to hunt for captives to sacrifice to their god, while others had become less savage and had welcomed many shifters into their ranks.</p>
