<p>The Two Pools Trail was a trail in the Western Heartlands of Faer√ªn , crossing the Trade Way at least twice.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Two Pools trail was accessible from the Trade Way north of Scornubel, and was so named because it crossed two pools, one of which was Dowan Pool . Traversing it on horseback was doable, while doing so on wagons was impractical.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thoadrin used the Two Pools trail to harry Orthil Voldovan 's caravan; after ambushing it, he meant to lead them through the trail to Dowan Pool, where he'd restock, and then ambush them two nights afterwards, down the road. Although Orthil himself expected that ambush, Thoadrin's men were able to make the trip, allowing them to execute the ambush as planned.</p>
