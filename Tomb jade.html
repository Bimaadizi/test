<p>Tomb Jade was the name for jade that had been buried for centuries and turned from green to red or brown.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tomb jade was rare and commanded a high price in the Realms. Normal jade was considered a fancy stone , but after being mined and possibly worked, then buried for great lengths of time, it changed color and was worth ten times as much. A typical specimen had a base value of 1,000 gp. Note that jade turned green if buried with items made of bronze which rendered it equivalent in value to normal jade.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Powdered tomb jade was an ingredient in potions of undead control . It could also be used as a talisman for turning undead , granting a priest a second chance to turn an undead creature after a failed attempt.</p>
