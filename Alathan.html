<p>Alathan was a well-known martyred priest of Lathander who was active long before the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Alathan was a High Priest of the Church of Lathander from the land of Tethyr in the Lands of Intrigue . The cleric rose to prominence when he was persecuted for preaching about the Morning Lord in Tethyr sometime around the late 10 th century DR . The local Tethyrian duke did not stand for the new and unwanted faith growing within his domain. He hated new things and wished his commoners not to get any bright ideas. By the mid 14 th century DR, Alathan was renowned enough to become an exclamation of shock and disgust by the laypeople and clerics of Lathander. The exclamation was "By the blood of Alathan!" or shortened to "Bitterblood!". Both clerics of the famed adventuring company – the Knights of Myth Drannor , Doust Sulwood and Semoor Wolftooth , were known to evoke the martyred High Priest's blood.</p>
