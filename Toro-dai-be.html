<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Within Toro-dai-be, there were 68 buildings, including traditional minka homes, godowns , a mill, and a temple dedicated to the Toro-dai school.</p>
<p>Toro-dai-be was known for its unique characteristics.

<p>As of Kozakuran Year 1430 (1356 DR) , the village was led by a powerful shukenja who served both as the community leader and the manager of the shoen.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Distinct from most villages, Toro-dai-be boasted a simple yet effective stockade for protection, complemented by a network of irrigation ditches and moats. While the village lacked samurai or bushi , it had a militia of 127 able-bodied men and boys. These individuals were armed with spears and naginatas and defended the village in times of crisis, such as during wars or frequent bandit raids.</p>
<p>Additionally, the village received external support in challenging times. During periods of conflict or at harvest, the provincial temple of the Toro-dai school dispatched twenty sohei to assist the villagers.
