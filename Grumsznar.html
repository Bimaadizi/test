<p>Grumsznar was a drow wizard of House Fey-Branche in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He was encountered by an adventuring party, after they had been sent by Ssar Tarell to find a way to enter House Do'Urden . Grumsznar told them he couldn't allow House Do'Urden to acquire the three parts of the legendary Spider Helm , the final piece being a gem . Thus, he planned to use the companions as a distraction.</p>
<p>He gave the companions the house entry password, and sent them to meet with Rizzen Do'Urden , who would provide them a map of House Do'Urden. Furthermore, he suggested that in order to gain full entry to House Do'Urden, they appear as part of a returning drow patrol. Therefore, with his illusion magic , he transformed each member of the party into a drow version of themselves.</p>
