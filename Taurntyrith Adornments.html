<p>Taurntyrith Adornments was a shop in the city of Waterdeep , in the 14 th century DR , that was owned and operated by the couple Phelorna and Teirist Taurntyrith .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This shop was located along Copper Street , in the North Ward of Waterdeep.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>This shop stood two stories tall.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Taurntyrith dealed in door panels and wall panels of both painted and iridescent acid -treated copper and enamel . These predominantly depicted blue-green or blue-and-silver forest scenes.</p>
<p>At some point, the propietor Phelorna began attaching to the backs of these panels shaped, tempered metal bells . These gave their panels the unique property of ringing a faint, " fey -like" chime whenever they were tapped gently with a coin , fingernail, or ring . Teirist would tell their customers that this chime would tell their customers that this transported their minds to "faraway and mysterious solitudes."</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During its time of operation, the forest scene panels of Taurntyrith was quite popular among the crowded city's denizens. However, their sales truly began to soar after the introduction of their chime bells and this upward trend continued for well over seven years.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In addition to Phelorna and Teirist, their son Tanar Taurntyrith worked in the shop in his youth and was quite talented at painting his family's panels. He was known to sing the ballad called The Horns of the Far Elf Realm whilst working.</p>
