<p>Darol was a young nobleman from Cormyr circa 1357 DR who was present at the wedding of Gaylyn Wyvernspur and Frefford Wyvernspur .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1357 DR, tipsy Minda was unwittingly instrumental in the assassination attempt on Giogioni Wyvernspur 's life during the wedding reception. She continuously asked and goaded Giogi to do his famous imitation of King Azoun Obarskyr IV . He did. It triggered the assassin's magical azure bonds, forcing Alias to attack the source of Azoun's voice.</p>
<p>One of the guests, Darol, received a slash to his face when he was trying to impress the young noblewoman by unsuccessfully stopping the assassin. This made Minda swoon over him, to Giogi's disappointment. Darol later was given permission to accompany Minda's carriage back to Suzail.</p>
