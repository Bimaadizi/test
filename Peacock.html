<p>Peacocks were a species of bird found in the Realms.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The shrieks of these birds sounded vaguely human -like.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Several decades prior to 1368 DR , an eccentric nobleman by the name of Lord Ceraut imported a small flock of peacocks to his estate in Furthinghome . As his estate fell into disrepair the peacocks made their way out into the countryside, until by 1368 DR they had grown to a large population that was breeding unrestrained. The peacocks continued to remain by 1372 DR and by that point had become so prominent that Furthinghome earned the alias "City of the Peacock."</p>
<p>In the mid–14 th century DR , Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue sold individual peacock feathers for one gold piece each.</p>
<p>In the late-15 th century DR, the Outer City of Baldur's Gate had a burgeoning peacock-breeding
industry. Around that time the Helm and Cloak served peacock meat.</p>
