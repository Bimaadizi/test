<p>Maranyuss was a night hag who was personally kicked out of the Nine Hells by Asmodeus himself.</p>
<p>She found herself in Waterdeep and set up a bookshop called Curious Pages that specialized in esoteric books. At some point, she met the deva Jinnaoth Ir'Gadohn and since they both hated Asmodeus, they entered into an uneasy alliance. Mara helped Jinn stop the ritual of the First Flensing , which would have allowed Asmodeus to enter Waterdeep.</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>Mara normally wore an illusion of beauty which made her appear as a dark-haired woman. In her natural form, she was a hideous purple hag.</p>
