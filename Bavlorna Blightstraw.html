<p>Bavlorna Blightstraw ( pronounced : / b ɑː v ˈ l ɔːr n ɑː / bav-LOR-nah ), also known as Slack-jawed Lorna , was one of the three hags of the Hourglass Coven , that took control of Prismeer , one of the Domains of Delight of the Feywild .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She had a grotesque, toad-like appearance, with bulbous eyes, cracked skin, and a mouth that often hung agape. Her jaw could open to eerily unnatural proportions, allowing her to swallow creatures whole. She spoke in deep, raspy voice that sounded like the croak of a toad.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Bavlorna lived the life of a hermit, perfectly content to stay within her cottage in Hither , safe from the outside world. She was easily agitated, paranoid of outsiders, and obsessive over the "treasures" she had accumulated within her home. Bavlorna cared little for memories of the past or possible future outcomes, only mustering enough energy to live from moment to moment.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, she would have uncontrollable sneezing fits whenever she saw someone run counterclockwise.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Of the members of her coven, Bavlorna was the hag of the present and current existence. She could provide boons to others that were plagued with ongoing, anxiety-inducing problems. She was entirely protected from the harmful effects of aging and could never die as a result of advanced age.</p>
<p>The toad-like hag was amphibious in nature and could breathe both air and water. She also had the power to create a weird variety of quicklings known as "lornlings ," that resembled miniature versions of herself.</p>
<p>She was afflicted with something of a strange curse: Bavlorna had an allergy to widdershins. If she saw another creature run in place anticlockwise, she was overcome by a fit of sneezing which affected her ability to cast spells for a short time. During this fit, she would also be unable to keep any creature recently swallowed within herself.</p>
<h3>Combat</h3>
<p>When she felt threatened, Bavlorna could turn foes away with a withering ray of necrotic energy . At times she even bit at her enemies and could swallow them whole in a single chomp. They would then slowly be digested by the acids within her stomach.</p>
<p>Bavlorna had limited access to arcane magic , but could freely detect magic at will. She could cast the spell polymorph and a few others twice per day, and the spell plane shift once per day.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Among her possessions were a book entitled the Big Book of Bad Blood , within which she detailed the many grievances she perceived were directed towards her, and two humanoid -shaped pincushions that resembled her sisters.</p>
<p>Bavlorna hoarded mundane and useless items. She had an entire cupboard full of odd mementos including unsent love letters, dried-and-pressed flowers, loose buttons, and a collection of bird feathers. The "treasure hoard" kept within her bedroom held similar junk items, including a stag's skull and a wooden mannequin (wearing a helm of telepathy ).</p>
<p>She did however possess a giant bronze statue depicting a frog that held within in a massive extradimensional space.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>She almost never left the decrepit cottage she called home, found in the bullywug village of Downfall in the center of the swamp called Hither. Within her hut was a mysterious pool that helped preserve her physical form, and prevented it from entering into a state of rictus.</p>
<p>On the few occasions she did leave home, Bavlorna traveled aboard giant, bobbing lily pad .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Bavlorna despised her two biological sisters, the elder Skabatha Nightshade and younger Endelyn Moongrave . She held an especially strong disdain for Skabatha and sought to recover the portrait of her that remained within her lair of Loomlurch .</p>
<p>She made many enemies among the inhabitants of Prismeer, including Morgort the bullywug knight and Talavar the faerie dragon servant of Titania the Summer Queen.</p>
<p>Bavlorna believed she had a friend in the darkling elder named Charm , but she was in fact a thief under the employ of Bavlorna's sister Endelyn.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the hags of the Hourglass Coven took control of Prismeer, Bavlorna transformed her third of the domain into the fetid swamp known as Hither.</p>
