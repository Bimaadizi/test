<p>The Grove of the Great Tree was a dryad grove in the King's Forest of Cormyr that was threatened by the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The center of the grove was the Great Tree, a sentient tree of immense power that protected the surrounding forest, also serving as the tree-home of the Great Dryad. The other dryads and their trees were scattered about, acting as a defensive force for the Great Tree. They were further aided by vine blight -like plantoid defenders.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the drow launched their invasion of Cormyr, their forces began burning and despoiling the King's Forest as they went. The Grove of the Great Tree came under threat, and so the dryads sent Ravanys Woodsoul to gather aid from Eveningstar . By the time help arrived, the Great Tree had been cursed by fell magics and seemed like a dead trunk. Despite its poor state, the Great Tree could draw upon reserves of energy in the soil to rejuvenate itself and the surrounding area, as well as slaying the invading drow, only requiring time to complete the ritual.</p>
<p>The attackers arrived under the cover of the Darkening and included drow soldiers, wizards and necromancers , priestesses of Lolth , giant spiders , undead minions, and fierce Cay'Vorym Battlemistress driders . Most notable of all was the summoned salamander Braznioch , who simply wished to burn the whole forest down. Despite the fierce attack, the Great Tree survived to complete its ritual, reviving the damaged woodlands and destroying the invading forces entirely. The victorious heroes were rewarded with, among other treasures, fey magic-infused moss and toadstools .</p>
