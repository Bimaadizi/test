<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the tribe suffered many losses as they attempted to live in the Hullack Forest , and accepted the leadership of the fire giant Oghalis . They turned to woodcutting and exploratory copper mining and began enslaving the local satyrs and centaurs , but they proved unsuitable for copper smelting. The tribe then began kidnapping humans from the nearby town of Thunderstone , forcing their satyrs to abduct Troyappa , Kenhart , Joelem , and Jonren . This finally drew the attention of Cormyrean adventurers, who raided the camp and freed the slaves.</p>
