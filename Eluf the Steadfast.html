<p>Eluf the Steadfast was a dwarven member of Hal Stoutheart 's Tethyamar expedition during the 1480s DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Eluf had a thick gray beard, braided into twin forks. He wore a suit of plate armor and carried a dwarven war axe .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Eluf served as a mining foreman in the expedition, organizing the dwarves as they hungrily delved for the jewels of ardor . Unfortunately, a force of House Argith drow also arrived for the same reason, and began attacking and enslaving the dwarves. In one instance a rescue party was sent after them, only for all except the scout Rielle Proudforge to be captured as well. Fortunately, some surfacers from Eveningstar arrived looking for work, and Eluf was able to hire them to rescue the captive dwarves. The hirelings took on the drow led by Uhlsirayn , Phyrsinil , and Phy'xzar , and rescued the slaves, though they seemed overly obsessed with continuing to mine the jewels of ardor.</p>
