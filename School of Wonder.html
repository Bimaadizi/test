<p>The School of Wonder was once a well-respected mages ' academy in Amn that, following a magical disaster, became the reason for outlawing magic in the 13 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The School of Wonder stood to the northwest of Hillfort Ishla , north of the Small Teeth mountain range.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The School of Wonder of Amn was established in the Year of Prideful Tales, 1219 DR by the wizards Myrdon and Salasker . In the Year of the Killing Wave, 1257 DR a famous spellbook – Bowgentle's Book was penned at the school by aging Bowgentle , who arrived to the school shortly before his death. At some point during the school's existence, the Folio of Brass was penned by members of the academy. It was one of the very few records that proved the existence of illusive elven safehold – Myth Dyraalis .</p>
<p>The School of Wonder came to an end in the Year of the Leaping Frog, 1266 DR , when power-mad students unleashed an army of tanar'ri that ravaged the Amnian countryside and almost completely eradicated all students and Masters of the school. A little known fact was that the disaster was the result of the Demonshields recovered from the Fields of the Dead by members of the school. During the artifacts' study, some unknown event occurred, possibly an attempt to destroy the items, and creatures imprisoned within were unleashed and in turn summoned an army of their fiendish kin. The fiends promised power to weak-willed students of the school, gaining willing allies in the destruction that left the school a ruin.</p>
<p>The rampage had long-lasting consequences as the King Dhanar Parhek banned the usage of magic, proclaiming it seditious, both divine and arcane. The Temple District of Athkatla, along with its temples, abbeys, and a mage school, were torched in the summer of the Year of the Groaning Cart, 1267 DR . His heavy-handed attempts to quell the uncontrolled violence and destruction that followed led to his assassination in 1276 DR , putting an end to the monarchy of Amn.</p>
<p>Wizards became greatly distrusted and feared after the events at the School of Wonder. Wizards such as Orgoth the Tainted had to build their towers in distant, unsettled lands, rather than in urban areas (Orgoth was coincidentally killed by fiends that he summoned). The old Mystic's Academy of Llorbauth , Erlkazar , had links to the School of Wonder, and greatly outlived its sibling school. The legacy of the School of Wonder remained a part of Amn well into the late 14 th century DR, as the infamous Cowled Wizards adapted the School of Wonder's graduate hooded robes as their uniform.</p>
