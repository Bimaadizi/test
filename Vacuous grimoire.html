<p>Vacuous grimoires were a type of cursed books , or sometimes scrolls .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Items cursed to become vacuous grimoires were indistinguishable from the mundane. When a vacuous grimoire was placed among other books, it instantly transformed to be indistinguishable from tomes surrounding it.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Any creature capable of reading was a target for vacuous grimoires . Once opened, it took a single glyph , or a single symbol read to trigger a book's vile magics. Two separate cursed effects took place. Firstly, the target could lose part of their mind, suffering an intelligence drain. Secondly, there was a strong chance for them to suffer a loss of sagacity. Both of these effects were permanent.</p>
<p>Once activated, a vacuous grimoire did not lose its powers nor disintegrate. Instead, it remained dangerous and active. The only way of destroying such tome was cleansing it with a remove curse spell and then burning it with normal or magical flames.</p>
<p>Vacuous grimoires emitted a faint aura of magic when observed via the detect magic spell .</p>
<h3>Creation</h3>
<p>A vacuous grimoire could be created by a capable crafter of wondrous items via application of the feeblemind spell.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , a vacuous grimoire scroll could be found in the Master's Library of Krak al-Niraan , the citadel of the Brotherhood of the True Flame in the Weeping Desert .</p>
<p>Circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , another cursed vacuous grimoire was disguised to be the second diary volume of Lord Ulguth Ilvastarr II of Waterdeep . Both tomes of the diary were hidden in the Ilvastarr family vault.</p>
