<p>Tasseldale , one of lands' trading dales , was among the wealthiest within the Dalelands , having always been heavily influenced by the nation of Sembia . The land was comprised of twelve towns, or tassels , that accommodated about half of their population and served as the center of their society.</p>
<p>They were one of the southern-most located dales, and conveyed a large amount of the regions traffic along the East Way and Rauthauvyr's Road , which together connected Cormyr to Hillsfar . Many other small roads criss-crossed around the Tasselway , the prominent trail that ran the length of the dale.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>The Tassadran were by and large, craftspeople and traders, contented with orderly lives and maintaining a cool-headed demeanor. The craftsmen of the dale included gold , silver, pewter and tinsmiths, book-binders, wood-workers. illustrators, toy-makers and scores more. The minority of their populace that were unhappy with the crafting lifestyle typically moved on to other dales or work as loggers in the Arch Wood forest.</p>
<p>Like the rest of the Dalesfolk they were fiercely independent, and while visitors might dismiss them as money-hungry, would-be Sembians, they maintained a quiet, unassuming pride. They quietly set out to do what they thought was right.</p>
<h3>Trade</h3>
<p>The general economic dynamic of the Dalelands was each dale would produce locally-cultivated food products or harvest natural resources like timber or iron and trade them for the finished goods needed for everyday life. The opposite was true in Tasseldale. While they housed enough craftspeople to suit the needs of their populace, with enough still to export and profit, they lacked the raw materials that were so abundant in the other dales.</p>
<p>Due to their high economic demand, Tasseldale was extremely dependent upon Sembia for success. It wasn't a one-way boon for the nation, as Tasseldale offered a quaint getaway for travel, far enough to escape the urban lifestyle of Selgaunt or Ordulin but still quite close. Despite the fears of annexation held by many Tassadran in the 14 th century, the dale was considered by Sembia to be much more profitable as a neighbor, than another district. This outlook proved temporary as time went on.</p>
<p>The dale was home to a number of branches of large Sembian trading costers including the Red Wyvern Company and the Sheathed Dagger Coster , but had their own smaller competitors like the Tasselway Coster of Glaun .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Tasseldale was ruled by the Grand Mairshar , whose broad powers included law enforcement, handling foreign relations and, with consult of the Tassel Elders , writing laws and executing military action. Grand Mairshars appointed their successor upon retirement, pending approval of the elders.</p>
<p>The Mairshar themselves served as the dale's constables, adjudicators and soldiers. From all the volunteers candidates, only a select few passed the months of assessment and years service as a cadet. In addition to their martial prowess, the Mairshar were selected for their even-tempered disposition and tempered judgement.</p>
<p>To supplement this elite force, Tasseldale maintained an extensive militia of Tassadran that, when assembled, would fall under the command of a Mairshar.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After Moondale was founded in 700 DR , the forests of region receded and more dalesfolk settled in the area that would become Tasseldale around 980 DR .</p>
<p>After Aencar Burlisk declared himself King of the Dales , Tasseldale willfully joined alongside Battledale and Shadowdale under his rule. He was beloved to the Tassadran and they saw his authority as rightfully earned.</p>
<p>Following the murder of some Tassadran hunters within the Arch Wood in 1368 , the rivalry between the loggers of Tasseldale and Archendale turned violent with the development of the game known as Woodsmen's War . This game was little more than outright violent fisticuffs between the hunters, soldiers and rowdy youth of the two dales.</p>
<p>Despite the mutually-beneficial relationship enjoyed by both Tasseldale and Sembia throughout the 1400's , the mercantile nation attempted to peacefully annex Tasseldale, just as it had done with Featherdale in 1418 DR . When this didn't work, they became more aggressive and invaded the dale with mercenaries from the Sembian city of Yhaunn in 1420 DR . Grand Mairshar Erich Inshiland resisted the assault, but were ultimately defeated by Sembian forces. Following the collapse of the Netherese empire in 1487 DR , the vassal-state of Sembia freed Tasseldale from their control as a gesture of good will to ensure mutually-beneficial trade relations with their neighboring realms.</p>
<h2>Geographical features</h2>
<p>Unlike the rest of the dales, Tasseldale was a vast, flat open space ideally suited for farmlands. It featured a nearly-daily morning mist that blanketed rolling grasslands with small hedgerows and thin, winding streams that all emptied into the River Ashaba .</p>
