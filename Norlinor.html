<h2>History</h2>
<p>In life Norlinor was the "Artisan of the Forge" of his stronghold's Great Forge, tasked with maintaining it. When the Battle of the Dead occurred he was one of the stronghold's many inhabitants that died fighting the hordes of drow controlled undead .</p>
<p>Some time following the destruction of Dorn's Deep, the spirit of Norlinor was raised from the dead as a ghost by the activities of a necromancer named Terikan . He was one of the only inhabitants of Dorn's Deep whose will managed to avoid subjugation by the necromancer upon being risen from death. When a group of adventurers traveled through the ruins of his stronghold in 1281 DR he tasked them with putting an end to Terikan, who had by then achieved lichdom .</p>
