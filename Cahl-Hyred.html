<p>Cahl-Hyred was the innkeeper of the Weeping Widow Inn in the town of Targos in the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cahl-Hyred was a portly, welcoming, and friendly man who harbored superstitious fear of undeath.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Despite his harmless appearance, Cahl-Hyred was armed with a shortsword and a dagger . He carried a horn coral gem . His three hounds could always be found warming their bones by the inn's blazing fire pit.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , Cahl-Hyred paid for one of the inn's rooms to be inscribed with a magic glyph that would bind the feeling widow's ghost to the single room in which she cried through the night by a broken window. Despite his heartbreaking for the undead woman, Cahl-Hyred knew not how to help her.</p>
<p>In 1312 DR, a guest named Koluhm Bonecutter was driven out of the inn by the weeping ghost. He fled the premises without paying a single coin for the stay but left a ghost-touched bottle with Cahl-Hyred. The innkeep was too superstitious to try drinking the potion and promptly got rid of the item once he was told the bottle kept a tiny fragment of the Ethereal plane .</p>
