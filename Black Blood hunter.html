<p>Black Blood hunters were the most vile and depraved lycanthropes among the ranks of the People of the Black Blood , and who had been granted terrible power by their patron god Malar in recognition of their cruelty.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Any lycanthrope within the People of the Black Blood could conceivably be blessed as a hunter, regardless of whether they were natural born or had been afflicted with the condition as long as they could control their transformations. It was only necessary that they be powerful combatants who indulged in sadistic behavior above and beyond the mundane, bestial evil that characterized most members of the People of the Black Blood.</p>
<p>Not all tribes of the People of the Black Blood counted these vile hunters among their ranks. While Black Blood hunters had the brute strength necessary to be leaders of their tribes, some only wished to use their terrible gifts for hunting, torture, and other evil acts.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Black Blood hunters experienced enhancements to nearly all aspects of their lycanthropic abilities: they were hardier, could transform faster, became more dangerous in hybrid form, and their bites spread a more virulent form of lycanthropy . Injuries inflicted by a Black Blood hunter were infused with such vileness that they could only be healed with spells such as consecrate or hallow .</p>
<p>They could also assume limited aspects of their animal forms even when in humanoid form, such as to call upon the strength, endurance, or grace of a beast. They furthermore gained an empathetic connection to wild beasts, allowing them to communicate with animals in a limited fashion through body language and vocalizations.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>While they did not specialize in the use of weapons or armor , Black Blood hunters did master the use of wild equipment and wilding clasps , magic items that normally were designed to be used by druids while in the form of an animal .</p>
