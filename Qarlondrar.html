<p>Qarlondrar ( pronounced : /ˈ k ɑːr l ɔː n d r ɑːr / KAR-lawn-drar ) was a realm of dwarves in east Faerûn . It was home to the Qarshield , Murrend , and Tulsark clans.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The underground realm lay beneath the Godswatch Mountains near eastern Semphar .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>The realm was made up of the Qarshield gold dwarves , Murrend gray dwarves , and Tulsark shield dwarves clans, who lived and worked together harmoniously. The Murrend dwarves had a particular disdain for the term " duergar " and did not identity themselves as such.</p>
<p>The folk of Qarlondrar enjoyed a famed and luxurious standard of living, thanks to trade, excellent metalworking products, and the ingenious labor-saving mechanical devices that they designed and built.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>Qarlondrar had good relations with the surface, and considered themselves to be wisely partaking and adopting the best aspects of surface culture. Magical items, wizards , and adventurers from the surface found use in Qarlondrar when necessary, including the efficient and swift repulsion of several illithid invasions and preparation for suspected hostilities by drow .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Large deposits of iron were mined by the efficient techniques of Qarlondrar, then worked into excellent weapons , armor , tools, and mechanical devices for home use and export abroad. The mining led to the creation of new underground spaces that were then structurally reinforced and planted with fungus farms that fed the community.</p>
