<p>Naneetha Shinalstar was a war-mage of Saelmur on the Lake of Steam in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Elminster considered her as a "cruel but clever temptress".</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Naneetha spent many years exploring the realm of Turmish in search of magic and wealth that she might use to advance the power of Saelmur to dominate the Lake of Steam. She shared some of what she learned with Elminster, and he figured that she returned time and again to Turmish simply because she had fallen in love with the place.</p>
<p>She published a biography in the Year of the Harp, 1355 DR , titled Memoirs of an Illithid-Human Crossbreed . Elminster assumed she wasn't really an illithid -human crossbreed but had just picked the title to shock the jaded yet sizeable Calishite readership, but he said he would find her and ask her some time.</p>
