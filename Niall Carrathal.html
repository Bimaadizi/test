<p>Nial Carrathal , born Niall Cymrych , was a High King of Callidyrr in the mid–10 th century DR . He was the first king of the Carrathal Dynasty , and although he held the title of High King of the Moonshae Isles , he only ruled over Callidyrr.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was the son of his predecessor, High King Tanner Cymrych , and he was succeeded by his first son, Erfle Carrathal .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Niall was born into the Cymrych Dynasty of High Kings, who traced their lineage to the legendary first High King, Cymrych Hugh . However, after the family lost the Crown of the High King with the death of Niall's great-great-grandfather, High King Dolan , and subsequently lost both control over Norland as well as possession of the Sword of Cymrych Hugh with the death of his father, High King Tanner, the family's legitimacy as well as its connection to its legendary ancestor had been badly weakened. Thus, when Niall assumed the throne in the Year of the Animated Armor, 944 DR , the rule of the true High Kings of the Moonshae Isles came to an end, and he became High King of Callidyrr only. Niall made the decision to change the family name to Carrathal at this time, a move which was imitated when several other noble families likewise changed their names to distance themselves from the surname "Cymrych".</p>
<p>Niall ruled for ten years before dying of illness in the Year of Perilous Halls, 954 DR .</p>
