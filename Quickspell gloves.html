<h2>Powers</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The gloves' original owner, mage Bucknard was known for the speed with which he could cast spells. He believed that the casting speed was the most important part of spellcasting because even if one flubbed a casting, they had enough time to run away from danger. In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , quickspell gloves were among the magic items sold by the Sorcerous Sundries shop in the city of Baldur's Gate .</p>
