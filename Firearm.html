<p>Firearms , otherwise known as smokepowder weapons , gunpowder weapons , gonnes , or gunnes (a corruption of Gond ), were an advanced and exotic form of ranged piercing weaponry that were great at piercing through most armors.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>Firearms all utilized the same basic method of operation, requiring a high degree of hand-eye coordination to use them effectively. They fired front-loaded projectiles known as bullets.</p>
<p>The bullets of firearms were, much like sling bullets , small ball-shaped projectiles typically made of bronze , iron , lead , or steel . Several magical types were known to exist, but they were quite rare.</p>
<p>Firearms required an explosive powder charge to propel their bullets, typically 1 oz (28 g). Depending upon the world, this was typically either smoke powder or gunpowder . Without these powders they were useless and the more common these powders were, the more prevalent firearms were. This uselessness could be circumvented by incorporating melee weapons in a firearm's design, such as axes , short swords , hammers, daggers , or maces .</p>
<p>When the projectiles of these weapons were shot out they created a loud noise and cloud of thick smoke. The noise produced was loud regardless of substance, though smokepowder tended to produce a lower pitch, sounding more like a loud thump instead of a sharp "crack".</p>
<p>Typically firearms could only be fired once before needing to be reloaded, unless they had multiple barrels. Loading could be a cumbersome process, requiring a fair amount of concentration.</p>
<h3>Malfunction</h3>
<p>Firearms had the potential to "misfire" every time they were shot, especially in worlds where the weapons were in their infancy. At its most severe this resulted in an explosion that could destroy the weapon and thus injure their operator. Otherwise, a firing mechanism might break or have something preventing it from firing.</p>
<p>Moisture or the wrong amount of the chosen powder could also prevent a firearm from firing, requiring it to be reloaded. The former was due to the fact that gunpowder and smokepowder were both rendered unusable after exposure to water.</p>
<h3>Defending Against</h3>
<p>Some of the best magical defenses against firearms included protection from normal missiles , shield , most wind-based spells , and anything that caused wetness.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Firearms were spread across the Known Spheres over time by mass migrations of tinker gnomes, by spacefaring humans , and by the Smiths' Coster. In many cases these spacefaring people were responsible for bringing firearms to worlds, such as the Smiths' Coster, a mercantile company that commonly traded with groundling nations.</p>
<p>During the Second Unhuman War , humanoid armies and scro -led spelljammer navies sometimes carried firearms, though these were usually used only by elite or command units. When they were defeated in the war and forced to scatter, so too did their weaponry become scattered throughout wildspace.</p>
<p>In the wake of that war, the Smiths' Coster redoubled their efforts in spreading the use of firearms, leading them to make contact with the Lantanna, Waterdhavians , and other areas of Toril.</p>
<h3>History on Toril</h3>
<p>On Toril, firearms had never been extensively (or even adequately) researched and developed prior to the 14 th century DR , save for a few eccentric wizards . None of the major nations or organizations on the planet invested the time or money into producing firearms on a large scale. Not even the ancient Netherese empire had the most basic of firearms, the arquebus.</p>
<p>In 1246 DR , the first recorded use of bombards by the island nation of Lantan occurred. These bombards utilized gunpowder, as the deity Gond had yet to render the substance inert out of concern for his worshipers' safety.</p>
<p>Everything changed during the Time of Troubles , when Gond in his mortal avatar form washed up on the shore of Lantan. In return for the people there sheltering him, in 1358 DR he revealed to the Lantanna how to make reasonably safe and accurate firearms that utilized smokepowder, such as the arquebus and its variations. From that year onwards, the Lantanna priests of Gond (mainly the specialty priests , known as Gondsmen ) would work to spread the use of firearms, shipping them to Western ports.</p>
<p>In the first three years that followed, arquebuses were introduced to the wider Realms. During these years they were viewed primarily as curios. Some tried to produce their own firearms, but they were inferior to those made by the Lantanna. The Realms also experienced a slow influx of arquebuses overtime from spelljamming sources.</p>
<p>From the third to fifth year of their existence, arquebuses and their variants became more common. Well-stocked weapon shops began to carry them, those who wielded them were no longer looked at strangely, and their price dropped significantly. From the fifth year onwards it was possible to find firearms in large stores.</p>
<p>Felogyr Sonshal slowly became a major reseller for Lantan, distributing their firearms across the Sword Coast . But he carefully controlled his stock, ensuring that merchant families and thieves' guilds could not amass large amounts.</p>
<p>By 1372 DR , firearms were available throughout Faerûn . Around that time many of Gond's clerics supported themselves financially by selling ammunition for smokepowder weapons. Many rulers at this time viewed the Church of Gond with ire for having introduced firearms to the continent, seeing the weapons as a threat to their authority.</p>
<p>Around this time, following the Lantanna pirate Gimlet Watersprecht 's creation of a portal between Lantan and the Pirate Isles , there was a frightening rise in the number of smokepower and smokepowder weapons among pirates in the Inner Sea . This posed a great concern to the kingdom of Cormyr's then-princess and regent, Alusair Obarskyr .</p>
<p>In the late-15 th century DR, following the Second Sundering returning it from the parallel-world of Abeir , the island nation of Lantan became more secretive. From the occasional glimpses that outsiders got of the Lantanna, they got the impression that their technology had become more advanced in the time since their absence. This in turn lead some to speculate about what developments the Lantanna may have made in regards to smokepowder weapons.</p>
