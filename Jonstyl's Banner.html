<p>Jonstyl's Banner was a rooming house in Tilverton in 1367 DR run by the ex-adventurer Jonstyl .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Banner was located in the Old Town of Tilverton on Gateguard Road , just down from Filani 's Tower of Wits and Work and the Temple of Gond Wondermaker . It was formerly the Windlord's Rest inn until Thungor Triblane moved to larger premises nearby.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Jonstyl catered specially for adventurers. She offered discrete lodgings and potions of healing to those that needed it, and provided mounts, disguises, and meals at a moment's notice at any hour.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Along with the regular guests, the former proprietor Thungor paid for two shy gnomes to live at the Banner. Their job was to meet guests who arrived at the Banner, expecting to find the Windlord's Rest, and guide them to the Windlord's new location a few streets over.</p>
