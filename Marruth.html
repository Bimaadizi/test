<p>Marruth , also called root pie by humans and dwarves or elvish marruth , was a type of trail food pastry favored by the Fair Folk .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Elvish marruth was prepared with spiced mashed vegetables. The vegetable mash varied by the region. Usual stuffings were cabbage , potatoes , carrots , onions . The vegetables were baked until soft, then mashed into a bowl and mixed with salt , pepper , thyme , dill , unless a better selection of herbs and spices was available. Well-mixed mash was wrapped in fatty and flaky pastry dough, then baked glazed with a light egg wash. Once thoroughly cooked, marruth was chilled and wrapped in thick and oily waterproof rallow plant leaves. The wrapping prolonged the food's life and hindered rotting, making it perfect for the road.</p>
<p>In some taverns, marruth was served warm as a snack-sized appetizer or even as a complete dish alongside a glass of cold elverquisst .</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , marruth was commonly consumed by travelers on the High Road of the Sword Coast North and in the city of Luskan .</p>
