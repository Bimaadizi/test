<p>Gateguard Road was a large city street in Tilverton .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gateguard Road went on a twisting, irregular course through the Old Town of Tilverton. The northern end came off of Knights' Ride near the Cormyr Stairs , and went south around the grounds of Tilver's Palace past the Tower of Wits and Work , Temple of Gond Wondermaker , and the Windlord's Rest (later Jonstyl's Banner ). It curved east along the southern edge of the city, passing by a side lane that held Undreir Facilitations and the newer location of the Windlord's Rest, before passing through the Upper City Gate and down a more gentle slope of the city's knoll that didn't require stairs. It finally terminated at an intersection with the Street of the Sorceress in southern Tilverton.</p>
