<p>The Sandvoyagers Track , also known as the Sandvoyagers Trail , was a trail of footprints that cut across the Raurin . The Sandvoyagers Guild both created those tracks in their passage and used them to orient themselves.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Its sharp turns were announced by guideposts from which hung silver bangles stamped with the symbol of the Sandvoyagers Guild .</p>
<h2>Path</h2>
<p>The trail began on the south at Northknife Pass amongst the Dustwall Mountains ; it continued northwest across the desert towards the Gates of Sule , then went north towards a guidepost pointing the way to Terbakar and Pazar before joining with the bed of the dry River Athis for some time, crossing through both the Oasis of Akhir and the Oasis of the White Palm . The track briefly split from the river past this point; it rejoined the dry riverbed closer to Medinat Muskawoon .</p>
