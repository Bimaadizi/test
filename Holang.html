<p>Lady Holang was a consort of Baron Mukow Jian and the true ruler of the town of Pim Tung in Tabot around Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Born to a wealthy family of T'u Lung , Holang was kidnapped when she was a child and sold as a slave in Motra before she was of marriageable age. For her beauty, Baron Mukow Jian of Pim Tung bought her as a house slave, but later took her as his third wife.</p>
<p>Ignoring the warnings of the other wives, Holang spied on the Baron until she uncovered his secret activities—building a secret rebel army—and until he caught her. Though he threatened to kill her, Holang saved herself by giving him better and more honest counsel than any of his advisors, thanks to her T'u Lung education and frank speech. Mukow let her live and started consulting her in secret, and thanks to her he found successes. Holang even disguised herself as a man and joined his secret army, the Vian-chi , and trained to fight as a ninja .</p>
<p>At age 34, Holang was Mukow's favored wife and her son was chosen as Mukow's heir. By 2607, Lady Holang had complete control over Pim Tung and commanded her own spies and warriors, and still had greater ambitions.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Lady Holang was the effective ruler of Pim Tung —her husband, as baron, had no actual political power under Tabotan law and the local dzong-pon (sheriff or district official) was her puppet, while the warriors of Pim Tung were her men. But Holang was plotting nothing less than the overthrow of the High Lord of Oceans Ning D'Ahn himself and turning Tabot into an empire much like T'u Lung, and to make her husband its emperor, and she its empress.</p>
<p>Thus, she'd had her spies infiltrate Jo'nai Gompa at all levels and she sent more to the capital at U'Chan Gompa . Her agents were common in Motra and Joya and bluntly interrogated anyone who passed through her lands, though Holang would allow free passage upriver to Phutan for those who paid. Moreover, she was in communication with the rebel Baron Phen Do of Khampo .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Holang was doe-eyed and beautiful, even in middle age, with long black hair. She was taller than most Tabotan women.</p>
