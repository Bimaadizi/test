<p>The Black Sword was a unique intelligent bastard sword from the ancient Imaskari Empire , crafted to aid in the overthrowing of an emperor during its height. It possessed the special purpose of overthrowing tyrants. Made of obsidian, the sword had been used to commit dozens of regicides since its creation. In 1360 DR , the Black Sword might have been in the City of Solon , where it intended to slay Raja Ambuchar Devayam at the first opportunity.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
