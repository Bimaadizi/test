<p>Wolffish was a species of cold-water fish that greatly resembled juvenile wolf eel . They inhabited the estuaries that fed into the Sea of Moving Ice in Icewind Dale .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Despite their wolf eel -like appearance, wolffish was a distinctly separate species of fish. They were believed to have been originally from the Bay of Raum or somewhere further east from the Sea of Moving Ice. One theory claimed that a naval explorer brought the species from the Great Ice Sea to the Sea of Moving Ice simple because he liked the taste of wolffish.</p>
