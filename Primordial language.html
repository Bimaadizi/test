<p>Primordial was the language of primordials and elementals . The Abyssal language was a form of Primordial warped and twisted by the evil of the Abyss . And some believed the Giant language was a debased form of it, though it had actually been taught to the giants fully formed by their creator god Annam .</p>
<p>It was also considered a language family, so that the elemental languages Aquan , Auran , Ignan , and Terran were considered a group of dialects of Primordial. They were sufficiently similar that creatures who understood one of those dialects could understand the others as well.</p>
<p>Primordial used the Barazhad script or the Dwarvish script.</p>
