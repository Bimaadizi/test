<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Valom possessed a unique cursed girdle , known as the belt of stones , that he had created himself.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Valom lived in a boat on the Sea of Fallen Stars , known as the Dim Courser . He was known to often hire lone mercenaries and sellswords to obtain components for magical items . When they returned to his floating laboratory he would bestow upon them his cursed belt of stones , then push them off, and because of its curse they would quickly drown.</p>
<p>One day, he performed this charade on a sellsword from Procampur named Herred , but he was unaware that the man had in his possession a potion of water breathing and a helm of underwater action . Herred later tracked Valom down, but was mistaken as a crazed seaweed monster by a priest of Tyr who proceeded to strike him down. The priest, having soon after realized his mistake, set upon Valom with three paladins . Valom managed to slay two of them before falling in battle himself.</p>
