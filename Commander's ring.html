<p>Commander's rings were magical rings made by the War Wizards of Cormyr for the kingdom's military commanders around 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>They helped the wearer resist deleterious effects and deflect attacks against them.</p>
<p>Three times a day each, the ring could produce the effects of daylight , feather fall , knock , and wall of force , but only when the correct command word was uttered.</p>
<p>If a Purple Dragon ring was worn on the same hand as this ring, they were treated as one ring, thus allowing a third ring on the other hand. The wearer was also able to sense the distance and direction of any Purple Dragon rings within 100 feet (30 meters), but this power of detection was blocked by sufficient thicknesses of stone, metal, wood, or other solid boundaries.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Creation of a commander's ring required the spells it could cast above, as well as locate object .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Royal Magician Ganrahast Aeiulvana , Lord Warder Vainrence , former Royal Magician Vangerdahast Aeiulvana , and Storm Silverhand found a way to enchant the rings to safely allow telepathic communication through the team and commander's rings , a feat previously impossible because of the aftereffects of the Spellplague .</p>
