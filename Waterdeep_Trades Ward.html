<p>The Trades Ward was one of the seven wards of the city of Waterdeep . It was the main shopping district of Waterdeep and housed many of the city's guildhalls.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The ward was bounded in the south by the Southern Ward , in the west by Castle Ward , in the north by North Ward and the City of the Dead and in the east by the Trollwall .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR , over the course of a tenday and more, streets across the Trades Ward experienced a number of ghostly sightings that left many citizens, scribes, and members of the City Watch confused. Some speculated if a wizard experimenting with illusions may have been the cause. Others speculated it was a wizard seeking to harm local businesses, drive down local property values, or simply spread fear—though all who put forward these theories admitted to having nothing to backup their claims.</p>
<p>Some interpreted the apparitions as being a message — Sambral the Soothsayer would claim the dead were warning Waterdhavians of impending battles from underground invaders, Sheireera of the Prophecies would claim that it was the dead crying out against immorality and lawlessness in Waterdeep, and priest Thalomaun of the Church of Lathander would make a proclamation on Virgin's Square that it was a sign from the dead for the living of the affected neighborhoods to do away with old businesses and make way for new ones.</p>
