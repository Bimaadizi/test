<p>Mabda was a mad crone healer who lived in the woods on the outskirts of in Gillian's Hill , a small hamlet along the Trade Way circa 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mabda was an old woman with deep wrinkles, wild head of white hair, and her eyes burned with a fire, uncharacteristically for a woman her age. She usually was wrapped in robes and scarves.</p>
<p>Her speech patterns were wild and seemingly random, while she had an animated body language. Some said she had uncanny precognitive abilities, and she often claimed to have seen things that were to come. However, it was hard to confirm and was almost indistinguishable from ravings of a lunatic.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The crone believes that the trees and plants around her tent could communicate with her and only her.</p>
<p>She possessed healing magics similar to those of a cleric .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1372 DR , Gillian's Hill was affected by a strange vampirism -like plague, the Hero of Daggerford was asked to investigate into the disease. Callaway , one of the farmers, agreed to guide the heroes to old Mabda's tent, who believed she knew the stories of a mythic bat monster who might be responsible for the plague. Callaway thought the old healer woman to be a complete loon, however. Mabda claimed to have foreign the adventurer's arrival. Mabda quickly revealed that vampires were not responsible for the outbreak, but it was Gothma , a creature of local legends. The stories claimed that Gothma was a giant vampire bat that swooped on cows and sheeps at night. The creature was said to live in the old crypts under the Gillian's Hill's cemetery.</p>
