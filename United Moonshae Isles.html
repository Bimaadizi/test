<p>The United Moonshae Isles was a kingdom that spanned the whole of the Moonshae Isles in the Sea of Swords when it was founded in the mid-to-late-14 th century DR , bringing together the Ffolk and Northlander realms for the first time. By the late 15 th century DR, it had been reduced to only the island of Alaron , and was thus sometimes referred to as the realm or kingdom of Alaron .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The United Moonshae Isles were ruled over by the High Kings and Queens of the Kendrick dynasty, sometimes referred to as the High Throne . They were served by the various lesser Ffolk kings of the southern Moonshaes even before the creation of the United Moonshae Isles. The Northmen kings retained their traditional lands and power under the Kendricks, but were retitled as "Jarls" in recognition as their new status as vassal-kings. It was said that the Kendricks maintained a network of portals connecting the capitals and other key sites around the isles.</p>
<p>The coat of arms of the United Moonshae Isles was the same as that of the reigning Kendrick family: a bear 's head. It was displayed on banners and shields where the High King or High Queen reigned.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The Ffolk and Northlander warriors of the realm proved to be powerful allies, however they sometimes found the need to hire adventurers to help them counter threats from enemy wizards .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Under the United Moonshae Isles, the people of the Moonshaes forged greater ties with mainland Faerûn in contrast to their historic isolationism. In particular, they opened a formal embassy in Waterdeep .</p>
<p>The kingdom had a contentious history with Amn , with it being believed in the late 14 th century DR that they were working to undermine and stoke unrest against Kendrick rule. This would ultimately be proven true when they invaded and burned the southern isles at the turn of the 15 th century DR, cementing Amn as a lasting enemy and rival even as the Amnians became more economically entrenched throughout the Moonshaes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was established by High Queen Alicia Kendrick of the Ffolk in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , after the Northmen kings of the Sea of Moonshae swore fealty to her at the encouragement of King Olafsson . During a glorious ceremony, High Queen Alicia signed a proclamation that established the United Moonshae Isles. This act united the two long-time rival peoples under a single banner for the first time in their fractious history. However, violence did not end completely between the two groups, and enforcing Ffolk justice against unruly Northlanders threatened to spark rebellion if not handled with care.</p>
<p>The realm lost control of Oman's Isle to an invasion of firbolgs and fomorians in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR . It then lost control of Gwynneth following the return of the ancient fey realm of Sarifal beginning in the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR . It lost control of Moray during the Spellplague when Caer Moray was overrun by lycanthropes . It also lost Snowdown to an Amnian invasion in the Year of the Sceptered One, 1404 DR . Around the same time, the kingdom was rocked by wars with separatists and insurgents sparked by the self-proclaimed true High King Lionel Carrathal , leaving scars that weakened the Kendrick High Kings and Queens for decades to follow. High Queen Alicia herself would die in the Year of the Halls Unhaunted, 1407 DR , likely due to assassination.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Norland had seceded and Norheim was likewise no longer under Kendrick rule. The United Moonshae Isles continued to nominally exist through the late 15 th century DR when it was ruled by High King Derid Kendrick . While many Ffolk and even some Northlanders across the Isles still felt loyal to him, his power only extended across the island of Alaron, encompassing the Kingdom of Callidyrr in the south and Gnarhelm in the north. Although diminished, this realm remained perhaps the mightiest in the Moonshaes at this time. As of the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , High King Derid was undertaking efforts to reclaim territory on Oman, Gwynneth, and Moray.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Under the United Moonshae Isles, Ffolk and Northlanders mingled together more than ever before, even settling each other's islands and intermarrying. This began to erode cultural differences between them, leading to many shared traditions. The Ffolk's veneration of the land and the Northlanders' reverence for the sea also combined into a general respect for and desire to protect both. This was most extreme on the island of Alaron, where the peoples of Callidyrr and Gnarhelm came to see themselves as "Moonshavians" first rather than as Ffolk or Northlander. By contrast, the Northlanders of Norland retained much of their old culture, even as their lives shifted to become more peaceful.</p>
