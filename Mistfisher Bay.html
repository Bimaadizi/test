<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The name of Immer Bay came from the river named the Immer Stream that cascaded from the Spring Hill and eventually reached the bay of Dragonmere where Immersea stood. The other name came from the local attraction: the fleet of colorful "Mist Fishers" that sailed into the lake during sunrise and sailed back into the town's harbors at sunset. The natural beauty of the lake made "Mist Fishers" popular among visitors.</p>
