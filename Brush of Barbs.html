<p>The Brush of Barbs was a secluded and thorny overgrown forest that was the home of Govan Irfandel 's druidic Stone Circle of Govan.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Brush of Barbs was a wood overgrown with thickets of thorns that strangled the trees . The forest was wild and secluded as it was a dangerous challenge trying to trek through, with some areas completely inaccessible, hidden behind impenetrable walls of brambles.</p>
<p>The Brush of Barbs could be reached by foot, however the track from Daggerford to the Brush took approximately 12 hours.</p>
<p>The Brush's wild forest paths were often covered in thick webs and the trees held numerous giant and dire spiders , as well as ettercaps , waiting for a beast or a traveler to become trapped. The area held several small caves and the northeast of the Brush ended in a deep ravine with a stream flowing at the bottom. Several bushes of fenberry grew on the ravine's edge. Among other wild life, badgers could be found in the Brush of Barbs.</p>
<p>A couple of huge ancient trees, known as the Twin Oaks , marked the magically hidden entrance into the druid sanctuary of the Stone Circle of Govan. It was sealed from outsiders by enchanted vines that only parted to grant passage if a password was spoken.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1072 DR , elf Govan Irfandel set out to build a shelter, a meeting ground, and a place to hold rituals for his fellow druids who venerated the powers of good. Govan channeled his magical affinities with the local flora and fauna, enlisting its help with the project. He used the trees and vines to drag the giant slabs of stone into place, constructing the druidic stone circle in the heart of the thickets. It became known as the Stone Circle of Govan.</p>
<p>In 1372 DR , a young wanna-be adventurer Fernigold the Younger of Daggerford came into possession of a map that led him to the old and forgotten Telarthir's tomb. The young man craved gold and adventure. He found a way past the magical gates of the tomb but quickly lost his life to the tomb's undead inhabitants. The man's body was recovered by the Hero of Daggerford .</p>
