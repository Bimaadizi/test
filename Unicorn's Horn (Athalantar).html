<h2>History</h2>
<p>In or before Flamerule of the Year of Bloodflowers, 234 DR , the Mystran priestess Elmara (secretly prince Elminster Aumar of Athalantar ) went to the Unicorn's Horn after delivering Ondil's Book of Spells to Mystra's Dance at the mouth of the Delimbiyr. It took her a whole day's walk to get there. Once she arrived, she crossed paths with seven apprentice Magelords of Athalantar , who attacked a minstrel for singing the Ballad of the Stag , a song about Uthgrael Aumar . She stopped their spell , and then cast a spell that cut off all their magic. Rather than fighting them with spells, she asked all present if they'd like to brawl instead. In doing so, one of the magelords died, while the other six were knocked out. Elmara cast a spell that turned all of them to stone and then transported them to the waters near Mystra's Dance. According to her, once the spell wore off, they'd better swim fast.</p>
<p>Prince Gartos was later sent to capture her for these transgressions.</p>
