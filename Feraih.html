<p>Feraih was a forager from Al Qahara in Raurin as of 1374 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>She left in that year to investigate the nearby Palace of the Purple Emperor , which had been returned to Raurin by Pandorym together with her companions Ghanim and Haleem . While the latter two entered to explore, she remained outside, waiting for them to return. After half a day, she noticed the entrance had vanished as if it had never existed; she tried hammers, minor enchantments of opening, and even prayer, to no avail. Two days later, she returned to Al Qahara.</p>
<p>Even though she never entered it, some curse slew her in her sleep on the first night she was back. Her enchanted sword, Sadrul , was later bequeathed upon a visiting Kiril Duskmourn , who was on the way to the same ruin that had swallowed Feraih's companions.</p>
