<p>East Rift was formed during the Spellplague and was located as a shelf on the side of Underchasm .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the Spellplague many of the Gond worshipers from the destroyed nation of Lantan gathered in this region to explore the ruins of ancient civilizations that had been pushed to the surface in the wake of the Underchasm's creation. They were known to be working alongside gold dwarves in this effort and used many salvage companies.</p>
<p>Eventually, the Deep Lords allowed the the Gondsmen to construct a permanent residence in the area. The subsequent construction of a new temple to their god was led by Cavandro the Cunning .</p>
