<p>Erevan Ilesere ( pronounced : /ˈ ɛər ɛ v ɑː n ˈ ɪ l ɛ s ɪər / AIR-eh-van ILL-eh-seer ) was the elven god of mischief and rogues . Having lost power in the Spellplague , he became an exarch of Corellon . His titles included the Trickster and the Chameleon.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Erevan was a shapechanger and had numerous guises. As his avatar , Erevan would choose to appear as either an elf or a type of fey , usually a brownie , pixie , or sprite , of wildly different appearances and sizes. Regardless of what form he was in, Erevan always wore green somewhere on his body as a symbol of his love for the forests where fey and elves live.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Erevan was an unpredictable, flighty, fun-loving god. He enjoyed causing harmless trouble and playing pranks above all else. He was seeming unable to stay still or focus on single task for any sizable period of time. Despite his fickle nature, Erevan was ferociously loyal to the Seldarine and protective of the sylvan races and elves when they are threatened. Erevan had no respect for those who relied on his help to solve all their problems, however. He instead favored those who relied on themselves and those who were underdogs.</p>
<h2>Clergy</h2>
<p>Erevan's church was an unorganized group of rogues and tricksters. His priests often joined regional branches, though such commitments were fluid and entirely voluntary. Contact between the different regions was uncommon. Novices of the clergy were known as the Gullible, while full-flegded priests were known as Quicksilvers and specialty priests were called Mischiefmakers. Regardless of ranks, all clerics of Erevan were expected to regularly change their titles and even create their own. Most priests were moon elves , green elves , or half-elves . Priests of Erevan had very few duties as priests. Most were wild and unpredictable, who taught through example and trained skills needed for trickster rogues. They delighted in breaking the rules and upsetting those in power. The Erevanian clerics dressed in black leather armor with leather caps.</p>
<p>His priests never worshiped him in the same place twice. Despite this restriction, Erevan did have a few holy places where his followers would take pilgrims to. Most notable of all was Quicksilver's Lair , a expansive cavern overlooking Arglander River within the High Peaks . It is said that it used to be the home of one of Erevan's companions, the mercury dragon Avachel . The cavern was later home to many mercury dragons who claimed to be descendants of Avachel. The lair was filled with valuables brought by priests of Erevan, who all hoped to pray there once. The way there was hidden, however, and the High Peaks were strewn with treasure from priests that never found the entrance.</p>
<p>Though no knightly orders were established within the clergy of Erevan, a number of guilds and groups dedicated themselves to the Trickster. Notably, the Knaves of The Missing Page , who were a band of elven mage-thieves that recovered elven magic items and artifacts that had been acquired by other races, mostly humans. The Knaves were located in the Vale of Evereska, but could be found throughout Faerûn .</p>
<p>Though tales of the clergy's shenanigans and adventures were enjoyed by elven children and commoners, who enjoyed their pranks against stuffy nobles and elders, Everan's worshipers were often met with suspicion when in person.</p>
<h2>Holy Days and Rituals</h2>
<p>Erevan's holy days were on the eclipses, and his faithful sacrificed stolen treasures to him whenever they felt it was appropriate.</p>
<p>Worshipers of Erevan hosted a Midnight Gambol once a month under the light of a full moon . Though the location of each Midnight Gambol was a secret, it was always held in a sylvan glade. The precise location of the event was something followers of Erevan passed around by word of mouth leading up to the event, but anyone, faithful or otherwise, who learned of the event using their own wits were welcomed to join in on the festivities. Pixies, sprites, and other tricksters of the Seelie Court also participated in the celebration. Activities included dancing, storytelling, drinking wine , playing pranks, and sacrificing beautiful objects.</p>
