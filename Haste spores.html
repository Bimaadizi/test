<p>Haste spores was a substance created by myconids ' spongy blue spore sacks. These spores could be bottled and used in a somewhat similar way to potion of speed .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Haste spores were minuscule living particles generated by myconids. These spores were white in color and buzzed in constant speedy agitation. When bottled up, the spores could be seen swarming inside the container.</p>
<p>Inside a myconid's haste spore sack, spores felt light and fluffy, making anyone touching them feel a tingling sensation in their feet and made heart pace quicker. The intact spore sack extracted from a dead myconid was valued at fifty five gp .</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Some myconids and myconid colonies offered vials of their haste spores as boons or gestures of good will towards their allies. Haste spores could also be extracted from a slain myconid and bottled for the future use.</p>
