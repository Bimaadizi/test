<p>Satyrdance Pool was a pond in Myth Drannor , a possession of the Tornglara family, and a socializing spot for the matriarchs of several houses as of the mid-to-early 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The pool was located in a private garden, behind House Tornglara.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Satyrdance was the "wannest" of several pools. It had a wooden path leading up to it. An oval mirror hung from a shadowtop tree close to the pool, and many branches were low enough to hang clothes from.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Every fourth day after highsunfeast, the ladies of several houses met there as of 241 DR. The pool was spiced with rosewater for such occasions, and refreshments were served.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Hippogriff's Folly, 241 DR , a meeting hosted by Alaglossa Tornglara , and attended by Ithrythra Mornmist , Duilya Evendusk , and Cilivren Doedance resulted in the four ladies agreeing they expected Elminster , a human , being given the honor of being named armathor would result in the eventual assassination of the Coronal Eltargrim Irithyl , with the ensuing succession fight causing extreme damage. In light of this eventuality, they made a vague resolution to try and prevent Cormanthor from coming apart in spite of the human being named an armathor.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>It was said that the Tornglara ladies used a mirror by the pool to scry into human cities for fashions they might want to copy.</p>
