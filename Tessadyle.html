<p>Tessadyle was a kind of stringy fungus that grew in the Underdark near regions of increased psionic activity. Because of this, it was most commonly found near mind flayer communities. Tessadyle was a psionically reactive fungus, which made it perfect for psionic circuitry. The fungus could also be used to make a substance similar to durable cloth. Because of all of this, mind flayers commonly used this fungus to make clothing. One such article of clothing was the tessadyle robe .</p>
