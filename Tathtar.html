<p>Tathtar was a small kingdom in the vicinity of the Deepwash , occupying territory in the Deepwing Mountains , Cloven Mountains , and the High Peaks . It was sometimes divided into two parts; Upper Tathtar, north of the Deepwash, and Lower Tathtar, to its south.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was founded in 227 DR apparently as a human realm, though some accounts mentioned it as being mixed human and dwarven .</p>
<p>For the decade following 230 DR , Tathtar attempted to expand into eastern Tethyr . The Tathtar Wars , as they were called, were a cause of irritation for Emperor Shoon IV . The wars finally came to an end as the result of peace treaties.</p>
<p>Upper Tathtar was destroyed in 293 DR when it was overrun by an orc horde commanded by chieftain Thaurgarl "Greatmaw" . Lower Tathtar survived the conflict.</p>
<p>Lower Tathtar was to survive for almost 500 years more. In 731 DR , its armies once again sought to control regions east of Tethyr, specifically the wilderness that once was Elestam . They were repelled by King Strohm II , who then officially re-instituted Elestam as part of Tethyr. His successor, Strohm III , continued battling Tathtar throughout his reign.</p>
<p>Lower Tathtar was finally destroyed in 796 DR by a plague caused by the vampire Shyressa , who was herself a citizen of the kingdom. By as late as 1370 DR , monsters and brigands dwelt in the eastern ruins of the kingdom.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The capital of Tathtar was disputed, sometimes thought to be Tulhaspyr , at other times Dajaan , and still others thought the southern capital to be Saalirk .</p>
<p>Much of the remnants of Lower Tathtar would become inhabited by Sala-min Lion Warriors, centered on the ruins of Saalirk, which also held numerous creatures, both magical and undead placed there by Shyressa, who made it her home. Wyverns from the Cloven Mountains were also noted to inhabit what remained of the crumbling ruins of the region.</p>
<p>Upper Tathtar lay mostly in the Deepwing Mountains, most noted for its flying predators such as griffons , hippogriffs , manticores , red dragons , and wyverns</p>
