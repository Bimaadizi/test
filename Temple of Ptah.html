<p>The Temple of Ptah was a temple in the city of Bral dedicated to Ptah , a Pharaonic deity popular among wildspace wanderers. And was one of the newest temples of Ptah across Wildspace.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This temple was located in the Temple District of the Middle City of Bral.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This temple was constructed of stone and had a distinctly ancient style to its design. When it was originally founded, the temple was built to emulate the style of temples found on worlds where the Pharaonic pantheon was worshiped â€” the stones of the temple were aged to simulate weathering and its interior was filled with all manner of archeological relics and treasures.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>In addition to regularly holding religious observances and services, the Temple of Ptah featured a large hostelry for travelers to stay at.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Besides its clergy, the Temple of Ptah was home to a small force of templars that guarded the temple grounds. The head priestess of the temple was Andaclesia .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Temple of Ptah was established on the Rock of Bral back during its days of piracy. Overtime, the pressing demands of spelljamming cultures drove its priests to abandon their traditional, Pharaonic style of ceremonies and vestments, and replace them with more conventional ones.</p>
<p>With careful management of the temple by Andaclesia, the Temple of Ptah grew to eventually become not only one of the wealthiest and most influential temples in Bral in the 14 th century DR , but one of Ptah's most important temples across Wildspace. And under her management it was set to continue expanding its influence in the years to come.</p>
