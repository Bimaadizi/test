<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The gauntlets of valor granted their wearers complete immunity to magics such as charm , domination , entanglement , hold , paralysis , sleep , and web . Additionally, the gauntlets of valor could be used as enchanted +2 melee weapons three times a day. Each landed punch had a chance of landing devastating, crushing damage to the target, rendering them stunned for several seconds.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Power Arms were created in the days of pre- Weeping War Myth Drannor. These enchanted gauntlets were crafted to be used by the City of Song's champions, defending their home in times of dire need. By the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , only three sets of these Arms were known to exist. The gauntlets of valor , one of the three surviving Arm wets, were in possession of a blind dwarven smith who inhabited the icy depths of Gloomfrost in Icewind Dale circa 1281 DR . By the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , that pair of gauntlets of valor reached the hands of Regis , the " Halfling Hero of Lonelywood ," and was available for purchase from his shop.</p>
