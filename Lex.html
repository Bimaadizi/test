<p>Lex was a henchwoman, or perhaps pet, to the Talontar blightlord Damanda in 1373 DR . She was a bone-slender woman with a shock of close-cropped hair, purple like dead flowers; she carried a number of tomes, wands, and scrolls on her belt. While fighting Marrec 's party, Lex was protected by a spell akin to shield , and she employed a spell that threatened to hold Marrec and paralyzed Elowen , most likely mass hold person , but she was backstabbed by Fallon before she could finish off the ranger she enspelled.</p>
<p>She had been the one to pen her mistress' scroll of escape.</p>
