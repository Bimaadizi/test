<p>Srossar was a bronze dragon possessed by Tyranthraxus .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Srossar was an ancient dragon. Around 1240 DR , some agents of Tyranthraxus (who were in turn deceived) tricked Srossar into believing that bathing in the pool of radiance , a portal to an unknown dark plane underneath Valjevo Castle , would give him greater wisdom and understanding of the metaphysics of the universe.</p>
<p>However, in truth, when the dragon entered the pool, Srossar was possessed by Tyranthraxus. Tyranthraxus immediately commenced building an army of monsters for the subjugation of Faerûn.</p>
<p>Using Srossar's body, Tyranthraxus took control of most of the city of Phlan until 1340 DR .</p>
<p>In that year, an adventuring party hired by Councilman Porphyrys Cadorna defeated Tyranthraxus, killing Srossar in the process.</p>
