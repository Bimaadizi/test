<p>The Philosophy of Kara-Tur was a tome of knowledge about the eastern continent of Kara-Tur , penned sometime before 1281 DR .</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>One notable excerpt from the tome was a story from the eastern lands about a conversation between two chaste shukenja . When the two chaste men came across a beautiful woman taking shelter under a tree by the side of a road, she noticed the man and called out to them. The beautiful woman asked the men to carry her across a stream. The first shukenja immediately set out to aid her while the other man silently protested. The first man carried the woman in his arms with ease across the stream and returned to the road to go his way. The second man stayed silent until the beautiful woman was out of sight and then spoke out: "We shukenja are not supposed to have contact with women! Why did you pick that woman up so casually and carry her across the stream?" His monastic brother replied: "Brother, I set the woman down long ago. Why is it that you have not?"</p>
<h2>History</h2>
