<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Unforgotten Fire, 319 DR , the Turmish Emperor at the time, Shoon VII , took drastic measures ridding the cities of Ankhapur, Calimport , Innarlith , and Ithmong of their criminal underworlds. He ordered oil to be poured into their respective sewers, causing the Great Fires that destroyed the four cities nearly completely, with a deathtoll numbering over three million people.</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, Ankhapur was one among many cities that raise or instate new taxes in order to pay for civic utilities such as its sewer, defensive walls, public pumps and troughs, and streets.</p>
