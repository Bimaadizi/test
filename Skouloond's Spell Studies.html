<p>Skouloond's Spell Studies was an academic magic textbook written by the Netherese arcanist Skouloond .</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>The book was an examination of verbal , somatic , and material components . It focused on how to alter and substitute these components, for the purpose of modifying existing spells and inventing new ones. It was similar to a substitution guide for cooking, teaching spellcasters the basics of adapting and experimenting with known formulae.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Skouloond's Spell Studies was considered a classic and foundational piece of arcane science by the arcanists of Netheril during the Age of Discovery ( 2654 NY (−1205 DR) onwards). Any respectable arcane library would be expected to contain a copy of it, along with others such as Haerro's Veltanabula , Sarturl's Study of Magical Fields , Oloam's on Serpentine Matters , and Ivrynxra's Exploration of Enchantments .</p>
