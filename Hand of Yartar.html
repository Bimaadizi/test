<p>The Hand of Yartar was a largely female guild of thieves and assasins operating within the city of Yartar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1365 DR , the Hand of Yartar was mostly female according to Volo and most were also young, as an old thief who had trouble outrunning a mark if they botched a theft would not live long.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR , the Hand of Yartar member Nareen Dhest stole a devastation orb from the Lord Protector's vaults in Triboar . Having no use for the weapon, the guild attempted to auction the item in the Wink and Kiss tavern in Yartar. However, another Hand named Haliyra Ravenfast secretly attempted to sell the item to agents of the Kraken Society instead.</p>
