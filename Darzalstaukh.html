<p>Darzalstaukh , which was also called the City of Dark Dreams , was a powerful kingdom of duergar that existed beneath the Sunrise Mountains in Rashemen during the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Though the duergar had yet to threaten Rashemen as of the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , the Rashemaar were nonetheless wary of the sinister gray dwarves. Given that drow were sometimes spotted in the Running Rocks , the Rashemaar assumed the Underdark was contiguously connected beneath Rashemen, which would allow the duergar to strike wherever they wished. The hathrans hoped to broker some kind of trade deal with the duerger in order to obtain valuable iron ore and other metals.</p>
