<h2>History</h2>
<p>Marek Rymüt was a clandestine Red Wizard who had been operating as a secret Thayan agent in Innarlith since the 1340s DR. He posed as a wizard who sold magical items and services without any allegiance to the Red Wizards. In 1365 DR, he assisted Senator Salatis in overthrowing Ransar Osorkon , the leader of the city-state, with an army of black firedrakes that he had bred. Following Salatis' seizure of power, Salatis agreed to Marek's demand for the creation of the Thayan enclave in Innarlith.</p>
<p>This enclave supplied magical items and services for customers. Marek had already gained a near-monopoly on the control of the magic trade in Innarlith even before the establishment of the enclave. After it was established, it was used to supply magical services and items to customers in the city-state.</p>
<p>Senator Willem Korvan was married to Senator Inthelph 's daughter Phyrea in a Cyricist ceremony within the Thayan enclave in 1367 DR . He was later secretly murdered and raised as an undead servant by Marek in the enclave in 1368 DR .</p>
<p>Phyrea later stole an enchanted flamberge that Marek had used to make Willem into an undead creature from the enclave in 1374 DR .</p>
<p>Senator Pristoleph became the largest customer of the enclave before his coming to power as Ransar in 1371 DR . However, he later turned against the Thayan presence in Innarlith, leading to him banishing Marek and his allies following their failed attempt to overthrow him in 1374 DR .</p>
