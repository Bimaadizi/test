<p>Korus Eikoth was the younger twin of Hassan Arslan, and second in the line of succession to the Oasis of the White Palm , as of 1356Â DR . Resentful of his older twin brother, he had conspired to have both him and his father assassinated.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Korus was basically dishonest and could not be counted to keep his word. He would lie and cheat to get his way.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Korus was the youngest twin by minutes; this made him ineligible to become the next Sheik. Because of his jealousy and lust for power, he let himself be used by the underground dervish cult within the Oasis of the White Palm.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Korus wielded an enchanted scimitar, and a stronger, enchanted chain mail. He also carried six enchanted arrows, an a potion of ESP . He had three enchanted maces to turn over, should the adventurers agree to go to him first on finding the princess.</p>
<p>The prince kept a chest in his tent. There was a poison needle in the lock, and inside the tent, there were 20 pounds of silver, 5 pounds of electrum, and 5 pounds of gold alongside an unmarked bottle of poison. The real treasure was buried in the sand, one foot beneath the chest: wrapped in a rug, there was another chest containing 30 pounds of gold, 10 pounds of platinum, and 8 gems, each of which was worth as much as 20 pounds of gold. There were also two potions: a potion of brass dragon control, and a red liquid that seemed to glow slightly. This liquid ignited and exploded when exposed to air.</p>
<p>Korus' favourite slave was an elven woman named Kerina .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>While physically more resilient and far stronger than his brother, Korus' nimbleness still fell short of his twin's.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He sought to find his brother's missing bride, but not out of goodness; rather, he knew that she was key to seizing power in the oasis. Korus wasn't above pretending to be his broter for the sake of concealing his activities and used this stratagem when he offered payment beyond what the sheik had offered to the adventurers for finding the princess, if only they would turn her over directly to him. He planned on having them killed as soon as he had the princess.</p>
<p>The prince was secretly a member of the dervish cult operating within the Oasis. He could be found in his tent from dawn to midnight, lounging while having his slave dance for him. Every night, starting one hour after sunset, Korus would head for the monolith in the oasis, and enter the temple of Set through a secret entrance, for worship. Per his favourite slave, he donned a black robe in preparation for these evening services. He knew that the leader of the dervish cult planned on turning the missing princess over to a powerful spiritual ally.</p>
<p>Korus was aware someone had taken over the Sandvoyagers' Guild.</p>
