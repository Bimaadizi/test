<p>In the Year of the Nether Mountain Scrolls, 1486 DR , three Chosen of Silvanus got together on Sapra with the leaders of the Turmishan druidic order known as the Emerald Enclave and conducted a magical ritual that ended a famine that had been plaguing that nation. This caused all manner of food to instantaneously grow throughout the land, including carrots.</p>
