<p>The Toga of Zagyg was a bedsheet that gave the impression of having great magical power. In the late 15 th century DR , it was in the collection of the morkoth M'warien on his island in the Sea of Swords . It was stored in a glass cylinder and labelled with a metal plaque. M'warien hypnotised a group of four merfolk who became compelled to dance around the toga.</p>
