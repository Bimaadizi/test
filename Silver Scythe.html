<p>The Silver Scythe was an inn in the town of Ghars , Cormyr , in the midâ€“14 th century DR . It was owned by Garnet Pennorth .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>While not a large inn, a grand meeting room was added in 1367 DR.</p>
<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
<p>Volo described the Silver Scythe as "forgettable, but not dreadful". The food was equally average, but passed for fine dining in Ghars. While it was not simply a place for drinking, there was a bar for patrons.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hosting the annual meeting of the Merchants' Guild in the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , the local merchant Barthelm Meadowbrock arranged for the guild members and their retinues to be lodged in both the Silver Scythe and the Sheaf of Wheat , since there were too many for one inn to accommodate. Barthelm also paid for Garnet to add a grand meeting room onto the inn, as well as supervised the stocking of its larder and cellar and brought chefs from Suzail . The guild members arrived on Eleint 19 with the meeting itself to be held the next day .</p>
