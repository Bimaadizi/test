<p>Master Vondin Clatch was a deaf master warrior who learned to use his impairment to aid him in battle sometime before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Vondin Clatch was quite ruthless and dangerous on a battlefield despite being completely deaf. He used a special enchanted morningstar Drone in battle which glowed and vibrated and created a powerful sonic boom around Vondin. The stunning wave of sound was the warrior's main tool. When Vondin retired, Drone was passed along to his apprentice, who did not share Vondin's impairment and was forced to pay a mage to focus the weapon's sonic boom on the target of the strikes exclusively.</p>
