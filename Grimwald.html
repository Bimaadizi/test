<p>Grimwald was a legendary mage of The Covenant and founder of the School of Wizardry in Waterdeep (previously Neverwinter ). He was known to have lived in the Tower Terrible in Wrinklestone in the Sword Coast North , before traveling beyond the world of Toril .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>While his physical appearance was that of a hunched-over, untidy man who often muttered to himself, Grimwald was known for having a kind heart.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Grimwald founded the School of Wizardry in 457 DR , along with the other renowned wizards Aganazzar , Ilyykur , and Presper . Over two hundred years later, in 673 DR , they founded an arcane organization known as The Covenant with the aim of fostering, and enforcing, peace between the warring tribes of the North . They marked this occasion by the creation of a collective spellbook known as the Tome of the Covenant , which possessed spells of each mage's creation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the mage's apprentices never took on the pact of their masters and the school went largely inactive for many years. Years later, in 1101 DR , Grimwald and Presper began to embark on a series of adventures through portals , but only returned to Toril a few times in between travels, the last known visit occurring in 1298 DR . Grimwald's home was looted long before 1372 DR .</p>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR , Grimwald and Presper encountered the wizard Savengriff in their travels across the planes. After some discussion, the three decided to reform the Covenant, this time based in the city of Waterdeep .</p>
