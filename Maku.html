<p>Maku was a priest shaman and leader of the minotaurs in the Maze Level in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Maku led his fellow twenty-three minotaurs against the drow of House Freth . He tried to summon Baphomet many times but with no success. The demon lord simply ignored Maku and his tribe but the minotaur believed that if he collected enough sacrificed bodies then the ritual would succeed. For him, all intruders were enemies to add to the pile of bodies.</p>
