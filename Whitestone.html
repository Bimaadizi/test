<p>Whitestone was a dwarven citadel in the Tears of Selûne . It was home to the Whitebeards , a clan of mountain dwarves who mined the mountains in the Neverwinter Wood during winter.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The citadel was a mountain-sized city, carved out of an enormous white stone. It was shaped to resemble a helmed long-bearded dwarf warrior.</p>
<p>The citadel's main entrance was through the figure's "mouth". The entrance led to a lake on which a number of spelljammers were kept docked for different purposes.</p>
<p>Whitestone's slow orbit around Toril and its own motion within the Tears brought it closest to the planet during winter in north Faerûn . The dwarves took advantage of this proximity to send mining ships to Mount Hotenow and the surrounding areas in the Neverwinter Wood .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The Whitebeards were led by King Gundulph Whitebeard VII .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Whitestone was guarded by a fleet of huge stone ships .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in the mid-14 th century DR , the crew of one of the mining ships was captured and held hostage by a crew of pirates from a marooned nautiloid that had crash-landed on the Neverwinter River after a battle with one of the stone warships that guarded Whitestone.</p>
