<p>The Jardeth ( pronounced : /ˈ dʒ ɑːr d ɛ θ / JAR-deth ) family was one of the noble houses of Waterdeep circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . They were known for providing trained soldiers and guards, including provisioning and garrisoning.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The patriarch of the family was Ulb Jardeth from at least the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , to at least 1372 DR. His consort was Lady Allys and their eldest son was Koris . There were forty-one noble members of the clan as of 1372 DR.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>

They were one of four families that sponsored a trade mission to Maztica that eventually became the colony of New Waterdeep . House Jardeth was responsible for the defense of the colony, conducting drills, and recruiting and training new guards.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>

The west side of the estate fronted on Whaelgond Way overlooking the intersection with Delzorin Street . The somewhat triangular grounds faced Saerdoun Street to the northeast and an alley to the southeast. Directly across Saerdoun Street was the Gralhund family villa.</p>
<p>The Jardeths also has significant holdings and a garrison of troops in New Waterdeep.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Jardeths were of Chondathan descent and worshiped Helm . They were ennobled in the Year of the Cockatrice, 1248 DR , along with many of their fellow merchant gentry families. As of 1372 DR, there were forty-one living members.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR , the Jardeths were part of a flotilla of twelve ships that attempted to establish trade at Helmsport in Maztica, but the Lord-Governor of New Amn turned them away, citing limits on transoceanic trade that had been put in place by the Council of Six . The trade armada eventually landed on Maztapan Island and in the space of two months established the New Waterdeep colony.</p>
