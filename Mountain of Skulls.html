<p>The Mountain of Skulls was a temple of Cyric found within the Cloud Peaks of Amn circa the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple was built within a nearly inaccessible cavern, 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) into a gaping gorge, some 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of the Fangs .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>A skull-shaped opening formed the cave in which the temple was founded.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The Mountain of Skulls earned its name from the massive mound of skulls that lay within its center. This horrific display was treated as an idol by the local Cyricists.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The temple was overseen by Watchful Skull Tynnos Argrim , founder of the order of assassins known as the Flames of the Dark Sun . Argrim's priests were seen as heretics by the Cyricists of the Twin Towers of the Eternal Eclipse .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The temple was once dedicated to the god Bane , before being claimed by Cyricists during the Amnian Banedeath in the Year of the Helm, 1362 DR .</p>
<p>In the summer of the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Watchful Skull Argrim slew the leader of the Dark Redoubt within the temple's premises and forced its clergy to fall under his own leadership.</p>
<p>The Mountain of Skulls endured the decades of languish experienced by the Cyricist faith, and remained standing as of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR .</p>
