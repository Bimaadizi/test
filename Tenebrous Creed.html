<p>The Tenebrous Creed , previously known as the Black Ice , was a sect of Shar -worshipers that devoted themselves to releasing the elder evil Father Llymic from imprisonment within the Thunder Peaks mountain range.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Tenebrous Creed sought to unleash the evil of the entombed Father Lymic to bring more glory in Shar 's name. They believed he would consume the entire world of Toril , similar to the goddess' scheme to carry out her Cycle of Night . Yet others within the group wanted to transform into immortal, crystalline versions of their own selves.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The group set up a base camp in the Thunder Peaks near Father Lymic's frozen, mountaintop prison.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Unlike other Sharran sects, apostles of the Tenebrous Creed wore bright yellow robes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The sect's history dates back to when Father Lymic was brought to the Realms from the Far Realm by elves from Myth Drannor . On that occasion some followers of Shar received a prophetic tenet that was subsequently passed down in the centuries that followed. This came to be known as the Tenebrous Creed , from which the organization took its name.</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , the Tenebrous Creed managed to access the Supreme Forge beneath the lost Abeiran city of Xorvintroth . They wanted to learn how a group in the city known as the Inquest made contact with Father Lymic and earned his favor.</p>
<p>During their expedition they uncovered the artifact known as the Gauntlet of One , tapped into the memories of dead dragonborn to learn more secrets about the Far Realm, and inadvertently let loose some Far Realm energy within one of the forge's workshops. The leaders of the sect even managed to briefly bring forth an aspect of Father Lymic by means of an improvised portal to the Far Realm, but were thwarted by a band of adventurers .</p>
