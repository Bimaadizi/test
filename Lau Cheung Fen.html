<p>Lau Cheung Fen was a Shou merchant and an important dignitary from Shou Lung who traveled with the merchant captain Ran Ai Yu on her vessel the Jie Zuo to Faerûn in the mid-1360s DR. He was a crane Hengeyokai who usually disguised himself as a human.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He accompanied Ran Ai Yu when she arrived in Innarlith on the Lake of Steam in 1365 DR . There he met Ivar Devorast , a Cormyrean engineer tasked by the city-state with building a canal that would connect the Lake of Steam to the Nagaflow . Lau visited the canal site, and acted on behalf of the Shou merchant fleet to give his support for the endeavor. He met Phyrea , the daughter of Senator Inthelph at the site, and she tried to convince him that Devorast wasn't up to the task, although he claimed to have heard contrary reports about Devorast. He was interested in buying porcelain ships like the Jie Zuo from Ivar Devorast when he discovered that Devorast had been its builder, but he was shocked to discover that Devorast only built one and would never build another one.</p>
<p>He was present in Innarlith in 1374 DR when Ransar Pristoleph was fighting a civil war against a faction of senators who were seeking to overthrow him. He helped Pristoleph in the war, by defeating and capturing the Red Wizard , Marek Rymüt .</p>
