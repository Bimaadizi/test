<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Vaxall was a lesser agent of the Twisted Rune . Vaxall had many minions, among them its elite servants: the battle horror Gauntlet , the flameskull Skullpyr and the Doom Brigade , a company of ten Helmed horrors .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Vaxall was the most powerful beholder of the Alimir Hive outlander community, which was based out of the beholder city of Zokir . Its desire was to create a beholder nation on the surface consisting of the Arnaden region , Calimshan , eastern Tethyr and Erlkazar . In 1230 DR , Vaxall forged an alliance with Jhaniloth Puiral and, while becoming an elder orb , learned the secrets of magic from her. Since Jhaniloth's destruction in 1330 DR , Vaxall began work on a plan to make his desires come true.</p>
<p>It began by unifying some of the fractious eye tyrants of the Alimir Hive then, in the wake of the Time of Troubles , approached Teldorn Darkhope , polymorphed into the guise of a much younger beholder calling itself Xavlal . Xavlal offered Darkhope an alliance with a group of beholders that it claimed to represent and together, Xavlal and Darkhope seized power in the city of Mintar in 1362 DR .</p>
<p>The Knights of the Black Gauntlet , as they had come to be known, came to ally with the Zhentarim when Teldorn became a member. The Black Network already had a tradition of alliances with beholders so Vaxall retained his influence as long as he feigned allegiance to them.</p>
<p>In 1370 DR , the Knights conquered Kzelter but it was Vaxall who halted the Knights' advance at that city. It had discovered in the writings of the Oracle of the Deepwash, a reference to the " Sleeping Legion ", who could have been a threat to Vaxall's ambitions. Vaxall elected to try and destroy this force before they could get in its way.</p>
<p>Vaxall once possessed the Fanged Shield of Shyk Korort until it was stolen by Aldannar's Band . In an act of revenge for the theft, Vaxall annihilated the elven community in the Thornwood where two of that group's members hailed from.</p>
<p>Vaxall worked to refound the beholder cults of the Arnaden Region and placed agents in cities who spread disinformation about the weaknesses of beholders.</p>
