<p>Jatlo was a redcap servant of the green hag named Auntie Ethel in the city of Baldur's Gate in late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In his redcap form, Jatlo's appearance was similar to most other members of his fey race. When he took on the guise of a dragonborn , Jatlo appeared as a sinister-looking green-scaled dragon humanoid with no fins nor horns on his snake -like face.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Jatlo was ordered by his mistress to infiltrate the Anti-Hag Support Group formed by Auntie Ethel's victim – Mayrina . The redcap penned a letter to the support group asking to join them, creating a story of how his brother was a fellow victim of an evil hag. Jatlo claimed that his bother asked a hag for fame and wealth and was turned into a statue in his hometown's square with a plaque that read "'Toss a Coin for Luck." When Jatlo was allowed to join, he placed a curse on Mayrina using the hag's hex doll – a payback from Ethel. With Mayrina out of the picture, the redcap was trying to find a book that help the recipe for hag's bane – a concoction that could save the life of a child devoured by a hag.</p>
<p>It was unknown if Jatlo was successful or if he was found out and slain by the Absolute Adversaries , who themselves as a bone to pick with Auntie Ethel.</p>
