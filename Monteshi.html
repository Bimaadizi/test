<p>County Monteshi was a county in Tethyr . The ruined and haunted city of Shoonach resided there.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Together with Calimmon to its west, Monteshi made up the duchy of Ankaram and served as Tethyr's border with the kingdom of Calimshan to the south.</p>
<p>This county was a strange amalgam of rural pastureland and the dangerous ruins of ancient kingdoms. The site of Shoonach, the former capital of the Shoon Imperium , was here, and roughly half of the county's territory was disputed. Calimshan claimed that the region it called Monrativi Teshy Mir was rightfully theirs. The county contained a well-manned fortress, Fort Teqlar to guard against monster attacks from Shoonach or threats from Calimshan.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR , a pious hin , Count Oxsal Keeneyes ruled and defended Monteshi. Officially, his seat of power was the manor house of Pelmarin , but he spent the majority of his time at Fort Teqlar.</p>
