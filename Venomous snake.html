<p>Venomous snakes , often wrongly called poisonous snakes, were snakes no more than 7 ft (2.1 m) long with venom glands and hollow fangs who bit their prey, injecting various venoms into the preys bodies.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>All types of venomous snakes were ambush predators and would conceal themselves in foliage or underneath rocks, waiting for prey to amble near whereupon they would strike out and bite, injecting their venom into the target.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Venomous snakes could pose a danger in two different ways; The first was by having a strong venom that would induce sickness or even death in normal sized or larger targets. The other by slithering in swarms of up to 6 members and overwhelming their prey by the combined wight of their venomous bites. Of course the greatest danger was when they combined both and a swarm of snakes with deadly venom would work together to bring down even hardy foes.</p>
<h2>Species</h2>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Various venomous snakes were all over the place, from the Calim Desert in Calimshan , in the midwood of the Cormanthor forest, to the Umber Marshes near Thay .</p>
