<p>Fetchigrol was one of seven ancient liches who gave their life essence to create Crenshinibon , the Crystal Shard.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This incredibly powerful lich was originally a tribal shaman from another world. In order to become a lich, he sold each and every soul of the residents of his homeworld.</p>
<p>Fetchigrol's spirit essence was released with the fusing of Crenshinibon, Hephaestus , and Yharaskrik .</p>
<p>Fetchigrol was devoured by a shadow dragon . Fetchigrol was opening rifts through the planes in order to call forth hundreds of unnamed monsters. After making multiple tears in the fabric of the planes that connected the Prime Material Plane to the Shadowfell , a shadow dragon was drawn to the opening and tried to get through. The dragon, unable to fit its whole body through the opening, reached its head through and consumed Fetchigrol in a black cloud.</p>
