<p>Burnsalve was an alchemical ointment used to treat burns.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Applied to a burn, it minimized the impairments that the wound caused. Stronger versions also allowed burns to heal faster.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The substance could be made with herbal skills, but the stronger versions were difficult to synthesize, requiring a combination of solid alchemical and herbal skills, or exemplary skills in both areas for the strongest version. Hedge wizards often traded in it. It sold for about 300 gold pieces , with stronger salves calling for 350, and an even stronger salve going for 400.</p>
