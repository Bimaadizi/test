<p>Swordsman's belt were enchanted belts created by Vangerdahast Aeiulvana for the distinguished Purple Dragons of Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These were two types of these belts. Regular swordsman's belts and much more powerful greater swordsman's belts . Both types were enchanted to shield their wearers from slashing damage; however, the greater versions of swordsman's belts' enchantments were significantly more potent.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before King Azoun Obarskyr IV perished in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , he commissioned these belts from his Royal Magician Vangerdahast Aeiulvana to honor the most dedicated and venerated Purple Dragons of his realm. By 1372 DR , his reigning daughter Alusair Obarskyr continued the tradition, awarding swordsman's belts and sometimes even offering them to capable adventurers as an incentive to serve the Dragon Throne.</p>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR , there were quite a few of these enchanted belts scattered around the Sword Coast , found in Neverwinter 's various shops , and temples of Hillsfar .</p>
