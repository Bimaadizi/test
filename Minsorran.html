<p>Minsorran was a small theocratic realm on Lake Weng in Amn known as the Lands of Balance , founded during the time of the Shoon Imperium .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Minsorran was built on the shore of Lake Weng (then called the Lake of Amin) below the Cloud Peaks at an altitude of 1,500 feet (460 meters).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The region had long been part of the Calim Empire and its successors, but urban human settlement only arose in the centuries following 100 DR during which Athkatla , Crimmor , and Murann were founded.</p>
<p>Minsorran was founded in the Year of the Late Sun, 300 DR during the height of the Shoon Imperium by the followers of Selûne , Shar , Lathander , and Mystra . These faithful lived in harmony with each other and respected their collective pantheon as they built a theocracy in Minsor Vale and three other cities, in an uncommon practice that more resembled the religious governments of Unther and Mulhorand than that of western Faerûn .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Sage's Fervor, 347 DR , the emperor Shoon VII gave governorship of the region around the Lake of Amin to Thealnak of Memnon as a reward for creating the Codex Thealnakkar . This political development had little effect on the Lands of Balance.</p>
<p>Discontented Selûnites broke from Minsor Vale in the Year of the Half Moon, 390 DR and founded Myth Lharast hundreds of miles away, seeking to worship Selûne in a manner that involved fewer Sharrans.</p>
<p>The collapse of the surrounding Shoon Imperium and the rise of competing successor states in 450 DR had little effect on Minsorran.</p>
<p>Minsorran ceased to exist in the Year of Fire and Frost, 600 DR during a harsh midwinter blizzard when the entire population apparently vanished without a trace. The cause was actually the white dragon Icehauptannarthanyx , who laired in Mount Speartop and kept his existence secret. Among those that disappeared were the wife and eldest son of King Esmel Torlath II of Amn , who shortly after died of grief.</p>
<p>All four cities of the realm fell to ruin, though Minsor Vale was eventually resettled with a small village amid the larger ruins. The other three ruins remained uninhabited.</p>
