<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the band of adventurers led by Tessalynde Halendria came across a mysterious and dangerous Netherese spellbook called The Ruinous Child , they sought council with the scholars, sages, and the Avowed of Candlekeep. When the spellbook was opened by the group's mage , Cazrin Varaith , its dark magics affected all nearby enchanted books that were stored in the nearby library halls. The Busy Gardener's Illustrated Guide to Gentle Magical Enhancements was one of the books that possessed some magic, to the Avowed's surprise. Its enchantments went out of control and started spewing living vines as well as unleashing a shambling mound onto the library and its guests. Tessalynde's group managed to slay the shambler and close The Busy Gardener's Guide , stopping the chaos. Later, the group's bard , the tiefling named Lark Silverstring , penned a song about the kerfuffle he titled Terror in the Library .</p>
