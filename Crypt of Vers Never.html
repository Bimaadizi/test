<p>The Crypt of Vers Never was a tomb located in the Pauper's Section of Neverdeath Graveyard in Neverwinter . It was presumed to have been built for Vers Never , the ancestor of Lord Dagult Neverember .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The unassuming tomb was identified as the crypt of Vers Never around the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , by Retrigal Bookbinder , a scholar working to validate Lord Neverember's claim of descent from Nasher Alagondar . As Vers was known to have settled in Waterdeep , Retrigal presumed that the crypt would be empty, however he hoped that it might still contain something of interest (such as records of Vers Never's lineage). After identifying the crypt, Retrigal sought to enlist the help of an adventurer to neutralize any undead near it.</p>
