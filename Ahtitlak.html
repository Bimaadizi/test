<p>Ahtitlak was a village located in the Alpuk region of the Great Glacier .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Unlike most Ulutiun settlements, the residents of Ahtitlak did not live within minikitaks or snowhouses . In fact, the hardy villagers did not use any sort of structure to sleep in. Instead, they slept in the cavern around a large communal fire, using wolf-skins as bedding.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Ahtitlak was located in the south-eastern corner of Alpuk, entirely within a massive cavern along the western tip of the Lugsaas Chain . As of the late 15 th century DR , the giant kingdom of Kultaakarr had been founded nearby along the newly thawed Sea of Frozen Tears to the southeast.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 359 DR , the urit of a community in Nakvaligach received a kaiurit . The edict commanded the small village to migrate far to the south, where they were told a physical manifestation of Ulutiu would appear. When they arrived at their destination, they discovered a massive cavern inhabited by remorhazes. Since the villagers had never heard of or seen remorhazes before, they assumed the remorhazes were the physical manifestation of Ulutiu and decided to settle within the cavern.</p>
<p>The remorhazes began killing the villagers, decimating their population. Despite this, the villagers continued to offer food and water to the remorhazes, even protecting them from predators such as tirichik . Gradually, the remorhazes began to trust the villagers and a bond was formed, which held ever since.</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, the Glacier had continued its centuries-long retreat northward, freeing Ahtitlak from the ice for the first time.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The villagers of Ahtitlak were harsh and did not trust outsiders, even other Ulutiuns. They attacked anyone trespassing in their territory without mercy. They were unique among residents of the north, in that they had a peaceful and symbiotic relationship with the remorhaz , who shared their cavern with them.</p>
<p>The remorhazes treated the villagers as trusted companions, defending the village and its residents. The villagers provided food and water, treated any wounds a remorhaz received with a special poultice, and built fires to keep their eggs warm. The villagers developed a unique saddle made from leather that allowed them to ride the remorhazes, which allowed them to patrol their territory.</p>
