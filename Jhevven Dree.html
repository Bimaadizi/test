<p>Jhevven Dree was the author of one of the most important philosophical books about the exploration of the multiverse. He was from the island of Tharsult .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Dree was most famous for his popular work The Great Realms in the Stars , in which he wrote about the potential of other planes of existence and postulated that the divinity of the gods and goddesses was tied to the essence of these planes.</p>
<p>The vague descriptions of some of these "hypothetical" other worlds led many to suspect that Dree had actually traveled to some of them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dree wrote The Great Realms in the Stars in 1332 DR . An elderly Dree was still alive as late as the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR , and folk of that time—especially merchants, adventurers , and sages—eagerly hoped that he was working on another book.</p>
