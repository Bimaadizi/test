<p>The Churches Royal were the few religious organizations officially supported by the monarch of Cormyr or by members of their immediate family.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>Recorded Churches Royal included the Church of Tempus and Church of Tyr , which were supported by King Azoun Obarskyr IV .</p>
<p>The nomination of the Church of Chauntea as a Church Royal by Crown Princess Tanalasta Obarskyr moments before her death in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , created such an uproar that no churches were granted that privilege ever since.</p>
