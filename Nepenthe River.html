<p>The Nepenthe River was an underground body of water that flowed beneath a region of the Sword Coast , primarily the High Moor .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The source of the river was somewhere in the Misty Forest and was accessible by a cave therein. It flowed southeast, along a path underneath the southern border of the High Moor. The river culminated in a large, subterranean whirlpool that emptied into Kanaglym , within the Underdark .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The waters of the Nepenthe were extremely cold, to the point of nearly freezing. The air was equally cold and noticeably humid.</p>
<p>Along the path of the river, the surrounding caves were quite striking. The walls sparkled with veins of valuable minerals and incandescent mushrooms shone in a wide variety of colors.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the fall of Dragonspear Castle , in the Year of the Whelm, 1290 DR , the mage Ithtaerus Casalia stole a clutch of eggs away from Halatathlaer 's lair. He hid them away in a cavern on the banks of the Nepenthe.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Wyvern, 1363 DR , a group of adventurers rafted down the river in order to reach the labyrinth beneath Dragonspear Castle.</p>
<p>When the Shining Crusade took over Dragonspear Castle, around the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , they established a supply depot on the banks of the Nepenthe and used it as a means of transporting soldiers and resources. Among them was the mage Strunk of Silverymoon , who was binding the river's water elementals to his will.</p>
<p>Sometime before the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , a group of undead led by Born rose up from the Nepenthe and made their way into Dragonspear.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>The river passed directly under Dragonspear Castle. It was accessible through the castle's cellar, by means of the underground warrens.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>A number of creatures dwelled within the caves around the river, including sahuagin and ankhegs . The waters were home to a number of water elementals , a nereid , and even a particularly nasty morkoth called Sallissi .</p>
<p>During the midâ€“14 th century, the alchemist Bellowgulp Bluefingers and his myconid companion known as the Concoctor regularly traveled along the banks of the Nepenthe, selling their concoctions.</p>
