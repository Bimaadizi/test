<p>Briost Elthauryn was a magelord of Athalantar in the 3 rd century.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was quick-witted and calculating.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>His traps were famously clever.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He often acted as an envoy of the magelords in Athalantar and the lands around.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was the favourite of Ithboltar , who meant for him to replace king Belaur if it was ever needful.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He had an enchanted ring that he could trigger to promptly slay foes in combat, with no obvious display as to the nature of its attacks.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After Elmara slew Seldinor Stormcloak 's magelings in an inn west of Narthil , the Unicorn's Horn , Briost went out to avenge them, for Seldinor himself claimed to be "too busy". However, rather than going, he ultimately sent Gartos , a mercenary crowned Prince by King Belaur Aumar .</p>
<p>During the siege of Athalgard led by Prince Elminster Aumar on the Year of the Chosen, 240 DR , while in conference with his fellows, Briost recognized the face of Elminster, though he knew him only as a boy that he thought killed in Narthil. Shortly after, Briost was attacked by a number of Knights of Athalantar who crawled into his chambers through the garderobes. He managed to slay one with a magic ring, but was sworded through soon after. Ithboltar , a fellow magelord, tried to contact him, but failed to reach him, for he'd died.</p>
