<p>Volshur the Crooked was a priest of Ilmater , of the 3rd century DR , who held the title " Exalted Servant " and helped create the legendary sword Dornavver , the "Demonbane".</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>To counter the growing spread of evil under the Shoon Imperium and a plethora of evil artifacts fashioned at the time, the Church of Ilmater sought a weapon to combat such evil. To this end, the sword Dornavver was completed in the Year of the Wrath Sword, 275 DR . On the night of the Feast of the Moon that same year, Volshur, along with Archsufferer Irmakul "Bloodthews" , Revered Brother Filithan and other senior clergy of Ilmater, took the sword and gathered at Allyn's Anvil in the Alimir Mountains east of Calimshan . There they conducted a holy ritual in which their impassioned prayers and howls of suffering enchanted the sword. These events were documented in the tome Relics of the Righteous .</p>
