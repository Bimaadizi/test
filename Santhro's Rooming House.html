<p>The Temple of Garagos was a place of worship dedicated to Garagos in the city of Bezantur , Thay , that also served as an inn known as Santhro's Rooming House in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple was located just inside the western wall of Bezantur—the so-called "City of a Thousand Temples"—just north of the city's west gate . This gate made the temple convenient to caravans arriving in town from Thasselen and Thay's coastal cities.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The temple was located inside a rundown tenement building.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>As an inn, rooms could be rented from the Temple for one gold piece per month. Meals were only served to customers who asked nicely.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As a place of worship, the Temple catered to a small group of Garagos's faithful. Despite the congregation being small, they were enthusiastic about their god.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , the Temple of Garagos was one of only a few temples remaining to the god in all of Faerûn (once worshiped throughout the Inner Sea ), and even within the City of a Thousand Temples, the Reaver was not a popular god as he was widely believed to have been killed by Tempus . This forced High Priest Santhro to fight against these perceptions, and ultimately to convert the temple into a boarding house in order to make some money.</p>
