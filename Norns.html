<p>The Norns were a group of goddesses of fate in the Norse pantheon . While not directly worshiped on Toril , legends of the Norns and their destiny-spinning powers were common in the Realms .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>In either Asgard or the Outlands , the Norns could be found beneath one of Yggdrasil 's roots in their own divine realm , known as the the Well of Urd ,</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>All the Norns had some degree of magic resistance , could only be harmed by enchanted weapons, had the power to assume any form they wished, and were said to see all things throughout time — the past, present, and future. Consequently, they could tell whenever someone was lying to them and were revolted by such attempts to deceive.</p>
<p>The members of the Norns often fought with enchanted daggers .</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The three primary members of the Norns were known as Urd, Verdandi, and Skuld. Respectively they were, in their true forms, a giantess , an elf , and a dwarf . The three of them were believed to represent the past, present, and future.</p>
<p>Beyond those three, there were many other Norns of lesser rank, some of whom resembled elves and dwarves. Some in Sigil believed that Black Marian , a mysterious priestess who lived in that city, was one of these Norns.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Norns tended to Yggdrasil, undoing the harm wrought by Nidhoggr constantly chewing at its roots, and often advised the deities of the Norse pantheon on special situations.</p>
<p>Both mortals and deities sought them out at the Well of Urd to have their fortunes foretold, but they were largely unwilling to reveal such things unless they dealt with themselves. Though they were willing to answer questions of slight import, sometimes for large fees.</p>
<h3>Rumored Activities</h3>
<p>Many of the other activities of the Norns were surrounded in myths. The Asgardians believed that the Norns marked out their fate, or wyrd as they called it, at the moment of their birth. Some went so far as to claim that they shaped the destinies of all sentient creatures throughout the multiverse , traveling throughout the Prime Material plane in the form of swans to deal out each person's fate in the form of prophecy.</p>
<p>The Asgardians believed that the primary Norns would arrive disguised as some combination of three animals at a child's birth. They also believed that if the parents recognized the Norns and offered all three great gifts, such as items made of gold and silver , they would be willing to reveal the newborn's fate.</p>
<p>Others believed that doing so would persuade the Norns to dictate a great future for the child. But if gifts of equal value weren't given, or the parents had unknowingly offered one of the gifts to a mundane animal, it was believed one of the Norns would become offended and turn the gifts of her peers into a curse . Though others dismissed this notion of persuading for a better fate, as they believed there was no force that could alter their decision of a being's decreed fate.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point the primary Norns foresaw that a member of the Norse pantheon, Hod the Blind , would one day slay the deity Baldur with a spear of mistletoe . As a result of their prophesy, Hod was exiled from Asgard.</p>
<p>Some centuries prior to the Time of Troubles , in the kingdom of Bakar , a survivor state of the Imaskar Empire , a mighty city known as Medinat Muskawoon housed temples to gods of faiths that the populace's ancestors brought over from their original worlds. Among these temples was one dedicated to Balder, known simply as the Temple of Balder , and inn front of it stood a semi-circle of stones, a shrine dedicated to the Norns. It was magically warded to keep out all wooden objects, especially mistletoe, and was meant to act as protection for Balder against fate and all who would seek to do him harm.</p>
<p>When a group of adventurers explored the ruins of Medinat Muskawoon in the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR , the Norns appeared before them at their shrine and asked the adventurers a set of three questions – "What is your family?", "What do you seek in this city?", and "What do you wish from us?" The adventurers answered them swiftly and truthfully, confessing that they were there in search of the Star of Mo-Pelar . Satisfied, the Norns provided them information and allowed them to pass.</p>
<p>At some point Breidablik , the divine hall of Baldur, suffered three terrible omens that were thought to be the work of the Norns. These included ravens roosting in the eaves of the hall, a fensir raiding the hall and kidnapping one of its brewmistresses, and about a thousand Breidablik's wine barrels suddenly going sour and turning into vinegar . Baldur's petitioners became worried that it was only a matter of time before a raiding party came to their doorstep, demanding a sacrifice for the Norns, and rumors began to circulate that a lottery might be held to determine who would be given up for such a task.</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>The Norns were largely not known to be worshiped on the Prime Material and had no favored servants. The Outer Planes faction known as the Fated worshiped them within their headquarters Rowan's Hall , which was located near the Well of Urd. And they were worshiped alongside Odin in the gate-town of Glorium .</p>
<p>Sometimes groups gathered in prayer to the Norns when they sought aid in obtaining hidden knowledge.</p>
