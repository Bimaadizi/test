<h3>Orders</h3>
<h3>Rituals</h3>
<p>On the 13 th day of each month, the Forgotten Folk held the Communion of Laughter in his honor. It consisted of joke-telling contests, communal meals, dancing, prayers, and storytelling, and donations of gold , which Garl's church used to the benefit of the entire community.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to legend, Garl Glittergold was exploring underground when he found a new cavern, and inside, a new people—the gnomes. He told them a joke and then led them out into the wider world.</p>
