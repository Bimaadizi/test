<p>A darkskull was a powerful magical item that was wholly evil in nature.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They were carved entirely out of a single piece of ebony .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A darkskull emanated unholy energy and tainted everything within its vicinity. This effect extended outwards to a radius of 40 ft (12 m).</p>
<p>It was possible for a darkskull to be 'redeemed'. Upon this occurrence, silver holy symbols would appear upon its surface, and the 80‑foot-wide (24‑meter) area around the skull would be marked as hallowed ground .</p>
