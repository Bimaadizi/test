<p>The Po Yul Dzayul Range was a mountain range in Tabot in Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Po Yul Dzayul Range was the middle of the three arms of the Yehimal that extended east into Kara-Tur. It bisected the high plateau of Tabot. Branching off from the south side was the Haraki Ridge .</p>
<h2>Locations</h2>
<p>Two significant mountains in the Po Yul Dzayul Range were Mount Shun and Mount E'kwong .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Po Yul Dzayul Range appeared black from a distance, and peaks forbidding. Mount Shun was craggy and described as "mysterious", while Mount E'kwong was jagged, foreboding, and grim. High altitudes and the prevailing winds kept the glaciers frozen.</p>
<h2>Legends</h2>
<p>By 1357 DR , a blind beggar in the city of Rokstang , Tabot, was telling a tale of how he and some companions once ventured into the Po Yul Dzayul Range and discovered a lost mine stuffed with diamonds and other gems . However, the explorers were attacked by a wrathful spirit that slew all but the beggar. Left blinded by the spirit (or perhaps by the sun), he wandered lost on a glacier for days until he was discovered and taken to Rokstang, where he survived as a beggar.</p>
