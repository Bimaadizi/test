<p>Warrior's Rest , also known as Knight's Rest , was a divine realm in Limbo according to the Great Wheel cosmology and a Neutral Plane in the World Tree cosmology of Toril . With perhaps the most misleading title in the whole cosmology, the theme of Warrior's Rest was battle, and each petitioner had no constant loyalty to a deity. When a petitioner was slain in combat during one of the endless chaotic battles, he or she would rise again on the team that brought him or her down.</p>
<p>The terrain of Warrior's Rest was similar to rocky badlands on the Prime Material plane . The nearby terrain could be manipulated by the will of those with sufficient wisdom to provide cover and other tactical advantages for battle.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Many titans were native to Warrior's Rest, and they joined in the ongoing battle with joy. Also, githzerai built a fortress and several monasteries amid the chaotic battles.</p>
<h2>Petitioners</h2>
<p>The petitioners of Warrior's rest included soldiers, generals, strategists, barbarians , and many other combat oriented individuals. They appeared as they did in the prime of their lives and in the peak of their physical shape, glowing with health. All sought union with their deity through participation in the great wars, and so were granted extraordinary resilience to acid , fire , cold, and electricity damage, as well as regenerative powers.</p>
<h2>Deities</h2>
<h2>Access to Warrior's Rest</h2>
<p>There were no known portals to or from Warrior's Rest.</p>
