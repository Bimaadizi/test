<p>The Stirge was a drakkar pirate vessel operating on the Sea of Fallen Stars in 1359 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The ship had a crew of thirty pirates and sixty slaves used as oarsmen. A single fire projector was used when combating other vessels.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Stirge was sworn to the service of the pirate Vurgrom , who sent it out in 1359 DR alongside the Wind's Slave and two other ships to raid Teziir . They managed to capture the merchant Mulnis Lenz and a special treasure he carried, to be delivered from Waterdeep to Azoun Obarskyr IV . Unbeknownst to the Stirge , the Wind's Slave had been captured during the raid and sent after it, with the two ships meeting in battle again shortly afterwards.</p>
