<p>The Rivington General was a smithy shop that produced quality weapons and armor , made by Gyldro Angleiron , its master smith and proprietor in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Rivington General stood on the Coast Way in Rivington, just south across the road from the Open Hand Temple .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The smithy and the shop were two connected buildings. The shop was used exclusively by the customers and run by a clerk, while the smithy, to the south, was Gyldro's home. Customers were not welcome in the workshop.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Master Gyldro Angleiron purchased Rivington General from its previous owner, old Gossoon , sometime in or shortly before the Year of the Purloined Statue, 1477 DR .</p>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Master Angleiron started seeing weapons forged out of infernal iron appearing in the city of Baldur's Gate. Once, a scimitar made of this exotic metal was brought to the Rivington General by a Rivington Rats gang member. That was the third item of the kind. The smith swiftly sold the weapons on to get them out of his shop, believing that these diabolic items would bring nothing but trouble. He, however, wondered where the infernal iron was coming from all of a sudden. The same year, Gyldro was attacked and knocked out by one of the True Soul heroes of Baldur's Gate. In reality, it was a shapeshifting Chosen of Bhaal , Orin the Red . She briefly impersonated Master Gyldro Angleiron to taunt the True Soul heroes, only to subsequently abduct and murder the man, leaving store clerk and aspiring smith Exxvikyap managing the shop by herself.</p>
