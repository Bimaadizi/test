<p>Elixirs of arcane cultivation were potions that temporarily expanded the imbiber's mind, allowing them to temporarily hold more arcane or divine magic.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These concoctions were typically bottled in crude vials decorated with a string of various fetishes, feathers, bones, and beads.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When consumed, the elixir gave the imbibers an expanded state of mind, allowing them to cast one additional arcane spell or a divine prayer. The potion's effects dissipated after the drinker took a rest of at least eight hours or if they consumed another long-acting magical concoction. More powerful versions of these potions existed, simply called greater elixirs of arcane cultivation .</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>An elixir of arcane cultivation could be created using a special type of alchemical sublimate and a foul-slamming paste – vitriol of weavemoss . A more powerful variety of the potion was created from suspension of laculite and a certain type of alchemical vitriol.</p>
