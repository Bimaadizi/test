<p>The sang kauw ( pronounced : / s ɒn g k aʊ / song-cow ) was a weapon unique to the continent of Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The sang kauw was available in two distinct forms. The primary form consisted of a double-headed spear 3​ to ​5 feet (0.91​ to ​1.5 meters) in length with a loop handle positioned at the center, featuring a dagger or crescent extending from it. This version required one hand for effective parrying and attacking. The alternate form closely resembled the first, except for the inclusion of a small buckler fitted in the center, from which the dagger blade projected. Regardless of the chosen form, mastering the use of the sang kauw demanded extensive training for optimal effectiveness.</p>
