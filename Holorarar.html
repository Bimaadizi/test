<p>Holorarar was one of the eight subkingdoms of the dwarven realm of Shanatar . It was the final kingdom to be founded by the dwarves of Shanatar.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Holorarar was located beneath the Clovis Fields , within the surface realm of Tethyr . It was located roughly in the middle of Deep Shanatar. Most of the realms inhabitants lived in a single massive cavern that was home to a large shallow lake.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Within Holorarar, members of nearly every clan of Shanatar made their home, building their houses in a large ring on the cavern walls. Immigration, and the new ideas that came with it, were welcome in the kingdom. As a result, the population of Holorarar grew so rapidly that many dwarves later moved to High Shanatar. After it was abandoned by the shield dwarves , the ruined kingdom was occupied by several tribes of hobgoblins , who previously dwelt in the surrounding Underdark. They lived in a state of constant intercine warfare for centuries.</p>
<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>Holorarar was the breadbasket of Shanatar and was a wealthy trading hub. It was home to rich fields of golden kelp and lush growths of mushrooms .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Holorarar, like the rest of Shanatar, fell during the Kin Clashes in −1800 DR . The invading duergar employed slash-and-burn tactics, devastating the lush farms and fields of the realm. As of 1372 DR , the fallen kingdom was now the home to a kingdom of the same name, inhabitated by numerous tribes of thousands of hobgoblins and other goblinoids . After centuries of inter-tribal warfare, in −379 DR , the hobgoblins finally united as a single nation under a king. It has since grown in population and military strenght. The tribes still feuded with each other but every once in a while united as a single force to conduct massive raids on the surface realms of Calimshan and Tethyr.</p>
