<p>Cendriane was an old eladrin city that existed in both Faerûn and in the Feywild .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>In the Feywild, Cendriane was located in the center of a dark forest. In Faerûn, Cendriane was located beside a mountain range, near an orc village.</p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>Cendriane was the biggest and most beautiful city of the eladrin, made of crystal spires.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Cendriane was one of the oldest cities founded by the eladrin in the Feywild. The city was built to allow it to exist in both Faerûn and the Feywild simultaneously.</p>
<p>Cendriane was the site of one of the most vicious battles between the eladrin and the drow , a battle that ultimately destroyed the city. At the height of Cendriane’s might and glory, the Witch of Fates appeared clad in the black of mourning to speak a dreadful prophecy against the city. It was said that the dreaded Zhudun was the brightest star in the sky the night Cendriane fell.</p>
<p>The city was abandoned shortly thereafter, except for its ruler, the eladrin vampire lord Kannoth. Not long after, the part of the city existing in Faerûn fell to ruin as well.</p>
<p>Sometime after the Spellplague , the shiere knight eladrin Astriana recruited the half-orc druid Haggar to seal the Living Gate .</p>
