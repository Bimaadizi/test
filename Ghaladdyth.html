<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , while Ghaladdyth was supporting in a mission to dispose of Halonder Eldeglut and his wife by getting them unconscious and sending them to Chult while drow supplanted them, they discovered that one of their own infiltrators had been replaced by a different drow, Qilu√© Veladorn . After she was subdued and a warrior was mind-broken by trying to mind ream her, the drow sorceress Daerdatha, also part of the infiltration team, called on several of those present to link their minds to hers so as to better be able to withstand the intensity of the counter-infiltrator's mind.</p>
