<p>Faroul ( pronounced : / f ɑː ˈ r uː l / fah-ROOL ) was a human fortune hunter working as a jungle guide out of Port Nyanzaru , Chult in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Faroul was of Calishite descent. He stood at 5 feet and 10 inches (180 centimeters) tall and weighed 175 pounds (79.4 kilograms). He carried a shortsword .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Coming from a rich family, Faroul was pompous, spoiled, overconfident in his own business acumen, and a dandy. He was accustomed to carousing and to freely spending money, and fancied himself an adventure-seeker. While he liked to tell stories about his prowess in combat, he was ultimately quite incompetent as both a guide and as a fighter, and would only draw his sword in emergencies.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Faroul's relationship with his wealthy family was strained, and they had sent him away to Port Nyanzaru to earn his own fortune after becoming fed up with his antics.</p>
<p>His good friend, drinking companion, and partner as a jungle guide was Gondolo . The pair owned a flatulent triceratops named Zongo , whom they had purchased to participate in Port Nyanzaru's dinosaur races before discovering that it was hopelessly slow and only good for serving as a pack animal.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Faroul was sent away to Port Nyanzaru by his parents, he was joined on the journey by Gondolo. Flush with Faroul's gold , they anticipated an easy life of partying, adventure, and making money. Within a few months, their lives of debauchery and gambling (especially at the dinosaur races) had left them not only broke, but in debt to several different bookies and more than one merchant prince .</p>
<p>Despite their haplessness, the pair then became jungle guides (thus working for the merchant prince Jobal ), offering "two guides for the price of one" at a rate of 5 gold pieces per day with 30 days paid up front.</p>
<p>Out of desperation, Gondolo purchased a treasure map that showed the location of Needle's Bones , then sought to find a group of adventurers who would hire them as guides to "ancient sites and sacred places" where "treasure abounds". They asked for an equal share of any treasure from such an outing in exhange for a discount on their guide fees.</p>
