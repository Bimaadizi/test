<p>The Singing Caverns was a jungle cave system located east of the town of Rassatan in Samarach .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The Singing Caverns were thought to be artificially created sometime in the long-forgotten past, or at least that was what drunkards at the Forgotten Pearl claimed. The caves did not appear to run too deep and were filled with luminescent cave vegetation and all manner of mushrooms. The main inhabitants of the alluring musical cave were rare giant green spiders and bats .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , an adventuring performer named Redfeyer was told of a mysterious and beautiful cave just east of Rassatan. The cavern allegedly held a treasure deep within a nest of giant spiders that lived there. Redfeyer traveled along the Sanrach Mountains but found the caverns filled with hungry arachnids and angry bats. With Beshaba 's ill-luck, Redfeyer's singing pendant sprang to life, harmonizing with the cavern's ghostly singing. The conspicuous performance attracted every hungry beast in the cave, and Redfeyer was forced to flee, losing the magic necklace in the process.</p>
<p>Saddened by his loss, Redfeyer was searching for a band of adventurers to venture into the Singing Cave and retrieve the singing pendant , with the rumored treasure inside being the reward.</p>
