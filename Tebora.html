<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1374 DR , Tebora was the one answering the questions of Ususi Manaallin and Iahn Qoyllor , who had entered the shop while disguised as Lady Urale and her manservant Alon (Iahn being the manservant). During her conversation, either Shaddon Datharathi or Pandorym looked out of Tebora's body without her notice or knowledge. She offered to wrestle "Alon" to demonstrate the power of her plangent prosthetics; his disguise broke in the violence, and he was forced to knock her out in order to keep their presence a secret.</p>
