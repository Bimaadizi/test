<p>The Whipwalker's Cloak was a tavern located in the city of Zhentil Keep during the mid-14 th century DR before that city's destruction.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Whipwalker's Cloak was appropriately located along Pain Street in the Common Quarter of western Zhentil Keep.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Given its close proximity to the Tower of Pain Exalted , a temple dedicated to Loviatar , many of the patrons within the Whipwalker's Cloak were worshipers of the Maiden of Pain. Any miscreants causing trouble within the tavern were usually granted at least a dozen lashes by Loviatar's faithful before being thrown out onto the street to serve as a warning to others.</p>
