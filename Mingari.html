<p>Mingari was a rare and exotic spice exported from Ulgarth around 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Description & Uses</h2>
<p>This strong spice was similar to cinnamon in flavor. When blended with fruit from Maztica , delicious ketjap was created. It needed to be blended, and was typically stored and sold in jars.</p>
<h2>Sources</h2>
<p>Mingari was farmed in eastern Ulgarth, particularly around Kaspar and east of Kelazzan . It was traded through Orvyltar to Durpar , where the Karakil chaka in Morvar had a primary interest in the mingari trade. The Durpari shipped the mingari across the Shining South .</p>
<p>Throughout all of Toril , mingari was only grown and blended in Ulgarth, who only traded it to Durpar, giving those countries a nice monopoly on the supply of the favored spice, which was just being discovered by wider Faer√ªn around 1367 DR . It was Ulgarth's primary export.</p>
