<p>A lifter was a magical transportation device used by beholders to move people and cargo.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The lifter was a large disk-shaped platform up to 12 feet (3.7 meters) across, enchanted with a basic autonomous levitation effect. They were often heavily decorated with ornamental inlays and enameled designs of popular beholder artistic subjects, such as beholder eyeballs.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A lifter would float in place by default and could be programmed with a pre-set weight limit, whereupon it would begin gradually changing altitude. It would stop when a rider spoke the command word , or it came within 6 feet (1.8 meters) of a ceiling. Lifters were often placed in vertical tunnels that were only a few inches wider than the disk, in order to be used as elevators.</p>
