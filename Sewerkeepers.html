<p>The Sewerkeepers was a criminal organization, part of the Guild , that operated under the cover identity of the sewer maintenance worker druids of the Sewer Keep in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Sewerkeepers took over the Sewer Keep, financed by the patriars of the Gate, erected in the Seatower neighborhood. The Keep's function was to treat and purify the city's sewage before it was released into the River Chionthar . The public's refusal to finance the sewage purifying eventually led to the project's collapse. What was left of the Keep was taken over by the Sewerkeepers crew under the leadership of Kingpin Genamine Kopali . The so-called druids and technicians of the Keep were disguised thieves who used the Keep's pipes and sewers for their illicit activities, burglaries, smuggling, and occasionally, monster-hunts.</p>
<p>Despite being a criminal organization, the Sewerkeepers did employ several actual druids who kept the Keep running, using shambling mounds to purify the sewage and trained beasts to be used as guards.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During Genamine Kopali's rule, the Sewerkeepers were paid by Mortlock Vanthampur , a member of the patriar Vanthampur family, to inform him of the strange happenings under the city. During the Absolute crisis of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the newly-risen Kingpin named Stone Lord , started a guild war against the Guild, strategically taking out the Guild's agents, kingpins, and taking over their territory. The Stone Lord was a thrall of the Cult of the Absolute , and as a part of the guild war, his men torched the Sewerkeepers's base, killing its members and Genamine Kopali herself; however, the Guild failed to recover the dead Kingpin's body.</p>
