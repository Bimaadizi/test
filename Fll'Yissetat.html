<p>Fll'Yissetat was a fairly powerful female green dragon who acted as an unwilling guardian for Abazigal 's lair, having been geased into service. The key to unlocking the geas was a scroll of reversal kept in the desk of Iycanth .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The green dragon owned Abazigal's wardstone and an enchanted trinket called The Specter's Ring .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gorion's Ward reached the dragon's chamber, and noticed that within her eyes, was a great suffering, as if she was in unfathomable pain. Fll'Yissetat recognised the ward as a Bhaalspawn , and asked to be freed. In order to reach Abazigal, had to either release Fll'Yissetat, in which case she left, or fight her. Either way, she wished for the ward to kill the "mongrel half-breed" that kept her geased for so long.</p>
