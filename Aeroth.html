<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before becoming the leader of the cult's cell in Karthaut Lighthouse , Aeroth was a member of a cell in Vaasa that was disrupted by a group of paladins , causing him to flee, resurfacing at a later date in another cell, within Cormyr . After that cell failed because of divided loyalties, Aeroth joined with Reveilaein, becoming the Wearer of Purple for his new cell. The cell moved to the Dragon Coast , where after capturing a lighthouse, they sought to tempt lesser dragons into becoming dracoliches. About a month after they began operations, Teziir may have sent adventurers to check up on the lighthouse workers.</p>
