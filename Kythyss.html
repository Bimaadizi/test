The natives of Kythyss decided to hire mercenaries to protect them, but those mercenaries were bribed by the Amnian occupiers of nearby Snowdown to serve the needs of Viceroy Erliza Daressin of Westphal . As of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the city had been infiltrated by these Amnian mercenaries, aided by traitors. Soon, Kythyss was being ruled by these mercenaries, and any citizens who did not profess loyalty to Amn kept quiet or else risked the deaths of themselves and their families.</p>
