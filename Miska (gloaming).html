<h2>Abilities</h2>

<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Among Miska's possessions were a pair of bracers of armor , a ring of protection , a cloak of charisma , a magical dagger , a pearl of power , and a wand of baleful polymorph . He also carried potions of gaseous form and cure moderate wounds .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Despite his tendency toward transience, Miska was a valued member of the Underdark Anarchists' Fellowship. The organization's leader, Marlowe Rodan , did not think Miska had the devotion necessary to remain with the cause for long. Still, as of the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Miska had been a member of the Fellowship for three years, due in large part to enjoying the tasks entrusted to him which kept him from boredom.</p>
<p>Along with other senior members of the Anarchists' Fellowship, Miska undertook missions to recruit new members and facilitate plans and stratagems.</p>
<p>Miska believed Marlowe was grooming him for command of the Fellowship one day. While this probably was not the case, the prospect of leadership both enticed and frightened Miska.</p>
