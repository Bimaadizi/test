<p>The Twin Visages were located on the north coast of Payit . The 'visages' were a pair of faces (one of a man, the other a woman) carved into the cliffside on either side of the ocean harbor where the god Qotal set sail from. Both faced east, supposedly watching for Qotal's return. On top of the cliff stood a crumbling pyramid.</p>
