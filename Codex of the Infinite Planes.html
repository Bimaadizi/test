<p>Codex of the Infinite Planes , also known as Yagrax's Tome , was a cursed artifact that held terrible power.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Codex was far larger than a tome should be. A pair of strong men could barely lift the tome. Deep black obsidian was used for the covers. The pages were sheets of hammered lead thin enough to fold like paper . Every page was illuminated with bizarre markings in an unknown language. The reader always found another page no matter how many times the pages of the Codex were turned.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Every power within the Codex was triggered by reading. The Codex was capable of opening a portal to any plane of existence or any location on a Prime Material plane . The Codex could summon a greater fiend to serve the reader for a full day.</p>
<p>Each use of the Codex posed a cumulative risk of driving the reader utterly insane, unleashing a catastrophic event, or inadvertently summoning a greater tanar'ri .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The origins of the Codex of the Infinite Planes remained unknown.</p>
<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
<p>Emirikol , a plane -traveling wizard , had possession of the Codex of the Infinite Planes at one point.</p>
