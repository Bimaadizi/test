<p>The Mud Pits of Florrb were a set of three pits of mudÂ on the Snout of Omgar overseen by a mud mephit named Florrb .</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , the tortles of Ahoyhoy liked to come to the mud pits to bathe and relax. They conversed with Florrb in Aquan .</p>
<h2>Planar Portal</h2>
<p>Each of the pools was a planar portal to the Elemental Plane of Earth . To be activated, the pools had to be exposed to an open flame, signifying all four elements: air and fire for the open flame, and water and earth for the mud. Once activated, a creature needed only to submerge themselves in the mud to be transported. A creature on the Elemental Plane of Earth did not need an open flame to travel to the material plane .</p>
