<p>The High Road , also known as the King's High Road or the High , connected the trade town of Easting with the kingdom of Cormyr . It led from Easting to Proskur , over the Bridge of Fallen Men into the Storm Horn Mountains , through the hamlet of Old Axe and under Skull Crag then through Eagle Peak before coming to High Horn . It then continued east out of the mountains, going through Tyrluk and Eveningstar (where it connected with the Starwater Road ), crossed the Starwater River via a stone bridge and finally ended at the west gate of Arabel .</p>
