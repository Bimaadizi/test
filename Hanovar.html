<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hanovar was one of the renegades living in the human quarter of Nexal in 1362 DR . That year, after Millos , the barkeep of The Death's Head bar, was sacrificed to Zaltec , Hanovar took control of the bar.</p>
<p>Afterward, he spoke with Ironspike , a former acquaintance of Millos, and an adventuring party hired by Drakosa to find the Cloak of One Plume for the right price. However, soon after, a patrol of Viperhands orcs entered the bar with the intent to kill all people present.</p>
