<p>A ghost lantern was a magical lantern that held a restless spirit , granting it a variety of powers.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The spirit trapped inside the lantern could be ordered by the lantern's owner to shed light. It could also be commanded to perform an activity remotely, effectively emulating the mage hand spell. Finally, the spirit magically stabilized an owner that fell unconscious within a distance of 10 feet (3 meters) from the lantern.</p>
<p>While the spirit remained trapped in the lantern, it could not be harmed or returned to its body as per the raise dead spell. However, it could be released from the lantern and into the afterlife if someone cast dispel evil and good , which also rendered the lantern itself nonmagical.</p>
