<p>The Small Teeth were a small mountain range that made up the border between Amn to the north and Muranndin to the south.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Small Teeth were a relatively small cluster of mountains. The average peak height was 8,000 feet above sea level. They were lightly forested, except for on the tallest peaks.</p>
<p>The southern foothills were a good area for growing grapes .</p>
<p>A large amount of snow fell in the mountains. The melts from these snows form the Imnestream and the River Specie , which flow through the Zehoarast Floodplains and into the sea.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The mountains were home to the blue dragon Iryklathagra . The lair of a mated pair of bronze dragons once resided in the Teeth as well, but they were driven away or slain by Iryklathagra in 1369 DR . The surviving mate, Arellaxerrontoal , plotted her revenge from the Forest of Tethir .</p>
<p>In 1095 DR , the Skeletal Finger maintained several hideouts in the mountains.</p>
<p>Historically, the Teeth were home to hill giants . By 1370 DR , in a vast underground network of caves and tunnels within the Small Teeth, the Sythillisian Empire thrived, ruled by two ogre magi and their vast army of goblinoids , ogres , kobolds , and remaining hill giants.</p>
<h2>Trails and Byways</h2>
<p>The Small Teeth had twisting trails that often confused travels. On top of this problem was the danger from the humanoid monsters in the region.</p>
<p>The Imnescourse Trail was one such trail. It led from Imnescar to Gambiton . The Trade Way also passed through the mountains on its northerly journey.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 479 DR , Prince Imnel Torlath led an army against the ogres of the Small Teeth, clearing the passes. A major battle was fought at a location known as Imnel's Scar, which later became the site of the city of Imnescar.</p>
<p>During the Shoon Empire , the city of Xandar served as a second capital for Tethyr, which was a vassal state of the Empire at that time. The entire city was destroyed when a volcano erupted underneath it in 260 DR .</p>
<p>In the month of Eleasis in 1370 DR , the two ogre magi led their army of the "Sythillisian Empire" out from the tunnels in the Small Teeth to attack the port city of Murann . By 1372 DR , they were successful. The region they conquered would later become the kingdom of Muranndin.</p>
