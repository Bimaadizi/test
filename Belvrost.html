<p>The Belvrost clan was a magically powerful family of Reddansyr on the Dragon Coast known in the late 14 th century DR</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Belvrosts were mostly burly, with brown hair and eyes on faces described as bearlike and friendly. However, some female members of their blood instead grew slender, with green eyes and red hair. Almost all of them had the spark for the Art .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The clan was based out of Reddansyr, where its members had largely numbered root-crop farmers and masons. They also owned some of the local inns. During his reign as the Magister from 1322 DR to 1328 DR , Maxiladanarr Torstren arranged for marriages in this clan that would produce more mages.</p>
<p>By 1370 DR , the best known Belvrosts were Chasler Belvrost and Telgerd Belvrost .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The clan had outposts in Baernwood , Redwater , and Nathlekh . They numbered maybe two hundred mages of some skill, twenty of them being quite worthy of the title of a wizard. The patriarch and matriarch, Maelaeve Belvrost and Arildan Belvrost , lived in the manor of Sundstone in Baernwood by 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>One or two Belvrosts every generation could "read items", perceiving mental scenes of the past events or owners of those items by touch, and the ability to send and receive mental missives in a manner akin to sending . All Belvrosts had the ability to respond to such a sending .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Belvrosts were largely considered trustworthy, if a bit strange. They themselves believed Mystra had created them for a purpose yet unknown, and liked to pass down legends of their magically powerful members, such as Narvar Belvrost and Halbadan Belvrost .</p>
