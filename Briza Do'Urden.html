<p>Briza Do'Urden was the eldest and most powerful of the daughters of Matron Mother Malice Do'Urden of House Do'Urden of Menzoberranzan .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Briza was large by drow standards and had a round figure.</p>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She had two younger sisters, Vierna Do'Urden , who outlived her, and Maya Do'Urden , who did not.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Briza was born to Malice Do'Urden in Year of the Palace, 918 DR when Malice was 100 years old. Malice used Briza's birth and the proscribed technique of Birthing magic to murder her own mother, Vartha Do'Urden , and become Matron Mother of her house. Although told that her father was Rizzen Do'Urden , her true father was Uthegentel Del'Armgo of House Barrison Del'Armgo , a fact that was suspected by few, and known by even fewer.</p>
<p>Briza became a high priestess of Lolth shortly before House Do'Urden's attack on House De Vir in 1297 DR .</p>
<p>When Briza found her rogue brother, Drizzt Do'Urden , deep in the Underdark , he cut off some of her fingers. The only reason she did not die was because Drizzt's panther Guenhwyvar leapt on him at the last moment, reminding him of his vow made after killing Masoj Hun'ett and Alton De Vir not to kill another drow again.</p>
<p>In 1339 DR , Briza killed her mother after she failed to kill Drizzt with Zin-carla . However, at that precise moment, House Baenre began attacking House Do'Urden. Thus Briza was matron mother for a very brief period before her death.</p>
