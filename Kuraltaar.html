<p>Kuraltaar was a diamond shield relying on the power of a bound glabrezu to provide great power to its bearer.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kuraltaar was forged from an alloy of silver with arjale and tantulhor , two rare ores found in the Nine Hells , in its case the fiery layer of Phlegethos . This gave it a silvery appearance with a greenish hue, and caused it to be extremely resistant to physical attacks while retaining a level of flexibility.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This magical shield had the ability to impart its bearer with great magical and elemental resistances akin to those of the fiend bound within, including immunity to poison and electricity.</p>
<p>Whenever the special protections provided by Kuraltaar were used, the image of a powerful and muscular glabrezu would cover the user.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kuraltaar was one of thirteen demonshields created by Halaster Blackcloak for the Shoon Imperium between the Year of the Addled Arcanist, 128 DR and the Year of Thirteen Prides Lost, 132 DR . The process of its creation included the binding of Kural'Risyk , a powerful glabrezu.</p>
<p>While the other shields were distributed amongst high-ranking members of the empires, Kuraltaar was stored in the vaults of the imperium. During the Year of Emerald Eyes, 371 DR , Kuraltaar was offered by the Qysara Shaani to the blue dragon Iryklathagra in an attempt to bargain for peace.</p>
