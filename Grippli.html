<p>Grippli ( sing & pl ) were a race of intelligent amphibian humanoids.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Short and dexterous, grippli resembled bipedal tree frogs. Swamp-dwelling grippli typically had gray-green skin, often mottled with darker colors such as green and brown. Grippli who dwelled in rainforests displayed a wider array of skin colors, such as bright yellow, blue, or red. Their skin smelled of old and wet plants, and appeared wet to the touch, but was actually dry. Grippli were quite small, with most individuals standing around 2 ft (0.61 m) tall, and weighing around 30 lb (14 kg). Older and more powerful grippli could be twice as tall and heavy.</p>
<p>They had a love of bright colors, and occasionally raided parties of travelers to obtain colored garments. Despite this, grippli rarely used much clothing beyond simple belts and loincloths . Grippli homes were decorated with brightly colored bits and bobs.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Grippli were generally peaceful, shy, and primitive. They subsisted on fruit and insects, and were fearful of snakes and spiders .</p>
<p>They were uncommonly intelligent, and could easily acquire new skills and learning. Despite this, Grippli almost never felt the need to manufacture anything themselves. Metal tools and weapons were treated as prized heirlooms.</p>
<p>Grippli engaged in trade with other peoples only rarely, when they were convinced the other party was not a threat. Due to their love of bright colors, grippli often purchased worthless, colored baubles from dishonest merchants. Grippli were intelligent enough to realize these merchants were taking advantage of them, but did not care overmuch since the baubles had great value to them.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The visual senses these creatures included both infravision and ultravision out to 10 feet (3 meters), which allowed them to operate well at both day and night. Their hands and feet were adapted to jungle environments, making them deft climbers and jumpers. They also could easily camouflage themselves in their native jungle environment.</p>
<p>Tribe mothers were capable of emitting a powerful musk , similar in nature to stinking cloud . A very small percentage of grippli, around 1-2%, were born psionically gifted. When they did, grippli always exhibited ego whip , psionic blast , thought shield , and tower of iron will .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>The frog folk tended to use weapons such as nets , snares, poisoned darts or bolts . These were the most preferred weapons of grippli because they did not hamper their climbing. They only rarely used arms made from metal, and usually did not wear armor in combat.</p>
<p>Grippli could apply strategy and tactics when needed, especially to overcome a more powerful foe. They favored the use of ambushes and traps to give themselves an advantage.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Grippli congregated in small villages consisting of houses made from mud-brick and wood. These were mostly situated on the ground, but a few settlements were built into the branches of large trees. A village typically consisted of anywhere between ten and sixty individuals, with a roughly equal distribution of sexes. These villages were often overseen by a tribe mother, who kept multiple mates. Although tribe mothers were the official leaders, most day-to-day governing was handled by elder male grippli.</p>
<p>The rare few, psionically gifted communities of grippli, were more secluded than other villages and relied heavily upon their powers for hunting.</p>
<h3>Homelands</h3>
<p>On the continent of Kara-Tur , grippli could be found on the Malatran Plateau .</p>
<p>Beyond Toril , grippli were known to exist on the planet of Oerth .</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>They spoke their own language, Grippli , and could croak other languages with some difficulty. Most grippli were illiterate, and considered all forms of writing taboo, except if performed by a tribe mother.</p>
<h3>Religions</h3>
<p>The grippli pantheon consisted of their primary, frog-like deity, as well as a number of evil snake and spider gods. The tribe mothers oversaw religious matters in their villages, and were believed to possess a measure of the frog-deity's blood.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Grippli were occasionally hunted by lizardfolk and kuo-toa , though eating grippli flesh was considered taboo by these races.</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>Grippli were long-lived, with some individuals reaching the venerable age of 700 years. They had very low birth rates, with a female typically giving birth to roughly six children in her lifetime.</p>
<p>Furthermore, grippli could be magically created through the evolve spell , which turned ordinary beasts into intelligent beings.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Since grippli maintained few records, and none of them were historical in nature, little was known of the origin of the frog folk. One popular theory maintained that grippli had always lived as they did: peacefully, secluded, and in harmony with their local environment.</p>
<p>Following the Procession of Justice in the Year of the Striking Lance, –247 DR , Exarch Thelasand IV of the fallen empire of Jhaamdath fled into the Wetwoods and was taken captive by grippli. A rieldoxia word crystal containing his thought images was discovered in an excavation outside the grippli settlement of Urml in the Year of the Spur, 1348 DR .</p>
