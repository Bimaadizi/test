<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Multum was once a thriving city with wide avenues that was home to a variety of races and was a center of trade. After it's destruction, the vaults of the former city became a tempting target for adventurers and treasure hunters.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1304 DR , the city was destroyed by evil-aligned outsiders . The outsiders conjured a massive amount of water from the Elemental Plane of Water and submerged the city, drowning its residents. As of 1372 DR, the ruins of Multum were still half underwater and home to schools of blind cave fish.</p>
