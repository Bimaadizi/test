<p>Oin'Chakalop was an illithid , member of a group of aberrations who ran the notorious Black Market, hidden in the mountains to the east from Samargol in the jungle nation of Samarach circa 1374 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In appearance, Oin'Chakalop was a standard mind flayer. The creature's behavior, however, was quite strange. Oin'Chakalop constantly twitched and made odd garbled noises that did not appear to be a language but rather insane mutterings and groans of an aberrant creature.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Oin'Chakalop was a highly respected seer and a prophet among his kin until one of his psychic travels took the mind flayer too far. Oin'Chakalop found himself touching the mind of a mad god. Many speculated that the mad god was Cyric himself. The contact shattered Oin'Chakalop's aberrant mind, leaving him incapable of speech. His fellow illithid Zhiir took the ex-seer under his wing to work as a servant in the Black Market of Samarach.</p>
