<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Through his toughness, courage, and strength of will, Jelvus Grinch rose to become the nominal leader of the people eking out a living in the ruins of Neverwinter following the city's destruction. He was known not to shy away from any challenge, but so too could recognize when he had no leverage in a confrontation.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>In his capacity as a capable leader of the ruined city of Neverwinter, Jelvus Grinch met and made allies of Artemis Entreri and Drizzt Do'Urden . He had also met Reginald Roundshield (as " Bonnego Battleaxe ") later in life.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After Mount Hotenow exploded in the Year of Knowledge Unearthed, 1451 DR , and destroyed his native city, Jelvus came to be recognized among the survivors as a leader, and was referred to by many as the "first citizen of Neverwinter".</p>
<p>In the Year of the Reborn Hero, 1463 DR , Jelvus allied with the Shadovar representative Herzgo Alegni against the Thayans . When Alegni seized power over the city that year, he invited Jelvus to be one of two human representative of Neverwinter at his council, and also declared him to be captain of his " White Guard ".</p>
<p>Following the arrival of Dagult Neverember in Neverwinter, Jelvus was sidelined, although he was offered a modicum of respect by the new regime in recognition that many citizens still looked to him for guidance. As of the Year of the Tasked Weasel, 1483 DR , he still commanded a few of the Guards manning The Wall .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Nether Mountain Scrolls, 1486 DR , an elderly Jelvus accompanied Lord Dagult Neverember and General Sabine to a meeting with Bruenor Battlehammer and Emerus Warcrown in Neverwinter to discuss the reclamation of Gauntlgrym from the drow .</p>
