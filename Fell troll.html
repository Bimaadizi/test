<p>Fell trolls , otherwise known as giant two-headed trolls , were one of the largest types of trolls in the Realms. Some believed that they were a cross-breed between trolls and ettins .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Fell trolls stood taller than most hill giants , standing at 15 feet (4.6 meters) tall, and had two heads atop its body that were filled with large, sharp fangs. The hair that protruded from these heads was long, straight, and fleshy. It often writhed of its own accord.</p>
<p>The skin of fell trolls was thick and rubbery, with knotty protrusions, and ranged in tones from mottled moss-green to gray. These knotty protrusions were especially prevalent on their shoulders and back. They moved around with an ungainly, hunched-over posture. They tended to dress in a similar fashion to ettins, wearing the slowly rotting skins of animals.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Due to them possessing two heads, it was difficult to use mind-affecting spells on a fell troll, such as charm and confusion , or otherwise deceive them by means of magic . Beyond that, they possessed the regenerative ability that was common to all trolls. However, giant two-headed trolls were earlier reported to not be capable of re-attaching their limbs.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>A fell troll viciously attacked its prey up close, latching onto their bodies with its claws and rending the flesh. It would alternatively try to bite at its prey with its massive maws. On very rare occasions, they would fight with some form of weapon.</p>
