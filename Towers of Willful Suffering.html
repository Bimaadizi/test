<p>The Towers of Willful Suffering was a temple and abbey complex located in Eshpurta , Amn . In the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , it was a quiet, contemplative place with a staff of 16 priests and a community of 48 followers, led by the Revered Mother of the House Heldatha Dhussta . The grounds and architecture were understated and plain, but its mere presence in Amn made it stand out more than opulence and grandeur ever could.</p>
