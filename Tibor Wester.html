<p>Tibor Wester was a businessperson who lived on the Sword Coast North during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was a spineless man who only looked out for himself and his interests.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>In the 1490s DR , Tibor established a logging camp in the Neverwinter Wood on the southern bank of the river where employed local woodsmen to harvest trees and send them downriver to Neverwinter . He purchased supplies from Barthen's Provisions in Phandalin rather than in Neverwinter to avoid paying the latter’s “devastation taxes”, and he often employed adventurers as escorts to this cargo.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Tibor had one known sibling, his half-brother Harbin Wester , who was the Townmaster of Phandalin and helped to organize shipments of supplies to his camp.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time after the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR , Tibor's camp was harried by ankhegs that were called forth by anchorites of Talos . The Talosian devotees resented the fact that Tibor and his operations intruded on their woodland home.</p>
