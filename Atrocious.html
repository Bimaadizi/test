<p>Atrocious was a flesh hound â€“ a chimera like monstrosity of animated beast part, created by Luvia Bloodmire in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Atrocious inhabited the dungeon lab of Luvia's within the Bloodmire Manor in the Upper City of Baldur's Gate . The guard dog of sorts was the sentry that stood by the passage to the mansion's deepest clears. When confronted with intruders, two-head Atrocious, alongside several smaller flesh hounds, would attack relentlessly with their poisonous gas vomit attacks, and Atrocious would launch chunks of its own body at the enemies. Presumably, the chimeric abomination was slain by the five heroes who stood against Mordoc Se Lanmere .</p>
