<p>The Tejarn Hills were a grouping of hills in southeastern Amn . At some times in history, they served as a border between Amn and Tethyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The hills appeared gradually but became excellent ground for defensive fortifications and ambushes. Off the road, the hills were exceptionally rough and difficult to traverse. Travelers on foot were exhausted by the constant struggle of picking their way across the hills, and horse mounts were extremely likely to slip and lame themselves.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>They were located southeast of Lake Esmel , east of the Small Teeth and west of the Forest of Shadows . These uplands were the source of the Hyrzashyr and Shimmalshyr rivers that flowed into Lake Esmel to the north.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>The urbane citizens of Athkatla and Murann generally considered anyone living in the wilderness of the Tejarn Hills and the regions near Shilmista to be bumpkins.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The region supplied root crops, livestock such as cattle , horses , and sheep , wines , beers , and ales , wild mushrooms and rare wildflowers to the rest of the country.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Tejarn Hills were for a long time part of the Ralamnish Ridings , the wild frontier lands that Calimshan conquered during its Third Age ( −1900 DR to −900 DR ). . A network of signal towers and army outposts that included the Nine Sentinels were constructed to defend the region, and the South Road was built to link these postings with the imperial core to the south.</p>
<p>The hills were the territory of the halfling realm of Meiritin from its founding in 227 DR until the inhabitants were driven out or conquered by Cortryn between 491 DR and 523 DR . The Hillforts of Torbold and Keshla were built at some point on the ruins of older Calishite fortifications.</p>
<p>During the 14 th century DR, the Council Army typically only patrolled along the South Road. Around Hillfort Keshla, the local farmers developed their own militia, the Torchriders , who raised the alarm against raiders.</p>
<p>In the 1350s DR , the ogre mage warlord Sothillis sent Chief Fedduk and the Skullgnasher hill giants to raid and skirmish throughout the hills. This drew the attention and efforts of the Council Army at Hillfort Torbold , which helped prevent the discovery of Sothillis's build-up of forces until the outbreak of the Sothillisian War in 1370 DR . Around this time, the Council Army's fight against monsters and raiders was supported by the militia of the nearby Citadel of the Banner Raised Anew , a temple of Arvoreen .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Amnian humans and halflings made up the "civilized" farmers and soldiers of the hills, but there were also significant numbers of hill giants, hobgoblins , goblins , and gnolls that posed a persistent threat. They were joined by deserters from the hillforts, who found a life of brigandage superior to suffering under military discipline.</p>
