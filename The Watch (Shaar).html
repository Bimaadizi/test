<p>The Watch was a wemic fighting brigade from the land of Shaar in south Faerûn , active some years before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Watch was a secretive organization consisting of warrior wemics that kept their goals hidden from the general public. However, it was known that the Watch was involved in extensive barter of weapons exchanged for information. The organization's reputation led all locals and those from neighboring lands to fear and avoid the Watch. Sages believed that the fear was justified: in the area where the Watch was active, several human nomadic tribes disappeared during the organization's active years. By the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the Watch's memory was preserved in a handful of enchanted shields from the wemics' armories called the shields of the Watch that gained wide use in the northwest Faerûn .</p>
