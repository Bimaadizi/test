<p>Necklaces of mystic eidolons were rare enchanted necklaces that could create a projected image of the wearer.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These items always appeared as a plain metal chain with pendants shaped like pyramids.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These necklaces had 2â€“9 pendants. When one of the pendants was twisted free and smeared with the wearer's blood, a projected image of the wearer would appear. The user could see through the eyes of their image and move it about by concentrating. Spellcasters could cast a single spell through their image and then it would vanish. The link between the user and their image could penetrate all known physical and magical barriers.</p>
<p>A pendant would wither away and vanish if blood did not come into contact with it within ten minutes of it being twisted free. Each pendant could only be used once and a necklace of mystic eidolons could not be recharged.</p>
