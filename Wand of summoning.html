<p>Wands of summoning were magic wands that allowed for a temporary summoning of creatures under the wielder's control.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These wands allowed the user to cast the summon creature IV spell, materializing several creatures under the caster's control. The effects of the wand's spell were temporary. A typical wand of summoning possessed five charges.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Historically, the first versions of these wands were first created by worshipers of long-forgotten beast totems. Even though these wands' origins were in divine magic, the 14 th century versions were created to wield arcane magics, and even the incantations used for creation differed greatly.</p>
