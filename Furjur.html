<p>Furjur , commonly known as Furjur the Flippant , was a famous merchant from Waterdeep who owned a shop called Furjur's Flying Carpet on Northwind Street in the city of Sundabar in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<p>Despite owning a shop in the Silver Marches , he was an absentee owner. Furjur's Flying Carpet was instead tended by six female shop-keeps.</p>
<p>Around the Year of the Morningstar, 1350 DR , Furjur gifted Nchaser's Eiyromancia to Lord Nasher Alagondar in exchange for a charter. The spellbook was sold to him by a band of adventuring dwarves in the depths of the northern forests.</p>
