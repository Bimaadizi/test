<p>Krehlan Arunsun was the son of Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun and Laeral Silverhand and the fourth Blackstaff .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Krehlan was silver-haired from birth.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Laeral noted in Lifelong with Regrets (published 1391 DR ) that Krehlan had his father's temper.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Laeral was pregnant with Krehlan by the end of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR .</p>
<p>Unlike his parents, Krehlan was not a Chosen of Mystra , but was still a highly skilled spellcaster, sufficient to become a Blackstaff . Krehlan became Blackstaff in the Year of Lost Ships, 1400 DR .</p>
<p>In the 1415 DR , Krehlan and the Grand Mages of Rhymanthiin dissipated the kiira N'Vaelhar , which held the spirit-templates and combined knowledge of Khelben Arunsun, Tsarra Chaadren , and Kyriani Agrivar , and bound its magic to Blackstaff Tower and its twin in Rhymanthiin, N'Vaerymanth .</p>
<p>Around 1424 DR , Krehlan was killed by Chartham Dellenvol . His successor was Ashemmon of Rhymanthiin. Krehlan's spirit-template went on to reside within Blackstaff Tower, along with the spirit-templates of the other former Blackstaffs.</p>
