<p>Aerie was an avariel spellcaster that lived in the nation of Amn during the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Unlike other avariel, Aerie had no wings. They were forcibly removed from her body in order to save her life after they became diseased.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Aerie could be very naive, exceptionally caring, and at the same time quite needy. The fact she no longer had her wings left Aerie feeling generally unworthy and useless. Aside from her preoccupation with her own faults, Aerie was very empathetic to the plight of others and always eager to help.</p>
<p>Due to her unique circumstances, Aerie did not feel worthy of approaching her old winged goddess Aerdrie Faenya . She learned from her mentor Quayle to serve the gnomish god Baervan Wildwanderer .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Aerie's earliest life was spent, apparently happily, in Faenya-Dail , one of the few remaining cities of her people. When she was still quite young, Aerie was captured by slavers when she swooped down from flight to rescue a child who was fleeing their clutches.</p>
<p>The slavers sold Aerie to a circus, where she was kept on display and in a cage so small she had no room to stand, much less stretch her wings. As an unfortunate result, her wings became diseased and infected. The infection threatened her life, which in turn was crudely saved when her wings were savagely amputated from her body.</p>
<p>While the circus had no use for a wingless avariel, the illusionist Quayle continued to take care of her as he had during her captivity—though he could do nothing to restore her wings. The pair of them continued their travels with another circus until it arrived in Athkatla and set up their tents within Waukeen's Promenade .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the disgruntled illusionist Kalah used powers of unknown origin to turn the inside of the tent into a world of deadly illusions. He transformed Aerie into the likeness of an ogre and magically chained her to the illusory realm within the circus tent.</p>
