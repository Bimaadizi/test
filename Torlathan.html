<p>Torlathan was a city in eastern Amn that served as an important trade stop with the Dragon Coast , named after the royal Torlath family.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The city was built on the north bank of the Valashar River , 75 miles (120 kilometers) upstream of its confluence with the Khalieshyr .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Torlathan was an important part of the overland caravans between Amn and Westgate over the Giant's Plain . It was destroyed during the early Crusade of Slaughter in the Year of the Raging Flame, 1255 DR , as the Bhaalist crusaders traveled from eastern Amn to Westgate along the trade route, crippling the east–west trade for decades. Attempts to rebuild the city and re-establish the trade routes proceeded slowly until the fall of the Amnian monarchy in the Year of the Crumbling Keep, 1276 DR , when it was abandoned completely.</p>
