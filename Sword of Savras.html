<p>The Sword of Savras was a magical flying longsword that roamed Faerûn since the mid-15 th century DR , attacking spellcasters seemingly at random.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Sword of Savras looked like a regular longsword made of plain metal, with a worn leather grip. When striking its targets, the sword would flare with bright blue light.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>The Sword of Spells only attacked victims capable of wielding arcane magic , and ignored any other creature. While no pattern could be discerned as how it choose its victims, it attacked very few warlocks and never targeted any Chosen of Mystra .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When a spellcaster was hit by the Sword of Spells, they suffered as much as much damage as if they were hit by a regular longsword, but would fall unconscious immediately. Should they survive their wounds, they would find themselves slightly weakened but with knowledge of a brand new, rare and unfamiliar spell .</p>
<p>When wounding warlocks, the sword would severe the pact binding them to their patron, causing them to lose their ability to wield arcane magic.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of spells bestowed by the sword to its victims:</p>
<p>In addition the sword was particularly fast and nimble, allowing it to avoid mundane attempts of capture. It was also enchanted with a powerful spell reflection effect protecting it from magical attacks.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Sword of Savras was created by the eponymous deity before its fight with Azuth . The sword originally healed any damage it caused upon withdrawal, and was intended by the deity as a mean to reward its worshipers with new and interesting magic. Used during the battle which opposed its creator against the ascending Lord of Spells, it suffered a volley of magic which damaged it and stripped it of its healing powers.</p>
<p>Encaged in a magic forcecage by Azuth, the sword reappeared during the Year of the Godly Invitation, 1449 DR , probably due to a weakening of its prison. It started attacking people with regularity until the Year of the Emerald Sun, 1454 DR , when it vanished for several months. After its reappearance later this year, Elminster managed to capture the sword and study it for a while.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>As the cause of the sword's existence was unknown before Elminster got a chance to study it, rumors abounded regarding its purpose. Some believed the artifact was created by Asmodeus , while others imagined it was the work of Szass Tam trying to weaken his competition.</p>
