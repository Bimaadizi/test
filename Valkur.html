<p>Valkur ( pronounced : / v ɑː l ˈ k ʌr / val-KURR ) was a minor Faerûnian god of sailors and their ships, as well as favorable winds and naval combat. The Captain of the Waves was the very picture of the daring sea captain, one capable of sailing his vessel through any disaster that the Gods of Fury could unleash.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Valkur's avatar appeared as a 10‑foot-tall (3‑meter) man of broad girth with a full, black beard and brown eyes that sparkled with derring-do. He had a great belly laugh, but when driven to anger his voice would crack like rolling thunder. He was often depicted wading through the ocean, the water only coming up to his knees, and was known to actually make such appearances.</p>
<p>As buffeted by uncountable storms as he seemed, Valkur always looked dapper. His fantastic captain's outfit consisted of a blue frock coat with gold braid trim and brass buttons over a colorful brocade vest and white shirt with a ruffled collar and cuffs, along with knee-length trousers, hose, and shoes with silver buckles. His tricorn hat shared the same color scheme: blue, but trimmed in gold braid and featured a large, white plume.</p>
<h3>Manifestations</h3>
<p>Valkur often manifested as an aurora borealis or aurora australis and sailors swore that he appeared to becalmed ships at sea as a ghostly wind in which his image could be faintly glimpsed. Sometimes he manifested as a ghostly ship on the horizon, which always sailed to the nearest port but never seemed to get closer or farther away.</p>
<p>Valkur was served by many intelligent and benevolent animals, including dolphins , whales (especially narwhals ), and seabirds. He used the latter to indicate his mood; manifesting as a silver albatross or gull drifting on the wind currents to indicate his favor, and as a night-black raven to convey his displeasure.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Valkur was usually jolly and never held a grudge. He was a figure of endless luck and great boldness, emphasizing his points by shaking his fist in the air and never backing away from a challenge. However, he was not always available for his followers, and there was no guarantee that he would answer a call for aid. He was fickle and unpredictable, his moods as mercurial as the weather, but he was always extremely loyal to his crew and did in fact feel his primary responsibility was protecting sailors. Though still unreliable, he had become more responsive to his faithful's petitions after the Time of Troubles .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Valkur could pilot any sailing craft in any conditions, and no ship on which he stood would ever sink, regardless of its condition or the surrounding weather. He specialized in the use of cutlasses , harpoons , and tridents , but was proficient in the use of all melee weapons and naval armaments; as well as the arquebus . He favored conjuration , divination , and evocation spells, as well as those from the spheres of divination , air , water , and weather .</p>
<p>The Captain of the Waves functioned just as well in water as he could above it and could stride knee-deep through water of any depth using a form of modified water walking , hence his ability to seemingly wade through the ocean. Each hour he could call 2-5 whales to come to his aid, usually a pod of narwhals or orcas , but on rare occasions (about 1 in 20 times) a single leviathan would answer his summons.</p>
<p>Valkur could change the weather within a 1‑mile (1,600‑meter) radius of himself, calming stormy seas simply by placing his hand on the water's surface or stirring up storms by swirling his hand within it. He could breathe a gust of wind every minute and breathe water as air. In addition to being undrownable, he was immune to elemental water spells , water elementals and related creatures, and electricity and lightning. He could bestow all of these immunities, and the ability to swim, to anyone he touched; a blessing known as the "shield of Valkur" which lasted for a day.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Valkur wielded the Captain's Cutlass , a +3 weapon able to cast a weather-related spell every minute; its power varying based on the aptitude of the wielder. Though normally a cutlass, it could transform into a trident or harpoon with an unbreakable rope tether attached to the wielder's wrist that could extend as required by the user. The weapon was sized for Valkur, had increased range in his hand, and (so long as the line was attached to him) left him unable to be knocked over or toppled from a deck that he stood upon. Sometimes he loaned it to the faithful or those on special missions for him, but in anyone else's hands, it was normal-sized and had normal range.</p>
<p>Valkur also possessed a great shield with which he turned back the worst that nature had to throw at him. In some religious images he was at the helm of the great galleon Windjammer ; a ship able to not only sail across any sea, but even through the heavens.</p>
<h2>Realm</h2>
<p>Valkur's realm was located in either Ysgard in the Great Wheel Cosmology , or Warrior's Rest (as part of Tempus 's realm) in the World Tree and World Axis Cosmologies . His domain stood apart from the others, primarily due to the terrain but also for its relative calm. Safe Harbor , as it was called, was a placid range of saltwater between two warzones: a desert battlefield and a larger, watery expanse of raging naval battles.</p>
<h2>Activites</h2>
<p>Valkur often used the tether ability of the Captain's Cutlass to tow ships to shore, hauling them in hand-over-hand, and there was at least one occurrence where he harpooned a sea monster and used it for tow. Some claimed to have seen him stride through the waves dragging a small boat to sailors who went overboard, feeding them with the sea biscuits and casks of water contained within.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Valkur looked to Selune for guidance across the oceans of Faerun, the two sharing such a friendship that the moon goddess passed on a minor blessing to Valkur's faithful in the form of improved navigational abilities. In more recent times, Deep Sashelas of the Seldarine lent his aid to the Captain of the Waves so that he could better act as a counterweight to Umberlee 's burgeoning influence; and Istishia , the elemental god of water, had ties to Valkur even if he was uninterested in his sailors (or Umberlee's storms for that matter).</p>
<p>The Red Knight , and by extension Tempus , attempted to persuade Valkur to take a greater interest in the area of naval conflict. Her expectations of him sometimes exceeded his demonstrated commitment to anything but protecting sailors, but she still saw him as her best ally in that field despite his unreliability. Tempus himself was casually friendly with Valkur, as he was at least somewhat martially inclined, and at one point the sailor's god become an exarch of his.</p>
<p>Valkur was the sworn foe of the Gods of Fury, as the Captain of the Waves protected ships from the destruction wrought by their leader Talos , invoked as he was by sailors to intercede with favorable winds. His true nemesis among them however was the Sea Queen Umberlee, whose cruel whimsy he defended sailors against. She might yet try to destroy the upstart for daring to challenge her dominion, but as far as could be discerned he continued to defy her without significant retribution.</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Valkur was little known by those who dwelled inland. While there were many gods that Faerûnian sailors might pray to in regards to their work, Valkur was invoked in hopes of good tidings for the ship, all hands onboard, and the voyage as a whole. Besides sailors, he was venerated by many along the coasts who made their living from the sea; ranging from rich merchants to simple fisherfolk. His clergy was loosely organized, with many of its clerics serving as captains or sailors aboard ships. Usually they met each other only by happenstance, such as when they were both serving the same ship or were present in the same port.</p>
<p>In the past, Northlanders only honored Valkur occasionally; as a result of the unreliability of his protection. In more recent times he had become their unique god; the mighty deity that they revered and honored above all others. In him they saw embodied and exemplified the traits that they, particularly their warriors, most admired and treasured: strength, courage, ferocity, guile, and sailing skill. To question, let alone insult, this veneration was not advisable.</p>
<p>Valkur was venerated by the humans and general half-elf populance of Aglarond . He was a favored deity in Impiltur , Altumbel , Tharsult , and Wizard's Reach , appeased and beseeched by sea traders in Amn , and significiant in areas where Illuskans and Tethyrians lived together.</p>
<p>Water genasi tended towards deities of water, including Valkur. Those who revered him were respected by common sailors and welcomed aboard by captains, as even those without a taste for adventure loved working on boats. Clerics among air genasi were also known to choose Valkur as a patron.</p>
<h3>Dogma</h3>
<p>Valkur's doctrine placed emphasis on the importance of defying the odds and daring the impossible. This exploratory spirit was seen as both necessary to spread the reach of humanity and for the thrill in and of itself. It was a philosophy of carpe diem that embraced risk and viewed life on a ship - feeling and fighting the elements themselves - as the greatest, most invigorating feeling in the world. Notably, his dogma encouraged self-sufficiency and independence in his followers and placed himself third in their list of priorities; their loyalties going first to their crew and second to their ship.</p>
<h3>Rituals</h3>
<p>Clerics of Valkur prayed for their spells around dawn, upon the stirring of the first breeze. Valkur's church celebrated only one holy day known as the Shattering. The exact date of the festival varied but it was always celebrated in the spring. The purpose of the festival was to celebrate the breaking up of ice floes in the north, which marked the beginning of the sailing season.</p>
<p>Valkur's name was spoken to bless the spirits of dead sailors and lost ships.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Valkur's worship originated in North Faerûn centuries before the 13 th century. He seemed tied to the story of a legendary captain from Mintarn , a mortal sailor (possibly himself) who challenged Umberlee and emerged victorious against all odds. One thing that was known about Valkur's mortal life was that he once was friends with the mage Gullwyn who, after retiring from his life at sea, gifted Valkur his famous enchanted dagger called the Dagger of Safe Harbor . From there his faith spread quickly to Tethyr and Amn; where it became centered, steadily increasing southward.</p>
<p>Valkur's activities during the Time of Troubles were unclear. Since then, he had worked on his unresponsiveness; which had resulted in northern sailors trying to placate the Gods of Fury rather than seek his unreliable protection. Although his help still could not be relied upon, he had become more attentive to entreaties from his faithful. In the 15 th century DR , his focus had notably recentered to the North to the point that he was considered a deity of Northlander sailors.</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>The sight of a species of spined fish named Valkur's fish , so named for the belief that Valkur left the dark, eye-like spot on their side with his thumb, was considered good luck.</p>
<p>In the Valkuryte faith, the northern tropic was called Trethen and the southern tropic Lonthen .</p>
