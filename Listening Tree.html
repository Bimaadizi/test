<p>The Listening Tree was an ancient massive oak tree in Elventree that was pruned so the leaves and branches acted like an amphitheater with perfect acoustics.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The tree stood in the exact center of Elventree around 1367 DR . Thousands of suspended globes enchanted with continual light illuminated the tree.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>An audience used the branches of the tree for seating for performances staged on a large branch three-quarters of the way up the tree. Meetings of significant importance to the community were held here as well.</p>
