<p>Umbregard was a mage, once of Galadorna , in the midâ€“8 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He came to be friends with Starsunder . Tenthar Taerhamoos , the Archmage of the Phoenix Tower , had been his foe of many years.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He carried at least two wands for aggressive magic, some rings , and a walking staff that was old, fire-hardened, and copper -shod.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In spring of the Year of the Awakening Wyrm, 767 DR , Umbregard went to Tangletrees , where he talked to the elven wizard Starsunder, looking for information on Elminster Aumar , the last Court Mage of the realm of Galadorna, and on how should mages conduct themselves. He was accepted as the grove found him worthy, a sign of it being the flowers and stalks that sprouted from his staff. Their discussion soon turned to Elminster's temptations that came with the power he wielded thanks to age and sorcery. Their conversation grew long, and was only interrupted by the elf receiving notice that flame was wielded in a distant forest, near what was the Dead Place ; they crossed a portal to reach it.</p>
<p>Across the ocean, they fought a number of Sharran Dreadspells ; they only prevailed because of the intrusion of his foe of many years, Tenthar Taerhamoos. Starsunder was badly injured during the fight, and in the aftermath, Tenthar helped heal him. Elminster later healed him and his friend completely.</p>
