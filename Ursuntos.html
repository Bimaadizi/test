<p>Ursuntos was the Grand Disciple of Orcus who oversaw the Temple of Filth in the Shadowfell city of Evernight as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Ursuntos spoke with a raspy voice. He hungered for the flesh of his enemies, and would recite a series of oaths to Orcus as he prepared their bodies to be eaten.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Ursuntos could paralyze his foes with his voice, allowing his allies to mob them. Any ghoul who was slain in his presence would rise again as a zombie .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Ursuntos was the most politically powerful being in Evernight aside from the tribunal . His ghoul and vampire underpriests tended to his every whim with haste.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was said that, in life, Ursuntos had been a servant of Orcus who killed and ate a priest of Bahamut , and when he finally died—with a prayer to Orcus on his lips—this great sin caused him to experience an unholy transformation into a powerful and terrifying ghoul in Orcus's service. As of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , he had become the Grand Disciple at the Temple of Filth.</p>
