<p>Othokent was the leader of the Lizardfolk of Throden in Forestfall Fen as of the late 15 th century DR , although they in turn served "Queen" Vorazidrar , a powerful black dragon .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Othokent towered above other lizardfolk and wielded a club in battle.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>They were calculating, terse, and highly pragmatic. Like their fellow Throden lizardfolk, Othokent sought peace and order rather than conflict.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Othokent served the Queen out of necessity rather than loyalty, and claimed to do so as long as the tribute she was paid was rewarded in kind. However, Vorazidrar incredible power was the real reason that Othokent could not defy her, and thus they had no qualms about abandoning their "Queen" if her power was broken.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When adventurers from Waterdeep arrived in Thorden in the late 15 th century DR, Othokent faced them in battle but ultimately was defeated. Othokent acknowledged their loss by laying down their club and—tersely—explaining the relationship between the lizardfolk and the dragon. The adventurers would go on to free the lizardfolk from Vorazidrar when they bested her in combat and sealed her inside her lair.</p>
