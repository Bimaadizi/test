<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Elemental drakes tended to be evil or neutral at best.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>All of the elemental drakes had differing abilities depending on their elemental affinities. They flew, had darkvision , and spoke the Draconic language as well as an appropriate elemental language. Compared to dragons and even humans, however, they were not particularly intelligent. Despite this, they were difficult to surprise.</p>
