<p>Maztapan Island was a large island that rose up from the water immediately east of the Gulf of Kultaka and later claimed as territory of the Borderlands and its capital, New Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Maztapan Island was a dry island located at the southwestern end of the Gulf of Cordell in Maztica . The island was just off the coast of the Maztican nation of Kultaka . With the fall of Nexal and colonization, Maztapan was claimed by New Waterdeep, and it neighbored the territories of New Amn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR , in the days that preceded the Night of Wailing , an Amnian vessel called Helm's Choice , under the command of Captain Quintara , traveled past the strait between Maztapan and the mainland. The ship was ambushed by a curious giant squid , who thought the boat to be a new and exciting edible prey that had wandered into its territory. The sea beast was scared off, but Helm's Choice sustained damage and was forced to land.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR , twelve trade ships from Waterdeep were denied docking at the New Amnian colony of Helmsport because of the Council of Six's newly imposed restrictions on transoceanic trade. The ships sailed further west until they had their first landfall on the island of Maztapan. Soon after, the Waterdhavian ships crossed the Gulf of Kultaka and established the colony of the New Waterdeep, naming the claimed territory as the Borderlands. Eventually, Maztapan Island became a mooring site for New Waterdeep.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the first settlement of the New Waterdeep was attacked and razed to the ground by Kultakan raiders. Survivors of the attack fled to Trythosford and eventually rebuilt New Waterdeep on Maztapan Island by Eleint 4 of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR .</p>
