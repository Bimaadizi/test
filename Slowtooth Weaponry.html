<p>Slowtooth Weaponry was a weapon shop located in the city of Wheloon in Cormyr . Its proprietor was Nym "Slowtooth" Nindar .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The store stood on the southwest corner of where the Way of the Manticore crossed the Westbank March in Wheloon.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Because the store was stocked with weapons, the local Purple Dragons guarded it as if it was an armory.</p>
<p>Regardless, Nindar (a retired Dragon himself) operated his own defenses against thieves. He was skilled with throwing axes and had cords under his desk with which he could open shutters in the windows and door from a distance. Thus he could bury an axe in a thief anywhere in or outside his store.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Slowtooth Weaponry was in business by 1358 DR . It was still in business through 1369 DR , and in 1374 DR .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Slowtooth Weaponry sold, of course, all kinds of weapons, and was the best in town. It also bought and sold magical weapons. When not otherwise busy, Nindar had a side-business instructing other warriors and young folk in how to wield specific weapons, and in their proper maintenance. Nindar was skilled with many kinds of weapons and could teach them all, though his specialty was the throwing axe.</p>
<p>The store was popular with mercenaries , adventurers , and perhaps even brigands, who often hung around to watch Nindar train his students. They often shared tales of their exploits, and drank Nindar's mulled cider .</p>
<h2>Staff</h2>
<p>The store was managed by Nym Nindar and his five sons. When he was teaching students, his sons took over the shop.</p>
