<p>The Embassy of Ravens Bluff was the center of diplomatic relations between the city of Ravens Bluff and the City of Splendors, Waterdeep in the 14 th century DR . The Embassy was also entrusted to hold trade and international relations negotiations on behalf of the Bluff with nations of and near the Sword Coast .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Embassy of Ravens Bluff was a two-storied building located in the Sea Ward , just a few blocks away from the Temple of Luck, or the Tower of Luck . The road on which the building stood stretched from north to south for about twenty-one city blocks.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR, the Embassy was led by Chalnath Tressoon , the Ambassador to Waterdeep, well-respected and loved not just by the people of Ravens Bluff but also by the people of the City of splendors. The second in the chain of command was the Aid to the Ambassador and a socialite Richard Renqueth , who spent most of his life in Waterdeep.</p>
<p>Another notable embassy employee at the time was Tames , a "Houtman" or houseman, who's been in the Ravenaar employ for over seven years.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Ravenian Ambassador to Waterdeep, Chalnath Tressoon, was killed in a dark alley. The Ambassador's body, as well as the bodies of his bodyguards, were all found by his aide, Richard Renqueth. The clergy of Tymora could not determine the cause of death. In response, the Ambassador's family contacted the mayor of Ravens Bluff. A group of heroes from the Living City was tasked with the delivery of the Tressoon family's rod of resurrection to return the dead dignitary to the land of the living. The government of Ravens Bluff requested Lords of Waterdeep to not be involved in the case. The request was honored, and the Ambassador's death was not publicly announced in fears of trade negotiations between Calimshan and Ravens Bluff being affected, as Chalnath Tressoon was the one helming them. The embassy itself was also raided, with much of its furniture, carpentry, and drapery in ruins. However, none of the embassy staffers was killed. All the staffers were knocked out cold with sleeping smoke bombs.</p>
<p>The target of the robbery was the rod. It was snatched by Whisper and his Shadowhands . The heroes embarked on a quest to find the elusive "Shadowed Man." Eventually, the search brought them to Undermountain , where the shadow dragon , the "Shadowed Man" himself, made a lair. After a confrontation, Whisper was slain, allowing the adventurers to return the rod to the Embassy and resurrecting Chalnath Tressoon in a ritual performed by the clerics of the nearby Tower of Luck.</p>
