<p>A Pursuivant Arcane was a mage on a mission from Mystra, granted secret powers.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>While acting as a pursuivant arcane, a mage could take wraithform once a tenday for half an hour.</p>
<p>They also gained six free spells daily. They could cast any spell they knew as such a free spell, without choosing ahead of time or memorizing; their only limitation was that they could use only two attack spells, two defensive spells, and two divination spells a day.</p>
<p>Finally, they could talk to Azuth or Mystra , asking them to manifest. Doing this without a pressing reason was a bad idea, however, and even saving one's life wasn't always good enough a reason.</p>
<h2>Secrecy</h2>
<p>A Pursuivant Arcane who announced their status lost it immediately, manifesting a ring of black flames as a visual marker.</p>
