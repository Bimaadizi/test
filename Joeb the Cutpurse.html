<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the adventurer known as the Knight-Commander, or Kalach-Cha , roused the spirits of Rashemen . Soon after the Knight-Commander's arrival to Mulsantir, an army of spirits, telthors led by the Bear-God Okku , gathered outside and demanded the life of the Knight-Commander. The adventurer approached Tirzah the Old , the witch-warden of Mulsantir's jail was to help find allies, willing or unwilling, who would stand beside the Knight-Commander against angry spirits. Tirzah insisted that hagspawn named Gannayev-of-Dreams , another hagspawn Mighty Groznek , and Joeb the Cutpurse were not to be trusted. Joeb had no interest in facing sure death at the paws of angry spirits; he claimed to be just a traveler from Luiren who found himself in a kerfuffle and a misunderstanding in regard to the ownership of some coins in Mulsantir's bazar.</p>
