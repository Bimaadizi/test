<p>The Temple of the Goddess was a ruined temple, dedicated to an indeterminate goddess , on the Island of Viledel in the Korinn Archipelago .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This temple was situated on the far slope of a large hill, overlooking the Manor of the Sea King .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Temple of the Goddess stood two stories tall and was made with expensive planks of dark hardwood imported from the Faer√ªnian mainland. It sported spacious windows with brightly-painted and cheerful shutters.</p>
<p>Against the right half of the temple's front face leaned a trellis for ivy that was well tended. And before the large entrance of the temple, oaken double doors, was a well-crafted wrought iron gate. The back of the temple had an enclosed garden that was nicely kept and well planted. It had a stone pathway leading to a small well, a door inside of the temple, and further north down to the Sea King's manor.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Adder, 1328 DR , most of the temple's wood had become cracked, decayed, and pitted. Most of its shutters were gone, while the few that remained either hung crookedly from a single hinge or banged open-and-close with the wind. The iron gate had rusted over, clear through in some areas. The temple's trellis had gone away, with its ivy left to cover the entire right side of the temple, holding close any shutter it grew over. And the flowering plants of the rear garden overgrew, covering over and breaking the stone pathway.</p>
<h3>Interior</h3>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Daystars, 1268 DR , a kingdom of pirates launched an attack upon the Island of Viledel. They quickly overran it, destroying nearly the whole population. However, the pirates showed respect to the goddess and left her temple untouched. Since this incident the temple was left abandoned and became occupied by rats . The sole survivor of the pirate attack, a man named Keestake , would frequently visit the temple over the years, using it for shelter as well as subsisting off of its rats and well water.</p>
<p>Circa 1328 DR, a merchant ship ran aground of the Island of Viledel's northern shore after its crew was preyed upon by a ghoul that had once been a thief in life. The creature made its way into the temple and created a nest, surviving by feasting upon the building's rats. Keestake encountered this ghoul on a number of occasions, but always managed to outrun it.</p>
<p>A few months later, a group of archipelago inhabitants that included Melisana of Ventris were captured by slavers and sent sailing on a galley towards the pirate stronghold of Westhaven . Around this same time, members of the orc tribe Hak-kubra sacked the temple in search of treasure.</p>
<p>Enraged when they could find no gold, the orcs began breaking furniture and clubbing walls in the temple's main hall. Creating deep gouges and tears in the plaster of its walls, as well as smearing filth on them. The orcs then tore apart the walls of the temple's offices in search of secret passages or panels. They swung their axes at the kitchen walls, but left its tables unharmed. They wrecked the living quarters on the second floor, carving up walls and tearing out paneling. And finally, they went up to the altar chamber to desecrate the goddess's statue. They broke off its nose and left hand, then created a crack across its torso and smeared it with filth. This desecration brought about a terrible storm that raged around the island. The orcs quickly fled the temple, becoming deathly afraid of ever returning to it.</p>
<p>Three days after the temple sacking, the violent storm sent most of the galley's crew overboard and it crashed upon the shores of Viledel Isle. The group of enslaved people then managed to escape their jailor, a drunken half-orc named Hafkris . Making their way over some low hills on the western side of the cove they had crashed in, the group soon came upon the now elderly Keestake. He informed them of his backstory and the Hak-kubra tribe's sacking of the temple, which he learned during his time as a captive of them, then offered to lead them to the Temple of the Goddess. As Keestake made his way through the temple he made a fire out of the broken furniture of the main hall and pointed out the vandalization of the orcs.</p>
<p>When the group entered the kitchen they were overheard by the ghoul, huddled silently above them, but it only attacked them if it was spotted. After exploring much of the temple and learning information from Keestake, night fell upon the temple and most or all of the exhausted group went to sleep in the main hall. That night the goddess appeared before the individual she favored the most by inhabiting the marble statue of the altar chamber with her essence. As she inhabited it the statue had a subdued glow around it, its damaged parts became repaired, and the filth covering it disappeared.</p>
<p>After asking the mortal why their group had come to her temple, the goddess informed them that she had chose to destroy Viledel Isle in retaliation for the debasement wrought by the Hak-kubra tribe. But seeing no reason to have innocents destroyed, she decided to delay her destruction until the following night, hopeful that it would give them enough time to escape the island. Any attempt to dissuade her from destroying the island was unheeded. She also informed them that there were magical items on the island which could aid them in their endeavors.</p>
<p>When the goddess departed from the statue, it returned to its perch on the throne and remained undamaged. Hours later, the ghoul hiding in the temple launched an attack upon the group.</p>
