<p>The Gorey Eye-Beast was a rough tavern located in the city of Zhentil Keep during the mid-14 th century DR before that city's destruction.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The tavern was located within Zhentil Keep's Common Quarter in the southeast section of the city at the intersection of Beholder Street and Moonsea Avenue .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The sign hanging outside of the tavern depicted an eye tyrant whose fangs were dripping blood.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The mispelling of "gory" in the tavern's name served as an accurate preview of the crude clientele found within. The Gorey Eye-Beast catered mostly to wicked humanoids such as orcs , ogres , and hobgoblins . Any humans or demihumans entering the tavern were met by a half dozen ogres armed with clubs . Anyone skilled enough to make it past the ogre bouncers were allowed to stay, though they were watched carefully.</p>
