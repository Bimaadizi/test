<p>Suthik was a duergar raid leader in 1484 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Just after the start of the War of the Silver Marches , the king of Gracklstugh ordered Suthik to lead a duergar band inside the Underdark section of Citadel Adbar in order to recover the Wand of Tir'Lien , which had been sold to drow . During the exploration, however, a mimic killed many of the Suthik's thugs. At last, Suthik and his surviving minions retreated into a cave. There they were attacked and defeated by an adventuring party hired by King Harbromm .</p>
