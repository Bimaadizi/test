<p>Arisrathra Baerlbohun was the daughter of Unsible Baerlbohun , the "Mad Toymaker," who rose to wealth and prominence in Athkatla in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Arisrathra was a revelry-lowing and wild daughter of a gaudy-rich and decadent merchant Baerlbohun family. Some described her as a "winking" woman who was renowned for being "ready and willing for all foolery" among men of Athkatla. She spent her time as an eager revel-companion and social butterfly of the city's affluent Gem District .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR , Arisrathra was the most well-known member of the family, apart from her "Mad Toymaker" father. She had three large, lazy, lumbering brothers, Purdynkul Baerlbohun being the oldest. Along with most of the family, Arisrathra Baerlbohun resided in a famously gaudy monstrosity of a mansion in the Gem District â€“ Baerlbohun House , not to be confused with equally vulgarly grandiose Baerlbohun Towers .</p>
