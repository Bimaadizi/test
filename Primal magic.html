<p>Primal magic was a form of magic associated with both the natural world of the Prime Material plane and the Spirit World . It was considered one of the primordial forces of nature, one that served as a bulwark against influences and threats from other planes of existence .</p>
<h2>Nature of Primal Magic</h2>
<p>Nearly all aspects of the natural world were somehow linked to primal magic, including all manner of animals, vegetation, weather patterns, and even individual planets . The nature of primal magic was believed to change in form and essence depending on the land and world through which it passed. In some locales in the cosmos , primal magic manifested in such a way as to alter fruit -bearing trees and imbue them with supernatural properties.</p>
<p>Primal magic was considered 'untamed' and even alien by denizens of planes beyond the Prime Material, most notably the Feywild . When primal magic manifested near fey crossroads it became more 'pure' in nature, and could be used to partially seal the breach between the planes. Paradoxically, some scholars believed that primal magic was the force of the multiverse that bound the Feywild and the Prime together.</p>
<p>The power of each individual's truename originated from the essence of primal magic.</p>
<h2>Practitioners</h2>
<p>Primal magic was often associated with those that made their home in the wilderness and tended to nature, such as druids , shamans , and barbarians . It took exceptional self-discipline and foresight to wield this power; failure to do so often inadvertently caused grievous harm to the caster and anyone else nearby.</p>
<p>The specifics of wielding primal magic were often overlooked by non-practitioners. To them, all forms of primal magic were uniform and indistinguishable in their practice.</p>
<h3>Creatures</h3>
<p>While scholarly works stated that primal magic was foreign to the Feywild, others maintained that the fey possessed incredible control over primal magic powers. For instance, dryads were fey creatures that possessed the distinct ability to wield primal magic in defense of their home-trees.</p>
<p>Shifters preferred to dwell in lands that were steeped in primal magic.</p>
<h3>Organizations</h3>
<p>The practice of primal magic was especially notable among the shapeshifters of Dambrath , the Tuigan of the Hordelands , the hengeyokai of the Ama Basin , and the half-orcs of the Green Moss tribe of Many-Arrows in the Spine of the World .</p>
