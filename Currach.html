<p>A currach was a large, round boat used mainly for fishing in Aglarond and Turmish . It was sometimes known as a coracle .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The hull of a currach was built using thick animal hides or canvas stretched over a frame made from wood or wicker . A typical specimen was 20 feet (6.1 meters) long by 8 feet (2.4 meters) wide, with a single mast for a sail and four oars . Crew size ranged from a minimum of two to a maximum of ten. Currachs were not built to carry a weapon or a ram. The seaworthiness of this vessel limited it to coastal waters, where it was used for fishing.</p>
<h2>Notable Currachs</h2>
