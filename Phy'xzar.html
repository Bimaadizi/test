<p>Phy'xzar was a drider serving House Argith that joined their expedition to Tethyamar in the 1480s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During Talice Argith 's attempts to obtain the jewels of ardor in Tethyamar, Phy'xzar was assigned the duty of keeping captured dwarves from the Tethyamar Mining Outpost , alongside Phyrsinil and Uhlsirayn . He put the dwarves to work mining more jewels of ardor, keeping two mind-controlled dwarves and two ogre battle thralls on him as a bodyguard. Eluf the Steadfast sent Rielle Proudforge and a team of surfacers to rescue the dwarves, and so the drider jailer was slain and his victims freed.</p>
