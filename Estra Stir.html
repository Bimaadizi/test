<p>Estra Stir was an opportunistic journalist who wrote for the Baldur's Mouth broadsheet from the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Estra was an olive-skinned human woman of haughty demeanor and expensive finery. She wore dark makeup and had her glisteningly-black hair slicked back.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Estra's attention was laser-focused on the so-called True Heroes of Baldur's Gate, who, at the time, had recently arrived at the Gate and brought a reputation baggage along. Estra's writing was not flattering, and when she met them face-to-face near the Basilisk Gate in the Lower City, the journalist smugly announced that they were going to star in the next issue of Baldur's Mouth. Estra, however, did not elaborate on the piece that would turn out to be a hit piece. Estra's editor, Ettvard Needle , took on a stand that the Heroes should've had not discharged themselves in public and that their actions had consequences. He worried not with the article being truthful or misleading. Estra's piece was allowed due to Ettvard's belief that the True Soul heroes brought along a spike in the Cult of the Absolute activities in the city and looked down on them getting involved in a murder investigation.</p>
<p>It was unknown if Estra's stirring piece hit the print or if the True Souls were helped to stop the publishing by Jelliwig , the printing press . They also could've convinced the printing press to change the article to praise and heroes instead.</p>
