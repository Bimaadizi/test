<p>Bacon was a fatty cut of pork , generally from the side of a pig or boar , eaten largely across northern and western Faerûn .

In the the Dragon Reach , a slab of bacon was called a "sideslab" and a slice of bacon was referred to as a "cautel".</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bacon was used in all manner of dishes, but it was particularly common to eat it for morning meals as part of a dawnfry or morningfeast . In the Western Heartlands , it was commonly served alongside toasted bread flavored with the bacon drippings, or in thick slabs garnished with fruit (such as quince ) and scrambled eggs , occasionally paired with coffee . In the Dalelands , it might be accompanied by some or all of fresh milk , dove 's eggs , grapes , radishes , savory tarts , fried mushrooms , cheese , fried bread, tomatoes and wine . In the Lands of Intrigue , it might be served alongside pancakes and honey - molasses syrup, with eggs, or in omelets along with additions like sausage , cheese, onions , and peppers . In the Moonsea , it was eaten alongside eggs and honeycakes . In Ravens Bluff , it was eaten with eggs and occasionally with Zakharan coffee. In the Border Kingdoms , it was eaten alongside eggs, ham , toast, and fruit like apples and melons . The Ffolk of the Moonshae Isles ate bacon with goose eggs and fresh cream paired with either cake or bread, and the dwarves of the Moonshaes kept it as travel food. On the Sea of Swords , ships might stock bacon alongside breakfast steak , fried potatoes , wheat cakes , and oranges for morning meals. In the North , bacon was often served along with fried bread, accompanied with things like a wedge of cheese, dark beer , and a raw onion, or with eggs and fried fish . The dwarves of the North ate bacon with eggs, muffins , and berries .</p>
<p>Aside from being a morning food, bacon was an important ingredient in many other dishes and meals across dwarven, human , and even orcish cuisine. Examples included High Dale lamb (a traditional dish from Highcastle ), dwarven Potato leek soup , and many low-brow or common meals, such as hack in Amn (fried slices of smoked fish and bacon), bloodlick in the Vast (a gravy-like spread eaten on bread by farmers), and "orc" bacon (spiced or sweetened baked bacon strips). Bacon dishes were also popular as tavern food and in pies and hand pies , often paired with leek , kidney , or gooseberries .</p>
<p>Bacon generally stored and travelled well, especially when wrapped in wax paper, which perhaps contributed to it being a reliable ration among manual laborers, sailors, soldiers, and adventurers .</p>

<p>Bacon fat was used to cook vegetables like mushrooms and onions and was an important ingredient in pastry dough throughout the Eastern Heartlands . The Watchful Eye in Essembra used bacon fat in the pastry of their Stuffed Turkey Pie , and the Wight on a Waterdragon restaurant in Marsember used it to make the pastry shell of their "sea pie" (filled with various macerated sea creatures cooked in beef stew). Bacon fat was measured by the knife .</p>
<p>In a pinch, flaming bacon could be used as a weapon.</p>
