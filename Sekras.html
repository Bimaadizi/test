<p>Sekras was a ruined city located in the country of Unther during the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Sekras sat along the shore of the Blue Sword River in close proximity to the border with Mulhorand .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As of the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , a machine that filtered salt from Azulduth from the river still operated in Sekras. Only a handful of priests of Thoth understood how it worked.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the time of ancient Mulhorand, Sekras was known for contributing to the development of new weapon technologies. Between -700 DR and -200 DR , many advancements were made in the development of Mulhorandi swords , such as the khopesh .</p>
<p>Sekras was once the center of worship of Sebek , the Lord of Crocodiles. The city thus became infested with werecrocodiles , prompting paladins of Osiris to eradicate them in the Year of the Grisly Ghosts, 1183 DR . Sekras was reduced to ruins during this process, prompting many of the surviving werecrocodiles to flee to the Adder Swamp and the Lake of Salt . The paladins who drove them out went on to found the Brotherhood of Those Who Smile in the Face of Death .</p>
<p>As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , the ruins were once again notable for the presence of werecrocodiles.</p>
