<p>Giant pikes were a monstrous variety of the mundane fish known as pikes .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Giant pikes had long, flexible bodies with greenish-yellow scales that helped them blend into parts of their environment. Their bodies could grow up to 9​ to ​14 feet (2.7​ to ​4.3 meters) in length. They were also very rapid swimmers.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Giant pikes were very aggressive. When hungry, they were liable to attack almost any nearby creature.</p>
