<p>The Big Board with Nail , or simply a goblin herder , was a unique but deadly hobgoblin bludgeon that once was a symbol of power among gnomes of the village of Treeroot .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Big Board with Nail was enchanted to be effective when wielded against goblinoids , effectively becoming a +3 magic weapon. The club 's nail also increased punishment dispensed with additional piercing damage. When "goblin herder" landed a successful hit, it had a good chance of dazing and confusing its target.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Aptly named, Big Board with Nail was crafted by a hobgoblin chieftain named Slaul to be used as his "goblin herder" to ensure the obedience of his underlings. After some time, the club changed owners and ended up in the tiny gnome hands of Treeroot's residents. Ironically enough, the gnomes sought for an item to be used as a "goblin herder" as well. The Big Board with Nail was so successful as an anti-goblin tool, it was used as the symbol of rulership in Treeroot. Later, the club was reclaimed by goblins during a bloody raid.</p>
<p>In 1372 DR , Big Board with Nail belonged to a goblin chieftain named the Butcher . He ran the hideout in caves underneath the Wild Pastures of Liam's Hold that sheltered the orc and tanarukka army of the devil nemesis of Daggerford , Gorgomorz . The goblin leader was slain by the Hero of Daggerford the same year.</p>
