<p>Elemental handglyphs were deadly offensive handglyphs used by the Geomancers of Kadar to harness the raw power of each element.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The power of the elemental handglyph depended on the element which it harnessed. Examples of these handglyphs included a handglyph of fire , a handglyph of cold , and a handglyph of lightning . Especially deadly handglyphs of disintegration also existed.</p>
<p>These handglyphs would typically discharge the effects of a spell related to their element including fireball , cone of cold , lightning bolt , or a ray of disintegration . Their maximum range was usually 30 yards (27 meters).</p>
<p>Most elemental handglyphs had between 1—4 charges. They could be recharged, but the process for doing so was known only to a select few wizards in Rog'osto who charged handsomely for their services.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These items could be found in a variety of shapes and sizes.</p>
