<p>Nihal , sometimes called the Serpent Star , was a star-like Elder Evil from the Far Realm who had taken a place among stars of Realmspace . Unlike normal stars, Nihal didn't have a fixed place in the sky but instead danced and wavered across Realmspace.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nihal was a red star, although some stargazers said that Nihal's light was green. Nihal was actually a tear in reality composed of an infinite swarming mass of maggots and worms .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nihal, and the other Far Realm-infested stars of Realmspace, were somehow related to the Eldest .</p>
<p>Nihal writhed around the position it should hold in the sky, and because of that it was called the Serpent Star. Sometimes Nihal sent its agents to Toril , the Serpents of Nihal , to feed on living things so Nihal could sate its hunger. Some scholars believed Nihal was the brother of another elder evil, Kyuss , or even the same being observed from two different points in time.</p>
<p>Nihal was one of the stars the warlock Japheth Donard sought out in 1396 DR , after having lost his pact with the archfey Neifion .</p>
