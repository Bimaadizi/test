<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Dragon Falls began at a spring and cascaded over a bluff alongside the North Road , before joining the Fire River.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Local legend says the falls were once home to a powerful red dragon , Halarglautha Firewings , who once rampaged across the Vast and gave both Fire River and Dragon Falls their names. Halarglautha's reign of terror finally ended when she was slain by the spells of a band of human adventurers, and her lair was destroyed, along with much of her treasure.</p>
<p>However, plenty of treasure remained and the survivors took possession of the dragon's hoard of coins. They founded the nearby village of Dragon Falls with the wealth.</p>
