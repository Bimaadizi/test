<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He conspired with Galan Goadulphyn to take advantage of any chaos.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 241 DR , after Elminster Aumar was named Armathor by Coronal Eltargrim Irithyl , he met with Galan Goadulphyn somewhere in a forest. There, he suggested that Galan should take advantage of the chaos just like Athtar himself thought his house should.</p>
<p>After Delmuth Echorn lured the new Armathor away for a spell duel, Galan became concerned that their magic would bury or detonate one of his hidden caches. While heading for it, the duel ended when Delmuth Echorn's call bones spell was reflected, sending his skull out as a projectile towards Elminster, who reflected it with his shield. The cranium struck Athtar Nlossae's head, killing him instantly.</p>
