<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Relchoz was a rather short and portly human male.</p>

<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>In addition to sampling his own wears, the jolly baker often offered sample bites of his pastries to customers. Beyond the realm of bakery, however, the popularity of Hriiat Fine Pastries endowed Relchoz with such an extent of wealth that he was able to be an investor in about a fifth of all business concerns in Waterdeep that weren't exclusive to one of the city's guilds . This widespread investing went unbeknownst to most Waterdhavians.</p>
