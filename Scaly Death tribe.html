<p>The Scaly Death were a lizardfolk tribe in the Mere of Dead Men on the Sword Coast North in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 1480s DR , the bullywug leader Pharblex Spattergoo killed the leader of the Scaly Death, Suncaller , and destroyed the tribe's self-esteem in the process. Afterward, the lizardfolk entered into service to the Cult of the Dragon at Castle Naerytar . However, the Cult had also allied with bullywugs and they tormented the Scaly Death to no end, because in the alliance that the Cult made with the two groups, they gave the bullywugs the better end of the deal. However, the Scaly Death had an ally in the form of Dralmorrer Borngray , who took care of the castle where the cult operated, and paid the lizardfolk in steel weapons.</p>
