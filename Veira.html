<p>Veira was the ghostly namesake of the Weeping Widow Inn in Targos who lived sometime before the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Veira was a living woman many years before the early 14 th century DR. She was madly in love with her paramour â€“ a sailor named Donovan . One night during a deadly storm that passed the great Maer Dualdon , Donovan disappeared, leaving Veira alone and heartbroken. She hurled herself out of the window to the base of the cliff. Since then, the window has been attempted to be repaired, but eventually, the room was left untouched just as the grieving woman had left it. The lake-facing room remained locked and unused, with Veira's ghost appearing and weeping in the deepest nights.</p>
<p>The Weeping Widow Inn's innkeeper, Cahl-Hyred , paid for a protective glyph to be inscribed on the room's door to contain the restless spirit to a single room and keep her from bothering the inn's guests.</p>
<p>Veira's ghost remained in the room at least until the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR . If anyone were brave enough to talk to the spirit, she would refuse to talk to anyone but her long-lost Donovan, who promised to return to his beloved. Her entire existence was consumed by grief and hopeless stares into the broken window, waiting for Donovan's boat to make it back to the harbor.</p>
<p>Some said that the spirit found rest in 1312 DR, soon after a group of adventurers from Luskan held off a goblin invasion of Targos. The group found broken carved prow from the skiff called Veira's Gaze . The ghost's parting words were that she would see the heroes again someday in a land far away.</p>
