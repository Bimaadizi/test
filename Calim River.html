<p>The Calim River was the largest river in Calimshan . It formed the eastern border of the Calim Desert .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Its headwaters were in the western Marching Mountains . Despite its breadth, the river had a surprisingly strong current, and its waters were full of fish. South of Keltar , the river grew slow and wide until it reached the ocean at Calimport .</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>The Calim River flooded yearly, and this supply of water to the surrounding fields resulted in the most fertile farmland in all of Calimshan.</p>
<p>The town of Keltar rested alongside the river, and massive sluice gates were used to divert the water into the canals of the town. This water was used for mills and to turn giant fans to blow the smell of cattle and tanneries away.</p>
