<p>Nessie was a serving girl at the Friendly Arm Inn , who lived within the fortified caravanserai on the Sword Coast , in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nessie was a human woman with a light skin tone and blonde hair who wore a simple peasant's garb.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the time the iron crisis ravaged the Sword Coast in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Nessie had already been working for the Friendly Arm Inn for almost five years. Bentley and Gellana Mirrorshade paid Nessie to work as a waitress and a cleaner. She thought highly of her employers and was eager to greet the inn's guests, answering any of their questions about the current goings on the Friendly Arm's history, and she tended to know the inn's guests and regulars by name. During the iron crisis, Nessie was familiar with Unshey , the writer; Khalid and Jaheira , who were staying at the inn whilst waiting for a family friend to show up; Dorn Il-Khan , whom she advised guests to steer clear of; Landrin on the inn's top floor; and rowdy drunkard Tarnesh .</p>
