<p>Othea's "womb caves" were located far beneath its surface.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>

<p>After Voninheim was covered in ice, Hartkiller emerged from the caves beneath the tor, fully grown and ready to restore Ostoria .</p>
<p>In 1369 DR , Othea Tor was destroyed by Tavis Burdun using Annam's axe Sky Cleaver , so that Othea's shadow could not conceal the Bleak Palace and Twilight Vale any longer, allowing he and his companions to confront Lanaxis.</p>
