<p>Mother Night was a mysterious deity that had influence over the land of Barovia , separate from the Dark Powers of the Domains of Dread , and the vestiges of the Amber Temple .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mother Night was depicted by Barovian werewolves as a feminine figure with a wolf 's head. Such a statue would be decorated with vines and night flowers.</p>
<p>She could also be represented as a hooded figure with downturned wings.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to Barovian lore, Mother Night was originally from the mythical Four Cities , where she and other ancient gods like the Morninglord were said to have lived. This could be seen depicted on the Megaliths near Old Bonegrinder . Later, the folk of Barovia believed that she had turned away and forsaken them, and that she had sent Strahd von Zarovich as a punishment for their ancestors' misdeeds.</p>
<p>After being banished by Queen Ravenovia , Baba Lysaga offered countless sacrifices and prayed to Mother Night to harm the Queen, eventually resulting in the early death of the rival mother.</p>
<p>Madam Eva sacrificed her own youth and vitality to Mother Night in exchange for longevity and magical foresight. She used her long life to search for adventurers that could kill or redeem Strahd, her half-brother.</p>
<p>Mother Night-worshiping werewolves were sent by Strahd on raids to other worlds, emerging in the Misty Forest and predating on the farms east of Daggerford in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Mother Night was broadly respected and acknowledged by the inhabitants of Barovia, even if not actively worshiped. Her presence was most strongly felt between dusk and dawn, but even so, prayers to her seemed to go unanswered.</p>
<p>Her followers included the witch Lysaga , who was rewarded with dark powers and profane lore for her devotion. She was also served by the Children of Mother Night , a pack of werewolves who served Strahd out of the belief that he was the blessed champion of Mother Night. They maintained a shrine to their goddess in their den, consisting of a crude wooden statue decorated with vines and flowers. Rotting corpses were hung nearby as offerings, with their maggots representing Mother Night's feeding. Offerings and treasures were piled up around the statue. Mother Night would curse with nightmares anyone who dared steal valuables from her shrine, preventing them from getting any rest during the night hours.</p>
