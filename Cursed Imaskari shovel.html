<p>The cursed Imaskari shovel was an Imaskari relic unearthed from the ruins of Solon by the slaves of Ambuchar Devayam .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Whenever this shovel was touched, it teleported somewhere else in the room, leaving behind a small, mushroom-shaped fireball. The one who had touched the shovel would forevermore glow with a faint green glow; somewhere else in the room, a small cylindrical tube would begin to tick rapidly, more quickly the closer to the person who had touched the shovel, and even more quickly if pointed at them. Though there were no harmful effects, the green glow was permanent.</p>
