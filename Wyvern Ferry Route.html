<p>The Wyvern Ferry Route , or simply the Wyvern Ferry , was a ferry across the Wyvernflow River in the city of Wheloon in Cormyr . It linked the Way of the Manticore over the river.</p>
<p>Wheloon was originally a small thorp that lived off the trade of river crossings on the Wyvern Ferry. It slowly developed as trade along the Way of the Manticore increased and grew into a town based around the ferry.</p>
<p>With heavy traffic and many Whelunians owning boats, fares remained cheap. For a one-way trip, the fare was 1 copper piece per person, mount or pack animal, cart or wagon, and baggage that could not be carried in hand. The ferries ran day and night.</p>
