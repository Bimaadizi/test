<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The device consisted of cone-shaped pads for the feet and rods for the hands with pads at the bottom of those rods. It allowed the wearer to not sink in water. This worked better for lighter-weight people and supported up to 68 kilograms (150 pounds). The aqualker worked only on still water, with the inventor warning against using the device in rivers and oceans. The user moved at around 1/6th of their normal speed when using the device.</p>
