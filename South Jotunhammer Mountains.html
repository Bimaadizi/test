<p>The South Jotunhammer Mountains , sometimes considered simply the Jotunhammer Range , was a mountain range located on the island of Norland within the Moonshae Isles . They were a southern continuation of the North Jotunhammer Mountains .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The mountains covered the entire expanse of southern Norland where it jutted in between the Sea of Moonshae and Trackless Sea , measuring approximately 50 miles (80 kilometers) in length from end to end. Caverns beneath the mountains connected to the Underdark while the tops of the peaks were dominated by treacherous ancient glaciers.</p>
<p>The most notable mineral deposits of value on Norland were located in these mountains.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , a volcano in the mountains was threatening to erupt within the mountains.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Jotunhammer Mountains had long been home to giants , including frost giants who lived in seclusion in the high glaciers.</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , a large number of giants, most notably firbolgs lead by a firbolg crone named Lallargh , claimed the South Jotunhammer Mountains as their own colony of Grondsgrunn . Their presence made prospecting and mining too dangerous for the people of Norland , and many attempts by the Northlanders to oust the giants had failed over the years. The giants were supported by a clan of duergar from the Underdark.</p>
<p>The threat of a volcanic eruption in the late 15 th century DR prompted the giants and their allies to push north into the rest of Norland. At the same time, the Storm Maiden sought to rally support to drive the giants from the mountains once and for all.</p>
