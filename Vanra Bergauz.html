<p>Vanra Bergauz was the only daughter of Lora Bergauz , a retired sailor and a patron of the Blushing Mermaid in the city of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Vanra looked a lot like her mother. She was a human girl with freckled bronze skin, dark blue eyes, and red hair.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Apart from her mother, Vanra had another family member – uncle Tim Twofingers . Even if it was unclear if he was a biological uncle or Lora's friend, Tim adored young Vanra. He gifted her a copy of a book of adventures appropriately called Adventures on the Sea of Fallen Stars .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , during the time Captain Grisly was replaced by the green hag Auntie Ethel as the owner of the Blushing Mermaid, Vanra was seven years old. During one of her mother's boozy das, Vanra mysteriously disappeared. When Lora came to her senses, Vanra was missing, and everyone at the Mermaid seemed to believe that the girl never existed and Lora was there alone, meeting and drinking with friends. Distraught and desperate, Lora tried to find help, but no one believed her story. She eventually attempted to report the disappearance to Liara Portyr at the Basilisk Gate barracks. The Flaming Fist Blaze's investigation uncovered a lead. Still, when Lora arrived at the barracks, Liara Portyr seemed unable to focus on the problem and talked in circles, not willing nor able to comprehend the crime, as if some mind-magics afflicted her. She may have gotten lucky coming across the group called the Absolute Adversaries , who offered to help the distraught mother.</p>
<p>Vanra was captured by Captain Grisly, or more precisely, Auntie Ethel. The hag consumed the child in a grim act of hag procreation. The heroes could've decided to save the child and, by using the hag's bane potion , extracted the child alive and unharmed from the hag's belly. By other accords, Vanra was rescued, but the adventurers failed to save the child's life, breaking Lora's heart. And the last possibility was the "heroes" taking a grim or cruelly utilitarian approach and allowing the hag to gestate the child into a new hag in exchange for Auntie Ethel's help in defense of the Gate during the War with the Absolute .</p>
