<p>An osquip was an aggressive, multi-legged rodent about the size of a small dog.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They were hairless, with huge heads and large teeth. Most had six legs, a few had eight, and even fewer had ten. Their tails were not uniform either. They varied between no tail at all, to a stump, to a rat tail's length. Some claimed that their teeth were sharp enough to dig through stone.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>While rats normally fled anything larger than themselves, osquips proved to be both territorial and willing to attack trespassers fearlessly and ferociously. If a party entered an area where osquips made their home, the creatures emerged quickly, and a typical swarm was very damaging.</p>
<p>Unlike rats, osquips were not afraid of fire .</p>
<p>Osquips had no understanding of value but collected shiny things from time to time.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Osquips used their aforementioned teeth to fight. They had a developed sense of scent and could pinpoint creatures within 5 feet (1.5 meters) and had a general sense of direction of creatures within 30 feet (9.1 meters).</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Osquips built small, hidden tunnels. They had teeth that could be used to dig through rock. They were found either alone or in packs of two to sixteen specimens.</p>
<p>They were bad at swimming.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>On Toril , osquips were sometimes used as familiars .</p>
