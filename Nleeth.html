<p>Nleeth was a Turmish -sponsored city-state, one of the Free Cities of the Vilhon Reach , located on the northern bank of the Reach .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>A big part of Nleeth's economy was rooted in tourism. The military training and maneuvres between Chondath and Turmish attracted travelers from neighboring regions. Spectators sat back and watched armies fight for superiority without starting real wars. Even though each county sent only a small portion of their armies to participate in the tournaments, they also considered it a reconnaissance of the opponents' tactical prowess.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nleeth was established in the Year of the Bright Plumage, 320 DR , alongside the cities of Amah and Reth , to be used as training settlements for the Chondathan and Turmish armies. Nleeth was used as Turmish host, while Reth housed Chondathan troops. Amah was the neutral territory between two opponent cities. The training exercises started attracting spectators from across the Vilhon Reach, and tourism became a major part of Nleeth's economy. This led to a decrease in independent mercenaries and an increase in the city-states' and countries' internal security. With time, these armies became masters of arena combat.</p>
<p>Nleeth and its neighbors continued the tradition of the Southsands Games as of the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR . By the late 14 th century DR , most bloodshed of the Games was drastically reduced to being just accidents. These competitors had a winner. Chondath, Sespech , and Nimpeth put slaves on the stake while Turmish brought in trade goods and money. With Turmish abolishing slavery, the years when it won, the slaves were claimed from other participants and granted freedom.</p>
