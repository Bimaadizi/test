<p>Svartlebee's Woundseeker was a unique enchanted greatsword that once was famously wielded by Svartlebee the Custodian , sometime before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Woundseeker possessed a minor +1 enchantment that guided the blade towards the target and increased its deadliness. Additionally, the weapon was especially effective against opponents who had already suffered damage—each subsequent slash with the blade resulted in it deepening the wounds, in turn causing heavier damage and leaving bleeding lacerations behind.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Woundseeker belonged to Svartlebee the Custodian, a mercenary who used the weapon to remove nuisances from people's lives and cleaned up the crime scenes afterwards. Subsequently, the blade changed owners, eventually falling into the hands of the Flaming Fist Gauntlet Yeva , who accompanied Duke Ulder Ravengard on a mission to Elturel in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , and survived an attack from the Cult of the Absolute in the Waukeen's Rest roadside inn.</p>
