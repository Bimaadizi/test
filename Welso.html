<p>Welso was a deep gnome from Clan Ironhand that lived in Baldur's Gate during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>According to Meerna , Welso was a temperamental man who needed to learn to keep his anger in check were he ever to become a Burrow Warden. She also believed that he needed more training in reading the stone as Welso was "as blind as a surfacer sometimes."</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He had a sister Meerna, a deep gnome Burrow Warden, whom he cared for very much.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Welso joined Wulbren , Beldron and other Ironhand gnomes on an expedition into the ruins of Grymforge to seek out ancestral knowledge of their clan. They sought to recover any remnants or information on runepowder , a fabled substance of gnomish folklore said to have been given to the Realms by Gaerdal Ironhand himself.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, nearly every member of their group were taken captive by duergar slavers from Clan Flameshade and forced to serve as miners for the cult of the Absolute . Welso's sister Meerna became seperated from the group when the tunnel she was in collapsed. Welso was absolutely despondent when he could not contact her through the rubble and became single-minded in ensuring her rescue.</p>
