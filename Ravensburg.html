<p>Ravensburg was the capital and largest city of the Duchy of Carmathan in the Kingdom of Damara . In its capacity as the ducal seat, it was sometimes called Ravensrock .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The city served as a massive hub for the exporting of agricultural goods grown in the hugely productive fields of Carmathan. Long, squat warehouses in which the produce was stored were spread out for miles around the city center.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Ravensburg lay in the southeast of Carmathan along the Sidewinder River at the base of the Earthspur Mountains , not far north of the Earthwood forest. It sat on the King's Road , connecting it to the Arcatan capital city of Valls to the west and to the cities of Zarach , Praka , and ultimately the capital of Damara, Heliogabalus , to the east and north. The road of Dormythyrr's Ride connected the city to the Brandiar capital city of Goliad to the north.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>As the seat of the duke of Carmathan, the city was ruled directly by the Devlin family and their ducal court. Following the end of the Bloodstone Wars of 1359 DR , the ruling duke was the widely unpopular Helmont the 15th .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>In addition to serving as the primary trade hub for Carmathan's food exports, the city specialized in farming-adjacent businesses. Craftsfolk specializing in agricultural leather and metal goods comprised a bulk of the city's own trade, and each spring the city hosted a market for the famous Carmathan Horse-Ox , a massive breed of horse perfect for pulling plows.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ravensburg was the first settlement of what would become Damara. It was founded by immigrants from Sembia who arrived shortly after the Great Glacier began its retreat from the region in the Year of Spreading Spring, 1038 DR . It was the original home not only of the noble Devlin family, but also of Feldrin Bloodfeathers , who would become the first King of Damara in the Year of the Bronze Banner, 1075 DR .</p>
<p>Following the conquest of Damara by Zhengyi the Witch-King in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Ravensburg became inundated with propaganda spread by the new duke, Zhengyi's puppet Dashard Devlin . Even after Dashard's death in the Bloodstone Wars two years later, this misinformation made the people of Ravensburg largely indifferent or hostile to the efforts of Gareth Dragonsbane to unify Damara. The city became inundated with intrigue and rumors as agents of both Gareth and of his rival for the Damaran throne, Dimian Ree , infiltrated the city to try and muster support for their preferred ruler. Ultimately, Gareth would win out, and be named King of Damara in the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR . At the same time, questions had arisen about the legitimacy of the current duke, Dashard's self-proclaimed long-lost brother Theodorus Devlin , and the city played host to monks of the Monastery of the Yellow Rose investigating the duke's genealogy.</p>
