<p>Korai Anteki was a machi-yakko leader in Wa around 1357 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Anteki was the son of Korai Urushi , a modest rice merchant in Iiso . However, when Anteki was young, customers mysteriously stopped going to his father's shop. Ruined, Urushi sold his business to Osahichiro Yoto , Iiso's largest rice trader.</p>
<p>Anteki became convinced that the ruining of his father's business was a government plot and joined a machi-yakko group. In time, he became the leader of the group thanks to his skills and started a private war against the local businessmen, especially Yoto.</p>
