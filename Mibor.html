<p>Mibor was a chieftain of the Far Quey tribe of Nar in Narfell as of 1373Â DR . He was hulking, with a coarse face, and had a voice as deep as Dorn Graybrook 's.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On Eleint 7 , Mibor and his war party came across Taegan Nightwind and Jivex . They attempted to slay them, but the two foreigners just barely escaped. Later, the war party was entranced by the song dragon Karasendrieth ; opportunistically attacked by the vampiric dragon Brimstone , they broke from the spell and attacked. They only broke from the attack once her party drove off the undead smoke drake , and offered their help in healing its victims.</p>
