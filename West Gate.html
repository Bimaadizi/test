<p>The West Gate was the western point of entrance and exit through the Trollwall into and out of Waterdeep , the City of Splendors, as well as the least used of the city's four gates.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The gate featured two towers, both standing three stories tall. It was comparatively smaller than the city's other gates.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The West Gate was found in western Waterdeep, in the southwest section of the Sea Ward , and opened on to Seas' Edge Beach and the Mud Flats .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Like other gates, members of the City Guard were stationed at West Gate, though by contrast there were no magisters stationed at it. Locals were required to register with the stationed Guardsmen prior to exiting and entering, though any new arrivals that attempted to enter the city through West Gate would be turned away.</p>
<p>Prior to the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , as a defensive measure one of the Walking Statues of Waterdeep was stationed beneath the West Gate and hidden away on the Ethereal plane . It actively defended against ethereal intrusion, attacking any ethereal creatures it perceived within Waterdeep's bounds, but would ignore ethereal humanoids unless there was a group of ten or more of them. In 1385 DR, it and six of the other hidden Walking Statues exited the Ethereal plane and left their positions to rampage across the city.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The West Gate was typically used by various sorts of fishermen, from those who fished from shore to those who went out with nets or traps, as well as clam diggers and the occasional bather. It also saw annual use on Auril's Blesstide by the foot-race known as "Cliffs Run".</p>
