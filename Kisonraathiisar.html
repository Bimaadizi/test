<p>Kisonraathiisar was a topaz dragon and the first king of Westgate . He founded Westgate in an effort to build a kingdom that would survive the effects of the King-Killer Star .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He was slowly destroyed by Saldrinar "of the Seven Spells", a Netherese wizard, in −349 DR . Saldrinar then became the first human king of Westgate. Some believed that Kisonraathiisar was trapped within an enchanted scepter so that Saldrinar could conjure Kisonraathiisar's spells at will.</p>
<p>Kisonraathiisar's corpse was kept in a secret subbasement below Castle Thalavar in Westgate. Early in his reign, Orlak took a large chunk of bone from the skeleton of Kisonraathiisar and from it carved a special chalice. With unholy incantations of necromancy , Orlak enchanted this as the Argraal of Orlak .</p>
<p>Long after his death, a large stature (not to scale), was erected in Westgate to commemorate the creation of the city and its first draconic king. The statue depicted Kisonraathiisar as a fierce red dragon and was placed in the Harbor Loop with a plaque that named the creature, his death date, and his slayer – Saldrinar. As of the late 14 th century DR, the stature to Kisonraathiisar stood unvandalized.</p>
