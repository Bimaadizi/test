<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Perendra was the daughter of Lady Saylayne and Baron Amir Raslemtar , one of only five barons to survive the Ten Black Days of Eleint . She was also raised in her later teenage years by Alustriel Silverhand .</p>
<p>Perendra had a long relationship with Lord Zelphar Thann , originally from Waterdeep and later a count of Tethyr. The two were introduced by future king Haedrak . The courtship progressed slowly, because both nobles were overworked and timid.</p>
<p>Perendra was a tutor to Geiron Hawkwinter , nephew of Countess Kyrin Hawkwinter .</p>
<p>Perendra's magical familiar was an owl, but she was also friends with a ki-rin named Harnoster , whom she met while in Silverymoon with Alustriel. The latter of the two often reported to her news of what was occuring across the North.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1347 DR , as the young daughter of the last baron of Elemetar (it was a barony before the Interregnum , ) she was exiled voluntarily with her father and family from Tethyr on a ship to Baldur's Gate From there, they traveled to Waterdeep , where Perendra spent most of her childhood.</p>
<p>When she was only fourteen-years-old, her parents were killed by assassins who had tracked them from Tethyr. She was taken by Mirt "the Moneylender" to Alustriel who raised her into adulthood in her palace in Silverymoon. Under Alustriel's tutelage, she grew in her magical arts.</p>
<p>A few years before 1357 DR , Perendra took her leave of her foster mother Alustriel, moved to Voonlar , bought and built her Stronghold , and joined the Harpers, whom she had always respected.</p>
<p>In 1368 DR , in the month of Eleasis , when Elminster sent Lhaeo through a portal to Voonlar, the lost prince met Perendra and found his first ally in her.</p>
<p>The two of them traveled by magic to Silverymoon after a few tendays , and there they planned with Alustriel and Khelben "Blackstaff" how Lhaeo might be made King Haedrak III and return to Tethyr. After that, the two traveled to Waterdeep to gain further support.</p>
<p>Near the end of the war, when Zaranda Star was a prisoner in Shoonach , Prince Haedrak tasked Perendra, Vajra Valmeyjar , Onyx the Invincible , and Ondul Jarduth with teleporting into Myratma and freeing the slaves there in an attempt at a distraction so the prince could rescue Zaranda. They succeeded at rescuing the slaves and performed many acts of sabotage, such as fouling the water supplies and food sources of the city and weakening the walls with magic. After avoiding detection successfully, they escaped from the city by leaping from the walls into the river and swimming to join the rest of the Loyalist army.</p>
<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>Her romance with Lord Zelphar Thann was a common topic of gossip, as was her appointment to the position of vizera. In the latter case, it was bothersome to many upper-class Tethyrians that Perendra was appointed instead of Duchess-Consort Lawantha Blackthorn , who was higher-ranked as a duchess and a more powerful wizardess. However, Lawantha was a Calishite by birth, while Perendra was Tethyrian . Moreover, Perendra was Prince Haedrak's first ally and had saved the future king and queen's lives on multiple occasions.</p>
