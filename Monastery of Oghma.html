<p>This building was a small monastery in the Gulthmere Forest , dedicated to the worship of the deity Oghma , in the 12 th to 14 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Tardy Guests, 1146 DR , an Oghmanyte priest by the name of Amanlas Hulther had discovered small mimics within an ancient, dried-out well behind the monastery. He began to experiment on the creatures and prayed to his deity for guidance on what to do with them. Over the next two decades he came to control them through a strict regimen of punishment and food incentives, until eventually he bred them.</p>
<p>Amanlas went on to show his work with the mimics to his superiors at the monastery. With their support, he spent another two decades breeding the mimics to have certain traits, culminating in what became known as a book mimic , a creature bred for the purpose of guarding the tomes in Oghmanyte libraries. In the Year of the Arcane Guise, 1187 DR , the now elderly Amanlas sent word of his achievement the highest-ranking Oghmanyte priests that he could.</p>
<p>Sometime in the late 1300s DR , this monastery was destroyed and by the next century almost no traces of it remained.</p>
