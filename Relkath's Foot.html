<p>Relkath's Foot was the largest permanent settlement inside the Yuirwood , and the unofficial half-elven capital of the Yuirwood.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A number of the city's inhabitants made their homes on wooden platforms hanging on the massive trees and the surrounding forest, strung together by a complex web of ropes and suspension bridges, on which outsiders were rarely permitted.</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>Relkath was built around four tall, majestic trees that rose more than 100 feet (30 meters) from the canopy. The Greenborn River snaked around the north side of the city, splitting off a small segment that was accessible only through two fords.</p>
<p>By 1479 DR , Relkath's Foot was on the coast, though the city remained mostly unchanged.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The government was mostly under the control of the local princess Blindelsyn Olóssyne , who oversaw most government activities in the city. Blindelsyn's brother, Branelwyr ruled in her absence and had a seat at the Royal Council. However, Melordianix , the matriarch of the local song dragons , wielded significant power.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Relkath's Foot was more of a center of occassional trade and lorekeeping than actual commerce, with local hunters bringing their kills to barter. However, some of the most skilled woodworkers and bowmakers in Aglarond kept homes in the town. Travelers were welcome so long as they were respectful of the locals' way of life.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Many inhabitants of Relkath's Foot stayed on the ground, constantly looking out for invaders. The song dragons kept a watch for threats from the air. The Masters of the Yuirwood were headquartered there as well, and the rangers of Relkath's Foot, many of which were also Masters of the Yuirwood, were legendary in their skills.</p>
<p>The town guard consisted of 49 members, while the militia boasted 254 members.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The four trees at the center of the city were said to have sprung from the buried foot of Relkath of the Infinite Branches , who was said to be sleeping under the soil until he was needed again.</p>
<h2>Places of Worship</h2>
<p>Smaller shrines to Corellon Larethian and Silvanus existed closer to town, though many members of the Elven pantheon were represented. The Temple of Corellon was north of the Greenborn River.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h3>Merchants' Square</h3>
<p>There was a square set up for merchants on the ground near the four trees.</p>
<h3>Menhir Circle</h3>
<p>One menhir circle was just outside the city; the Masters of the Yuirwood could use it to arrive anywhere in the Yuirwood within a day.</p>
<h3>Masters' Hall</h3>
<p>The headquarters of the Masters of the Yuirwood was amongst the structures on one of the trees in Relkath's Foot.</p>
<h3>Royal Hall</h3>
<p>The Royal Hall was a structure made entirely out of enchanted live wood, with a leafy throne magically covered in everblooming flowers. The entire structure was at the highest branch of the four trees at the center of town.</p>
<h3>Song Dragon Aerie</h3>
<p>There was a family of song dragons living close by: two mature adults and two young dragons. They lived in the only location in the region that was higher than the Royal Hall.</p>
<h3>House of the Leaflord</h3>
<p>The House of the Leaflord was a tree-shaded glen 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from the town that was dedicated to Rillifane Rallathil , and it was amongst his largest temples; the druid Ilmiryl Oakheart watched over it.</p>
<h3>Green Man Inn</h3>
<p>The Green Man Inn bore only a single common room. The inn was north of the Greenborn River. Its rootweal was a local specialty, highly recommended, though sometimes unsuitable for non-elves. The stablishment carried numerous tall-stemmed goblets.</p>
<p>By 1375 DR , the Green Man had moved to the north side of the square, opposite the Taproot. They did not serve tea.</p>
<h3>The Taproot</h3>
<p>The Taproot Inn boasted a first-class alehouse and private rooms, which attracted more outsiders than the Green Man Inn. Regulars at both inns often competed for sport. Such activities, as of 1479 DR , included climbing a greased tree, rolling logs, and running or breath-holding competitions; the inn's owners could find room for those participating even if the inn was full.</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>In 1375 DR , an attack on Stardeep was decided at Relkath's Foot after learning of their destruction of a half-elf encampment.</p>
<p>In 1479 DR , a Thayan lich named Voldini was shut out of an island north of Relkath's Foot, where she was operating, by adventurers.</p>
