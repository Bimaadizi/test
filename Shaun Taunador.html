<p>Shaun Taunador was one of the primary mind flayer merchants of Ch'Chitl in 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Shaun originated when an illithid tadpole was implanted in the body of a quaggoth shaman ; this rare choice for a host stemmed from a time when there were lack of more suitable hosts. However, Shaun possessed incredible psychic powers and was a giant among illithid kind.</p>
<p>Shaun Taunador became one of the Skullport 's primary sellers of illicit substances, usually potions, painkillers, and poisons. Although it conducted business from a barge moored at the docks or from rented rooms in Skullport, and most thought it dwelled there, in truth it teleported home to Ch'Chitl every day after finishing work.</p>
