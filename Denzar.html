<p>Denzar was a frontier mining town in Gauros tharch of Thay , in the north-eastern region of the nation.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Denzar was a grim settlement shrouded by a constant flow of sulfurous smoke from its wood-fueled smelters. Most structures in the town were rubblestone-walled buildings. Beasts of burden â€“ oxen and mules were used to cart ore and wood in support of the mining industry.</p>
<p>The town's inhabitants were hard-working, and harder-drinking outcasts, misfits, and half-bloods hired to work in the smelters. The workers' injuries were magically healed when they were hurt. The mining and smelter folk were strong and hardened, tough enough to take on a Thayan veteran bare-handed, downing them with a single punch or rip apart Thayan undead servants with relative ease.</p>
<p>Red Wizards, nobles, wealthy, or snobbish folk were sullenly disliked in Denzar.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Denzar stood in the foothills of the Sunrise Mountains , on the northern shores of the River Gauros , past a bridge across it, along the road that connected Gauros Keep to the north and Chur Gathos to the southeast in the Daggertooth Pass . Denzar was the easternmost endpoint of the Sur Road .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Denzar served as a supply and processing center for the many Thayan mines scattered in the Sunrise Mountains. The town provided the miners with food, equipment, mules, and other supplies. Its smelters processed copper , with some lead , silver , and occasional gold .</p>
