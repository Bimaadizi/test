<p>Divisav Irithyl was the first son of Kahvoerm Irithyl and the second of the family line to attempt to draw the Rulers' Blade and become the Coronal of Cormanthyr in −2900 DR . Unlike his father and all of his line to follow, Divisav failed on account of his greed and was consumed by the elfblade . He died instantly in a bout of arcane green fire. The blade was thus passed to Kahvoerm's youngest great-grandson, Sakrattars Irithyl , who become second Coronal.</p>
