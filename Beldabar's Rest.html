<p>Beldabar's Rest was an underground inn located in the city of Yartar in the 1360s DR . Owned and run by the man it was named after, Beldabar Yarryn , the inn was a busy but discreet establishment that was favored by gamblers and adventurers .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The inn was found in an unconventional location, beneath Yartar's central market.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Beldabar's structure was unique, comprising the cellars of several warehouses located around the city's market. These cellars were renovated to serve as the inn's boarding rooms. Its unique structure led to a very strict "no fires" policy.</p>
<p>The inn's stables could be accessed by a dirt ramp that led down from a nearby gatehouse.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Each guest room had a heavy bar that patrons could use to lock the door. Unknown to most guests was that each room had at least two secret entrances. The hidden passages of the Rest led to various locations around and beneath Yartar.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>Beldabar's Rest was dimly lit by a number of driftglobes that shone with earth-tone hues.</p>
<p>It was a place of discretion and security. Each of the inn's rooms held a gong made of bronze , which served as an alarm system that would summon guards.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>While the only wine available in Beldabar's was sloegreen wine , truly an acquired taste, the food was quite delectable. It offered foot-long lamb sausages for 3 cp ; skewered chicken hearts, for 6 sp apiece, and steak, mushroom, and kidney pie for 9 sp per pie.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Most of the patrons in Beldabar's openly wielded weapons and many of its staff members were former adventurers.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>One of the inn's secret tunnels led to the Kissing Court in eastern Yartar.</p>
<p>The caverns beneath the cellars were rumored to lead to the Underdark , and were home to an alhoon and a family of wererats .</p>
