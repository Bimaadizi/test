<p>The Dragon's Teeth Lagoon was the body of water between the "jaws" of the Dragon's Head Peninsula , the westernmost part of the Tethyr Peninsula .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Dragon's Teeth Lagoon was a peaceful inlet in the Trackless Sea and bordering Asavir's Channel to the north. Its name was insured by the shape of the peninsula rather than any sort of draconic activity in the area. The shoreline of the Dragon's Teeth Lagoon was known as the Bite and was the location of forty abandoned villas and manors abandoned during the Ten Black Days of Eleint of the Year of the Bright Blade, 1347 DR . The manors were looted, ravaged, and burned by the angry mobs, and their inhabitants â€“ slaughtered. However, some of the villas were still in use and heavily guarded in the late 14 th century DR. Whether used by their rightful owners or not remained a mystery. The Firedrake Road hugged the Dragon's Head coastline and passed the abandoned mansions overlooking the Dragon's Teeth Lagoon. On rare occasions, ships were ween dropping anchors by some of the villas still in use, and heavily guarded companies prevented anyone from straying off the Firedrake Road along the Lagoon's shores.</p>
<h2>Climate</h2>
<p>The Tethyr Peninsula was known for its fierce winters. The elements and water freezing in the ruined mansions' walls often caused collapses, exposing more and more of their interior with each passing season.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>With the death of the inhabitants of the villas on the Bite, the only known dwellers of the area were ghosts that haunted the ruins of their old homes.</p>
