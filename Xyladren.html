<p>Xyladren was one of the Six Holy Cities of the ixitxachitl nation in the Sea of Fallen Stars known as the Xedran Reefs .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like all of the 'chitl cities, Orilidren consisted of a huge warren of tunnels and subcaverns. This included a central entrance to the surface, with passages riddled in traps, that above on the ocean floor was marked by a ruin nestled between a ring of nine hills. Beneath that site was a large cavern with a great temple to Ilxendren , around which the rest of the city grew outward from.</p>
<p>There stood an outbuilding near the temple for the Devitan's personal slaves , at least four caverns on the outskirts of the city in which other slaves were kept, two military garrisons, and at least four public shrines on the city outskirts that were deciated to Ilxendren.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Around the 14 th century DR this city was led by Devitan Rialapar .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Xyladren was considered to be one of the strongest of the Six Holy Cities due to its easily defensible position. The city's entrance allowed the ixitxachitl inhabitants to swarm invaders from both.</p>
