<p>Flaming Gullet was a spicy mixed alcoholic beverage that was served in inns and taverns across the Realms during the 14 th century DR , such as the Hidden Lady .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Flaming Gullet drink was an amber-hued mixed drink. Its ingredients were carefully measured and consisted of klaraunth (a strong and clear distilled barley alcoholic beverage from Tethyr , Chessenta , or the Vilhon ), a distillate of hot red radishes , a distillate of horseradish , and finely crushed and powdered chestnuts .</p>
<p>The drink was never to be served flaming, oftentimes contradicting tall-tales and boasts heard in taverns across Faerûn.</p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>The name of the drink was a description of what the imbiber was to expect from consuming a flaming gullet. The fiery hot drink caused th sensation of searing fire in the drinker's throat and cleared any and all congestion the drinker could have been suffering from.</p>
