<p>Roq Silent Hunter was a river-dwelling caiman katanga hunter from the jungles of the Malatran Plateau active in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Roq was not particularly smart and the only topic he showed interest in was hunting.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR , the Tribe of the Wise Ones became aware of a looming threat. The leader of the dreaded spider katanga , the Mother of a Thousand Young , was swollen with a thousand children ready to overflow the jungles. In preparation for the birthing, she initiated a ritual that sent deadly poisons into the rivers cascading off the Fire Mountain . Roq was among the younger and less-experienced heroes of the Living Jungle who answered the call. Silent Hunter's group was sent to enter the spider katanga caverns and faced hunting spider katangas who guarded previously captured adventurers.</p>
<p>It was unknown if Roq survived the battle, but the Mother of a Thousand Young was defeated, and heroes returned to the Village of the Wise Ones for their reward and facilitated the clean-up and nature's healing.</p>
