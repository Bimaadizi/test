<p>The Order of the Even-Handed was a monastic order based in Waterdeep , dedicated to the tenets of Tyr .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>A relatively small organization, the Order consisted of monks, clerics , sacred fists , and fighters , all devoted worshipers of Tyr. The Order was based around Hlam 's Way of the Sacred Fists , a monastic discipline that combined elements of cleric and monk training.</p>
<p>Although Hlam was Grand Master of the Order of the Even-Handed, he had little involvement with the organization, though he viewed it favorably.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Even-Handed taught its members self-reliance, and bade them seek out injustice. Membership was open to most, as long as they had some talent at unarmed combat and swore vows of impartiality and devotion to Tyr.</p>
<p>It was expected that each member embark alone on a grand, Tyr-sanctioned adventure in their lifetime. Most members also sought to defeat monks of Helm in ritual combat.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Order was based out of the House of Two Hands , a remote villa overlooking Smuggler's Bay from the slopes of Mount Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Hammer Lord Hykros Allumen , leader of the Church of Tyr in Waterdeep, deeply disapproved of the Order's mixing of monk and cleric traditions. Therefore, the Order of the Even-Handed had closer ties to—and paid their tithes to—the Hall of Justice in Neverwinter .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Order of the Even-Handed was formed in the 14 th century DR by disciples of Hlam, a reclusive monk who resided in a cave on Mount Waterdeep. Over the years, Hlam taught many students, who eventually organized themselves into the Order of the Even-Handed, receiving financial backing from Piergeiron the Paladinson to purchase a villa near Hlam's cave.</p>
