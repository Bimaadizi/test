<p>Izzinid Claddafin was a scholastic Eilistraean drow of Eilistraee's Wanderers in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Izzinid had thick white hair kept tied back, and wore a green outfit.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the well-educated Izzinid followed Kelgoth Darksong joined the Elves of Cormanthor at Myth Drannor , following Kelgoth's aim of restoring the mythal . They stayed at the fortified camp nearby, but the surfacer elves were both distrustful and paternalistically protective of the drow, and refused to help them go into the ruins. Frustrated by this, Kelgoth, Zelliira , and Uhlsdrin Nirveth went into the ruins on their own to find the three Icons that would unlock the Key to the Mythal , only to quickly run into trouble. With the prompting of Aelorin Ungive , the elves and their allies set about helping the drow and finishing their quest, eventually finding all three of the Icons. For the final stage of the plan, Izzinid organized an expedition into the ruins of Ildrannath's Tower , where the Key to the Mythal was supposed to be kept. Although it was indeed there, it was ultimately stolen by the forces of the Red Wizard Droic Orgul ―sent from Thay to raid and loot the ruins of Myth Drannor—prompting a short struggle between the elves and Red Wizards over the fate of the city.</p>
