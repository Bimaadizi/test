<p>The Rangewatchers were an adventuring company.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1335 DR , the Rangewatchers battled a red dragon that was marauding against villages in the area. During the battle, three Rangewatchers were killed and Montolio Debrouchee 's face was melted. Montolio's skin was restored by healers, but his sight never returned. He felt pitied by his companions, so he retreated to an area later known as " Mooshie's Grove " to die. However, he found new life in gaining new skills through his senses other than sight.</p>
