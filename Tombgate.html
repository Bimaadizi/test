<p>In 1357Â DR , Tessaril Winter took Shandril Shessair and Narm Tamaraith through the portal in disguise. They arrived at Tsarn Tombs near Scornubel, atop a hill, within sight of a road leading to a ferry.</p>
<p>The portal was known to the Zhentarim scriers Korthauvar Hammantle and Hlael Toraunt , who, by eavesdropping on a group of Highknights , confirmed Tessaril had went with two people through a portal, and sent a skull-token elsewhere. The portal was already known to them to have been used by Tessaril and two companions.</p>
<p>Tessaril later informed Lhaeo which portal she used and sent a skull token that would teleport one to the same location.</p>
