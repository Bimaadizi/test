<p>Raerlin was a Calishite human and briefly, apprentice to Elminster , until he stole a key to a container of old spellbooks in Elminster's tower . Later, he became a lich , but Elminster assumed that he had been eaten by a dragon .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Elminster recovered the key to his door in the Year of the Highmantle, 1336 DR , Raerlin opened a gateway directly into Elminster's tower (which was magically protected) and attacked Elminster and Storm Silverhand . He drained Elminster's magical energy to power his own, and in doing so, defeated Elminster. Storm noticed that one of the books in the room was glowing in a similar way to the lich's gate, and burned it. The book was Raerlin's phylactery and Raerlin was destroyed. Elminster recovered without serious harm.</p>
