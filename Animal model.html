<p>Animal models , also referred to as rolling animals , wheeled animal models , or pull toys were toy wood carvings of animals on wheeled platforms with a string to pull them along.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Animal models could be carved to resemble all manner of animals, as well as some monsters. They typically measured 12 feet (3.7 meters) in length, 12 ft (3.7 m) tall, and weighed 5 lb (2.3 kg). Internal hinges were used in their crafting that enabled their tails to move, as well as their mouths to open and close, as the models were moved along the ground. Some, like those modeled on a wyvern , had hinged wings that would flap as they were moved.</p>
<p>Animal models that were referred to as "pull toys" had a string attached to them, allowing them to be pulled across the ground.</p>
