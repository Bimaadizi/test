<p>Abyssal sparks were elementals of fire from the Abyss .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They looked like bright bursts of Abyssal flame that had come to life. They flew and flitted about—like the sparks emerging from a fire—by emitting a pulse of flame from their bodies.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Abyssal sparks could use their pulsing fire to burn their foes. They were delicate and easy to destroy, but this led them to immolate in a fiery explosion. Any demon caught in this burst found itself briefly shielded from any incoming attacks, and so abyssal sparks made a point of staying nearby their demonic allies in combat.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Sparks had been encountered in swarms and alongside demons. They were known to emerge from portals to the Abyss.</p>
