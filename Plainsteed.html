<p>Plainsteeds were a special and highly prestigious breed of magnificent horses from the cities of the Shining Plains : Assam , Lheshayl , and Ormath .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The horses of the Shining Plains were renowned across the Vilhon Reach for their stamina, speed, strength, and endurance. Those individuals who owned a Plainsteed were considered to be people of great importance, even outside of the Vilhon Reach and the Shining Plains.</p>
<p>Plainsteeds came in two weight groups, light war Plainsteeds, and medium war Plainsteeds. Each Plainsteed was of greater value than other horses, usually going for 75 gold pieces or more.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Plainsteeds were bred primarily in the cities of Lheshayl and Ormath, with Lheshayl being the biggest producer. The creatures were kept in small herds. The horses resided outside the city and were tended by guards and trainers. Human breeders of the Shining Plains kept each herd safe from hungry predators and bandits, and stopped them from intermingling with other groups of Plainsteeds.</p>
<p>Stealing a Plainsteed was a capital offense in the Shining Plains and was punishable by death.</p>
<p>Plainsteeds were considered a delicacy among local thri-kreen of the Rushing Hills .</p>
<p>In Sespech , Plainsteeds were used in celebrations of the Feast of Purple Majesty . The part of the celebration that involved them was called the Dawn of Equines , during which Plainsteeds were adorned with expensive polished barding and were used in jousting and racing.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR , Plainsteeds could be found exported as far from the Shining Plains as the city-state of Hlondeth and Riatavin , along the Pikemen's Folly . The further away from the Shining Plains one found a Plainsteed the more expensive its price was.</p>
