<p>Don Juan Montery was an infamous adventuring knight of the Golden Rooster order from the city of Ravens Bluff , active in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Don Juan was a fair-haired man of, allegedly, noble Cimbarian blood.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Don Juan Montery swiftly advanced in rank among the Knights of the Golden Rooster within a single year. His adventures brought the knight to the attention of Jacinth "Jackie" Moonspring , the Society Editor of the Ravens Bluff Trumpeter broadsheet . However, it was Don Juan's sexual conquests that earned him an appearance in Jacinth's column. The Society Editor speculated that Don Juan Montery must've lost a bet because he was seen frolicking with Vedina Stareye , a woman with pox -scarred face and a voice that sounded like fingernails scratching slate . Within one month, Montery was seen in the company of other ladies of the Bluff: the half-elven scout named Opal Starlight and a handsome paladin of Tyr , Yvonne Chantel . Interestingly enough, Yvonne claimed to have had never been with the "Chicken Knight" herself. The latest conquest, or maybe, a target of Montery's attention, was a fellow Knight of the Golden Roosterâ€” Ladyhawke . Jackie Moonspring also noted that it was unknown if Don Juan and Ladyhawke would ever get close as the man was an infantry member, while Ladyhawke served as a city walls guardswoman.</p>
