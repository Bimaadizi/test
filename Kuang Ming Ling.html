<h2>History</h2>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Kuang Ming was the daughter of Kao Ling , a wealthy merchant of Linshung, who hoped her dream of being a shukenja would just be a passing interest. She traveled with two korobokuru retainers of her father, Hsiao Nan Tzu Wen and Ling Yu Pao , to travel with her and protect her. While Hsiao encouraged Kuang to visit inns, wine shops, and the like, Yu Pao advised caution and returning home, which aggravated the headstrong young woman.</p>
