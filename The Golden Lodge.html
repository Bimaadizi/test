<p>The Golden Lodge was a small shrine dedicated to the Merchant's Friend, the goddess Waukeen , located in Lonelywood , one of the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Golden Lodge stood close to the center of the settlement, just east of a well and south of the Weeping Willow Inn .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The shrine was a simple wooden structure that consisted of two square sections connected by an elongated hallway. Like many other buildings in Lonelywood, The Golden Lodge was built on stilts, elevated over the frozen soil with a single stair leading toward its entrance.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The temple opened up into a small square chamber, lavishly decorated by Lonelywood's standards. The entrance was followed by a carpeted walkway across a tiny pool with statues of Waukeen on each side, depicting the goddess as a beautiful young woman with an outstretched arm. A decorative railing encircled the pool, and the chamber's floors and walls were tiled. The shrine's altar stood in the northern corner of the room. To its right was a long passageway with a red and black rug along its length that led to the priest's quarters hidden behind a curtain.</p>
<p>The cleric's quarters was a square room of the same size as the shrine with wooded floors and a single rug near the fireplace. Its walls held bookshelves stuffed to the brim with books on the topic of trade and commerce, and the room's furnishing consisted of a desk, comfy chair, and a large bed.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The shrine offered the usual array of clerical services: healing, priestly spells and rituals, as well as some mercantile activities. The temple dealt with potions and some enchanted items available in exchange for a generous donation. Tymoran magic oil of second chances was one of the temple's most notable consumables. Magic items available there included Waukeen's Defender shield , the kinetic spear created by Giddeon the Believer , an Ilmatari Three White Doves mace , the Flail of Mae , ancient Amaunator's Legacy , the nihilistic weapon called the Inconsequence , exotic Sarutobi's Stone Breakers from Shou Lung , and Mulhorandi scarab of goodwill .</p>
<p>In addition to the priestly and mercantile activities, The Golden Lodge performed tasks common for the clergy of Waukeen â€“ it maintained relations with the crafters and artisans of Lonelywood, monitored trade, and aided upstart businesses and exporters.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The temple was established by Grand Syndar Quinn Silverfinger of Goldspires in Athkatla sometime before the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR . Another notable member of the clergy who served under Quinn was Nolan the Healer who served the church at The Golden Lodge until he was shipped to Targos as a "penance" for greed running too thickly in Nolan's blood. He was tasked with establishing new trade with Lonelywood and traveled to other settlements in the area, trying to convert drunks and barbarians into the Waukenaar faith. In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , Nolan of The Golden Lodge joined the Targos Guard as a healer to aid the town against the attacks of the Legion of the Chimera that plagued the region.</p>
<p>Aged Quinn Silverfinger remained in charge of the temple as late as the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR .</p>
