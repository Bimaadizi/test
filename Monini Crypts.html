<p>The Monini Crypts was a mausoleum in which the Monini family of Neverwinter were interred.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Crypt was located in the Craftsman's Rest area of Neverwinter's Neverdeath Graveyard . Following the great upheavals of the land during the Ruining , access to the Crypts was difficult and required finding and traversing a tunnel through the cliffs.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , members of the Cult of the Dragon entered the Monini Crypts in search of the knowledge to gain access to Azharzel , a blue dragon sealed within the Waterclock Guild's Crypts long before by Romani Monini . At that same time, Romani's descendant, Zami Monini , entered the crypt alongside scholar Tristopher Chettlebell to learn more about her family history. The pair were attacked by the Cultists, who captured Zami and locked her in a sarcophagus . Meanwhile, Tristopher escaped and, confused about the cultists' motivations after no ransom demands were made, sought help from an adventurer to rescue Zami.</p>
