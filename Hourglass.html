<p>Hourglasses , also known as sandglasses or sand-clocks , were a type of tool used for tracking the passage of time. They typically tracked the passage of one or more hours, hence their name, though some known as minuteglasses were designed to track specific minute timeframes.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>An hourglass consisted of two bulbous, glass globes connected by a narrow passage. These globes were held together by a frame, typically made of wood, that itself was held together by twine and screws . The glass globes were filled with sand that traveled from the topmost bulb to the lower one, passing through the narrow passage that connected them.</p>

<p>Throughout the 14 th century DR , Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue offered one and two hour sandglasses, as well as minuteglasses that counted intervals of ten minutes, five minutes, one minute, and a half-minute.
