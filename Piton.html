<p>A piton , also called a spike , was a tool that could be wedged into a crevice of a rock in order to support a climber.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Pitons were specialized iron or steel spikes with an eyehole for attaching a rope , carabiner , or other device.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>In order to be effective, pitons had to be hammered into the surfaces of walls so that they were secure. They were used in combination with ropes, which were connected to the climber's body. If used correctly, pitons would shorten the distance that one would fall, should they accidentally slip. These simple tools were used across Faerûn , Maztica , and even other locations across Realmspace .</p>
<p>As large and durable metal nails , pitons could also be used by adventurers to spike a door shut.</p>
