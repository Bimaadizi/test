<p>The Blood Skulls , also called the Bloody Skulls and previously the Black Spears , were a powerful orc tribe in Thar from the late 14 th through late 15 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Blood Skulls were based out of Bloodskull Keep , a stronghold located in central Thar northwest of Bloodmuck . It was named in honor of the tribe's tradition of painting the skulls of fallen enemies and comrades red and mounting them in the keep's great hall. The collection was said to include hundreds of human , dwarf , and orc skulls, as well as prominently displayed giantkin and wyvern specimens.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Blood Skull tribe was originally known as the Black Spear tribe, which was led by shamans of Gruumsh and was named in honor of their god's favored weapon, The Bloodspear . It was one of the more fearsome orc clans in Thar as of the late 14 th century DR when the upstart half-orc warchief Wertha rallied most of the tribe's warriors and overthrew the shamans in Bloodskull Keep . The tribe then became embroiled in a civil war for many years between Wertha's faction in Bloodskull Keep, calling themselves the Bloody Skulls, and the Gruumshites based in the tribe's outlying strongholds. While this infighting weakened the tribe's influence significantly, Wertha eventually wrested full control away from the Gruumshites and restored the clan to its former glory.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the Blood Skull tribe led a horde of orcs, hobgoblins , and ogres , bolstered by manticores and wyverns , to destroy the town of Glister and attack the city of Hulburg . They were defeated at the Battle of Lendon's Dike after their leader, Mhurren , was killed. Their defeat created a power vacuum among the monstrous tribes of Thar, leading to fighting between dozens of lesser tribes of orcs, goblinoids , and giantkin who rushed to assert dominance.</p>
<p>Secretly, this invasion had been made possible by Kardhel Terov of the Warlock Knights of Vaasa , who had helped to bring together and equip the Blood Skulls' coalition. His goal had been to secure access to the Moonsea for Vaasa .</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The orcs of the tribe were highly religious, having strong ties to clerics of the orc pantheon . The tribe was known to honor strength above all, and it was not uncommon for half-orcs to rise to power within the ranks if they demonstrated their skill in battle.</p>
