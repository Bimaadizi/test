<p>The Corsair Domains consisted of a number of small islands in the Great Sea off the northern coast of Zakhara . They were the holdouts of the pirates in this region, and the different areas, villages, and hiding-places in the Corsair Domains were ruled by whichever brigand or former captain could grab power. The only real city here, Hawa , was no exception.</p>
<p>Despite this anarchic bent, most inhabitants claimed overall loyalty to the Grand Caliph and the Law of the Loregiver . In contrast to most of Zakhara , slavery was despised by the corsairs , possibly in part because the mamluks of Qudra were their greatest enemies.</p>
<p>Unlike the Nelanther in the Trackless Sea near Amn and the Pirate Isles of old in the Inner Sea , piracy was not the main activity, though it was an important one. Much of the corsairs' plundering was directed toward the north, considered barbaric by Zakharans in general. Ship-building, smuggling, adventuring, and trade were other important ways of income.</p>
