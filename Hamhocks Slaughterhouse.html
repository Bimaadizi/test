<p>The Hamhocks Slaughterhouse was a massive compound composed of a number of animal pens, knackeries and butcheries in the Sow's Foot district of Baldur's Gate .</p>
<p>The establishment had a mixed relationship with the surrounding neighborhood. While their location was convenient to local butchers, the odor drove away the animals of the herders and wranglers.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As expected, Hamhocks was covered in the stench of animal blood.</p>
