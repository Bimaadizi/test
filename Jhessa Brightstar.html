<p>Jhessa Brightstar was a priest of Lathander in the town of Idyllglen .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A descendant of Solndor Brightstar , Jhessa was just as dutiful and humble a servant of Lathander.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jhessa was present in Idyllglen when it was nearly entirely destroyed by Yeenoghu and his band of gnolls and demons . She led her congregation in prayer, imploring Lathander to send the angel Zariel to save the town as she did once before. Thanks to their prayers, Zariel arrived riding atop a golden mammoth and led the Hellriders of Elturel , including Yael , Olannthius and Haruman , against the Lord of Savagery. Together they managed to banish the demon lord back to Avernus before charging after them.</p>
