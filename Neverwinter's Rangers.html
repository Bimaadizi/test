<p>Neverwinter's Rangers were a group of outdoorsmen and rangers enlisted by Lord Neverember to protect travel across the Sword Coast North and watch over the smaller settlements and often overlooked communities of the region and ensure their safety.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The rangers organized themselves into small bands that comprised volunteers, hired mercenaries, and some elves that dedicated themselves to the safekeeping of the land.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>While they provided safety for the places they watched over when faced with lesser threats, their smaller bands could be overwhelmed by more grave dangers. Nevertheless, the group as a whole provided good will for the people outside Neverwinter proper with minimal resources needed to keep the group active.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A band of Neverwinter's Rangers led by Dassar Truebow were tasked with protecting Watcher's Forest from Ashmadai cultists that originated out of Helm's Hold . Dassar personally worked with the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge to route the cultists from the Crypt of Vigilance and slay the Ashmadai devil -summoners that were conducting their dark rituals in the woods.</p>
<p>Some time later, the rangers were tasked with investigating the threat posed to Roth√© Valley and its village by drow slavers. A handful of their members went unaccounted for during the scouting mission and some were even slain. Dassar again enlisted the aid of his adventurer to stop the slaving operation. Dassar's second Imbross Irri'Karr helped the adventurer lead a slave uprising in the drow camp, and directed them to Mayor Gunderson so they could free the town, and take the attack to the drow of House Xorlarrin at their outpost in the Underdark .</p>
