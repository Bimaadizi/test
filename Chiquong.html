<p>Chiquong was a shukenja and holy man in the land of Koryo .</p>
<p>Seeking a suitable locale for his hermitage, Chiquong had journeyed to the southern tip of the island of Saishu , but had still found nothing to his liking. So instead he raised an island from the depths of the sea, a desolate rock that came to be called Su'un . There he dwelled, with the wind his only companion.</p>
<p>Rumors told that Chiquong still lived on Su'un by 1350 DR , and that he could predict the future and hid great riches.</p>
