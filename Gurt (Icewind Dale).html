<p>Gurt was a Reghedmen barbarian lout of Icewind Dale in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He wore leathers and furs.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 1490s DR, Gurt, Fennor , and Rond were in Targos loading supplies onto a dog -pulled sled when Fennor spotted the Uthgardt Elk tribe barbarian Holga Kilgore and, from her tribal markings mistook her for a member of the Reghedmen Tribe of the Elk . Rond knew Holga had been banished from her tribe from marrying a "Southlander", and Gurt called her a "castoff", so Fennor said she should cover her markings to avoid angering the Tribe of the Elk. Soon, the gang were throwing mud and jeers at her, but Holga ignored them and left.</p>
