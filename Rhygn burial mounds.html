<p>The Rhygn burial mounds were a pair of artificial hills in the Kingdom of Mertwig that acted as the resting place of the conquered Rhygn civilization.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The two burials were known individually as Acme and Heaptop . The area around them emanated a palpable aura of pain and suffering. They were encircled by a large ring of standing stones , referred to collectively as the "Monolith". These stones were somewhat magical in nature, as sometimes interacting with them could cause a spellcaster to gain knowledge of new spells .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the bloody war between the Rhygn and the father of the future king Mertwig , these mounds were constructed to house the bodies of the Rhygn's warriors and their king. Decades later, the mounds were considered a holy site. Some would make offerings of gold pieces or weapons in hopes of receiving a blessing from the spirits of the Rhygn. However, these offerings sometimes angered the spirits and they would strike back at the offer-giver with a deadly curse .</p>
<p>When King Mertwig was on the verge of death at age 65, various fortune hunters and individuals claiming to be his long-lost heirs scoured his kingdom in search of wealth, searching even the burial mounds.</p>
