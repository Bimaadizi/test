<p>Raja al-Sadiq was a ruthless sha'ir inhabiting Rog'osto in east Zakhara in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was ambitious and greedy.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Raja was part of a group of bounty hunters who accidentally stumbled across the ruins of Tadabbur in the jungle while searching for lost treasures. Her group removed a unique talisman they discovered from the ruins, unknowingly breaking the seal that had kept Tisan Balshareska , the Arch Geomancer , imprisoned for ages.</p>
<p>Tisan struck a deal with Raja, tasking her to retrieve the Seal of Suhail min Zann in exchange for rulership and power. Raja used Tabati , an invisible stalker and her servant, to track down the seal. Both Tisan and Raja were bound by a geas so they could not betray each other, but unbeknownst to Raja, Tisan planned to use a wish to safely break the geas when the seal was retrieved.</p>
