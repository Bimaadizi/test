<p>Soulrider devils were a variety of parasitic devil that latched onto hosts, controlling their bodies and feeding on their souls.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Soulrider devils cared nothing for the safety or well-being of their hosts.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Soulrider devils were infirm yet quick and nimble creatures that lacked any real abilities of their own beyond the ability to attach to and take control of a host, but the process involved a 10-minute-long ritual and therefore could only occur outside of combat. Once a victim was under control however, they could drain a host's life force to empower strange magical attacks. Such draining hurt the devil, but would kill the host if doing so kill the soulrider. Attempts to daze or stun they would instead see them attack their allies instead.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Soulrider devils typically relied on their host's abilities during combat. If encountered without a host, they fell back on using their feeble claws. If their draining of life force killed a host, they detached themself and fled to seek out a new one.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Soulrider devils attached themselves to humanoid hosts, preferably eladrin or drow , and took control of their body while feeding off of their soul. The host remained fully aware of what was happening during this, but the strength of will it took to resist the parasite was rare. They were considered unusual for being among the few devils to lurk near drow settlements, for drow had a long history of trafficking with demons .</p>
<p>Soulrider devils were considered vile creatures, and only other devils or the allies of devils could stand to be near them.</p>
