<p>Escanor Tanthul was the eldest of the twelve Princes of Shade , the cabal of Netherese arcanists and warriors that embraced shadedom during their self-imposed exile to the Shadowfell . He led his brothers during their initial endeavors after returning to Faerûn in the late 14 th century DR , after having spent nearly a thousand years on another plane of existence .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was the most massive of the twelve princes, made more intimidating by his massive horned helmet, and night-black tabard he wore over his armor. His eyed gleamed the color of bright copper , and turned fiery red when he was angered.</p>
<p>This appearance was not his true form however. Like the other Princes of Shade, all that remained of Escanor's mortal body was a still-beating black heart set within a rib cage of black bone, surrounded by wisps of shadow in humanoid form.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Prince Escanor could be quite charming when he chose, and equally as intimidating when the moment required.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The mighty prince was immortalized in a life-size quartzite sculpture carved by the famous stone giant artist Aris .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Escanor opposed Hadrhune and was closely allied with the second eldest of the Tanthul princes, Rivalen .</p>
<p>During their time together, Escanor became attracted to and then infatuated with Vala Thorsdotter , a Vaasan warrior that saved his life. For a time, Vala insisted that she remain by the prince's side, but changed her mind when he revealed his true intent for her: that she remain his escort within his estate in the flying city of Thultanthar .</p>
<p>The growing bond forming between Escanor and Vala incited intense feelings of jealousy in the Evereskan elf Galaeron Nihmedu . Prince Escanor and Galaeron were forced to still work alongside one another however for a time, as the elf possessed a wealth of knowledge about the phaerimm bestowed upon him by Escanor's late younger brother Melegaunt.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Return of the princes in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Escanor was the first to appear before the youngest brother Melegaunt at the site of the Karsestone . Wasting no time, he traveled alongside Clariburnus and Aglarel to the Marsh of Chelimber to slay the hated phaerimm , which had been released into the Realms several tendays earlier. In the marsh they first met Lady Laeral Silverhand of Waterdeep , the first diplomat of the Realms with which they would ally to defeat their ancestral foes.</p>
<p>In the months that followed, Escanor led the prince's efforts in trapping the phaerimm within the Greycloak Hills , trapping them between Evereska 's mythal and the shadowshell they created some distance beyond it. It was then he began working with the Evereskan elf Galaeron. During their efforts, Escanor was seriously injured by one of the creatures and returned to Thultanthar to recover. After his recovery, Escanor and Vala refocused their efforts towards the phaerimm that surrounded the ruins of ancient Myth Drannor .</p>
<p>On the eve of their departure from Thultanthar, Galaeron had a falling out with Vala and fled Thultanthar, depriving the Shadovar of access to Melegaunt's accumulated knowledge. Escanor tried to gain insight into Galaeron's motives from Vala, but was unsuccessful. Tiring of her reticence, Escanor threw Vala into the dungeons beneath the Irithlium of Myth Drannor , to fight and likely die by the phaerimm. But Vala survived the ordeal and was presented before the Most High Telamont Tanthul back in Thultanthar.</p>
<p>Escanor was killed in bed within his palace in Thultanthar by Vala Thorsdotter.</p>
