<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mountain Fist was a fabled magic item that originated from the dwarves of pre- Weeping War Myth Drannor . According to a legend, the master of the Mountain Fist fell to the chilly life-draining touch of shadows sometime in the past. Returning to existence as a shadow , the master of the Mountain Fist slithered into the deepest parts of the Dwarven Dungeons along with the enchanted weapon.</p>
<p>In 1369 DR , Mountain Fist could be found inside a chest in the Deep Halls of the Dwarven Dungeons guarded by skeleton lords and shadows . Once the chest was opened, the ancient master of the enchanted club appeared out of the inky darkness of the dungeon along with two other shades attacking the people who dared to take its treasure.</p>
<p>The blind cleric of Mystra Beriand was familiar with the weapon's lore and shared the legend with the group of adventurers from Phlan who were making their way through the ruins in order to stop the Cult of the Dragon 's plot to corrupt the city's mythal and pool of radiance .</p>
