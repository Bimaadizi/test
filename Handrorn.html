<p>Handrorn was a human blacksmith that lived in Khôltar , the Iron City, in the mid– to late– 4 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Handrorn was a burly blacksmith, described as a gigantic man.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He was a skilled armorer because he crafted a suit of armor for himself.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the year or two following the invention of a robust new wagon design by Ulbrask Hael in the Year of the Bitter Smile, 368 DR , Khôltar saw tremendous growth in its economy, and space inside the protective wall again became scarce as temporary structures gave way to sturdy stone houses and workshops. The dwarves , led by Shieldlord Amberu Khôltar , were garrisoned in the Iron City and were managing to hold the wall around the town against a plague of attacks from Shaaryan raiders, but would not or could not protect anything built outside the wall or pursue the evasive nomads. Handrorn got tired of this defense-only strategy and demanded that he be allowed to lead a company of Khôltans to destroy or drive off the raiders for good.</p>
<p>Amberu thought it was a bit foolish, but saw that Handrorn and his disgruntled supporters had a chance to succeed, and at the very least it would get some angry humans out of the city where they couldn't rouse the rabble. The Shieldlord gave them some funds for armor, weapons, and mounts, and a charter to wage war against the Shaaryans on behalf of the city. Handrorn and his cadre tackled the challenge with an enthusiasm bordering on the berserk. They slaughtered nomads across the land east and south of the Iron City to such an extent that the raids against Khôltar stopped and the raiders were forced north where they had to settle for attacking softer targets like Shaarmid and sites beyond.</p>
<p>Handrorn became known as the Iron Blade and the city eventually named the northern gate Handrornlar in his honor.</p>
