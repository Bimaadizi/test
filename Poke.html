<p>Poke was a monk and a member of the Disciples of St. Sollars the Twice-Martyred at the Monastery of the Yellow Rose in the midâ€“14th century DR . Poke was the head of the monastery at the time, holding the rank of Grand Master of Flowers.</p>
<p>Grand Master Poke died suddenly in the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR . This necessitated that Kane , a Master of Spring and next-in-line for the position of Grand Master, hurry back to the monastery and manage affairs until a new Grand Master could be trained and selected. However, Kane had no wish to remain in the position, and the next most senior monk, Temmenische , was near a hundred years of age. Thus Kane and Temmenische selected the much younger Cantoule to succeed Poke as Grand Master.</p>
