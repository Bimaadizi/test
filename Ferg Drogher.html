<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the army assembled by the Cult of the Absolute moved from the Moonrise Towers in the Chionthar Valley to menace the city of Baldur's Gate, displacing countless refugees along the way. Many of the refugees arrived at Baldur's Gate searching for safety behind its walls; however, most were refused entry â€“ those lacking coin or proper paperwork. The Rivington district became a refugee tent city, igniting xenophobia among the locals. Ferg Drogher, a peddler of mementos from Rivington, despised the newcomers and was among those who aggressively advocated against the refugees.</p>
<p>Secretly, Ferg Drogher was a member of the Church of Shar that operated in Baldur's Gate's seedy underbelly. He was stationed in Rivington as the cult's lookout.</p>
