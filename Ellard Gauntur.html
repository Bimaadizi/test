<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1479 DR , five Dragons acted as escorts for the War Wizard of Cormyr Ellard Gauntur in his pursuit of the renegade Rorskryn Mreldrake . They caught up to Rorskryn as he used a portal to Marsember , while in the shape of a woman; Ellard Gauntur figured out that it was Rorskryn transformed from a stain on her clothes, and then got pushed by Ilstan Narbrace through the portal for his trouble.</p>
<p>Then the evil vampire archmage Manshoon sent the death knight Targrael after them to hide Mreldrake's trail. Targrael found Hethel at the top of the King's Tower in Marsember; he was at the wizards' armory, asking if Ilstan Narbrace, whom Targrael had just killed, had noticed anything amiss. She slashed his throat as he peeked his head out of the door.</p>
