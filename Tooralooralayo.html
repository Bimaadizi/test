<p>Tooralooralayo was a beggar, or possibly, a refugee, from the city of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tooralooralayo was a human woman with a light skin tone, dark brown eyes, and shortly-cropped blonde hair. Her skin was dirty and clothes were humble.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Spatula Farggo , a worker from the Elfsong Tavern 's kitchens, began helping out the beggars in the Lower City , by bringing them kitchen scraps and leftovers to those in need, both locals, and the refugees fleeing fro the armies of the Absolute . Tooralooralayo and her son, Pickles , were among those who happily accepted the scraps. Tooralooralayo's boy was happy to have more than one meal a day and the woman herself worked about Spatula Farggo getting in trouble for his sneaky generosity.</p>
