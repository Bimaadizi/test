<p>Razor grass was a special type of grass that could be found in small scattered areas throughout Pelleor's Prairie surrounding the Hill of Lost Souls .</p>
<p>As the name implied, razor grass was incredibly sharp, and could easily cut passing animals or unarmored humanoids . The only distinguishable feature of this grass was that its blades appeared slightly silver compared to regular green grass. Razor grass was not carnivorous but was often found near the squid jail plant , which was a carnivorous plant.</p>
