<p>Uligker Oloskar was a merchant who dwelled in the city of Procampur in the Vast .</p>
<p>Oloskar maintained a country house in the nearby town of Maerstar , and fled there following the chaos and disaster in Procampur during the Time of Troubles , 1358 DR , along with number of other merchants. However, they were harassed by looting mobs of refugees from Tantras , Calaunt and even Mulmaster , who'd also come through Maerstar. Oloskar buried a collection of moonstones and pearls in one of Maerstar's horse paddocks to protect them from the looters, but did not survive to retrieve them afterwards. The hoard was reputed to still be buried in Maerstar in the years after.</p>
