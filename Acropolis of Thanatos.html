<p>The Acropolis of Thanatos was the largest temple devoted to the worship of the goddess Kiaransalee .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Acropolis of Thanatos was located under the Galena Mountains , northeast of the Moondeep Sea , in the center of V'elddrinnsshar . It stood in a lake-filled cavern with its ceiling covered with thousands of skulls, atop a spire of white stone that held a set of spiraling stairs guarded by boneclaws .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The temple was a brooding block of black marble veined with red, filled with misshapen corridors, windows, and gaping doorways. Many of the stairs trickled with what seemed to be rancid fat and many of the rooms had their walls covered in murals depicting gruesome scenes painted with dried blood. Most of the temple and the cavern itself shone with the light of the faerzress .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Crones accumulated a massive amount of voidstone within the Acropolis in order to sustain a gate to the Negative Energy plane , hoping to summon an army of undead. Circa 1376 DR , the massive amount of voidstone reacted with the faerzress , augmenting it and causing faerie fire to appear when drow clerics and wizards cast divination and teleportation spells. When an expedition of wizards from Sshamath and priests of Eilistraee arrived at the temple, a fight ensued. The expedition was defeated, and the chief part of the temple where the sphere of voidstone was kept hovering in the air was reduced to rubble.</p>
<p>When Q'arlynd Melarn used Elven high magic to erase Kiaransalee 's name from everyone's mind, all the Crones either died if they were undead or were left extremely confused and lost. By Qilu√© 's orders (under Wendonai 's influence), Cavatina Xarann killed all those that remained, and with a group of priestesses, they destroyed the voidstone and hunted the remaining undead that didn't perish when Kiaransalee did.</p>
