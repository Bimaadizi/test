<p>The Burning House of Kossuth , also known simply as the Burning House , was the preeminent temple of Kossuth in Thay until its destruction in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple was located in the heart of the city of Tyraturos , where it was said the dry plains appealed to the fire god Kossuth.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The temple was open to the sky and surrounded by fires that were always kept burning. The interior included hallways and a kitchen.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Sacrifices to appease Kossuth were performed by feeding animals and slaves to the temple's fires.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of 1357 DR , the temple was the most important house of the Kossuthan faith in Thay if not all of Faerûn . This changed when it burned down sometime in or shortly before 1370 DR , leaving the Flaming Brazier in Bezantur to claim the title of largest and most prestigious Kossuthan temple.</p>
<p>While the destruction of a Kossuthan temple by fire was commonly understood to be not merely a sign of Kossuth's displeasure but an invitation to rebuild bigger and better, the Burning House's high priest— Eternal Flame Klanak Famouth —abandoned the rebuilding efforts to his juniors so that he could seek revenge on the Eternal Flame of the Flaming Brazier, Mythalanir , whom he blamed for his temple's destruction.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The temple was home to Kossuthan priests and their slaves, who did menial labor within the temple and were used as sacrifices.</p>
<p>Notable inhabitants included:</p>
