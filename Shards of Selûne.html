<p>The Shards of Selûne were three magically enchanted gemstones that were blessed by the goddess Selûne .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The gems shone with a bright moonlight.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The gems were powerful objects that possessed holy powers. Although the gems could not harm them, plaguechanged creatures feared the powers of the gems and usually shun them, as the gems caused great pain to any plaguechanged creatures that touched them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1479 DR , when the goddess Selûne gazed upon Neverwinter, she despaired while seeing the tribulations of the city and its inhabitants. She shed three tears, that became gems and fell in the city like shooting stars. Lady Jasmine , the head priestess of Selûne in Neverwinter, recognized the shards as a sign from her goddess and tasked a group of adventurers to retrieve the gems.</p>
<p>The gems were later used to purify the Shard of Night and re-consecrate it to the goddess.</p>
