<p>Awajiga was a community of weavers and one of the many isolated villages of the Fochu Peninsula in Wa .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The people of Awajiga were suspicious of strangers and not at all welcoming. It had a population of about 350 individuals after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR) .</p>
<p>At that time, the leader of Awajiga was constructing a canal from the Nanaichi River to the south, hoping to improve the settlement's capacity to grow crops and improve the financial health of its citizens. The canal was 6 feet (1.8 meters) deep and 15 feet (4.6 meters) wide.</p>
<p>Most of the structures within the village were simple peasant shacks known as minka , built from wood with latticed walls and straw-thatched roofs. Apart from these poor residences were small barns, warehouses, and shops.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Awajiga was located on the west coast of the Fochu Peninsula of Tsukishima , north of Fochu , off a spur trail from the Hisano Road .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Villages in Wa were run by an administrator known as a shoya , typically a minor samurai , and Awajiga was no different in this respect. The shoya could call upon a local militia if needed. The shoya of Awajiga after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR) was Nasu Anteki , an enterprising businessman who always wore a bright red kimono .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Like the other tiny settlements of the region, Awajiga had little contact with the other villages, much less with the rest of Kara-Tur or regions beyond. The people were weavers, but there is no evidence that they actively traded their goods with other settlements.</p>
<p>The cost to spend the night in one of the small minkas was 3 fen . The village did not produce anything more expensive than 4 yuan to sell.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>About 35 citizens of Awajiga served in its militia. These persons were only armed with simple clubs or spears .</p>
<h2>Religion</h2>
<p>Unlike the other settlements in the region, the people of Awajiga were not particularly religious.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed coiled dragon Za-Jikku began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical butterflies, the breath of which would create yun ch'i , the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever.</p>
<p>During the same time period, the village ran into problems with the Order of the Snake , a yuan-ti cult.</p>
