<p>The Temple of Waukeen in Arrabar was a major place of worship of the Merchant's Friend, Waukeen , that rose to prominence after the goddess return to Toril in 1371 DR , after being imprisoned by Graz'zt . The Temple was the base of the Waukeenar private mercenary company – the Order of the Sapphire Crescent .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Arrabarran Temple of Waukeen stood on cobblestone street surrounded by other centers of worship. The Temple of Silvanus was adjacent to the Temple of Waukeen, located to its southwest. Temples of Tempus and Lliira were located in the same district of Arrabar.</p>
<h2>Exterior</h2>
<p>The Temple of Waukeen stood tall on a large open lawn. The building was crowned with a mammoth dome surrounded by spired towers of various heights. The temple walls were gilded with precious metals and gemstones , shining bright and visible from across many blocks away. The temple was in the process of being expanded in 1373 DR to accommodate doubled number of priests that joined the church. The new wing was plastered and painted when the construction was complete and was decorated with even more church treasures. Lush gardens were a part of the Temple, frequented by priests who needed quiet contemplation or a nap.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The temple's interior was just as luxuriously decorated with gold and precious stones as was its exterior. The domed temple had huge arched openings that functioned as windows, and doors were the only parts of the structure not covered in wealth. The walls of the temple's hallways were decorated with expensive tapestries woven with thread-of-gold and tiny sparkling gems. The tapestries resembled stained glass windows of temples' of lesser wealth.</p>
<p>Many spires of the temple housed living quarters and offices of higher-ranking priests, including the Grand Trabbar's office filled with temple's bookkeeping, agreements, and deals, as well as offices of Syndos. Spiral staircases stretched up to the spires' tops. Premier priest chambers were located within spires' rotundas, each centered with cheerfully bubbling fountains.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Church of Waukeen became one of the major powers in Arrabar, forging trade agreements with merchant houses of the city and overseeing trade that flowed through the Dock District. The Order of the Sapphire Crescent was sent to travel with trade ships, protecting the goods and ensuring profitability. The Temple of Waukeen also owned numerous shops and merchant stalls in Arrabar.</p>
<p>Red- robed Halanthi priests of the Temple were the most numerous members of the clergy. They directly followed commands of the Grand Trabbar – one of the highest-ranking priests in Arrabar, after the Overgold of the temple. Among other responsibilities of the Halanthi, assisted by Telchar and Coins, was marching and dispersing boons of the church during the grand festival of the Spheres , held annually on Tarsakh 10 .</p>
<p>The Grand Trabbar circa 1373 DR was Lavant , a corrupt priest who formed a cabal with powerful merchant houses of Arrabar. The Syndo in the 14 th century DR was Kovrim Lazelle , the leader of the Order of the Sapphire Crescent. The High Priest at the time was the Grand Syndar Mikolo Midelli .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , the Temple of Waukeen in Arrabar has been in a period of great growth after Waukeen's return to Brightwater . Seemingly every day, the ranks of Waukeenar swelled with new faces. Grand numbers of the resurgent faith called for temple's expansion was almost complete by Tarsakh of 1373 DR.</p>
