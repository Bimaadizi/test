<p>The ch'ien was the highest unit of currency used in Kara-Tur .</p>
<p>The ch'ien took the form of a small bar or miniature ingot minted from silver . One ch'ien was worth 10 taels , 10 ch'ao , 200 yuan , or 1000 fen . If transported to Faer√ªn circa 1357 DR , 1 ch'ien might be valued at 2 to 8 gold pieces , while its actual value would be 5 gold pieces or 100 silver pieces .</p>
<p>Being clumsy to carry, the ch'ien was rarely used in everyday trade, and instead saved or hoarded for large purchases or in the event of financial collapse.</p>
