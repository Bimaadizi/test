<p>Shameo was a fermented alcoholic drink made and consumed by the Nubari Zantira tribe of the Malatran Plateau in Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The drink was made out of thick roots of shameo water lily that grew in the shallows of the Sleepy Lake where it was foraged by the Zantira children and women. The roots were ground and juiced. The resulting drink was fermented until it became the local specialty intoxicant. Shameo was a colorless and bitter-tasting alcoholic drink, one of the main trading commodities produced by the Zantira.</p>
