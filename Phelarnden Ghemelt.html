<h2>Appearance</h2>

<h2>Personality</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>After being offered the office of the Magister , Phelandern decided to try and manipulate other factions of mages, such as the Red Wizards of Thay , the Arcane Brotherhood , or the Twisted Rune , into stalemates, so they could not focus their force on him. He also had plans to draw them into an attack on Halruaa , which he hoped to observe or even use as cover to steal some of their magic. He also coveted a number of fabled orbs of power , supposedly owned by Alair Nalabukhar , of the Calishite Nalabukharn family.</p>
<p>Before he could get much of his schemes into motion, however, he was overwhelmed by challengers from Calimshan and Thay, destroying first his tower in wave attacks, and then a number of manors he seized. He was finally torn apart over the Shining Sea , near an island home of his', by Veldribold of Calimport , who died too soon after to inherit the mantle of the Magister .</p>
<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>Phelandern actually knew only rumors of the orbs of power he coveted.</p>
