<p>Frost lizards were aggressive magical lizards that were a threat for caravans traveling through Icewind Dale and Spine of the World .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Frost lizards where small 3‑foot-long (0.91‑meter) white creatures that could glide on snow and ice. Their scales' coloring made them almost invisible in snow as long as they remained still.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Frost lizards laid hidden in the snow using their natural camouflage until they spotted their prey. They glided into attack using their breath weapon — spitting out ice balls at a 10‑foot (3‑meter) range. When they approached close enough to the prey, they swiped at it with their sharp claws.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Frost lizards were aggressive hunters. They especially had a taste for the horses and oxen of the caravaneers moving through the lizards' hunting grounds.</p>
