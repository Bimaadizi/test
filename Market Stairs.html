<table border='1'><tr><th>Location</th><td>Old Town , Tilverton</td></tr></table><br>
<p>The Market Stairs was one of three major pedestrian stairs that connected the lower city and the Old Town in the Cormyrean city of Tilverton .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Market Stairs were the stairs in the center of town, while the Tilver Stairs were in the southern part, and the Cormyr Stairs stood on Tilverton's western side. The stair climb was the only way into the less crowded and more prosperous Old Town apart from passing the Upper City Gate on the southernmost side of Tilverton. The stair's name was derived from its being directly connected to Tilverton's market at the heart of the city. Atop the Market Stairs stood a landing where the Rose Altar dedicated to Lathander , the Bringer of the Dawn, could be found. Just like the Tilver Stairs, the Market Stairs stood on the Street of the Sorceress that wildly veered and split through both parts of the city.</p>
