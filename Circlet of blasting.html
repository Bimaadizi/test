<p>A circlet of blasting was a delicate magical circlet that had the power to sear and burn a number of targets.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The wearer of a circlet of blasting could use its power to cast the scorching ray spell , once per day. The circlet regained its power at the following dawn. Pre- Spellplague versions unleashed the searing light spell instead.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A weaker variation of these items, minor circlets of blasting , were recovered from agents of the Zhentarim sometime shortly before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR . These circlets were taken from the Bedine nomads of the Anauroch , suggesting that the items' true origins were the ancient Netherese empire.</p>
