<p>Al'Aif was a warrior Mtair Dhafir tribe during the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was considered to be the most fearsome Mtairi warrior during his time. His face bore a scar brought on by the slash of a dagger as well as four claw marks that were left by a lion .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Al'Aif was a man of honor that believe that people should honor the traditional ways of the Bedine. He was particularly distrustful of all forms of magic.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Al'Aif garnered great trust and respect from Sheikh Sabkhat , leader of the Mtairi people.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The stalwart warrior was distrusting of the Zhent warrior Zarud , when he appealed to Sheikh Sabkhat for an alliance in the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR . When it was revealed that Zarud and his assistant had used magic in their talks, Al'Aif broke the tradition of hospitality and took his jambiya to Zarud's throat. Al'Aif and the sheikh's daughter Ruha managed to talk some sense into Sabkhat, and the agreement was not formalized nor anyone physically harmed. Al'Aif disagreed with the sheikh's decision not to strike back against the invaders.</p>
<p>That night Zarud was killed by the Harper agent Lander , his throat slit in the same manner that Al'Aif previously threatened. All signs of the Zhent's death pointed to Ruha and her brother-in-law Kadumi of the Qahtani . Sheikh Sabkhat arranged for both of them along with Lander to be bound and confined to a single tent until they were to be given over to the Zhentarim as compensation. Al'Aif freed the pair, took the blame for Zarud's death, and gave them supplies to make their escape from the Mtairi camp.</p>
