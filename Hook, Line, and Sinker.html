<p>Hook, Line, and Sinker was a tavern located in the settlement of Caer-Konig in the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale during the late 15 th century DR . It was readily identifiable as the most popular locale in the entire town.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The tavern was located in the town's market square.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The tavern's owner Eglendar "Glen" Korr had a unique marketing scheme that tied into his business' name. The "hook" was the free half-pint of ale personally given to every patron, whereas the "line" referred to the subsequent drinks they invariably ordered afterwards, and the "sinker" was the tavern's last call, which culminated in drinking contests held between town locals and visitors.</p>
<p>The ale the tavern served came from the dwarves of the Dwarven Valley , the settlement at the base of Kelvin's Cairn .</p>
