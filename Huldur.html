<p>Huldur was an innkeeper who ran the Phoenix Tail Inn in the Crossroad Keep in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Huldur was a gruff-looking human man with graying hair, pale skin, a trimmed beard, and a mustache. He appeared absolutely mundane and unremarkable. By some accounts, Huldur looked like any other barkeep in the Realms .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Presumably, Huldur was a married man, as he had a brother-in-law who once owned land near the town of Port Llast . However, Huldur had never been to that part of the coast.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Huldur purchased the Phoenix Tail Inn from Sal of Neverwinter , who ran the establishment during and shortly after the Shadow War of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR . Subsequently, Huldur's purchase began to suffer due to the crumbling post-war economy. Luckily, the Crossroad Keep became the headquarters of the trading company run by Sa'Sani . Huldur welcomed the new residents and was hopeful for his business.</p>
