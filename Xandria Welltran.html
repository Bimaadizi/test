<p>At some point in the 1480s DR , Brother Keefe and the Kelemvorite clerics of Phlan were offered some manner of evidence showing that Xandria was not in fact human but rather a green dragon that had been polymorphed . This information originated from the Lords' Alliance from the far off Sword Coast region of western Faer√ªn . Phlan's thieves' guild, the Welcomers were also informed as well.</p>
