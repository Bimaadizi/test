<p>The thalver , bedoar , thammarch , shilmaer and ruendil were the currency used in Cormanthyr , later Myth Drannor .</p>
<h2>Foundation to 261 DR</h2>
<p>The coinage of Cormanthyr consisted of:</p>
<p>Thalvers, bedoars and thammarchs were considered small coin. In the times of Cormanthyr , coins were minted square in shape, and slightly thicker than others. These coins were stamped with four identical moon elven runes on each face, allowing the blind to recognize the face value by touch. Each coin's center had a diamond-shaped hole, in which sometimes holes and lumps were scored by elves who intended to communicate in a tactile code.</p>
<p>Though yulthaari were used in large purchases, they did not have a face value. They could be sold for their metal value of 3 platinum pieces .</p>
<h2>261-700 DR</h2>
<p>After the raising of the Mythal , Myth Drannor began to stamp round, oblong coins with a design in the center. These coins were patterned after the races allowed in the city, albeit they mostly kept the names.</p>
<p>The representations of members of each race were extremely rare coins, as less than 1,000 of each were minted, for the races in question saw their relative worth to the elves stamped and represented in the coinage. They became worth easily over 100 times their face value and trade weight, even outside Cormanthyr.</p>
