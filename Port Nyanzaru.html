<p>Port Nyanzaru was a port city in northern Chult and the major trading center for all of Chult.</p>
<p>Although independent in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , it subsequently became an Amnian colony until at least 1479 DR before regaining independence sometime in the 1480s DR.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The small port city was located on the Bay of Chult at the mouths of the River Soshenstar and the River Tiryki . It was built atop four hills: Mount Sibasa , Temple Hill , Throne Hill , and Yklwazi Hill .</p>
<p>Accessing Port Nyanzaru by sea through the Bay of Chult required sailing through the domain of Aremag , a great dragon turtle who demanded tribute from any and all passing ships. By land, the city was less than a single day's journey from treacherous swamps and ancient ruins.</p>
<h3>Wards and Districts</h3>
<p>The walled portion of the city was roughly separated into three wards: the upscale Merchants' Ward , the bustling Harbor Ward , and the crowded Market Ward .</p>
<p>Additionally, three slum districts lay outside the city's walls: the Old City to the west, Malar's Throat to the south, and Tiryki Anchorage to the southeast.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>As of the mid–14 th century DR, the Triceratops Society (a.k.a., the Ytepka Society) was the most powerful organization in Port Nyanzaru, and controlled the unloading and loading of all cargo at the docks. They kept tabs on all visitors coming ashore, especially if a visitor was suspected of being a mage or of carrying magic items. If the visitor headed off into the jungle, the Society would send agents to notify the surrounding villages.</p>
<h3>Amnian Trade Colony</h3>
<p>Amn asserted colonial control in Chult during the late 14 th century DR, and by the late 15 th century DR, they and their trading companies controlled all mercantile activities in the city. The Amnian rulers were profiteers, and their taxes were notably high as residents were effectively charged for the safety that the city offered from the jungles. People unaffiliated with a major trading company were forced to live in the shantytowns outside the walls. While the trading companies helped to secure the city against the dangers of the jungle, they were more preoccupied with their perpetual competitions to gain financial superiority over each other, to curry political favor with the Amnian nobility, and to recruit the best and mightiest adventurers to help achieve their goals. There were dozens of trading companies active in Port Nyanzaru, some of which included Charisk Expeditionary Outfitters , Naelishti's Naturals , the Order of Belox , and Zazefay Logging and Mining , as well as the powerful House Selemchant of Amn.</p>
<p>As of 1479 DR, the Amnian governor of the city was a thin human man with a reedy voice and a flair for theatrics.</p>
<h3>Merchant Princes</h3>
<p>Sometime in the 1480s DR, the city gained independence from Amn due to the influence of a consortium of Chultan traders backed by the Triceratops Society. With help from the Society, the seven richest of these traders then rose to the title of merchant princes and ruled the city in a council where each had equal vote. This council could freely create or change the laws of Port Nyanzaru, and would then defer to the city's judiciary to interpret their laws with wisdom and flexibility. The merchant princes took on relatively few day-to-day responsibilities of running the city—preferring to delegate to family members and underlings —and so their government was loosely organized and somewhat inefficient, but it was reinforced by the vigilance of the Triceratops Society, who rooted out real and potential disruptors of the princes' rule.</p>
<p>The merchant princes' power was predicated on their wealth and mercantile influence. The princes leveraged their personal fortunes to manage relationships with foreign realms and to forge profitable alliances, and their tactics were not dissimilar to the Amnians from whom they'd learned statecraft. However, they lacked the military power to claim the treacherous Chultan jungles or to contest nearby rivals such as the Flaming Fist from Baldur's Gate stationed at nearby Fort Beluarian , who claimed control of most of Chult as of the late 15 th century DR. The merchant princes' influence was thus almost entirely confined to Port Nyanzaru and a few lumber and mining operations along the Bay of Chult. Their influence in the Old City was somewhat lessened by the presence of the so-called " beggar princes ", who controlled the area's thieves and used extortion and threats to wield unofficial political power in the district.</p>
<p>The palace of Goldenthrone was the seat of power for the merchant princes. This was where they held audiences and met with their subjects or official visitors, while each prince also managed their private businesses from their personal villas.</p>
<p>In addition to ruling the city, the merchant princes solidified their power by taking total control—either directly or through their intermediaries—over the sale and export of key products, trade goods, and services that passed through Port Nyanzaru. Any sale of a good or service which was claimed by a merchant prince but fell outside of their oversight was considered to be an illegal black market dealing.</p>
<p>If a prince chose to retire, they could pass their wealth and title to a family member or to another wealthy individual of their choice, although their decision was subject to a vote among the other princes in the latter case. By the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, the seven merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru were:</p>
<h3>Law and Order</h3>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, the city was patrolled by guards paid by the merchant princes. In addition, certain laws—notably those that involved a threat to Chult's social fabric or to legal economic activity—were enforced by the Triceratops Society. The city's judges had broad leeway in their interpretation of laws, and fortunately, they had a reputation for being surprisingly resistant to bribes, intimidation, and other forms of corruption.</p>
<p>Most criminals were sentenced to Executioner's Run , a beast-filled pit in the Old City where the brutal deaths of the condemned served as cheap entertainment for the city's populace. However, the Run offered the tantalizing promise of freedom, exoneration, and even fame if the condemned was able to escape the pit alive. Crimes as minor as theft or offending a merchant prince could get someone thrown into Executioner's Run.</p>
<p>It was possible to legally kill someone in Port Nyanzaru by purchasing a "sanction" from the merchant prince Jessamine. These were writs that allowed for a specified individual to be killed via an approved method—usually by stabbing or by poisoning—and cost a minimum of 150 gold pieces (which was subject to be raised based on factors such as the reason for the sanction, the status of the target, and the ability of the purchaser to pay). These were not common—no more than six sanctions tended to be sold in a given year—and many chose not to purchase sanctions for fear of being sanctioned themselves in retaliation.</p>
<p>Smugglers and black market sellers were dealt with particularly harshly under Port Nyanzaru's laws. Slavery was not illegal, although it was unwelcome in the city and slavers were not able to do business with the merchant princes.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Abundant wealth passed through Port Nyanzaru, and a wide variety of both mundane and exotic goods could be found in the city. The majority of foreign trade took place in the Grand Souk while locals made more use of the Red Bazaar , and both were filled with fortune-seekers. As the sale of most goods was governed by the merchant princes' monopolies, foreign traders had to work through the princes' agents to legally do business in the city. Ships arriving into port were subject to inspection, sometimes with the use of the Harbormaster 's magic, and customs agents might confiscate trade goods.</p>
<p>The city's main exports were resources from the jungle and the mountains, including jewels, gold , timber (notably from rubber trees ), exotic plants (and poisons, perfumes , and medicines derived from them), and colorful textile dyes . Jewels from the mountain mines were sold at the Jewel Market , and gem-cutting and jewelry-making were well established trades. The dye works in the Market Ward transformed imported cloth into colorful commodities beloved by both local and foreign buyers. The city's apothecaries also had long traditions of mixing poisons and antidotes. Foreigners in the city were bombarded with offers to sell them all manner of goods, ranging from equipment and tracking services to ancient Serpentes relics and maps of questionable legitimacy.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Residents of Port Nyanzaru spoke the Chultan language . They dressed in light and colorful clothing, often long shirts and knee-length kilts , pants , and sarongs that were dyed with bright blues, greens, oranges, reds, and yellows.</p>
<p>Cleanliness was very important to the people of Port Nyanzaru of all social classes. The people strove to bathe every day, either at the public Bathhouse , the Temple of Sune , or at one of the dozens of private bathhouses across the city. Saunas and baths were likewise the cornerstone of the villas of the city's rich. Thanks to the frequent rains, the city itself was also quite clean.</p>
<h3>Food and Drink</h3>
<p>The recreational alcohol of choice was tej . Popular foods in the city as of the late 15 th century DR included atkilt wat , asa wat , crema Athkatla , doro t'ibs , kinche , and kita . Fish and other seafood were staples, and were sold at a fish market in the Market Ward where the selection tended to be better in the mornings. Chultan fisherman preferred to fish in the ocean rather than the rivers because it was safer to stay out of the jungle. Reptile meat was also eaten, but was seen as tough and undesirable relative to fish.</p>
<h3>Entertainment</h3>
<p>The people of Port Nyanzaru enjoyed loud and wild music , and believed in savoring every precious moment of life. The city had a thriving literary and theater scene with many active book clubs. Formulaic fiction was popular as of the late 15 th century DR, notably mythical romances in which heroes saved their lovers from great dangers or terrible fates.</p>
<p>Popular pastimes included watching and betting on daily fights in the Grand Coliseum or on the survival of the condemned fleeing for their lives within Executioner's Run. Locals and tourists alike also enjoyed attending or participating in the city's famous weekly dinosaur races or the annual Running of the Saurs . During major events that brought in large influxes of foreigners, the city assembled makeshift outdoor parade grounds and markets, where visitors could buy nearly anything.</p>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>Like the rest of Chult, the people of Port Nyaznaru originally worshiped the greater god Ubtao , the protector and patron of Chult. By the 14 th century DR, worship of Savras had also gained traction in Port Nyanzaru, whose priests provided the valuable service of keeping tabs on the inscrutable activities of their yuan-ti enemies.</p>
<p>Following Ubtao's apparent abandonment of Chult at the end of the 14 th century DR, which was believed to be due to him growing tired of the people's warring amongst each other, the Chultan people of Port Nyanzaru came to accept the gods of northern missionaries, most notably Waukeen , the Faerûnian goddess of trade, who was popular among the city's powerful merchant class. This was accompanied by worship of Gond , who was popular among the city's artisans, crafters and engineers; Savras, to whom one of the first great temples to a foreign god was build in the city; Sune , who was appreciated for her emphasis on beauty and cleanliness; and Tymora , who was popular among the vulnerable lower-classes outside the protective city walls who relied on luck (and the defensive walls of the Tymoran temple ) to protect them from jungle monsters.</p>
<p>Animosity would eventually arise against foreign missionaries, who were seen as exploiting the local populace. Thus, by the late 15 th century DR, the city's priests were largely local Chultans even though their gods were foreign.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The city was designed with defense as a priority due to the many pirates in the waters of the Shining Sea . It was protected by a high stone wall that encompassed the inner wards of the city, while the slums remained outside and relatively undefended. Meanwhile, additional walls within the city created added security for important or wealthy areas. The walls themselves were massive edifices of fitted stone adorned with colorful geometric patterns and images of beasts and heroes. The harbor was protected by Fort Nyanzaru , from which was controlled a massive iron chain that spanned the harbor entrance and could be raised to completely prevent ships from entering or escaping the city. In cases of an attack from the sea, warning bells within the fort were sounded and a red beacon was lit atop the harbor's lighthouse .</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, city had no standing army but the merchant princes paid a large force of foreign mercenaries—many of whom were Zhentarim troops—to man the walls, patrol the streets, watch the markets, and guard their personal interests. These guards generally did little to defend the people who lived in the slums outside the walls and the merchant princes made no effort to send mercenaries into the jungle to reduce the threats it posed. As such, the residents of the districts outside the walls organized their own volunteer " Citizens' Brigade " to defend themselves. In cases of an attack, warning horns were used to tell people outside the walls to flee through the gates to safety.</p>
<p>Because of the hot and humid climate, Port Nyanzaru's defenders rarely wore heavy armor , and preferred leather or dinosaur hide shields and armor . However, there was growing interest in metal armor by the late 15 th century DR, particularly in equipment made from lightweight titansteel .</p>
<p>Thanks to the many rain traps located atop the buildings, it was easy to put out fires within the city.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Ancient History</h3>
<p>A lost civilization once occupied the site that would become Port Nyanzaru, and left behind the great ziggurats of the Old City as well as several dungeons , catacombs, and ruins running beneath the Old City, the Harbor Ward, and Tiryki Anchorage. Their ruins were often filled with traps and marked by carvings of wavy or circular patterns, indecipherable glyphs , and of Chultans laboring or hunting each other. Little was known of this civilization save that they were ruled by kings who possessed powerful spells that could inspire whole armies and that they practiced human sacrifice in honor of dark gods. The kings who orchestrated the construction of the ziggurats were also known to have ordered their architects to be buried alive alongside them to serve them in death, perhaps even having them embalmed and placed in sarcophagi in tombs within or beneath the ziggurats.</p>
<p>At some point, a temple to Umberlee was established in caves beneath the Harbor Ward, however this came to be abandoned.</p>
<h3>1300s DR</h3>
<p>By the mid–14 th century DR, Port Nyanzaru had become the most important trade hub in all of Chult, and maintained this distinction even after Mezro ended its isolation in the Year of the Wyvern, 1363 DR . While unconfirmed, it was thought that Port Nyanzaru's harbormaster during this time paid a monthly tribute to a powerful dragon turtle in exchange for keeping all other sea monsters from harming the port and hindering trade.</p>
<p>Under Amnian rule beginning in the late 14 th century DR, Port Nyanzaru existed for the purpose of extracting resources for its foreign overlords, and people not affiliated with their trading companies were discriminated against and left exposed to the dangers and diseases of the jungle. Following the events of the Spellplague in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , Port Nyanzaru was the only major settlement remaining in Chult after the disappearance of Mezro, and this would remain the case through the late 15 th century DR.</p>
<h3>1400s DR</h3>
<p>One night during the 15 th century DR, the Pyramid of the Moon manifested within sight of Port Nyanzaru's walls. By morning, it had vanished along with over 200 people from the city, none of whom were ever seen again.</p>
<p>In 1479 DR, the dozens of Amnian trading companies in the city hosted a great hunt that attracted mighty adventurers from across Faerûn with promises of generous prizes. While the purpose of this hunt was stated to be for culling the dangerous fauna near the city, it was an open secret that it was truly a contest to see which company could sponsor the hunters who slew the most powerful or exotic monster.</p>
<p>Amn withdrew from the city in the late 15 th century DR. This was done under pressure from powerful merchants and after a realization that failure to surrender the city would mean a bloody conflict that would likely end with them losing control regardless.</p>
<p>In the late 1480s DR, vegepygmy outside of Port Nyanzaru was on the rise. The plant creatures threatened the port inhabitants' safety. Port Nyanzaru's government paid well to adventurers to venture out into the jungles and cull vegepygmies and their chieftains, slowing the creatures' rapid territory expansion.</p>
<p>Nine years after the city's independence from Amn, the death curse struck Toril , leading to an influx of adventurers to Port Nyanzaru seeking the curse's source. At this time, a plot by yuan-ti to smuggle an artifact known as the Dreamer's Amulet into the city set of a frenzy of activity as the city's factions theorized that the item might be causing the death curse.</p>
