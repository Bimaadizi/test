<p>Werewolves were a type of lycanthrope who took the form of wolves at the full moon . Werewolves were the most common type of lycanthropes on Toril . They were found in all climates, both in the wild and hidden in civilization. Werewolf packs were organized similar to wolf packs, with a powerful alpha in command of the entire group. The moral and ethical outlook of the pack tended to follow that of the alpha.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Werewolves were vulnerable to silver or magic weapons and could instantly heal most wounds not inflicted by such weapons. Infected werewolves transformed during the full moon involuntarily. Members of their race that were born with the curse could infect others and could control their shifting.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sel√ªne had a group of non-evil werewolves that worship her, though most lycanthropes were drawn towards the worship of Malar .</p>
