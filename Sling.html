<p>Slings were a simple type of projectile weapon</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Slings consisted of a cord with a pouch to hold a projectile. These cords were typically made of either leather or some form of fabric.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>Slings were intended to be held with one or two hands and twirled in a circle. Once a high speed of twirling was released, the wielder would then launch their projectile at an opponent by releasing one of the sling's strap's ends.</p>
<p>Against unarmored opponents a sling could produce severe bruising or even broken bones. However, they were not as powerful as bows , nor could they launch their projectiles as far as crossbows . Though compared to those weapons the sling was far cheaper and easier to make, costing effectively nothing if the proper materials could be found.</p>
<h2>Ammunition</h2>
<p>Slings were typically loaded with either smooth rounded stones or balls of lead , known as sling bullets . These could be magically enchanted , like bullets of smiting that were more dense and heavier than regular sling bullets.</p>
<p>Unlike some other projectile weapons slings were very versatile and could be used to launch a variety of objects, such as rocks or coins .</p>
