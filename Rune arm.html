<p>Rune arms , also known as arm cannons , were ranged weapons used by artificers to fire blasts of magical energy.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A rune arm could be charged up to fire a blast of magical energy of a particular type. Although this didn't require much concentration, standing still and focusing allowed wielders to prepare far more powerful blasts, at the cost of a lengthier recharging period.</p>
<p>In addition, equipped rune arms passively enhanced other wielded weapons with the same kind of magical energy used for firing.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On Eberron , House Cannith was credited with the invention of rune arms. However, when adventuring artificers from this world crossed over to Toril in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , they found that numerous devices already existed there that were very close to rune arms in practical function, despite having wildly disparate origins and purposes.</p>
