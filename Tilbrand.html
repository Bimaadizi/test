<p>Tilbrand , formerly known as Hilbrand , was a walled port city located just south of the country of Aglarond .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The city lay on the coast of the Wizards' Reach on the Sea of Fallen Stars just south of the Yuirwood . It was situated in between Laothkund to the west and Taskaunt to the east.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The city was ruled by an elected council. It also had a ceremonial position of "High Lord", who oversaw festivals and played host to foreign diplomats.</p>
<p>After the city came under the nominal rule of Thay in the mid–14 th century DR , it was technically administered by Hezess Nymar , the Tharchion of faraway Lapendrar . Nymar's agents visited the city only periodically, and it continued to largely govern itself.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hilbrand was initially founded by the empire of Unther following the great wars between Narfell and Raumathar , but over the passage of time Unther lacked the strength to hold it and Hilbrand eventually declared independence. It remained an independent city the mid–14 th century DR until it was forced to surrendered to Thayan invaders during the Salamander War of 1357 DR . It subsequently was known as Tilbrand.</p>
<p>While many died in the fighting and several older parts of the city burned down in the war, the city soon recovered and rebuilt. Some came to see the Salamander War as having been a blessing in disguise.</p>
<p>Although nominally a Thayan vassal, Tilbrand continued to rule itself and simply pay tribute to Thay. However, within a decade it had grown increasingly confident that Thay was not willing to risk a military venture to punish the city for failing to pay, and so it had begun to give only some of the tribute demanded of it. In that time, it had also grown closer with Aglarond and with the infuential Waverunner clan, both of whom helped to defend the city.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Approximately 20,000 people lived within Hilbrand as of 1357 DR, growing to 25,000 a decade later. It hosted a force of Aglarondan rangers who helped to defend the townsfolk.</p>
