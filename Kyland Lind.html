<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Kyland Lind and his fellow Shadow Druids dispersed nature's cruel punishment to civilized people of the southern edges of Amn . At some point, the Bhaalspawn Abdel Adrian was asked to solve the dire animal attacks on Trademeet. Subsequently, the adventurer and his companions uncovered that the onslaught was the doing of the Shadow Druids. Spite having little goodwill for civilized races, Kyland and a small group of drained found themselves following Faldorn and her aggressive ways. That allegiance was said to had Kyland face Abdel Adrian in battle and be slain. However, some claimed that the confrontation took place after Faldorn's defeat, leaving Kyland and the Bhaalspawn part ways peacefully and the Shadow Druid vowing to work tirelessly fixing the nature balance broken by Faldorn.</p>
