<p>The Steps of Istishia was the most impressive structure within the city of Keltar .</p>
<p>This monolithic shrine to the Water Lord was built thousands of years before the 14 th century DR . Water from the Calim River was diverted by sluice gate and pumped to the top of the structure by hidden screw pumps . The water was then magically guided down the monolith in four stair-like patterns to reach a pool of water surrounding the Steps. To ensure that this pool of water was always clear and clean, it was magically returned to the river twice a day to be replaced with fresh water.</p>
