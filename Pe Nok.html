<p>Pe Nok was a town in the Ausa Province of T'u Lung circa Shou Year 2600. It was part of the Montow District and controlled by the Tan clan .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It stood at the eastern tip of the Joi Chang Peninsula , at the northern mouth of the Straits of Va'shung . A trail ran north to Te Pachan Castle , seat of the Tan clan.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was a small town, with a city wall and docks where customs officials checked cargo. In 2608, the town saw little maintenance and constant woodsmoke had turned its white walls grey and given it a greasy feeling. Within the walls was a hill, atop which stood a shrine that dominated the town.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>The shrine atop the hill was dedicated to the Path of Enlightenment . It was once one of the greatest temples of the faith in the Joi Chang Peninsula and it put Pe Nok on the map, before it was burned.</p>
<p>The town was also home to the Seven Roses Monastery .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) , in the month of Tu, a wu jen of Pe Nok named Merlox finished five magical tapestries and gave them as tribute to the Tan clan in thanks for their protection. Hung in the great hall of Te Pachan Castle, they displayed visions of the past to those who viewed them.</p>
<p>The mysterious Dragon Claw Style martial art was known to be big in Pe Nok around Shou Year 2608 (1358 DR) , among other settlements around the Va'shung Straits. In fact, the forty-eight followers of the Dragon Claw ran amok, attacking those who opposed them and harassing the few members of the Black Leopard Society . They even burned the Path shrine, vandalized it, and made it their own lair. In that year, a ship called Victorious Morning docked at Pe Nok so the scholar Ko La Ko and his adventurer companions could consult with his cousin (four times removed) Ko Dun Kin , a local merchant. Standing up to the Dragon Claws, they were inevitably drawn into conflict with them. If the Dragon Claws and Master Hu Don were defeated and driven out, the people of Pe Nok would take back their town and a T'u Lung militia garrison arrived to protect the shrine until it could be rebuilt and reconsecreted.</p>
<p>At one point, Hai Chi , a rogue nobleman and nephew of Emperor Po , led thirty of his liegemen to Pe Nok and assaulted the Seven Roses Monastery, seeking to murder his former wife Shichi No Ken and the monks who'd given her sanctuary. The attackers were defeated and scattered, and Hai Chi killed. Emperor Po's soldiers arrived soon after to investigate, having come to stop Hai Chi.</p>
