<p>Dayul was one of the Blades of the Old Man as of 1374 DR . On the night of Tarsakh 25 , they became aware of an intruder in Sentinelspire . While they were looking out for the intruder, they came across Lewan and Ulaan . On the orders of Weilus , they tried to get them to return to their room; however, this led to a fight. Dayul's wrist was broken by a hammer blow from Lewan; after he was disabled, it was only Ulaan's intervention that kept Dayul from taking revenge on the young man. He was slain by swarming killoren shortly after.</p>
