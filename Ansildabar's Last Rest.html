<p>Ansildabar's Last Rest was a crypt in Hastarl , Athalantar , during the 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The tomb was in a walled-off burial ground across the city from the Wanton Wench , a tavern.</p>

<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>There was a coffin inside the crypt.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Other than being walled off, the burial ground was left completely unguarded.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point, the crypt had held the mortal remains of Ansildabar , a famous explorer.</p>
<p>Ansildabar's Last Rest was already extant by the Year of the Black Flame, 229 DR , when Prince Elminster Aumar took the alias of Eladar the Dark to become a thief of Hastarl. The prince, and his fellow thief Farl , a local criminal, used the tomb to hide away from the local militia after they greatly offended Thelorn Selemban and Jansibal Otharr , two local noble heirs.</p>
<p>At a later date, Elminster used the tomb for the remains of Tassabra , another fellow thief, evicting Ansildabar's remains to do so.</p>
