<p>Toasted bread or simply toast , was one of the simplest handfoods found in the Realms . It consisted of cooked bread , sometimes seed-bread , often smothered in spreads or soaked in sauces.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Toasted bread was often eaten topped with soft butter , jam , or gravy , and could be prepared on the road over campfire flames. Specialized toasting implements were also used in the coastal town of Spandeliyon in Altumbel . These toasting irons were used to affix bread and cheese together to be fire-roasted.</p>
<p>It was also known to be served as a side for various dishes, like bowls of simple broth , or plated among morningfeast foods like eggs , ham , bacon , apples , and melons , or topped with sliced fried sausage , or stirge , like they did in Waterdeep and Suzail . The dish called tharval-and-dleem was a spread made with tharval , a type of tiny fish, mashed and smothered over toasted bread. Guests of The Jester's Pride in Julkoun could try another fish variation of toast – topped with river trout with a sauce of lemon , cream , and pepper . Tabra's festhall and The Riverman inn in Blackfeather Bridge served buttered toast topped with mushrooms and oysters to its guest and the simple dish was recommended by Volothamp Geddarm as a highlight of the menu.</p>
<p>Toast was also known to be a simple dessert treat when it was served crusted with sugar , notably seen in the Feywild , or covered in butter and cinnamon , as was popular among the guests of The Copper Cup in Waterdeep.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During his visits to Earth , Elminster and the the Wizards Three imbibed squares of toast, something that was presumed to be a type of bread from that world.</p>
