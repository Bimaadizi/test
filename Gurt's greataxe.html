In the Year of the Icy Axe, 123 DR , Gurt fell in battle to the leader of the barbarians, Uthgar Gardolfsson , in a famous battle that marked the ascendancy of humans within the greater Dessarin Valley . Following the battle, Gurt's greataxe was buried within Morgur's Mound , where it remained for over 700 years.</p>
<p>During the Second Trollwar , Gurt's greataxe was recovered and taken back to the city of Waterdeep by Amphail the Just . After being stored in the city's vaults for some time, by 1372 DR , the axe was taken by Open Lord Piergeiron the Paladinson and given to Harshnag the Grim , in recognition of his service in the Gray Hands . The axe was still in Harshnag's possession as of the late 15 th century DR.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>The axe was immediately recognizable by all Uthgardt barbarians , who promptly attacked its wielder on sight.</p>
