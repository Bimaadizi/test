<p>A moonblade was a hereditary magical longsword passed down in elf lineages.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Moonblades were named in part because of the moonstones found in the pommel of each sword but also for the moon elves that wielded them, with the sole exception of the half-elf assassin , Arilyn Moonblade . According to Ethlando , the mage responsible for conception and creation of the largest collection of moonblades, the other elves, such as sylvan elves and sun elves were not prohibited from claiming a blade, it was just highly unlikely.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Each wielder contributed a power to the sword, which would be absorbed through the moonstone in the blade's pommel. However, the wielder could not be separated from the sword for any length of time and expect to live. Each moonblade was unique, as were the powers given to them. In addition to their unique abilities, some moonblades were capable of summoning an elfshadow .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Each moonblade was tied to the elven bloodline that first claimed the blade and was passed from descendant to descendant until there were no more worthy heirs. Every elf in the family had a choice to attempt to bond with the blade. If the elf chose to bond with the blade, they were subjected to the moonblade's bladerite in which the sword judged the character of the prospective wielder. The wielder was not only judged by his own character but also by the characters of all its previous wielders. With each new wielder the blade became harder to obtain by the next user. Any elf judged unworthy by the blade was subjected to the consequences of the bladerite, which usually resulted in immediate death by arcane fire. A claimed blade never bonded with an elf that did not carry the bloodline of the original family, making the blade's magics useless in the hands of anyone else.</p>
<p>The wielders of the moonblades also paid a cost — when they died, their life essence entered the moonblade, to become the source of its magic. Until the moonblade's purpose was fulfilled, the passage to Arvandor was delayed for all of the elven souls within.</p>
<p>The process of crafting a moonblade could not be adequately described — no more than a melody could be conveyed with mere words.</p>
