<p>Nami No Hana , or the Crest of the Wave , was a famous inn in Kozakura early in that nation's history.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Kozakuran Year 1 (−73 DR) , the newly ascended Emperor Akimatsu Mori decided to stay at the Nami No Hana on the night following the battle of Kyoki . However, the master chef there was brother to a slain soldier of the army defeated at Kyoki and wanted revenge. The chef prepared the first emperor's celebratory dinner—the house specialty, raw tiger fugu and daikon ( radish ) sculpted to resemble a flying crane—with the poisonous fugu liver mixed in with the radish sauce on the crane's crest. Fortunately, an apprentice chef, Sumitomo Tomy , spotted something off with the food as it was served, rushed past the guards, and stopped Mori before he could take the deadly bite. The would-be poisoner was invited to dine with the emperor, and forced to eat his own cooking.</p>
