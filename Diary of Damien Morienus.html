<h2>Contents</h2>

<p>The diary itself contained copious notes and theories on the nature of life and death, the necromancer's research into the power of lichdom, formulas, spells, and recipes.

<h2>History</h2>

<p>The Diary was still in Damien's possession circa 1269 DR when the Accursed Tower of the necromancer was swallowed by the mud of the Great Thaw . The inhabitants of the tower perished and were raised as undead because of the curse of one of Myrkul 's clerics. Damien himself was transformed into a crypt thing who was clutching the diary when a group of adventurers discovered the tower in search of the diary.</p>
