<p>Harnoth was, together with his twin brother Bromm , one of the Twin Kings of Citadel Adbar in the Silver Marches in the late 15 th century. He was a son of the famous Harbromm .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the orc and drow invasion in the War of the Silver Marches in the Year of the Awakened Sleepers, 1484 DR , Harnoth and his brother were tricked by the half-drow Doum'wielle Armgo , who posed as an envoy of the Moonwood . Bromm and a dwarf army were led into an ambush where all the dwarves were killed and the white dragon Arauthator , ridden by Tiago Baenre , slew Bromm with its cold breath .</p>
<p>Harnoth also died during the war, but the city's elders, in fear of turmoil, hired a doppelganger to impersonate the king without anybody noticing.</p>
