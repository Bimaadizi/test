<p>An antidote , or more literally, a potion of cure poison , was a potion that could cure a specific poison , or multiple poisons.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Antidotes were a direct cure for a poison. However, they weren't the only way to rid poison, as the poisoned creature could be cured by clerical or druidic magic . They could also cure against magical poisons . Some poisons were antidotes to other poisons. Sometimes even a poison was the antidote to itself, such as specific doses of srindym .</p>
<p>There were many ways to make antidotes, as they cured individual types of poisons, and thus required a range of ingredients in their production. A common ingredient for antidotes was the horn of a unicorn . Another recipe for a thick and chewable antidote was made using a variety of herbs and roots, including salts of mugwart and a certain type of alchemical suspension.</p>
<p>In the land of the Malatran Plateau , antidotes were brewed using curative herbs found in the Living Jungle and kept in yellow-skinned gourds .</p>
