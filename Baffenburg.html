<p>Baffenburg was a large town in what was later the Fell Pass circa −335 DR . Baffenburg's residents were both orcs and dwarves and they had lived together in peace for many years, even merging their languages.</p>
<p>Baffenburg was apparently originally a surface outpost of Delzoun , much like Citadel Felbarr , Citadel Sundabar , and Citadel Adbar . Then the orcs living in the surrounding region came to live there, held in check by a single orc wizard-chieftain named Bowug Kr'kri , who was then murdered by his followers, causing a period of unrest. Over the years, the periods of unrest waxed and waned but got better and the two communities lived together for at least two centuries before an unknown catastrophe melted the permafrost beneath it and made it sink into the ground. This catastrophe likely involved a thinning of the planar borders as overgrown ethereal marauders and creatures from the Plane of Shadow inhabited the ruins by 1372 DR .</p>
