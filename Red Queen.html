<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Red Queen's appearance was hidden by a full-body set of plate mail with impressive pauldrons and a closed helmet , all made of crimson metal. She wielded a long sword made out of the same material.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Red Queen was not a natural-born creature. She was a construct created by Luvia Bloodmire of Baldur's Gate, a mad mage who conducted sinister experiments, crafting undead and construct creatures by melding her victims' bodies and various exotic black market parts. Some of Luvia's work was for hire and the Red Queen was one such creation, made in Arogazia Firewind's image. She was to serve Arogazia, who resided in the Firewind Manor within the Cloak Wood .</p>
<p>Arogazia Firewind, secretly a shape-changed red dragon Aizagora , was an ally of the Zhentarim , who tried to obtain the power of the Onyx Tower and bring ruination to Baldur's Gate. She tasked her loyal Red Queen to assemble and lead a force of goblinoids under the banner of the Red Fang Marauders, attacking merchants, traders, travelers, and caravans in the vicinity of Baldur's Gate. Out of her cave lair in the Cloak Wood, the Red Queen led the Marauders until a group of adventurers came across the Wayfork Village being attacked by the Red Fang. The adventurers tracked the raiders to the Queen's lair and defeated her in battle. Still alive, the Red Queen fled through a secret passage to her mistress's forest manse. But the adventurers followed and found out the Red Queen's true master, Arogazia. Subsequently, the Red Queen met her demise, and Firewind Manor was consumed by a blaze, the Red Fang Marauders were no more.</p>
