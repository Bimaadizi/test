<p>Ivrynxra's Exploration of Enchantments was a biographical magic textbook written by the Netherese arcanist and adventurer Ivrynxra Hoond .</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>Written in an informal, chatty first-person style, the book consisted of many entertaining accounts of Ivrynxra's adventures as she encountered unusual magical effects and spell interactions. Besides the entertaining and informative style, the book had particular value in the rarely-studied yet utterly vital field of what precisely happened when opposing spells intersected, clashed, or overlapped.</p>
<p>The tales included the time Ivrynxra cast a spell on an invisible beholder while falling through the middle of a waterfall, or the time she accidentally struck a ghost with a conjuration spell aimed at another target, and met success regardless.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ivrynxra's Exploration of Enchantments was considered a classic and foundational piece of literature by the arcanists of Netheril during the Age of Discovery ( 2654 NY (−1205 DR) onwards). Any respectable arcane library would be expected to contain a copy, along with other works such as Sarturl's Study of Magical Fields , Oloam's on Serpentine Matters , Skouloond's Spell Studies , and Haerro's Veltanabula .</p>
