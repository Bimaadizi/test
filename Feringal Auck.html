<p>Feringal Auck was the lord of Auckney in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Feringal was not considered a very effective leader, although considering Auckney's status that was not such a terrible thing. Due to his status in court, he was quite lonely; after setting his eyes on Meralda Ganderlay , he spent much effort courting her and trying to be as romantic as possible.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was described as having handsome features.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Feringal became lord of Auckney after the death of his parents. His mother had died giving birth to him and his father had died when he was 5, so his older sister Priscilla and steward Temigast managed the fiefdom in his stead until his coming of age. He became the lord of Auckney when he was 14 years old.</p>
<p>He fell in love with Meralda and arranged to marry her around 1365 DR , when he was aged 24.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>His father was Tristan Auck , lord of Auckney. Feringal's older sister, Priscilla Auck , advised Feringal (whom she called "Feri") on matters of society. She heavily influenced Feringal in his rule of Auckney, since she considered the fiefdom to be properly hers. She was originally against Feringal's marriage to Meralda, in part because Meralda was a commoner and in part because of Priscilla's naturally controlling nature.</p>
<p>Feringal relied on the advice of his steward, Temigast , who helped to raise him after his father's death.</p>
