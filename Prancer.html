<p>The Prancer was a leader among the centaurs of the western Rawlinswood in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was known to be unpredictable, and was intolerant and potentially dangerous towards anyone he viewed as an intruder in his people's forest.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Prancer had a strong distaste for human settlements near his domain, including the Damaran town of Tellerth , which was known to encroach on the woods. However, he tolerated the presence of human druids in the woods. One of the larger druidic communities in the Bloodstone Lands , the Circle of Leth , was active within his territory.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , the Twilight Riders headed to Tellerth to parlay with the Prancer's centaurs in hopes of improving the relationship between the centaurs and the humans of eastern Damara.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , the Circle of Leth was driven out of the Prancer's territory by the Rotting Man .</p>
