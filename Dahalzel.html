<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was described as being rather "brawny".</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dahalzel fought in the vanguard during the Battle of the Fissures in the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR . During the battle, Dahalzel had a spell cast upon his jambiya by the witch Ruha that made it appear as if there were eight times as many Bedine as were actually present. This granted them a great edge as they charged the Zhentarim and their asabis .</p>
