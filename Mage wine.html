<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The effects of mage wine would only trigger when the drink was imbibed by a bard or wizard .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in the late 14 th century DR , in the month of Uktar or " The Rotting ", a cult dedicated to the dead power Moander and backed by the deity Ghaunadaur chose The Hallow-Halls in Ravens Bluff to be the second site in their series of attacks with an experimental gas weapon that had been made near Dark Hollow . They narrowed it down to the shrine of the Seldarine , as they were rivals of Ghaunadaur. A Moanderite in green robes tried to enter the shrine, but was stopped at the door by temple guards. He chose to drop the vial there, unleashing the gas weapon and killing dozens of innocent Ravenians, as well as a nearby unit of City Watchmen that had rushed over to aid the temple guards. All exposed to the green gas were disintegrated, leaving behind no bodies. A group of adventurers working for the Scout Rangers arrived on the scene shortly after, having been alerted to the attack by the sounds of screaming and a panicking crowd.</p>
<p>After the adventurers brought those responsible to justice, the priests at the Seldarine shrine sent them two potions of extra-healing and two bottles of mage wine as a show of thanks for the aid they provided.</p>
