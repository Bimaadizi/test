<p>Lakkar was a frost giant who once lived in the Sword Mountains .</p>
<p>A loyal follower of the god Thrym , Lakkar was gifted an artifact known as the Winterforge by his god, which channeled the power of the icy realms within the Elemental Chaos . With this power, Lakkar waged a unstoppable war of conquest throughout the Sword Mountains . Eventually the Icehammer dwarves of Icespire Peak stood up to him. In response Lakkar absorbed the Winterforge into himself, growing to an immense size and declaring himself a god. This brazen act of hubris angered Thrym, who stripped Lakkar of his defenses and allowed the dwarves to defeat him. In death, his titanic body was frozen solid atop Icespire Peak.</p>
