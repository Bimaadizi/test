<p>Brother Delf was a priest of the god Deneir the Scribe, who lived at a monastery near Verdusk .</p>
<p>Brother Delf once wrote a document recounting the origins of various magical creatures. In it, he gave one of the few known accounts of the creation of the perytons , though he may simply have been retelling an ancient legend. He told how the Khala of Imaskar had been cursed by five gods of law for their wickedness and worship of Bane , and transformed into the peryton. This tale was unsupported by fact, but it did explain all their unusual human traits.</p>
<p>The ranger Talyssa Strongbow visited the monastery and discovered Delf's writings, and repeated it in a book she wrote about the land of Thar .</p>
