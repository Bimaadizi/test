<p>Crypt of Dragons was the name given to an underground cavern-tomb discovered in the mid–14 th century DR in Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The true location of the Crypt of Dragons was not widely known. Locals said the cave could be found a day's travel from Hilp into Azounwood , or into the hills somewhere east from the town.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1357 DR , a simple weaver discovered what he called the Crypt of Dragons not far from the town of Hilp. His name was Orncibl Rhommd , and he claimed that the vast cavern was filled with piles of gold and gems . Corpses of various mummified dragons were carefully arranged atop the treasure piles. They were surrounded by fields of magical protection—crackling blue magic that immediately killed anyone who was stupid enough to approach the hoards (two of Orncibl's apprentices suffered that grim fate).</p>
<p>The weaver himself disappeared soon after he revealed the cave's existence at a tavern in Hilp. He was believed to had been taken by the dreaded Cult of the Dragon or to be hiding from the sinister organization.</p>
