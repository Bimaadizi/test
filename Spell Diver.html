It belonged to Naradon , a mercenary from Thesk who earned his fame for being able to quickly and efficiently dispatch magic-users even when faced with overwhelming odds. Naradon retired due to old age due to excessive use of potions of speed , at the age of thirty-two. He died of old age four years later, and his only heir had no use for Spell Diver . The magic sword was sold to an infamous cat burglar . By the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , Spell Diver was stored in the snaking chambers of marilith Yxunomei , inside the Dragon's Eye caverns on the Spine of the World .</p>
