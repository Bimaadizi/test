<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early Life</h3>
<p>Marek was raised in a wealthy household in the city of Nethjet in Thay . His mother raised him at home with her servants. His father, who worked away from home, was a wealthy merchant. He was recruited into the Red Wizards at the age of 11 on Mirtul 1 , the Year of the Striking Hawk, 1326 DR . He learned to be a mage and excelled in enchantment magic.</p>
<p>While still in Thay, he was sent on a mission with other Red Wizards to confront a tribe of lizardmen in the Surmarsh swamp who had failed to pay their taxes to Thay. Marek and his comrades battled the lizardmen in a swamp and were eventually confronted by the leader of the tribe, a black dragon named Insithryllax. Insithryllax killed Marek's companions before he used a charm monster spell to successfully charm the dragon.</p>
<p>He returned to civilization again around 1336 DR with Insithryllax enthralled by him.</p>
<p>He kept Insithryllax with him for many years. Eventually, the charm spell wore off, but the two became friends without the use of magic and Insithryllax accompanied Marek for decades.</p>
<h3>Innarlith</h3>
<p>Marek was sent by the Red Wizards to Innarlith, a city on the Lake of Steam , to serve as their agent in the Year of the Lion, 1340 DR . Insithryllax, who was still enthralled at the time, came to Innarlith with him. His niece Halina joined him at a later date.</p>
<p>In Innarlith, he posed as a self-employed mage who sold magical items to clients and performed other magical services, while hiding his allegiance to the Red Wizards. He developed connections with the city's elite, through which he gained information and secrets. Marek also helped foment social unrest among the poor of the fourth quarter of Innarlith. On occasion, he also secretly murdered rival mages and caused destruction for people who refused to become his clients. He made sure that all magic trade in Innarlith was controlled by him or it was put to an end.</p>
<p>He developed a project to breed mutant offspring of Insithryllax and female fire drakes , which he called black firedrakes , in order to gift them to others to win influence with them. He started a nursery to breed and raise them underneath the city of Innarlith, but he ran into troubles when he had difficulties getting enough food to feed them. Some of the black firedrakes found a way to escape from the nursery to the surface, where they caused destruction through the city before being either killed by the city guard or secretly teleported back to the nursery by Marek. Afterward, Marek hatched a plan whereby he carved out a small piece of Fury's Heart to form a new pocket dimension he called the Land of One Hundred and Thirteen , because of the number of days it took to pacify it. He made this pocket dimension into a new nursery for the black firedrakes.</p>
<p>On Marpenoth 1 , the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR , an alchemist named Surero exploded a smokepowder bomb in the middle of the street in Innarlith's second quarter in an attempt to assassinate Marek. Surero had had trouble in his alchemy business as a result of competition from Marek's magical items trade. Insithryllax, who was walking in a polymorphed human form next to Marek, embraced him right as the explosion went off and saved Marek's life. Insithryllax then began turning into his dragon form but Marek stopped him, fearing what would happen if he revealed himself in public. The city guard then arrived and arrested Surero on the spot. Marek asked that Surero not be executed and he even arranged for Surero to be released on Alturiak 3 of the following year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he created an army of black firedrakes in his pocket dimension. In the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR , he brought Senator Salatis to the pocket dimension and showed him his army. Marek wanted to overthrow Ransar Osorkon after the latter had begun a project to build a canal from the Lake of Steam to the Nagaflow and thus connect the Sea of Fallen Stars to the oceans of Toril . This project would have undermined the lucrative trade in magic portals supplied by the Red Wizards. Marek sent assassins twice to kill Ivar Devorast , the chief engineer of the project, but both attempts failed. Marek offered his army to Salatis and in return Salatis would obey Marek's instructions once he became Ransar. Salatis agreed to the proposal.</p>
<p>On Highharvestide in 1365 DR, Salatis launched a coup with the aid of Marek's black firedrakes that ended with the assassination of Ransar Osorkon and the confirmation of Salatis as the new ransar by the Senate of Innarlith . Salatis did not end the canal project, to Marek's disliking, but he did agree to the establisment of a Thayan enclave in Innarlith . Marek eventually changed his position on the canal once he realized that the Innarlan public had already embraced the idea and it was no longer possible to stop it. He supported the canal, but the construction would use magic items and services supplied by the Thayan enclave . This included services to animate corpses of dead workers into undead zombies to work on the canal.</p>
<p>Marek murdered Senator Willem Korvan in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , and raised him as an enthralled undead slave. Marek then used this creature as his own personal assassin. In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , he sent the undead Willem to assassinate Senator Inthelph , the master builder of the city-state.</p>
<p>Marek later betrayed Salatis and switched sides to join Senator Pristoleph , when the latter invaded Innarlith with an army and took over the city in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR . But Marek later summoned a maurezhi from the Abyss and ordered it to kill Pristoleph after the latter had ordered for Ivar Devorast to take over the canal project again. The black firedrake bodyguards that Marek had supplied the ransar, however, succeeded in stopping the assassination from being carried out. Pristoleph came to suspect that Marek was behind the attack and sought to arrest him, but Marek remained within the Thayan enclave and thus on foreign soil.</p>
<p>Insithryllax was affected along with other dragons by the Rage of Dragons that occurred in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , and Marek transported him to the Land of One Hundred and Thirteen, where he remained for months before Marek sent him back to the Prime Material plane . Insithryllax then left Marek permanently and headed back to the Surmarsh in Thay .</p>
<p>Marek sent the undead Willem Korvan to assassinate Ivar Devorast, however, Willem failed in the attempt and Devorast survived. During a period of several months when Devorast and Pristoleph were absent from the city, Marek took the opportunity to place a magic portal to be placed on the canal in order to ensure that the project still relied on Thayan magic. When Pristolpeh and Devorast returned, Devorast used a number of smokepowder charges that he had secretly placed to destroy the canal.</p>
<p>Pristoleph arrested Devorast, but didn't execute him. Marek, who didn't want the canal project to be returned back to Devorast's plan, then used his influence over the Innarlan senate to start a civil war against Pristoleph. He succeeded in turning many senators against Pristoleph and also turned Pristoleph's henchman Wenefir against him. Marek tried to install Senator Meykhati as the new Ransar of Innarlith, acting as a puppet under Marek's influence. Meykhati's faction lost the war, however, and Marek was taken into custody by Pristoleph, who then turned him over to Thayan authorities for judgment.</p>
<p>Marek was then sent to another Thayan enclave in Tethyr and punished with having his hands replaced with hooks that gave him electric shocks.</p>
