<p>Ramships were small, simple galleys used by the pirates of Immurk's Hold to defend their harbor against unwanted intruders.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ramships were very small at only 20 feet (6.1 meters) long (more like a launch or rowboat in scale than a proper galley), and were crewed by ten rowers (prisoners or slaves ) and piloted by a loyal pirate. They were cheaply built and very fragile, and not necessarily expected to survive their ramming attacks. They could also be loaded up with flammables and set alight for extra effect against dire foes, though this ensured that the ramship would definitely be lost (the crew were expected to swim back).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 14 th century DR , ten ramships were kept in a sea cave near the entrance of the Immurk's Hold harbor. Two were active at any moment, and monitored visiting ships that approached the entrance. In the event that ships attempted to attack the harbor—and managed to overcome the malenti , harbor chain , and artificial reefs—all ten ramships were put into action. The ramships served to weaken and slow the invaders while the overlooking Citadel used its Thayvian bombards and the ships in the harbor prepared to respond.</p>
