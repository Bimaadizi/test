<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>After imbibing this potion, the imbiber fell into a peaceful sleep for a few hours. Sleep from this potion had the safe positive effects of a full night's rest; thus, this potion was often used by spellcasters to rapidly increase the rate at which they could re-memorize spells . Being woken during this sleep nullified any of these positive effects.</p>
