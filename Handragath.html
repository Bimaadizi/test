<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR, the Cult of the Dragon was led by Kya Mordrayn to occupy the ruins of Myth Drannor, corrupt its mythal , and tap into the powers of a pool of radiance found under Castle Cormanthor . The Cult needed a constant supply of workers, which they got through slavery. One such operation was helmed by Handragath, who disguised himself as an elderly distant relative of Darnarest , the wizard whose tower was being used as the Cult's outpost, to send adventurers and townsfolk into the hands of the cult.</p>
<p>He sent a group of heroes into the ruins on a false quest to recover ancient writings of the tower's long-dead owner, while the Cult prepared an ambush to capture the able-bodied slaves-to-be. With the capture failing, the heroes made their way to Darnarest's tower, realizing that the Cult of the Dragon was behind recent villager disappearances. The heroes confronted the cultists but found no captured civilians, but only empty shackles. Handragath managed to escape through the portal to Myth Drannor before the heroes were able to slay him. But they saw the false benefactor grab a handful of magical salt and throw it into a brazier in the tower's basement, followed by Handragath jumping through the portal. The heroes followed, but Handragath was long gone.</p>
