<p>Mordenkainen ( pronounced : /ˈ m ɔːr d ɛ n k eɪ n ɛ n / MOR-den-kay-nen listen or : / m ɔːr d ɛ n ˈ k eɪ n ɛ n / mor-den-KAY-nen or : / m ɔːr d ɛ n ˈ k aɪ n ɛ n / mor-den-KIGH-nen ) was a prolific archmage from the world of Oerth who was responsible for many powerful and useful spells .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mordenkainen had a hawk-like face, with a permanent frown that gave the appearance of alertness and almost anger, and a penetrating gaze. He kept a close-trimmed beard and wore grey, high-collared robes. His voice was deep and melodic.</p>
<p>While imprisoned in Barovia , his hair and beard were both long, black and peppered with grey streaks. When mad, his eyes crackled with eldritch power.</p>
<p>He later changed his hairstyle, favoring a bald head and a trimmed goatee, but lost none of his penetrating stare.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Typically stubborn and one who did not suffer fools gladly, Mordenkainen could be difficult even with his friends.</p>
<p>While suffering from his madness, he was convinced that enemies were everywhere and he was being constantly watched by evil agents.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>In addition to many scrolls and potions , Mordenkainen was known to possess a bag of holding , a set of bracers of defense , a crystal ball , a +1 dagger , an efreeti bottle , a wand of cold , a wand of fear , and three pearls of power .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Mordenkainen was the leader of the Oerthian group of wizards known as the Circle of Eight, which included many spell inventors whose names were well known on Toril , such as Bigby , Drawmij , Nystul , Otiluke , Otto , Rary , and Tenser .</p>
<p>Mordenkainen was a good friend of Elminster Aumar ; the two met on numerous occasions at Ed Greenwood 's house on Earth to exchange news from each other's worlds, as well as spells and lore, along with his apprentice, Rautheene . On occasion, the two were also joined by Dalamar of Krynn .</p>
<p>He was also an acquaintance of Khelben Arunsun .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Although Mordenkainen resided primarily on Oerth , by at least the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , his spells were not uncommon among spellbooks in Faerûn . He often traveled to Waterdeep with his friends for revelry in a city where he would not be recognized.</p>
<p>Following the demise of the Circle of Eight at the hands of Vecna during the lich's first failed attempt at obtaining greater deity status, a grieving Mordenkainen was consoled by Elminster, as the wizards reflected on the fragility of their good deeds.</p>
<p>At one point, Mordenkainen created the helmet of disjunction ; it's unknown if he ever made more than one. It replicated the effect of his spell known as Mordenkainen's disjunction , [ speculation ] making it capable of breaking any 'enchantment' within its vicinity. However, he later wanted nothing to do with that "accursed thing" for fear of it destroying all his magical possessions, and he angrily rejected Xenk Yendar when he came to him in Waterdeep circa 1400 DR seeking help dealing with it.</p>
<p>Mordenkainen later traveled to Barovia in an attempt to free the local population from its vampire darklord Strahd . However, he underestimated Strahd's power and, after barely surviving a confrontation with him, he lost his spellbook and his staff, eventually losing his memory and being driven to the brink of madness. He became known by the locals as the Mad Mage of Mount Baratok.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR , Mordenkainen, still suffering from bouts of madness, was in Waterdeep, where Storm Silverhand and Elminster were helping him to recover from them.</p>
<p>By the Year of Twelve Warnings, 1494 DR , Mordenkainen inhabited the Tower of Urm , a dwelling that he used as a vehicle to travel through the multiverse . He occasionally visited Avernus to study the effects of the Nine Hells over the schools of magic and to ensure the balance of the universe.</p>
