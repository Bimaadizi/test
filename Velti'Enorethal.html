<p>The Velti'Enorethal was a school of elven culture in the city of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Velti'Enorethal provided education in elven traditions, history, philosophy, religion, and magic . This came with years of study and practice, and so inevitably taught patience as well. In particular, it was dedicated to the path of Labelas Enoreth and was a center of his faith, but it was not a true temple.</p>
<p>It catered to the children of the elven houses of Loudwater and to friends of the elven nobles. The staff included sages, priests, and wizards .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As recorded in their own histories, two elven houses established the Velti'Enorethal and settled on the site, giving rise to the city of Loudwater.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , a student of the Velti'Enorethal, Galaer Grasswave, became the Green Regent. This attracted many elves to the Velti'Enorethal during his tenure.</p>
<p>The Velti'Enorethal was still in operation by 1372 DR . At the time, the sages, priests, and mages were still trying to ascertain which parts of Glaer's nearly completed ritual to repair the city's magical wards had actually been completed after the Night of the Blood Moon in 1369 DR .</p>
