<p>Sluuguth was a roaming illithid who in 1372 DR tried to take advantage of the Siege of Menzoberranzan by duergars and tanarukk .</p>
<p>He discovered in Lake Donigarten the Archmage of Menzoberranzan , Gromph Baenre , imprisoned in a magical sphere after his defeat in a battle with Lichdrow Lord Dyrr . Sluuguth was convinced by Gromph to free him from the sphere using his psionic powers in exchange for great recompense. Gromph and Sluuguth traveled to the Archmage's quarters in Sorcere , and Sluuguth tried to trick Gromph using " thought bottles " of his own design. Gromph defeated Sluuguth, sealing his soul into a magical axe.</p>
