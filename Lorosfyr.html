<p>Lorosfyr was a bitterly cold and unexplored chasm located in the lowerdark of the Underdark .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lorosfyr was eerily quiet and still. Its depths remained unexplored because individuals who spend too much time within the chasm began to hear faint whispers of madness.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Lorosfyr was a massive chasm located beneath the Tortured Lands , outside the Sharnwall . Lorosfyr ran for 90 miles (140 kilometers) from east to west and had an average width of 10 miles (16 kilometers). Lorosfyr was very deep, at some points reaching up to 40 miles (64 kilometers) in depth. The chasm was connected to the caves of the Buried Realms .</p>
<p>On the western side of the chasm, a wide and well-made thoroughfare circled Lorosfyr. At intervals, massive staircases punctuated the road, leading down into the depths of the chasm. It was unknown who constructed both the road and the stairs.</p>
