<p>Niferns were scaly dog -like creatures often kept by scalykind .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Niferns were roughly goat -sized quadrupeds with a muscular body covered in mud-colored scales. Their eyeless heads looked like strange hybrids of those of canines and lizards, featuring elongated muzzles and oversized jaws. Additionally, their plated dog-like tails featured poisonous stingers, and were carried over their backs, much like those of scorpions .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Although blind, niferns' heightened sense of smell made them excellent trackers.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>The niferns' appetite made them bloodthirsty creatures, attacking almost anything they encountered.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Niferns fought by rushing their opponents, attacking with their immobilizing poisonous stingers. Creatures that withstood the paralyzing effect were then attacked with their claws and jaws.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>In the wild, niferns were known to form highly territorial packs of upwards of 30 individuals, typically led by the largest and strongest among their number.</p>
<p>Niferns were popular among scalykind. In particular, lizardfolk , troglodytes , and dragonkin frequently kept them as hunting animals, and yuan-ti additionally kept them as guards.</p>
<p>In their native Underdark , niferns were used as trackers by the likes of illithids , drow , and a number of other underground races.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On Flamerule 3 , 1479 DR , a pack of niferns stalked Harp , Kitto , Boult , and Verran through the ruined city of Hisari .</p>
