<p>Corollaxes were mischievous magical birds found in temperate forests and jungles, such as those found on the Chultan Peninsula .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Corollaxes were sexually dimorphic: males typically had bright red, orange, and yellow feathers while females had brown or gray plumage. Common to both sexes was a curved, black-gray beak and black eyes.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As natural mimics, corollaxes could be trained to repeat words and phrases, though they lacked the intelligence to understand what they were saying. They were so fond of repeating learned phrases that many trainers came to regret the effort they put in—the birds often would not shut up. When threatened, a corollax could unleash a magical spray attack not unlike the spell color spray .</p>
<p>Silver weapons were especially harmful to corollaxes.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Naturally curious and social, corollaxes were not aggressive and would only attack in self-defense or if harassed. They made excellent companions and pets to travelers who avoided startling them. A trained corollax could make a very loyal companion so long as it received enough attention, food, and grooming.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>When startled or threatened, a corollax's natural defensive reaction was to unleash its color spray to ward off their attacker. If pressed, the bird would attack using its talons.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>The diet of a corollax consisted mainly of insects.</p>
