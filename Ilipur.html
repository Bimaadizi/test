<p>Ilipur was a large port town located on the south-western shore of the Lake of the Dragons . Along with Pros , the towns were called the "eyes and ears of Elversult ".</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Ilipur had a shallow harborage with no real docks. Trade ships' cargoes needed to be unloaded onto flat barges and dragged to shore. New ships were constructed on land and pushed into the sea as the town did not have dry docks.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Ilipur was ruled by the Council of Burghers and a lord mayor. The lord mayor was in charge of the city's sheriffs, tax collectors, inspectors, and accountants, and all suffered from nepotism. Traders from Elversult fully expected to pay fees and bribes to Burghers. They had little choice if they wanted to keep the cargo from the hands of local thieves and bandits.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Ilipur and Pros served as loading and unloading points for Elversult's trade.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1370 DR , the port towns of Ilipur and its neighbor, Pros, were used by the Cult of the Dragon for the smuggling of magical items , scrolls , material components , and other goods that the Cult required in the areas of the Dragon Coast . This operation made Ilipur a stage for numerous plots by the Cult, and opposing them were the Harpers , Astorians of Teziir , and the Night Masks of Westgate .</p>
<p>By 1372 DR , thieves of the Purple Masks Guild and slaver-bandits of the Men of the Basilisk were present in the town and preyed on trade cargo unprotected by the Council of Burghers.</p>
<p>Following the calamity known as the Spellplague , by 1479 DR , the town was doomed because of the receding waters of the Sea of Fallen Stars and Dragonmere . With the livelihood gone, the trading town dried up and blew away.</p>
<p>Ilipur came to be known as Haunted Ilipur during that time. The empty seaport was littered with overturned skeletons of decaying ships. The town was not fully abandoned, however. A band of pirates called the Blue Dawn was in control of the remnants of Ilipur.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>The town had a small handful of fair inns and taverns. There were no temples, but a few shrines to Umberlee , Lliira , Tymora , and Tyr .</p>
