<p>The Hall of Scrolls and Ledgers was a room inside Castle Obarskyr in 1357 DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It was distant from the Chamber of the Brazen Fool .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The wards in the chamber were powerful enough to give Vangerdahast pause and keep him from so much as attempting any spellcasting.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On Marpenoth 17 1357 DR , Vangerdahast was informed of a hand merged with the floor of the Hall of Scrolls and Ledgers. This alarmed him, because of the extensive and thorough wards on the place; the hand later turned out to belong to a Red Wizard of Thay named Adrelgus .</p>
