<p>Sapra was the only port city on the isle of Ilighôn of the Eyes of Silvanus , in the Sea of Fallen Stars , off the shores of the Vilhon Reach .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sapra was the only port on the entire island. The city was calm, quiet, and possibly, the cleanest settlement in all of Faerûn . The city was considered to be one of the most expensive places in the Vilhon Reach.</p>
<p>The city welcomed those who wanted to flee oppression by wizards. Sapra aided refugees from the lands ruled by spell-casting tyrants, and its inhabitants even included several "retired" Red Wizards who fled Thay . The island's magics shielded the ex-wizards from Thayan divinations .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Sapra stood on a small bay on the southeast of Ilighôn, directly in front of the cape passage gap in the reefs of Eldath's Ring that encircled the island. The Great Forest and Mielikki's Garden surrounded the city on land, while its harbors were awash with waters of the Sea of Fallen Stars through the Strait of Silvanus and the Farshore Straits . The Hierophant trail led from the city of Sapra towards the Oakenhall , or the House of Silvanus at the heart of the island. The Lake Bluesprings stood to the west from Sapra. The lake was a popular getaway for the city folk and indicated the unspoken border past which locals never ventured deeper into Ilighôn's wildwoods.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The city of Sapra was ruled and guarded by the druids of the Emerald Enclave who venerated both Silvanus and Eldath . Not a single unwanted nor unwelcome visitor was allowed to enter the harbors of Sapra under the druids' watchful eye. Direct rulership of Sapra was in the hands of a council of six elders whose position on the council was a part-time job. The council met as the need arose, usually once a month. In the late-14 th century DR, the leader of the council was the local blacksmith, Mayor Thomas Flagcairn .</p>
<p>The city of Sapra was mandated by the Emerald Enclave to control its size and population. In the late-14 th century, Sapra's population was at 2,000 souls, pushing the Emerald Enclave's limits. Due to the number and growing size, the town's lodging and housing prices were on the rise as well. However, by the later parts of the 1370s DR, Sapra's population expanded dramatically to over 3,000 souls.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Sapra's export was humble and consisted mainly of foodstuff and various herbs , all produced by the island's lush forests. The slow trade only had a handful of merchant ships docking in Sapra every month. Because of that, most things not produced locally were valued highly. Locals spent a lot of time negotiating trades and bartering.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Sapra's harbors and waters surrounding the isle of Ilighôn were defended by the Seven Sentinels of Silvanus , a group of water and air elementals who pummeled unwanted visitors and washed ashore allies whose vessels suffered damage or drowning innocents. The Seven Sentinels also guided friendly ships across the perilous reefs of Eldath's Ring towards Sapra. Additionally, Sapra, just like the entirety of Ilighôn, was shrouded in the faith-magic zone , a gift from Mystra , goddess of magic, to Silvanus. While on the island, all arcane magic was negated, permanent and long-lasting spells fizzled out, and wizardly magic items stopped functioning.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Sapra had been peacefully existing under the control, protection, and policies of the Emerald Enclave for over 200 years. The city existed under strict growth and expansion limitations mandated by the Emerald Enclave. In the period of time from 1360 to 1370 DR, not a single new building permit was issued in Sapra, explaining the astronomical process of homes, land, and lodging. The borders of the city were laid out circa 1320 DR and were never again adjusted by the city's green masters until Sapra was finally allowed to expand by the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<p>Everything changed with the advent of the Spellplague that reshaped the Vilhon Reach and drained the Sea of Fallen Stars. The Eyes of Silvanus were no longer islands, instead becoming the new edge of Turmish and later its only port city. In the 100 years that followed, the city's population exploded to more than double its size—8,500 souls included the locals, druids, and Turamis. In the Year of the Narthex Murders, 1482 DR , the Second Sundering undid the changes and scars of the magical calamity, returning the Vilhon Reach to its former shape, making Sapra a secluded port of the isle of Ilighôn once more.</p>
