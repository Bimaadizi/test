<p>The Shattered Flail was a magic club , that at some point was a fully-functional flail that belonged to a flind member of the cult of the Absolute .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Shattered Flail was a crude club-shaped bundle of bones, fixed together by tight leather things. The club itself was merely a handle of a flind's broken flail.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Shattered Flail bore foul magic of Yeenoghu , the demon lord worshiped by gnolls . The dark magic was so potent, it was almost palpable, granting the makeshift club a +2 enchantment. The same demonic taint also healed a small portion of the wielder's health if the weapon successfully hit its target. Unfortunately, the Shattered Flail also infected its wielder with bloodlust, forcing them to use the Flail to attack their opponent. If the wielder chose not to deal damage with it, there was a chance that the bloodlust turned into madness.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the Shattered Flail was in possession of a blood-hungry flind gnoll ravager in service of the cult of the Absolute. She led a squad of gnolls and hyenas on attacks against caravans traveling along the trade way from Elturel to Baldur's Gate , across the Western Heartlands . One such caravan was transporting a group of Zhentarim smugglers to their secret base under Waukeen's Rest . With the caravan raided, the Zhenths escaped and fended for their life against the blind and rabid followers of the Shattered Flail' s owner.</p>
