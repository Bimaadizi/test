<p>Izco the Elder , or Izco the First was the Revered Counselors of the great Nexalan empire whose rule started almost exactly 100 years before the arrival of the Golden Legion in 1361 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Izco was elevated to the Nexalan throne after the death of Revered Counselor Zomoc in the Year of Bright Dreams, 1261 DR . He was selected by the nobility of Nexal due to being a descendant of the great Revered Counsellor Ipana and a nephew of general Coyo who was sacrificed to the Bloody Zaltec by Zomoc in the Year of the Killing Wave, 1257 DR .</p>
<p>Tenth Revered Counselor of Nexal, Izco the Elder's rule was similar to that of his son – filled with cultural growth and artistic growth. Under his rule, the trade relationship with Pezelac was made consistent and reliable while Huacli and other subjugated settlements continued to pay tribute to Nexal. This period of time was known for the highest number of bloody sacrifices, men and women, to the god of war Zaltec , using the tribute slaves from the conquered states. Seldomly subjugated rates attempted to rebel against Nexal. Those who dated were faced with Nexal's armies and a higher number of sacrifices, while states that attempted to negotiate night number of sacrifices were dealt with more leniently.</p>
<p>A rare occurrence in Nexala history – the rulership was passed from Izco the Elder to his son, Izco II , while the Revered Counselor was still alive. To celebrate the passing of the throne, Izco the First added a layer to the Great Pyramid of Zaltec, making it even higher and cementing its status as the highest man-made structure in Maztica .</p>
<p>It was celebrated by carving out a thousand hearts in the glory of the Bloody God, a tame number by all accords. The humble sacrifice angered the cruel deity, and the volcano of Mount Zatal awoke. The mountain retched lava onto Nexal and into the waters of the great Lake Tezca . The lake's waves battered the island where Nexal stood as well as the Valley of Nexal 's lowlands. The destruction was minimal as most stone buildings affected remained standing and the havoc avoided most grown crops. The death toll of the disaster was several hundred Nexala. Without wasting time, zealous priests of Zaltec started another Feathered War against the cities of the Valley of Nexal. All city-states took ten thousand men and women from their homes, and all were immediately butchered in honor of Zaltec. When the Feathered War was over, and the Nexala atoned, Izco the Second took the throne of the Revered Counselor.</p>
<p>Izco the Elder spent the rest of his life as a poet and songster as well as learned to weave pluma . And his son's reign ended less than forty years after Izco the Elder ascended on the throne.</p>
