<p>The Sosser was a mixed-breed of unsophisticated horses found throughout Thar and the Cold Lands in northeast Faerûn . They were a cross between a steppe horse and other breeds that were favorable for farming.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These horses were sure-footed, strong and highly resilient to the freezing colds of the north. They had long necks, narrow heads and broad hooves.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Heavily bred in the harsh farms of the cold northern lands of Faerûn, Sossers were capable of pulling a wagon alone, where two work-horses were typically required. They were quite inexpensive, and could be purchased for around 90 gp .</p>
