<p>Persistent maggots! This cloak's illusions may not have been enough to fool you, but my magic is more than capable of turning you inside out - just like it did those wretched priestesses! Prepare to die!</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Skyrim was a hulking humanoid creature in appearance, with demonically red skin, dark hair, and a pair of stubby horns. His eyes were black with white pupils and teeth and claws - as dark as obsidian .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Skyrim Bloodfang found a powerful Leiran artifact called the Cloak of Mysteries and used its illusory magics to scare off anyone brave enough to enter the ruined temple. The ogre also wielded an enchanted +1 greatsword and carried a masterfully crafted set of thieves' tools .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , The Hidden House of Leira was lost and ruined. The temple's once sacred chambers were claimed by the scarlet oni mage called Skyrim. He and his ogre and orc henchmen laired in the ruins, and the oni mage used illusions to send images of ghostly Leiran priestesses to warn, scare, and intimidate unwanted visitors off. During that year, a charismatic thief Garrett the Bold uncovered a way to enter the hidden temple. He was joined by a group of adventurers as his muscle in order to loot the temple while Garrett himself searched for a famed Leiran artifact â€“ the Cloak of Mysteries . The adventurers found a way to Skyrim and may have successfully liberated the ruin from its ogreish inhabitants, possibly claiming the artifact as their own.</p>
