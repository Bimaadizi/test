<p>Ramos was the paramount of the storm giant aerie of Lake Woe mountain in 1366 DR .</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1364 DR , a festival was held in honor of Ramos, who at that time was of second rank in the ordning . During the feast, the sun shone on the aerie for the first time in ten years, and this was seen as a omen that Ramos was to replace the current paramount as the new leader.</p>
<p>By 1369 DR , Ramos was no longer paramount, having been replaced by a giant named Anastes . Anastes, Ramos, and four others were summoned magically by Lanaxis to defend him when he needed to rest during his kidnapping of Queen Brianna and her son Kaedlaw . They heeded his call. Ramos and a giant named Nikol cooked a moose for Brianna to eat, but during this time, Tavis Burdun and armies of giant-kin attacked. Nikol and Ramos were ordered by Anastes to deal with the verbeegs . Ramos' fate in the ensuing battle was never recorded.</p>
