<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before the Cult of the Dragon's arrival in 1369 DR , Tarbash and his cousin, Robalend Lukka, made a living by scavenging the ruins of Myth Drannor. However, that vocation was cut short when the cultists took over the ruins, and Robalend was captured.</p>
<p>A month after, by chance, Tarbash Dellkisel encountered a group of heroes who were searching for enslaved villages taken to the ruins of Myth Drannor. He saw them moving along a path from the Shrine of Mystra to the City of Song's Polyandrium and called out to them from thick bushes. He warned the adventurers of the Cult of the Dragon patrolling the area and advised a more stealthy approach. Tarbash agreed to help the heroes in exchange for their help in rescuing the unlucky cousin. Together with them, Tarbash made way to the Tower of Bones , the center of Cult's operations in the Polyandrium. The group managed to gain access to the tower's roof, where they confronted several cultists and the High Priest Ryngoth. They arrived just in time to rescue Robalend Lukka from being killed and raised as mindless undead servant of the Cult.</p>
<p>Thankful for the rescue, both gnomes decided to aid the heroes in the struggle against the Cult of the Dragon, and getting access to newly unsealed treasure-filled tombs of Polyandrium was a nice incentive. Subsequently, the gnomes and the adventurers managed to sneak into Castle Cormanthor and destroy the phylactery of a dracolich Pelendralaar , leading to the Cult's downfall at the hands of the Veiled Ones .</p>
