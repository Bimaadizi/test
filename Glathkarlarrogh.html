<h2>History</h2>
<p>Glathkarlarrogh carried the mage Undarl to Heldon , where the sorcerer was to kill Prince Elthryn Aumar . Along the way, they were spotted by the man's child, Elminster Aumar , whom Undarl interrogated and left for dead. In turn, Elminster saw Glathkarlarrogh eat a few sheep on the way to Heldon. Once in Heldon, Glathkarlarrogh caused much of the destruction with its flame breath and its rampaging, ultimately slaying Elthryn with its dragonfire when Undarl's spells proved susceptible to being thwarted by the man's weapon, the Lion Sword . The dragon's breath also shattered the sword; unknown to the dragon or his steed, its destruction was what first drew the attention of Mystra to Elminster's situation.</p>
<p>After the siege of Hastarl that ended in the death of King Belaur Aumar , the sorceress Myrjala Talithyn took Elminster to a nearby shrine of Mystra where the two of them knew Undarl had stashed some of his magic. The dragon, which had not made itself present through the siege, lay in wait there. On Undarl's signal, it tried to attack Myrjala with its flame breath; however, her shield did not just leave her unharmed, it exploded the dragon on the spot.</p>
