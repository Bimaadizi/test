<p>The mines of Tethyamar were once home to one of the greatest dwarven communities in north Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The mines of Tethyamar were very deep, following the long vertical veins of ore that lay beneath the Desertsmouth Mountains . Along these descending ore-veins chains of chambers were constructed that made up the housing, forges, tombs and storage areas of the dwarves of Tethyamar. This design resulted in a far more widespread dwarf hold compared to others of its kind.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Early trade in Tethyamar was primarily with its nearest neighboring realms. These included Anauria , Asram , Avaeraether , Cormanthyr and Hlondath . After a few centuries its trading connections had expanded to include Cormyr , Hlontar , Myth Drannor , Merrydale , Northkeep and Teshar .</p>
<p>With their forged goods, ore and riches, Tethyamar prospered from its ever-growing trade until the founding of Flostren's Hold in 747 DR . After Flostren's Hold under the sway of a consortium of wizards, known as the Zhentarim , fierce competition between the two mining nations erupted.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Due to Tethyamar's scattered design, the Kingdom was much harder to defend as enemies could target isolated areas easily. However the dwarves tended to be much more self-reliant and hardy because of the far-flung nature of their home.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>In Tethyamar culture it was common for dwarves from many different clans to live and work together. Thus comportment and solidarity as a "Tethyamar dwarf" tended to be more important than bloodlines or heritage.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early history</h3>
<p>Located in the northern Desertsmouth Mountains , these wondrous mines and caverns were founded in the Year of Depths Unknown, −145 DR by Roryn , blood of Thordbard , of the Iron House of fallen Oghrann . Generations of dwarfs carved out magnificent halls and looted the earth of her valuables, selling them to humans and elves , sending rafts of riches down the River Tesh to the Moonsea and beyond.</p>
<p>During this early period, Tethyamar was continually beset by attacks from orcs , hobgoblins and ogres as they carved out their kingdom. Despite their resilience Tethyamar briefly fell to orcs from the Dragonspine Mountains in Year of Hostile Hails, −88 DR before the dwarves reclaimed their halls in Year of Goodfields, −86 DR . This close defeat caused the Tethyamar dwarves to sponsor the construction of the fortress-city Rulvadar , to protect against further attacks.</p>
<h3>Fall of Tethyamar</h3>
<p>Tethyamar perished however in the Year of the Dark Dawn, 1104 DR . After more than a decade of resistance, Tethyamar was entirely overwhelmed by legion of orcs and goblins , along with their vicious barghest beasts and demonic allies. This invading force was led by the self-proclaimed Great Hlundadim leader of the old goblinoid kingdom that bore his name .</p>
<p>The surviving dwarves of the Iron House fled to the dwarven communities of the Far Hills and Storm Horns of Cormyr . Of the royal family, only the king's youngest son, Ghellin had survived.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR Borlin , blood of Ghellin, mustered a dwarf army known as the Mithril Legion to reclaim Tethyamar for the Iron House, but the force was defeated.</p>
<p>Ghellin died in exile, reportedly in the Far Hills , of a wasting disease that resisted all medicinal and clerical cures. With the death of Ghellin, the leadership of the Iron House passed to his twin sons Tasster and Teszter .</p>
<p>Nevertheless, dwarves in the lands around the Sea of Fallen Stars continued to speak of and work towards the day when “the king shall take his throne again.”</p>
<p>By the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the Zhentarim under the command of Kara Chermosk occupied one of the upper fortresses of Tethyamar and reopened mining operations.</p>
