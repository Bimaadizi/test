<p>The Swords of Espar was an adventuring company from the city of Espar in the nation of Cormyr , active in the early-to-mid 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Swords of Espar were founded decades before the Year of the Spur, 1348 DR . Over the adventuring group's carer, the Swords of Espar gained fame and status. The ballad retelling the Swords' fierce battle with the dragon Azazarrundoth , known as the Dragondown Slaying , was performed monthly by Cormyrean minstrels . In 1348 DR, a band of young heroes from Espar, sponsored by King Azoun Obarskyr IV , attempted to register their adventuring charter under the name of the Swords of Espar. However, the Charter Law in Cormyr forbade the registration of a new charter license using existing adventuring companies' names. At the time, some of the members of the Swords were still alive, including Mlaareth , who resided in Suzail and enjoyed wealth and attention. Undermaster of the Rolls and Scribe Royal Blaunel was greatly amused at the fact that youth from Espar was not aware of the famed adventuring band. The youths eventually settled on the name of the Swords of Eveningstar .</p>
