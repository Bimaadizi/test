<p>Ivan Bouldershoulder was a dwarf adventurer of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR and brother to Pikel Bouldershoulder .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ivan had a long yellow beard, square shoulders, and dark eyes. He had a long, wide nose.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ivan and his brother Pikel were born and raised in Vaasa , in the rugged Galena Mountains .</p>
<p>In the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR , Ivan and Pikel fought alongside the elves of Shilmista against invading orcs and goblins .</p>
<p>Later, they resided at Spirit Soaring , a temple to Deneir in the Snowflake Mountains , with Cadderly Bonaduce and his wife Danica .</p>
<p>Ivan and Pikel set out from Carradoon to attend the coronation of King Bruenor Battlehammer in Mithral Hall in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR . They were captured by the moon elves of the Moonwood (specifically Innovindil and Tarathiel ) and were held captive for a few days. Upon the elves' determining that they meant no harm to the elves or the forest, the two were released and proceeded to Mithral Hall .</p>
<p>In the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , Ivan's mind was taken over by the dracolich Yharaskrik . Ivan later regained control of his body and escaped into the tunnels of the mountains.</p>
<p>Ivan and Pikel later returned to the Bloodstone Lands together, this time to Helgabal in Damara , where he served as a guard commander and master-at-arms in the Damaran army by 1484 DR , repeatedly proving himself as one of the best warriors in the city, but finding many of his duties increasingly dull and uninteresting, especially considering his quiet disdain for King Yarin Frostmantle .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Rune Lords Triumphant, 1487 DR , Ivan found himself caught up in a conspiracy in the Damaran royal court when he was reunited with Regis and Wulfgar , who were both in Helgabal on the orders of the Morada Topolino to save Queen Concettina Delcasio from execution by her cruel husband, who was infertile, but blamed her for his failure to produce an heir to the throne. Convinced that they'd be unable to get her out of the country without provoking a war between Damara and Aglarond , Ivan instead agreed to facilitate Wulfgar's access to the queen's bedchamber so that she could conceive a child by him, and pass off their child as the king's. Ivan and Pikel were both arrested by Yarin's forces for their association with Wulfgar when Yarin found out he'd been cuckolded.</p>
<p>After the death of King Yarin, Ivan and Pikel moved back west, to Longsaddle , where Ivan was given the task of guarding the portal from the Ivy Mansion to Gauntlgrym . Once Gauntlgrym's portal network was properly secured, Ivan became one of the first three captains of the city's Grymguard , sitting in council with King Bruenor's closest advisors.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Ivan wore plate mail in combat, with a metal helm adorned with deer antlers. He carried a replica hand crossbow of the type used by the drow , with a bandoleer of crossbow bolts, each fitted with a vial of oil of impact , and a heavy axe across his back. He carried hand axes attached to his belt.</p>
