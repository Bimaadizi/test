<p>Investigator Valeria was a hollyphant who served the god Helm in Mount Celestia . For a very brief time, she worked as a detective for the Flaming Fist of Baldur's Gate during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like other hollyphants, Valeria appeared as a miniature golden, flying elephant with four feathered wings that extended out from the rear of her head. She wore a small fabric cap, a single monocle over her right eye and always kept a pipe jutting out her mouth adjacent her right tusk.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Valeria had strong opinions about her fellow residents of Celestia. She believed they held no grand understanding on the nature of good nor evil , and did not believe her fellows immune to the corrupting nature of the latter.</p>
<p>Despite her celestial nature, Valeria was not especially wise nor courageous. She was in fact something of a hapless drunkard. Valeria tended to drown her sorrows in ale and wine especially when she was unable to properly solve a case.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Valeria always made sure to keep a spare pipe handy.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The opinionated hollyphant penned her own personal memoirs about her time in Mount Celestia, entitled Mastodonian Memoirs .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She thought her fellow hollyphant Lulu to be rather naive and foolish.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Valeria became exceptionally concerned when the solar Zariel was dispatched to the Nine Hells to observe the status of the Blood Wars . She believed that Zariel would not be the only celestial being corrupted by its malign influence.</p>
<p>At some point, Valeria was dispatched to the Feywild to investigate some unknown matter. She was pulled off assignment for "disorderly drinking" and "spreading conspiracy."</p>
<p>She was reassigned to the city of Baldur's Gate on the world of Toril, in the Faer√ªnian Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , to investigate the Descent of Elturel , as it was pulled down to the plane of Avernus . Over the course of a tenday , she was assigned by the local Flaming Fist authorities to investigate three cases: the death of Waveservant Holli Dylford , a murderer who took the hands of their victims, and what was referred to by Baldur's Mouth as the "Ol' Cholms'" case.</p>
