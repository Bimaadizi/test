<p>Imbrus I was the 38th Obarskyr monarch and a king of Cormyr . Like so many of his relatives, he was murdered by Gorauna . A common-born man named Rathdar Orlenthar ruled Cormyr as regent until Imbrus' cousins or son would come of age. All three, however, died in the Purplethroat Plague , and an Obarskyr would not sit on the throne again until 341 DR .</p>
