<p>Giant rats , also known as dire rats , were a species of large rodent.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Giant rats were much larger than the common rat , most growing to the size of a large dog. They were covered in coarse fur that was brown-black in color.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Giant rats worked exceptionally well in groups, taking advantage of their numbers to attack more efficiently. They attacked a target by biting them with its sharp incisors. Giant rats avoided attacking stronger creatures, especially those wielding fire, unless driven by extreme hunger or compelled to do so by a wererat or vampire . Giant rats were excellent swimmers, as such they were just as dangerous in the water as they were on land.</p>
<p>The bite of these creatures carried a potentially lethal disease known as filth fever . It was recommended that victims of giant rat bites sought immediate clerical attention.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Giant rats were common found in subterranean areas such as crypts, dungeons and sewers. They were also found in great numbers within graveyards, where they dug a network of tunnel to gain access to the corpses found within.</p>
<p>Some were raised to be mounts by the Tasloi , alongside spider eaters .</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Giant rats could be found in the wild in the Silver Marches , particularly in the Rauvin Vale and Sundabar Vale , as well as in the High Forest . In urban environments they were commonly found in sewers , though they were liable to migrate elsewhere if a water cat moved into their territory.</p>
<p>Beyond the Prime Material plane , giant rats could be found in the Domains of Dread .</p>
<h3>Summoning</h3>
<p>With the spell summon nature's ally I a single dire rat could be called forth. A fiendish giant rat could be summoned with the summon monster I spell.</p>
