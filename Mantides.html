<p>Mantides was a former paladin of Lathander living in Westgate around 1374 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Mantides was a pious man who respected the dead as dictated by his Lathanderian faith and veneration of Kelemvor .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>When he served the church of Lathander , Mantides wore an expensive suit of armor he had gotten rid of after it was stained with shame and blood of his victims. He wielded a holy enchanted sword called the Dawnbringer .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mantides's lover Tasheni disappeared while investigating the Night Masks , so Mantides decided to focus on destroying the evil guild. One day, Mantides was sent by Lady Sunrise Tylanna of the Morningstar Haven to the Sword Lane . Rumors had it that the Night Masks claimed one of the abandoned warehouses there as their warehouse. He quickly confirmed that the warehouse was indeed occupied by the Night Masks. Instead of returning to Tylanna, Mantides became consumed by vengeance. In his zeal, he viciously killed eight young Night Mask members with one escaping, the event called the Sword Lane massacre of the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , and for this he was expelled from the church of Lathander, leaving him a broken man, often drowning his sorrows in ale .</p>
<p>Around the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Mantides was said to had joined an adventurer who had just recently arrived at Westgate to fight the Night Masks. The adventurer witnessed Mantides being harassed by Screeb and other drunken ruffians in the Black Eye tavern in Westgate harbor. The drunkards accused Mantides of being a washed-out drunk, insinuated he lost his holy sword and that the church took his manhood when it stripped Mantides of paladinhood. Despite harassment, Mantides did not stoop to violence.</p>
<p>Mantides did not recognize the adventurer, but their other companion, a woman named Rinara , looked familiar. She revealed that she left Westgate three years prior, right after the Sword Lane massacre. Mantides realized that the one Night Mask who escaped the massacre was Rinara. The fallen paladin restrained his rage, believing Rinara's words of not being responsible for Tasheni's death.</p>
