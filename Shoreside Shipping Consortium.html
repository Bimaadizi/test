<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1372 DR , Mariners' Alliance stoke a profitable trading deal via Shoreside Shipping Consortium. Barracuda was involved in regular shippings of weapons and armor that passed through Daggerford. Suspiciously enough, Barracuda's final destination was omitted from the logs kept in Mariners' Alliance guildhall.</p>
<p>Astriel Shalyn , an agent of the Lords' Alliance suspected foul play and asked a group of adventurers allied with her to investigate the Mariners' Alliance. The adventurers infiltrated the guildhall, eventually recovering the thick ledger that led them to Shoreside Shipping Consortium's vessel Barracuda .</p>
<p>This led them to discover the Mariners' Alliance affiliation with Zhentarim in the evil organization's intricate plot of taking over Daggerford's rulership. Shoreside Shipping Consortium's vessel Barracuda was smuggling numerous shipments of weapons and armor to the orc and tanarukk hordes swelling outside the city preparing an invasion, with Zhentarim's sponsorship.</p>
