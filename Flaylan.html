<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Flaylan and Derg were found in the quarters next to the kitchens of Firkraag's Maze. When Abdel Adrian was lured into the dungeon, he and his companions confronted the duo of orcs. Flaylan and Derg begged for mercy and showed no aggression towards the Bhaalspawn , claiming to had only been following their master's orders. It was unrecorded if the adventurers spared the duo of orcs , allowing them to the Windspear Hills.</p>
