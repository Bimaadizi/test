<h2>History</h2>
<p>Long before the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , dragon's belt was commissioned by the barbarian white dragon hunter named Edhan. His tribe's shaman successfully weaved defensive magics into the item that accompanied Edhan into his many fruitful hunts for young whites. Edhan and his magic belt continued to hunt dragons across the Icewind Dale tundra and gained unmeasurable wealth by the standards of his people. When he reached fifty-six winter, Edhan was slain by two young whites, all of his equipment, including the belt was still on the barbarian's body when it was found by the fellow Tribe of the Great Wyrm barbarians. The dragon-hunter's body was interred in a traditional manner, but the belt and the rest of the equipment – sold and traded away.</p>
