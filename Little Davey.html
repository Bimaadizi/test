<p>Little Davey was the man who ran the Black Eye tavern and festhall in the city of Westgate in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Little Davey's name was a misnomer, as the man stood 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall and had a very muscular build. While behind the bar, he was covered in sweat, grime, and ale . Davey did not like spreading rumors or chatting up guests, however, he was willing to share information in exchange for some coin .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Little Davey was in charge of the Black Eye and co-owned it with two huge bouncer brothers Gregory and Marv . Despite the establishment being a tavern without any rental rooms, Little Davey allowed customers to just plunk themselves in the corner of the taproom along with other drunkards sleeping the revelry off. At that time, Davey also employed a dancer named Dimples . One day she stopped showing up for work. Being a popular entertainer, many customers had been asking for Dimples. Marv was worried for the woman and asked a band of adventurers to look into the dancer's disappearance. It turned out Dimples was a member of the city guard and twisted her ankle on the line of duty, rendering her unable to dance until the wound was healed.</p>
