<p>A claw bracer was a type of exotic weapon that took the form of a series of claws over the wielder's hand.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was a metal armband or bracer with steel claws that projected over the back of the wielder's hand, to a length of some 4 inches (10 centimeters) past their outstretched fingers. They ended in stabbing points. It weighed 2 pounds (0.9 kilograms).</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The blades were as damaging as daggers , but the claw bracer was an exotic weapon to learn.</p>
<p>The bracer design made it impossible for the wielder to be disarmed in combat.</p>
<p>As their hand was kept free, a spellcaster could cast spells normally whilst armed with a claw bracer.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>By 1369 DR , the use of claw bracers rose in popularity among the sorcerers and wizards of the Cult of the Dragon . Many members of the cult's cell that occupied Myth Drannor were outfitted with these bracers, both mundane, and of +1 and +2 enchantment. Some more uncommon claw bracers were a variation on bracers of armor .</p>
<p>The claw bracer was the signature weapon of the orc goddess Luthic , symbolizing her long claws; the Faerûnian god Malar , for a beast's claw; the Faerûnian goddess Sharess , symbolizing a cat's paw; and the gnome god Urdlen , symbolizing his great claw.</p>
