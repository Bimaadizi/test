<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kulzar's Alley was named after the Waterdhavian sailor Kulzar , captain of the Lost Luck , a ship that had broken up during a stormy night after running into shoals near Waterdeep.

<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>It was rumored that Kulzar's treasure lay buried somewhere under the alley. Although the treasure had never been found, the legend attracted occasional treasure hunters and old sailors. However, any digging taking place in the alley was quickly stopped by the City Watch , whose main interest was to prevent tunnels from being dug under the Trollwall . Perpetrators were required to close off any dig sites and replace any removed pavement stones.</p>
