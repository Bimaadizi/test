<p>Darribeth Meltimer was a mage and adventurer of Amphail on the Sword Coast North who became lost in the Underdark in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>Darribeth was the wife and adventuring companion of Urgala . Another former adventuring companion was Harthos Zymorven .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>While on an expedition in the Underdark, a fellow adventurer was killed and Darribeth became lost. The quasit Teeha , posing as a talking toad that Darribeth did not quite remember meeting, teased her with promises of escape that proved false.</p>
<p>A decade later, in 1492 DR , Darribeth found herself in the Twisted Caverns of Undermountain , always with Teeha at her side tormenting her. Teeha told her that hezrou demons were close by to prevent her leaving. There, she may have at last been found and rescued by adventurers if they killed or drove away the toad. If so, and they restored her sanity, she would travel to Amphail and then Triboar and finally have a happy reunion with Urgala at Northshield House .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>After contact with demons , Darribeth had gone mad, being afflicted with paranoia and having hallucinations , though she desperately wanted to escape and be back with Urgala. If a greater restoration spell was applied on her, Darribeth regained lucidity. She was a curious and kind woman who didn't care about breaking the rules if needed to do good.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was slight of build and had long black hair. After living years in the Underdark, her robes were gray and tatty, as was the cloth she used to tie back her hair.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Darribeth still had her spellbook , containing spells such as cone of cold , darkvision (which aided in her Underdark travels), fireball , fly , greater invisibility , ice storm , tongues , water breathing , and others.</p>
<p>She kept it, material components , a dagger , canteen, a blanket, and 11 gp in a pouch with a backpack with a broken strap. She also had a rope of climbing retrieved from her slain companion.</p>
