<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point between 1367 DR and 1479 DR , House Chûmavh moved into the huge cavern beneath the city and built Tower Chûmavhraele. In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Dresimil was supervising the re-activation of the ancient drow mythal in the cavern when her drow accidentally released the rogue Jack Ravenwild from his imprisonment inside the mythal.</p>
<p>Jack escaped and Dresimil devoted some resources to recapturing Jack. Ultimately, she lent drow warriors to the slaver Fetterfist for an attack on a social gathering of Ravens Bluff nobles.</p>
<p>The attack was repelled and a large force led by Myrkyssa Jelan descended to the Underdark to free nobles captured in the raid and Dresimil was killed by Myrkyssa during the battle.</p>
