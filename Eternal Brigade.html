<p>The Eternal Brigade was a group of battlerager dwarves at home in ancient Myth Drannor . Though they died in the Weeping War , their oaths kept their spirits trapped in the ruins afterwards.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Elven Crusade in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the Cormanthor Elves were directed by the guardnorn Phathroi towards an old Cult of the Dragon base , where the Red Wizards of Thay were using a ritual to control the dracolich Karliath . During the attack, the invaders found an otherwise untouched section of the old structure filled with long-fallen dead dwarves. Held solely by their oaths to defend the location, the Eternal Brigade animated as undead and attacked the newcomers. The defenders of Myth Drannor may have acquired the signature bracers of the battlerager from the twice-fallen dwarves.</p>
