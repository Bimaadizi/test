<p>Noromath was a duchy in name only, being the western half of the elven territory of the great Wealdath forest of Tethyr .</p>
<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>The name "Noromath" is Elvish for "Legacy of the North". It was called such by the Elmanesse elves of the forest.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Noromath's official borders were east of County Greenshores , south of Amn , west of Durmista , and north of County Uluran ; however, the elves cared little for such human distinctions.</p>
<h2>Population</h2>
<p>Noromath was the original home of the Elmanesse tribe of elves, who were refugees from Myth Drannor . Green elves from the Suldusk also occupied the region, since the tribes were unified. The major population of the western half of the forest, however, was composed of goblins , hobgoblins , centaurs , and satyrs .</p>
<p>A small population of humans lived in the town of Brost on the outskirts of the forest to the north.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>In 1370 DR , Allain "Foxfire" Kevanarial was the official representative of the Elmanesse tribes to the Tethyrian court. While officially a duke, he did not consider himself a duke at all, and he refused to declare any place his ducal seat.</p>
