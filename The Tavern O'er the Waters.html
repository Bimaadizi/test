<p>The Tavern O'er the Waters was a tavern in Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Unusually, the tavern was built as a bridge over the Delimbiyr River itself, with entrances at each end. This made it a handy way of getting around. One end lay near The Woodlands Inn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the Zhentarim and Zhentilar commanded by Vaalgamon invaded the streets of Loudwater in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , the Heroes of Ascore were able to use The Tavern O'er the Waters to get around where they'd blocked the street for an ambush.</p>
