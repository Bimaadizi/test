<p>A jawzah ( pronounced : / dʒ ɑː ə ˈ z ɑː / jauh-ZAH ) was a stringed fiddle-like Zakharan instrument.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Since coconuts were used for the soundbox of a jawzah , these instruments were popular among the sailors and travelers of the Golden Gulf and the ports surrounding it.</p>
