<p>The Baths of Garimsharr were a bathhouse ruin in Phoenix .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Baths of Garimsharr were a massive rose-colored building; it had three entrances, all of which led into a 10 feet (3 meters)wide gallery 10 feet (3 meters) above the ground; on the ground level, there were three pairs of 70 feet (21 meters) pillars leading to the ceiling. Those pillars were ornately carved to resemble legendary beasts; four pools lay between the pillars. Four more pools lay at the corners of the room, and there was a drain.</p>
<p>The drain led across a nest of red spiders towards a manhole, which opened before a statue of Set .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>About thirteen skeletons remained in reserve within the pools. A wraith , the spirit of Krinos Pandipolous , was hidden in the drain and would command the skeletons if it saw an opportunity to slay adventurers.</p>
