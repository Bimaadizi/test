<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sarutobi was already a famed fighter by the time he was to fight a duel with a stone giant . To aid the martial artist, a wealthy merchant of Shou Lung commissioned the creation of enchanted bracers , later to be known as Sarutobi's Stone Breakers . According to the story, Sarutobi passionately declined the gift, claiming that he needed no help in crushing the giant's skull. The martial artist survived the duel and won.</p>
<p>One day, Sarutobi stepped through a gate and disappeared into the planes , leaving a son behind. The merchant gifted the magic gauntlets to Sarutobi's son, who later went on a life-long quest to find his missing father. He never did.</p>
