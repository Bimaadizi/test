<p>Dran Draggore was a red dragon and the high priest of the Darkmoon temple in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hundreds of years before the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Dran had dark elves build the original Temple Darkmoon . They, however, ended up destroying themselves and Dran was greatly injured in the cataclysm. It took the dragon a long time to recover, and he later started rebuilding the temple. During this time, he met Xanathar , an evil beholder crime lord. They planned to rule Waterdeep together, but it turned out that he was used by Dran.</p>
<p>By the time Xanathar was slain, Dran had amassed his legion of undead . He was ready to unleash his army and kill Khelben Arunsun , but was confronted by the Heroes of Waterdeep . After a mighty battle, Dran collapsed to the floor. However, he grinned and started to rise, transforming from a humanoid into a red dragon. Eventually, the dragon was slain by the heroes, and Temple Darkmoon was destroyed.</p>
