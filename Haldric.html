<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the villagers of Nimbre were accused of being associated and corrupted by the much-hated yuan-ti , and the Samarach Patrol was rounding up the accused to stand trial in Samargol . Haldric, who was an outsider, felt little compassion for the doomed villagers. The loremaster considered the inhabitants of Nimbre to be dimwitted, and he only cared about the village remaining quiet to aid lore studies. Haldric did hide a dire secret. He was the dreaded yuan-ti that caused the village persecution. Haldric used a human guise to full most; however, his true identity could be exposed via a Zehir snake tattoo on his body.</p>
