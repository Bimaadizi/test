<p>The Coast of Cormyr was an informal region of the kingdom that consisted of the rural lands along the coast of the Dragonmere . Though home to the oldest human settlements in Cormyr , much of the coastal region remained a lightly-inhabited countryside of hidden villages and old, forgotten ruins.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The coast was a stretch of pastoral lands east of the kingdom's heartlands and south of the east reaches frontier, with many villages and hamlets but few towns. It largely consisted of rolling plains interspersed with small valleys and woodlands, the largest of which was the Hermit's Wood , and was watered by many rivers, streams, and marshlands. The lightly-populated coastline had plenty of coves and beaches suitable for landings, making it popular with smugglers and pirates despite the best efforts of the Blue Dragons and Purple Dragons .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The coast generally referred to the rural lands east of Marsember and the Starwater River , along the Way of the Manticore up to the border of Sembia at the Vast Swamp and Darkflow River . It contained part of the Eastern Plains , the large region of deforested plains along Cormyr's eastern frontier.</p>
