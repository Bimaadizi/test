<h2>History</h2>
<p>Larloch's Soul Stealer was created by the infamous necromancer and lich, Larloch. The ring was used to harvest souls for the undead mage's magical experiments. At some point before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Larloch's Soul Stealer was accepted by Mintassan the Magnificent. The planeswalking wizard added the precious ring to his collections of curios from across the worlds, displayed in Mintassan's Mysteries , his site on Westgate's Market Triangle . Mintassan warned the uninitiated to dabble with the ring's dangerous magics at their own peril.</p>
