<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following heavy Zhentarim losses in the Battle of Ascore in 1358 DR, the dwarven resistance, headed by Milzorr, incited a rebellion in Llorkh. Milzorr rallied his dwarven comrades, as well as the Heroes of Ascore , to swarm strategic parts of the town, as the Zhentarim forces were stretched. The dwarves managed to reclaim the city, but the Zhentarim once again quickly seized control, with Lord Geildarr Ithym retaining his leadership for the following few decades.</p>
