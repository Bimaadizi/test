<p>Thonn's Fist (also known as Vosos ) was the largest island in the Archipelago of Altumbel on the Sea of Fallen Stars .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The island's was a massive granite cliff, originally referred to in some primitive human tongue as "Raunshee", a name meaning "club-head". Beneath its surface, Thonn's Fist was tunneled out by its kobold inhabitants, possibly connecting to the Underdark on mainland. These tunnels were so extensive that many of them suffered collapses on the surface. At least one of these collapses left open to the sky a huge cavern, which had been used by the kobolds as a temple to Kurtulmak until rainwater filled the cavern, turning it into a shallow lake.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>The kobolds that made their home on Thonn's Fist grew fungi on both its surface and within their underground dirt chambers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in the 14 th century DR , as part of larger invasion of islands south of Altumbel a force of kobolds overran Thonn's Fist, driving out what few hermits or fisher-folk were living there. In the years that followed at least pirate raids were conducted against the island, both of which the kobolds managed to repulse.</p>
