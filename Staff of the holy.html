<h2>History</h2>
<p>Through the years, many of the most devoted worshipers of various gods found themselves in possession of staves of the holy , claiming these enchanted items were wills of their deities manifested in physical form. Sages thought these claims to be in doubt. However, these staves did find their way into the hands of truly righteous clerics over and over again, by accident or design. The sheer number of staves of the holy made claims of these items' divinity highly suspicious.</p>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR , staves of the holy were widespread across the Sword Coast and the Moonsea regions .</p>
