<p>Fishbroth was the only "food" item served at Skully's Bar and Bait tavern in the Harbor District of Ravens Bluff circa 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Fishbroth was sold at the decrepit tavern and a live fishing bait shop. Most customers who consumed this dish were local beggars due to its low price of only 1 cp (sometimes in exchange for their own toes and ears as Skully bought anything that could be used as bait).</p>
<p>Fishbroth was cooked by Skully, the tavern's owner, by reappropriating old and rotting bait. Old bait was cooked in water, chunks and bits of cheap salted fish , old sauces, and aromatics (rotting herbs , vegetables, and spices ) purchased for next to nothing at the local Harbor District markets. If not the taste, the smell of the shop was likely to scare most customers from actually purchasing anything but alcohol at Skully's Bar and Bait.</p>
