<h3>Adventures in the Gate</h3>
<p>Later on in life, Shandie and her partner Krydle came across two people fleeing from the Watch , the elven sorceress Delina and what appeared to be Minsc , the living embodiment of the Beloved Ranger statue. The pair of good-hearted thieves agreed to help them flee the city, as Shandie had a soft spot for elves. They made a deal with the Fetcher , agreeing to deliver a message to Krydle's father Coran in exchange for safe passage from Baldur's Gate.</p>
<p>Shandie, Krydle and the two adventurers manage to gain passage into a revel hosted by a Baldurian patriar family , but soon ran afoul of members of the restored cult of the Dragon . A fight broke out at the grand party, followed by a rooftop chase atop the buildings of the upper city. While Shandie demonstrated her expert skill as an archer, the cultists managed to abduct Delina and return them to their leader, her twin brother Deniak .</p>
<p>Continuing the fight on the side of goodness, the remaining trio tracked down the cultists' hidden lair and broke in just as Deniak was completing a ritual that used Delina's power to transform himself into a red dragon . Reunited, the four heroes worked together to down the giant wyrm before it wreaked too much destruction in the city. After fighting for the good of others, Shandie, Krydle, Minsc, Boo and Delina decided to continue working together as adventurers.</p>
<h3>Domain of Dread</h3>
<p>When taking on a job to protect the local temple of Kelemvor in the city, Shandie and her companions were tested again by a werewolf attack. Despite their best efforts, the lycanthropic wolves managed to abduct the Kelemvorite cleric Nerys along with numerous relics safeguarded at the temple. Just as they had before, the heroes managed to track down and help free the missing priest. However this time a cloud of otherworldly mist surrounded them and their foes alike, transporting them to the dark realm of Barovia in the Shadowfell .</p>
<p>The group traveled the strange land for some time, coming across a camp of vistani caravanners, and eventually a young vintner whose carriage was assaulted by a pack of vicious ghouls . Shandie and her companions saved the young man, Adrian Martikov , who then proceeded to offer them shelter at the Wizard of Wines vineyards. Following Minsc's shift, Shandie took watch as her fellows got some much-needed rest, but was forced to prevent her friends from killing one another when their dreams were haunted by memories of their past.</p>
<p>After arriving at the fortified town of Vallaki , the heroes reunited with the werewolves that first brought them to Barovia. They fought off the pack along with their vampiric master Sangin , but were confronted by none other than Baron Strahd von Zarovich . Following Nerys' charge, they attacked Strahd but could not penetrate his defenses. While Shandie was able to nullify some of the vampire lord's illusions, they were little match for his immense power. When it appeared they were truly defeated, the curse of Strahd's past manifested and Delina used her arcane power to transport the group back to safety on Toril .</p>
<h3>Return to Faerûn</h3>
<p>The adventurers found themselves in the frigid north of the Realms, in the Spine of the World mountains. Although the group quickly found shelter from the elements in a cave, Krydle took on a despairing attitude and Shandie had to remind him he was better than that behavior. After fighting off some ogres and meeting a new ally named Saarvin , they made their way to Fireshear and got some good rest for the first time in days. When a band of frost giants led by Gryttmort attacked the isolated settlement, the heroes came to its defense, and even managed to capture a member of the giant war-band.</p>
<p>Shandie and her group learned of Gryttmort's plan to steal an orb of dragonkind from the white dragon Nilanthe at Cold Crag Peak , and set out to stop the evil giants. While they were able to briefly ally themselves with Nilanthe by agreeing to recover her eggs from the frost giant's lair, they could not stop Gryttmort from seizing the orb and taking control of the white dragon's mind. With the help of Saarvin, Dasharra Keldabar and local leaders of Fireshear, The heroes managed to infiltrate the frost giant's glacial lair, and draw out the giants into a fierce battle. Shandie scored a precise shot with her bow on Gryttmort's hand, causing him to drop the orb of dragonkind , freeing the white dragons from his control and turning the tide of the battle in their favor.</p>
<p>True to their word, Shandie and her companions saved Nilanthe's eggs, return to her the orb of dragonkind , and returned to Fireshear as heroes. They celebrated their victory with the townspeople, before returning to Baldur's Gate.</p>
<p>Back in Baldur's Gate, Shandie accompanied Krydle as he uncovered the activities of his old gang, the Blades of Burgust . Together they helped foil an assassination attempt of Krydle's father Coran , a member of the Parliament of Peers , when the Blades broke into a secret meeting at High Hall .</p>
<p>After reuniting with their friends at a tavern, Shandie and the others discovered that Nerys had been infected with lycanthropy during their time in Barovia. Working with Father Alby of Kelemvor's church, the group helped restrain Nerys in here werewolf form during the ritual that would purge her of the curse. They were successful and Nerys was restored to her true self.</p>
<h3>Descent Into Hell</h3>
<p>When Shandie and her companions reunited, they learned that Minsc and Delina had come across a beleaguered member of the Hellriders named Aubree Lucent . They helped her investigate an infernal puzzle box at Fremin Greer 's shop, before making the journey south to Candlekeep . While uncovering the secrets of the box with the help of Sylvira Savikas , one of Delina's wild surges caused the group to be transported to Elutrel just as the city was being pulled down to the plane of Avernus .</p>
<p>While in the streets of Elturel, the group quickly became separated from one another. Shandie and Krydle ran from a pursuing spinagon , before being lured by a band of chain devils . Shandie was strung up by chains in an abandoned building, and Krydle was left alone to bargain his soul for her well being. Krydle offered his soul to the erinyes Oreasha , and carried Shandie to safety and set out to find their friends. They fought through some some more devils, before facing off against the Archduke of Avernus herself, Zariel . Shandie and her companions survived long enough to accompany Elturel to its return to Faerûn, while she was none the wiser about the infernal pact Krydle made to ensure her safety as well as that of their friends.</p>
