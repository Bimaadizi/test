<p>The Duskwood was a forest in the Border Kingdoms . It covered the eastern side of the Border Kingdoms area, between the Realm of the Smoking Star and the Realm of the Ready Sword .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Of all forests in the Border Kingdoms, the Duskwood was the deepest and most untamed. It had dense undergrowth.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Giant spiders , huge snakes , owlbears , and badger mice were all found in the Duskwood. Beholders were also said to lurk there.</p>
<p>Duskwood was home to several species of unique plants and animals. Ash wheat 's lifecycle affected the cycles of other animal species in the region. Ash wheat grew in abundance every spring, providing a generous food source for the badger mice and swelling their numbers. The growing population of badger mice led to abundant food for puff adders , increasing the snake population. In harsh winters, puff adders numbers dwindled only to increase after the annual ash wheat growth.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By 1479 DR , the Duskwood no longer existed, having been swallowed by the desert wasteland of the Shaar Desolation created through climate change brought about by the Spellplague .</p>
