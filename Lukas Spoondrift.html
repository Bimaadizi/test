<p>Lukas Spoondrift was the owner of the Sheaf of Wheat inn in the town of Ghars in Cormyr in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Spoondrift was a thoroughly mean-spirited man: arrogant, impatient, and holding long and petty grudges. He beat his employees, one time vicious enough to scar the slop boy Jasper 's buttock. True to his name, Spoondrift ate heavily, spending a good deal of his profits on food for himself, while for the inn he cut corners and substituted cheaper meats, such as mutton in the lamb stew and using horse meat in place of beef or stag meat.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was large and fat, owing to his heavy eating.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He somehow had a wife.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Jasper, having been "hired" by Benelaius as his servant in Eleint of the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR , told Spoondrift he was leaving his slop boy job, he was enraged by the news and shouted at him until he left.</p>
<p>Over time, part of the Sheaf of Wheat's roof became damaged but Spoondrift left it too long to get it fixed and leaks caused the beams and joists below to rot. Finally, he hired the local roofer Rolf to repair it in around Ches of the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR . However, one midnight, heavy boxes of wood shingles left on the roof fell through the floors and rained shingles down on Spoondrift and his wife in their bed. While Spoondrift blamed Rolf, Rolf denied the rotten beams were his fault. Rolf's father, also a roofer, offered to share the cost of rebuilding, but Spoondrift refused. They took the matter to a magistrate in Wheloon , and argued about it through the rest of the year.</p>
<p>On the night of Flamerule 21 in the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , Spoondrift spotted the ghost of the bandit chieftain Fastred .</p>
<p>In summer of that year, Spoondrift allowed the local merchant Barthelm Meadowbrock to use the Sheaf of Wheat to lodge attendees of the annual meeting of the Merchants' Guild . On Eleint 18 , in preparation, Butcher Skedmoor delivered beef, lamb, poultry, and fish to the inn, but Spoondrift held up the delivery by inspecting cuts of meat. Afterward, Jasper tried to interview Spoondrift about his sighting of the ghost, which had since been discovered to be Dovo in disguise when he was found murdered. But, even a full year later, Spoondrift maintained his contempt for Jasper, even still calling him "slop boy" and only blamed the killing on Rolf. The next day , Spoondrift took it upon himself to admit properly credentialed attendees of the Merchants' Guild's grand reception held at the Sheaf of Wheat, and thus was forced to graciously welcome their special guest Jasper with a bow and polite words. It was an effort.</p>
