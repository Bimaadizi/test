<p>The Great Wheel cosmology was the prevalent cosmological model in which the world of Toril was said to exist during the mid-14 th century DR and the post- Second Sundering era.</p>
<p>The Great Wheel was described as a complex, comparatively cosmopolitan place in which the gods of many worlds and pantheons mingled, the beliefs of many faiths and peoples bleeding together in a set of Outer Planes shaped predominantly by the polar forces of Law, Chaos, Good, and Evil. Thus it was that Lliira and the Greek goddess Hecate could feud over the love of the Sumerian god Enki and work at a pleasure palace operated by the Aztec gods Xochipilli and Tlazoteotl. In fact, a number of alliances existed between the gods of Toril and those of other worlds, for example, between Mystra and Wee Jas of Oerth , as well as a plot by a god of Toril ending up involving the gods of Krynn .</p>
<p>The actual term "Great Wheel" did not mean the cosmology as a whole until the development of the World Tree cosmology in 1372 DR . By the Time of Troubles , the terms "Great Wheel" or "Great Ring" meant the Outer Planes only. During this time, the cosmology as a whole did not require a name other than "the Planes" or "the Multiverse," as there were no formally named alternatives yet.</p>
<p>By the late years of the 15 th century DR , some sages began to use again the Great Wheel cosmology model, while other sages preferred to use the World Tree or the World Axis models. Of the three, the Great Wheel model remained the most commonly used; however, it was modified to include the planes discovered after the Spellplague .</p>
<h2>Basic Structure</h2>
<p>The Great Wheel cosmology consisted of a series of somewhat concentric spheres. In the center was the Prime Material plane containing the phlogiston with the crystal spheres and worlds within, surrounded by an Ethereal plane (misty realms of proto-matter). Outside of the Prime and Ethereal were the Inner planes , also called the Elemental planes , which had their own structure based on a sphere. Then came the Astral plane which connected the worlds in the Prime Material plane to each other (bypassing the phlogiston) and also to the last sphere, the Outer planes . The Prime Material plane touched both the Astral plane and its Ethereal plane, though these planes did not touch one another. The Outer planes, also called the Planes of Power, were 16 planes arranged in a circle (the Great Wheel) defined mainly by alignment and surrounding a 17th neutral plane known as the Outlands .</p>
<p>The Inner planes were the six major elemental planes (Fire, Earth, Water, Air, Positive Energy, Negative Energy), the four para-elemental planes (Smoke, Ice, Ooze, Magma), and the eight quasi-elemental planes (Lightning, Steam, Radiance, Minerals, Vacuum, Salt, Ash, Dust). They could be thought of as being on the surface of a sphere with Positive Energy at the north pole, Negative Energy at the south pole and Fire, Earth, Water, and Air on the equator, equidistant from each other. The para-elemental planes were found on the equator between the boundaries of Fire, Earth, Water, and Air (Magma was between Fire and Earth, for example). Four of the quasi-elemental planes were found between the boundaries of Positive Energy and the four elements (Steam was between Positive Energy and Water, for example). And the other four quasi-elemental planes were between Negative Energy and the four elements (Vacuum was between Negative Energy and Air, for example). The Inner planes were surrounded by the Ethereal planes , which connected them to the Prime Material planes.</p>
<p>Demiplanes were planes of finite extent found within an Ethereal plane. They may have been the creations of extremely powerful wizards , technologists , or demigods or they may have been created when a large glob of proto-matter began to pull away from its Ethereal plane and achieved separation. Demiplanes might eventually collapse in on themselves, re-merge with its parent Ethereal, or merge with an Inner plane or Prime Material plane. Each demiplane had its own rules regarding gravity, vision, magic, and material make-up.</p>
<h2>Transitive Planes</h2>
<h3>Ethereal Planes</h3>
<p>In the Great Wheel model, each Prime Material plane had its own Ethereal plane in which nothing was solid, including living creatures, their possessions, weapons, and armor. All metal became ethereal metal, flesh became ethereal flesh, stone ethereal stone, etc . The Ethereal touched its Prime at all points and bound it to the Inner planes, but the connections were not abrupt transitions like to/from the Astral plane but rather a gradual process in what was called the Border Ethereal. If you consider the Ethereal to be an ocean, a person in the Border Ethereal would be standing in the surf near the shore, invisible to those on land but able to see them and their surroundings dimly. One could travel along the shore, staying in the surf, and step back on land at some other point or move away from the shore toward the Deep Ethereal. A curtain of vaporous color marked the transition between the Border Ethereal and the Deep Ethereal, and each plane had its own color. After traversing the Deep Ethereal and reaching the curtain of the correct color, you would pass through to the Border Ethereal of your destination plane.</p>
<p>By use of magic (or the natural ability that some creatures were thought to have, like phase spiders ) one could fade into the Ethereal and travel at will. Gravity gave a sense of up and down, but movement in any direction was equally easy and objects released hovered in place. The proto-matter swirling about the Ethereal plane could be used to create demi-planes , either through natural fluctuations in the medium or by the actions of powerful beings. The known Demi-planes at the time were the Demi-Plane of Shadow , the Demi-Plane of Time , the Demi-Plane of Electro-Magnetism and the possibly legendary Demi-Plane of Imprisonment .</p>
<h3>Astral Plane</h3>
<p>The Astral plane was described as infinite nothingness interrupted only by small islands of material that broke off from their native planes and occasional spinning columns of astral conduits (called wormholes or gates and resembling water spouts from a storm at sea). The Astral plane connected the various Prime Material Planes with each other and to the first layers of all the Outer planes. Travel in the Astral was usually accomplished by spell, psionics , device, or color pool and involved leaving your physical body behind while your astral self traveled to your destination. During this transit, a nearly unbreakable silver cord connected your astral self back to your physical body. When you arrived at another plane, a new physical body manifested out of local materials. Wormholes linked specific places in the Outer planes to each other and to fixed locations in the Primes—quicker but likely more dangerous because your physical body was transported directly to a terminus that might be inhospitable or guarded.</p>
<h2>Outer Planes</h2>
<p>The Outer planes were organized according to alignment, which is most easily visualized as a wheel with spokes radiating from the center of true neutrality. In the diagram below, planes associated with Good (sometimes called the Upper planes ) are found above the line running from Nirvana to Limbo, and Evil-associated planes (sometimes called the Lower planes ) are below. Planes associated with Law are found to the left of the line running from Elysium to Hades, and Chaos-associated planes to the right. Many of the Outer planes were divided into layers—infinite sub-regions that metaphysically overlapped the other layers of the same plane.</p>
<h2>Inner Planes</h2>
<p>The four elemental planes—one each for Air , Fire , Earth , and Water —plus the two energy planes—one for positive energy and one for negative energy —made up the six major Inner planes. Between each pair of adjacent elemental planes was a para-elemental plane. The eight quasi-elemental planes were found between the four elemental planes and the two energy planes. The four para- and eight quasi-elemental planes added up to twelve minor planes for a total of eighteen Inner planes. Each plane was made up of primarily one type of matter, but pieces of other Inner planes may have found their way in (or been brought in by powerful forces). One thing all Inner planes had in common was that they were all hostile to lifeforms from outside, particularly from the Prime Material Planes .</p>

<h2>Revision</h2>
<p>When sages of the late 15 th century began to use the Great Wheel model again, they revised it to include the new planes discovered after the Spellplague and normally associated with the World Axis model.</p>
<p>The Elemental Chaos was considered to be the farthest extent of the inner planes, a hostile and unknown plane where all the elemental planes were combined. Some speculated it was home to strange elemental creatures.</p>
<p>The Feywild and the Shadowfell were considered to be parallel planes to the Prime Material, extreme echoes of the worlds of the Prime much like in the World Axis model. Those planes replaced the Plane of Faerie and the Plane of Shadow of the earlier version of the Great Wheel model.</p>
