<p>Myrcrest was a magical bird and servant of Vangerdahast , the Royal Magician of Cormyr , in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Although resembling a raven , Myrcrest was much larger, being about 50% wider and longer in the wings than a regular specimen. Its feet were pale and fleshy and ended in 3‑inch-long (7.6‑centimeter) talons, and its eyes glowed or reflected greenish-yellow light. Stranger still, its feathers had no sheen, instead seeming dull and even absorbing light. It could be quite intimidating to those unused to it.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Myrcrest was intelligent, but could only communicate via raven-like squawking and head bobs.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Myrcrest delivered messages for Vangerdahast. These it carried in a thick leather pouch tied around its neck.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On the evening of Eleint 18 in the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , Myrcrest carried a vital message from Vangerdahast concerning the fate of the killer of the king's envoy Grodoveth to retired War Wizard Benelaius at his cottage . He and Lindavar received it well, but Jasper was frightened of it.</p>
