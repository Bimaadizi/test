<p>Ixbillailzakzillimiliax was an ancient and legendary white dragon , whose nickname, Icewind , was the namesake of Icewind Dale , where she dwelt with her mate, Icingdeath , in and before the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ixbillailzakzillimiliax was a plague to the very first settlers of Icewind Dale. This gargantuan white dragon was a fierce foe whose age, power, and icy breath lent the northern region its name, according to some sages. She attacked with abandon, turning her prey and enemies into ice.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR , right after a bitter war between the Ten-Towns and Akar Kessell 's forces concluded with the mage 's defeat, Ixbillailzakzillimiliax awoke from her ice-encased slumber as several other threats descended on Icewind Dale, seeking the now master-less powerful artifact called Crenshinibon . It was speculated that the sentient evil artifact reached out to her, rousing the ancient dragon from her sleep of ages. The dragon awoke to the tundra being filled with tiny humanoids and her mat, slain by one of the heroes of Icewind Dale, Wulfgar . Ixbillailzakzillimiliax was fueled by vengeance and desire for the Crystal Shard. Subsequently, she faced the Companions of the Hall : Wulfgar, Drizzt Do'Urden , Bruenor Battlehammer , Catti-brie , and tiefling warlock Auralla . Her rampage was ended after a bitter battle in Icingdeath's tomb, and, presumably, ended in the dragon's demise.</p>
