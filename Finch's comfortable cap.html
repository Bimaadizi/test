<p>Finch's comfortable cap was just one of many enchanted hats worn by the daring half-elven bard Finch in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Despite the headwear being nowhere as well-ensorcelled as his previous hats, Finch still developed an attachment to this fanciful floppy-sided cap. It did possess a minor enchantment that slightly boosted the wearer's physical health and constitution and improved their evasion. The hat's custom enchantments made it impossible to be worn by anyone who was not a half-elven bard.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Finch wore his comfortable cap while performing in the city of Neverwinter and adventuring across the Sword Coast North .</p>
