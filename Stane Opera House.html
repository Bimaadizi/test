<p>The Stane Opera House was a prestigious theater in the city of Ravens Bluff in the 14 th century DR , so named for its ownership by the Stane family. While only moderately profitable, it was frequently a haunt of the Ravenian nobility and affluent alike, and thus managed to keep its doors open through the backing and bankrolling of several noble families.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This building stood along much of Lamorgyr's Ride , in the Tentowers neighborhood of the Uptown District . Facing away from the building, the district-spanning street Fireleap Way ran by it.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Opera House was a modest, three stories tall structure, made of black marble in emulation of Ravengard House , and had a large dome on its roof. At some point an exterior box office was added to the structure.</p>
<p>The black marble used in its construction was sourced from Stonethrust Quarrying , whilst the architecture of the building was designed by Mulsunder .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The small foyer of the theater acted as both its lobby and a ticket sales space. Arrayed along its eastern wall were several portraits of Opera house actors, with a small ticket desk sat before them. The northern wall of the room held double doors, framed on either side by red velvet curtains, that lead into the auditorium.</p>
<p>The main seating area of the theater was its auditorium, which had velvet curtains strewn across it walls. The auditorium seating for about a hundred people, elevated into three levels, all chairs firmly secured to the ground. Seating was divided by two pathways, that lead toward the stage, into three sections. On the left and right side of the auditorium were spiral staircases, leading up to the four balconies booths that stretched across either side of the theater, separated by a waist-high wall.</p>
<p>Each booth held seating for four, what were pairs of plush chairs, two in the front and two in the back. One balcony in particular, designated "1B", had a hidden secret door set in one of its walls. This secret passageway was a long flight of stairs, leading down into the theater's wardrobe area. For a time, due to threats posed by an entity called The Phantom, the booth was roped off and had a sign reading "CLOSED" in the Common tongue hung over its entryway.</p>
<p>The auditorium's roof was host to a pulley system of cables and ropes , most of which lead to a massive chandelier that hung overhead of the audience. The lighting system had its own dedicated room of levers, with one large lever controlling a rather large central rope of the chandelier. Above the lever was a big sign that read "do not touch" in Common.</p>
<p>The original chandelier, worth around 750 gp , held hundreds of candles and had nearly a thousand crystals dangling from its frame, In 1368 DR , it was cut from its bindings by an enigmatic figure called The Phantom and sent plummeting to the ground. A few months later, it had been replaced with a magical chandelier. The theater had a number of other quite large and magnificent chandeliers as well, no two of which matched and were likely sourced from Sembia . They were said to tinkle and chime whenever the Opera House's singers really got into the swing of things. When performances went on, the lights in the auditorium would be dimmed, whilst those centered on the stage would be brightened.</p>
<p>There was a 30 feet (9.1 meters) gap between the audience and the stage. A large restraining wall would later be constructed to further separate the stage from the audience. Situated 10 feet (3 meters) below the house floor was its orchestra pit, filled with music stands and chairs for the musicians to sit upon. East of the pit was a gentle rising slope and north of it stood a door directly leading under the stage. This crawlspace was empty, save for a ladder leading up to a trapdoor in the center of the stage. From this side, the trapdoor could be bolted shut.</p>
<p>The stage proper rose 5 feet (1.5 meters) above the theater floor and took up about a third of the Opera house's space. Overhead of the stage was an archway, which served to frame it for the audience. East of the stages were several doors to parts of the backstage and the manager's office, whilst mounted on the west wall were a set of bars and ropes with four corresponding levers. Acting as stop brakes, these levers were part of a large pulley system, allowing stagehands to raise and lower scenery set pieces that were hung up high from metal bars.</p>
<p>Backstage were two general, gender segregated dressing rooms, one for men and one for women. Both rooms were moderately sized spaces with dressing tables and racks of costumes. They each had a mirror that dominated their northern wall and a window in their eastern wall that looked out over the side street. The window in the women's dressing room had a comparatively poor view of the street. Additionally, there was a singular, smaller dressing room for the Opera House's starlet. It was furnished with a costume rack, a single chair, and a mirrored dressing table that dominated much of the small space. Following the tragic death of a starlet in 1368 DR, the room was barred from further use.</p>
<p>By far the largest room in the backstage side of the Opera House was its rehearsal room. It was sparsely furnished, save for a few chairs, music stands, and a piano . The eastern wall was covered in mirrors , along which ran a long wooden bar. The room was also host to the theater's back door and a hidden door behind one of the mirror panels, revealing a small, closet-like space.</p>
<p>The next largest room was the storage space for props, with little oddities scattered about haphazardly. Against one wall stood an armory of prop weapons and armor, with a sign above the weapon rack that read "do not touch" in Common. In addition to painted wood prop spears and swords , there were retractable daggers with hidden compartments for packets of theatrical blood , rapiers with soft tips, a real +1 shield , and a paper mache suit of plate armor . Unbeknownst to the manager, this suit of armor was actually a magic item and could impart real protection to a wearer.</p>
<p>Then there was the wardrobe room, the deceptively large workspace of the Opera House's tailors. The room seemed smaller than it actually was on account of the countless racks of costuming, mannequins , and boxes of fabric. There was a mirror mounted to one of its walls. And hidden within one of its corners was trapdoor, whose ladder lead down into the sewers of Ravens Bluff .</p>
<p>And finally, there was a small storage space for cleaning supplies and very odds and ends. With such things as boxes, brooms , mops , and shelves with theater-centric supplies like hairbrushes and makeup .</p>
<p>The office of the theater manager was lavishly furnished. In addition to a solid oaken desk and matching chair, situated beneath a portrait of one of the theater's early managers, it had a couch and three additional chairs for guests. The desk contained a strongbox of theater earnings, an account ledger, as well as various standard desk supplies like ink , parchment , and quills . Behind the portrait was a hidden storage compartment, a shelf recessed into the wall.</p>
<p>There was also a library in the Opera House, whose shelves were filled to bursting with books that primarily contained plays an operas. By some accounts, most of these theater pieces were mediocre. The room overall was lightly used, as evident by a thin layer of dust that could be found on most things therein.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Stane Opera House put on a number of abstract musical performances and seasonal operas for the more refined upper pallets of the Ravenian elite. Many of its operatic forms were notably quite experimental. In times when interest in the theater waned, the Opera House was open to being rented out and it allowed a local bardic group called The Burning Truth to perform on its stage.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Stane Family Opera House was owned and operated by the Stane family, initially by one Devnar Stane . Following his death, ownership of the theater fell to his brother Archibald Stane . Even after assuming control, Archibald would keep his brother Devnar's portrait hung on the southern wall of his office.</p>
<p>The theater employed a wide number of musicians, actors, and dancers who were all quite adept at their craft. Though some would argue that a few of their performances were less than stellar. Additionally, a number of tailors worked at the theater, fitting people for their costumes, numbering at least four in total.</p>
<p>For a time in the mid-14 th century DR, the theater's main starlet and soprano was a woman by the name of Crystal Dawning , who worked under the tutelage of Madame Dillon . After Crystal died in a freak accident, her understudy Mary Cyndcardys would take over from her.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the Year of the Wyvern, 1363 DR , a young newcomer to the stage by the name of Weston La Croix performed at the Opera house. Things went horribly awry for the actor on that fateful night, being laughed off the stage, and in his anguished flight from the stage stumbled into a host of lanterns that had been carelessly left out. The tormented Weston caught fire and in a panic ran through the theater. He would survive the incident, but with terrible burns on the left side of his face.</p>
<p>Weston devolved into a recluse, living within the city sewers and the secret passages of the Theater, hell bent on making sure no one else would get to act there again. Over time Weston would cause a number of "strange occurrences" within the theater. That were all brushed off as flukes, but that all changed on the day he murdered theater manager Devnar Stane, leaving him to be found in his office decapitated. With that incident it became cemented among the Opera House's staff that the theater was being "haunted" by an entity that they dubbed "The Phantom".</p>
<p>Weston's strange happenings died down following Devnar's death, as did operation of the theater in general, and word of The Phantom would not spread beyond its walls. When the Stane Opera House reopened its doors in the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , The Phantom began to strike anew. Weston issued multiple written warnings to the theater, advising against its renewal, eventually resorting to murdering a member of the orchestra. He stabbed the man through his heart with his own violin bow, then strung him up from the ceiling.</p>
<p>This show of force brought Archibald to close the Opera House once more and a massive search for The Phantom was conducted, through it bore no fruit. The new staff gossiped furiously, speculating that The Phantom was some kind of demon or devil that had laid a curse on the Opera House. Concerned for both his own reputation and that of the theater's, Archibald made all members of staff swear a vow of silence on the matter. The Phantom would go on to make demands that balcony seat 1B be permanently closed off and, not wishing for any further bloodshed, Archibald complied.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , the theater was underway in its first seasonal opera production, a performance of The Masquerade . However, as the night of the opera inched closer, soprano Crystal Dawning began to take ill. She had caught sight of The Phantom within the rehearsal room one night and tailed him to his hidden lair within the sewers. Enamored by her appearance, he cast some type of charm spell upon her. Archibald tried to explain away her odd behavior to the chorus as being mere fatigue, but the starlet became increasingly obsessed with that enigmatic figure. Before long gossip clamored through Opera House, saying that her state was The Phantom's work, and that he was sure to whisk Crystal away.</p>
<p>With Crystal now under his sway, The Phantom concocted a plan of robbery, instructing Miss Dawning to steal all of the valuables from Archibald's office and to take them with her when he comes to retrieve her on the night of The Masquerade . Afterwards, the two of them would frighten the rest of the audience, making them flee from the Opera House. Eventually, two days away from opening night, The Phantom left a letter on Archibald's desk that read,</p>
<p>Feeling little other choice, Archibald had a job offer posted up outside the Drooling Dragon Inn , seeking adventurers to provide security for five gold pieces per day. Unbeknownst to him, The Phantom sent Crystal Dawning a bouquet of roses within a vase that day, accompanied by a note that read,</p>
<p>A group of around six adventurers, strapped for cash and in need of work, would end up visiting the Opera House to answer Archibald's job posting. When they came to his office, Archibald explained how tomorrow was to be the opening night for The Masquerade and he wanted Crystal Dawning kept safe. He scoffed at the danger posed by The Phantom, confident that the adventurers could handle him if he showed up.</p>
<p>However, Archibald was rather tight-lipped with them about the Phantom affair, not wanting to risk word getting out to the general Ravenian public and costing him business. It was only with some coaxing that the adventurers managed to get him to reveal yesterday's letter. He implored the heroes to resolve the matter quickly and quietly, though also desired being credited with whatever plan ultimately liberated the Opera House from the terror of The Phantom.</p>
<p>Hired on, the adventurers proceeded to snoop around the Opera house for a bit, questioning people and looking for clues. Just as they were about to investigate the room beneath the stage, they heard the hysterical screams of two chorus girls, crying out "Help! Help! It's the Phantom!" When they rushed to see what was wrong, they found a hanged dummy with a note attached to it that read, "Here swings Archibald." Archibald then arrived, alongside Crawl and Madame Dillon. The manager excused them to his office, but on the way Crystal slipped the adventurers a note that read, "Meet me in balcony 2A in one hour". Back at his office, a sobbing Archibald told them the story of the murdered violinist and confided in them that he was afraid for his own life as well.</p>
<p>Archibald then filled the six adventurers in on his plan. Two of them were to perform in The Masquerade , under the minor roles of servants of Crystal Dawning, acting as her bodyguards. The other four were to wait in the wings as backup, free to do as they pleased so long as it did not disturb the dress performance. When they showed some reluctance, Archibald offered a 5 gp pay raise as well as a gemstone or two.</p>
<p>Over a bell later, fully fit in colorful and dainty costumes for their performance, the adventurers met up with Crystal Dawning. She warned them to look out for themselves, even advising them to leave and forget about what they've learned, for "the Phantom knows and sees all that happens here." During this confrontation, Madame Dillon pulled one of the adventurers aside and confided in them of Crystal's strange behaviors of late and the story of Weston La Croix. Before further questioning could be had of either, the dress rehearsal was called.</p>
<p>The rehearsal largely went smoothly, with the two costumed adventurers only standing on stage for a period of ten minutes. Just as they were making their way off stage, The Phantom struck a day ahead of schedule. Under the effects of the spells fly and invisibility, 10' radius , he landed atop the chandelier and cut its ropes, creating hysteria and panic among the theater staff. Amidst this opportune confusion, Crystal Dawning fled to Archibald's office to enact their robbery. As the chandelier was halfway to the ground, The Phantom hopped off it and flew towards Crystal, ready to cast color spray on any adventurers there waiting to stop them. The two then made their escape together down the stage's trapdoor.</p>
<p>Unwilling to let The Phantom get away with his heist, the six adventurers chased after them down through the city sewers, coming across two dead ends, several monsters, and the corpse of the violinist. All the while, taunted from afar by the mad bard. Eventually they found themselves at The Phantom's haven. Behind an oaken door they could hear the man's voice, yelling at Crystal to leave and then begging her cease something before letting out a blood curdling scream.</p>
<p>Entering, they took in the gruesome sight of a sobbing Crystal Dawning, clutching a bloody dagger with a limp hand. She was poised over the body of a dark cloaked figure, pooling in blood. They would soon discover this to all be an elaborate ruse of props taken from the theater – theater blood, a mere prop dagger, and the body no more than a mannequin . Meanwhile, the true Phantom was flying overhead, keeping quiet until he was ready to make a grand entrance.</p>
<p>Crystal shouted at the adventurers to stay back, threatening to end her own life if they came closer. She theatrically cried, "I had to
kill him...he was too ill-fated for this cruel, cruel world. Go away, and allow me to suffer my grief alone!" The moment the adventurers let their guard down, Crystal leapt back and The Phantom sprung to action, shouting "Ever surprised, are fools!" and firing off a magic missile . He fought the adventurers to the very death, all the while Crystal interfering on occasion on The Phantom's behalf. As he laid dying, Weston La Croix refused to reveal where he hid Archibald's valuables and delusionally proclaimed that he would rise from the dead one day to exact his revenge.</p>
<p>With Weston's death, Crystal Dawning was at last freed from the clutches of his charm spell. She told the adventurers everything she knew, emphasizing how she was coerced, and then revealed a shocking letter. Addressed to The Phantom, it said the author was going to commit to delivering Crystal to the specter. Whether the adventurers realized it or not, the handwriting was that of Archibald's, the man more than willing to give up the soprano in order to save his own theater.</p>
<p>Several months later, in the month of Eleasias , Crystal Dawning was found dead in the bath . Her death was ruled to be an accident, caused by acid that had fallen from a shelf above and into her bathing waters, but the next day a note was found over the tub. The next day, a group of adventurers working for the City Watch 's Investigative Unit to track down a serial killer, would visit the Stane Opera House to do some questioning and look around for clues. Searching the shelves above Crystal's bathtub, they discovered a leather scrollcase containing a note that read, "Tuesday's child is full of grace."</p>
<p>Sometime later in the 14 th century DR, the alchemist Silac Decor scaled the Opera House and from its rooftop tried to use an object called the orb of storms to destroy the De Villars Estate .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , whilst posing as Jaer Kell Wildhame , a minor noble from the Vilhon Reach , the rogue Jack Ravenwild received an invitation from Lord and Lady Flermeer to join them at their box in the Stane Opera House for a performance of The Bride of Secomber . He would end up attending later that evening, after having designed a mock coat of arms for the Wildhames.</p>
