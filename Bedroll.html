<p>A bedroll was a padded sack that allowed a person to sleep while traveling in the wilderness. It kept the occupant dry and warm.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A typical bedroll consisted of a sack that could contain a human -sized creature, with an opening on the side. Some variants consisted of several layers to provide waterproofing, warmth, and comfort.</p>
<p>Special heavy-duty bedrolls were available for purchase through Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue , which contained an outer layer of leather and an inner layer of Maztican cotton. Winter variants also had an additional layer of wool padding for extra warmth.</p>
