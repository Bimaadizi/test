<p>Auril's Truth was a set of enchanted priestly vestments worn by some Aurilian clergy.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These icy-white colored robes were imbued with magic that protected the wearer from cold. Additionally, Auril's Truth allowed the wearer to cast the cone of cold (expended two charges) and polar ray (consumed five charges) spells . A typical set of robes could hold up to thirty charges.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Auril's Truth was easily recognizable for its bright white color and blue trim. These robes were rarely seen in the hands of anyone but the clergy of the Frostmaiden. In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , a set of Auril's Truth could be purchased from Mintassan's Mysteries –a shop filled with exotic magical curios from across Toril .</p>
