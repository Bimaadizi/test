<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , as the Absolute crisis ravaged the Western Heartlands , the city of Baldur's Gate became flooded with refugees. Dholber Greene was lucky enough to secure lodgings for himself and Dwindling at Nortale's Hostel that offered beds to the refugees. Dwindling and her father lost family members, who did not make it to the Gate. At the hostel, the girl complained about lice and funny-smelling soap .</p>
