<p>The Shadow-cursed Lands was a region of the Western Heartlands that existed throughout the late 14 th and the 15 th centuries DR . It was described as being a place of "living death".</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Natural life in the Shadow-cursed Lands were twisted and corrupted by necrotic energy . Most trees within shriveled up and appeared as if dead, while others retained only a few brown and red leaves. Dessicated 'shadowroots' rose above the earth, forming a lattice of dead plant material that spread out like a network of veins. Patches of otherworldly, red grass appeared sporadically across the withered earth. Flora only appeared in its typical state in regions still-blessed by the goddess Selûne , or by other supernatural means.</p>
<p>The region was inundated with necrotic energy and was harmful to any living being that passed within. This 'umbral influx' rendered the flesh of living creatures, and replaced with eerie, blue-green energy. Any creature that succumbed to the curse and died, would rise again in short time as an undead iteration of its previous self.</p>
<p>The use of natural or magical light, such as that from a torch or spells , would negate the effect over a small radius. Receiving the blessing of the goddess Selûne , or using the unique moonlanterns , offered more potent protection from the shadow curse and the horrors it created.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The region surrounded Moonrise Towers , the landmark from which the shadow curse originated. It was situated just west of the Rosymorn Monastery trail , some ways east of Baldur's Gate .</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>Sentient plantlife in the region were twisted and warped by the shadow curse. Notable among these were shambling mounds , along with needle and vine blights . The region's shadowroots sprouted small, bulbous sacs that glowed an eerie green hue. These could be harvested and properly utilized by a skilled alchemist . Black oleander and night orchids were known to grow throughout the Shadow-cursed Lands.</p>
<p>The Shadow-cursed lands were plagued with hordes of undead, specifically ghouls , shadows , winged horrors , and zombie -like entities formed by those afflicted with the umbral influx.</p>
<p>Aside from undead, the self-hating creatures known as meazels were known to make their homes within the region.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century, the Shadow-cursed lands had been claimed―as much as they could be―by the cult of the Absolute . One of the cult's three leaders, General Ketheric Thorm the chosen of Myrkul , ruled over the lands from his seat of power at Moonrise Towers .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Few traders and merchants operated throughout the Shadow-cursed Lands. Those that did offer mercantile services operated out of the few locales that were protected from effects of the curse itself.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before it was transformed, circa the mid—14 th century, the region was known as a refuge for devoted followers of Selûne . The well-regarded Thorm family were devout Selûnites and ran the local House of Healing hospital. Once word of a Sharran enclave began to form in the region, Grand Duke Eltan dispatched a single Flaming Fist operative by the name of Art Cullagh to investigate.</p>
<p>It was either during or around the Year of the Wrathful Eye, 1391 DR , when the shadow curse was set upon the region. General Ketheric Thorm , a once-devout Selûnite general fell from grace and took over command of Shar 's Dark Justiciars in the region. The general wielded the army in his new goddess' name and was met on the battlefield by allied forces of Harpers and druids from the Emerald Grove . Thorm and Shar's Dark Justiciars were ultimately defeated.</p>
<p>Before he was imprisoned however, Ketheric Thorm unleashed the shadow curse upon the lands. Shadowy tendrils arose over the grand and across its sky, killing and twisting the natural life within and infusing it with the umbral energy associated with the Lady of Loss.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>It was believed that the only way to restore the Shadow-cursed Lands to their natural state was to restore the land's spirit whole once again. Unfortunately, a portion of the spirit was taken away into the Shadowfell . While true, that belief did not covey the entirety of the curse's remedy: to remove it entirely, the immortal Ketheric Thorm had to be killed.</p>
