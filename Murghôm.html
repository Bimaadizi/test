<p>Murghôm was an inland nation of farmers and horsemen in East Faerûn north of Brightstar Lake . Before the 15 th century DR , it was theoretically a subjugated territory of Mulhorand , having been a part of Mulhorand in the past. However, Murghôm was an independent nation, rival to Semphar . In the 15 th century DR, Murghôm became a nation ruled by dragons .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>With their position beside Taan , Murghôm was surrounded by Thay , the Great Wild Wood , Brightstar Lake, the Plains of Purple Dust and Mulhorand.</p>
<h3>Semphar</h3>
<p>The eastern half of the princedoms, Semphar was bordered by the eastern shores of Brightstar Lake in the west, Godswatch Mountains in the east, Shalhoond in the north and the Raurin Alta in the south. The nation was a land that cultivated magical study and one of the center points of trade between Kara Tur and Faerun , filling up the coffers from every mercantile exchange. In all other aspects, whatever else can be said about Semphar can also be said about Murghôm and vice versa. Murghôm attempted to annex Semphar several times throughout its history. In the end, the two nations became one land under the draconic banner after the Spellplague.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>Fearsome dire horses were known to roam its wilderness, inspiring fear, awe, folk tales, and even cultist veneration. Murghôm was also home to dragons , wyverns , perytons and a great deal of wild heard beasts which were hunted by the former. There have also been several sightings of named phoenixes throughout Murghôm's history that were immortalized in the folktales of the people.</p>
<p>Undead creatures and other monsters were a common sight in the grasslands, haunting and terrorizing the plains from the forest of Shalhoond to the infested northern coast of Gbor Nor where the largest numbers could be found.</p>
<p>Orcs and goblins dwelled in the abandoned shafts in the Mountains of Copper .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Murghôm's armies were composed of fast light cavalry units of horse archers and horse lancers. The mounted units would harass enemy forces by charging at full speed towards their targets and disengaging immediately upon delivering damage.</p>
<p>During the wars between Thay and Mulhorand, the pass of Thazar was used as an eastern approach to Thay. In the mid-14 th century DR , Thay sent occassional pirates into Murghôm. Privateers from Murghom were a constant threat to Dhaztanar around the same time.</p>
<p>Murghôm was too poorly administered to combat the bandits in the Mountains of Copper, and thus limited itself to patrolling the most traveled roads. Zindalankh was under the protection of the Bey of Murghôm , but the citizens paid little mind to his laws. Mercenaries in the service of king Tharmakkas IV viewed the soldiers stationed at Port Ghaast as pompous, unprofessional fools. They were neither very motivated nor highly trained.</p>
<p>Under the rule of the dragon princes of Murghôm, the nation issued permits for mercenary companies of 40 or fewer veterans. All were formed by former Murghômi commanders as the nation's armed forces were reduced by the dragon princes' decrees over the decades. Murghômi mercenary companies were forbidden from banding together while on the nation's lands or its immediate neighbors, like Thay. In the 15 th century DR, some of the noteworthy mercenary companies were Naelor's Banner , based out of Nimjammir , Shaele's Shields , based out of Vurlakh under the command of Shaele Flamehair , and Turvuld's Swords in Sessim .</p>
<p>Nearly all dragon princes commanded several formations of 30 light cavalry horse archers. They were equipped with light javelins (which they only threw and rarely used them for close quarters combat), were capable of moving fast with high degrees of mobility, while being dangerous both on the mount and on the ground. Additional equipment included: handaxe or shortsword , shields (often worn on the back) and daggers at belt and down boot. Gate-guardians and mansion doorguards were the only ones known to have ever used plate armor on a frequent basis.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>During the age of ancient Netheril , Murghôm was thought to have been ruled by the family of the then mortal Myrkul , known at the time as Myrkul Bey al-Kursi, the Crown Prince of Murghôm.</p>
<p>Before the 15 th century, the leaders of the Murghômi were called atamans . The state was a series of semi-autonomous communities that gathered into collective government only in times of war. Murghôm was nominally ruled by a king from the city of Murghyr whose law was enforced by the nation's army, but as of 1359 DR the king was a senile old man with little control over the country and the Murghôm army was composed mostly of shady mercenaries. The Mulhorandi precept of Ganath had his post located in Murghyr , and he doubled as the ambassador to Murghôm. It was considered cushy, a good place to get away from politics. In 1357 DR, the post was held by Imthalos .</p>
<p>Emirs were governors of a city or village. In at least one instance, the emir was served by sheriffs known as maliks who in turn commanded the civil watch. One emir in Semphar's Iliphanar had a far larger number of troops and his own spy network in order to protect the Silk Road while Murghôm's Tarman the Old was a demented man of old age who did little for the city and allowed the merchants to run amuck. From these examples one can conclude that the powers of the emir varied case by case.</p>
<p>The Bey of Murghôm had the power to appoint emirs to rule over a location the bey specifies. Furthermore, the bey can rule and enact laws in a city, offering protection in return. To attack a city that is under the Bey's protection is considered a declaration of war against Murghôm.</p>
<h3>After the Spellplague</h3>
<p>That changed in the 15 th century DR, when Murghôm was "conquered" by dragons. As of 1489 DR , the nation was ruled by the powerful dragon princes .</p>
<p>Each dragon was attended by human viziers and chamberlains who were ordered to limit the number of guardsmen in favor of surveillance webs which minimized the chances of humans preforming self-directed undertakings. Foreign adventurers were spied upon while items that piqued the dragon's interest were confiscated such as gold, gems, magic or any other item the dragon might adore. Adventuring companies could not seek out permanent residence and were given death sentences if they threatened to inflict harm on any dragon prince, but this draconian punishment was not given to those who threatened their human subjects and landless dragons.</p>
<p>For preserving the safety and security of their citizens, the dragons demanded monthly tribute.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A local peak in the Mountains of Copper, called The Kobold Crown , was thought to have held a kobold civilization once, annihilated by 1368 DR . The ancient city of Dharrmaghongh in Murghôm was leveled by a single rune of power in ancient times.</p>
<p>Mulhorand used to encompass Murghôm from its annexation in −1500 DR .</p>
<p>The Daggers of Dusk were known to have meddled in the affairs of Murghôm after the fall of the Shoon Dynasty , for a bit longer after 450 DR .</p>
<p>The Havi attacks on Murghôm after the independence of Semphar greatly contributed to diminishing the Mulhorandi control of the area. Though Murghôm was declared a vassal state once Mulhorand expanded again, their hold was tenuous, and Murghôm declared itself independent after Semphar did. It remained effectively a vassal state of Mulhorand , however.</p>
<p>Murghôm had a rivalry with Semphar, and had militarily disputed many territories between the rivers Ghaast and Haqar . There had been two wars in which Murghôm attempted to reclaim Semphar. It was semi-independent from Mulhorand, but would provide food or soldiers upon request. As of 1357 DR , it hadn't been requested in centuries. Most of the incarnations of Mulhorand saw Murghôm as a land with no ties to them whatsoever.</p>
<p>During the wars between Thay and Mulhorand, the pass of Thazar was used as an eastern approach to Thay. In 1280 DR , a Thayan invasion lead by Zulkirs ravaged Murghôm in the course of their advance on Mulhorand.</p>
<p>Per Elminster Aumar , the brothers Iraun and Srivven hailed from a mage academy in east Murghôm, which was destroyed in a conflict between students and mentors. The event must have happened well before the Year of the Arch, 1353 DR , when the brothers' stay at Adaerglast was known to the Mage Royal of Zindalankh .</p>
<p>A group of escapees from Mulhorand and Thay who hid in the Ganathwood around 1367 DR had been at least partly destroyed after attacking a Murghômi village in 1369 DR by the druids Berun and Chereth .</p>
<h2>Demographics</h2>
<p>Inhabitants were referred to as Murghômi. As of 1479 DR , the population was made up by dragons of many varieties and a large population of Mulani .</p>
<p>Draconic bloodline innate magic users and Aasimar were prevalent in the populace, the former was the logical result of high concentrations of dragons in the region while the latter were remnants of the bygone age of Mulhorand's occupation.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Along with the Mulhorandi people, the Murghômi spoke Mulhorandi and revered the Mulhorandi pantheon (as of 1372 DR ). Muhjuri was spoken in Murghôm, too. Their knowledge of common was second-rate, enough to understand and engage in conversations, with a few pantomimes here and there when needed.</p>
<p>Murghôm worshipped the Mulhorandi pantheon; Thoth was considered the protector of Murghôm. Though Thoth held the title of Protector of Murghôm, he had little interest in the land, as it held little interest in mages . By 1371 DR, the Mulhorandi pantheon's flock was dwindling in Murghôm, and there were only some temples in some isolated parts of the realm. It was widely hypothesized that at least one great temple of Silvanus existed in the Great Wild Wood of Murghôm. Curses and spells to safeguard tombs were favored in the area.</p>
<p>After the Second Sundering , Murghômi continued to worship the Mulhorandi pantheon. Although culturally they were still Mulan, they no longer considered themselves as such because the vast majority of the population saw the Murghômi identity as separate and independent from other Mulan subgroups.</p>
<p>Followers of Clavrellin The Red Lantern, one of the Seven Stars of Selûne , protected Murghôm and the Dragon Princes from the machinations Szass Tam and those who wished harm upon dragon kind.</p>
<p>The highly-valued horse breeds of Murghôm descended from Raurin horses; Semphari horses were bred in Murghôm, found mainly between that realm and Semphar. The Murghômi were known for their skill with horses . Their goads often had a whip on the back, and could be reversed for use as either.</p>
<p>Giant sturgeon were considered a delicacy in the courts of Murghôm, and the fish were paid for handsomely.</p>
<h2>Trade and Industry</h2>
<p>Murghôm exported grain , gems , fish , horses and fruits .</p>
<p>Its copper was traded with the nomads in Ejen Horo . Wood and fishery products from the Lake of Mists were often brought to Murghôm. Rugs from Murghôm were traded far and wide. The Rauthenflow river was central to trade in Murghôm, and several dredging barges were used to keep it navigable.</p>
<p>Murghômi traders who sought to trade with Rashemen had to go through Shevel . Travelers from Thay headed for Murghôm took the road south from Pyarados to Rauthil in the mid-late 14 th century DR . Traders trying to avoid the taxes of Murghôm would sometimes cut through the Spice Road .</p>
<p>There had been a printing industry for approximately three hundred years as of the mid-late 14 th century DR. The term for a tannery was "batar" as of 1372 DR . The same word was used in Semphar. Kukri were popular in Murghôm. A local industry made cheap boxes for import.</p>
<p>Elkammath tea was brewed from the fibrous roots of groundnuts found in Murghôm, its neighboring regions, and Chondath . Halva from Murghôm was made with hard honeycomb. Marka was made from a bush that grew in local foothills. Ring-shaped loaves were a known food, measuring at least 10 inches in width, with some far larger.</p>
<p>In the mid-14 th century DR , Murghôm had a small silk industry, though it was inferior to Shou production. There were also some traders in the late 14 th century DR who had attempted to raise korontaun , though the goats struggled in the climate.</p>
<p>Murghôm was considered as one the largest food producers in the world, exporting food to their rivals and the nations that border the Sea of Fallen Stars . This status remained after the Dragon Princes rose to prominence. The country offered services such as horse breeding, horse training and horse riding. Military grade horses were bread in limited numbers due to fear that they could be used against the nation by its enemies. Unlike the previously mentioned status of "Breadbasket of Faerun", the amount of horses that were exported had dwindled with the coming of the new draconic administration since excess horses were sacrificed to the wyrms in order to satiate their large and growing appetites.</p>
<p>The dwarven kingdom of Harheldur in the eastern region of Sunrise Mountains maintained commerce to its south with Murghôm, indicating no intention to trade with Thay.</p>
<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>Lord Yegar wanted to press a claim on the Mountains of Copper as of 1367 DR , though he had little luck getting the rest of Rashemen on board. That same year, Anton Tikizaras attempted to trick some adventurers, playing on their sympathy by claiming his brother had departed for Murghôm with a cartload of rugs he was supposed to deliver elsewhere.</p>
