<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Vilhelm was but one of many enthralled servants and guards who staffed the massive Szarr Palaceâ€”the home of vampire lord Cazador Szarr located in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate. When Cazador's ascension ritual began and kickstarted a massacre of the party guests behind a magically sealed door, Vilhelm was tasked with standing by the entrance, allowing invited guests in to their doom. Vilhelm knew of the ritual's purpose and expected all Cazador's "children" to be in the Tourmaline Depths as the part of the ritual. Vilhelm both feared and was loyal to his master.</p>
