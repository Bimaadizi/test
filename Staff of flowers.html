<p>A staff of flowers was a magical staff that caused flowers to grow.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When pointed at earth or soil, it caused a regular, non-magical flower to sprout. The wielder was able to choose which flower would grow, but if they didn't, the staff, by default, created a daisy . The staff held ten charges, and each time the staff was used to create a flower, a charge was expended. The staff recharged itself daily at dawn. When the last charge was used, there was a chance the staff would turn into a bunch of flower petals. A more forceful blow from the staff could also create a more deadly plant specimen. Other powers of the staff included creating a pleasant-smelling ring of flowers floating in the air that provided the wielder's allies with inspiration and empowerment, and enemies were poisoned when inhaling the flowers' aroma.</p>
<p>A staff of flowers was a part of a set that, when used together, boosted the magics of all items in the set: the staff, the Woven Vine , and the Blooming Cord .</p>
<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
