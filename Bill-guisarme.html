<p>The bill-guisarme , sometimes known simply as a bill , was a combination polearm derived from the agricultural tool known as a billhook . It was similar to another agricultural-based polearm, the guisarme .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The bill-guisarme consisted of a long pole, measuring around 7​ to ​8 feet (2.1​ to ​2.4 meters) in length. Over the years since its inception, the design of polearm's head went through many iterations. The most common of these consisted of three implements. The first was a sharp, jutting back spike, typically L-shaped and pointing forward. The second was a sturdy hook whose inner or "concave" edge was sharpened, as were sometimes its outer edge, to the point of being a cutting edge on the weapon. And the third was a heavy cutting blade, reminiscent of a meat cleaver .</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>Due to the variety of cutting and piercing implements on a bill-guisarme, there was a wide range of ways it could be utilized in combat.</p>
<p>Like most polearms, the bill-guisarme required lots of room in order to be used properly and two hands to wield.</p>
