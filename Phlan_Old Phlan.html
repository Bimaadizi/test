<p>Old Phlan , referred to the largest portion of Phlan that was occupied by monstrous creatures and lay in ruin throughout much of the city's history of destruction and rebuilding. It stood in stark contrast to Civilized Phlan , the last remnant of humanity within the city's walls throughout the middle of the 14 th century DR , before Phlan was rebuilt whole once again, proud amongst the Moonsea powers.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>For much of its history, the sealed chambers of Old Phlan often contained wondrous treasure and deadly monsters. When the city was still in ruin, builders often refused to work in these areas due to the risk to their safety. It was rebuilt throughout late 14 th and early decades of the 15 th century, until it became a part of what was known as the " Old City " and restored to its former glory. It was once again home to Phlan's temples, noble estates and thriving businesses.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Old Phlan comprised nearly all of Phlan at one point, including part of the city's slums and all of the city blocks north, all the way to Valjevo Castle , along with the entirety of Mansion District on the opposite side of the Stojanow River .</p>
<p>After reconstruction throughout the 15 th century, Old Phlan became incorporated into the broader Old City, alongside the area previously referred to as Civilized Phlan. The Old City was the portion of Phlan that remained fortified within its city walls, while East Phlan encompassed that sprawled out to the east across the Stojanow.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Thunder, 1306 DR , Phlan was assailed by the dragons of Thar in a conflict that came to be known as the Dragon Run . The city was left in ruin and many of its citizens were slain outright. Its ruined streets became overrun by goblins , kobolds , orcs , and other monstrous creatures. Within the next few decades the ruins of what came to be known as Old Phlan were claimed by Tyranthraxus the Possessing Spirit, inhabiting the body of a bronze dragon and claimed the pool of radiance beneath Valjevo Castle .</p>
<p>Over time, the Council of Ten and leading community members holed up in the area of the city near the docks known as Civilized Phlan, orchestrating the means by which they could reclaim their city. Adventurers , looters, thieves and other opportunistic individuals were attracted to the chaos of the city, some with ill intent, and others that sought to help make things better.</p>
<p>The city was given true hope for renewal when one intrepid band of heroes ventured into the ruins of Old Phlan. They proved themselves the saviors of Phlan by defeating Tyranthraxus and helping drive his minions outside the city's walls. Many of Phlan's dreadful and nefarious denizens had been ousted by the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , even though its infrastructure remained largely destroyed. Even then, the city as a whole possessed a renewed spirit and hope for better years to come.</p>
<p>Throughout the late 14 th and 15 th centuries, Old Phlan was gradually rebuilt to its former glory from some centuries past. By the time reconstruction was complete, the term "Old Phlan" fell into disuse and the designation of the "Old City" was used to describe the entirety of the walled section of the city. On occasion, there was some overlap with terminology, but by and large Old Phlan had merely become a part of the city's long and storied past.</p>
