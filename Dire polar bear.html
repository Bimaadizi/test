<p>Dire polar bears were massive and deadly predators, bigger, stronger, and naturally armored, unlike their smaller kin.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These ursines looked similar to their smaller cousins: regular polar bears . However, they were the size of a small house, with their backs armored with tough bony ridges. Their black claws were as sharp as swords . Even compared to dire bears , dire polar bears were the largest of the family, reaching 20 feet (6.1 meters) in length on average. An adult specimen weighed as much as 15,000 pounds (6,800 kilograms).</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Dire polar bears were aggressive beasts that hunted and stalked prey: travelers, adventurers , and explorers.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like their smaller kin, dire polar bears were fast swimmers and possessed a keen sense of smell that aided them during the hunt. Due to their white coats, they also remained undetected among white snow dunes.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Not intelligent enough for anything but a straight assault, a dire polar bear relied on its sharp claws in battle. It pummeled and rended its victims. If a dire polar bear got close to its prey, it attempted to hug them, crushing and ripping them apart with its maw.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Dire polar bears could be found in the coldest arctic regions, hunting in the snow-swept plains, either as solitary predators or in mated pairs. Dire polar bears occasionally descended into the Icewind Pass in Icewind Dale from their primary habitat in the Reghed Glacier . They were also known to be tamed by a bigger and more dangerous species found in the North: frost giants .</p>
<p>Outside of the Prime Material plane , fiendish dire polar bears inhabited the glaciers of Cania , the 8 th layer of Baator .</p>
