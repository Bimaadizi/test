<p>Stonefire axes were a variety of enchanted greataxes created on the Sword Coast North in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Stonefire axes' heads were forged out of stonefire and always remained hot. To protect the wielder from the axe's heat, the shaft was made out of an immensely long piece of ironwood .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>There existed three variants of stonefire great axes , with a +1 , +2 , and +8 enchantments what made the axe's blade deadlier and guided the wielder's hand towards the target. All three variants were hot enough to burn and set their targets aflame.</p>
<p>Stonefire axes could be created from an enchanted great axe and a slab of adamantite .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Stonefire axes were old weapons and their design's origin was lost to history. The stronger varieties of these axes bore no crafter's name but, indubitably, were works of a master craftsman.</p>
<p>Stonefire axes with a simpler +1 enchantment were forged by Master Blacksmith Marrok of Shining Knight Arms and Armor shop of Neverwinter to help the heroes who sought the cure from the dreaded Wailing Death of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Later the same year, more powerful versions were created by Master Blacksmith Barun of Beorunna's Well to help the forces of Neverwinter stand against Lady Aribeth the Betrayer , who led a marching army of Luskan in the deadly but short-lived Neverwinter-Luskan war.</p>
