<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the gods of the Realms took mortal form on Faerûn during the Time of Troubles in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , the eccentric old man that lived with Pretti fervently told everyone the cat was the embodiment of Oghma , the Lord of All Knowledge. While no one in town believed the old fool, Pretti's opinion on the matter was unknown.</p>
