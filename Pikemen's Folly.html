<p>Pikemen's Folly , sometimes misnamed as Pikeman's Folly , was a trade route that ran between the city-state of Hlondeth and the city of Ormath in the Shining Plains of the Vilhon Reach .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Pikemen's Folly was constructed in the Year of the Ironwood, 125 DR , boosting trade between the City of Serpents on the Vilhon Reach's northern shores and the Shining Plains. By the Year of the Lost Library, 150 DR , Pikemen's Folly became a major caravan route, making the city of Lheshayl the center of commerce in the Shining Plains and Ormath prospered on supplying steeds for the traveling merchants. These horses were in high demand and the famous Plainsteeds of the Shining Plains traveled and could be found in many places along the Pikemen's Folly, from Lheshayl to Riatavin in the west.</p>
