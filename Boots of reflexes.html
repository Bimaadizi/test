<p>Boots of reflexes were enchanted boots that originated from the nation of Amn and were designed to be worn by its notorious Shadow Thieves sometime before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Boots of reflexes , to no surprise, improved the wearer's reflexes, allowing them to dodge out of the harm's way in mere moments, or survive an onslaught of powerful magics. Boots of reflexes were created with different enchantment strengths, from light magic that slightly honed the wearer's reflexes, to a significantly more powerful version.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Boots of reflexes were created long before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR to counter the elaborate deadly traps placed in place by the rich and powerful of Amn, to safeguard their riches. These magic boots ended up quickening the reactions of the Shadow Thieves best assassins and burglars .</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, many of these boots ended up in the hands of merchants of magical goods and adventurers in Northwest Faerûn and as far from Amn as the city of Westgate on the Dragon Coast .</p>
