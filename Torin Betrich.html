<p>Torin Betrich was a peasant of Eveningstar , Cormyr , in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar in the mid-1480s DR , Torin's friend Ana Brabener was captured by the drow along with several other villagers of Eveningstar during their hunt for the Thread of the Weave and were held in the Eveningstar Cavern . As the captives were about to be dragged into the Underdark , adventurers from Eberron emerged into the cavern from the portal to the Underdark and slew Ana's drow captors, freeing her and the other villagers.</p>
<p>After Ana's rescue, Torin chose to search for the Thread of the Weave to find it before the drow did. Ana, along with their mutual friend Cormul Haythorne , had initially decreed it to be too dangerous. However, they later relented and joined Torin, seeking out an old Temple of Mystra deep in the King's Forest . However, the three were ambushed by the drow when they neared the temple. At that moment, Ana manifested an unknown power, resulting in an explosion that killed several of the drow and knocked out Cormul and Torin. Due to her strange display of magic, she was captured by Odezzt Avithoul and taken deep into the temple, where the taskmaster sought to discover how it was that she had cast that spell. After they recovered, Cormul returned to Eveningstar to find help while Torin remained in the woods to search for Ana.</p>
