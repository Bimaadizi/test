<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Their specialized combat training was highly valued among rural folk and residents of cities all across the Realms. They stalked and took down foes that may threaten innocent communities or thriving bastions of civilization.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Hunters were among the most versatile combatants. They tailored their fighting style according to the threats they may face, their preferred weapon of choice, and how best to avoid or mitigate attacks directed at them.</p>
<p>All hunters chose one of several distinct fighting styles, each of which were more efficient against a different type of foe.</p>
<p>Hunters that preferred to be in the thick of battle developed whirling maneuvers that allowed them to strike each enemy nearby. Those that preferred bows , crossbows , and other ranged weapons, learned how to fire massive volleys of projectiles in mere moments.</p>
<p>As they became more experienced, hunters developed numerous defensive techniques to remain out of harm's way. Some hunters taught themselves how to avoid opportunistic attacks made by foes, while others studied the attacks of a single foe in order to gain advantage. They became masters of evasion, dodging away from opponents' strikes to lessen any harm, and even redirecting their opponents' attacks against their own allies.</p>
