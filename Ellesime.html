<p>Ellesime was the elven queen of Suldanessellar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>She was said to be of divine heritage; indeed, her beauty was often compared to that of a goddess. Ellesime inhabited the palace of Suldanessellar, which was built around the Tree of Life â€”the queen's eternal youth was said to be preserved by the tree, and as such it was difficult to judge her age. She was once in a relationship with the mage Irenicus , who was subsequently exiled from Suldanessellar for attempting to raise himself to the status of godhood.</p>
<p>In 1368 DR , Ellesime was forced to flee Suldanessellar, after it was attacked by Joneleth, "The Exile" . She and the other survivors fled to Myth Rhynn .</p>
