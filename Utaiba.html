<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Zhentilar aggression against the Bedine in the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , Utaiba and his tribe became unable to leave their home at the Well of the Chasm oasis, due to the Zhent camp formed nearby. Fortunately, they received assistance from Sheikh Sa'ar and the Bait Mahwa. the two tribes were able to join forces and route the allied Zhents and their asabi mercenaries at the Battle of the Chasm .</p>
<p>Following the battles, Utaiba and Sa'ar brought together the sheikhs of thirteen other Bedine tribes to the sacred Elah'zad oasis to confer on what was to be done with the Zhentarim threat. They ultimately decided to fight as one united people, gathering all the Bedine within over a tenday 's ride away from the oasis.</p>
<p>After leading the Bedine victory against the asabi at the Battle of the Fissures , Utaiba and the Raz'hadi joined the other Bedine tribes in a final siege against the Zhent forces that were occupying the ruined city of Orofin . The Raz'hadi stayed in reserve, protecting the witch Ruha , until she could blow open a hole in the ruined keep's walls and the tribe's warriors could rush through and defeat the malevolent outlanders. The plan was successful, and Utaiba himself fought a contingent of soldiers alone until the Raz'hadi warriors were able to catch up with their fearsome sheikh.</p>
