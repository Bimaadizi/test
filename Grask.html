<p>Grask was a dusk beast and the companion of Sithierel on the Necreme in the early 1370s DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Grask liked to curl up and lie down in the bow of the Necreme , where its two heads could watch over the boat and those who approached it when docked, and then alert Sithierel.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Grask loyally served Sithierel as the shadar-kai plied the waters of Shadow Swamp ferrying captives between the Shadow Citadel and the Monastery of the Ebon Dome .</p>
<p>Eventually, in early Eleint of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , an adventuring party in service to Mystra likely encountered the pair and defeated Grask and Sithierel.</p>
