<p>The Iron Keep was a fortress located on Oman's Isle within the Moonshae Isles . It overlooked the city named in its honor , and was the ancestral seat of power for the Northlander rulers of Oman . It lay in ruins as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The keep was located atop a rocky hill above Iron Bay on the north side of Oman's Isle, and a winding stone stairway climbed the hill to the front gate. The fortress dominated the landscape above the surrounding settlement, and served as a visible symbol of the might of Oman's rulers.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The castle was massive, said to be nearly rival the Palace of the High King in size and to be a veritable bastion of stone. The core of the keep was a forbidding and centuries-old, square-shaped Ffolk castle of towering and thick granite walls pierced by a gaping gate. Wooden halls and buildings had been built atop the old castle, increasing its height and causing the fortress to sprawl down the hill on which it sat. The high ramparts afforded a commanding view of the beaches of Iron Bay. Earthen battlements covered in sharp wooden spikes surrounded the structure. As of the midâ€“14 th century DR , the newest addition was a tall stone tower rising from the heart of the castle, atop which fluttered the king's banner.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The fortress was well-lit by torchlight . Around the corner from the main gate was a vast courtyard from which the huge barracks and the high walls could be accessed via circuitous corridors. The great hall served as both throne room and banquet room. It was dominated by a large hearth, which was big enough to require four tree trunks of firewood , although the hall was so large that this hearth could not keep the whole space warm. For feasting, long oak tables and benches lined the room.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>It was known as the strongest fortress possessed by any Northlander kingdom.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The famous King Thelgaar Ironhand ruled from the Iron Keep during the mid 14 th century DR. By his order, Ffolk slaves had constructed the central tower for his fortress.</p>
<p>On Marpenoth 13 of the Year of the Saddle, 1345 DR , the god Bhaal sent an earthquake that partially destroyed the fortress.</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Oman's Isle was overrun and ruled by giants from the Grampalt Highlands and fomorians of Vor Thomil . Iron Keep was the last bastion of the Moonshavians to fall, which it did before Midsummer of that year.</p>
<p>Much of the fortress was ruined when the giants took control of Oman's Isle. As of the late 15 th century DR, servants of the giants occupied the keep and guarded the bay in order to prevent the stronghold from falling back into human hands. As of the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , both High King Derid Kendrick of Alaron and King Rault the Wise of Norland desired to reclaim the fortress for themselves, and were said to be willing to handsomely reward anyone who assisted them.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Under Northlander ownership, the great fortress was home to the rulers of Oman as well as to their slaves.</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, an ettin named Hathfell was tasked by the giants of Oman with keeping the Iron Keep out of enemy hands. He and a small company of orcs and ogres occupied the keep, but were not particularly vigilant.</p>
