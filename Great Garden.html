<p>The Great Garden was a wonder found within the fortress of Krak al-Mazhar in the Great Anvil of the Haunted Lands in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Descriptions</h2>
<p>The garden was found deep underground beneath the fortress. It was filled with beautiful flora and a bubbling marble fountain, all of which were real. The pristine blue sky and bird and insect sounds filling the garden were all an elaborate illusion.</p>
<p>The garden measured roughly 100 ft (30 m) in diameter, but cleverly designed illusions made it appear endless. The paths traversing the garden had a maze-like effect upon occupants. Only those who knew the secret command word were immune to this effect.</p>
<p>The "sky" over the garden mimicked the same cycles that occurred above the fortress. A constant gentle breeze caressed every area of the Great Garden.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Nar-Aidiya enjoyed relaxing in the garden when he was able to find time. A tasked slayer genie named Mujibur served as caretaker and guardian of the garden.</p>
