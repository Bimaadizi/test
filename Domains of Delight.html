<p>The Domains of Delight were a grouping of demiplanes found in the Feywild , each of which was ruled by an archfey .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Some domains were difficult to gain admittance within, often being obscured by an obfuscating barrier or protected by pass phrase, puzzle, or more simply the archfey's discretion.</p>
<h2>Cosmology</h2>
<p>Individual Domains of Delight were accessible from other planes by the same means used to travel to the Feywild, including fey crossings , and the plane shift spell.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Domains of Delight each varied in size, from the size of a small field to an entire nation, depending on the power of the ruling archfey. The most powerful of the archfey, namely Titania and the Queen of Air and Darkness , held power that extended well beyond their own Domains of Delight, across nearly the entirety of the Feywild.</p>
<p>When neighboring domains overlapped with one another, the residents of the contested area were beholden to the authority of each archfey. These instances often led to contention between their respective powers.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Domains of Delight were often home to myriad awakened creatures, fey creatures, and other rarely-encountered beasts, including: boggles , brigganocks , displacer beasts , harengon , blink dogs , darklings , faerie dragons , various hags , and jabberwocks .</p>
