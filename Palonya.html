<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1479 DR, Sister Palonya arrived at the Yawning Portal inn with Brother Sepulcher . Palonya went inside Undermountain to replace the previous priest of Jergal assigned to catalog the bodies inside some particular Undermountain tombs, while Sepulcher waited. However she was captured by the vampire Dayan and placed among his prisoners inside a room full of necromantic glyphs that siphoned energy from creatures experiencing anger, pain, fear, or other negative emotions. Thanks to it, Palonya lost her memory.</p>
