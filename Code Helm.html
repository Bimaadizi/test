<p>Code Helm was an organization based on the planet Glyth in the mid‒14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Code Helm was focused on destroying the mind flayers . They funded their operation from loot gathered from mind flayer spelljammers . While not technically a mercenary company, if offered money and a chance to slay illithids, Code Helm would likely take the offer.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The company resided in an outpost within the third ring of Glyth, unless they were actively transporting rescued persons to their homes.</p>
<h2>Membership</h2>
<p>Members of Code Helm were brave men and women devotees of Helm who lived outside Toril . Many were clerics of Helm, but most were actually paladins of other gods dedicated to Code Helm's ideals. Helm granted both his own clerics and these paladins a special spell of mental prowess for joining Code Helm.</p>
<p>In the mid‒14 th century DR, the leader of the group was Easel Gifford of Amn , a paladin of Torm . The group was ruled under a strict, military-like hierarchy, originally by the priests of Helm, but since so many other religions (80%) were involved, this was changed.</p>
