<p>Hardflow , or concrete , was a composite construction material used in the Realms alongside mortar , cement , and asphalt .</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>While the base stone for hardflow was supplied by dwarves from the crushed-up rubble of their mining excavation projects, it was usually processed by human wizards who used magical artifice to make the finished product. Concrete was most often handled and installed by dwarven architects, and was also commonly used by urban halfling , gnome , and human builders as well. It was sometimes used for the construction of large, solid forms such as floors and drains, but was most often used for sealing gaps.</p>
<p>Concrete and similar products were very common in Lantan , which had also developed reinforced concrete. The recipes and methods involved in these materials were often closely-held family secrets for the Lantanna, as it was for other bespoke materials such as plastic .</p>
