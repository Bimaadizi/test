<p>The tavern was a favorite of Shaless of Tsurlagol , an adventurer . In Nightal of the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , she returned to The Drunken Dragon and there displayed a selection of curious harps and beautiful, magical blades that she claimed to have found in Myth Drannor . Maerhult , a bard also visiting the tavern, examined two of her harps and pronounced them to be genuine works of old Myth Drannor.</p>
