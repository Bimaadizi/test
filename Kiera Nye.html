<p>Kiera Nye was the owner of The Whistling Gallows inn of Lonelywood in Icewind Dale in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kiera was a human woman with a light skin tone and light chestnut hair. Circa 1373 DR , Kiera was still a young and pretty woman.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Kiera inherited the Whistling Gallows from her great-grandfather, Kieran Nye . She also inherited Kieran's talent for magic and kept his study filled with books on the arcane and other wizardly paraphernalia, hidden behind a mirror in her room on the inn's first floor.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Kiera Nye was already running The Whistling Gallows, offering food, drink, and lodgings to the town's visitors, and happily shared the story of the inn's curious name and its original grizzly ogrish proprietor. She was in charge of the inn when the town of Lonelywood became afflicted by restless sleep and draining nightmares. She, like everyone in the town, fell victim to the strange curse. However, its source was uncovered â€“ the night hag named Agaza , and, subsequently lifted, by the famed Hero of Neverwinter .</p>
