<p>Beef and Oysters Barnabus was a dish known in Faerûn in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Combined with wild rice , the dish comprised beef and, unfortunately for some, oysters .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Eleint of the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , in Ghars in Cormyr , Barthelm Meadowbrock planned to have Beef and Oysters Barnabas for the welcoming dinner at the Sheaf of Wheat inn for the upcoming Grand Council of the Merchants' Guild . He ordered a butt of Westgate Ruby from Shortshanks of the Bold Bard tavern, swearing it was the only wine to have with Beef and Oysters Barnabas.</p>
<p>At the dinner on Eleint 19 , it was the most popular dish on offer, with the councilmen queuing up and coming back for more, though this was mostly due to the beautiful Mayella Meadowbrock doing the serving. Even Jasper had seconds, despite hating oysters.</p>
