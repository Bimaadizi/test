<p>Sylmae Auglamyr was a sorceress of Cormanthyr working for Coronal Eltargrim in the 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 241 DR , she and five other sorceresses joined the Coronal in going down to the Vault of Ages after the High Court Mages refused. The sorceresses later convened on the sky over the palace and some balefire, where she pointed out which Houses had to be watched for, expecting they would respond violently to the recent events such as the naming of a human , Elminster, as armathor. After he was slain in a hunt, she was chosen to truth-scry Selgauth Cathdeiryn , one of the survivors of the hunt, presumably also Elminster Aumar 's slayer. She then took part in the protection of Mythanthor , getting first assigned to making a web of spells that listened for anyone speaking of him.</p>
<p>In 261 DR she helped defend Eltargrim after Llombaerth Starym and his army attempted to overthrow the Coronal, and then carried the arrows from Starym's army into the chamber where they wove the Mythal . She remained at the ready, as a witness when Symrustar Auglamyr helped fight Uldreiyn Starym , and almost struck her down too.</p>
