<p>Cormorants , also called sea-skry , were dark-feathered raucous birds that dwelt in the costal areas and fed by diving for fish.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Even though both, sea gulls and cormorants were foul-tasting fowl, in the village of Ulgoth's Beard , these sea birds were often brought down with well-placed stone throws as they dived for fish. These birds were then boiled with several types of local vegetables, such as leeks , thrae , durfists , and seasoned generously. This local greasy stew was called gudgeon .</p>
<p>In the eastern realm of Kara-Tur , cormorants were sometimes trained by fishers to retrieve fish for their masters. These cormorants were outfitted with silver rings around tier necks to prevent the birds from swallowing their prey.</p>
<p>Cormorants and black egrets plagued the Farsea Marshes of Cormyr . And nested in the towers of Sumbria on the shores of Akanamere .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1357 DR , a human barbarian from Kara-Tur, Yu Fu Fang used trained cormorants to fish in the waters of Hungtse River .</p>
