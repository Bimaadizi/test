<h2>History</h2>
<p>On 28 Uktar of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Traya was a member of a group of eight apprentices, including her teacher, who spent an overnight hunting trip in the Pellamcopse Woods . She was not very useful at helping hunt, but she managed to collect a number of berries instead. On the return trip to Waterdeep , she was carrying a large basket of herbs , when they all passed a thief named Raegar Stoneblade , who had been secretly stalking them. To avoid suspicion, he pretended to be bathing himself in a barrel of cold rain water, which confused Traya, and he flirted with her and her teacher. The ruse appeared to work, as the group were unaware of his significance at the time.</p>
