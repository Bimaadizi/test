<p>Tyaa Tymmyr was an assassin of the Night Masks in 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tyaa was born in Daerlun as a scion of a merchant family and lived in wealth and privilege until a business partner of her father slaughtered all her family. Only Tyaay survived and she escaped to Westgate , where she joined the church of Leira . By 1358 DR , she had risen through the ranks of the church, but the death of her goddess during the Time of Troubles forced Tyaa to go into hiding again.</p>
<p>She decided to join the Night Masks and become an assassin. With the death of Victor Dhostar , no-one in the Night Masks still sought missing worshipers of Leira, and Tyaa discovered she enjoyed her new life. She commanded an elite assassin team specializing in killing hard-target merchants both in Westgate and Sembia . Tyaa greatly enjoyed killing old rivals of the father.</p>
