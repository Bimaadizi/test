<p>Irmakul "Bloodthews" was a priest of Ilmater from Memnon , Calimshan , of the 3rd century DR . Irmakul was an Archsufferer in the Church of Ilmater and helped create the legendary sword Dornavver , the "Demonbane".</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>To counter the growing spread of evil under the Shoon Imperium and a plethora of evil artifacts fashioned at the time, the Church of Ilmater sought a weapon to combat such evil. To this end, the sword Dornavver was completed in the Year of the Wrath Sword, 275 DR . As recorded in Relics of the Righteous , the senior clergy of Ilmater took the sword and gathered at Allyn's Anvil in the Alimir Mountains east of Calimshan . Irmakul was present, along with Revered Brother Filithan and Exalted Servant Volshur the Crooked and many others of the church. There they conducted a holy ritual in which their impassioned prayers and howls of suffering enchanted the sword.</p>
