<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid–14 th century DR , a farmer from Thunderstone named Del Geery used the dried skin of a hydra to make coverings for his raspberry , blueberry, and strawberry bushes. This covering kept the air around them at a cool 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius), extending their growing period deep into autumn. The hydra hides proved to be effective only on these three types of berry bush.</p>
