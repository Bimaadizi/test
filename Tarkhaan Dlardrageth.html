<p>Tarkhaan Dlardrageth was a daemonfey who had departed from House Dlardrageth in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>His son, Bishtek Dlardrageth , barely knew him. Tarkhaan inflicted great pain on the boy in order to help him blend into human society before leaving him with gifts of gold and in the care of servants.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tarkhaan Dlardrageth was long imprisoned beneath Ascalhorn with Sarya Dlardrageth . During the Cormanthor War in the years before the Spellplague , Tarkhaan fought alongside Sarya. After her defeat at the hands of Seiveril Miritar , he lost his will to keep fighting, and fled to Baldur's Gate on the Sword Coast rather than join his cousins as they regrouped. While in Baldur's Gate, he somehow managed to live without drawing suspicion.</p>
<p>When his son, Bishtek, was born, his mother died in childbirth. Tarkhaan elected to have doctors surgically excise his son's tell-tale demonic features, notably his wings, tail, and spines along his back. This left the child horribly scarred.</p>
<p>Bishtek would never know for certain whether his father had left House Dlardrageth of his own volition or had been banished.</p>
