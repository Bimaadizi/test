<p>Thuchir was a dragonborn of Abeir , a descendant of Haizverad , and an ancestor of Clan Shestandeliath .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the dragonborn rebellion , Tuchir was the bearer of the Breath of Petron .</p>
<p>Thuchir was one of the dragonborn clan leaders who took part in the battle of the Crippled Mountain . He sacrificed part of his lungs by using the Breath of Petron to open an entrance to the Celestial Mountain , allowing Iskdara , Shurideh , and Reshvemi to kill the dragon overlord Rhodrolytharnestrix .</p>
<p>Thuchir survived the final battle, however, and was one of the founders of Tymanchebar , and presumably, he was one of the first patriarchs of Clan Shestandeliath.</p>
