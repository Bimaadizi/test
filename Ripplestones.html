<p>Ripplestones was a village on the Dragon Coast between Westgate and Starmantle in the mid–8 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ripplestones had a bridge on the Westgate side; it was uneven and rough, with a sign on the Ripplestones side. Past the bridge, the main road of the village turned around Scorchstone Hall , a small manor surrounded by a thicket of trees and thorny bushes. The cottages of Caladaster and Baerdagh were close to it. There was a tavern, the Fair Maid . In particular, Baerdagh passed the bend in the road by Scorchstone when going from his house to the Fair Maid.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The road towards Starmantle went along the coast for some miles.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Elminster Aumar , a Chosen of Mystra , went to Ripplestones in the Year of the Awakening Wyrm, 767 DR ; there, he shared a meal with two local elderly men, Caladaster and Baerdagh, from whom he learned about Scorchstone Hall, where the sorceress Sharindala had dwelt. Later, the elven mage Ilbryn Starym came from Westgate too, pursuing Elminster; he left as soon as he learned where the man was. Three people arrived later, the scholars Tabarast and Beldrune , accompanied by a nameless Harper who was also seeking Elminster; they too left after a single meal, accompanied by Caladaster.</p>
<p>Days later, the High Duke of Langalos , Horostos , sent an immense caravan out to see if the Slayer would be daunted or somehow stopped by a force of that size. The caravan stopped at Ripplestones, just in time for Sharindala to come to the Fair Maid.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>It was said that Sharindala still walked the halls of Scorchstone Hall. This was true, but it was also said she was a moaning spirit, when Sharindala was actually mute because of her undeath.</p>
