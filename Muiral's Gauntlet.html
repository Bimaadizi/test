<p>Muiral's Gauntlet was the 10 th level of Undermountain , one of the sub-levels of the Twisted Caverns . [ citationÂ needed ] It was claimed by Muiral the Misshapen after he chased out the drow forces that once called the domain their home. As of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the level was left neglected in a state of disrepair.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Upon first glance, the halls of the Gauntlet resembled the winding, labyrinthine style that was quite popular among the drow of the Underdark . However, Muiral reshaped them to a rather grand scale, with corridors that often spanned 20' (6.1 m) wide and 20' tall. Many portions of the Gauntlet were enchanted by permanent versions of the guards and wards spell, to the confusion and ire of anyone trapped within.</p>
<p>Despite Muiral's changes, many examples of drow culture continued to line the Gauntlet's halls. Many of its walls were still decorated with carvings and mosaics that dated back to its dark elf founders. These passageways were all dimly lit, save for the original faerie fire enchantments that provided limited illumination.</p>

<h3>Entrances</h3>
<h3>Notable Locations</h3>
<p>Along the sides chamber were piles of humanoid remains, comprised of the dismembered dark elves and various adventurers that wandered into the gauntlet. Beneath these piles of bones and other body parts were a number of ghouls , the results of Muiral's experimentation.</p>
<h3>Exits</h3>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , the following paths could be used to exit Muiral's Gauntlet:</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The following peoples inhabited this level as of 1492 DR:</p>
<p>Sometime before the mid-14 th century, a crystal ooze infiltrated the cold-water pool within the communal baths. Due to the steam provided from the hot spring pool, it was nigh-undetectable.</p>
<p>The drow temple was home to the ghost of its former High Priestess, haunting the sanctuary she was was dedicated to in life. The spectral servitor was accompanied by a number of banshees , the undead forms of priestesses Charinidia , Grazthrae and T'riizlin , who were turned by Lolth due to their excessive vanity. A single banshee lived beyond the temple in some dark, cloistered room. It was unknown if they were the spectral form of yet another priestess of Lolth.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before it was taken over by Muiral, centuries before the Time of Troubles , this domain served as a living quarters and academy for a colony of drow that lived beneath Mount Waterdeep . It was quite a serene place for the drow; the communal baths were especially pleasing as they featured displays of art, live music and refreshments that were carried in by servants.</p>
<p>For some unknown reason, they were forced to abandon their home here, leaving behind significant evidence of their society that since fell to decay. Many of the halls became infested by subterranean creatures such as rot grubs , green slimes , or became haunted by the undead remnants of their former inhabitants.</p>
<p>When Muiral discovered the remnants of the drow realm, he reshaped it to his will. Somewhat ironically, he repurposed much of the hated dark elves' dwellings towards his own designs. Throughout the years Muiral filled the Gauntlet with monstrous creatures that amused him and trained them to remain within their respective regions and not interfere with the level's other beings.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR , the four dwarven adventurers of Falkir's Fist were killed in one of the rooms in the western portion of the Gauntlet. They had just made it one of Muiral's mirror- gates but were killed before they could escape.</p>
