<p>Aberrant spheres were magical devices that summoned aberrations to the user.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The surfaces of such spheres seemed to flash words in the speaker's native tongue, just visible enough to remain unidentifiable.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The spheres renewed their three charges each day. By spending one charge, a choker was summoned; by spending two charges, a grick was summoned instead; and by spending three charges, the creature summoned was a carrion crawler . The summoned creature remained for slightly more than half a minute, commensurate with the power of the spheres themselves. For as long as the monster was still present, the owner's mind became more vulnerable.</p>
<p>On summoning the monster, the sphere shattered, reforming after their departure or destruction; no more than one monster could be summoned at a time.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These spheres were created by alienists and other cultists who worshiped aberrant entities. Zceryll was known to have created her own.</p>
