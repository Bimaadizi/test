<p>Drusilla was an eccentric alchemist who lived in her old houseboat tethered to the Fisher's Wharf in Eastway of Baldur's Gate III in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Drusilla's oddly-decorated houseboat was always left behind when the neighboring fishing vessels departed early each morning. The entrance to the boat's interior was draped in canvas and bushels of drying herbs . The houseboat's interior was filled with boiling concoctions, various fluids, books , and other miscellanies.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Several years before the Year of the Purloined Statue, 1477 DR , Drusilla hired an adventurer-detective named Tav to track down her lost talisman . It was the detective's first case, and it ended in success. When a dire murder took place on the nearby Sailor's Crossing plaza in on Kythorn 19 of 1477 DR , Drusilla was interviewed by Tav over a cup of hot tea . During the interview, Drusilla placed an terra cotta urn decorated with a cameo of her sister and filled with her remains. Even though Cate was long dead, Drusilla served her tea with honeycomb as she liked it in life.</p>
<p>Drusilla told Tav that after a commotion, she witnessed a figure fleeing towards Heapside . She recommended the detective visit the Blushing Mermaid for information on Baldur's Gate's seedy underbelly. Before parting ways, Drusilla gifted Tav a potion of invisibility . As the investigator left the aging alchemist's boat, a scream came from the Canary Lane .</p>
