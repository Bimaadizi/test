<p>Harfang was a sailor and the Captain of the Lustrous Lass in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Harfang was gaunt-faced half-orcish woman with a clean-shaven head.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Captain Harfang sailed the Lustrous Lass to the Crone Island , where she made a deal with the Gloom Crone . For days after, Captain Harfang was the hairiest she'd ever been. She was granted "enough gold to last the rest of her life," but soon enough, the Captain realized that the bag of gold contained only six real gold pieces among the dross. As soon as she tossed the false gold aboard, Harfang came down with an illness. She heard a creature scurrying and scratching in her baggage that sounded bigger than just a rat . Harfang locked herself away in her cabin trying to stay away from the creature, in reality a cursed imp that spread the disease , and to isolate the sickness. But that was no use as the sea plague ended the lives of the entire crew in a bit over a tenday after the hag deal was made.</p>
<p>The bodies of the dead, including Captain Harfang, were left aboard the Lustrous Lass and quarantined by the Flaming Fist after the ship drifted into the harbors of Baldur's Gate .</p>
