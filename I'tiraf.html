<p>I'tiraf was a large city that served as the capital of the federation of Pantheist cities in 1367 DR . The governing body of the region, the League Conclave , was located here.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>

<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Like all Cities of the Pantheon, I'tiraf held to strict moral standards and exclusive belief in the five Gods of the Pantheon . Citizens strongly believed in the comparative barbarism of people from outside the Pantheist League, and the city had a reputation for finding out breakers of the law and punishing them swiftly, leading to its title "City of Confessions".</p>
