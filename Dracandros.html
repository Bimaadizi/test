<p>Dracandros of the Crimson was an exiled Red Wizard of Thay in Battledale in 1357 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dracandros was a promising but megalomaniac Red Wizard. He was stripped of all his property and exiled from Thay after he attacked a mind flayer ambassador during a dinner party.</p>
<p>He dreamed of unleashing a new Flight of Dragons and managed to ally with the dracolich Crimdrac and to obtain the powerful Helm of Dragons .</p>
<p>Dracandros later relocated to the small village of Hap , which he conquered thanks to his drow mercenaries and efreeti and salamander minions. At this point, Tyranthraxus offered to Dracandros to join the New Alliance and he agreed.</p>
<p>Dracandros at last was killed by the adventuring party possessing the Azure Bonds .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Dracandros was crazy. He believed himself one of the most powerful Red Wizards and did not understand the reasons for his exile. He was obsessed with unleashing a new Flight of Dragons, believing this was the key to returning in glory to Thay .</p>
