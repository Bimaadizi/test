<h2>History</h2>
<p>One of these cloaks was discovered by the shapeshifting druid Cernd , when he spent a year traveling through Faerûn meditating upon his role in the grand balance of nature. Shortly before the cold season set in, Cernd found the cloak within the High Forest. His cloak appeared to have been woven from the undergrowth of the forest.</p>
<p>Yet another cloak of the High Forest was discovered by the future Great Druid Jasswin , when he spent a season never living under shelter in an attempt to "feel the land unhindered". Prior to the cold season of that particular year, the wind blew the cloak to him. In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Nyatar , a druid from Neverwinter owned a cloak of the High Forest .</p>
