<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>It was a popular belief that Derque Rillyn had a foul temper.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Clerebold had an idea he passed along to his cousin, Derque Rillyn, to his usual praise. Clerebold suggested that Nortale's Hostel , a non-profit hostel used to help refugees during the Absolute crisis , should be renamed after Derque's daddy – Hir Rillyn's Hostel, in order to convince him to donate a "good old chunk of change" in aid of the establishment and possibly even a bit of extra coin for Derque himself. This ingenious idea was born from Derque's annual donations to Hostel Mother Pammella Nortale 's establishment, who, due to strife, pleaded with the noble for a larger sum. However, Derque overstepped his allowance. He could not secure additional funds from her daddy and was unable to get extra dowry coin from the soon-to-be bride – Henrietta Hhune , daughter of Hurlbut Hhune .</p>
