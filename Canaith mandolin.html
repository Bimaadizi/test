<p>A Canaith mandolin ( pronounced : / k ɑː ˈ n eɪ θ / ka-NAYTH listen ) was a masterwork magic mandolin and one of the Instruments of the Bards .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Canaith mandolins were 8-string mandolins. Like other Instruments of the Bards, they could only be used properly by bards , and could be dangerous if anyone else attempted to play or even carry them.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Bards wielding a Canaith mandolin had their charming abilities greatly amplified by their magic.</p>
<p>Like all Instruments of the Bards, these mandolins had the capability of storing spells. A bard playing a Canaith mandolin could invoke the spells fly , invisibility , levitate , protection from evil and good , cure wounds , dispel magic and protection from lightning each once a day, until the instrument recharged its magic at the next dawn.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first Canaith mandolins were created by a legendary bard in the Moonshae Isles named Falataer . He used them to test and reward the students of the Canaith level of his bardic college, which came to be regarded individually as a legendary bard college in its own right.</p>
<p>Over time, other bards have copied the original design, while retaining the original name in Falataer's honor.</p>
