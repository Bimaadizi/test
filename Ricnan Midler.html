<p>Ricnan Midler was the head of the extended Midler family in the mid-1480s DR , who lived together in the Midler farmhouse near Eveningstar in Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ricnan was a middle-aged man with tied-back brown hair and a neat brown waistcoat outfit.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Ricnan was the son of Neris and Ianhand , and brother of Quilynn . He had wed Jandove , and together they had their two sons Normon and Thoben .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar , the drow forces of Vicala Szind attacked the farmhouse and captured the entire family alive so that she could interrogate them about the Thread of the Weave . Unknown to the drow, the houseservant Maisby had escaped back to Eveningstar and sought help, getting first a pair of Purple Dragons and then a team of adventurers to investigate the farmhouse. Unfortunately, Vicala Szind had set all ten Midlers and Chandlers as part of a sacrificial life-draining spell, and the rescuers would have had to stealthily rescue each family member without Vicala noticing, lest she spitefully kill them.</p>
<p>Ricnan was held captive in the kitchen of the house, alongside his sister Quilynn and his son Normon, guarded by several drow invaders.</p>
