<p>Nishrek was a fiendish plane in the World Tree cosmology model and later an astral dominion in the World Axis cosmology model. Prior to the discovery of the World Tree , it was Gruumsh 's realm in Acheron , occupying one face of a gigantic cube (and then later, the whole cube ) as described by the Great Wheel cosmology model. Nishrek was the last known home of the orc pantheon , which tended to wander or be forced out of various previous homes.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nishrek was once just the name of Gruumsh's realm, stuck to the side of a moon-sized cube floating in the air of Acheron. As new cosmologies were invented to explain what planar travelers discovered, the name followed Gruumsh to new realms and became synonymous with the plane he dominated. Endless war was a constant across all cosmological models, made possible by the positive-dominant feature of this plane—all those who died in battle were raised at sunset to fight again the next night.</p>
<h3>Great Wheel Model</h3>
<p>As a realm in Acheron, Nishrek was a square, flat, barren plain broken only by trenches dug for defense, conical pits and mountains, perhaps a segment of the River Styx , and the occasional iron citadel, which the orcs and other evil races merely occupied until the tide of battle pushed or pulled them elsewhere. The main conflicts were between the orcs and the goblins , but there was plenty of inter-tribe squabbling as well.</p>
<h3>World Tree Model</h3>
<p>When the World Tree cosmology supplanted the Great Wheel model, Nishrek became its own plane, which the orcs had all to themselves, but without much improvement in the environment, although there was at least a sea and some hills. It was an immeasurable plane with battlements, entrenchments, and fortresses, contested over nightly by petitioners who healed quickly and even regenerated lost limbs. If they fell in battle, they received a true resurrection at the next sunset and joined the battle again. Each tribe vied for the favor of Gruumsh, whom they believed would someday declare a winner and thereby raise the status of their tribe above all others.</p>
<h3>World Axis Model</h3>
<p>When the Spellplague caused Nishrek to be cast adrift upon the Astral Sea , it changed from being a practically limitless plain to a finite dominion with a more varied landscape—dense forests, broiling deserts, flinty badlands, murky rivers and foreboding seas—all bearing the ravages of constant war. Like Warrior's Rest , this plane tallied untold deaths but no losses, as each combatant rose to fight again and again.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The only creatures tenacious enough to call Nishrek home were swarms of hellwasps , which could ruin the best-laid battle plans very quickly. Rust dragons were also seen on this plane, as well as styx dragons where the River of Blood ran its course. Orc and half-orc (including orog and tanarukk ) petitioners made up the vast majority of the population, organized by tribe and faction. After the Spellplague, ogres and trolls saw Nishrek in the afterlife , when Vaprak became an exarch of Gruumsh.</p>
