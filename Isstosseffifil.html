<p>Isstosseffifil was a sarrukh empire during the Days of Thunder .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Isstosseffifil occupied the previously fertile lands of Anauroch from the eastern shores of the ancient Narrow Sea to the Plain of Standing Stones , and reached from the Saiyaddar to the High Ice .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>The leadership body, called the Sh'arrim, was made up of five to eight members of the most powerful clans. They elected an emperor, and formed a council with Sh'arrim from other sarrukh empires called the Kazim. They met in Okoth , and the Kazim had authority to make laws over the entire race if they achieved a unanimous vote.</p>
<p>The sarrukh of Isstosseffifil kept slaves of other species, while each sarrukh lived in comfort like their leaders. They created the asabi , Stingtails , and other reptilian races able to dwell in the depths of the Underdark .</p>
<p>The Ba'etith , a scholarly society who studied and collected magic from across the realms, eventually creating the Nether Scrolls , were founded in Isstosseffifil, and would outlast the empire.</p>
<p>The liches of Oreme, all that remained after the fall of the empire, created their own governing body, with one lich at a time taking the title of King Oreme and remaining active while the others slept.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In −34,500 DR , Isstosseffifil rose to prominence on the eastern shore of the Narrow Sea. Throughout the Days of Thunder, they ruled much of the land that would one day become Anauroch.</p>
<p>In −33,800 DR , the Isstosseffifil empire's wizards rerouted the Narrow Sea in an effort to drown the phaerimm inhabiting Phaerlin . This resulted in a massive ecological change that devastated their empire.</p>
<p>Eventually, the survivors, including the Terraseer , retreated into lichdom below Oreme, protected by their asabi servants.</p>
