<p>Delhumide was a city in the tharch of the same name , located in northeastern Thay .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Thay had been a Mulhorandi colony, around 1000 years before Dale Reckoning , Delhumide was one of its greatest cities and bastions of power. When the Red Wizards rebelled, they destroyed the town, using the darkest sort of sorcery to accomplish their task.</p>
<p>In 1375 DR , the ground where the city's ruins still stood was still unclean. Demons walked there and a man could suffer from madness or leprosy just by venturing there. Shattered battlements and toppled towers could be seen though many of the buildings remained essentially intact.</p>
