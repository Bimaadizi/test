<p>The man only remembered by the name Raymond was a Duke from the town of Delthuntle in Aglarond sometime before 1368 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Duke Raymond lived sometime after Delthuntle's founding circa 1170 DR and before 1368 DR . For several years, the man was locked in a bitter rivalry with the Duke of Spandeliyon , Edwall Dest . Eventually, their antagonism reached its pinnacle in a shooting competition. The winner of the competition was to be declared the superior archer between the two. Dukes Raymond and Edwall both wielded powerful enchanted bows . But Raymond's weapon, later known as Dead Shot , was stolen by the Duke of Spandeliyon before the competition. Edwall entered the shooting match confident in his advantage, exulting in his inevitable victory. However, Duke Raymond planned a surprise of his own. He demanded his opponent demonstrate his proficiency in sharpshooting on a scarecrow that bore an eerie resemblance to Edwall Dest himself. The Duke of Spandeliyon aimed and sent an arrow straight at the dummy's head. He did not miss and split the target's head in two. At the same time as the poppet 's head split, so did Duke Dest's.</p>
