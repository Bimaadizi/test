<p>The church of Torm , also known as the True and Loyal as well as the Watchful Guardians , was the collection of faithful followers of Torm , god of duty and loyalty, and the patron deity of paladins as well as the god of courage and self-sacrifice. It was one of the most popular faiths throughout Faerûn , having grown in prevalence and influence as Torm became a greater power during the Era of Upheaval .</p>
<p>The faith itself was referred to as the True Faith or the Unbending Way of Torm . Collectively, Torm's clergy were dubbed the Tormtar or Tormish , while his followers were known as Tormish , or Tormar .</p>
<h2>Dogma</h2>
<p>The tenets of Torm's church involved obedience to duty and loyalty to one's allies. Tormish clergy and laypeople were directed to uphold virtuousness, maintain order throughout the Realms, and strike out against corrupt and evil forces. Serving others in these causes was the truest path to deliverance of the spirit and the best means to honor Torm himself. Disobedience was to be punished quickly and severely.</p>
<p>All followers of Torm were expected to demonstrate devotion to their faith, their family, their superiors, and all goodly beings of the Realms.</p>
<p>Torm requires the following:</p>
<p>By 1480 DR , the creed of Torm's church dictated: " Be loyal, obedient, and dutiful, up-holding laws, rules, and the most ethical stances through both unwavering support and armed vigilance. Seek corruption constantly and stamp it out. Give swift but brutal death to traitors. Where laws are unjust or flawed, urge improvements and alternatives rather than a confusion of ever more laws. Train law keepers and judges to be just, and watch over them to ensure that they perform with impartiality. Serve with all your heart as well as all your reason. Every failure of duty diminishes the Loyal Fury; every success empowers him and brightens the world. Be vigilant always. Question your actions and stances rather than sinking into the sin of self-righteousness. Torm watches you, and expects you to watch and guide others. "</p>
<h3>Attitudes</h3>
<p>Followers of Torm conveyed gratitude for the opportunity serve the mortals of the Realms. They did not act for personal acclaim accept any material rewards but rather for the personal fulfillment of making the world a safer and more just place to live. Anyone found guilty of garnering wealth while carrying out the church's tenets would be offered penance for minor infractions but would be immediately excommunicated in other instances.</p>
<p>The church did not consider the hoarding of arms and weaponry as inherently wicked but abstained from doing so as a matter of practical caution.</p>
<p>While some individuals resented the overbearing influence the Tormish church held over their daily lives, many accepted it as a necessary burden to live a life free from oppression.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Torm's church was organized into three tiers, separated from the others by both the caliber and duration of service to the faith.</p>
<h3>Titles</h3>
<p>The highest tier of Torm's church comprised the Tormtar, and included the following titles in descending order (along with associated color robes or pigmented armor ): Champion ( dusky purple ), Vanguardier ( amethyst ), Knight ( deep blue ), Guardian ( sky blue ), Enforcer ( deep green ), Loyan ( pale green ), Watchful Venturer ( yellow ), Vigilant ( orange ), Warden ( dark amber ), Faithblade ( rose red ), Anduran ( crimson ), and Unproven ( uncolored ), the faith's novices. Other titles were bestowed upon Tormtar that undertook specific duties. These included: Priest Inquisitor, High Priest, Templemaster, Seneschal, Doorwarden, Revered Messenger, and Patrol Captain.</p>
<p>For a time following the death of Tyr , the title of High Justiciar was incorporated into the hierarchy of the church.</p>
<p>The second tier of the church encompassed the numerous knightly orders that undertook charges and quests in his name. Regardless of the order of which they were a member, these holy champions were collectively known as the Swords of Torm.</p>
<p>The third and lowest-ranking tier of the church included all the laypeople that venerated Torm as their patron deity. This group included folks from all walks of life, including many soldiers and city officials. Despite not having membership within they Tormish clergy, they were expected to uphold the tenets of the faith and offer regular tithing to their local temple or shrine.</p>
<h3>Orders</h3>
<h3>Classes</h3>
<p>About two out of five members of Torm's church were specialty priests , that took on the role of either holy champions or paragons . Clerics, crusaders , and paladins , specifically those of the Oaths of Devotion and the Crown , composed the rest of his clergy. These Tormtar were also accompanied in their services by a number of divine champions and disciples .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Tormtar clergy set out to overthrow corrupt officials that garnered positions of power by unscrupulous means, and offer ethical alternatives in their place. They rooted out unjust and racist laws from the realms in which they were active and stymied efforts by leaders to conquer neighboring lands. When necessary, they were to exact lethal judgement against those that betrayed the trust of others. To accomplish their aims, the clergy integrated themselves into political organizations and governments across the Realms, except for those run by despots and tyrants.</p>
<p>Additionally, regularly provided aid and resources to all manner of valorous knights, dutiful guardians, and honest courtiers in the nations across Faerûn .</p>
<p>Followers of Torm that took up the adventuring lifestyle were granted much freedom while questing, but were required to regularly report back to church officials. They were dispatched as explorers to learn more about the realms outside their spheres of influence. They were directed to offer significant tithings, upwards of half the riches they acquired during their travels.</p>
<h3>Penance of Duty</h3>
<p>Following the church's actions taken during the Time of Troubles , Torm himself directed his faithful undertake acts of penitence, in response to their collective moral failings. From that time on, all of his followers would undertake the Penance of Duty, three debts that were to regularly be repaid to the folks of the Realms.</p>
<h2>Rituals</h2>
<p>Torm's followers offered a specific litany of prayers to their god at dawn, noon, dusk, and finally at midnight. They would make additional prayers as warranted, such as in the case of great personal need or crisis. Clerics specifically prayed for their spells at dawn.</p>
<p>Clergy members carried out several different rituals , one on a recurring basis, and the others on special occasions. Three special rituals were the minimal requirements for the priesthood. The ritual of Torm's Table involved offering a bountiful meal to someone in need once every two months, to be enjoyed while the offering priest fasted. Whenever a layperson became a full-fledged priest they completed the ritual of Investiture , and then fulfilled the Holy Vigil whenever they ascended in rank within the church's hierarchy.</p>
<h2>Celebrations</h2>
<p>The church of Torm celebrated a few different holidays that were marked on the Calendar of Harptos .</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>Initiates of Torm were able to channel the power of their faith when striking against of the followers of their god's most-hated foes, namely those of Bane, Cyric, or their progenitors, Bhaal , Myrkul , and Iyachtu Xvim .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<h3>Regions</h3>
<p>Torm's faith was prevalent throughout the Dalelands , the Shining Lands , Tethyr , Ulgarth , the Vast , especially within the city of Tantras , and even became the state religion of Elturgard upon its founding in the 1430s DR.</p>
<p>Some scholars speculated that Chalsembyr , the ancient kingdom Torm ruled over as a mortal in the -4 th century DR, was located somewhere within the Border Kingdoms south of the Lake of Steam .</p>
<p>There was a small village on the Sword Coast named Torm's Hand . Due to the Spellplague that led to the deaths of Tyr and Helm , Torm's faith spread in Neverwinter of the Sword Coast North .</p>
<h3>Temples</h3>
<p>Temples of Torm were often constructed out of white granite , set upon the upper slops of mountains or other peaks that offered a commanding view over the surrounding landscape. These impenetrable keeps were designed to embody Torm's stately defiance against the evils of the world. They were often made of white granite and decorated with statues of lions and knights in gleaming armor, adorned with mementos taken from the dutiful Tormtar fallen heroes.</p>
<p>Some of the most prominent or famous churches of Torm included:</p>
<p>Other temples could be found in Eagle Peak , Halfhap , Hawk's Nest , Orvyltar , Shadowdusk Hold in Undermountain , Teziir , Torm's Hand near Baldur's Gate , and Weatherstone Keep .</p>

<h2>Equipment, Spells, and Relics</h2>
<p>Torm's holy symbol comprised a gauntleted right hand, palm held upwards or extended forward, known as the Hand Resolute . To Torm's followers it symbolized restraint and temperance , and forbearance. Another symbol was a silver or gray metal shield bearing the Hand Resolute with three black arrows embedded in the shield. The Hand Resolute slightly changed by 1479 DR . By 1489 DR , the symbol became a white right gauntlet (a white gauntlet made for the right hand). The Tormish temples, civic structures, and the homes of the faithful are often decorated with the Hand Resolute images as a contrast reminder of the principle: the just and true must pause for action to judge if their intention upholds Torm's ideals.</p>
<p>Tormish faith tokens allowed the bearers to cast the spells guidance and virtue .</p>
<h3>Dress</h3>
<p>Priests of Torm wore either clean robes complete with a breastplate and bracers or an immaculate set of plate mail armor with an elaborately decorated helm. Their robes and armor were dyed or tinted with ink to denote different ranks , the latter of which were inscribed with Torm's Penance of Duty .</p>
<h3>Weapons and Arms</h3>
<p>Tormtar kept and used the best weapons and armor available to them. Their weapons were immaculately maintained and their armor polished at all times, save those occasions when doing so would get in the way of their duties.</p>
<p>Followers of Torm treasured a type of enchanted shield known as the shield of vigilance . The lance of Faerûn was a variety of lance that were crafted specifically for mounted Tormtar champions. The tooth of Torm was a type of magical dagger with a silver blade that allowed the wielder to see through invisibility .</p>
<h3>Spells</h3>
<p>Tormish clergy were granted a casting of the spell command to use once per day at their discretion. Spells associated with or often used by members of Torm's church included: alert vigil , bless weapon , silver dragonmail , golden dragonmail , Hand of Torm , bolt of glory , swordward , and wrath of Torm .</p>
<h3>Relics</h3>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Several valorous and benevolent knightly orders were considered among the allies of Torm's church, including the Knights of Imphras II , the Knights Kuldar of Barakmordin , and the Triadic knights , the latter two of which deified the Triad , the group of gods of which Torm was a member.</p>
<p>While not allies per se , the Tormish church appreciated the tenets of the Guardians of the Weave , specifically their efforts to negate the ill-effects of wild magic areas and dead-magic zones . They also held the gnome followers of Gaerdal Ironhand in high regard.</p>
<p>Despite the fact Torm and Helm remained close as divine powers, Torm's clergy maintained a less-than-amiable rivalry with the church of Helm . This relationship became much more strained during the mid–14 th century.</p>
<p>The church was considered a direct enemy of the Cult of the Dragon .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Dowager Lady, 726 DR , the church of Torm, along with those of Tyr and Ilmater , initiated the Triad Crusade . Holy warriors from all three faiths were dispatched to Impiltur to depose King Argosh the Scaled, who had previously seized the kingdom's throne.</p>
<h3>Time of Troubles</h3>
<p>When the gods of the Realms were cast down to Toril during the Time of Troubles in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Torm's avatar manifested within the city of Tantras in the Vast . By all appearances he was forced to remain within the local temple , held as a prisoner in his own holiest place of worship. In truth Torm allowed himself to be controlled in this manner for a short while, to understand the corruption that had spread among his faithful in the city. Using the miracle of Torm's appearance, the corrupt head-priest of Tantras' temple Dunn Tenwealth maneuvered himself into a greater position of power, designated the followers of other faiths as "unbelievers", and engaged in systematic oppression and torment over them.</p>
<p>When the colossal avatar of Bane marched upon the city that same year, intent on leveling it in search of the lost Tablet of Fate , Torm took action to protect his followers in his holy city. By means of the Ceremony of Power , Torm absorbed the life force of all his followers—both corrupt and true-hearted alike—and transformed his avatar into that of a lion -headed, humanoid champion equal in stature to the Bane's monstrosity. Torm and Bane's avatar's mortally wounded each other in the waters beyond the city, and hundreds of devout Tormish followers were dead. Many of them sacrificed their lives willingly, so that the great evil could be struck from the Realms.</p>
<p>For his service Torm was reinstated as a member of the Faerûnian pantheon. Some speculated that he was offered back his divinity in exchange for carrying the tenets of his faith unto death. Yet others believed that as a formal mortal native to the Prime that ascended to the power of a demigod , Torm could not be destroyed outright on Toril.</p>
<h3>Renaissance</h3>
<p>The church of Torm experienced a rebirth following this miraculous yet tragic series of events. Incensed by his followers' persecution of other goodly religions due to Dunn Tenwealth's misguidance, Torm dictated for his followers' failing the "debts" that became known as the Penance of Duty . Torm's faith soared in popularity and flourished across the breadth of Faerûn, while Torm himself regarded a divine hero and symbol of selflessness. Many children, called the Martyr's Progeny , left orphaned by sacrifices their parents made in Tantras were adopted by the church.</p>
<p>In the years that followed, Torm's clergy worked alongside Mystran priests to cleanse regions of dead and wild magic that were created during the Avatar Crisis. They utilized some of the most potent magic available to spellcasters at the time.</p>
<p>After Bane's return in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , many people turned to Torm's church for guidance and protection from the returned evil god and his cultish followers .</p>
<p>In the Year of Three Streams Blooded, 1384 DR , Cyric conspired the death of Tyr and affected Torm alongside the Loyal Fury's church.</p>
<h3>15 th Century</h3>
<p>In the time following the death of Tyr, some of Torm's clergy carried on traditions once associated with the Tyrran faith , even utilizing the same titles used within the church. Some orders of Tyrran paladins converted to the veneration of Torm, while others aligned their faiths with other gods.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, Torm's faith had grown exponentially more influential, and boasted the highest number of paladins among any group on all of Toril . Torm had ascended to the rank of greater power, and a divine domain bearing his name emerged, granting additional power to his followers and those of his allies.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>All manner of folks from across the Realms embraced Torm's faith and joined his church. These people often sought to better their own lives the world around them, and understood that often required resolute self-sacrifice.</p>
<p>The worship of Torm was notable among the Uthgardt barbarians , notably members of the Black Lion tribe .</p>
