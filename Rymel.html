<h2>History</h2>
<p>At the Rising Moon in Mirtul 6 of 1357 DR , after the death of his fellow Lynxal after being caught trying to pickpocket Ghondarrath , Rymel told, at the prompting of two of his companions, the tale of Verovan 's last race for the tavern's edification. When they finally retired to sleep, they found their belongings missing, stolen by Shandril , who wanted to replace Lynxal in their party. He took it with good humor, and was quick to accept Shandril.</p>
<p>The following morning, after a discussion in which Rymel had said more than anyone but Thail , Burlane changed the course for the entire company, heading for the Semberflow along the way to Myth Drannor . During the following day, he was against walking on while inside the mist, but was outvoted. They reached the river before evening; he took second watch alongside Ferostil.</p>
<p>The following morning on Mirtul 12 , they were attacked by a mysterious group of armored men, part of a mule train. Rymel fought in that fight, as did the entire, badly outnumbered company, until Elminster stopped the fighting with a spell to send their attackers fleeing. He was amongst those who brought the party's horses back after the fight.</p>
<p>In his final combat at the Gates of Doom when they were ambushed on Mirtul 20 , Rymel hurled a dagger at the wizard trying to slay them, and then struck him with a sword. Delg confirmed his death later that year.</p>
