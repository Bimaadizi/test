<p>An ixitxachitl ( pronounced : / ɪ k ˈ z ɪ t z ɑː tʃ ɪ t ʊl / ik-ZIT-za-chit-ul listen or : / ɪ k s ɪ t ˈ z ɑː tʃ ɪ t ɪ l / iks-it-ZATCH-i-til or : / ɪ ʃ ɪ t ˈ ʃ ɑː tʃ ɪ t l / ish-it-SHACH-itl ; pl : ixitxachitl or : ixitxachitls ) or ixixachitl , also known as a ' chitl , deep zealot , or demon ray , was an intelligent aquatic race resembling a manta ray that dwelled in the oceans of Toril .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Acording to mythos, Demogorgon created the manta rays when he was a primordial . The rays’ loyal descendants followed him into the Abyss and were corrupted, becoming the ixitxachitls. Weak by the standards of most other abyssal creatures, these fiendish rays dwell in protected areas of the Brine Flats and in oceans of the mortal world.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Ixitxachitls were highly intelligent, though were very single-minded and tended towards acts of evil .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Ixitxachitls preferred to ambush their prey in groups, lying in wait underneath the sea floor.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>The labyrinthine dens of ixitxachitls were typically dug–out from coral reefs with the help of slave labor. Their surrounding environment were often left devoid of all plant and wildlife.</p>
<p>Groups were led by the strongest among them through intimidation. This position was most often taken up by ixitxachitl clerics or a vampiric ixitxachitl .</p>
<h3>Religions</h3>
<p>All ixitxachitls revered some form of dark power. While some revered the demon lord Demogorgon and considered themselves to be his servants, those in the Sea of Fallen Stars worshiped Ilxendren , the patron god of their race.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Ixitxachitls were largely hated by other aquatic life due to their avaricious behaviors and practice of slavery. They were typically known to wage war for territory and feeding grounds against the sahuagins , locathahs , merfolk , and coastal human settlements. They had an intense rivalry with merrow over which of them were the superior servants of Demogorgon.</p>
