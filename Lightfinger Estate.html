<p>The Lightfinger Estate was a sprawling complex belonging to the Lightfinger family of Waterdeep in the late 15 th century DR . At its heart was the massive and luxurious Lightfinger Mansion .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Estate was a large and open space within the Sea Ward , with its own twisting streets and open courtyards adorned with fountains. The massive complex housed the Lightfinger family's servants and their families, while the Lightfingers themselves lived itself their opulently decorated and maze-like mansion at the center of the Estate.</p>
<p>The opulent and exquisite architecture of the Estate—along with an extensive art collection from all across Faerûn —was meant to showcase the family's immense wealth, and in particular, to flaunt it as a warning to any who might think to challenge their influence. Even the family's books and documents were said to be ornate.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The many open courtyards of the Estate were designed to be easy to defend, not only by Lightfinger guards but by a small army of shield guardians . In addition, fountains around the Estate concealed water weirds who also served to defend the area, with one particularly notable weird known as the Lightfinger Tempest .</p>
<p>The mansion at the heart of the Estate contained many secret rooms and passages, and was protected against prying eyes from both the Material and Outer Planes .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Estate was constructed using the considerable wealth acquired by Donovan Lightfinger during his career as a rogue , and it was still considered a recent addition to the Sea Ward in the late 15 th century DR when Lord Terrathy Lightfinger incurred the wrath of both the rakshasa Jurrgal and the pit fiend Kurgaloth , one of whom wanted to destroy the family and the other of whom wanted to force them to follow an infernal contract .</p>
<p>This soon led to the Estate being overrun by a wide array of dangerous monsters. The human guards were quickly driven into hiding, and the protective shield guardians were deactivated. Soon the chaos in the area led to the rise of rumors that Lord Terrathy Lightfinger was being derelict in his duty to keep the estate and surrounding Ward safe. Thus, Open Lord Laeral Silverhand to send a group of loyal adventurers to investigate the disturbance and protect the Sea Ward. This same disturbance drew the attention of Qholillaroon , an ulitharid who sent cranium rats to spy on the events at the Estate.</p>
<p>Once it became clear to the adventurers that the Lightfinger guards were missing, they reactivated the Estate's shield guardians, only to then have to contend with the fact that the guardians also considered them to be intruders on the Estate. The adventurers soon discovered that all of the Estate staff and servants had been replaced by doppelgangers , and that strangely, there was less fighting and conflict closer to the mansion than on the outskirts. Upon arriving at the mansion, the adventurers encountered devils , including the barbed devil Garvlin , the cambion Morothec , and the erinyes Tacherani . They ultimately learned of the many betrayals against Waterdeep committed by the Lightfinger family before driving off Jurrgal and banishing Kurgaloth back to Avernus .</p>
<p>As there were no signs of the family after the conflict, and given their many betrayals of Waterdeep, it was declared that any Lightfinger claim to their Estate would be forfeit.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Estate was home to the Lightfinger family, their guards and guardians, and their servants. However, by the late 15 th century DR, all of the servants had been replaced by doppelgangers .</p>
