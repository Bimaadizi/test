<p>Darwinn's Trading Post was a general store and provisions shop found in Feather Falls in the late 14 th century DR . The owner, Darwinn , set reasonable prices for his shop, having only a 10% markup.</p>
<p>In contrast to its modest services, Darwinn's also offered potions of healing and potions of flying for sale. His source for these magical items was unknown to the Dalesfolk of Feather Falls as Darwinn refused to share that particular piece of information.</p>
