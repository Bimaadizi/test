<p>Eloar was an eladrin noble and the Mistress of the Spire of Summer's Mist on the Watch on Forever's Edge , together with Dramvar .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>She wore elaborate, stylish black leather armor, and carried a rapier.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>During her fight with Taal , Eloar made use of short-range teleportations, a blinding effect alongside her rapier attack, and even became invisible for a brief period.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At a point in time equivalent to the Year of the Secret, 1396 DR , Eloar joined Dramvar in a trip to their neighboring spire, the Tower of Winter's Peace , where they sought to talk to Malyanna . Her castellan, Taal , informed them that her absence continued and that she was in the world rather than the Feywild ; they invoked the Articles of the Compact , requesting Taal provide access to her chambers, so that they may be examined for suspicious activity. Though Taal acquiesced, he ambushed and slew them shortly afterwards. He discarded their bodies over Forever's Edge later.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Taal replicated Dramvar's handwriting later, claiming that the two eladrin nobles he'd slain had decided to remain at Winter's Peace for a full tenday.</p>
