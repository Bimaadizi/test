<p>A longhorn was a type of Faerûnian flute that was commonly found in civilized regions, or in elven communities.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A Longhorn was considered to be a lyrical musical instrument. It was also very portable and easy to play, as well as elegant. This made the longhorn as popular as yartings among musicians.</p>
<p>Since longhorns were very sophisticated instruments, difficult to make, they could only be found in areas that held skilled artisans such as big cities and elven communities.</p>
<p>There were two types of longhorn: the common longhorn, whose range covered middle to upper register, and the soprano (or sopranino) longhorn, which had a very high and piercing tone, similar to the chirping of birds . Both were available for purchase through Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue .</p>
