<p>Daggers of impaling were a variety of daggers usable only by thieves that carried an enchantment that made extremely effective back-stabbing implements.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>In addition to carrying a +2 enchantment, when stabbed into the back of an opponent a dagger of impaling would deal far more grievous wound than normal and would become lodged within the open gashing wound. Whilst impaled, a dagger of impaling continued to cause harm to the victim's bodily health until removed. This property made them useful as a throwing weapon.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime around the 14 th century DR , a group of Ravenian adventurers came across the corpse of a human man that had been killed with a dagger of impaling by members of the To Clan .</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , daggers of impaling gained some popularity among unsavory elements of Waterdeep and inhabitants of Undermountain , including the recently resurfaced Shadow Thieves guild.</p>
