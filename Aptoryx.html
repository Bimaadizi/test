<p>Aptoryx was a venerable red dragon and proprietor of the Underdark Arena , who laired beneath Cormyr in the Deep Wastes during the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Aptoryx was utterly superior in demeanour, as most dragons were, and considered arena fights an intriguing and entertaining business. He dealt relatively fairly with gladiators within this scene, respecting the craft.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>In addition to the strength and power typical to adult dragons, Aptoryx was a capable conjurer , able to summon and deal with all kinds of planar beings.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the late 15 th century DR and the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar , Aptoryx became fascinated by the House Cay'Vorym gladiatorial operation at the Underdark Arena. Eventually Aptoryx decided he could do better than Cay'Vorym, and seized the arena. He filled it with fresh magma and replaced the drow and human fighters with fiery creatures, including many summoned planar beings, such as elementals and fiends .</p>
<p>His champions included the salamander Finnfaran , the night hag Scintilla , and the enormous magma brute , the Brimstone Archon . Those that fought well received a just reward of fame and treasure before being asked to leave. While more than pleased to sit back and watch the little ones kill each other, he was proud enough to be drawn into the arena himself by an ascendant contender, potentially resulting in his own death on the arena floor.</p>
