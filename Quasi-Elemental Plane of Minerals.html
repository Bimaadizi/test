<p>The Quasi-Elemental Plane of Minerals , or Quasi-Elemental Plane of Mineral , was the Inner Plane at the intersection of the Elemental Plane of Earth and the Positive Energy Plane . It was a place rich in gems and ore.</p>
<p>Traveling to the Plane of Gems was deadly perilous for all unprotected living beings, as they were transformed into stunningly beautiful crystals devoid of life and with very sharp edges that could easily injured creatures. Another great danger in this Plane was fossilization, which threatened to literally fossilize any creature not from the Plane of Minerals. Such unfortunate visitors were transformed either into simple stone (in which case they could be changed back with a stone to flesh spell) or, in about one case out of five, into mineralized statues of crystal, gold-veined granite, or gemlike stone (in which case only a wish spell could return them to life). Such 'gemmed' creatures, when returned to a plane with normal gravity, crumbled to dust — just like any gem from this plane.</p>
<h3>Creatures</h3>
<p>Creatures from this plane resembled exquisitely delicate, insect-like creatures, seamlessly blending the Prime Material they mimicked with a myriad of sharp angles and intricate insectoid traits.</p>
