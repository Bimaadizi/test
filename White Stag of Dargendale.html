<p>The White Stag of Dargendale was the white deer that became a sign of good luck for the locals of Dargendale and an elusive trophy for hunters and poachers sometime before 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The rare white deer, who was named White Stag of Dargendale, lived in the forests of a tiny rural community of Dargendale in the Dalelands . The cunning creature avoided poaches and their tracks for several decades, earning a superstitious belief among the locals that the White Stag was an omen of good luck. Eventually, a devious hunter named Worlges the Black crafted a trap that managed to capture the elusive deer. Proud of his accomplishment, Worlges did not want to simply mount the stag's head on his wall; instead, the hunter killed and stuffed the White Stag of Dargendale. He kept the resulting taxidermy in his private bedchambers. This desecration of a perceived giver of good luck angered Dargendale's pedantry. This outrage inspired a traveling druid to sneak into Worlges' chambers and temporarily animate the stuffed creature with the White Stag's spirit . That night the stag exacted his revenge on his murderer. The White Star relentlessly perforated the sleeping poacher with his sharp antlers, leaving the dead body filled with holes and covered with down feathers. Worlges' servants found the hunter dead in the morning while the stag stood motionless with bloodied antlers. It was a common joke among the locals that in the end, Worlges "got as good a stuffing and any man could."</p>
<p>By 1372 DR, the stuffed White Stag of Dargendale, feared cursed by some, was in possession of Torleth Mindulspeer and kept in his curio store, Torleth's Treasures in Gillian's Hill . If customers looked at the stag's antlers, they could still see traces of old blood.</p>
