<p>Mhaere Dryndilstann was a human cleric of Lathander and an innkeeper of the Yawning Portal in Waterdeep in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . She was the wife of the owner, the famed adventurer Durnan the Wanderer .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Mhaere was a devoted and strong-willed but quiet woman. She was kindly, alert, and lively. Mhaere's levelheaded competence was one of her greatest strengths.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was good looking with strong features, albeit not a striking beauty.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As a cleric, her hands were able to both heal and kill in battle. Among her spells , she had command , cure light wounds , flame blade , and hold person .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Mhaere managed the Yawning Portal inn with her husband Durnan. She was hard-working and brisk about her duties. While she picked up much gossip whilst working at the inn, she was not one to share and spread it.</p>
<p>Often, she also healed injured adventurers coming out of Undermountain . Despite Durnan's rules on paying a gold piece in order to be lifted out of the well, Mhaere would on occasion drop one down to those in dire need so they could pay, at least when Durnan's back was turned.</p>
<p>If trouble broke out at the inn, Durnan had a horn he would blow to summon the Red Sashes , his personal vigilante organization. If he was unavailable or incapacitated, then Mhaere and others would find it and use it.</p>
<p>As a sideline business, she sewed basic dresses, working smocks, and towels.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She was married to Durnan. Together they had a daughter, Tamsil Dryndilstann ; since Durnan had no surname, she took Mhaere's. Tamsil took closely after Mhaere. They also had two younger daughters. Mhaere was aware of her husband's status as a Masked Lord of Waterdeep , but did not discuss it with him.</p>
<p>She had an uncle in Neverwinter , who was also a priest of Lathander.</p>
<p>She achieved the rank of Helping Hand in the church of Lathander .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mhaere was born in Neverwinter and raised there by her uncle.</p>
<p>She became an adventurer, but later retired.</p>
<p>The murderer Amril Zoar used a gate to enter the Yawning Portal one morning fore-dawn in early Flamerule of the Year of the Harp, 1355 DR , doubtless seeking to slay Durnan. He rushed at young Tamsil but, quick-reacting, she threw the ewer of water she'd been carrying at him, before Mhaere snatched up the double-crossbow kept ready behind the bar and gave him both bolts. Amril retreated through his gate , dropping a silver Harper pin in the process. Durnan arrived moments later, vowing to find and end the man who'd threatened his family.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Mhaere commonly wore a ring of regeneration and typically had concealed about the common room two scrolls each of cure light wounds , cure moderate wounds , and neutralize poison , or other healing scrolls. In her younger days, she wielded a +2 flail and wore plate armor , which she kept stored in the wardrobe in her bedchamber. In the event of fighting in the inn, she was more likely to wield a handy club or mace . She typically wore a belt knife for work and eschewed jewelry .</p>
