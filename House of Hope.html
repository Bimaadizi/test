<p>During the Time of Troubles in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , the deity Torm resided at his temple in Tantras. Torm's zealous priests began persecuting followers of other faiths as "unbelievers", and the unlucky House of Hope was left with a dearth of material and spiritual resources.</p>

<p>Circa 1358 DR , the temple was led by High Priestess Lashaera Thindol , with five priests and eight lay-followers.</p>
