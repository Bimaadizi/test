<p>A healer's kit , also known as a healer's bag , was a set of of equipment used by medics to treat the injured.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The contents of these kits were kept in leather pouches . The contents themselves were splints, ointments, balms, and dressings. Healers' kits could stabilize those who had fallen in battle, though the kits could only be used ten times, as their contents were limited. Skilled physicians were able to make even greater uses of such kits, restoring the fallen so that they could fight again, and restoring their health even if they had not fallen.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>These kits were used in many places throughout Faerûn , even in Undermountain .</p>
