<p>Leeches were a species of segmented worms .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Leeches were slimy and had a slug-like appearance.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<h3>Biology</h3>
<p>Leeches were highly vulnerable to salt and the application of sufficient amounts could kill them.</p>
<p>Like many species of invertebrate, leeches had a set of ocelli in place of normal eyes. These were a group of light receptive cells that could register changes in light intensity, though not actual images. Because of this, giant leeches often reacted to changes in nearby light.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Leeches typically hid themselves within the mud or slime typical of their habitats, then waited to strike upon any warm-blooded creature that passed them by. Though sometimes feeding solitarily, they would sometimes group up into large swarms numbering up to two or five hundred members.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 14 th century DR , Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue was known to sell jars full of live leeches for 10 gp .</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, a barber in Silverymoon by the name of Jooge Nopsmoth charged patrons a single gold piece to have blood extracted by means of leeches. He collected these leeches from a disused well beneath his store.</p>
<h2>Sub-Species</h2>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>These creatures fed upon the blood of warm-blooded creatures.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Leeches were only known to be found in the waters of temperate swamps and marshes. In Faerûn , they were particularly known to inhabit the Vast Swamp , the Lake of Steam , and the jungle within the Cathedral of Emerald Scales . They were also quite prevalent in the marshes of High Moor .</p>
<p>Beyond Faerûn, they could be found in pools of water all throughout Chu' Yuan . During the summer season, swarms of them could be found in the lakes, rivers, and swamps of the Ama Basin . And in the Crowded Sea , they could be found on the island of Djinni's Claws .</p>
<p>Beyond the Prime Material plane , they could be found in the Para-Elemental Plane of Ooze and the Domains of Dread .</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>Many peoples in the Realms would turn to the use of leeches when traditional medicines didn't prove effective. This belief was so widespread that they had somewhat of a placebo effect. Some even claimed they could be used to cure lycanthropy , though this was blatantly false.</p>
