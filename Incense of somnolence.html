<p>Incense of somnolence was a non-magical drug-like incense made from a blend of powerful herbs . It could affect even creatures normally resistant or immune to magic , both arcane and divine .

In smaller dosages, or when a creature was weaned off its effects, the incense still had an effect, making the targets disorientated and confused.</p>
