<p>Grayban was a half-orcish bouncer who worked for Durnan , the proprietor of the Yawning Portal , in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Grayban was a huge intimidating half-orc with light brown hide and brown hair. He was clad in chainmail . Grayban's left arm was missing, yet it did not stop the half-orc from being an effective bouncer. His face often grimaced to intimidate possible delinquents and his Common was broken and simplistic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Kythorn of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Waterdeep â€“ the City of Splendors, became once again menaced by the drow from the mega-dungeon of Undermountain . The Masked Lords determined that the danger was coming from underneath the Yawning Portal, and Durnan, put out a call for adventurers willing to traverse the dungeon's depths and route the evil within.</p>
<p>Grayban was tasked guarding the tavern's entrance and making sure that the heroes who answered the call did not wander off before Durnan's offer was vocalized to the group. Grayban was present at the Yawning Portal's common room, when a squadron of drow assassins sent by "queen" Valsharess attacked. The dark elves slaughtered many of the gathered adventurers. Survivors chased the assassins down into the Undermountain, while those killed were resurrected by the city's clergy . Grayban survived and helped Durnan with the clean up, whilst the adventurer that would be known as the Slayer of Mephistopheles descended into Undermountain.</p>
