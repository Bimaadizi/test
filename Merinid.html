<p>Merinid was a drow patron of the Ust Natha tavern who shared tales with his patrons, around 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Merinid informed Gorion's Ward and his party that the first drow settlement was simple: being built from twigs and black grass taken from the surface. He mentioned that the first drow honored their matriarch by stealing a stone throne from the sahuagin . To their horror, when presenting the throne, its weight fell through the grass rafters and crushed the matriarch on the floor below. He, potentially mockingly, said that the lesson learned from this moral was not to stow thrones in grass houses.</p>
<p>Merinid was overheard by the zealous Lolth supporter, Tathlyn . He was exposed and Tathlyn asked how he could tell such a moronic lie about the history of the drow. The Lolth zealot then attacked him for the glory of his goddess. Before they engaged in a fight, Merinid commented that Lolth had no sense of humor, but Vhaeraun did.</p>
