<p>Shalima Dauntrael was a sorceress from Baldur's Gate , whose legend was passed down in the Dauntrael clan.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>She was said to have never married, but to seek to conceive a child; the man she ultimately went to was a marilith in disguise, and the child would slay her upon birth. In response, she sought every spell she could muster from a dozen mages (some given willingly, some not as much) to alter the nature of her child without slaying it. Her child, whom she named Hemtor , ultimately had only a few tanar'ri traits upon birth.</p>
