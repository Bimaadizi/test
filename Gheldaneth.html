<p>Gheldaneth was the second largest city in the nation of Mulhorand , as well as one of its sixteen preceptual governments. It would later come to be the only city in Mulhorand to survive the Spellplague after 1385 DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This city was situated in the Menesankh region of Mulhorand, the southern coast of the Alamber Sea , where the mouth of the River of Spears emptied.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gheldaneth was largely made up of urban sprawl and hosted a large port facility. Much of this was destroyed during the Spellplague's upheavel, with its grand buildings becoming buried in rubble, and would be replaced with new buildings.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Gheldaneth had a preceptual government, which ruled over both the city and the area at the mouth of the River of Spears. It was largely governed by the local clergy of the Church of Thoth . Its rulers in the 14 th century DR , as recommended to the vizier by the Thothian priesthood, were the Precept Derlaunt and the Divine Precept Tholaunt . The latter was an incarnation of Thoth and had the authority to overrule Derlaunt.</p>
<p>Seeing as Thoth was a god of knowledge, it was compulsory in Gheldaneth for all citizens to attend the city's university, even slaves.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The city imported various foods from the Great Vale , which arrived either by land or sea, as well as miscellaneous good from Unthalass that came through its port facility. Gheldaneth was also notably the primary source of magic items in Mulhorand.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the Spellplague, the city's population was greatly reduced. By 1479 DR , it had sworn fealty to High Imaskar and the Imaskarians stationed troops in the city to ensure its loyalty.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The city was home to many ethnic Mulhorandi who carried on many of their traditions. The city also housed many tieflings , descendants of slaves who made pacts with dark forces.</p>
