<p>The Phoenix clan was a ninja clan and an ally of the Goshukara clan in Nakamaru in Wa around 1357 DR .</p>
<p>Despite not being as efficient as the Hijo clan , the Phoenix were more obscure and secretive, not telling anyone the true name of their clan or the location of their headquarters. Their leader was a mysterious woman called the Serpent ; all other members of the clan had met her at least once but could not identify her.</p>
<p>Circa 1257 DR , the Phoenix decided to ally with the Goshukara to prosper, but their mutual ties were not strong. Their recruitment policy was usually to have an older member sponsor a promising young person, who then disappeared from public life and was trained under a new "father" until, after the so-called father's death, the initiate inherited his position.</p>
