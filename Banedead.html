<p>Banedead , also referred to as Claws of Xvim , Promised Ones or the Shriveled Dead of Bane , were a type of undead creatures that appeared in Faerûn for a brief time after the Time of Troubles . They were closely associated with the worship of the deity Bane and his church of followers .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Banedead appeared as decaying humanoids that were completely stripped of any appearance of natural life. After being risen, the corpse underwent a partial transformation befitting an undead servant of Bane. Their eyes glowed with malevolent red light, and one of their hands grew and twisted into a horrific claw.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>They were immune to spells and abilities that attempted to, hold them in place , put them to sleep , or charm them . They could not be swayed by illusion magic , mind-altering effects or harmed by any sort of poison . They had few weak points, and could shrug off hits that would destroy most other monsters.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>When a banedead's malformed claw struck an opponent it sapped away their sense of agility and finesse, until they were left completely paralyzed .</p>
<p>In battle, banedead were particularly dangerous relative to most other forms of undead because they retained much of their mortal intelligence. They always sought out holy champions as their first victims. While they preferred clerics and paladins above most others, the sight of Cyricists made them incensed. They tried to rend followers of the Dark Sun with intense fervor.</p>
<p>They could only be harmed by enchanted weapons.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Banedead were created by means of a unique ritual that could only be lead by a powerful priest of Bane or his divine son Iyachtu Xvim , performed upon one of those deity's holy sites. These rituals often involved large groups of the faithful. The priest would transform willing devotees into one of these terrifying undead monstrosities, often converting a dozen at a time.</p>
<p>Control of a banedead could be transferred from its creator to a wizard , typically a member of the Zhentarim . If banedead were turned by a rival or enemy cleric, the cleric or wizard who controlled them risked losing their power over the banedead.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was said that banedead wandered around Zhentil Keep following Bane's death following the Time of Troubles . They were believed to have been seeking out and slaying any follower who had strayed to another faith.</p>
<p>By the time of Bane's return in 1372 DR , banedead in service to the Zhentarim were active all across Faerûn , from Waterdeep to Thay , actively seeking out followers of Cyric . Fzoul Chembryl was said to have a dozens of banedead under his direct control.</p>
