<p>Shortly thereafter, their plan was uncovered by Steward Regis of Mithral Hall after he enchanted Nanfoodle with his ruby pendant . Shoudra defended themselves, saying that had they known that Mithral Hall was at war with the orc tribes, they would not have attempted to poison the ore.

<p>Soon after, at the battle of Mithral Hall's eastern gates, Shoudra was hoisted into the air by King Obould Many-Arrows and sliced in half with his flaming greatsword.</p>
