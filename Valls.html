<p>Valls was a city in Damara and the capital of the Duchy of Arcata .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It was situated in the dusty plains of central Arcata—in western Damara—along a tributary to the Beaumaris River at the western end of the King's Road .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Given its location, Valls was a bustling center for trade out of western Damara. Mercenary groups for hire were easy to find in the city, and equipment for adventurers and mercenary groups was readily available, even in bulk.</p>
<h2>Defense</h2>
<p>The town was surrounded by a wall with three gates and twelve towers. It was defended by the Ducal Guard .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the death of King Virdin at the Battle of Goliad in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Valls was overrun by refugees moving south to escape the invaders of Vaasa . The inns were overflowing, resulting in many people sleeping in barns or outside the walls in camps, where they were vulnerable to attacks by bandits or wild wolves , worgs , or tigers . There was little wealth left in the town and, in response, refugees begged on the streets and merchants increased their prices.</p>
<p>Shortly after, the town was visited by the Circus of Doctor Trundles . At a parade through the town, a bulette escaped and tore up the cages of the other circus monsters. After a tumult, where a few people were killed, all monsters except the bulette, were recaptured.</p>
<p>The next year, after hearing about the rejuvenation of the Barony of Bloodstone and the wealth of Bloodstone Mines , Arcta's Duke William the Lazy plotted to invade and seize the mines for himself. Valls was the staging point for his troops, who marched north along the old King's Road and thus sparked the Bloodstone Wars . Arcata would be humiliated in the subsequent battle, and Duke William was only permitted to continue ruling the city and his duchy at the whim of the Baron of Bloodstone, Gareth Dragonsbane . He was soon understood to be merely a figurehead.</p>
<p>With the end of the Bloodstone Wars later that year, the whole town seemed to be holding its breath to see the outcome of the contest for the Damaran throne between Baron Gareth Dragonsbane of Bloodstone and Baron Dimian Ree of Morov . Inspired by Gareth's actions in the Bloodstone Wars—notably the famous " Gareth's Gamble "—the people of Valls became strong supporters of his bid for the kingship. It was said that the Ducal Guard in the city was more loyal to Gareth than to William.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>The town had ten inns and a tavern. There was a large central plaza, and a fairground was located just outside the city walls to the southwest.</p>
