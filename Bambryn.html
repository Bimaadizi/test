<p>Bambryn was a village in the Vast , lying on the crossroads of the Hlintar Ride , between Hlintar and Dark Hollow , and the Long Reach , between Sendrin and Orlimmin .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the early Time of Glorious Fools , after humans first settled the central Vast in the mid–7 th century DR , the vengeful bandit Iljack of the Black Blade plagued the central Vast. He made Bambryn his base of operations.</p>
<p>Bambryn was a wealthy village by the mid-to-late 14.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bambryn was a way-village marked by its rural beauty and common hedgerows. There were many horse -ranches and farms. There were manor houses belonging to the wealthy merchants and adventurers who settled there; these houses were protected by hired guards and war- dogs .</p>
<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>Thanks to its proximity to local trade-routes, Bambryn was popular with merchants and adventurers, particularly those who'd been successful but not fully retired. It was a wealthy village, but this was largely invested in agriculture. Bambryn produced quality horses and luxury crops, like flowers , truffles , and other exotic fungi . These plants were kept fresh with cantrips prior to export.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Iljack of the Black Blade was widely thought to have hidden his loot somewhere in Bambryn, but it was never located. Once, a tree fell over in a storm, revealing a stone marked with a black sword buried beneath. However, there was no treasure underneath, just another stone carrying the message "Moved it all. See me for your share." and another black sword symbol.</p>
