<p>Nimrod of Nump was a mage of, it's presumed, Nump in the Misbegotten Realms . He was renowned as the greatest schlemiel of that world.</p>
<h2>Home</h2>
<p>He once had a lair in the aptly named Verdant Forest, later known less aptly as the Verdant Desert. These two facts seem closely related.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Although possessed of some faint flickers of magical talent, Nimrod was quite lacking in the aspects of management, application, and forethought. He was in fact a prolific inventor of magical spells and magical items and magical mistakes. His proudest (others might say worst) achievement was the cylindrical scroll .</p>
<p>Whilst trying to enhance the basic spell erase , Nimrod seems to have made his final mistake and erased not only it, but himself too.</p>
<h3>Legacy</h3>
<p>After Nimrod's timely expiry, a number of his cylindrical scrolls remained lost, or maybe dumped, in various dungeons of the Misbegotten Realms and were a bane on unwary adventurers. His magical items, similarly, lay lost in certain treasure hoards and vaults, usually as a defence mechanism against such adventurers.</p>
<p>Some of the cylindrical scrolls came into the possession of several adventuring companies and those who survived chose to collect them together and secure them safely away from the world. The wizard Elkwhisker later discovered this trove of cylindrical scrolls , hidden in a dumpster behind the House of Out in the Kingdom of Slumdudgeon. Who knows how they got there.</p>
<p>Circa 1989 CE, Elkwhisker visited Earth and put occasional Dragon magazine contributor John M. Maxstadt to sleep telling him about Nimrod of Nump.</p>
<h2>Inventions</h2>
<h3>Cylindrical Scrolls</h3>
<p>Nimrod of Nump's cylindrical scroll was a unique form of magical scroll where the top joined seamlessly to the bottom, forming a continuous tube of parchment. An amazing side-effect, likely unintentional, was that spells inscribed on the scroll stayed there forever, no matter how often they were cast or copied. A terrible side-effect was that spells inscribed on the scroll stayed there forever, no matter how often they were cast or copied. This was because Nimrod neglected to include descriptions of spell effects and the circular nature of the scroll joined one spell to another, so casting them was liable to be catastrophic.</p>
<h3>Spells</h3>
<p>For some reason, Elkwhisker recorded the following of Nimrod cylindrical scrolls and the spells thereon:</p>
<h3>More Magical Items!</h3>
<p>Some of Nimrod of Nump's other magical items were as follows:</p>
<p>All were valued at absolutely no more than 6 gp , unless the seller just paid one to take them away.</p>
