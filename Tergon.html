<p>Tergon was a Neverwintan hero.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 10 th century DR , the Forge of Spells was used to create various magical items. Tergon was to be made a breastplate that could resist the breath of dragons and provide extra protection against any incoming hits. The human mages of the mine summoned a spectator to watch over the magical creations. However, in 951 DR , a savage group of orcs invaded the area, slaying the mages and others in the mines. Nothing else was known about the history of Tergon.</p>
<p>Circa 1491 DR , his enchanted breastplate was still guarded by the same spectator.</p>
