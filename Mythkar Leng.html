<p>Mythkar Leng was a male human cleric of first Bane and later Cyric in the late 1350s and 1360s DR . He was a member of the Zhentarim , leading their activities in northwest Faerûn , and an advisor to Lord Geildarr Ithym of Llorkh in the Savage Frontier .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Mythkar Leng was the local leader of the Zhentarim in northwest Faerûn, a position he held by 1358 DR and through to at least 1370 DR . His goal was to dominate trade routes across the North and up and down the Sword Coast North . To this end, the town of Llorkh was selected as the Zhentarim's foothold in the North, thanks to its distance from the rival powers of Silverymoon and Waterdeep . The Zhentarim took over Llorkh shortly before 1357 DR , making it their base and Mythkar's Zhentarim thus achieved a monopoly on trade between Llorkh and Loudwater . They also set up a base in Secomber and placed agents in strategic positions in Triboar , Waterdeep, Yartar , and Zundbridge .</p>
<p>Ostensibly, he served as an advisor to Lord Geildarr of Llorkh.</p>
<p>Mythkar also managed a shrine dedicated to Bane in Llorkh. However, by 1367 DR , having converted from the worship of the deceased god Bane, Mythkar was high priest of a full-fledged temple to Cyric called the Dark Sun in the town.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>In truth, Geildarr was a lesser-ranked member of the Zhentarim, whom Mythkar kept in line and pursuing the Zhentarim's plans for the North. In this, he was aided by the beholder Rakaxalorth .</p>
<p>Mythkar was allied with the Beast Lord of Dekanter . He was opposed in his efforts to dominate the region by the Harpers and the Lords' Alliance .</p>
