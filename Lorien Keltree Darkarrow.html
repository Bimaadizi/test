<p>Sir Lorien Keltree Darkarrow was a prominent swashbuckling adventurer , knight , mage , self-professed bard , and later lord of the city of Ravens Bluff in the Vast in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lorien was originally born a human , but later in his adventuring career died and was reincarnated as a moon elf . As a moon elf he stood 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall and weighed around 163 lb (73.9 kg). He looked to be 25 in human years, had light Gray hair with hints of silver, and silver specked green eyes.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>In his early life Lorien was charismatic, social, and fun loving individual. As teenager he showed no care for his seeming family responsibilities and his family's efforts to become part of the Ravens Bluff nobility. He freely spent his money and enjoyed games of chance.</p>
<p>As an adult he notably possessed a genius-level intellect. And as a swashbuckling adventurer, enjoyed toying with his enemies. However, he was also a very humble man, preferring not to be addressed by his titles, for they reminded him of his parents and their fixation on social strata. It was only the responsibilities that those titles carried that he cared about. Lorien was also noted for valuing his privacy and thus would remain silent regarding any of the many rumors that surrounded him.</p>
<p>Following his own death and then the death of his wife, Lorien's mind took a dramatically solemn and stern turn, at last feeling a weight of responsibility. He began acting quick and decisely, striking without compassion, dead set on protecting those who could not protect themselves. However, eventually Sir Lorien would return to his simple personage of bardic swashbuckler, trying to have fun, enjoy time with his friends, spreading good cheer among his fellow knights.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>In terms of arcane magic , Lorien's repertoire of known spells included anti-magic shell , cone of cold , contingency , detect invisibility detect magic , dimension door , dispel magic , ESP , fire shield , fly , haste , lightning bolt , Lorien’s seen servant , magic missile , phantasmal force and improved phantasmal force , polymorph self , proof against teleportation , protection from paralysis , safeguarding , slow , stoneskin , strength , teleport , thunderlance , wall of force , and web .</p>
<p>In terms of weaponry, this swashbuckler was proficient in the use of horseman's maces , longbows , longswords , main-gauches , rapiers , sabers , and stilettos . From his time at a bardic school, he was skilled in dancing, singing, and playing the harp and lute . He also had some expertise in alchemy , engineering , and using ropes .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Sir Lorien's repertoire of magic items included bracers of blinding strike , a circlet of stars , clothing of cleanliness , a medallion of spell exchange , a rod of absorption , a rope of climbing , a sash of fire resistance , a shortsword of the Traveller , a vest of holding , a wineglass of levitation , and the famous holy sword the moon of Selûne .</p>
<p>He spent his early years in Ravens Bluff living at the Seven Tiger Inn , having his own private parlor there. He went on to own a sprawling estate in Ravens Bluff by the name of Darksilver House , situated in the Mortonbrace neighborhood of the city's Uptown District , close to the city's Temple of Selûne and Temple of Sune .</p>
<p>He later moved away from Ravens Bluff to Fort Thoden , which he later renamed Darkarrow Keep, to fulfill his duties as Baron of Mossbridges . When Lorien moved to the fort he sold his estate to Lord Silver Fox , but retained ownership over part of the manor for himself on the occasions when he was in the city. He also maintained residences in a number of different locations across the city.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>In his gambling youth Sir Lorien was a common visitor of the House of Thud . In terms of business ventures, Lorien was one of the owners of Potions, Lotions, & Notions , a shop that at one point was the largest magic trader in Ravens Bluff, and he financed the construction of the Silvermoon Playhouse next to his estate. Following its construction he continued to finance the theater and not charge its troupe any rent.</p>
<p>Sir Lorien was most prominently known for being part of the Knights of the Golden Rooster , to which he was a member of for several years and cared deeply for upholding its reputation. Following the destruction of their headquarters, the Roost , Lorien was made the Acting Knight Commander of the Golden Roosters for a period of six months whilst they looked for a suitable new leader. Not long after that rise in authority, Mayor Amber Lynn Thoden had him granted a position in the prestigious Knights of the Raven , personally requesting he take the oaths of the Ravens. And though he was found eligible by the Knights Council , the Mayor had circumvented the established process of indoctrination and procedures for promoting someone.</p>
<p>Beyond the Ravenian knighthoods, was a founding member of the Society of the Grand Gauche , a swashbuckling organization. He was also a member of the Harpers , the city's Bard's Guild , the city's Wizards Guild , and the Ravens Bluff Irregulars . In terms of deities , Lorien showed particular reverence towards Tymora , Selûne , and Sune .</p>
<p>After the Three Women War, Lorien was bestowed the title of Baron of Mossbridges by the Lord Mayor, along with a title to the lands and estates of Fort Thoden. By the late 14 th century DR, Lorien was seldom seen adventuring, having devoted himself to the role of Baron of Mossbridges. As Baron he was known for taking great care of both his servants and the townsfolk of Mossbridges. After a few years he would retire from his role as Baron, having decided to move to the island city-state of Orlumbor .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Beginning in Year of the Wyvern, 1363 DR , he had an elderly man by the name of Samuel as his personal attendant. He was also good friends with Analaina Blessing , Sir Beryl of the Wizards Guild, Aric Moonstone , a number of bardic masters. And had an amicable relationship with Anabelle , the captain of the armed forces of Mossbridges and heir to his title.</p>
<p>For a time Lorien was married to High Moonmistress Mirial Moonsilver , a high ranking priestess of Selûne. They first met sometime between 1366 - 1370 DR , at the wedding of Lord Andon . He had escorted her to the event alongside Aric Moonstone to perform. The two later wed sometime during that period. Eventually, during his time as Baron of Mossbridges, Lorien managed to find a new love and would spend weeks far away from Ravens Bluff visiting her on the island of Orlumbor, on and off, for over three years. His new love was none other than the island's Sea Witch , to whom he had a daughter that they named Lómelindë .</p>
<p>Over the course of his career he had many encounters with the Harpers Melissa Eldarin and Patch .</p>
<p>While a member of the Golden Roosters he led to Peter Peckson being kicked out of the order, who then became obsessed with getting revenge on the order by discrediting both it and its members.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Lorien first came to prominence in Ravens Bluff with his founding of the Society of the Grand Gauche. Over time many bardic songs would be written about him and a slew of people would even name their children after him. Depending upon whom one asked, he was considered to be either a "famous" or "infamous" individual, especially during the period following his wife's death whe he turned to alcoholism, he was regarded as more of an "infamous" individual.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lorien was born to a land owning family in Ravens Bluff, the fifth son of Lord Darkarrow . Over time his father grew exasperated with his debonair attitude and had him sent away to a school of bardic training. It was unknown if Lorien ever finished his education, but over the years he would repeatedly claim to be a bard.</p>
<p>Before eschewing the blade and finding his calling in arcane magic, Lorien purchased the legendary blade Moon of Selûne .</p>
<p>From 1358 to 1363 DR , Lorien lived at the Seven Tiger Inn, becoming proprietor Arthur Wilde 's best paying customer. Sometime in 1363 DR, he left the city for a few weeks with fellow adventurer Benzoate Glycol to hunt down a large, rogue mammoth called Thunder Death . He left his personal attendant Samuel behind in Ravens Bluff, paying the man to maintain his personal affairs while he was away. Their overall journey took them three weeks back and forth, traveling far south of Dragon Falls and the Fire River .</p>
<p>Circa 1367 DR , during the winter Lorien decided to join the Knights of the Golden Rooster. He was not motivated by any desire to serve Ravens Bluff, but rather was interested in restoring the knighthood's prominence. Not long after joining he entered into a grand tournament with other knights and won the tournament.</p>
<p>The following summer, Circa 1368 DR , he led a movement, endorsed by the Knight's Council, to both expel several members of the Knights of the Golden Rooster who had been responsible for tarnishing the Order's reputation and change its bylaws so as to prevent the induction of those without merit. Around that same time, the local Temple of Lathander was in need of testing the discreteness of potential holy sword recipients and Sir Lorien agreed to take part in the temple's ceremony.</p>
<p>Some of the individuals stripped of their knighthood as a result of Sir Lorien's reformist efforts were so enraged by the disgrace that they assassinated him. Not long after, he would be reincarnated by the Church of Selune , returning to life as a moon elf. Those who were responsible for his murder were later believed to have been brought to justice.</p>
<p>Several tendays before the Marpenoth , 1368 DR, issue of the Ravens Bluff Trumpeter broadsheet was published, Lorien Darkarrow participated in the grand Adventurer Games during that year's Founders Day Celebration , hosted by Lady Lauren De Villars . Lorien Darkarrow overall won second place, being crowned the City Champion, and was also the winner of the fencing competition.</p>
<p>For the following year, Sir Lorien rarely spent time arond the Roost.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Belanor Fenmarel was appointed Deputy Mayor in the absence of the city's prior Deputy Mayor, Howard Holiday . His appointment was formally announced during that year's Winter Festival , being introduced by Sir Lorien, who at that time was the most junior member of the Golden Roosters. Later that day a wedding ceremony was held between Lord Charles Frederik La Verne Blacktree IV and Lady Katharine Marie Moorland . The ceremony was interrupted by a Zhentarim attack on the city. In the midst of the chaotic Zhent battlefield, Lorien later approached Lord Blacktree and challenged him to a duel.</p>
<h3>Three Women War Period</h3>
<p>In the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , on Eleint 21 , the day of the holiday Remembrance Day , a group of Talassans assaulted the city's Temple of Selûne with the explicit purpose of assassinating High Moonmistress Mirial, or more ambitiously the destruction of the temple itself before sundown. The last anyone saw of Mirial during the conflict was atop the temple roof, battling Talassans. When her body was never recovered during the efforts to dig out the upper floors in search of survivors she was deemed dead at the hands of Thunderhips , the leader of the attackers.</p>
<p>Sir Lorien took the death of his wife hard. He began distancing himself from the public eye and frequently drinking.</p>
<p>Later during the war he attended the wedding of the ranger Landros to the gypsy princess Lark . While at the proceedings he was seen to be quite intoxicated. This was reported on in the Trumpeter by reporter Jacinth Moonspring , who in the same article would claim to have overheard him speaking to another Selunite priestess, Silver of Selune , about his role in recent warehouse fires.</p>
<p>The City Watch would go on to open an investigation into the swashbuckler. Socialite Analaina Blessing and the drow Dusk both participated in an active investigation of Sir Lorien, interviewing a number of suspects. During this Analaina was stabbed in the back by a dagger , but was later revived from the dead. Dusk particularly made an impression on Lady Amber Lynn Thoden, who gifted her a ruby red magical sword for her perseverance in the investigation. Months later, Sir Lorien was arrested outside one of the city's courthouses and it came to light that someone had been impersonating him.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to Lorien Darkarrow, during that year's annual Ravens Bluff Fair the Ravenian adventuring community started a grass-roots effort through the business Potions, Lotions & Notions to get Sir Lorien elected as the new mayor. This support was quite vocal at times, with even a number of members of the Wizard's Guild allegedly in support of him, though ultimately it was not enough for Sir Lorien to take the mayoral office. He ran strongly in third place in the election, but after Charles Oliver O'Kane transferred his votes to Lord Blacktree, Lord Lorien's votes were quickly added to Lady Amber's, providing the difference needed for her to win. One of many shortcomings for the knight was that is religious commitments were a mystery. And due to Sir Lorien being unaware that he was event a candidate, the knight was often sighted donating to the rival campaigns.</p>
<p>After the election and in the midst of the Fair's Swashbuckler's Challenge, reporter Tomaldi Everspring tried to ask Sir Lorien to comment on his recent criminal accusations and loss in the election for the Trumpeter . To the election, Sir Lorien responded with surprise, thinking that Tomaldi was joking with him. In regards to his impersonation by a criminal, he responded, "I don't worry about it too much, it just seems to happen. At the wrong place at the right time, that seems to be the life of a swashbuckler. By the way..." before jumping back into the fray of the challenge.</p>
<h3>Post-War Period</h3>
<p>At the end of the Three Women War, Lorien Darkarrow was one of fifteen adventurers ennobled by newly-elected Mayor Amber Thoden in recognition to their services to the City of Ravens, raising them to the position of Ford Lord. She gifted Lorien the title of Baron of Mossbridges, along with a title to the lands and estates of Fort Thoden. Lorien later committed to his role as Baron of Mossbridges by moving to his fort and selling his old estate to Lord Silver Fox.</p>
<p>Not that long after, a Red Wizard of Thay attempted to travel back in time to conquer Ravens Bluff, but his chronomantic effect went awry and created a time distortion, stretching his soul over the city across 500 years of history. This consequently warped the timeline of the city, making all of its inhabitants more or less lawful evil . A group of adventurers that were unaffected by the timeline shift, with the invaluable aid of the wizard Carrague , managed to recreate the experiment and in the process sacrifice their very existences in order to save the city. Those who sacrificed their lives included Aven Elonis , Charles Oliver O'Kane, Elijah of Eldath , Silver of Selune, and many more. However, their existences were not truly erased, but rather trapped within time a time paradox, suffering for over 500 years in battle against the Red Wizard.</p>
<p>Sir Lorien Darkarrow researched and traveled extensively to discover and a means of rescuing them. He talked with Aven Elonis, one the only victims to make it back to the present day, and received a visit from Elminster of Shadowdale . Elminster advised Lorien on a ritual he could perform to rescue the others from the time paradox, whilst also securing Ravens Bluff's past. He sent out a number of his servants to find two groups of adventurers worthy of aiding him. The first were to gather components for his ritual, whilst the would be sent on quick journeys through time. They would be sent to four distinct moments in history to gather historical foci. With enough of these foci Lorien could focus the history of the Vast, solidifying Ravens Bluff's history, and release the spirits of those trapped in time.</p>
<p>The ritual proved a partial success and the events reported on in the Trumpeter a week later. At the time still receiving clerical assistance for injuries suffered after the ritual, Sir Lorien provided this comment to the broadsheet,</p>
<p>Later a terrorist group by the name of the Circle of Four destroyed the Roost, headquarters of the Knights of the Golden Rooster, killing many of its members in the process. That same day, Sir Lorien and many other prominent members of Ravenian society were kidnapped by the Circle of Four and imprisoned in a cloud jail high above the sky, a structure that Circle member Mortimer Lightfoot had created with the spells cloud shape and solid cloud . Following his eventual rescue from the Circle, Sir Lorien was asked to take on the position of Acting Knight Commander of the Golden Roosters. He agreed to fulfill that role for the next six months whilst the knighthood determined their new leader. He also pledged to personally oversee the Roost's reconstruction, promising that it would have the grandest ballroom in all of Ravens Bluff.</p>
<p>Nearly a full year after the Three Women War had ended, Ravenian forces found and sacked a fortress near Tantras belonging to who they believed to be Myrkyssa Jelan , the woman responsible for the war. Initially dying in the effort to capture her, the alleged Myrkyssa was resurrected and brought back to Ravens Bluff she was brought back to the city and to stand in public trial before thousands during the Winter Festival. During a recess in the trial, Lady Mayor Thoden announced to the crowd that in a private ceremony Sir Lorien had taken his oaths necessary to be knighted a member of the Knights of the Raven, having personally requested him to do so. Myrkyssa was ultimately found guilty and publicly executed by Sir Lorien.</p>
<p>Sir Lorien later checked with the Knights Council himself to be certain he was eligible for membership in the Knights of the Raven, to which they concurred. However, other members of that knighthood complained that Lady Mayor Thoden had circumnavigated traditional procedure. This eventually lead the Mayor to announce that a public ceremony for Sir Lorien's indoctrination into the order would be planned for later that same year.</p>
<p>Even after being granted membership in the Knights of the Raven, Sir Lorien remained firm on his promises to oversee the Roost's reconstruction, wanting the new headquarters to serve as a symbol for all new Golden Roosters, as well as his promise to command the knighthood until a replacement could be appointed, for he was very concerned of the order being viewed as "weak" and wanted to renew the public's respect. The order planned to have a "Rooster Call" that summer to vote on the matter of Knight Commander. In the interim he contacted Lady Devillars and a number of the local temples to help with fund-raising for the Roost's reconstruction. This would culminate in a charity ball, as well as a number of charity events at the city's temples of Sune, Lliira and Sharess .</p>
<p>Much of this was divulged to the public, after having moved to Mossbridges, in an interview with Jacinth Moonspring for the Trumpeter . In that interview Jacinth particularly highlighted Lorien's role as a "bachelor", tried to pry into his secret love life, and asked who he was taking to the charity ball. However, Sir Lorien summarily shot down these efforts to pry into his personal life, stated that the woman he was bringing to the charity ball wasn’t a local. He also rejected the notion that he had any plans of marrying Anabelle, the captain of the armed forces of Mossbridges, but praised her competency and noted she would serve Ravens Bluff well as his successor should he ever fall.</p>
<p>A month later, Lorien announced that any Golden Rooster interested in becoming the new Knight Commander would have to write a 300 words or less treatise detailing what they’d do if given the position. The ten best treatises would be read aloud at a gathering of Golden Roosters, at that year's Summer Festival , after which the attending knights would cast their votes for the new Knight Commander.</p>
<p>At some point, the city of Ravens Bluff discovered an artifact called the Heart of Bane and handed it to Baron Darkarrow to study. This lead to concern and rumors from outsiders that the artifact would inevitably corrupt the people of Mossbridges. A full two score of tanar'ri would assault the small coastal town, seeking to claim the Heart of Bane . With advice taken from the Dean of Extra-Planar Research, Simon Regulus , the people were prepared for such an attack and warned by magical alarms. The people of Mossbridges quickly took shelter in specially built structures as the city's defenders engaged the demons . Baron Darkarrow would not give reporters for the Trumpeter specifics on the engagement with the tanar'ri, but a merchant not far from Mossbridges would report having witnessed fire and lightning fill the sky. Four defenders died in the conflict. Three managed to be raised from the dead by local priests, whilst the fourth had to be shuttled off to Ravens Bluff for a resurrection .</p>
<p>When informed that the Heart of Bane was likely the reason for the tanar'ri assault, Baron Darkarrow would comment to the Ravens Bluff Trumpeter ,</p>
<p>Around that same time, Darkarrow Keep was being entirely redone and redecorated, with over 50 artisans and merchants crowded about for a laborious period of two tendays.</p>
<p>Tanar'ri would later rain down another attack upon Mossbridges, centered upon Lorien Darkarrow's estates. Whilst the estates did suffer damage from the attack, the town's defenses still held. A total of fifteen people were killed by the tanar'ri assault, though only few travelers outside of Mossbridges proper suffered injuries. Of these fifteen victims, five were managed to be raised from the dead by the local Temple of Lathander. In response to these events Lorien put in request to Ravens Bluff's Clerical Circle for priests willing to reside in Mossbridges, supporting a local temple and its growing community. Sir Lorien was also mindful of assuaging the concerns of adventurer priests by assuring that those who took up the offer would still have plenty of time for adventuring.</p>
<p>Sometime after the Heart of Bane was destroyed, Baron Darkarrow traveled west to the Sword Coast with a company of several adventurers from Mossbridges and the majority of his men at arms to provide aid to an ally on Orlumbor in their fight against pirates.</p>
<p>In Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Aric Moonstone, then one of the new High Priests of the Moonflame, went to his old friend Lorien after a magical effect caused his sex to change . Aric, going by the alias Aleesia, asked Lorien to create a simulacrum of her old self so that none would suspect Aleesia and Aric were the same person.</p>
<p>That same year, Mossbridges held its First Annual Year-End Festival , a weekend gala on Baron Darkarrow's estates centered around viticulture. Baron Darkarrow sent out formal letters of invitation, with gold embossed lettering, to hundreds of Ravens Bluff's finest. Many of those invited were lords and ladies, as well as adventurers, bards, entertainers, and merchants. Enclosed with each invitation was a small personal message from the Baron that read, "I hope you will be able to attend, it is my way of thanking all the adventurers of Ravens Bluff in my own way. Check in with Lady Anabelle when you arrive, there might be information she can give you regarding the celebration. See you there. Lorien." He also asked the Knights of the Golden Rooster to keep an eye on the festival, to which they sent senior knight Restrel Massimore as a representative.</p>
<p>When the party was in its final stages of preparation, Baron Darkarrow was called away by the Harpers on an important issue. He assured Captain Anabelle that he would be back before the start of the festival, or at least before the grand presentation. In his absence, she was to take control of the festival. To a group of adventurers that the Baron had briefed her on, she delegated a number of last minute social issues for the gala that the Baron had yet to address, namely the baking contest and wine judging. Neither was a trifling matter, for in both cases a contract with Mossbridges was on the line. Whoever won these judgings would become the signature pastry and wine of Mossbridges for the next twenty years and become the only wine allowed for sale in the town.</p>
<p>Amongst the adventurers, any knights or squires of the Golden Rooster were made to report to Sir Restrel at the estate's Rose Garden for an additional briefing. The knight told them to follow what the Baron called ABC. A stood for "Awareness", meaning the knight should remain alert of what's going on and prevent anything from occurring that could ruin the day. B stood for "Beauty", meaning they should make certain everyone remains looking their best. And finally C stood for "Care", meaning to take care that an injury did not befall anyone at the festival.</p>
<p>A bardic troupe seeking vengeance against both the people of Mossbridges and Ravens Bluff infiltrated the celebration, pretending to be hired by the Baron as entertainment, the four bards hiding amongst the festival's 26 other entertainers. This bardic troupe sabotaged the baking contest by poisoning the blueberry turnovers of Albert of Mossbridges and using an unseen servant to smash Boseth of Gull Isle 's custard filled coconut cake as it was cut into. This made it seem as though the cake had exploded and covered the crowd in cake and custard alike. At the wine tasting event, before the adventurers could arrive someone impersonating Baron Darkarrow had gotten there first and selected Jurmin Slissin of Waterdeep as the winner. The distraught merchants would recount that Jurmin's was only the second wine he tried and afterwards he caring not to try the eight remaining vintners. Giving chase to the imposter, the adventurers found him to be a greater doppelganger that Jurmin had hired to rig the event in his favor.</p>
<p>As Lady Anabelle took to the stage that evening with a weak smile, prepared to formally begin the festivities and announce the winners of the contests, a merry sword wielding Baron Darkarrow appeared next to her, having returned from his Harpers excursion. To the crowd he looked merely tired, but in actuality was quite wounded and using illusions from his repertoire of magical items to conceal that fact. Upon his opportune arrival the Baron proclaimed, "Well I see I am not too late. Sorry I took so long. You know those dragons, never can keep them waiting too long," and the crowd bursted into laughter.</p>
<p>Baron Darkarrow took the list of contest winners from Lady Anabelle and began to read it aloud himself, but then a loud twang rang out from a nearby group of bards. The vengeful troupe had cast chaos on at least thirty members of the crowd, causing a brawl to break out. A Red Wizard named Vortex , who had infiltrated the festival by impersonating the Mulman vintner Cartier with polymorph self , took advantage of this distraction to strike at the Baron himself. Unfortunately for Lorien Darkarrow, he had used up his allotment of spells prior to returning, but with the aid of the adventurers managed to overcome the attempt on his life.</p>
<p>With the dust of assassination attempts finally settled, Baron Darkarrow took to the stage once more with a smile. He thanked everyone present for the many great years he had as an adventurer, before declaring that the opening of this festival was to be his last act as Baron – he was stepping down from his position as Baron of Mossbridges and a Fort Lord of the city of Ravens Bluff to move west and settle full time in Orlumbor, though would go without mentioning that he was doing so to be with his lover, the Sea Witch of Orlumbor. He then announced that servants would be bringing gifts to many of those in attendance and lamented that he didn't have gifts for everyone as he was not skilled enough a wizard to cast the wish spell, musing that such a feat might take him a few more decades.</p>
<p>Holding up a glass of wine, Baron Darkarrow commented on the state of Mossbridges as being in its prime and his confidence that his successor, Lady Anabelle, would do a fine job managing the barony. And if he was ever needed, he had gifted Anabelle a message ring . As the stage cleared for many of the Baron's friends to speak with him and cast curative magics, fireworks lit up the evening sky. In the midst of this, a guard approached the adventurers that had saved the Baron's life and provided them with a special note of thanks from Darkarrow, along with a number of gifts.</p>
<h3>Events of Uncertain Date</h3>
<p>Around the late 14 th century DR, whilst he still lived in Ravens Bluff, Sir Lorien financed the construction of the Silvermoon Playhouse.</p>
<p>He attended the Greengrass Celebration , sponsored by the temple of Lliira The Trumpeter reported on rumors that Lorien Darkarrow was seen embracing Dominique Thorin , whilst her spouse Alexander Thorin sipped on a tankard of goats milk , sneering with disapproval on the festivities. And was among those who signed the guest book at a housewarming gala celebrating the construction and opening of Briar's Patch , a building that served as a residence, boarding house, and Chauntean chapel, owned by the cleric Briar Oldhill .</p>
<p>Thayan Ambassador Belakira filed an official complaint with the governing body of Ravens Bluff over an attack on the nation of Thay, perpetrated by an adventurer or a group of adventurers from the City of Ravens. The charges included a number of murdered Red Wizards of Thay. An eyewitness fingered a man resembling Lord Lorien Darkarrow, disguised as a Red Wizard, as one of the perpetrators; however, the evidence was scant and unreliable. Belakira later gave a detailed interview about the accusations to Armond Arhesian for the Uktar - Nightal issue of the of Trumpeter . Mayor Thoden handled the accusations boldly, having previously interviewed the young lord at Fort Thoden whilst recuperating from horrible acid burns that he alleged came from a fight with black dragon , even showing off sharp teeth from the dragon to prove his claims. According to the Trumpeter , on a request from the Mayor, the Lathanderite cleric Sir Voltroy arranged for a fellow cleric to cast regeneration on the crippled Lord.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Many a rumor surrounded this prominent public figure. In some cases these rumors had an element of truth to them, such as his secret membership in the Harpers or secretly being one of the owners of Potions, Lotions and Notions. Following the death of his wife and his distancing from the public eye, rumors circulated that he was keeping Mirial's corpse in Darksilver House, watching over it. However, many scoffed at this libelous gossip. In the years following the Three Women War, rumors would make claim that he had found a new love and was spending weeks away from Ravens Bluff visiting her, whilst other gossips claimed he was working on new rituals of magic or busy with the business of being a Harper.</p>
