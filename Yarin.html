<p>Yarin was a retired pickpocket from the the capital of Amn , Athkatla during the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Yarin owned gloves of pickpocketing . Among other items, he had a potion of extra healing stashed away, as well as a scroll of melf's acid arrow , next to a History of Shadowdale tome.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point before the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Yarin retired from the life of thievery and spent his time in the illicit backrooms of the Copper Coronet in the slums of Athkatla's River District . He was aware of the recently raging guild war in the city, but he was not a member of the Shadow Thieves . At some point, he was approached by a member of the new guild, secretly a vampire coven, trying to recruit Yarin. The new mysterious guild was not picky in who they recruited; younglings and old men like Yarin were among them, and the offer was quite lucrative. However, Yarin had little interest in returning to the rogue's life.</p>
