<p>Thamator was a Harper in the mid-late 8 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Thamator was strict and had almost no patience or sympathy.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He had a sword that glowed.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Though his loneliness had made him open to becoming a foster father to Alustriel and Sylune , his relationship with Alustriel became almost too sour for words when her progress in the Art stalled. It may have improved later.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 767 DR , Thamator the Old was already a Harper and on his fifth decade of life. On that year, or not long before it, he had lost some family to the evil wizard Gulthund , including his younger brother, Rarleniir the Raven, Rarleniir's wife, the sorceress Selûneshar , and their two daughters. A disguised Mystra brought two of her children to him, disguising them as his kin; so, Thamator became the foster father to two of the Seven Sisters , Alustriel and Sylune, after the death of their birth mother, Elué Shundar , and their abandonment by Dornal Silverhand . Sylune was later educated by Hauliyr , another Harper, while Alustriel remained under his care.</p>
<p>He hired the mage Thurduil to educate her, and later on, Gaerd . On 778 DR , with their relationship tightly strained by Alustriel's lack of progress in the art, Thamator refused Alustriel entry in the Harpers, and then allowed Lord Irlar to court her. On the night of Uktar 12 of that year, he found that Alustriel had slain Lord Irlar by throwing him off a window; he was disturbed, but still quite pleased by that.</p>
