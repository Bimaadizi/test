<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Shil and her crew took the Buccaneer's Tear over to the city of Neverwinter to investigate strange goings-on at the earthmote known as Pirates' Skyhold floating above the city. While they originally made an effort to recover some wreckage from the crashed skyship Magister's Hope , the company's forward scouts and their adventurer ally came across a group of mutineers from the vessel helmed by Captain Kayliss , second-in-command to the legendary undead pirate king, Bartholomew Blackdagger .</p>
<p>The adventurer managed to work with one of the disaffected pirates, Norver the Cook , and infiltrate Kayliss' hideaway lair . After destroying the undead former first mate, Shil and Company Yargo acquired the surviving skyship to expand what would hopefully become a growing fleet for the up-and-coming mercenary company.</p>
