<p>A tablet of reawakening was an item crafted by the Wychlaran of Rashemen as of the late 15 th century DR to counteract the potent necromancy of the Red Wizards of Thay .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was a small and flat rectangular piece of stone covered in inscriptions. Down the center, in golden letters in the Thorass alphabet , it read "ADDUCERE AD VITAM." It was designed to sit in a small pedestal of curved stone when not needed.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>By reciting its inscription and giving the name of the one to be resurrected, the tablet could be used to cast a version of the true resurrection spell that was powerful enough to revive individuals who otherwise could not be raised without the direct aid of a deity . It was one of the only known means to revive someone slain by a Red Wizard blade .</p>
<p>The tablet could be used only once, at which point it would disintegrate.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A tablet of reawakening came to be included in the collection of dangerous treasures amassed by the Harpers at Korinn's Keep during the late 15 th century DR. In the late 1490s DR, the allure and promise of acquiring a tablet of resurrection prompted ex-Harper Edgin Darvis to agree to aid the conman Forge Fitzwilliam and the wizard Sofina in breaking into the Keep. Edgin desired the tablet to revive his wife Zia , who had been slain nine years prior by a Red Wizard blade . However, he did not tell their daughter Kira , for fear of getting hopes up in case he should fail.</p>
<p>Upon entering the Keep and finding the tablet of reawakening on a pedestal covered in spider webs, Edgin picked it up and failed to notice a cord disguised amongst the webbing, which snapped and sounded the alarm. Edgin and his longtime friend Holga Kilgore were ultimately captured and sent to Revel's End prison for two years while their accomplices fled.</p>
<p>Upon their escape from prison and reunion with Forge and Sofina, they learned that they had been betrayed. Not only had their capture been intended by Forge and Sofina, but subsequently the pair had lied to Kira, telling her that Edgin had left her to seek a "tablet of riches" and that he was lying to her about wanting to revive her mother. Forge refused to return either Kira or the tablet to Edgin, and claimed he could get a "bundle" for it in Skullport .</p>
<p>Edgin would ultimately win Kira back and reacquire the tablet of reawakening , however Holga was then slain by Sofina using a Red Wizard blade . Realizing that his and Kira's relationship to Holga was now much more important than clinging to the memory of his lost wife, Edgin chose to use the tablet of reawakening's one charge to revive her instead.</p>
