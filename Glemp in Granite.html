<p>Glemp in Granite was a sculpture gifted to the good and humble folk of Gillian's Hill by a local sculptor named Yujist Glemp sometime before 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Yujist Glemp was the "almost famous" sculptor from Gillian's Hill. He created this sculpture as a gift for Gillian's Hill, and it was proudly displayed on the hamlet's streets. However, the generous gesture rang hollow as the statue bore an uncanny resemblance to the sculptor himself. Eventually, to no one's surprise, an unknown person "refined" the sculpture late at night with a hammer and a chisel . Angered, Glemp stormed around the hamlet, trying to find the culprit, albeit unsuccessfully. The sculptor immodestly decided to re-bestow the sculpture on the "ungrateful peasants," as he called them, of Gillian's Hill. The new and improved version was to be a gold casting of himself, elevated by an obelisk, "out of each of their barbarous chisels."</p>
<p>However, Yujist Glemp mysteriously disappeared before he had a chance even to start working on the new statue. The defaced sculpture was moved away from the decent folks of Gillian's Hill eyesight and into the back of Torleth's Treasures , the local antiques and "junk" shop. Glemp in Granite , as it came to be known, was still in Torleth Mindulspeer 's store as of 1372 DR.</p>
