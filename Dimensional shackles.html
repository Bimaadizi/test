<p>Dimensional shackles were magical shackles that not only restricted movement, but also prevented extradimensional displacement.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The shackles automatically adjusted to fit creatures of several different sizes, ranging from halflings to ogres .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A creature bound with dimensional shackles was incapable of any sort of extradimensional travel, be it teleporting within the same plane or traveling to a different plane. Travel through preexisting portals was still possible, however.</p>
<p>Although it was possible to break free from dimensional shackles , it was extremely difficult. It was only possible to attempt to break free from them once every 30 days.</p>
