<p>Relair's Mistake was a magical cloak that allowed the wearer to transform themself into a wolf for a limited amount of time.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>At will, the wearer of this cloak could transform themself into a wolf for a duration of two minutes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This cloak was crafted by the mage Relair , and named for the folly of his hubris. Relair believed himself to have more control over arcane magic than he actually possessed and, while crafting it, he inflicted himself with lycanthropy . Despite the inherent power of the garment, Relair was unable to change his form as he so pleased.</p>
<p>At some point before 1368 DR , the cloak was stashed away in a cave on the Sword Coast , just a ways south of Baldur's Gate .</p>
