<h2>History</h2>
<p>This dynasty began during an era of some 1300 years of peace following the unification of Coramshan and Mir into the nation of Calimshan by the warlord Ukhar IV .</p>
<p>Like many of the dozen dynasties of this age, the Marekhs faced the threat of plagues, which many modern Calishite scholars believed were created intentionally by the Jhaamdathan Empire. In particular, the Sunrise Plague in −3332 DR nearly slew the entire capital city, including more than half of the Marekh family. The heir, Daud yn Khadil el Marekh, survived the plague and ruled, but he could not do so from decimated Calimport, as people feared living there again. When his reign of twelve years ended, so did his dynasty and the First Age.</p>
<p>It would not be until −3250 DR , nearly a century later, that a bakkal would rule in Calimport again. That bakkal was the first member of the Pahlemn Dynasty and ushered in Calimshan's Second Age .</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>One of the sabbans in the city of Calimport was named after this dynasty, Marekh Sabban in Emerald Ward .</p>
