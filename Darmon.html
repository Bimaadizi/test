<p>Sir Darmon was a male human and member of the Nine of Neverwinter on the Sword Coast North in the 1370s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>If the Kalach-Cha and the companions sided with the Watch and raided the Smuggler's warehouse , Darmon would appear before them giving orders to his men, since this problem worried Lord Nasher himself. The Kalach-Cha would've told him that the thieves at the warehouse have been dealt with. Darmon and his men would be sad as they had to be at the court with gentleman and ladies. However, Kalach-Cha could recommend the Sunken Flagon as the place to drink, making Darmon and his men cheerful and Kalach-Cha a bit chaotic.</p>
