<p>The Restorers were an organization of desert giants dedicated to reclaiming the city of Ubar, or Dayya from the terrible jann who occupied it.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Restorers did what they could to hamper the way of life for the jann inhabiting Ubar. They often raided jann communities, poisoned their wells, and scattered their herds. They caused little relative harm to the jann of Dayya considering the population of the large city.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>These giants were active within the Genies' Anvil of the High Desert .</p>
