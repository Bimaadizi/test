<p>Idruth was a Selûnite acolyte and the head cook of Moonshadow Hall in Yhaunn during the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Idruth led a team of cooks who fed the inhabitants of Moonshadow Hall. She and her cooks were also responsible for preparing the feast for the New Moon Beneficence , the temple's monthly charity banquet. The kitchen and the cooks fell under the ultimate responsibility of the senior priestess Velsinore , who handled all internal administration of the temple.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of 1373 DR , Idruth served under High Moonmistress Dhauna Myritar . From Eleasis of that year, she served under Moonmistress-Designate Feena Archwood during the tumultuous events of that period, continuing to run the kitchen dutifully and loyally despite the transformation of Moonmistress Dhauna into a werewolf and her subsequent death. Her dedication to the feeding of her charges was only thwarted when Sharrans cultists publicly attacked the Beneficence feast she was assembling.</p>
