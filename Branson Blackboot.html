<p>Branson Blackboot was the innkeeper of the Old Man's Face inn in the village of Tyrluk in the kingdom of Cormyr in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid-1480s DR , Branson was involved in shady dealings working with well-known criminals to extort money from his fellow townspeople in Tyrluk. However, after the Cormyrean adventurer-noble Oriphaun Huntsilver hid a fragment of the Abyssal Planus Mechanus Nether Scroll at the Old Man's Face, an army of sellswords led by Netherese wizards came down the High Road and broke into the inn in search of it. While the bartender, William Windsphere , hid himself in a crate in the tavern basement, Branson locked himself in his office, where he stayed until adventurers who were also searching for the scroll fragment arrived. When the mercenaries were killed, Branson gave the adventurers a key to the barn, where he kept the tavern key.</p>
