<p>The lurking regard was a theory supported by a few spellcasters and scholars. According to this theory, some spells were self-aware, with consciousness granted by unknown entities. This theory was used to "explain" why some spells sometimes seemed to either aid or thwart certain spellcasters or other creatures that used those spells.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>According to Elminster Aumar , this theory was based on truth, although it had been exaggerated. The "consciousnesses" that were classified as the "lurking regard" were in fact the same ones that existed within intelligent items and the so-called living spells .</p>
<p>It was believed by some scholars that an individual named Estel Orvraunt was able to detect and talk to the "lurking regard" of some spells.</p>
