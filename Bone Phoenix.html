<p>Bone Phoenixes were landmark weapons created for Lord Craghand of Unther in the Old Empires .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Bone Phoenixes were enchanted +1 bludgeons that scorched their targets with magical flames upon successful strikes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The name "Bone Phoenix" was a reference to Lord Craghand's grim fate. In life, Craghand lacked any talent in the arcane and in attempts to prolong his life, a small army of necromancers in his employ ensorcelled the lord and his court to a strange type of undeath. The magic bludgeons, however, did not stay with their undying master, and by the late 14 th century, several of the Bone Phoenixes found their way to the Sword Coast . In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , High Captain Baram of Luskan wielded one of these fiery morning stars . Another Bone Phoenix was found in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , lost in a cave not far from the Weeping Willow Inn in the Mere of Dead Men .</p>
