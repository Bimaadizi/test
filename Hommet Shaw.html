<p>Hommet Shaw was a human necromancer from Longsaddle .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Hommet was a young, talented, and eager necromancer, but he was not a very detail-oriented person. Despite the reputation of most necromancers, he sought a mentor who wasn't evil or insane.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hommet was from the eccentric Harpell family.</p>
<p>He was born to a young pair of farmers in a small village near Longsaddle. He was a scrawny child, and no use around the farm. As such, his parents sent him off to live with his Uncle Kipper Harpell . He managed to get exiled by the Harpells after raising some zombies he shouldn't have.</p>
<p>At some point before 1487 DR , he travelled to Luskan , where he at various times got mugged, kidnapped and blackmailed.</p>
<p>He trained under the mage Maferil , but was sento to Neverwinter sometime before the wizard's death around 1487 DR . He returned to Luskan after hearing of Maferil's murder. He wanted to join an adventuring party in order to prove himself but also make some allies in the process. During the journey to Luskan, his caravan was ambushed, and, to save his own life, he played dead and was dragged to the bandits' hideout, where he later encountered the Champion of the Burning Dawn .</p>
<p>While travelling with the Champion of the Burning Dawn, Hommet received a letter from Dagatha , who communicated that she was working for a book collector in Luskan, and that she had a tome that might be of use to him in developing his magical powers. Eager to prove his worth, he asked the Champion to join him in seeking out this tome.</p>
