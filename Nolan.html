<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The friar was a short fat man with a bald head.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Festival of the Spring Equinox in the Year of the Saddle, 1345 DR , Nolan set up a white tent near the druid grove in Caer Corwell to preach the existence of gods other than the Earthmother . Despite his difference of opinion, Nolan protected the druid Robyn from Kazgaroth during the Beast's siege of Caer Corwell, suffering grievous injuries in the fight.</p>
