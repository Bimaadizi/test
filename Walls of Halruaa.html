<p>The Walls were a crescent-shaped mountain range that towered up to 20,000 feet (6,100 meters) over Halruaa , surrounding the country on three sides.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Prior to the Spellplague the mountains formed a natural defense for the realm. The three sections of the mountain range–the Nathaghal , Lhairghal , and Muaraghal Mountains –formed a stout border.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the range's height made it difficult for Halruaans to escape the effects of the Spellplague. Three passes connected the remnants of Halruaa to the rest of Faerûn . The Azhal Pass and Talath Pass were difficult for a large group to travel. Only the wider High Aluar pass offered a secure route for any sizable group.</p>
