<p>Dreels , or trollfingers , were river eel -like fish native to the River Reaching , particularly the area of the river between the Misty Stair waterfalls and Skull Gorge .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Somewhere between green and black in color, dreels were relatively short and stocky.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Dreels subsisted on algae and carrion, which helped keep the river clean. They felt quite at home in the icy waters of the River Reaching.</p>
<h2>As food</h2>
<p>In spite of their mucus-like taste, dreels were quite nourishing. Their taste improved considerably if served properly, for example fried or pickled with herbs and spices .</p>
<p>In the 1490s DR, the Cutlass inn in Luskan advertised a "breakfast special" consisting of brandy and dreels.</p>
