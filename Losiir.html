<h2>History</h2>
<p>Losiir was a githyanki soldier from crèche K'liir . In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , he was a member of a group of githyanki dragon riders chasing a mind flayer nautiloid to obtain the Astral Prism . During the assault on the nautiloid, Losiir was captured. Mind flayers inserted a tadpole into his eye thus beginning the process of ceremorphosis . He managed to escape the capsule where he was detained when the ship was in Avernus . Losiir headed to the nautiloid's helm while trying to take control of the vessel and fighting the attacking imps . He planned to get to a crèche where he could be cleansed of the tadpole via a zaith'isk .</p>
<p>However, Losiir and the tadpole in his head died in the crash of the nautiloid. Some said that they saw a githyanki corpse on the Ravaged Beach while the others insisted that his body was hidden by Lae'zel when she woke up after the crash. [ speculation ]</p>
