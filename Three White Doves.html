<p>The Three White Doves was a unique enchanted Ilmatari mace of ivory , crafted in 850 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This curiously-shaped ivory-headed bludgeon was affixed atop a shaft of black-enameled steel with its handle carved of ivory as well. The weapon's handle and head were locked in place with golden bands. The head of the aptly-named mace was carved in the shape of three white doves facing inward to the weapon's shaft. All thee birds had their wings open, forming the mace's flanges.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Three White Doves possessed a powerful +4 enchantment and was especially deadly to undead creatures. A single hit had a chance of instantly destroying an undead creature. When wielded against creatures from the Outer Planes , the mace still had a chance of destroying them. However, the chance of it happening was significantly less than with the undead beings.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The weapons was created by Alledec , a cleric of Ilmater , in the Year of the Empty Throne, 850 DR . By that year, Alledec had been fighting for the Church of Ilmater for two decades and wanted to leave a more palpable legacy than violence. When Alledec died in his sleep, three years after completing the Three White Doves , the mace was bestowed upon a fighter in service of the Church of Ilmater. Subsequently, the traveling fighter passed the Doves to an Ilmatari priest Recken the Bold , who, in turn, lost the mace in a battle with a vampire not far from the Trollbark Forest on the Sword Coast . Eventually, Recken the Bold slew the blood-sucking undead, but the Three White Doves were lost to the church.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , the weapon found its way into the hands of Quinn Silverfinger , a cleric of Waukeen in the Golden Lodge of Lonelywood .</p>
