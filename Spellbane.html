<p>Spellbane was a type of plant often used as a herb for its magic -nullification properties.</p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>A living creature that ate a piece of spellbane lost all ability to cast spells for a period of 3â€“12 hours, though it did not impede their ability to use magical items . For the same period, the creature gained a resistance to magic, or an enhanced resistance if they already possessed such a thing. The degree of resistance depended on the amount consumed, from a sprig or leaf, to a whole plant, to a vast quantity, though it had an upper limit.</p>
<h2>Habitats</h2>
<p>The spellbane plant was only known to grow in Cormyr . It clung to rocks in areas of deep shade, such as in clefts, in piles of stones in forests, and in the mouths of caves.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Around 1369 , Hanno Minstrelsong of Hanno's Herbs and Medicines in Wheloon , Cormyr , sold spellbane. It was the rarest and most expensive of his stock. He usually had only one small live plant or a small keg of dried leaves in stock. The plant would cost at least 100 gp , while a piece was upwards of 40 gp , and one dried leaf was 25 gp .</p>
