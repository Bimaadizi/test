<p>Rugs of smothering were magically animated rugs that were commonly employed as traps . They attacked by trapping and constraining their victims.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>There was a large variety of shapes and appearances that a rug of smothering could be made into. They sometimes were built to resemble carpets of flying , but were otherwise indistinguishable from ordinary, non-magical rugs, except if inspected through magical detection.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>The typical tactic adopted by a rug of smothering in combat was to rise and constrict a target creature standing on it or next to it. The trapped creature could not breathe while imprisoned and was slowly crushed by the rug unless freed. While a rug of smothering had a creature in its grasp, it had the ability to deflect part of any damage it received to its victim.</p>
<p>Like all constructs , rugs of smothering were susceptible to antimagic effects. They immediately fell unconscious while inside an antimagic field and could be knocked out for up to a minute if targeted by a dispel magic spell .</p>
