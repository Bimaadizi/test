<p>The Light Tube was an invention by Cadderly Bonaduce .</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>The tube itself was a foot-long cylinder two inches in diameter. It consisted of two parts, with one end covered by a metal cap.</p>
<p>A disk was inserted in the tube, which had been enchanted by Histra , a priestess of Sune , with a dweomer of light as bright as pure sunlight.</p>
<h2>Use</h2>
<p>The metal cap on the tube shielded the light. When popped off, a focused beam of light was projected. The light beam can be adjusted by a twist of the upper part of the cylinder.</p>
