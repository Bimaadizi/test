<p>Bregubrod Dryctcyni was an adventuring conjurer who found love in an ogre 's embrace, marrying Willac Tatthryd , a female ogre and a fellow adventurer in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>At the age of twenty-two, Bregubrod was quite tall and gaunt: 6 feet and 7 inches (2 meters), weighing 177 pounds (80.3 kilograms). He had long, straight black hair and brown eyes and was overall a dark and daunting person, dressed in black.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Bregubrod's personality changed after spending time with Willac Tatthryd. However, he was still a greedy man, insisting on helping others but always finding a way to help himself in the process. When an opportunity presented itself, Bregubrod eagerly exchanged spells with other mages but only if he received more than he provided in the exchange. He was emotionally distant and did not tolerate small talk, preferring magical or historical research instead.</p>
<p>When adventuring, Bregubrod was cautious and prepared to protect himself with prepared defensive spells or showering the undead with holy water .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As a mage , Bregubrod was trained in fighting with a dagger . He was knowledgeable on the topics of ancient history, spellcraft, herbalism , and using a rope . He was also a skilled brewer. Bregubrod's spellbook was mostly filled with combat-oriented conjuration magics, such as shocking grasp , glitterdust , Melf's acid arrow , summon swarm , and vampiric touch . His defensive arsenal included such spells as mage armor , hypnotism , mount , mirror image , rope trick , and invisibility , among others.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Bregubrod's leather backpack was filled with a dozen daggers, nine vials of holy water , a potion of invisibility , and a potion of mammal control .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Bregubrod was fully devoted to his ogre wife and learned to let heckling and offensive comments go when amidst other people. Despite being a selfish man, he always sought to pamper his wife, coming up with gifts and showering her with attention.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bregubrod Dryctcyni's adventuring career was quite fresh by the time he married, as he had only begun adventuring at the age of twenty-one. But his aspirations were grim: he sought to increase his magely powers and eventually become a lich . One day, he was hired as a henchman to an adventuring ogress but was horrified when it was revealed that the ogress was a morally upright human male cleric who has been reincarnated as a female ogre. Despite that, the two came to enjoy each other's company. The ogress named Willac Tatthryd often proselytized and preached good morals, and with time, it rubbed off, making Bregubrod a better man.</p>
<p>Bregubrod's attitude towards Willac changed to infatuation after the mage tasted an unknown potion that turned out to be a philter of love at the age of twenty-two. The wizard courted the ogress for several months until proclaiming his undying love. Willac was not used to a man's affections and this much attention. But despite it all, she developed feelings for the little man, and the two tied the knot.</p>
