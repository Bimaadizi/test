<p>In 1369 DR , Staenyn was at a certain Thayvian temple of Shar where the Red Wizard Azmyrandyr was quartered at the time. The Red Wizard was targetted for elimination by the Simbul in response to an attack on Silverymoon on which he participated. After she slew Azmyrandyr and all his apprentices, she proceeded to slay all nearby Red Wizards and the temple staff; Temple Master Maeldur called on Staenyn to rouse two visitors, one of which he deemed mightier than Azmyrandyr: Ylondan the Tall and Largrond of the Lash.</p>
<p>Staenyn got them to join the fray, but he was then tripped by Ylondan, and slain by a blade barrier the Simbul had hijacked and rendered mobile with her magic, which she sent down his way while he was still down.</p>
