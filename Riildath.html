<p>The Riildath was a large forest in northeast Faerûn and east Faerûn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Clan Sethomiir dark elves migrated to the Riildath in −10,400 DR and established Narathmault . When the dark elves became drow in −10,000 DR , fiends escaped Narathmault and the drow fled to caverns beneath the Thayan Plateau .</p>
<p>Sun elf and moon elf refugees from Shantel Othreier arrived in −9750 DR and established the realm of Lethyr , vowing to cleanse the Riildath of non-elves and the horrors of Narathmault. They used High Magic in −2465 DR to protect the forest from the advancing Great Glacier , but the glacier's advance, displacing hobgoblins and the Nars , instigated conflicts between both groups and the elves in −2460 DR .</p>
<p>In −1020 DR , the elves of Lethyr abandoned the northern portion of the Riildath and an arm of the Great Glacier began scouring the valley of the Great Dale , splitting the forest into the Rawlinswood and the Forest of Lethyr . Tharos , a chieftain of the Nars, discovered the ruins of Narathmault in −1015 DR . His son, Thargaum , established the kingdom of Tharos in −987 DR , and as its first Nentyarch , built its capital, Dun-Tharos , at the site in −970 DR .</p>
