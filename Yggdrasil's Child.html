<h2>History</h2>
<p>Liriel Baenre visited the tree in the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR to inscribe a rune on the tree in order to gain the power of the Windwalker amulet. She was led to it and somewhat instructed in regards to it by Ulf the Shaman of Ruathym town. She described the tree as a magical, huge ancient oak with dozens of complex runes carved into the tree. She also explained that it was the "symbol of life."</p>
<p>When the Storm Maiden was born, her mother was sheltering from a storm beneath Yggdrasil's Child. Using the dagger that she had used to cut the umbilical cord, the young mother carved her daughter's true name into the tree while asking the god of war, Tempus , to bless her child. The god answered her prayer but so did the sea goddess Umberlee , and both of them conferred mighty blessings upon the newborn girl. Umberlee then struck down the woman with a bolt of lightning, and carried the baby to Norland in the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR , the tree could no longer be used as a portal .</p>
