<p>The Isle of the Cursed was an island in the middle of the Skysea zone of Raurin . The dry riverbed of the Athis river led towards the center of its hills, where the city of Medinat Muskawoon once lay.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The isle spanned just under 10 mi (16 km) across. It was covered in hills, which looked deformed, twisted, and battered, with some of it looking as though it had been squeezed; there were many scattered boulders and sharp, daggerlike edges. There was no vegetation; the hues of the rocks ranged from the red to brown to ashen, all of them reminiscent of gore. A sticky-sweet smell hung in the air.</p>
<p>A limestone causeway crossed the hills from the northwest towards the center; it was no narrower than 20 ft (6.1 m), perfectly smooth and flat. The old riverbed of the Athis had also came to be full of sand and glass during the creation of the Skysea, creating a pathway from the north into the center of the island, allowing cloudskates to reach Medinat Muskawoon.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Isle of the Cursed lay in the middle of the Skysea.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Isle of the Cursed acquired the configuration that persisted until the mid-14 th century DR after a battle between the wizard Martek and the efreet Khalitarius .</p>
<h2>Hazards</h2>
<p>The hills of the cursed isle were sheer and very difficult to climb; the hazards were many, and even the smallest fall could prove deadly. The shore line, lined with smooth, loose, softball size rocks required intense attention to navigate their treacherousness. Even the act of simply walking could turn deadly over time.</p>
<p>The limestone causeway was so bright and white it hurt the eyes to even look at it; it was impossible to discern further than 10 feet from it during the day, and it was possible to injure more than one's eyes by being careless with it.</p>
