<p>Koguryo was a kingdom in the land of Choson and later a province of the kingdom of Koryo in Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Koguryo lay in the south-western "toe" of the boot-like shape of the Koryo Peninsula , centered around the Ziyero Ridge . It was bordered in the north-east along the Tumen River by the kingdom of Silla and flanked on both sides of the peninsula by the Straits of Koryo and the Dragon's Teeth straits.</p>
<p>Sites within Koguryo were the Dang Caverns , Naktong Moors , and the Tumen River and Ziyero Ridge.</p>
<h2>Locations</h2>
<p>The kingdom included the city of Pyong Do .</p>
<p>The later province of Koguryo included the settlements of Ansong , Konang Pen , Mo'ki , Ojy-do , Paektu-san , Pan , Pyong Do, and Taiku .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A famed general of Koguryo named Huat Rhu once led his soldiers on an expedition into the Naktong Moors. They never returned. By the 14th century DR , it was rumored they still wandered the moors, now as peat mummies and zombies hunting for fresh blood.</p>
<p>In the early 14th century, the rival kingdom of Silla was at war with Koguyro, under the then king of Silla . In the 1330s DR , the king of Silla conquered Koguyro and Saishu , unifying the whole land of Choson into the Sillan Empire and defending against all threats.</p>
<p>Finally, around 1350 DR , the king of Silla's secret invasion of Kozakura ended in catastrophe that saw the end of his reign; he abdicated and fled. In his place, General Wanang Sun seized the throne, becoming king and reforming the Sillan Empire into the Empire of Koryo . He welded Koguryo and the old factions of Choson into a unified nation. Koguryo was thereafter a province of Koryo.</p>
<p>By 1357 DR , Koguryo was governed by an array of petty lords, who held allegiance to King Wanang Sun but might struggle for their independence when he passed on.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>Around 1356 DR , in Shou eyes, Koguryo was seen as one of the petty kingdoms of Koryo who paid tribute to the Shou Lung empire.</p>
