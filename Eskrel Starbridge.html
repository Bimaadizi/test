<p>Eskrel Starbridge was a Highknight of Cormyr in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>He was stern-looking.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>During the Tethgard raid, Eskrel Starbridge was part of the same squad as Merlar and Therlon . Later, he assembled a force of his own for a mission to Shadowdale, looking for Elminster. The force included a number of Highknights including Baerengard and Narulph , and the War Wizards Lemmeth and Mereld .</p>
<p>As head of the Highknights, his Clerk of Vigilance was Talonar Winter .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He carried a teleport ring that belonged to Filfaeril Obarskyr , until he yielded it unto Storm Silverhand .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He was a veteran Highkight by 1479 DR , when he became the Head Highknight. Per Storm Silverhand, he was one of the few that could be trusted to do much of anything.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Eskrel Starbridge had been part of the raid on Tethgard in Mirtul 5 of 1479 DR against the fugitive wizard Elminster Aumar . During the raid, Storm Silverhand , an accomplice of Elminster's, snuck up on him and knocked him unconscious with longsleep herb before the confrontation. Thus, he survived the raid.</p>
<p>After the raid, Eskrel became the new head of all highknights. Acting on information from Rorskryn Mreldrake , he decided to go seek out Elminster in Shadowdale , personally. He came across a doppelganger pretending to be him, and then across Storm Silverhand , whom they initially mistook for the Old Mage, until they saw her bare chest as she introduced herself as the Marchioness of Immerdusk . She convinced him to yield up his teleport ring .</p>
<p>He was unable to return in time for the Council of the Dragon . By the time he returned to Castle Obarskyr , Arclath Delcastle , a minor nobleman, was being chased by the death knight Targrael . He got commanded by Glathra Barcantle to capture Arclath, Amarune Whitewave , Storm Silverhand , and Elminster Aumar . Later, Talonar Winter and him were the ones who reported the death of everyone in Staghaven House to Glathra, including Rorstil Hallowdant , who wasn't supposed to be there.</p>
<p>Eskrel was among the retinue protecting King Foril Obarskyr I during the Festival of Handras , when the Wizards of War became aware of a plot to draw out the blueflame ghosts and anticipated a dangerous situation for the King. Foril insisted in a different tactic, where the ghosts would be lured out of the palace; they succeeded on that.</p>
