<p>A staff of slinging was an enchanted quarterstaff capable of slinging objects through the air.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These quarterstaffs made it easier for the wielder to strike and harm their opponents. If wielded by a druid , a staff of slinging could hurl roughly spherical objects through the air. The size of the object could be no larger than 9 in (23 cm) in diameter and had to weigh less than 5 lb (2.3 kg). The druid simply touched one end of the staff to the object then swung the staff toward a target, releasing the held object with a mental command. The object would rise slightly when thrown, moving upward 1 ft (0.3 m) for every 10 ft (3 m) traveled. Larger objects could be hurled in this manner if the druid expended one of the staff's charges.</p>
<p>Druids were capable of recharging these items.</p>
