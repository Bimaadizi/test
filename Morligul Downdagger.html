<p>Traevyn Illance had hired him for a while after the disaster in the Council of the Dragon of 1479 DR; he was sent together with Scarmar Heldeth to capture Rauligus Helderstone . They also assaulted the home where the man was staying, and took him captive; along the way, they also captured Storm Silverhand and slew everyone there, save for the War Wizard Reldyk Applecrown , whose comatose body was actually harboring the mind of Elminster Aumar . Knowing they had failed to capture or slay one of the people there, Scarmar Heldeth decided to flee the city, fearful of what the loose end may bring.</p>
<p>Downdagger continued alone to the Three Ravens , a local tavern, where he met with Traevyn Illance. Inside the tavern, he was knocked out and impersonated by Elminster Aumar, who'd followed him in a trice.</p>
