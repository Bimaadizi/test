<p>Borea was a powerful sorceress from deep North Faerûn whose fearsome powers of freezing cold coursed through her veins.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before 1369 DR , Borea ventured into the city of Myth Drannor to never be seen again. Even though mysteriously disappeared, Borea's reputation remained a known story. Faeril and Beriand , worshipers of Mystra , the goddess of magic, knew of the sorceress and claimed that a single drop of her blood could turn a dozen able-bodied men into frozen statues.</p>
<p>A unique powerful enchanted dagger , effectively a shard of magical ice, was known as Borea's Blood and was highly sought after by merchants who knew of Borea's story. The dagger's powers could spread deep freeing walls of ice if left unchecked. Eventually, the dagger was the weapon that ended the evil reign of Kya Mordrayn of the Cult of the Dragon in 1369 DR.</p>
