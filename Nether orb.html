<p>The nether orb was a magical crystal orb used by the forces of the Empire of Shade in the mid-1480s DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The orb was carved from crystal that had a deep purple color.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The orb's primary use was in stealing life force from an injured victim and giving it to the wielder as magical energy. Thus, a caster could remain refreshed as long as they could keep physically striking a target. Less obviously, it granted a measure of protection against all sorts of hostile effects, especially elemental threats, and made the wielder's spells a little more deadly.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The orb was used by Netherese forces led by the arcanist Shai when she and Archwizard Amskar captured the meddling Oriphaun Huntsilver at Yarrow Glade in the Storm Horns . The ambush was broken by Oriphaun's allies, who defeated Shai and her group, and captured the orb in the process.</p>
