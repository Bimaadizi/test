<p>Iurnan Chall was a mercenary mage and a member of the Sailors of the Crimson Sea mercenary company based out of Airspur in Chessenta in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 1350s DR, Iurnan and the Sailors of the Crimson Sea marched to the town of Timindar in Chondath, having been hired by Lord Reland Tymin to confront the dark forces of Yrkhetep at Thurgabanteth . However, while passing the edge of the Chondalwood , they were ambushed by unknown enemies. Although the Sailors prevailed and killed all the ambushers, they were left with many wounded and dead, including their commander, Bendix . Lhrek Jarsyn became their acting commander.</p>
<p>After sending a messenger to Timindar, Lhrek, Iurnan, and other veteran members of the company went into the Chondalwood in search of more food. However, after killing a deer , cutting some branches, and starting a fire, they were captured by the druid Variath and his treants , who put them on trial. The treants demanded justice, accepting an apology and a compensation of 1000 gp . However, Lhrek refused, so Variath threatened execution. Adventurers sent from Timindar may have aided their trial; they were not executed and went on to Timindar.</p>
<p>Soon after, the Sailors fought in the Battle of Thurgabanteth.</p>
<p>After a brief political power struggle between Iurnan and Lhrek, by 1357 DR Lhrek had emerged as leader of the Sailors but he took Chall as his chief advisor and assistant.</p>
<p>They were active again in the early 1360s DR.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Iurnan considered himself a better choice as leader of the company, being older and supposedly wiser, and tried to undermine Lhrek by saying mean things behind his back, which lower morale in the company. Although treacherous, he would not go so far as to betray or kill Lhrek.</p>
