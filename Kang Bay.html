<p>Kang Bay was a bay between the two branches of the Koryo Peninsula in Koryo in northeast Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Locations</h2>
<p>It held a number of islands, large and small, the greatest of which were Quelpart and Kanko . Kanko was actually a volcano that emerged from the sea.</p>
<p>Anticlockwise around the bay lay the Koryoan settlements of Tu Pe and its floating city; Xi Hulang on the mouth of the Hoparatu River , which flowed into the bay; Koje ; Xai Chung ; and Bejung , closest to Kanko.</p>
<p>The bay bordered the Sea of Kozakura .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In ancient times, when the Kanko volcano rose up out of Kang Bay and erupted, it was said that the very skies over Koryo caught fire. The land was devastated; the city of Old Bejung , closest to Kanko, was engulfed in poisonous gas that killed all the people, before the city itself was obliterated in a matter of seconds and buried in ash. According to legend, the entire Han clan sought shelter in the vast Dang Caverns .</p>
