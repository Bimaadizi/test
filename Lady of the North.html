<p>The Lady of the North was a mysterious and beautiful ghost of the ruined settlement called Northkeep on the southern side of the Moonsea in north Faer√ªn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to his own tales, Leldor recovered the artifact sword called the Astral Blade from the ruins of Northkeep. Despite his claims, the bard never could offer evidence of the sword ever existing. His story stated that after the Astral Blade was found, the ghosts of the ruins's original defenders approached him under the cover of the night as he slumbered. The ghostly defenders said that the weapon belonged to the Lady of the North. When Leldor asked who this mysterious woman was, a beautiful apparition presented herself to the bard. Leldor immediately fell in love with the Lady and returned her sword.</p>
