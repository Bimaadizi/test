<p>Scarabs of protection were enchanted carved amulets that enveloped the wearer in a protective invisible barrier.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Scarabs of protection were usually carved out of stone or silver to resemble a desert insect , a round bodied scarab . The main telltale sign of its magical protective properties was evident when a scarab was held for over six seconds, when the item manifested an arcane inscription on its surface.</p>
<p>When exposed to a detect magic spell effect, scarabs of protection radiated strong abjuration and necromancy energy.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The magic imbued within these scarabs carried greatly and usually depended on the carver's skills. The invisible magical protective field that surrounded the wearer increased their defenses against magical and mundane negative effects.</p>
<p>A more powerful version of scarabs of protection gave the wearer powerful spell resistance and allowed them to negate magical attacks up to twelve times. Such attacks could be energy-draining, instant death effects, and adverse energy effects. After a scarab absorbed twelve such spells , it shattered and destroyed.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Scarabs of protection could be created by a skilled crafter of wondrous items and the use of death ward and spell resistance spells.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The sages determined the origins of these bug-shaped magical items to lay somewhere far south from the Sword Coast , but the exact location and time of creation remained undetermined. By late 14 th century, these scarabs could be found in many places along the Sword Coast, and cities such as Neverwinter .</p>
