<p>The Fountains of Memory were a mysterious source of water that permitted one to see inside pieces of the history selected by the observer.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Originally, they were a series of pools located somewhere in the Northdark . After the Spellplague , the pools were destroyed but the springs that fed the pools remained. They mingled with ordinary springs, so the waters were not as powerful as before.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally the Fountains of Memory were a sacred place for deep gnomes , who jealously kept the secret of their location. Once in 1379 DR , it was permitted to Q'arlynd Melarn to use them, thanks to his friendship with Flinderspeld .</p>
<p>After the Spellplague, the Fountains were altered. The shadovar managed to claim them and relocated them to their secret village for captured Chosen in the Lost Peaks .</p>
<p>In 1486 DR , Farideh often used it. It was presumed destroyed in the fall of the village.</p>
