<p>Sunblight was an ambitious duergar clan residing in and beneath the Spine of the World mountains of Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>To support their expansion into the surface of Faerûn, the clan erected the fortress Sunblight in the Spine of the World, serving as a kind of gateway between the clan's Underdark holdings and the surface.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Under the leadership of Xardorok Sunblight , the Sunblight clan expanded aggressively into the surface world. Xardorok's ambition was stoked by Asmodeus , who adopted the guise of the duergar deity Deep Duerra to manipulate the dwarven warlord into conquering Icewind Dale .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Sunblight clan was fraught with murder and intrigue. Xardorok Sunblight was married three times and had nine children in total. He killed his first wife, Thizrun , and first son, Ulthoon , for plotting against him. Yrraska , his second wife, was killed in a tunnel collapse, while his third wife Marral died fighting mind flayers . Nearly all of his remaining children died in these two incidents as well, leaving him with only two living sons as of the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR .</p>
<p>Xardorok's aspirations for the Sunblight clan were ultimately foiled, and their fortress was taken over by a tribe of kobolds .</p>
