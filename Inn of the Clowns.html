<p>The Inn of the Clowns was a weak establishment that was once a fine place, located in the village of Bloodstone . The symbol of the inn was a battered sign of a clown juggling bottles of wine. The Inn of the Clowns was once renowned all throughout the Kingdom of Damara . The inn once housed grand entertainment and hospitality to traders far and wide, even rumored to attract the attention of nobility from far away. By the time of 1357 DR , this was no more. The war with the Kingdom of Vaasa had taken its toll on Bloodstone Village.</p>
