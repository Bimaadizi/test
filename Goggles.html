<p>Goggles were a kind of headwear that covered the eyes in a practical and protective manner. A related form were snow goggles , which protected the wearer's eyes from blindingly bright snow.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Goggles resembled spectacles , though with a much tighter fit that enclosed the eyes completely. The lenses were usually cut from glass and the headband made of a leather or heavy-duty cloth .</p>
<p>Goggles protected the wearer's eyes from all sorts of hazards, such as flying insects , noxious gases, dust, high-speed winds, and many other airborne hazards. The lenses could even be of special concave or convex designs that functioned as spectacles for a short- or long-sighted wearer.</p>
<p>In addition to their other properties, magical goggles were usually made to resize to fit widely ranging head sizes, allowing most people to easily wear them provided they had a human -like skull shape.</p>
