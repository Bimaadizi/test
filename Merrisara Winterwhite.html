<p>Merrisara Winterwhite was the leader of New Sharandar , a fortified outpost in the Feywild that was home to elves who descended from ancient Iliyanbruen .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was a dedicated and forthright leader, who worked well to navigate the various political interests of her people.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>While Merrisara served as the commander of New Sharandar in the Feywild, she spent much of her time in Faer√ªn working to restore the ruins of Old Sharandar .</p>
<p>As a leader she often had to mediate the varied interests of her people. Some of them were consumed with seeking revenge against those that plundered their ruined home and focused on little else. Yet others believed their superiority over other peoples forced them to operate in solitude, isolated from other communities. Merrisara disagreed with both of these sentiments, tempering her anger and letting go of her pride for the good of the Iliyanbruen elves.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Merrisara had a strong-willed lieutenant in Olirien Mistcrown , an eladrin who called for extreme violence to be taken against those creatures that befouled what remained of ancient Sharandar. While his rhetoric made the situation more difficult for Merrisara, he remained a loyal ally unlike elven officers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time after the Spellplague in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , the Iliyanbruen elves led by Merrisara formed New Sharandar, on either side of the Fey Crossing , the portal that connected the Neverwinter Wood to the Feywild. They reclaimed the ruins of Old Sharandar, the former capital of their once great home, and slew the dark fey that despoiled the land.</p>
<p>New Sharandar faced a grave threat circa the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , when the fomorian giant-king Malabog launched his war of conquest from his personal realm in the Feydark . Merrisara sent an emissary to the great city of Neverwinter , requesting aid from the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge and the Neverwinter Guard . She worked with the hero to help restore the destruction caused to New Sharandar by Malabog's dark fey minions, defeat some of the king's most malevolent allies, and finally scatter his army in a decisive battle in his own castle .</p>
