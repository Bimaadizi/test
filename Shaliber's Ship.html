<p>Shaliber's Ship was an inn within a semi-permanently moored merchant's cog located in Suzail , the capital of Cormyr , in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Ship was moored at Bolliver's Wharf , across the street where the Court Close reached the harbors of the Dragonmere in southern Suzail, on Silverscales Street . The inn stood about a city block away from The Black Rat to the northwest and The Osculatory a block to the northeast.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The floating leaky inn collected payments before the stay but asked no questions of its guests, whether guests brought swords , chained up captives, or came prepared for a brawl. The inn was a noisy place with commonly seen vermin. Still, it had its charm. Notably, the inn's staff tended to empty guests' chamberpots by splashing their contents off the gangplank just as Suzail's Purple Dragons showed up to investigate Shaliber's guests.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Shaliber's Ship was named after Shaliber , a captain who could not pay his debt to Maerun Stoutbold sometime before 1366 DR . Shaliber promised to one night sneak aboard the repossessed Ship and sail it into the sea, with all staff and guests aboard.</p>
<p>The inn received a favorable review from Volothamp Geddarm in his guidebook dedicated to Cormyr, published in the 1360s DR.</p>
