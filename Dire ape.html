<p>Dire apes , a type of dire animal , were a breed of unusually large and aggressive ape .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Resembling a huge and enraged gorilla , it was a huge feral-looking ape with a barrel-shaped chest, thick black fur, long arms ending in clawed hands, and a wide muzzle with big teeth. It was some 9 feet (2.7 meters) in height when standing upright and 800​ to ​1,200 pounds (360​ to ​540 kilograms) in weight; it was roughly the size of an ogre but much more muscular.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>They were encountered as solitary specimens or in companies of five to eight members. Highly territorial, a dire ape would attack anyone or anything that trespassed in its territory, including other dire apes.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>These creatures were talented climbers and had a keen sense of smell.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>A dire ape attacked first with its claws and teeth. If this failed, such as if the opponent was armored, it then tried to grab and hold them down. Either way, its claws dug in and tore through flesh, inflicting terrific injuries.</p>
