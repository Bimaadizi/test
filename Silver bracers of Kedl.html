<h2>History</h2>
<p>These Silver Bracers were crafted and enchanted by Kedl, who resided in the town of Phlan in the Moonsea North . Known for perfecting the technique that allowed him to wear three enchanted rings simultaneously, Kedl kept his polished bracers as a constant part of his fashionable outfit. Eventually, the man sold them to purchase more powerful magical rings. By the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , Silver Bracers of Kedl found their way into the hands of a conniving drow merchant Nym , who traded rare enchanted items deep in the Dorn's Deep in the Spine of the World .</p>
