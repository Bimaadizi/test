<p>Xovliax the Ravenous was a possessed deepspawn in Undermountain in 1375 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1363 DR , Xovliax claimed a section of the Melairbode as its lair but was soon possessed by the ghost of the Laird Besender Melairkyn . Somehow the possession became permanent and the personalities of the dwarf and of the deepspawn fused together.</p>
<p>So Xovliax started spawning dwarves in order to form a new dwarven community inside the dungeon, Murkstones . However, the spawned dwarves were a failure and often Xovliax sent them on suicide missions. Meanwhile, however, many dwarf outcasts and some duergar joined Murkstones.</p>
