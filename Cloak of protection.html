<p>A cloak of protection was a magic cloak that protected its wearer against attacks both physical and magical.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The cloak's magic worked by increasing the chances of attacks missing the wearer altogether. However, if an attack bypassed the cloak's protection, it was not dampened by it. It also slightly improved the wearer's ability to resist magical effects.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was thought that the original cloak of protection was designed by one of the earliest magic-user guilds on Toril . By the late 14 th century, cloaks of protection were of many designs, power levels, and makers, and were widespread throughout the Realms.</p>
