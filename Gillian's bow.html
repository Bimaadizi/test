<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Gillian's bow possessed a +2 enchantment. The weapon was also fitted with an ingenious sighting mechanism of gnomish creation.

<h2>History</h2>
<p>This enchanted bow faithfully served Gillian Cantilar, the half-elven ranger hero of the Trade Way. By 1372 DR , Gillian's bow was in the hands of Gillian's Hill Gang , a group of bandits who took over the fire cairn tower on the hill's summit and menaced the locals and traveling merchants.</p>
