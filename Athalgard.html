<p>Athalgard was a castle of Hastarl in Athalantar during the 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Athalgard's back battlements were close to the river, in the heart of Hastarl . It was not visible from Heldon .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The castle had a midden, and at least one tower that came down during the spell-battle in Year of the Chosen, 240 DR . The castle had a main gate, behind which it had a forecourt; the walls of the fortress were low enough that near buildings gave an angle of attack into the court, with only the main keep and armory towers rising higher still than those buildings.</p>
<p>The huge stables were lit only dimly.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>There was a royal library.</p>
<p>Ithboltar's spell-chamber in his tower had a window that looked out into the inner courtyard. Across the aforementioned courtyard, there was a balcony that looked into that chamber.</p>
<p>One tower was in use by Malanthor Drymm in 240Â DR ; there were jakes there, with a small window, and a large window facing a balcony.</p>
<p>One sewer connection led to the jakes in the quarters of Briost Elthauryn , those of two apprentices, and that of Alarashan Tlor .</p>
<p>There was a part of the castle set aside for the use of visiting nobility.</p>
<p>King Belaur had set aside two rooms for use as his bedchambers: one for sleeping, and another, more public, where he engaged in other activities with guests or concubines. That latter room had a path into the old castle, normally hidden behind a hanging portrait.</p>
<p>There were cellars.</p>
<p>The throne room had a set of steps leading up to the throne, high double doors, green carpet flanked by pillars, and a high encircling gallery. The walls had tapestries and banners.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>During the time of the Magelords of Athalantar , there was at least one gargoyle among the forces of Athalgard.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Chosen, 240 DR , Elminster Aumar , prince of Athalantar, took Athalgard by force, slaying the Magelords and his uncle, King Belaur Aumar. Rather than take over Athalantar, he yielded the crown upon Helm Stoneblade , a Knight of Athalantar.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Besides the magelords and the royal line, there were servants that worked in the palace.</p>
