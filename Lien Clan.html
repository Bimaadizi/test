<p>The Lien Clan was an illustrious Shou human clan based in Linshung in Hungtse Province , Shou Lung .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A member of the Lien Clan was a renowned Minister of Public Works under Emperor Hsiao Chin . Known for his forward-thinking and beloved for his kindness, he oversaw the construction of many roads and granaries, which raised the Lien CLan's profile.</p>
<p>His nephew, Lien Chen , was lord of Linshung circa Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) . As of that year, his 15-year-old daughter Lien Hua Liang displayed all the classic virtues for a Shou maiden: beautiful, devout, virtuous, talented, and obedient and respectful to her parents. Naturally, she was pursued by many young suitors, but Lord Chen gave impossible missions to all of them so she could not be separated from him.</p>
