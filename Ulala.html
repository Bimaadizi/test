<p>Ulala was a dustdigger and pet of the famed smith Jogaoh , protecting his home in the Sword Coast lands.</p>
<p>When Vajra Valmeyjar , Cybriana , Timoth Eyesbright , Onyx the Invincible , and Priam Agrivar sought out the smith in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , they sighted a pool of sparkling fresh water and rushed into it. They were soon ensnared by the dustdigger, which dropped the illusion and tried to devour them. Fortunately, Jogaoh called off his pet.</p>
