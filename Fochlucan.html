<p>The College of Fochlucan ( pronounced : /ˈ f oʊ x l uː k ɑː n / FOKH-loo-kan listen )—also spelled Foclucan , Focluchan , and Fochluchan —was a traditional bardic college in Silverymoon .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The reestablished college sought to restore the ancient Fochlucan bardic traditions. Most of the bards attending it studied the College of Lore and practiced its methods.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The main site of the college lay on the northeastern edge of Silverymoon .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The college was allied with the Harpers , but its master bards were always careful to keep their own mission separate from them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The College of Fochlucan was one of the seven elder bardic colleges, dating back to the legendary bard Falataer , who established it as the first level of his bardic college. The Fochlucan bandore , one of the Instruments of the Bards , was named after this college. It had been created by Falataer to test and reward his students who achieved mastery of the Fochlucan level of skill.</p>
<p>Following this tradition, bards studying to obtain the rank of Magna Alumnae attended all seven colleges, starting with Fochlucan before moving on to Mac-Fuirmidh . However, this practice was abandoned once the original colleges declined.</p>
<p>After the original college had closed its doors, it was later reopened as Utrumm's Music Conservatory , which was subsequently moved to Southbank . The unoccupied site was then reopened as the House of the Harp by master bard Forell Luekuan , who already envisioned reviving the original college's traditions and teachings. It soon became a member institution of the Conclave of Silverymoon .</p>
<p>After many years, with the support of the city of Silverymoon and the Harpers , the House of the Harp had recruited enough members with sufficient amassed knowledge to revive the original college and adopt the Fochlucan name again.</p>
