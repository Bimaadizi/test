<p>Fiertallin was a cosmetic commonly used in Ulgarth .</p>
<p>It was a white, chalky substance gathered from the river Xon and exported from the city of Suormpar to the rest of the realm.</p>
<p>Around 1367 DR , women of Ulgarth used fiertallin to add artistic streaks of white to their typically dark hair, as hair was a prime area of fashion. In the past, the king and princess of the neighboring realm of Doegan also bore similar streaks in their hair. [ speculation ]</p>
