<p>Eigeron was a ghost cloud giant sometime after the War of the Silver Marches .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Eigeron was the son of the cloud giant ruler Blagothkus . One day they went together to the Eye of the All-Father temple. The oracle told them that a great upheaval was in arrive and by then would arise an opportunity for giants to shine. The oracle however told also that Blagothkus never can impress the giant pantheon and urged to Eigeron to abandon Blagothkus. This triggered a fight between the two giants and in the end Blagothkus killed his son and departed mourning.
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR an adventuring party together with Harshnag entered in the temple. Eigeron rose as ghost questioning them and helping them in using the oracle.
However he could only find peace if someone killed his father.</p>
