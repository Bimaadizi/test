<p>QM III was a magical and quasimagical item shop that operated in the enclave of Eileanar until its destruction in 3520 NY (−339 DR) .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>QM III was found in the upper tiers of Karsus, almost at the center of the entire structure.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The QM business was owned by the arcanist Parzal the Outrageous . The store offered the most complete catalogue of magical items in all of Netheril , and had a total of seven locations spread between the enclaves.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The business came about when Parzal made a deal with Mortimar to jointly create a shop that would sell Parzal's autobiographical book, Parzal's Perils , as well as other magical goods such as material components . The success of the book meant that a total of seven stores were opened, with QM III in Karsus being the third. Parzal withdrew from operations while he wrote books, and Mortimar was left in charge.</p>
<p>This state of affairs was ended when Mortimar tricked Parzal into committing a high crime against a Karsite official, leading to Parzal faking his death and Mortimar gaining complete legal ownership of the company. Parzal eventually gained revenge via a cursed spell scroll , and the stricken Mortimar took the blame for Parzal's crime and allowed himself to be executed. Parzal then revealed himself as alive and accepted a 60-day imprisonment for faking his death, and the business was temporarily taken over by his close friend Archmeagan until he returned. After his release from prison Parzal went on a lengthy vacation outside of Netheril, resulting in him surviving the events of Karsus's Folly by sheer chance.</p>
