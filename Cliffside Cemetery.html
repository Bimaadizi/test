<p>The Cliffside Cemetery was the largest graveyard in Baldur's Gate , located in the Outer City district of Tumbledown , just west of Dusthawk Hill . It served as the final resting place for those Baldurians not wealthy or influential enough to be interred beneath an ancestral crypt or a temple of their choosing.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cliffside was composed of a labyrinthine network of headstones, tombs, sepulchers, and mausoleums, of varying size and grandeur. Collectively, it held the remains of a wide variety of individuals, from Baldurian citizens to wealthy merchants and even pirates.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>As of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the Gravemakers crew watched over the dead of Cliffside. They preserved their dignity by guarding them from grave-robbers, necromancers , and unscrupulous followers of Myrkul . Unfortunately, they were also forced to protect the city from undead as bodies were periodically raised, despite their best efforts.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Long before the 15 th century DR , the land the cemetery was built upon actually housed the estate of the wealthy Szarr merchant family. After their downfall, the family's estate was turned into a massive public graveyard.</p>
