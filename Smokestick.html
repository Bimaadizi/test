<p>A smokestick was a wooden stick treated with an alchemical substance that released a great deal of smoke when ignited. A smokestick would only burn for less than about ten seconds, but during that time, it created enough thick, black smoke to fill a volume of 1,000 cubic feet (28 cubic meters).</p>
<p>Smokesticks weighed about half a pound (200 grams) and sold for about 20 gold pieces in most markets.</p>
<p>During the decade of Spellplague , smokesticks were made out of alchemical clay and were priced around 150 gold pieces.</p>
