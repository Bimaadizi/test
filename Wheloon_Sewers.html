<p>The sewers of Wheloon and its drainage culverts were a set of constructions beneath the Cormyrean city of Wheloon and the later Wheloon Prison that served to dispose of water and waste.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the operation of the prison in the 15 th century DR , the Cormyrean Magistrates made deals with the local lizardmen like Salak , Tizzick , and Snake to explore, record, and guard the various hidden entrances and exits of the city, including the sewers. They also worked as guides for approved visitors who needed to sneak in and out of the prison.</p>
<p>The Wheloon Natives , based in the Harvest Hall above, had settlements in the drainage culverts, which they chose for their hidden location and defensibility. In addition to sheltering down there, they farmed mushrooms to help support their community. This arrangement worked quite well until the upheavals of the Shadovar invasion of Wheloon when the Troise gang, led by Porto , Aramiya , and Athea Troise , launched a huge attack upon the benign farmers. Many of the Natives were slain and their camps destroyed, though the Troise siblings and their gang were ultimately defeated before they achieved complete victory.</p>
<p>The Master Thief of the Night Brigade , Karissa the Knife , had an extensive series of rough tunnels delved beneath Wheloon. These tunnels connected a number of underground spaces together, including the sewers, allowing Karissa and her forces the ability to travel unseen about the city. It also served as the only entrance to the Master Thief's Hideout , and was well-fortified with traps . Using their own Wererat's Entrance , the Riverside Rats were able to access Karissa's tunnels and defeat her.</p>
