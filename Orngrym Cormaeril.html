<p>Orngrym Cormaeril was a member of the noble House Cormaeril of Cormyr in the first half of the 13 th century DR . He eventually became the head of the House and was granted the title of Duke for his service to King Dhalmass Obarskyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Off the battlefield, Orngrym was a somewhat effete man with black hair and a thin mustache. He had green eyes that did not reveal his emotions.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>On the battlefield, he found joy in the martial arts, even breaking into song when the fighting got intense. Despite his appearance, he had a lust for life and didn't shy away from experiencing it.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He was a fast and highly skilled swordsman that saved the King's life on multiple occasions. In his "retirement" years, he trained new knights and enjoyed hunting.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As a lesson to those involved, he once captured the flag from the top of a watchtower that was guarded by twenty soldiers. He did so single-handedly, non-lethaly, and unarmed.</p>
<p>For his service to the Crown, and particularly for protecting the King, Dhalmass made him a Duke. This was not a hereditary title for the Cormaeril family, but an honorary title for Orngrym while King Dhalmass lived. After the King's mysterious death in the Year of the Wall, 1227 DR , Orngrym retired and spend his remaining years training younger knights and hunting in the forest.</p>
<p>Orngrym was one of the last people to see Waevor's Wagon —a stolen pay-wagon carrying tens of thousands of silver pieces intended to pay the stipends of the Purple Dragons —before it disappeared into the night. As part of an escort convoy, he and a few other nobles were camping for the night when an enclosed wagon tore through the camp without lights or warning. After knocking aside Tharim Roaringhorn and Elbryn Scatterstars , it continued on its dangerous course and Orngrym mounted his horse and gave pursuit. He was unable to catch up to the carriage and lost its tracks in the dark. No trace of the guards (including two War Wizards ), horses, or the vehicle were ever found.</p>
