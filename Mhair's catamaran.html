<p>Mhair's catamaran was a personal watercraft operated by Mhair , an apathetic man who saved his passions for kayaking and cartography .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The catamaran was built from a pair of wooden kayaks rigged together with a platform across the middle. It had space for eight passengers plus Mhair himself, who pushed the boat along with a pole .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mhair used his catamaran to transport mind-controlled victims from the Sharran Temple of Mystra in Wheloon across the Wyvernflow river, so that they could be sent onwards to the Lost Refuge . The catamaran was kept in the secret underground boathouse beneath the temple, alongside the prison cells and Mhair's kayak . Mhair would take it through a short underground passage at night onto the river.</p>
<p>Prisoners who rode upon the boat included Dava , Tholwick Styles , Halish , Mendios , Durgen Glintstone , Kareem Hastith , Smote , and Zephan . The pirate Veera Wavecrest was likely rescued by adventurers before being forced across.</p>
