<p>Apothec was an ancient Netherese realm that prospered for a time until it was destroyed by the plagues of Moander .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The realm lay in southeast Netheril near the Desertsmouth Mountains , along the Pox River which flowed from Moander's Footstep .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Apothecs shared a common ancestry with the Netherese people, but eschewed the use of magic in favor of herbalism , medicine, and other more natural cures for ailments. They enjoyed good relations with the Netherese, and heavily traded with each other.</p>
<p>In 2105 NY (−1754 DR) , Moander tainted the Pox River with a lethal and virulent plague. The Apothecs were unable to resist it, and they were completely wiped out. Though they ceased to exist, the term " apothecary " came to be commonly used in the Realms for all those who made medicines and cures.</p>
