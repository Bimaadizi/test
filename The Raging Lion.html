<p>The Raging Lion was a large inn and tavern on the east side of the Trade Way in the north of Scornubel .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was well guarded and had secure stables. It was generally unclean throughout, and a dirty gilded lion stood outside. Sometimes the residents left a severed animal head in the lion's open jaws as a joke, and sometimes the heads of intelligent creatures were left there as a sinister message or warning. Inside, the chamberpots were also gilded lion heads. The staff of the establishment were known for being slow and leisurely.</p>
<h2>Patrons</h2>
<p>Three adventuring bands once made their home at The Raging Lion, but when one of them returned with great wealth looted from a Netherese ruin, the other two slaughtered them. The treasure remained undiscovered by 1366 DR .</p>
<h2>Food & Drink</h2>
<p>The food available included roasts, stews, and vegetables. Upon request, the chef would prepare a platter of fried stuffed snake in a poultry gravy with almonds, a personal favorite. Elturian pheasant tail soup was available but it was not unknown for rodents and other low-quality meat to be used instead. Wine and spiced wine was available to drink, but ale was not sold.</p>
