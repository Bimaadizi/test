<p>Sovereign glue was a strong magical adhesive.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A highly viscous, milky-white or amber substance, sovereign glue could only be stored in containers coated inside with oil of slipperiness . A container typically contained between one and seven ounces (0.02 to 0.2 liters), and one ounce could cover roughly a one-foot square (0.09 square meters). The substance gave off a strong transmutation aura.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Sovereign glue could permanently affix two objects to one another, creating a permanent and unbreakable adhesive bond. The substance took roughly a minute to set, during which time the objects could be separated and thereby nullifying the magical properties of the glue . If allowed to set, sovereign glue could only be broken through using universal solvent or oil of etherealness , or by employing a wish spell .</p>
