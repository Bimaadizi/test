<p>Deceiver genies were tasked djinn whose lives revolved around deception and illusion. Oddly enough, deceiver genies were more susceptible to believing illusions than most creatures.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The true form of a deceiver genie was difficult to ascertain because of the constant web of illusions surrounding them. Powerful sha'irs were needed to penetrate their true appearance.</p>
<p>In their natural form, deceiver genies were tall and gaunt. They had one blue eye and one brown. Their skin was a mottled grey color.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>These genies were cowards who were constantly surrounded by an illusionary effect similar to that of a displacer beast .</p>
<p>All deceiver genies could use the following spell-like abilities at will: change self , delude , false vision , tongues , misdirection , undetectable lie , whispering wind .</p>
<p>They could use the following abilities twice per day: distance distortion , massmorph , spectral force , shadow magic .</p>
<p>The following powers could be used once per day: disbelief , projected image , solipsism , sundazzle , and once per week they could use the following: mass suggestion , permanent illusion , programmed illusion , veil .</p>
<p>All illusions created by a deceiver genie could only be dispelled or defeated by extremely powerful archmages or their equivalent.</p>
<p>If forced into physical combat they could attack with their great strength and steel nails with raking attacks at their opponent’s eyes.</p>
<h2>Habitat/Society</h2>
<p>Deceiver genies would occasionally build, and hide, small communities within the desert. They were capable of lying even under any form of magical coercion.</p>
<p>If given idle time, a deceiver genie would concoct ways of making life miserable for their master. They viewed the entire world as a blank canvass on which they could paint their lies and deceptions.</p>
<p>Though they did not care about wealth, deceiver genies were fascinated by all forms of art. Because of this they would never harm artists, including bards .</p>
<p>Their utterly unpredictable nature and high intelligence made them at least as dangerous as slayer genies .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>These genies served the noble djinn or, in rare instances, a powerful janni . Binding a deceiver genie to servitude was a dangerous affair as the genie usually appealed to their master’s servants to betray them.</p>
