<p>Cymmarraa was a wizard between the late 14 th and late 15 th centuries DR . Going by the moniker "Lady of Ghosts", she pursued a grudge against Elminster and Manshoon both.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was violent, driven by vengeance, and given to dramatic speech.</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>She was tall and slender, with very long legs, dark eyes, and a sharp-featured face. She was quite gorgeous, and a dagger's point stuck out from between her breasts.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Among her abilities, whether by spell or item, she was capable of casting a spell that strongly resembled invisibility , another that made a door explode into splinters ahead of her, and another that paralyzed an enemy mage, likely a variant on hold person . She also knew a spell to ream and absorb minds, probably akin to crawling subsumption , and had some ability to make heads explode, likely with a spell as well. More notably, she was quite deft in hand-to-hand combat.</p>
<p>She also bore a curse that prevented her from dying at Manshoon 's hands, but she judged would twist itself if she ever removed the dagger he'd struck her down with. By whatever means, she was able to endure barrages of sorcery, probably through a spell.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>She wore mostly black, including a jerkin, with a silver weathercloak on top. She kept a dagger through her chest at all times.</p>
<p>After slaying Sarrak, she sifted through Harkuldragon's possessions to take all their magic items. She also carried a sword, on which she used poison.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She was once Manshoon's apprentice and lover. Both her mother and her two sisters had been, in turn, also his apprentices and lovers.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>She was hunting down blueflame items to lure out Manshoon.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Cymmarra apprenticed under Manshoon a long time prior, before he backstabbed her. During that time, he sought blueflame items . At one point, Manshoon sent her mother, and her two sisters, against the Chosen of Mystra , Elminster ; they died in the fight, and Manshoon did not help them. Cymmarra was outraged enough that she attacked him; he struck a dagger into her back in response, and left her for dead. Unknown to him, Elminster had previously cast a spell on Cymmarra that would prevent her death. She believed that the spell was meant for him to be able to draw information on Manshoon from her mind, rather than as a mercy; in either case, the dagger remained in her chest, leaving her in constant agony, and she swore vengeance on Manshoon and Elminster both, seeking blueflame items to lure out Manshoon.</p>
<p>In the wake of the disastrous Council of the Dragon of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , after Marlin Stormserpent fled to the Windstag hunting lodge, he was soon attacked by Cymmarra, who wielded two other blueflame ghosts . Her blueflame ghosts badly injured him; while talking to him, he died. After the Marchioness Immerdusk , Storm Silverhand , managed to get Lord Calantar 's blueflame belt buckle at the Bold Blazon during the Festival of Handras , Cymmarra tracked her down through Castle Obarskyr with her ghosts in tow, and then into the Dalestride Portal . Along the way she endured a barrage of spells from the War Wizards without even slowing down, and then attempted to counterattack, aiming a spell at King Foril Obarskyr I ; only the attack by Larak Dardulkyn , suddenly teleporting in, stopped her spell.</p>
<p>At the cave in Shadowdale where Storm had headed to restore The Simbul , she broke through a number of wards, before she was attacked again by a pursuing Dardulkyn; she struck him with a poisoned sword. She quickly determined that a young noble in the cave, Arclath Delcastle , was the host of Elminster , and that the man that attacked her, Larak Dardulkyn, was actually Manshoon; she moved to kill Arclath, who had collapsed after he cast a spell to stop her ghosts. He got up immediately, and sliced off her fingers, parrying competently. A restored Simbul soon arrived and, after restoring Elminster's body, turned Cymmarra to dust in an instant, biding her to rest.</p>
