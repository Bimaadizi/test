<p>Merrow were undersea merfolk -like monsters from the Abyss who terrorized the waters.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Merrow on the Material Plane lived in undersea caves. They filled their abodes with treasures and used the rotted corpses of dead creatures tied to kelp to mark their territory.</p>
<p>Demogorgon often sent his merrow to the Material Plane to bully life there.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>A merrow was often armed with a harpoon. It also fought with its sharp claws and its fanged bite.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Merrow were said to have been created when a tribe of merfolk found an idol to Demogorgon that drove them all insane. The king of this tribe demanded a blood sacrifice to the idol that opened a rift to the Abyss. The corrupted merfolk slowly transformed into the monsters now known as merrow over multiple generations there.</p>
