<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Hethcanter family descended from Hethcanter , the mage . However, there were supposedly unrelated Hethcanter families in Sembia , Tsurlagol , and Telflamm . One notable member of the family was Lord Oratham Hethcanter , the garrison commander of High Horn who was active during the rule of King Rhigaerd Obarskyr II that ended in the Year of the Snow Winds, 1335 DR . In the 14 th century DR , the Hethcanter family had three royal knights that battled alongside Cormyr's Purple Dragons . As of the late 15 th century DR, the Lady of Graces Brunzarra and Ildra Hethcanter were family's representatives in the Court of Cormyr, alongside Lyrele Hethcanter who served the crown in a clandestine manner. Paresper Hethcanter of Immersea ended his successful adventuring career, and in the late 15 th century DR, he purchased a share in the ownership of the fortified Nightgate Inn in the capital. Paresper's father, Rharvuld Hethcanter was a renowned furniture maker whose craft was in high demand in Suzail.</p>
