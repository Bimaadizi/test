<p>Bulzo Tarhair was a master thief who lived in the city of Tyraturos , within the tharch of the same name , in Thay during the mid-14 th century DR . He was a knowledgeable older rogue, who possessed at least a little bit of information about the most of the important personalities of southern Thay and had very strong opinions about the nations lack of laws.</p>

<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The slightly older thief had a strong fascination with adventurers and their lifestyle. He regularly offered his services to aid any adventurers he met throughout his travels, and genuinely helped their endeavors. However, he always left with a small memento from them, in addition to any payment offered, as a reminder of the experience.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to his career in crime, Bulzo spent time as an adventurer, and went on a number of expeditions with the tharchion of Pyarados , Valerios Theokillos .</p>
