<p>Savant Sandrew , usually know as Sandrew the Wise , was the leading cleric of Oghma in Waterdeep in 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sandrew hailed from the Silver Marches and in 1358 DR he was working at the Halls of Inspiration in Silverymoon .</p>
<p>He later settled in Waterdeep, circa 1362 DR , with the objective of building a temple and a library worthy of his god and the City of Splendors. As part of this effort he recruited many clerics from his former temple.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , on the 17 th and 18 th of Eleint, Sandrew was officiating the wedding ceremony between the Open Lord of Waterdeep Piergeiron the Paladinson and Eidola of Neverwinter . The event was swept away by a whirlwind of sinister plots around the wedding.</p>
<p>He was later one of four clerics of Oghma among the many powerful mages that Khelben Arunsun brought together in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , in order to cleanse part of the High Moor and restore Faer'tel'miir , a lost city of Miyeritar .</p>
