<p>Arleosa Starhenge was a tavern owner in Amphail sometime after the War of the Silver Marches in the Year of the Iron Dwarf's Vengeance, 1485 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR , she was the proprietor of the Stag-Horned Flagon , a tavern in the village of Amphail. She had a magic ring made of wood and carved with cavorting nymphs . She was told that it would provide aid or advice if she spoke the name of its creator into the ring, but she never availed herself of this boon.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Arleosa knew Miros Xelbrin from her years with a traveling carnival and they were still friends into retirement.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Arleosa was of Chondathan descent, born in an area infused with wild magic which apparently gave her a shapechanging ability. This ability led her to join a carnival and she traveled widely for many years. In the late 1480s or early 1490s, she settled in Amphail where she bought the Stag-Horned Flagon tavern and worked as a tavernmaster. No one in Amphail knew of her magical nature and she did not use her ability any more, having retired from that life.</p>
