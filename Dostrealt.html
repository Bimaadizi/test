<p>Dostrealt was a drow wizard and captain of the flitter Erevan's Clutch .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The mage wore green wizard's robes . He was completely blind.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Dostrealt relied mostly on his exceptional hearing to move around and interact with his environment. As a result of his disability, he was unable to climb walls and hide in the shadows with the typical ease that was common to most drow. However, his blindness conferred him several advantages. He was not negatively affected by sunlight like other drow, and he was also immune to spells and magical effects that required the target to see the attacker, such as a medusa 's petrifying stare.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Dostrealt owned two spellbooks , both written in a script of raised dots and dashes rather than magical ink . The elf could read his books by running his fingers over the writings.</p>
<p>His primary spellbook consisted exclusively of spells that did not require line of sight, such as Caligarde's claw , decastave , dispel silence , ghost pipes , ironguard , know school , paralyze , Quimby's enchanting gourmet , secure , skull watch , spelltrap , spell engine , Spendelarde's chaser , and sunburst . It also contained the unique spells Snilloc's heat-seeking snowball and Snilloc's heat-seeking major missile , which were modifications developed by Dostrealt himself so they could be cast without visual contact. His second spellbook contained a more general assortment of common spells.</p>
<p>The wizard also carried a rod of blind walking and a ring of protection , as well as a piccolo and a flute .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dostrealt was originally part of the crew of a drow armada . The ship encountered a neogi mindspider and, in the ensuing fight, a mage from the opponent ship targeted the armada's crew with a curse . Unable to dodge the spell, Dostrealt fell victim to the curse, which consisted of an invisible quasit that constantly worked mischief against everyone around, except for Dostrealt himself. After failed attempts at removing the curse, Dostrealt exiled himself aboard the flitter and left the armada to protect his crew.</p>
<p>Since the curse had materialized itself in the form of a creature, spells such as remove curse were ineffective against it. The only way to remove he curse was if a non-drow accepted Dostrealt as a friend, and said so out loud.</p>
<p>After abandoning his mothership, Dostrealt drifted for an unknown amount of time in Realmspace , until falling unconscious as a result of the rapidly decaying quality of his ship's air envelope .</p>
