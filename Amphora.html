<p>Amphoras ( or : amphorae ) were a jar -type of storage vessel found in both the Realms and the distant world of Theros , typically used to hold wine .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Amphoras had narrow necks and two handles. They were often made of clay.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The existence of amphoras on Toril dated as far back as the ancient kingdoms of the Raurin and the Netherese Empire . The Raurin ruler Khamsa kept one within the treasury of his temple , sealed by wax and housing over five hundred gemstones of varied sizes.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Morningstar, 1350 DR , a group of adventurers known as the Heroes of Phlan ventured through a pool of darkness situated above the Elven Court and came out upon the corpse of Moander in the Astral Plane . While traveling through Moander's hair the Heroes of Phlan rescued a female cleric from the Cult of Moander , who were planning to sacrifice her as an offering to their deity. Grateful for her rescue, the priestess informed the Heroes of Phlan that while running from the cultists she had dropped an amphora containing a substance that would slow the dead god's heartbeat if thrown down his mouth.</p>
<p>Around 1372 DR the sale of osssra was banned by the Lords of Waterdeep following the discovery that they had been used to murder three members of House Thorp . This caused issues of pricing to arise between Phalantar Orivan and House Sultlue , who had long been supplied with the oil by the merchant; he sought to triple his asking price, while House Sultlue only wished to pay double and only for any future shipments. While they worked through these negotiations, Phalantar kept his stock of osssra in thirty-five small amphoras within a storeroom that had once belonged to Artor Morlin .</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>On the Upper Planes , some evil fishermen were known to enspell amphorae with darkness so they could capture asrai and sell them to creatures of the Lower Planes , such as hydroloths , marraenoloths , and slaadi .</p>
