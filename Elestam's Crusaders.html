<p>Elestam's Crusaders were an adventuring troupe based in Erlkazar in the Lands of Intrigue in the mid-14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The group was led by Korox Morkann , the duke of Elestam 's son, and included his four close friends.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>When active, the group defended against assassination attempts and against vampires and dragons .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Elestam's Crusaders were allied with the Emerald Brotherhood , until that group's mysterious disappearance in the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The group was named for the Duchy of Elestam, which was the former name of Erlkazar, before it seceded from Tethyr . During the reign of then duke Valon Morkann , the so-called Duke of Dusk from the neighboring duchy plotted with several counts and barons of Elestam to overthrow and assassinate Duke Morkann. The Crusaders were formed to defend the duke, and they successfully stopped no fewer than four attempts to murder Duke Morkann, though they never were able to link the assassination attempts definitively back to the Duke of Dusk.</p>
<p>After the chaos of the Ten Black Days of Eleint , the people of Elestam overcame the power of the rival counts and barons and asked the duke to rule as their king. When Elestam then severed ties with Tethyr and became the monarchy of Erlkazar, the Crusaders continued to defend the fledgling nation from evil within and without.</p>
<p>In 1358 DR , the goblins of the Starrock tribe of the Kuldin Peaks and the High Peaks assaulted Erlkazar, in a seige of Duhlnarim that lasted for three months. Ultimately, the Crusaders formed an unexpected alliance with a group of ogre mercenaries from Rivenshield called the Shieldbreakers . King Ertyk Uhl of the goblins was defeated by the year's end, but the elven husband of one of the Crusaders— Rysodyl Boughstrong , who was married to Laxaella Bronshield —was slain by the goblins.</p>
<p>The party disbanded in the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR , when Korox succeeded his father as king of Erlkazar. The new king reluctantly took on his new role, preferring his life in the Crusaders to that of ruling a kingdom. The other four members were also promoted to positions as rulers of the other four baronies.</p>
