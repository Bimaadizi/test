<p>The Black Mask was a tavern that operated in Arabel during the midâ€“14 th century DR . It was considered among the most popular establishments in the city.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , a mage created a bright sphere of light in front of the black mask and inadvertently trapped himself within. Business at the tavern soared over the course of the following week as other mages tried to free the trapped individual and onlookers came to gawk at the disturbing incident. The poor trapped mage died of thirst at the end of that week's time.</p>
