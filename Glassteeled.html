<p>A glassteeled item was any object granted steel-like durability by the glassteel spell.</p>
<h2>Differences with Glassteel</h2>
<p>While a material known as glassteel existed, there were numerous examples of objects that rather than having been created out of glassteel, had been treated with a hardening spell known as glassteel (or even Trobriand's glassteel ) instead. While objects made of glassteel varied in appearance, objects with a glassteel treatment generally remained visually recognizable as their base material. Also, glassteel had the strength of adamantine , though not its ability to damage other materials, and the lightness mithral ; glassteel -treated creations were explicitly only as strong as steel.</p>
<h2>Applicable Materials</h2>
<p>While glass itself was the most common obvious of glassteel spells, it was not the only material susceptible to such reinforcement. Crystals, too, could be affected by the spell and obscure versions, such as Trobriand's glassteel may have lacked even those limitations. In fact, even the metal adamant was affected by the magic, and equipment made of such had been enchanted successfully.</p>
<h2>Notable Examples in the Realms</h2>
<h2>Tinted Glassteel</h2>
<p>A very specific case, tinted glassteel was created by the arcane and sold to spacefaring drow . The spell was modified so that the object, rather than transparent, was only partially transparent from one side, and resembled steel from the other. A helmet of light-seeing , which made light bearable to drow eyes, required this material.</p>
