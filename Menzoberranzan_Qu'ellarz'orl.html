<p>Qu'ellarz'orl , also The Place of the Nobles or the House loft , was a high plateau and district in the drow city of Menzoberranzan . It was home to some of the most powerful drow houses in the city, including House Baenre , the most powerful house. Qu'ellarz'orl and Tier Breche combined were considered the "two heads" (most important unifying parts) of Menzoberranzan.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The plateau was located in the southwestern corner of the city and was screened from the rest of the city by a forest of giant mushrooms. On the other side of the forest was the wealthy district of Narbondellyn .</p>
<p>There were nine tunnels between Lake Donigarten and the edge of the Qu'ellarz'orl plateau.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In contrast to the rest of the city, Qu'ellarz'orl was spacious and bare; no crowds were found here, nor any businesses.</p>
