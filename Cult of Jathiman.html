<p>The Cult of Jathiman , also called the Jathimites , were an ancient cult of Netherese origin. They hated all the gods and their works, and were most known for crafting the Jathiman Dagger .</p>
<h2>Dogma</h2>
<p>The Jathimites bore an intense hatred of deities and all aspects of the divine. They believed that, through sheer brute force, mortals could even bring down and kill the gods.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By weaving arcane magic through violent self-destruction—in the actual self-sacrifice of thirty-nine Jathimites—they manifested these forces in physical form, crafting the Jathiman Dagger . It was designed to slay the gods themselves.</p>
<p>They would not get to savor their creation for long. The god Jergal , Lord of the End of Everything, caused the slaughter of the whole surviving sect in grisly fashion. He trapped the remaining 149 Jathimites in a great coliseum where he slowly imploded and then reanimated them as ghouls who would devour the others, and forced them to watch each other's fates in horror and hunger. Afterward, he took the Jathiman Dagger for himself.</p>
