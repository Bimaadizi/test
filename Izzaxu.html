<p>Izzaxu was a dreadful creature of flames forged out of fire elementals by the drow who was bound to the ancient Kiln behind the vault door in the Forlorn Cliffs of the Middledark .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Izzaxu appeared as a floating helmed skeletal construct -like creature that lacked its lower half. Engulfed in roaring flames, it wielded two sabers .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Izzaxu had access to a variety of fire-based spells and abilities, such as burning hands , flame whirl (Izzaxu whirled around in a twister of flames and blades damaging everyone around), overheat (the very air around the creature heated up attempting to incinerate everyone around). Izzaxu could channel the energies of the Elemental Plane of Fire to cause an explosive wave of flames centered on itself. It was also immune to all mundane and magical fire.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Izzaxu resided inside the secure magical vault that came to be known as Izzaxu's Kiln, the ancient abandoned site of countless drow summoning rituals. The masters of the site dabbled in conjuration and created the creature using fire elementals. Eventually the drow left Izzaxu's Kiln, bounding the flaming creature to the summoning chamber.</p>
<p>Eventually, the vault was discovered by Torga Burduum and her group of dwarves searching for the means of creating powerful weaponry. Reaching the ancient Kiln, she uncovered magic texts describing a creature called Izzaxu. Foolishly, Toga and her group broke the seals that were holding the elemental monster, thinking they would be able to control the creature. Izzaxu was too powerful for the dwarves and incinerated the dwarves as it exited the portal. Those who avoided the infernal flames fled through the caves, triggering the traps left behind by the drow, and met their doom after being trapped inside Izzaxu's Kiln.</p>
<p>Circa 1490 DR , Izzaxu's Kiln was unsealed by the Champion of the Burning Dawn. The Kiln was teeming with creatures summoned by the drow traps triggered by the fleeing dwarfs. The Champion and the companions fought through hezrous , quasits , dretches , and blazing skeletons before reaching the ghostly dwarves of Torga Burduum's group. Agreeing to free her from the cursed undead existence, the champion challenged Izzaxu, destroying the creature. Torga channeled Izzaxu's flames and essence to create her greatest work— Torga's Pyre . She gifted the enchanted sword to the Champion and departed for the afterlife.</p>
