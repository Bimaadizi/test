<p>Crag cats , sometimes called "Hunters-of-Men" , were predators that were well adapted to almost all terrains.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Crag cats were grey during most of the year, but they turned white during the winter to better hide in the snow.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>The cry of a crag cat resembled a scream of terror in order to attract humans.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Crag cats had extraordinary resistance to magic and were capable of reflecting spells back to their casters.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Crag cats were well adapted to any terrain, except for dense forests. They were often solitary, but could also be found in packs and family groups with their cubs. These packs were particularly dangerous during harsh winters.</p>
