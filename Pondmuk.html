<p>Pondmuk was a goblin member of the Legion of the Chimera in the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , the town of Targos in Icewind Dale became besieged by the Legion of the Chimera. One of the Legion's surprise attacks involved teleporting goblins from underground tunnels into the Targos docks. The next attack came as a direct assault on the town's palisades. Lord Ulbrec Dinnesmore of Targos ordered a group of mercenaries from Luskan to follow two of his scouts, Ennelia and Braston , southeast to the goblin fortress. Vunarg and his tribe resided in the recently erected fort in the frigid Icewind Dale tundra.</p>
<p>Pondmuk, and his tribe, under the leadership of Chief Ogrok , was among many goblins who used the caverns underneath the fortress during the Legion's war with the Ten Towns. Goblins and Pondmuk, in particular, were bullied by the Legion's orcs and deprived of food. When Lord Ulbrec's mercenaries infiltrated the fortress, Pondmuk showed no hostility towards them and only asked for their help – to bring him big fat corpses of delicious giant spiders to eat. Pondmuk offered information on the Legion and the fortress in exchange for the spider corpses. He also stated the password to get into the hobgoblin part of the fortress – "chimera."</p>
