<p>Fort Nyanzaru was a defensive fortress built to protect Port Nyanzaru against attackers from the Bay of Chult .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The fort was located in the Harbor Ward at the mouth of the harbor itself. The city's lighthouse lay on the immediate other side of the harbor entrance.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>From the battlements atop the fort, the whole of the Harbor Ward was clearly visible. Meanwhile, a dungeon beneath the fort was used by the merchant princes to store important or cursed treasure.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The fort was armed with two ballistae designed to launch heavy bolts, explosive-tipped bolts, and cannisters of alchemist's fire .</p>
<p>A massive iron chain spanned the mouth of the harbor between the fort and the lighthouse. A winch in the fort could raise this chain to completely both access into or out of the harbor. This was raised when the harbor came under attack or when criminals attempted to flee the Harbor Ward by ship. In addition, alarm bells were sounded within the fort whenever pirates approached the port.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The harbor of Port Nyanzaru was built explicitly with defense in mind. As of the late 15 th century DR , it had been several decades since the fort had needed to raise the chain to defend the harbor from an attack.</p>
<p>When Port Nyanzaru came under attack by the fiendish pirate Idrianne Smoke during the events of the death curse , the merchant prince Ekene-Afa ordered the fort to bombard her flagship, the Banshee .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , the fort was occupied by mercenaries loyal to the merchant princes. The garrison consisted of forty guards led by four officers and a castellan . The captain of the guard was Uponga Naodha .</p>
