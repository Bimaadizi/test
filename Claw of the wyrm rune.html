<p>The claw of the wyrm rune was a rare magical dragon 's claw that had been coated with molten silver and inscribed with the giant rune wyrm .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Three times a day, wielders of this claw could point it at any dragon within 20 feet (6.1 meters) of them and those of weak will would be rendered temporarily vulnerable to all forms of damage. The claw also granted its bearers a resistance to the breath weapon of any dragon.</p>
<p>Additionally, the wielder could permanently affix the claw's magic to an area by drawing a wyrm rune in the desired location. The process was lengthy, taking up to eight hours, and required the claw to be within 5 feet (1.5 meters) of the rune. Once complete, the claw would be shattered beyond repair and any dragons that wandered within 100 feet (30 meters) of the rune would feel a heavy weight forcing them to fly no higher than 10 feet (3 meters).</p>
