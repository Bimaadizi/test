<p>Amek was a tiefling of Elturel was exiled from his home city in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Amek had purple-black skin and two large horns that extended nearly straight upwards. He dressed in simple clothing.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Like other Elturian tieflings, Amek was kicked out of the holy capital of Elturgard following the event known as the Descent , where it was briefly transported to Avernus in the Nine Hells during the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . Amek joined the group of tieflings headed west along the Risen Road towards Baldur's Gate , but were then forced to seek aid from the druids of Emerald Grove or risk death by goblinoid attack.</p>
<p>As tension grew between the druids and their new tiefling neighbors, Amek became aggrieved at the perceived lack of concern for his people's well-being. These feeling intensified as acting head druid Kagha prepared the Rite of Thorns to kick the tieflings out and keep hidden the grove from others on the Sword Coast .</p>
