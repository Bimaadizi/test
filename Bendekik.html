<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bendekik was the high priest of the city until 1371 DR , the year of a drow attack. Bendekik remained in the city and made a curse that no drow be able to use the power of the earth. During the fighting, he killed seven drow warriors before he died.</p>
<p>In 1479 DR , his assistant Pingtu was back in the city and was the new head priest. Bendekik somehow manifested to him and explained how to end the curse. With the help of an adventuring party hired by Kargien Dissengulp , Pingtu followed the instructions and the curse disappeared.</p>
