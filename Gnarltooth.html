<p>Gnarltooth was the chieftain of a marauding ettin tribe who preyed on gnome settlements sometime before 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gnarltooth's notoriety, the footnote in history, came from his tribe attacking gnome settlements sometime before 1372 DR. One of the towns targeted by him was the home of Elbix , a gnome conjurer who famously owned a rod of "great power." The town's leader summoned him to obliterate Gnarltooth and the ettins via the awesome powers of Elbix's Stonestick . The terrified gnome met Gnarltooth on the battlefield, ready to be killed by the monster. Instead, the ettin snatched Elbix to take a closer look and received an accidental poke in the eye from the "mighty" rod. The ettin chieftain stumbled backwards and impaled himself on his own spear , ending his marauding career. The remaining ettins fled without their leader.</p>
