<p>Mortimar was an arcanist of ancient Netheril who lived in the enclave of Eileanar until his execution in 3520 NY (−339 DR) .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mortimar first came across Parzal the Outrageous when he bought his autobiographical book, Parzal's Perils , and immediately saw the potential in the foreign mage. Together they founded a business that sold Parzal's books as well as material components and other magical reagents, which found rapid success and eventually came to dominate the quasimagical item market, including the QM III shop in the Karsus Enclave. Seeking more than co-ownership, Mortimar manipulated and tricked Parzal into accepting a job that had him perform a horrid curse upon a target, only for it to be revealed that the injured party was a government official of Eileanar, a crime punishable by death . In order to "help" Parzal escape the law, Mortimar faked Parzal's death using a corpse and a broken amulet of life protection , and took full ownership of the company they had founded.</p>
<p>Unable to contain his glee upon the completion of his plan, Mortimar gloated to Parzal's face and told him exactly what he had done. Parzal responded by fleeing, then created Parzal's revenge , a powerful curse disguised as a constitution-enhancing scroll . He then returned to the shop in the guise of an uneducated fighter , and offered to sell the unidentified scroll to Mortimar. Having recently lost some of his life-force in the crafting of a powerful magic item, Mortimar was eager to take advantage of the poor warrior, and paid a mere 50 gold pieces for the invaluable scroll. His joyous scamming turned to horror when he used the cursed scroll, and he was reduced to a shell of his former self. While he was incapacitated, Parzal's close friend Archmeagan took over the operation of the business.</p>
<p>Seeking a release from his torturous state, Mortimar falsely confessed to Parzal's crime, allowing himself to be executed by Eileanar's justice system. With his foe gone and his name cleared, Parzal publicly revealed himself and suffered a 60-day imprisonment for the crime of faking his death, then went on vacation.</p>
