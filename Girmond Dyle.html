Only one last piece of the scroll remained, lying in the hands of the Netherese forces occupying Granwell Keep within the Blooded Wood . Taking the pieces that the party had assembled for safekeeping, he sent them to recover the last pieces from the Netherese. However, he was shortly after discovered by the Netherese forces, who killed him, claimed the pieces of the Nether Scroll for themselves, and put his corpse on display for the Cormyrean forces to find at the entrance of the keep.</p>
