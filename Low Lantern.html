<p>The Low Lantern was a converted three-mast ship, the Low Lantern , used as a festhall, tavern, and gambling house in Baldur's Gate . It was often used as a place for covert meetings.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Around 1366 DR , the Low Lantern cruised around the harbor of Baldur's Gate at night, but by 1482 DR it stayed at its mooring permanently.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Low Lantern was once a well-kept seafaring vessel but by 1482 DR it was listing to one side and leaked often. The ship had three masts.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>There were at least three levels below the upper deck. The first two decks were filled with bars and gambling tables. The lowest deck was split into small rooms that were available to rent. These rooms were often used by courtesans . By 1482 DR, leaks were a regular occurrence in the ship.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>While it was quiet during daytime hours, the Low Lantern was often rowdy and loud, but also quite fun during the night. Parties were held on both the upper deck and the lower decks.</p>
<p>There was an unspoken rule among the regular patrons regarding outsiders: don't pull a weapon unless they draw first.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Low Lantern offered drinks, gambling, and rooms to rent. Courtesans also offered their services there.</p>
<p>The drinks served at the Low Lantern were said to be some of the most expensive on the Sword Coast . Drinks available around 1368 DR included Westgate Ruby , Suz-ale , Old One Eye , Dragon's Breath Beer , Luiren's Best , Shadowdark ale , and Bitter Black .</p>
<p>For a fee, special parties in the rigging and sail booms could be arranged. For some adventurous customers, wedding nights were celebrated whilst up in the rigging or suspended over the waves from ropes and sail booms.</p>
<h2>Staff</h2>
<p>Around 1368 DR , the Low Lantern was owned by Lobar . Around 1482 DR, it was owned by Laraelra Thundreth .</p>
<p>The workers at the Low Lantern were known as the "crew" and they were made up of ex-pirates. As well as serving the patrons, the crew also quelled large brawls and prevented fires. While the bouncers for the Lantern were humans , Laraelra employed two kenku to tend the bar.</p>
<h2>Patrons</h2>
<p>The patrons of the Low Lantern were largely thugs, rogues, pirates, and the poorer citizens of Baldur's Gate. The Low Lantern was also popular with halflings .</p>
<p>Circa 1368 DR, some patrons of the Low Lantern included Yago , Desreta , and Vay-ya . As of 1492 DR, visitors of the Lantern included the thug Grimboot , the sailor Hitoshi Jade , and the dastardly nobleman Amrik Vanthampur .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Some people believed that Laraelra Thundreth worked for the Guild . Despite their suspicions, the crew of the Low Lantern would adamantly deny these rumors.</p>
