<p>Darkened Glory was a magical katana from Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Once a graceful blade, Darkened Glory was tainted by dark magic. It had a light blue pommel and guard, while the blade itself was nearly black in appearance. It also had a keen edge that could deal tremendous damage to the nemies.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The katana was enchanted to occasionally curse struck enemies.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Darkened Glory originally belonged to a young Kara-Turan officer guarding the caravan of a diplomatic envoy. When the caravan was ambushed by yuan-ti raiders, the officer was almost immediately the only guard left standing. She defended a single wagon from several waves of yuan-ti attackers but was ultimately overpowered by their leader. In awe of her skill, the yuan-ti leader recovered her katana. It was later enchanted by a high priest of Sseth .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , Darkened Glory was in the hands of the yuan-ti servants of marilith Yxunomei , who laired in the Dragon's Eye on the Spine of the World . After the fiend was slain by the Heroes of Icewind Dale , the sword changed owners, eventually ending up in the hands of the Underdark mercenaries who worked for Grimbold Tornhelm in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , raiding the termalaine gem mines of Tourmaline in Icewind Dale .</p>
