<p>Izwae was a drow mercenary who accompanied Dhourn Ba'Tol during his search for the legendary Adamantine Forge .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The drow wizard Dhourn Ba'Tol vowed to share his fortune with a group of drow mercenaries in exchange for protection if they find the Adamantine Forge. The group consisted of Arcagh , Artimezt , Izwae, Moy and Tecothy .</p>
<p>However, Dhourn's rival Xargrim sought to find the Forge first and once met Dhourn. The rivals were both planning an ambush against each other, but began to talk of a pact, ultimately arguing until their words turned to screams. Xargrim summoned an unusual spectator adept at petrification and fled. Dhourn and his companions were all petrified for so long that Dhourn's memory shard faded.</p>
