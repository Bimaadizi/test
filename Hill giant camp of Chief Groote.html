<p>The hill giant camp of Chief Groote was a broad hill giant steading, situated high in the Ice Spires mountain range of northwest Faerûn , that was ruled over by the chieftain Groote in the mid to late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This steading was situated in the rolling foothills of the northern Ice Spires, southeast of the Eternal Blizzard . Its largest portion stood atop four hills, overlooking a small valley that stood between it and the valley of Hartsvale .</p>
<p>Cutting between those four hills was an icy stream, which issued from a lake higher up in the Ice Spires. At the center of this steading the stream was dammed, forming a shallow pool ( 7 on the map) that acted as a water supply and a source of amusement. For a half of every year the stream and its pool were frozen solid. During these months the residents would obtain water by chopping out blocks of ice from the stream and carry them into their smokehouses to melt.</p>
<p>Outside of the camp was large pit ( 4 on the map) leading into an underground network of tunnels that connected to an arm of the Underdark . Long before the 14 th century DR, the passage connecting to the Underdark was sealed off by the residents, who then converted the rest of the network into a storage space.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This steading's superstructures consisted of seven smokehouses and a building that doubled as a barn and slaughterhouse, which were all connected by large fortified walls. All of these were constructed of piled rocks, cemented together by a thick paste the resident giants had drawn from animal fat. Their rooves, as well as catwalks along the fortified walls that connected them, were sloppily hewn from the wood of coniferous tree species. The main gate into the steading ( 6 on the map) always had at least two hill giants on guard duty and featured holes through which they could pour boiling oil upon intruders.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The people of this steading were lead by a storkokk ("master eater" in Jotunhaug ), equivalent to what was known in Common as a chief . They were the largest and most voracious person in the steading. Other residents looked to them for political and spiritual leadership, as well as inspiration in regards to cooking and eating. Above the authority of this storkokk was the grand ruler of the Ice Spires's hill giant tribes, whom the steading swore fealty to.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Life in this steading was typical of hill giant steadings in the Ice Spires. It was a rather loose and unregimented life, but there were six categories of responsibility that the hill giants divided themselves into based upon their race's beliefs regarding the Ordning .</p>
<h3>Grand Feast</h3>
<p>Whenever one of the steading's gluttons found their foodstores to be overstuffed they would declare a grand feast to celebrate. During such an event the residents would gather around the steading's enormous fire pit and engage in notorious degrees of unrestrained revelry. They often concluded with most residents dozing away or being heavily intoxicated. Often important guests of honor from outside the tribe were asked to visit the steading to take part in one of these, though most such visitors excused themselves long before the grand feast concluded, being unwilling to match the hill giants in their over-indulgence.</p>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>Not considered one of the central duties of the steading, priests operated simultaneously outside and inside of the social strata. They strove to ensure that the steading's people remained faithful to Annam All-Father and the rest of the Giant pantheon , but particularly revered their race's patron deity Grolantor .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This steading was founded in approximately 1166 DR , after hill giants were chased out Hartsvale's gentler hills by the man known as Hartkiller . In the years that followed the nobility of Hartsvale would make many attempts to drive them further away from the valley, wanting greater security for their caravans that traveled through the northern fringes, but their efforts were to no avail.</p>
<p>Around 1366 DR , the grand ruler of all hill giant tribes in the Ice Spires, Chief Noote , developed friendly relations with the royal family of Hartsvale . As a result, that kingdom's long standing feuding with the hill giant tribes came to an end. Following this event the steading's hunters were forced to cease their practice of capturing human game. Instead limiting themselves to bears , griffons , ogres , and any other exotic prey they came across.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In the mid to late 14 th century DR, over sixty hill giants inhabited this steading, three of which were priests, along with a dozen fomorian slaves and a menagerie of animals. The livestock of the steading was primarily goats and krotters , though they also had cows and the facilities necessary for caging more exotic creatures, including demihumans .</p>
