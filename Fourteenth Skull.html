<p>The Fourteenth Skull was the legendary "extra" skull in Skullport .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Although he was similar in nature to the Skulls of Skullport , he operated independently unlike the Skulls who seemed to behave collectively. The Fourteenth Skull was rarely seen and when a person saw him it was usually discounted as a drunk's hallucinations .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>His true purpose in Skullport was to strengthen the mythal around Skullport known as the Mantle . He was aided by thirteen mages that he hand selected, known as the Fray .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Fourteenth Skull's background was similar to that of the other skulls. At one time he was a drow known as the Rag Mage who moved to the Netherese enclave that became Skullport and was apparently caught in the magical backlash during Karsus's Folly .</p>
