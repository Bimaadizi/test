<p>The Savage Frontier was the region of northwest Faerûn north of the Delimbiyr River , excluding the Sword Coast North , the High Forest and the former nation of Luruar , also known as the Silver Marches . In contrast to the civilized cities found to the south and west, the Savage Frontier comprised rural farmsteads and rough settlements of miners and loggers.</p>
<p>It was a temperate land, with rugged landscape that was rich with natural resources.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Generally speaking the Savage Frontier comprised three greater regions: the expansive Delimbiyr Vale that encompassed its namesake river along the eastern and southern borders of the High Forest; the Fallen Lands , which rebuffed the Anauroch desert; and the lowlands of the Dessarin Valley , that bordered the western trees of the High Forest.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Long before the Savage Frontier was home to barbarian tribes and farmsteaders, it was home to the great elven kingdom of Eaerlann . That realm was located in the region that was later known as the Delimbiyr Valley.</p>
<p>In the Year of Watchful Eyes, 705 DR , the mages of the Covenant orchestrated the unity of the region's Uthgardt barbarians. The unified tribes banded together and fought against the frontier's goblinoid masses.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<h3>Humanoids</h3>
<p>The Savage Frontier was a racially diverse region. However, small towns and villages dominated by humans tend to have few if any non-humans. Most dwarves, elves, and halflings preferred to live in their own settlements, far from human-claimed lands.</p>
