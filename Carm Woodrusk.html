<p>Carm Woodrusk was a druid of Thorngap during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Carm had pale skin and short, backswept black hair. She wore a simple white and gray dress and tall boots.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the time of the Shadovar invasion of Wheloon , Carm was caught in Thorn Hollow by the druids and creatures loyal to the mad druid Halsaime , including Drien , Flinbeck , Garick , Larres , and Thomren . She was not subverted by the strange power from Halsaime's strange staff, and so his forces grievously wounded her and left her for dead. She survived long enough for adventurers from Eveningstar to find her and receive her cryptic advice about Halsaime in the Druid's Deep before she perished.</p>
