<p>Suzail 's Promenade was a long, splendorous, semi-circular street that arched the Royal Court district. It was the most important street in the city, and one of the best shopping strolls on Toril . For a brief war-torn period of time in Cormyr's history, it was called The March .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Promenade was a broad street, luring the city visitors with its beauty and architecture. The street linked the two main gates of Suzail's 80-foot-high curtain walls, from Horngate to the west to Eastgate . The Promenade arched separating the Court precinct from the rest of Suzail.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Suzail is famous for its day-long fairs and festivals. The Festival of the Sword was one of the fairs unique to Suzail, was held at the Royal Court district, spilling onto the Promenade. The mounted parade showing off the city's best arms and armor took place there followed by the race to the gates in the ornate fence of the Royal Court where the participants were toasted with expensive wines, sherries, and other exotic alcohol.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The promenade was famous for the beautiful continual faerie fire that went up nightly lighting it with a soft amber glow. The arcane illumination provided the street with visibility during the night, and the regular Purple Dragon patrols kept it safe. An additional benefit of the faerie fire - it kept Suzail less smoky than most other large cities, keeping the number of torches and lamps lower.</p>
<p>Due to the Promenade's location and size, the road was used by the city's garrison and defense forces. All citizens were retained to leave the Promenade immediately after a particular four-note horn call was blared. The city held drills about thrice a year to train the citizens in case of an attack.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Almost all the oldest and richest noble families of Suzail resided to the north of the Promenade.</p>
