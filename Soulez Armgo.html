<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Soulez was the mother of Mez'Barris Armgo .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Soulez had transformed House Barrison into one of the most promising houses in Menzoberranzan , despite being ranked forty-seventh or forty-third. Her strategy was to keep a low profile while gathering all the resources possible, including the best male warriors and wizards. She sought to only move up to the Ruling Council and not risk open war with a show of power.</p>
<p>In 1118 DR , she conspired with Dab'nay Tr'arach of Bregan D'aerthe to kill Zaknafein Do'Urden , having identified House Do'Urden as one of the obstacles to her ascension, especially since she was fearful of Zaknafein killing her weapon master Uthegentel . For this purpose, Soulez manipulated the resentful Arathis Hune . Matron Soulez offered to Dab'nay a place in her House in exchange for the death of Zaknafein.</p>
<p>The next year, Arathis and Zaknafein were both called to an isolated spot and were attacked by a Barrison Del'Armgo war party led by Uthegentel Del'Armgo. The pair partnered up in the fight, and managed to kill most of the Armgo warriors, except for Uthegentel. Suddenly Arathis supported Dab'nay by attacking Zaknafein. But Zak expected the betrayal and managed to kill the assassin Arathis himself, sparing Dab'nay. Despite everything, Mother Soulez was satisfied in the end, and rewarded Dab'nay by admitting her into House Armgo.</p>
