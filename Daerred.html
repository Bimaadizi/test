When Daerred was granted permission to open his guild in the Neverwintran -controlled fortress of the Crossroad Keep, his traveling companions, Candril , Maxil , and Juen joined as the guild's trainers. Together, they dreamed of opening the greatest adventuring school on the Sword Coast , passing along all things they learned from the Knight-Captain to the next generation of heroes. Daerred called his guild "the Adventurer's Guild. Crossroad Keep branch," however, as of circa the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , it was the only branch.
