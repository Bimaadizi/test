<p>Waymoot ( pronounced : /ˈ w eɪ m uː t / WAY-moot ) was a large traders' town and the biggest settlement in the King's Forest in Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Waymoot was built on a five-mile man-made clearing in the King's Forest. The town was a mish-mash collection of buildings that sprung up around a wide stone-walled keep at the center of the clearing. The said keep – Lord Woodbrand's Keep , was a small but tall structure that included a small prison attached to the outside as well as barracks and stables.</p>
<p>Waymoot's coat of arms was an image of three simple upright triangles that symbolized pine trees depicted standing side by side.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The biggest town in King's Forest , Waymoot stood on the Way of the Dragon , where it met with Ranger's Way . The town's closest neighbors were Espar , along the Way of the Dragon to the northwest, Dhedluk – to the northeast along Ranger's Way, and the Stag Steads to the northeast. Waymoot's fresh drinking water came from the Starwater River .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The town's ruler held the title of the Lord. In the mid-14 th century DR, the beloved ruler was Lord Filfar "Trollkiller" Woodband with the Herald of Cormyr being Dhag Greybeard . Alatha Korduis was Dhag's Herald-in-training during the same time period.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Waymoot was a trade town that bred and trained horses for private and army use, as well as built and repaired wagons. Due to its location and trade nature, the town had numerous inns. The horses that were purchased at Waymoot were of all categories: light, medium, and war horses . Animal pelts from the Thunder Peaks and the Storm Horns did very good business in Waymoot in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR.</p>
<p>Commercial fishers and woodcutters in the towns of the King's Forest, including Waymoot, had to obtain a legal permit to operate.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The town housed Purple Dragon troops that patrolled the roads, passing through every four hours, led by the High Constable of the King's Garrison who also recorded changed in Cormyr's adventuring charters.</p>
<p>Lord Woodbrand's Keep was defended by ballistae and catapults placed atop its battlements.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before Waymoot, the area was the site of a keep, long gone by the time the town began. Underneath it was a labyrinthine catacomb lair where a gold dragon , in a human guise, once hid the hoard. Subsequently, the dragon was slain by a beholder that penetrated the lair from deeper underground caverns. Despite the fact that the catacombs had long collapsed by the 14 th century, it was believed that the beholder still dwelt in the old dragon's lair underneath central Waymoot.</p>
<p>Waymoot began its existence as a muddy troll -infested campground that grew in size as woodcutters created a clearing, eventually becoming a compound and, eventually, a trade center and horse farms around a fortified keep.</p>
<p>Filfar "Trollkiller" Woodband in his youth, sometime in the early-to-mid 14 th century DR successfully defended Waymoot from an attacking horde of trolls virtually singlehandedly – the deed that gave him the "Trollkiller" moniker and later allowed him to be granted the title of the town's Lord.</p>
<p>Historically, Waymood was known for its rough edge and crime with a notorious thieves' guild along with other sinister organizations operating in Waymoot. However, by the mid-14 th century DR, with the death of dark deity Bhaal , the town's reputation was just that, a reputation of old, contrasted by the town's relative peace and calm.</p>
<p>In Flamerule of the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , The Firemaster , an infamous and mysterious wizard assembled mercenaries from Suzail and Westgate to try and plunder magic-filled ancient tombs north of Waymoot.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Waymoot, along with Espar , Eveningstar , and Tyrluk , was plagued by rogue dragons .</p>
