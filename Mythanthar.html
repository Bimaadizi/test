<p>Mythanthar was an elf archmage of Cormanthyr .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>His focus was so extreme, the Srinshee used to joke about it.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was slight, aged, and dressed in simple robes.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Mythanthor lost the ability to cast elven high magic to an accident.</p>
<p>He had developed the glasshields spell, as a powered down from his stronger glassshields version. He was also one of the Srinshee's three apprentices who learned the greater version of Srinshee's spell shift .</p>
<p>Amongst other spells, he knew one that enveloped targets in a golden sphere, cutting them in half. One of his abilities allowed him to block rays of fire with a gesture, and he knew a spell to redirect numerous spells at once towards a different target. One of his spells could paralyze its targets. He possessed a mantle .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He was once a student of the Srinshee. Around −2750 DR , 3000 years prior to 241 DR , he had been developing " spell fields " from mantles, for use by their war captains.</p>
<p>Mythanthor spent his last centuries researching the possibility of creating a spell linking Elven high magic with common wizardly magic after an accident that stripped him of the ability to cast elven high magic. When in 241 DR , the Coronal announced he was working on a mythal that would allow the Opening to proceed on their terms, Mythanthor became immediately the target of several assassination attempts, including one by Haemir Waelvor and several Starym which resulted in the destruction of Starfall Turret , where he was working.</p>
<p>On 261 DR , he thwarted an assassination attempt from Llombaerth Starym , in which the Lord Speaker of the Starym deceived his apprentice, Elminster Aumar , into casting lifequench on Nacacia , his other apprentice, to augment an antimagic field on Mythanthar's present hideout. Unknown to Llombaerth, Mythanthor not only prevailed over the field with a spell shear , but had also prevented the lifequench spell with a seeming , and used this to reveal Llombaerth's plan to frame Elminster; He fought against the Starym in the coup that followed.</p>
<p>Mythanthor infused his own life-force in the spell laying the mythal that took place immediately after the coup; in truth, he became himself the mythal .</p>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>Though he recorded the spells to create the mythal in Mythanthar's Folio , the book went missing from the Vault of Ages not long after, while his notes went missing from his tower.</p>
<p>Another feat of magic accomplished by Mythanthar was a network of magic gateways placed around the city of Myth Drannor and its underground structures. These portals were still operational as late as the late 14 th century DR , despite being sealed and protected. Some of them were unlocked in 1369 DR by the Veiled Ones .</p>
<p>A monument dedicated to Mythanthar was erected in front of the Speculum in Myth Drannor. The statue remained undamaged into the late 14 th century DR.</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>Mythanthor's Orb may or may not be related to him, but it was almost certainly named after him.</p>
