<p>Hellfire wyrms were a species of planar dragon , draconic agents of Baator that lived among the mortal peoples of the Material plane .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hellfire wyrms were draconic in form, with bone spikes jutting from their heads and intense yellow eyes. Their scales continually shifted color, creating the appearance of flowing lava. Smoke constantly rose from their scale and they always smelled like brimstone.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Hellfire wyrms were evil and subtle manipulators and corruptors; unfortunately, they were also very persuasive.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Hellfire wyrms were dragons, but also had some diabolic traits. They were immune to fire as well as magic that caused sleep or paralysis; and the heat that radiated off of their bodies was enough to burn anyone within 5 ft (1.5 m) of them. Additionally, hellfire wyrms could change shape at will in the form of a devil or tiefling . And, most peculiarly like devils, a hellfire wyrm could summon a single barbazu , cornugon , or gelugon once per day.</p>
<p>Like other dragons, hellfire wyrms could incite fear when they flew overhead, charged, or attacked, affecting all creatures within 240 ft (73 m) of them. They also had a number of spell-like abilities, being able to use blasphemy , charm person , demand , desecrate , dictum , fire storm , greater dispelling , hold person , improved invisibility , misdirection , pyrotechnics , sending , suggestion , teleport without error , true seeing , unholy aura , unhallow , and wall of fire all at will.</p>
<p>And finally, hellfire wyrms had a breath weapon in the form of 50‑foot (15‑meter) cone of infernal fire .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Hellfire wyrms were completely fearless but preferred to attack from the air, relying on their breath weapon and spell-like abilities to fell enemies.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Hellfire wyrms served, in some fashion, the devils of the Nine Hells by corrupting and manipulating events among the mortal peoples. They would set a secret lair in a region, then use their wealth, knowledge, and skill at persuasion to worm their way into regional politics. Their area of influence typically extended through several kingdoms, and the dragon would have a different tiefling identity for each realm it was involved in. Naturally, they went to great lengths to keep their true, draconic nature and form secret. Hellfire wyrms would then steer rulers into fighting unjust wars, supporting unholy causes, or even committing despotic acts against the ruler's own people.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before 1357 DR , one of the copious Manshoon clones perished trying to tame a hellfire wyrm.</p>
