<p>Duromil the Fearless ( pronounced : /ˈ d ʌr ˈ oʊ m ɪ l / Durr-OH-mil ) was a rogue in Waterdeep in 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Duromil was very good at hiding his true nature as thief and no one in the city suspected him, a sign of his great ability.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Duromil posed as an average fighter who frequented the inns and taverns of the Castle Ward of Waterdeep but in truth he was a very capable thief who waited for the right occasion to steal precious items. Occasionally, he really worked for Blazidon One-Eye if times were lean. Sometimes, Duromil accompanied adventuring parties as a fighter-for-hire and secretly stole from them. However, he was always very cautious, declining to act if there was even the slightest chance of failure.</p>
