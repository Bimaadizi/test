<p>Prince Lamruil Moonflower was the youngest son of the late King Zaor Moonflower and Queen Amlaruil Moonflower of Evermeet in the 14 th century DR. He was the thirteenth and last among his royal siblings. He was later the bearer of the King's Blade , the most powerful elven moonblade and heir apparent to the throne of Evermeet. Since 1371 DR , he was the husband of Maura , the eldest daughter of Laeral Silverhand . In the same year, the couple founded the hidden elven city Auseriel .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was strikingly handsome, even for an elf , with black hair and piercing blue eyes. He had the eyes of a Moonflower—deep, bright blue flecked with golden lights—and possessed his father's great height and muscular form, topping 6 feet (1.8 meters). Under Kymil's imprisonment during the ocean voyage in 1371 DR , he became thinner and less hale than before, but still outmassed most elves Kymil memorized.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was the sunny, charming, spoiled baby of the family. By the time he was no more than thirty or forty, he had taken up adventuring and wenching as avocations. Lamruil was much given to mischief, but well restrained by his devotion and admiration for his sister Amnestria Moonflower . He had scant interest in the art of magic. He was quite outgoing and somewhat frivolous and had a fondness for humans .</p>
<p>He shared his mother's passion for the ancient treasures of elvenkind, and he knew the old legends as well as any seer or loremaster .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lamruil spent a good deal of his early life adventuring in Faerûn , going as far east as Semphar and Raurin , and gaining considerable experience and understanding of the lands of humans .</p>
<p>Lamruil was the only other person of the House Moonflower to know of Amnestria's four-month pregnancy, of her secret son with Elaith Craulnober .</p>
<p>His father, King Zaor, was assassinated on Ches 2 , the Year of Chains, 1321 DR , by an agent of a certain sun elf . Later the same year, Amnestria was exiled from Evermeet by the elven nobles for bearing an unborn half-elf child and Lamruil's niece, Arilyn Moonblade . Lamruil did not know she went to live in Evereska and worked under a pseudonym at the College of Magic and Arms .</p>
<p>He traveled with Kymil Nimesin in looking for the lost Moonflower children. Under his former swordmaster Kymil, he studied the arts of swordcraft, though he often showed more interest in drinking and wenching. By then, it had been over 25 years since Amnestria's death and more than 40 years since King Zaor's death.</p>
<p>In the Year of Moonfall, 1344 DR , Lamruil's homeland had a large influx of elves due to the Retreat .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR , Lamruil's niece Arilyn Moonblade temporarily named him the heir of her moonblade if she fell, in front of her childhood friend Ganemede of the lythari . If nothing unexpected happened, Ganemede then would send the moonblade back to him through a portal on Evermeet.</p>
<p>By 1367 DR , the 95-year-old Lamruil had become a capable fighter and adventurer, but still seen as an inexperienced youth in elven eyes. While disguised, he attended Kymil's sentencing by the Harper Tribunal, which led him to recognize Arilyn as Amnestria's unknown daughter and become friends with Danilo Thann .</p>
<p>Lamruil was mentioned in a Ches 3 , 1368 DR , letter from Laeral to Danilo, Arilyn's husband. On Flamerule 20 , he sent a letter to his nephew-friend Danilo to thank him for providing the ballad he planned to sing to Maura as a midsummer gift. In his letter, Lamruil also detailed his midsummer lovemaking to Elora and at the end, wished to give regards to Arilyn and the "little one" nephew.</p>
<p>On Mirtul 13 of the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , he gave a letter from Danilo to his mother the Queen concerning Kymil's treachery and ambition. Afterwards, he swore to Maura in Ruith he would not take anyone as his queen while she lived. He departed the island to capture Kymil as his responsibility until his enslaved return in 1371 DR .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Lamruil was automatically the heir apparent when Ilyrana sacrificed herself to thwart Ityak-Ortheel during Nimesin's War . Before Eleint 30 , Lamruil, despite his early habits, successfully drew the King's Sword . Later the year, the married man then undertook the task of planting the great elven artifact known as the Tree of Souls given to him by Queen Amlaruil on the mainland. Once planted, it would establish a new elven realm.</p>
<p>Prince Lamruil, along with his teenage human bride consort Maura and a widely varied group of elven adventurers, set out to find a foothold in the most remote, inaccessible, and forbidding lands of northernmost Faerûn. In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , they traveled to the northern reaches of Faerûn and established a hidden city called Auseriel .</p>
<p>On Mirtul 2 , the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , when Auseriel was besieged by a family of white dragons , Lamruil was urged by his wife Maura to bring the Tree of Souls back to Evermeet. His wife chose to stay behind and lead her rearguard to hold off the invaders. Lamruil returned on Mirtul 4 with a band of elf knights, but found the city abandoned amid a dozen white dragon corpses, and no sign of his wife or her elf defenders. He vowed to rebuild the city and then began a search for his princess.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Blazing Hand, 1380 DR , the high mage Araevin Teshurr visited the rebuilt Auseriel and there he met and befriended Prince Lamruil. They both left Auseriel, which was left to Lamruil's seneschal, to look for the lost Princess Maura, being guided by a mysterious prophecy revealed to them by Araevin's magic.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Lamuril customarily carried the sword Halakashara , an ancient elven blade he obtained while adventuring in Myth Drannor . He was proficient in the longbow , dagger , footman's flail , horse lance , and spear and specialized in the broadsword . He was also proficient in animal handling, blacksmithing, armorer, bow making with arrow fletching, as well as gambling, and weaponsmithing. He also wore Zaor's pendant around his neck.</p>
