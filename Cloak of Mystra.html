<p>Cloaks of Mystra , more colloquially known as Mystra's Blessing , were enchanted cloaks created by the Church of Mystra to offer mages and sorcerers of the land additional protection against harm.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Each cloak of Mystra was blessed by the Mother of All Magic to grant the wearer resistance to damage done by physical means. The cloaks protected their wearers as if bearing a simple +1 enchantment, but, in addition to that protection, Mystra's blessing allowed the cloaks to absorb some of the damage done. Due to the nature of the item, such cloak could only be worn by a wizard or a sorcerer.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Cloaks of Mystra were first created sometime before the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR . In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , one such cloak belong to the proprietor of Icewind Enchantments in Targos , Silvenius Crim , a member of the Arcane Brotherhood , sent to establish operations in Icewind Dale .</p>
