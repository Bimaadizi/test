<p>The Resting Place of the Whip was the temple of Loviatar in Melvaunt in the 1370s DR .</p>
<p>The temple had seventeen priests , led by High Whipmistress Suzildara Sharranen . The temple was not particularly popular as worship of Loviatar had decreased significantly by 1373 DR . The church remained thanks in no small part to the alliance they formed with a local cult dedicated to Iyachtu Xvim .</p>
