<p>The Night Brigade was a militant gang of Sharran Wheloon Prisoners led by the devoted priestess of Shar Storna Harnwood in the late 15 th century DR . They enjoyed a period of growing power and influence inside the prison until they were finally destroyed by the forces of the rival Riverside Rats gang.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The gang's various interests were overseen by different officers within the organization. They acted semi-independently, and each received a share of the gang's profits that they used for their own desires and goals.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Night Brigade's ultimate home was the Temple of Shar they built atop the ruins of the Riverside Rats hideouts. The impressive temple was well-appointed and well-defended, and served as a true stronghold of their power in the city.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The gang was founded by the devotee of Shar, Storna Harnwood, and it was by her strong will that the gang was able to slowly win wealth, power, and influence over the prison. Their finest moment was the near-destruction of the Riverside Rats gang, which let them build their Temple of Shar on the ruins of their old rats nest. Unfortunately for them, this led to the Rats seeking allies outside of the prison, who proceeded to lead a retributive strike on the Night Brigade with the assistance of talismans that allowed shapeshifting into rats . First Battlemaster Agarta was slain in her own arena, then Master Thief Karissa was cornered in her own hideout, and Grand Arcanist Darstil was killed while obsessing over his experiments. Finally, with the blessings of Sel√ªne helping to throw back Shar's darkness, they attacked the Temple of Shar and slew Storna Harnwood, utterly breaking the gang and ending its reign over the city.</p>
