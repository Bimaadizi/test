<p>The Green Dragon Mask was one of the five dragon masks that carried the blessings of Tiamat in the efforts of the reformed Cult of the Dragon to summon her to Toril .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Green Dragon Mask was colored various hues of green, with a line of frills at its top and spikes jutting down the jawline.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The wearer of the Green Dragon Mask gained several powers, such as reduced harm from poisons , overall greater protection from physical attacks and the ability to breathe unhindered while underwater. They were also granted darkvision and blindsight , as well as the understanding of the Draconic language .</p>
<p>The main feature of the Green Dragon Mask , or any others of its kind, was to transform its wearer into a wyrmspeaker . These individuals could think in a manner similar to dragons , and gain subtle influence over their behaviors.</p>
<p>When two or more of the masks were brought together, they reformed as the Mask of the Dragon Queen , which combined their properties and bestowed them onto the wearer. This valuable artifact was the essential piece needed to complete the ritual to free Tiamat from the Nine Hells .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>For a time in the 1480s DR , the mask remained in the possession of Neronvain , the elven wyrmspeaker of the Misty Forest . However it was eventually transported to the Well of Dragons for safekeeping by Severin Silrajin , and assembled into the Mask of the Dragon Queen ahead of Severin's ritual to summon Tiamat.</p>
