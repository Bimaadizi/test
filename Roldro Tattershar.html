<p>Roldro Tattershar was a bard and Harper operating in Suzail and Marsember in Cormyr during the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Roldro wore gray, dusty, and faded leathers during undercover stints, and he had a "villainous" fake mustache to go with it. Normally, he was dressed in flamboyantly florid tones.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He had been a guest of Lady Joysil Ambrur . They were close enough that he called her by a different name, "Ammaratha", and knew enough to give her room when he believed she'd transform into a dragon.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Roldro Tattershar was drinking at the Green Wyvern in Suzail when two men teleported in front of him. Those men, the Red Wizard Harnrim Starangh and War Wizard Huldyl Rauthur , discussed briefly the plans of Vangerdahast , the then-retired Royal Mage of Cormyr, to bind dragons to service. They teleported away shortly after; as they planned, Roldro overheard them and immediately used a portal hidden in the tavern to head over to Marsember and share this information with Lady Joysil Ambrur, with the nefarious intent of "stirring the cauldron".</p>
<p>Once at the residence of the lady, he was stopped, first by the guard Melarvyn , and then by the steward, Elward . Both refused him entry; removing his mustache, he threatened Elward to tell the watch about a certain Elward of Westgate . The man relented; when Roldro finally was face-to-face with Lady Joysil, she instructed Elward to move as far back as the southern pond. Roldro knew her by the name of Ammaratha; he gave her space, taking several steps back, as he revealed to her that he'd overheard two War Wizards of Cormyr revealing that Vangerdahast was binding dragons. This turned out to be the right move, as she immediately turned into her natural form as a song dragon and flew straight through the ceiling.</p>
<p>He took a chest of jewels as a down-payment, and departed through a secret passage, anticipating the steward would be furious.</p>
