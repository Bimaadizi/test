<p>Sultan Street was a busy market road in Khaerbaal , a port city of Halruaa .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sultan Street stood within walking distance from the docks of Khaerbaal. Like many other places in the city, massive bilboa trees loomed over the street's many shops, stalls, and workshops. Long colorful silk banners were used as shop signs that made the street a vibrant sight to behold. Narrow alleyways between closely nestled buildings were almost invisible to casual observers. Many of the alleyway entrances and buildings were covered in thick, fragrant flowering vines. Some were thick and sturdy enough to be climbed.</p>
<p>Several blocks down the street stood a large island of thick greeneryâ€”a public garden built around another sprawling bilboa tree.</p>
