<p>Respen Moongleam was a human cleric of Selûne who was an acolyte at the House of the Moon temple in Waterdeep and a navigator in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Respen was known to be scholarly and quick to laugh, and he loved everything to do with the sea.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Respen was serving as a ship's navigator on the Harebrained Harpy , a Waterdhavian raker operating in the Sea of Swords to the north. In the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , it was attacked by pirates flying the colors of Luskan , led by the enigmatic Black Admiral . The Harpy was sunk with all hands on board, but Respen was rescued from the freezing waters to face a far worse fate. Captain Kulleras—in fact, the greater doppelganger Khnarek —killed him, ate his brain, and absorbed his personality and memories.</p>
<p>Khnarek then adopted Respen's form, had himself placed back in the sea on well-traveled shipping lanes, and was rescued by a passing caravel and taken to Waterdeep. His guise and cover story complete, Khnarek, as Respen and other personas, then infiltrated the House of the Moon and the rest of Waterdeep. For an alibi, he had "Respen" work often with the poor of the Dock Ward . He was in place by 1368 DR and through 1370 DR .</p>
