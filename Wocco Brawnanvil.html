<p>Wocco Brawnanvil was the chief blacksmith of Mithral Hall .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was the cousin of Banak Brawnanvil , a famous dwarven general.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the War of the Silver Marches , Banak and his forces were desperately trying to fight off the numerous orcs and giants . However, his situation became dire, and he was almost forced to retreat. However, the gnome tinkerer, Nanfoodle , had a plan to cause a huge explosion and kill off the largest invaders. The gnome told Ivan Bouldershoulder of his plan, and Ivan set off to inform Wocco.</p>
<p>Ivan navigated his way through the deep forges and relayed the orders to Wocco. Though Wocco initially thought the plan was insane, he heeded his orders and produced hundreds of long metal tubes. After Wocco and his workers transferred the rods to the seemingly-crazy gnome, Nanfoodle initiated his plan. The result was a gargantuan explosion, killing off a great number of the enemy forces. This explosion, Nanfoodle's dragon , became the greatest recorded fireball in history, even eclipsing those of Elminster himself.</p>
