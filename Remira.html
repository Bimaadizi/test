<p>Remira was an archer that roamed the Western Heartlands circa the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Remira often wore a leather jerkin when She fought with a bow with a green grip.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point Remira applied with Ansur's Finest adventurers' guild of Baldur's Gate . Even though Sevrin Bask , recruitment officer, was impressed with the archer's field expertise, he decided against allowing her to join, citing the excessive use of words such as "pay" and "bounty" that were at odds with the culture of Ansur's Finest.</p>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR Remira and her fellow adventurers Aradin and Barth were chased by Za'krug 's goblinoids towards the gate of the Emerald Grove . They were not allowed access until the leader of the local tieflings , Zevlor , granted permission. By that time however, the goblins were already upon the front gates of the grove.</p>
