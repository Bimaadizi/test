<p>Golmuth , the Fifth City of the Sword , was one of the core cities in ancient Jhaamdath .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Golmuth was a few days west of the First City, Naarkolyth , just north of Gharrent and south of the Orsraun Mountains . After its destruction, it lay in the Selmal Basin beneath the waters of the Vilhon Reach .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Golmuth was founded in −5425 DR as the fifth of Jhaamdath's cities, preceded the same year by nearby Gharrent.</p>
<p>In the Year of Overflowing Casks, −276 DR , Jhaamdath began aggressively deforesting the Chondalwood and slaying the elves of Nikerymath . The elven response in the Year of Furious Waves, −255 DR was a High Magic ritual that caused a great wave from the Inner Sea to wash over the Cities of the Sword and destroy the aggressors. Golmuth remained a sunken ruin hidden beneath the water, with its many lost psionic artifacts slowly affecting the nearby environment.</p>
<p>The sunken ruins of Jhaamdath were suddenly revealed by the lower sea levels that followed the Spellplague in 1385 DR , becoming the Vilhon Wilds . They were then returned to obscurity by the Great Rain and Second Sundering in 1486 DR .</p>
