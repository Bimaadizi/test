<p>Princess Ebonmire was a sentient black pudding follower of the Pudding King in Blingdenstone in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At an unknown time, the black pudding devoured two spellbooks written by svirfneblin archmage Lesla Carrowil .</p>
<p>The Pudding King, an insane deep gnome fascinated by oozes , subjugated the black pudding, which he called Princess Ebonmire, and a gray ooze he called Prince Livid . Princess Ebonmire and Prince Livid always remained close to the Pudding King.</p>
<p>Circa 1486 DR , after a great battle between the Pudding King's ooze army and all the factions of Blingdenstone gathered together, Princess Ebonmire was killed just before its master by a party of adventurers hired by some deep gnome factions after escaping from drow slavers of Velkynvelve .</p>
