<p>Malyk was a lord of Daggerdale in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He was allegedly from a far-distant branch of the House of Morn , the historic rulers of Daggerdale . His loyalty to the Black Network of the Zhentarim prompted them to instill rebellion, eliminate the House of Morn and install Malyk as the Lord of Daggerdale. The surviving heir to the house was the adventurer Randal Morn who fled into the hills to raise a resistance force.</p>
<p>Malyk ruled as a puppet leader for the Zhentarim until the Year of the Arch, 1353 DR when he was killed in an attack lead by Randal Morn and his followers.</p>
