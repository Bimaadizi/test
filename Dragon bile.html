<p>Dragon bile was just that, bile extracted from a dragon 's gallbladder and turned into a potent contact poison .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Apart from bones and scales, dragon's bile was perhaps the most sought-after part of a slain wyrm. A competent poison maker could turn the draconic substance into a poison of varied strengths. The strongest type of dragon bile was collected from ancient dragons and wielded only by the most deadly of assassins. The bile was green in color.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Dragon bile was most often used to coat blades . When the poison was introduced onto a target's skin or in their bloodstream, the substance started sapping their strength. Despite dragon bile rarely causing death, its weakening effect was devastatingly dangerous. A single vial of the substance usually held enough poison for five applications.</p>
<p>Dragon bile was commonly used as poison in traps or as coating for locks or other object prone to be touched by thieves and rogues.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , dragon bile was sold by mind flayers of the illithid black market hidden in the mountains west of Samargol in the jungles of Samarach .</p>
