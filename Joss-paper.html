<p>Joss-paper was an uncommon type of paper made and used in Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Joss-paper was made from bamboo pulp, and embedded with pieces of gold leaf. A typical piece of joss-paper was roughly 4 square inches (26 square centimeters) in size. Joss-paper was very difficult to make and only the best paper-makers were capable of producing joss-paper.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>If ambushed by a kaluk , a human could bribe the kaluk with a piece of high-quality joss-paper. Kaluks desired joss-paper so much that if offered, they lost the desire to attack the human. Instead they would add the piece of joss-paper to their cape and then find a body of water or another reflective surface in which to admire their cape.</p>
