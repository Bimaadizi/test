<p>Gwylloch Cymrych was High King of the Moonshae Isles in the late 3 rd century DR . He was famed as the homicidal builder of the gruesome Castle of Skulls .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was a member of the Cymrych Dynasty and the grandson of the dynasty’s legendary namesake, Cymrych Hugh . He was the eldest son of his predecessor, High King Carrig I . His successor was his younger brother, Gorham Cymrych .</p>
<p>Gwylloch had at least two sons: Ketheryll , the elder son, and Markus , his second son. Markus would go on to become High King after Gorham.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gwylloch assumed the throne of the High King in the Year of the Warped Narthex, 287 DR , after his father died in battle against the Northmen . He continued fighting the Northmen, and was an avid practitioner of a Ffolk tradition of collecting the severed heads of his enemies. By the Year of the Waking Dreams, 289 DR , his collection of enemy skulls had become so vast that he used them to construct a palace for himself: the Castle of Skulls . He was so impressed with this construction that he relocated his retainers and courtesans to this castle.</p>
<p>Over the next several years, he launched numerous expeditions against the Northmen, collecting more skulls as well as captives to be killed in his " Circus Bizarre " arena. He also warred with any lords of the Ffolk who resisted his authority, and in the Year of the Wrathful Revenant, 295 DR , King Durnhal and Queen Morgan of Corwell were accused of treason against him, and were put to death by his son, Prince Ketheryll.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Gwylloch and Ketheryll went mad, and on the night of the Summer Solstice in the tenth year of Gwylloch's reign , they and their retainers all perished in a rabid, suicidal orgy of combat within the Castle of Skulls. While it was believed that the stench of death within the macabre castle had driven them to this madness , some suspected that the wizard Flamsterd may have played a role in their deaths and the downfall of the Castle of Skulls, perhaps with the aid of the Earthmother .</p>
