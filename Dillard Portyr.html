<p>Dillard Portyr ( pronounced : /ˈ d ɪ l ɛ r d p ɔːr ˈ t ɪər / DILL-erd por-TEER ) was the leading Grand Duke of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR . He later ceded the title of Grand Duke to Ulder Ravengard following recent disturbances in the city and continued to serve as a Duke as part of the Council of Four .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Dillard disliked conflict, mostly for not being able to manage the stress. As a leader he was a weathercock, turning wherever the wind blew him.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was uncle to Liara Portyr , a high-ranking commander in the Flaming Fist .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, Dillard was the most senior of the Grand Dukes and for this reason their unofficial leader. In the Year of the Narthex Murders, 1482 DR , Dillard also survived the crisis in Baldur's Gate that culminated in the resurrection of Bhaal .</p>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Duke Portyr recalled his niece Liara from her post at Fort Beluarian in Chult , after Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard 's disappearance during the Descent of Elturel .</p>
<p>When Baldur's Gate fell into turmoil, he gave a speech to the Baldurian people in the Wide . He was killed that day when someone shot an arrow into his chest, he exploded, and devils burst from his body.</p>
<p>Somehow, Duke Portyr recovered from his apparent violent death. [ speculation ] Later in the year, the Church of Bane and Lord Enver Gortash targeted Dillard in Enver's quest for power. The cult thought Dillard to be a coward and planned to have him resign, through simple threats, passing the seat to his niece Liara Portyr, who, in turn, was to be infected with an illithid tadpole and indoctrinated into the service to the Absolute. He later attended the inauguration of Lord Enver Gortash in Wyrm's Rock fortress and appointed him, along with Ulder Ravengard , as the first Archduke of Baldur's Gate.</p>
