<h2>History</h2>
<p>Baron Lutwill claimed to have received his power from the city council of Zazesspur . In the summer of the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR , he sought to double the taxes on the villages in his lands with only seven days notice. On the night that he sent out his soldiers to collect the taxes, Star Protective Services —led by Zaranda Star —and a group of villagers from the region around Castle Lutwill stormed the castle.</p>
<p>When Zaranda reached the penthouse and began to battle Baron Lutwill, they were equally matched until Lutwill's chamberlain, Whimberton, held her with his magic. Lutwill considered whether to kill her immediately or to have his way with her. However, Zaranda's charge and apprentice, Chenowyn , arrived, and surrounded Whimberton with magical shimmering lights , which caused the wizard to fall through a window to his death. Zaranda was then free to move again. She kneed Lutwill in the groin, dodged his final swing, covered his head with a wolfskin , and then stabbed him in the face repeatedly.</p>
