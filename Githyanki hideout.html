<h2>History</h2>
<p>Once the Kalach-Cha defeated the Luskanites at the Sea Ghost, Brelaina tasked him/her to get into the hideout, since they couldn't allow assassins to roam Neverwinter. Inside, the Kalach-Cha slayed many githyanki. In one room, a construct appeared and killed some githyanki, then attacked the Kalach-Cha. Once the construct was badly damaged, it retreated back to the portal.</p>
