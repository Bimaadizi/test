<p>Jon Talvick was one of the neighbors of the ex- Harper thief named Edgin Darvis in the town of Targos in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jon and his wife Veri lived next door to Edgin and were friends of his deceased wife Zia . When Ed was left alone with a newborn, Jon's family happily babysat young Kira . Jon's nine-year-old daughter Miriam adored the newborn and happily took care of her when Edgin needed help.</p>
<p>Jon and his family babysat Kira when Edgin and his new friend Holga Kilgore embarked on their first heist: Pendro's Pawnshop in Targos. Nine years later, in the 1490s DR , Jon and Veri's youngest child, Sief , accompanied his father to the Trip and Shuffle tavern for dinner and to listen to a red-haired hin minstrel 's crooning. That was the night when a marauding band of gnolls attacked the tavern after finding their way into Targos. In the chaos and brawl, gnolls got away with the stolen loot and grabbed the four-year-old Sief, leaving Jon distraught, but with his ankle broken, he could not run and rescue his son.</p>
<p>Edgin, Holga, and their new thieving ally, Forge Fitzwilliam , set out to find the marauders and recover their stolen gold, unaware of a kidnapped child sure to become the hyenas' next meal. After a wild fight and cunning use of a nestful of hungry stirges , Sief was rescued and returned to Jon, and it awas the deed that made Edgin and his crew the local heroes.</p>
