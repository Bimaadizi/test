<p>Runepowder was a dangerous and extremely volatile gnomish substance that was believed to be a myth by many as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The recipe for runepowder was a tightly guarded secret believed to be lost or rare and almost mythical. The substance was a certain mixture of smokepowder and gnomish magics.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>It was said that a single vial of runepowder packed more wallop than a barrelful of smokepowder. Some exaggerated the substance's power claiming it was volatile enough to level the city of Baldur's Gate . In reality, a vial of rune power had more than double the explosive power of a barrel of smokepowder.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was believed that runepowder was a creation of Gaerdal Ironhand , a gnomish deity known as the Shield of the Golden Hills. By the late 15 th century DR, all records of the substance had been stricken from historic records due to the dangers associated with the substance. The only creatures who still remembered of its existence were gnomes, yet even among them, many believed runepowder to be a children's tale.</p>
<p>Shortly before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a svirfneblin of the Ironhand gnomes named Wulbren , from the city of Baldur's Gate , uncovered a runepowder formula. Its written copy was destroyed in an encounter with members of the Cult of the Absolute in 1492 DR, making Wulbren's mind the last existing record of the invaluable recipe. A deep gnome named Philomeen tried to claim an unknown amount of runepowder and escape from duergar slavery. She hoped to use the substance to aid her people.</p>
