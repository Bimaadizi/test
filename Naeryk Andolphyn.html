<p>Naeryk Andolphyn was a noble in Suzail during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>He was sharp-featured, with a forked beard that was waxed to stay that way. The wax was scented like tropical blossoms, and it was a little strong.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He owned a coach.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On the original day of the Council of the Dragon , after sending poison smoke into Castle Obarskyr to force a delay, the vampire archmage Manshoon enslaved the mind of Naeryk Andolphyn while the latter was at a tavern. On the day after, Naeryk Andolphyn had Lord Danthalus Blacksilver ride to court in his coach; the two made small talk about the things they saw from the coach, such as a noble arrived with very much an army of his own, a coach pulled by what appeared to be lions , how mad the War Wizards would be about that, and cheeses and wines from far away, such as Sembian soft sharpsnip .</p>
