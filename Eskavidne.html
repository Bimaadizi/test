<p>Eskavidne was one of the most powerful yochlol servants of Lolth in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Dwarvenkind Reborn, 1488 DR , Matron Mother Zhindia Melarn summoned Eskavidne in order to learn the will of Lolth regarding the resurrection of Zaknafein , hoping it was also possible to resurrect her daughter, Yazhin Melarn . Eskavidne however arrived together with Yiccardaria , who, thanks to strange collateral effects of the incursion of demon lords into the Underdark in 1486 DR , managed to return to Toril .</p>
<p>Later, Eskavidne helped Zhindia to devise a plot to capture or kill Drizzt and Zaknafein. With this objective, the yochlol provided some retrievers for Matron Zhindia. With these monsters, a demon army, and the support of House Hunzrin advised by Eskavidne and Yiccardaria, Zhindia started a war against the surface, still with the objective of killing Drizzt and Zaknafein.</p>
<p>After a retriever presumably killed Drizzt, the demon army was advancing through Gauntlgrym , and Margaster allies had conquered Luskan and Port Llast , Eskavidne and Yiccardaria also granted to Zhindia the command of an army of resurrected driders . Some time after, however, Eskavidne and Yiccardaria took back the retrievers and pressed Zhindia to send all of her demons to search for and kill Zaknafein.</p>
<p>Later, Eskavidne argued with Yiccardaria as they were worried they had deviate from the will of Lolth, because the retrievers were provided by Malcanthet and the drider army had been called from the Abyss by Yiccardaria alone, without Lolth's counsel.</p>
<p>Zhindia had a final battle against the army of Menzoberranzan but, during that fight, the spells of Quenthel Baenre and Yvonnel Baenre II managed to turn all the driders back into drow again in a miraculous event. When Zhindia screamed to Eskavidne and Yiccardaria, they started to laugh, telling her chaos was the will of Lolth, and went back to the Abyss.</p>
