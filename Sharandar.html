<p>Around 1479 DR , eladrin descendants of the empire of Illefarn , led by the fey knight Merrisara Winterwhite were attempting to restore the ruins of Sharandar, and by extension all of the empire of Iliyanbruen , by making incursions into Neverwinter Wood through a portal from the Feywild located within the Feywild city of New Sharandar .</p>
