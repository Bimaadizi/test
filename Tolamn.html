<p>Tolamn was a wizard from Shussel during the early 13 th century DR . Between 1204 DR and 1221 DR , he went to a Magefair attended by the Magister , Haelvar Ildagh ; there, he attempted to attack the other mages, starting a brawl that was stopped by Azuth and Mystra themselves, feebleminding him and a couple other mages, then restoring to life and health all of their victims. This was shocking to the Magister.</p>
