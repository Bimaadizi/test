<p>Whitesails Harbor was a harbor located on the shore of Luskan 's North Bank . It was one of the two harbors in the city, the other being Dragon Beach .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Whitesails was a busy port. It was well-defended, and the main part of the harbor was only usable by Luskanite ships . It was well-known as a haven for pirates, although it was considered rude for foreigners to say so.</p>
<p>Whitesails was sheltered from the waves and storms of the Trackless Sea by a breakwater extending from Harbor Arm Island , however the northernmost part of the harbor was more exposed to the elements and was known as the Open Shore . This section was the only place in the city where foreign vessels were allowed to dock.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Guard towers at the end of the breakwater and on Harbor Arm Island were garrisoned with Luskanite troops with orders to fire on any unauthorized people or vessels attempting to enter the harbor.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , the Luskan navy—which swore loyalty to the High Captains of Luskan —became based out of Whitesails Harbor after previously having operated out of Dragon Beach. At this time, Whitesails was one of the most dangerous places in Lusakn, especially for visitors to the city. This was in part because the harbor's guards were paid for every "intruder" they hit with their arrows , leading them to sometimes fire into the neighboring Mirabar District in hopes of hitting someone.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Bent Blade, 1376 DR , when Deudermont led an effort to unseat the Arcane Brotherhood 's grip on Luskan, a major turning point came when the pirates of Whitesails decided to join his attack on the Host Tower of the Arcane by helping to resupply his ships with ammunition. This was arguably the moment that helped High Captain Kurth to realize that the Brotherhood had truly lost the support of the people of Luskan, leading him to side with Deudermont.</p>
