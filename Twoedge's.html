<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Twoedge's was known in Skullport as a reliable destination for blade maintenance and repair. His services typically ranged from sharpening to restoring blades, with standard repairs costing approximately 25â€“40% of the weapon's original price. However, he was unable to mend items that have been destroyed by magical means or through the effects of rust monsters .</p>
<p>Twoedge charged sharpening fees based on weapon size: 2 sp for small weapons, 4 sp for medium weapons, and 6 sp for large weapons. He also offered a premium sharpening service utilizing a magical whetstone he'd acquired from Undermountain in his youth. Any bladed weapon, magical or otherwise, sharpened with this whetstone saw an increase in damage inflicted. This specialized service was priced at 50 gp .</p>
<p>On occasion, Twoedge sold weapons that were left behind by individuals who failed to pay or neglected to reclaim their items. These were typically priced at about 75% of their original cost. In rare instances, enchanted weapons may be available among these unclaimed items; the price for such magical armaments was negotiated directly with Twoedge.</p>
