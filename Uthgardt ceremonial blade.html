<p>Uthgardt ceremonial blades were a variety of enchanted two-bladed swords created on the Sword Coast North in the late 14 th century DR , with the most powerful variety crafted by the retired adventurer and a hero of Neverwinter , Daelan Red Tiger .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>There existed three variants of Uthgardt ceremonial blades , each possessing +1 , +2 , or +8 enchantments that made the sword 's edges deadlier and guided the wielder's hand towards the target. All three versions possessed supernaturally keen blades and dealt cold damage to the targets. The stronger +2 and +8 varieties also steeled the wielder's discipline.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>An Uthgardt ceremonial blade could be created from a simple enchanted two-bladed sword and ironwood .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Despite being more common among the Uthgardt barbarians of the North , the more common versions of Uthgardt ceremonial blades with a simpler +1 enchantment were forged by Master Blacksmith Marrok of the Shining Knight Arms and Armor shop in Neverwinter to help the heroes who sought the cure for the dreaded Wailing Death in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Later the same year, more powerful versions were created by Master Blacksmith Barun of Beorunna's Well to help the forces of Neverwinter stand against Lady Aribeth the Betrayer , who led a marching army of Luskan in the deadly but short-lived Neverwinter-Luskan war.</p>
<p>However, the most notable of these weapons were created by a half-orcish hero and a companion of the Hero of Neverwinter , Daelan Red Tiger, after he returned to his tribe following the Luskan - Neverwinter war of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Daelan sought to forge a blade that could match his skill and power. He worked tirelessly until he collapsed by the forge exhausted. When the half-orc woke up, instead of one sword, he found ten. Daelan praised his deity and handed the swords out to the warrior members of his tribe. With time, some warriors who wielded Daelan's blades left the tribe or fell in battle. Only several of these weapons made it back to the Uthgardt.</p>
