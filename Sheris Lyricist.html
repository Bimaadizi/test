<p>Sheris Lyricist was a noblewoman and the leader of the adventuring company - the Lady's Lament from Waterdeep , active circa 1310 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sheris was a charismatic, pampered, and spoiled young lady from the City of Splendors. Her main passion was music, and she worked hard to be a skilled musician.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Several years before the Year of Storms, 1310 DR , Sheris's pampered life of luxury came to an end when she found out about a marriage arranged by her father. Unwilling to comply with her noble family's wishes, Sheris fled home and took on the only job she could - becoming a bard . Eventually, Sheris organized an adventuring company she named the Lady's Lament. Her adventuring troupe grew as several individuals joined: a half-orcish couple Geldin and Khatja , a cleric of Ilmater named Laeris who offered his wise advice to compliment Sheris's charisma, a drow sorceress Vraedna who denounced Lolth , and a hin rogue Kylie who used his shiny personality to put a smile on the faces of his teammates.</p>
<p>In 1310 DR, the Lady's Lament, along with many other mercenaries, traveled from Luskan to the besieged city of Targos in the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale .</p>
