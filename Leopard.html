<p>Leopards were a species of large felines .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Leopards had lithe, slender bodies with short legs. They had rosette-shaped spots, as did jaguars .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Leopards attacked prey by leaping on them from above. They had very sharp claws that caused significant damage.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Their powerful hindquarters allowed a leopard to jump up to 25 ft (7.6 m). They were adept climbers and swimmers.</p>
<h2>Habitat</h2>
<p>Leopards dwelt in tropical jungles as well as forests. They could also be found living in deserts, mountains and plains. Leopards spent a good portion of their day in the treetops. They slept there and when they caught prey, they preferred to drag the prey up into the treetops to be eaten. Leopards could be found living in the Forest of Amtar , the Kun-Yen Shan mountains, the Methwood , and the jungles of Chult .</p>
<p>In east Zakhara , they could be found in the Grey Jungle . And in the Crowded Sea south of Zakhara , leopards could be found on the Djinni's Claws island chain.</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>Leopards were solitary creatures. They were obligate carnivores and hunted large animals such as antelopes . Leopards hunted both during the day and at night, but if they lived in an area with many humanoids , they usually only hunted at night. After mating, a female leopard gave birth to a litter of up to three cubs, who remained by their mothers side for two years.</p>
