<h2>History</h2>
<p>Pierson lived in this house. When duergar and bladelings attacked the village in 1374 DR , Pierson locked himself in the house, afraid someone would steal his supplies. The Kalach-Cha was able to intimidate him, lie to him, pick the lock, or bash the door to get in. In any case, the Kalach-Cha could've ordered him to get into the fight, since he was a member of the militia. After Pierson went to the field, the Kalach-Cha could've looted his house or leave the supplies.</p>
