<p>Witherite was a yellow to white semi-precious gemstone.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Witherite was found in large, fibrous deposits containing zones of translucent gem-quality material. If large enough, they yielded faceted pale yellow to whitish gems. Rarely, witherite occurred in clusters of translucent yellowish crystals which also yielded faceted gemstones. A typical specimen had a base value of 50gp.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Witherite gave some protection or even immunity to the withering effects of necromantic reversed healing spells and certain psionic attacks. The stone had to be mounted in a special electrum setting that allowed direct skin contact with the witherite. This was known to work for at least humans and demihumans .</p>
