<p>The Lluirwood , or the Long Forest , was a forest in Luiren .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Lluirwood made up the northern border of Luiren. The Lluirwood spanned 300 miles (480 km) east to west across Luiren and was roughly 90 miles (145 km) wide . It sat on a ridge in the shadow of the Toadsquat Mountains , making it more temperate to other forests in the Shining South .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Lluirwood was a dense forest. Originally, it covered more of the land, but after the Hin Ghostwar ended in −65 DR , the strongheart halflings cleared parts of it to make room for permanent settlements.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Lluirwood was the original homeland of all three subraces of halfling . Those three tribes ( lightfoots , stronghearts , and ghostwise ) lived nomadic lifestyles in the forest and shared its resources among themselves. Around −100 DR , a ghostwise halfling cleric named Desva began leading the ghostwise in the worship of Malar and violence, causing the forest to become a savage place and beginning the Hin Ghostwar . The war ended in −65 DR when Desva was slain and the ghostwise imposed exile on themselves to the Chondalwood . Subsequently, most of the lightfoots left the area in a diaspora across Faerûn and the stronghearts began clearing areas of the forest for permanent settlement.</p>
<p>During the events of the Spellplague , much of the forest was drowned beneath the newly created Gulf of Luiren save for the southwestern corner.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The forest was inhabited by monsters, including those that came down from the Toadsquat Mountains, including tall mouthers and trolls . Some halfling druids , rangers , and rogues called the forest home despite its dangers.</p>
<p>A plethora of dangerous creatures including stirges , spiders , snakes , large insects, and even bandits populated the eastern region of the forest. The western region of the forest was much safer thanks to the efforts of a priestess named Nola Treestump . She faced a constant struggle against the monsters and bandits who tested her boundaries whenever they could.</p>
