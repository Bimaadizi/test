<p>The Clearlight temple was a run-down temple of Tymora in Luskan . The temple took its name from the large stained glass window in the roof which, as of 1480 DR , was the only know glass window remaining in Luskan. The temple was used as the headquarters of the Coin Spinners gang and was heavily reinforced so that it resembled a fortress and the complex was heavily guarded. Most of the statuary had been removed but the idol of Tymora near the altar was more or less intact and the coin-shaped altar remained. The room leading to the inner sanctum occupied by Eden of the Clearlight was heavily trapped.</p>
