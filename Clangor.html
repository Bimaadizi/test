<p>Clangor was one of the realms of Avalas , the first layer of Acheron .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Clangor was a plane of eternal battle. Armies of goblin and kobold petitioners clashed in struggle, only to be resurrected the following dawn to start the battle again, over and over.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>It was the home plane of the gods Hruggek , Kurtulmak , and Maglubiyet .</p>
<p>Hruggek resided in Hruggekolohk , a warren of caves inhabited by small villages of hobgoblin petitioners, waging war with ambush tactics.</p>
<p>Kurtulmak lived in another warren of caves, Draukari . The caves were narrow, short, muddy, and so twisted that it was very easy to get lost and get ambushed by an angry tribe of kobolds.</p>
<p>Maglubiyet resided in a fort called Grashmog , the Heart of Battle. Grashmog served as a temple and training camp for clerics and warriors . The most feared ones were the Steelbiters , respected for their bond with the fiendish winter wolf mounts.</p>
