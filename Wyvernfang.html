<p>Wyvernfang was a large stone summit amid the Thunder Peaks located just a bit northeast of High Dale . As its name suggests, it was home to a particularly dangerous roost of wyverns .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>This mountain earned its name from the group of over a dozen wyverns, all of varying age, who called the peak their home. More specifically, their roost was located in a deep fissure near the pinnacle of the mountain, since the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<p>One of these creatures in particular demonstrated noteworthy intelligence and coordination. In addition to raiding caravans along the Thunder Way , they were rumored to capture livestock such as sheep , allow them to live and breed, and cull them as needed. Thus they had created a renewable source of food.</p>
