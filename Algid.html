<p>Algid was a small town on the shore of Hidden Lake , as part of the Netherese Empire .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Algid was situated on the southern coast of the Hidden Lake, between the Southfill River and Tarn River .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Algid was built by thirty workers in 1222 NY (−2637 DR) , and grew very slowly until 2356 NY (−1503 DR) , when it reached a peak population of one thousand inhabitants, firmly remaining a sleepy fishing village. During the Age of Discovery , the talented arcanist , Lady Polaris , approached the townsfolk and offered them enclave status. However, the residents much preferred being part of Low Netheril , and thus refused the arcanist's offer.</p>
<p>During the Shadowed Age , the inhabitants began to increase their usage of magic . Some of the residents became very skilled in the Art , and even used spells such as Yturn's levitation and Tolodine's gust of wind in order to create magical airships to patrol Hidden Lake. In 3374 NY (−485 DR) , Algid was destroyed by the phaerimm , leaving barely any alive. Those who did survive were offered residency in nearby settlements.</p>
