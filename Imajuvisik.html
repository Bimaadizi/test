<p>Imajuvisik was a village in the Alpuk region within the Great Glacier .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Imajuvisik was located between the Lugsaas Chain and Umaylu Lake . The village was found next to a crevasse roughly 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) in length and 100 yards (91 meters) in width.</p>
<h2>Layout</h2>
<p>Imajuvisik was a small village. Its snowhouses were surrounded by a wall that was built from stones from the Lugsaas Chain.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The residents of Imajuvisik were famous across Alpuk for their hardiness and hunting prowess. A rigorous regimen of physical exercise and training was part the daily routine of the villagers. They provided hunting services to other Iulutiun villages, usually to hunt dangerous predators for other villagers. The fee depended on the target. For example, if tasked with hunting down a tirichik , the hunters asked for a mating pair of kupuk , a dozen sets of seal-skin clothing, or 300 pounds (140 kilograms) of the best cuts of caribou meat. When hunting was scarce, they asked only for the carcass of the creature they hunted.</p>
<p>The villagers were very knowledgeable about the Great Glacier from their travels. They knew of the safest routes for travel and the dangers one could encounter in the wilds of the Great Glacier. They sometimes shared this information with strangers, provided they assisted the villagers in hunting the most dangerous of prey.</p>
<p>When hunting tirichik or white dragons , the hunters found a small valley surrounded by steep peaks. They tied an animal (often a caribou) to a stake within the valley as bait. The hunters hid on the high slopes of the valley's edge, waiting for their target. When the target took the bait, the hunters attacked with a volley of arrows, garnok , and spears.</p>
