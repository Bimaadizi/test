<p>Imriskril Melsamber was a self-avowed trade agent in the city of Delzimmer in southeast Faerûn circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Imriskril had an entrepreneurial spirit and a way with words. He could be very charming.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally from Lapaliiya , Imriskril Melsamber presented himself to the kala (the local adjudicators of law in Delzimmer) as a trade agent ("maevor" in the local parlance) that would represent merchants and costers in far away lands to do business in Delzimmer. The kala were perplexed about whether he could be trusted, and debated about what methods could be used to determine if he was legitimate, rather than just take him at his word. Melsamber's announcement of his intentions spawned a number of imitators among the four satrap families that controlled a large proportion of the trade in town. The kala grudgingly recognized him as a maevor for various outlander interests, but came to no conclusions about his trustworthiness.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Imriskril enjoyed a reputation with the ladies, and rumors abounded about his conquests and escapades. Two other men-about-town had similar reputations and he, Thorongh Davarrangar , and Marlyar Nilthrul , were given the dramatic title of Night Scourges. Tales of their romantic derring-do grew to street-theater proportions, replete with balcony-climbing, dangerous rooftop chases, and narrow escapes from angry husbands, jealous suitors, and even overly-willing women. Some of these wild stories were supported by certain women who wanted to grab some of the limelight for themselves or take a swipe at the reputations of their rivals. Imriskril was never found guilty of anything but boasting and vanity, but some fathers and husbands took to following him and the other Night Scourges into taverns and festhalls, giving them threatening looks and keeping their hands close to their weapons.</p>
