<p>Hesthera Draketalons was a high priestess of Tiamat in charge of her goddess's temple and operations at Castle Perilous in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Hesthera was the leader of the Handmaidens of the Undying Queen , an organization dedicated to Tiamat that maintained the Wings of the Queen Reborn cathedral beneath Castle Perilous. From there, she worked directly with her goddess's avatar to prepare to strike against Damara and its king, Gareth Dragonsbane , who had humiliated Tiamat in 1359 DR and reinvigorated the worship of her rival, Bahamut .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tiamat's plans for Castle Perilous had been set in motion as early as the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , and Hesthera and her Handmaidens became the keepers of this outpost of the Church of Tiamat sometime before the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR . As the leader and high priestess, Hesthera coordinated the collection of metallic dragon eggs and bodies to feed to her deity's terrible avatar and worked to undermine or convert members of the Cult of the Dragon .</p>
<p>During the 1370s DR, the focus of her Handmaidens turned to the creation of dragonspawn by using the old laboratories of Zhengyi the Witch-King to create the monstrous crossbreeds.</p>
