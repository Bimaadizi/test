<p>Thelgaar Ironhand was the king of Oman , on Oman's Isle in the center of the Moonshae Isles , as of the mid–14 th century DR . By the end of his reign, he was known as the mightiest of the Northlander kings. His insignia was a red dragon on a black field.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was a massive man. He had a great black beard that came to be streaked with gray in the last decade of his life.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Thelgaar had a magnetic character and carried himself as befitted a powerful ruler. He was a man of few words, often acknowledging his guests with little more than an imperious nod or hand gesture that would have seemed disrespectful from a man of lesser status. He did not deign to talk over the voices of others, instead waiting for them to be silent in his presence. His voice was loud and booming when he spoke.</p>
<p>He was not easily impressed with good food, yet he enjoyed lots of it.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Thelgaar wielded an enchanted greatsword called Ironhand's Reckoning .</p>
<p>He kept a number of servants and slaves , many of them women from far off lands.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He was born in the village of Trondhelm on Oman's Isle, and assumed the throne at Iron Keep around the turn of the 14 th century DR, when he was still quite young. On the basis of his personal strength, he managed the enormous feat of uniting the lords of Oman under his banner to form a strong and united nation.</p>
<p>After uniting the bickering lords under his banner, he later turned his attention to the giants of the Grampalt Highlands , whose raids posed the biggest threat to his reign. He was known to personally lead his soldiers against these giants.</p>
<p>In the mid–1330s DR, Thelgaar hosted Elminster and King Grunnarch of Norland at his Iron Keep . He subsequently accompanied the pair of them on a voyage to Garhelm , where they arrived to find pirates attacking the city while the local warriors were out at sea. The berserkers of Oman and Norland made short work of the buccaneers.</p>
<p>After nearly five decades in power, Thelgaar had cemented himself as the most powerful ruler of the most powerful Northman kingdom in the Moonshaes. No organized resistance remained on Oman's Isle to threaten him or his people, and so his attention had turned to driving back the firbolgs who menaced his subjects on Gwynneth . By this time, he had come to believe that his people's future lay in peace and trade rather than war and raiding.</p>
<p>In Mirtul of the Year of the Saddle, 1345 DR , several Northlander kings—including Grunnarch the Red of Norland and Raag Hammerstaad of Norheim —brought their hosts of longships to Thelgaar Ironhand's Iron Keep on Oman's Isle to prepare an attack on the southern Moonshae Isles . In the first council of northern Kings and Captains, Thelgaar announced his intention of making long lasting peace with the Ffolk and start a prosperous trading relationship. Most of the warriors that were present did not agree and decided to continue with the plan of raiding and pillaging the cities of Caer Corwell and Caer Callidyrr and the rest of the Ffolk lands. The same night, Thelgar was slain by Kazgoroth who took the identity of the king and carried on with the plan to attack Caer Corwell.</p>
<p>He was buried in a cairn within the Old Stone Wood .</p>
