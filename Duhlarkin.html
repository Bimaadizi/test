<p>A duhlarkin was any creature created through the use of the Duhlark's animerge spell .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Since Duhlark's animerge allowed the caster to fuse two different creatures into one new creature that possessed physical traits of both, the description of a duhlarkin varied greatly.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>The type of physical attacks that a duhlarkin was capable of depended on the physical attributes it acquired from its "parent" creatures.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>The general behavior of a duhlarkin was similar to that of the dominant creature used during its creation. A duhlarkin was capable of reproducing by mating with either of the creatures it was related to. The offspring from these unions were stillborn a quarter of the time, resulted in a duhlarkin a quarter of the time, and resulted in the pure creature half of the time. A pair of mating duhlarkins would result in a stillborn half of the time and duhlarkin half of the time.</p>
