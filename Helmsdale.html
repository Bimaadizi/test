<p>Helmsdale was a small farming town found in the Duchy of Soravia in Damara .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Helmsdale rested on the banks of the Goliad River south of Ironspur near Soravia's border with Brandiar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Zhengyi the Witch-King used Helmsdale as his base of operations beginning during the Vaasan War as well as throughout the entire duration of the Bloodstone Wars , with his forces being fully expelled before the end of the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , with the help of forces from Ironspur .</p>
<p>Because of the town's longstanding association with Zhengyi's undead forces, many Damarans often referred to Helmsdale as "the cursed village" in the mid 14 th century DR .</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , Helmsdale was home to one of the former wives of King Yarin Frostmantle . After she bore a daughter following her split with the king, the spiteful monarch ordered the child to be killed. She was saved by the intervention of Showithal Terdidy , a member of the Kneebreakers , who subsequently fled the realm to avoid the king's wrath.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>This small farming community hosted a population of 500 inhabitants who produced food in support of the dwarves of Ironspur. The population swelled to 4,000 when Zhengyi's forces occupied the town. Only 78 of the original inhabitants survived to see the Witch-King's defeat. Most of these folk remained stubbornly determined to stay and make a living in the village.</p>
