<p>Shar Nadal was a drow warrior of House Maevret in Menzoberranzan .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1328 DR , Shar Nadal was a member of a drow patrol that traveled to the surface in a raid on the surface elves. During the raid, an elven woman ran towards Drizzt Do'Urden , who intended to help her (although it appeared that he was about to attack her), but Shar Nadal jumped in and killed the woman instead. When Shar Nadal later boasted of his kill, Drizzt punched him, which the others believed was to repay him for stealing Drizzt's kill.</p>
