<p>Shepherd's charms were minor enchanted lenses used by some of the shepherds of the Wild Pastures of Liam's Hold .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This magic item was a small broken piece of glass that formed a lens, tied to a shabby handle made out of wood.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1372 DR , a shepherd's charm belonged to a young shepherd from the Wild Pastures. She believed that the dreaded Old One-Eye was behind the disappearances of her cattle, even though no-one believed her. The shepherd, named Lavna , offered the magic trinket to anyone brave enough to slay the worg and bring her his head.</p>
