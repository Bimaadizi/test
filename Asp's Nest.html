<p>Asp's Nest was a type of an enchanted poisoned dart that was used by members of shadowy organizations such as Shadow Thieves and Xanathar's Thieves' Guild .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Asp's Nest darts' tips were covered in rows of fangs that delivered poison upon hit in a similar manner to how venom was injected by a snake 's bite. These darts possessed a +1 magical enchantment, and the poison inside typically was affecting the target's constitution.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Asp's Nest's name was given to multiple different, but similar in design and effect darts.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some theorized that these darts originated from Reghedmen or Uthgardt of the north.</p>
<p>A version of the Asp's Nest was created by Fargon Fol of Shadow Thieves. She spent all of her time collecting copious amounts of poisonous snakes and transforming them into the darts with the magic. Her version of the Asp's Nest darts turned back into snakes upon hit, injecting the victim with its venom.</p>
<p>In 1368 DR , Asp's Nest darts were in Shadow Thieves' arsenal.</p>
<p>In 1369 DR , these darts were available to purchase from Ribald Barterman in Athkatla 's Temple District.</p>
<p>In 1372 DR , a member of Xanathar's Thieves' Guild, Nakoto along with her fellow thieves, were armed with these darts, while dealing with Matagar Bugo of Daggerford .</p>
