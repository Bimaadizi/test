<p>Lareth Huntsilver was a member of the noble house of Huntsilver in Cormyr around the turn of the 11 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lareth was a handsome, thin man with pale blond hair and a thin mustache.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Lareth had a dry wit and was known for making sardonic observations. He was quite the ladies' man, often wooing several different women rather than concentrating on one at a time. However, he eventually settled down and married a commoner.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was good friends with Halartan Wyvernspur and reveled in imparting droll comments timed to elicit a snort or sputter that sent his drink out his nose.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lareth was one of the four men that discovered the so-called Harp of Healing in the Year of the Dracorage, 1018 DR . He, along with Gardrath Roaringhorn , Aubleth Crownsilver , and Aiken Wyvernspur , were walking home to Suzail after a night of merrymaking when they chanced upon a roadside clearing and a softly glowing, floating harp that was playing music. Various commoners were coming out of the forest to touch the harp and apparently being healed of their sicknesses or wounds before disappearing back into the trees. The four companions decided to take the mysterious instrument to Suzail and they did so without incident, but the harp fell dark and silent when they touched it and remained that way whenever any of the four came near it again. Many spells were cast on the harp and the four men to investigate the strange behavior, but few conclusions were able to be drawn from the results.</p>
<p>Lareth eventually married Roatha Ildraen , the daughter of an innkeeper. He became the Seneschal of Turnstone , a fortified complex on Calantar's Way between Immersea and Arabel , where he raised horses and prospered. He and his wife had three blonde daughters that once threw apples at Elminster Aumar . For their impudence, each of the three got their heads soaked by a sphere of water levitated from a nearby horse pond.</p>
