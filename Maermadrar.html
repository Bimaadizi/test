<p>The Maermadrar was an archmage of Sheirtalar in Lapaliiya of the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<p>Stern and powerful, the Maermadrar had his own tower and a lot of apprentices. One of them was a rather obnoxious novice named Holbert Gruth, who one night stole two spellbooks and a small coffer filled with wands , sneaked out of the tower, changed his name to Qilder Yarven and went into hiding in the Border Kingdoms to evade from the Maermadrar's anger. Some years later, in 1317 DR , Qilder briefly became the Magister .</p>
