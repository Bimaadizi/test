<p>Lady Arden Thurlow was a lady of fine breeding in an arranged marriage with the speaker of Lonelywood , Baldemar Thurlow of the Ten Towns in the late 13 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Arden was a human woman with a fair complexion who wore the fanciful dresses of a noblewoman.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Lady Thurlow was a woman of refined taste and uppity attitude. Even though she lived in the largest home in Lonelywood at the time, she thought it to be a shack. She could not stand local riffraff tracking mud all over her expensive carpets. She did not enjoy boorish traveling merchants visiting her home to exchange coin with Baldemar.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Arden Thurlow entered an arranged marriage with Baldemar Thurlow, an opportunistic man, away from the freezing Icewind Dale. Baldemar was a cartwright who made a fortune by supplying caravan wagons for the costers in northwest Faerûn . She could have never imagined that the marriage would result in her living in the smallest of the frontier Ten Towns . By the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , Arden's husband took on the position of the representative of Lonelywood's merchants and tradesmen, a profitable stature that made him the town's speaker. Subsequently, the town of Lonelywood became menaced by a barbarian army led by Wylfdene . Instead of trying to settle the crisis peacefully, speaker Baldemar hired an assassin to end Wylfdene's life. Purvis , the assassin, however, was unable to fulfill the contract. When the word of the assassin got out, the barbarian camp doubled the guard, making Wylfdene unreachable. As the adventurers investigated the threat, Wylfdene's true identity was revealed, and the barbarian was put to the sword. Unwilling to gain the reputation of a failure, Purvis assassinated Speaker Thurlow, Arden Thurlow, and just needed to finish off the last witnesses of his failure – the Heroes of Icewind Dale .</p>
