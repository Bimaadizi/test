<p>The Olophyn House was a wealthy and powerful bloodline that jointly ruled Khôltar , the Iron City, as part of the Onsruur (council of lords), circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Olophyns were a healthy and attractive group of self-proclaimed nobles descended from Tethyrian commoners that emigrated to the Iron City in the early centuries of the town's existence. They quickly created a coat of arms and comported themselves in a courtly manner, maintaining they were "true nobility" while looking down at the other prominent families in the Onsruur as pretenders. Their attitude never wavered and their disdain was reciprocated with equal vehemence.</p>
<p>The family sport was hunting humans on horseback with lances in the wilderness. They also collected (and wore) magic armor with as many powers as they could find.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>This clan made their fortune in the slave trade, and by manufacturing and dealing in arms and armor.</p>
