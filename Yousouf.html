<p>Yousouf was a Netherese fighter who worked as an adventurer and later as a grocer in Karsus Enclave until its destruction in 3520 NY (−339 DR) .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Yousouf plied his trade as an adventurer, but decided to retire after a particularly ill-fated expedition. He lost his shield-hand to an ogre 's blade, had half of his intestines eaten by a mountain lion while lying atop a glacier waiting for death, and then suffered frostbite on most of his toes as he was dragged to Yeoman's Loft by his rescuers.</p>
<p>His friend Ihre came to his aid and used healing magic to save his life, but was only partially successful in curing his many wounds. Although Yousouf survived, his toes had to be amputated to avoid gangrene . Yousouf decided to quit the adventuring business while he still lived, and went on to run Yousouf's Grocery in Karsus Enclave.</p>
