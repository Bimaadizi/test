<p>The Vel'Nikeryma (or Blade Lords ) was the organization that acted as the guiding council for the Eldreth Veluuthra . Its purpose was to gather information from across Faerûn in order to dictate the direction of the Eldreth Veluuthra but, in general, they avoided intervention in individual cells' matters.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Although the organization was originally led by members of its five founding families, as of 1374 DR , this was no longer the case, and the leadership was determined by voting amongst its most powerful members.</p>
<h2>Recruitment</h2>
<p>Recruitment into the Vel'Nikeryma was through the Eldreth Veluuthra. An established member could apply to become an agent and be granted a sort of free-roaming status in Faerûn. An agent would be expected to gather information and pay a portion of his or her treasure to superiors, in exchange for knowledge of the organization's passcodes, handshakes and symbols. An agent would be able to seek supplies and shelter from a cell of the Eldreth Veluuthra, and only if the agent's stay exceeded a tenday or demands were very high could the cell's leader demand a task be carried out.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Around 1374 DR, agents were sent on treasure hunts to the House of Stone , a ruin near the edge of the Ardeep Forest . They were also tasked with locating the ancient Myth Rhynn and restoring its mythal .</p>
<p>On Evermeet , the organization was responsible for gathering information and subverting sun elf families.</p>
<h2>Members as of 1374 DR</h2>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1374 DR, a female member of the organization was killed by the daemonfey in the High Forest , where it was keen to gain more information about the human settlement called Olostin's Hold .</p>
