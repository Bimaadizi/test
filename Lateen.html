<table border='1'><tr><th>Type</th><td>Sail</td></tr></table><br>
<p>A lateen was a style of sail used on various ships across Faerûn and Zakhara . Some Zakharans mistakenly believed that this style of sail was unique to ships in the Land of Fate and not found anywhere else on Toril . Ships that sported a lateen sail were referred to as "lateen-rigged".</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Unlike most sails in Faerûn, which took on a rectangular shape, lateens were triangular. This shape allowed lateens to remain effective at sizes larger than rectangular sails and enabled ships to sail more windward.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>In the city of Waterdeep , the Most Diligent League of Sail-makers and Cordwainers sold lateen sails of "standard" dimensions for around 500 to 700 gold pieces , though could lower those prices by thirty percent if several months' notice were given. Some Waterdhavians unaffiliated with the guild sold sails for as low as 200 gold pieces, though they carried no guarantees.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The existence of lateens on Toril dated as far back as the Netherese Empire , where they saw some use on small caravels used to sail the Narrow Sea .</p>
