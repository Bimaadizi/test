<p>Lord Ildool was the Crown's representative in Marsember , Cormyr . He was widely distrusted because of his alleged dishonesty about taxes, and the Harpers were keeping him in check. Ildool lived at the King's Tower . He often met with trade delegations from other states such as Sembia , and he was rumoured to be on friendly terms with Thay . Ildool was also rumoured to use the apparently disused shrine to Waukeen as a covert meeting place. He was replaced by Bledryn Scoril after he died sometime between 1368 DR and 1372 DR .</p>
