<p>Mountain wemics were a rumored species of monstrous tauric beasts, distantly related to the wemics of Faerûn 's grasslands.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mountain wemics were said to resemble great mountain lions with the upper torso of a humanoid . They were smaller in frame than common wemics, and their males lacked manes.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>The existence of mountain wemics was little more than rumor as of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , but they were said to be found in dangerous regions throughout the Thunder Peaks and Desertsmouth Mountains in central Faerûn .</p>
<p>They culturally differed from their more abundant cousins in a number of ways. They were not nomadic pack hunters, but rather solitary creatures that hunted alone or in pairs. Their preferred weapon was the club .</p>
