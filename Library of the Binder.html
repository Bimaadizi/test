<p>The Library of the Binder was an Oghmanyte temple in the city-state of Saelmur .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Helm, 1362 DR , an order of Banite crusaders known as the Knights of the Black Gauntlet conquered and occupied the neighboring city-state of Mintar . Many Oghmanytes fled from Mintar in its fall, escaping to the Library of the Binder in Saelmur. There they donated to the temple's library whatever books and scrolls of faith, knowledge, or music that they had managed to carry with them.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR the Library of the Binder's clergy were frequently pressuring their high priest , Presman Taliemin , to rally aid to the Oghmanytes who were operating a resistance movement in Mintar against the Knights of the Black Gauntlet.</p>
