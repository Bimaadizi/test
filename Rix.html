<p>Rix was a kobold from the Dragon's Rest cloister in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Rix's strong religious devotion to Bahamut led her to maintain his temple, taking on the role of elder Runara 's assistant. Rix also adored puns.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Rix shared with three other kobolds a small monastic cell in the Dragon's Rest cloister cut into the cliff face. Each of the four slept on individual hammocks. Just like all the other kobolds, she worked at night because of their sensitivity to sunlight.</p>
<p>Circa the Year of the Grinning Halfling, 1481 DR , Rix and Varnoth witnessed the wrecking of a ship to the north of the cloister, in the area around the wreck of Compass Rose .</p>
