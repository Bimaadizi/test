<p>PJ Stubbs was sailor and a friend of Bosun Gannet of the Blushing Mermaid tavern in Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , during the Absolute crisis , PJ Stubbs sailed to the nation of Calimshan , south of Baldur's Gate. There, he visited a popular local watering hole â€“ The Copper Tap , the establishment that gave him the worst night of his life, worse than an incident with a bear in Chult . The Copper Tap was known for its own award-winning brews, yet when PJ tried one, he described the taste as "flowers having a wank on his tongue." Even after drinking ten pints of ale did not clear the taste out. The sailor told of the misadventure in a letter addressed to Bosun Gannet and asked the barkeep to prepare a couple of barrels of drinks for PJ's next visit that was sure to wash the flower taste out at last.</p>
