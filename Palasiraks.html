<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR, Kya Mordrayn and Palasiraks's and Marjon's father, Pelendralaar, led the Cult of the Dragon to occupy the ruined city of Myth Drannor . The cultists intended on using the raw magical power of the pool of radiance under the Castle Cormanthor to infect the cities in the Moonsea with the pool's corrupting soul-consuming magic and empower the dracolich by submerging him into the pool's depths.</p>
<p>Palasiraks followed her father into Myth Drannor, and she laired in the Elven Catacombs connected to the subterranean levels of Castle Cormanthor. She could often be found not far from the chamber where the pool of radiance was located, and Pelendralaar's phylactery was kept, standing guard in front of her father's underground lair.</p>
<p>Soon after the resurrections of the corrupted pools , two independent groups of heroes found themselves opposing the cult. One of the groups managed to infiltrate Castle Cormanthor and destroy Pelendralaar's phylactery , allowing the other group, the Veiled Ones , to slay Palasiraks's father and defeat Kya Mordrayn. Palasiraks was alerted by the sounds of struggle echoing through the catacombs and peeked into the pool chamber. The young dragon hissed at the intruding adventurers, promising them Pelendralaar's vengeance and left conflict unscathed.</p>
<h2>Rumors and Legends</h2>
<p>It was rumored that following the destruction of her undead father, Palasiraks embarked on a quest to find and slay the adventurers that were instrumental in the fall of Pelendralaar. The Veiled Ones and the adventurers that passed through the gate in Darnarest's tower were the targets of her hunt.</p>
