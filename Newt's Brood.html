<p>The Newt's Brood was a witch coven responsible for creation of the set of enchanted chainmail called the Zeal's Walk .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before 1372 DR , the ladies of the Newt's Brood found them selves a lover in an especially good-looking ranger , Tholan the Beautiful . The witches' paramour often traveled to far away lands and was gone for long periods of time, so the Newt's Brood created the Zeal's Walk to keep track of their wayward consort. Eventually, Tholan married another, an elven woman. To avoid the witches' scorn, the ranger disposed of the magic chainmail, leaving the Newt's Brood unaware of the betrayal.</p>
