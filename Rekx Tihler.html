<p>Rekx Tihler was the Silhouette of Bounty Hunters for the Shadow Thieves in Riatavin around 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>In his role as Silhouette, Rekx was one of the guildmasters under Cloakmaster Kiirma Blackmane . Rekx planned to assassinate Lord Zelphar Thann in order to advance his position in the guild. Kiirma, however, was against this plan, unless Rekx find a way to disguise the assassination as an accident or illness or anything but an assassination, because such a high-profile action would cause too much trouble. Rekx continued to develop his plot, despite warnings and even threats from Kiirma. Recently, Kiirma considered removing one of Rekx's feet until he submitted to her.</p>
