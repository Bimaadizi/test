<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 1490s DR , the Absolution Council—Voss Anderton, Jil Torbo , Kriv Norixius , and a delayed Jarnathan —met in Revel's End to consider a pardon for Edgin Darvis and Holga Kilgore for the crimes of skulduggery and grand larceny. Anderton opened the meeting and listened quietly through Edgin's statement, despite his many breaks and stalling. Ultimately, though, the Council approved their pardon, the pair escaped by fighting off the guards, grabbing Jarnathan, and jumping through the window before they could announce it.</p>
<p>More than a year later, the same council met to consider Forge Fitzwilliam for pardon, but were wise to the same tricks and refused him.</p>
