<p>Okuzo was an immigrant from the island nation of Wa who ran a small business of importing items, weapons, perfumes , and spices from Kara-Tur to Westgate in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Okuzo was a proper, friendly, and polite woman who greeted her customers with a serene and mannered smile.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>When she emigrated to Westgate, Okuzo brought along an heirloom that belonged to her family for many generations – an immaculate statue of Emperor Kochi , the mythological first emperor of the island nation of Wa . The statue was proudly displayed at the center of her shop – Okuzo's Imports , located on the Harbor Loop in Westgate.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Okuzo sought to make her own way in the world, and she decided to leave her home in Wa. She loved her homeland but was frustrated by not being able to pursue her own path there and by the nation's isolationist culture and resistance to change. Okuzo's father did not understand her drive and passion, but when she left, he insisted that the woman take the Statue of Kochi, a family heirloom, in hopes that it would make Okuzo miss home and drive her to return. However, that was not to be as many years later, she still resided in Westgate.</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Okuzo's very appearance betrayed the strife she found herself in. Despite her friendly and police appearance was contrasted by a brutal welt below her right eye. One of the customers who witnessed the woman's battered face was an adventurer who had recently arrived at Westgate to investigate the origin of a mysterious magical mask. When asked about the welt, Okuzo dismissed it as just a price of doing business in Westgate and that the wound bothered her little, which was a polite lie, evident by her self-conscious body language and speech. Okuzo was ashamed to ask for help, especially from a customer, but she shared the story with them.</p>
<p>Ever since Okuzo opened her shop on the Harbor Loop, local merchants paid the newcomer little mind. Initially, Okuzo just sold weapons and curios from Wa and Kara-Tur, but when she expanded her business to dealing in a significant share of fragrances and spices, one of the Westgate's merchant family took heed. House Urdo sized up the lone merchant and took her as competition. A member of the Urdo clan, Dallia Urdo , attempted to buy Okuzo's business out, but she refused. Soon after, just a few days before the adventurer's arrival, a member of House Urdo came to the store with henchmen to intimidate Okuzo into selling. When she refused once again, she was backhanded with a ring-wearing hand, leaving a painful welt. The goons left, but not before promising to return later to continue "negotiations."</p>
<p>Reluctantly, Okuzo agreed to accept support from a powerful adventurer who volunteered to negotiate with Dallia Urdo at her family's estate facing the Market Triangle . However, Okuzo left the adventurer with a word of warning: Dallia was a young and dangerous woman who would go any distance to take control of House Urdo one day. Dallia also recruited several talented gladiators to be her bodyguards from Westgate's own Quivering Thumb arena.</p>
