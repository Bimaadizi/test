<p>Lukyan Lyonsbane was a member of the Lyonsbane family and the first to discover the curse that afflicted the men of their lineage.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Lukyan was the grandson of Kyle Lyonsbane , the selfish mercenary that caused many of his male descendants to suffer from lycanthropy , along with senility and other mental health issues.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Lukyan's father grew older, the senior Lyonsbane became unable to recall how and when he was to be rewarded for jobs he completed. These mental lapses caused him to inadvertently trigger the Lyonsbane family curse: whenever they performed a deed for material gain, they would transform into a great and vicious panther .</p>
<p>Due to the grave danger this combination placed upon innocents, Lukyan was forced to slay his own father. This started a generations-long tradition that each Lyonsbane man would be cut down by his own son upon turning 50 years old.</p>
