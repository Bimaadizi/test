<p>The Shadovar , sometimes pluralized as Shadovars , were the inhabitants of Thultanthar , also known as the City of Shade. During the course of the people's 1700-year exile from Toril , they battled the malaugrym and other shadowy horrors of the Plane of Shadow , before returning in the late 14 th century DR and reestablishing a Netherese presence in Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>The term "Shadovar" meant "of the shades" in Loross .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Shadovar had many skilled wizards and powerful sorcerers among their number, spellcasters that were predominantly referred to as arcanists . They held practitioners of the arcane arts in the highest regard, especially those that wielded the powers of shadow magic .</p>
<p>They used their arcane powers to scry the entirety of Faerûn , constantly examining and scrutinizing their new neighbors on the Prime Material plane . Arcanists continually experimented with and improved their Art , often against unwilling subjects.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<h3>Beliefs</h3>
<p>They believed that Anauroch was their undisputed domain, and used their spells to keep the sandstorms of the desert at bay. They sought to make the desert of Anauroch fertile as it was during the days of ancient Netheril . The leaders of Thultanthar even resorted to reshaping weather patterns across all of northern Faerûn, regardless of the destruction it would cause in the surrounding Realms.</p>
<h3>Culture</h3>
<p>The Shadovar were a strong-willed people that tolerated no opposition to their ambitions. They were reclusive and arrogant, believing themselves destined for greatness and superior to the "weak and worthless" masses of the Realms. Conversely, Shadovar culture was seen as domineering and warlike by others.</p>
<p>It was the goal of many devoted Shadovar to undergo transformation into a shade , at the discretion of the Princes of Shade .</p>
<p>All Shadovar spoke the ancestral language of ancient Netheril, while some few learned the Common trade tongue of the Realms.</p>
<p>Most Shadovar were forbidden from leaving Thultanthar without escort, save for the cases of military officers or the princes themselves.</p>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>The Shadovar dedicated the entirety of their society to the veneration of Shar , and relied exclusively upon her blessing over any other false deity. Worship of the Lady of Loss in Thultanthar had endured for over a millennia and a half, predating the enclave's entrance to the Plane of Shadow.</p>
<p>While all Shadovar paid service to Shar, not all could be considered "true believers". Some merely used their faith as a means to achieve their own personal ambitions.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Their weapons and armaments were considered antiques, which was appropriate considering their centuries-long absence from Toril.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Telamont Tanthul moved Thultanthar to the Plane of Shadow, their mythal was infused with the power of the Shadow Weave and protected by the goddess Shar. After centuries in the Plane of Shadow, the ruling class of the City of Shade became twisted, dark, humanoid creatures referred to as shades . Regardless of class, the souls of all Shadovar were changed by their centuries in the shadow.</p>
<p>On Hammer 1 of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Thultanthar returned to the Realms above the Dire Wood , later moving to hover over the Shoal of Thirst in the Anauroch desert. The Shadovar people rapidly joined the fight against the terrible phaerimm , that had left the elven city of Evereska under siege. Over the course of months, the folk of the Realms came to view the Shadovar as benevolent saviors, while others were still mistrusting of their intent. The auspicious circumstances of the Shadovar's return were soon tarnished when their new vision for Faerûn was revealed to neighboring heads of state.</p>
<p>In response to this growing opposition from the nation of Cormyr and organizations like the Harpers , the Shadovar and their Sharran agents placed Faerûnian spies and agents in positions of power across the Realms. Over the years, allies of the Shadovar would infiltrates numerous cities across the Realms, including several of those in the Silver Marches , the city of Selgaunt in Sembia , and Helm's Hold .</p>
<p>The Shadovar people began excavations across Anauroch and the Western Heartlands , looking for long-lost repositories of ancient Netherese lore or artifacts from the Empire of Magic. Over time, the Shadovar once again came to be known among others as Netherese, and the terms became largely interchangeable, even if not entirely accurate.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>In the years following the return of Thultanthar, people from across the Heartlands whispered amongst themselves that one day the Shadovar would conquer Cormyr , the Silver Marches or the Dalelands , while being protected from the harsh Anauroch around them. These pessimistic folks prophesied the Anauroch desert would be overrun by terrible monsters, tyrannical wizards, and horrific undead.</p>
