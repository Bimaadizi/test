<p>Cernd Shattermind was a hybrid illithid dwarf living in Iltkazar in the year 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Cernd was a member of Clan Arnskull . In his youth, he was captured by the mind flayers of Oryndoll and bought to their city as a mind-thrall. Cernd lived there for many years as a slave miner until his broken body became too unfit.</p>
<p>He was then selected as a subject for ceremorphosis , which was unusual because dwarves were considered unsuitable for the procedure. In fact, the ceremorphois failed, resulting in an individual that half resembled a dwarf and half an illithid and with the personality of Cernd intact.</p>
<p>Cernd managed to escape back to Iltkazar. Here, thank to the intercession of the high priest of Dumathoin , Bettargh Stoneshoulder , the Regency Council allowed Cernd to live in the city, albeit under discrete but constant supervision.</p>
