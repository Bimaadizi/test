<p>Juz'la was a tainted one and independent spy of Skullport and Waterdeep in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Juz'la was born and raised in Skullport. From a young age, she made a living as a freelance spy and sold secrets for coin.</p>
<p>However, she drew the ire of the yuan-ti slaver Zstulkk Ssarmn , who captured her, trained her as a sorcerer , and finally turned her into a tainted one. Zstulkk used Juz'la as a spy to infiltrate the church of Cyric , but she converted truly to the worship of Cyric and for some time worked as a double agent. When her master learned of her duplicity, she managed to escape to the surface.</p>
<p>Circa 1372 DR , Juz'la worked as a minor spy lord on behalf of a number of Waterdhavian merchants and guilds .</p>
