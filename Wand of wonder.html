<p>A wand of wonder was an unpredictable magical wand that produced a random effect each time it was used.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The wand could be aimed at a creature, an object, or any point in space. Activating the wand caused it to create a random effect that could possibly target the wielder, the pointed creature or object, or an area in front of the wand. It could be activated up to seven times a day, after which it gradually recovered its powers at dawn on subsequent days. If all the power of a wand of wonder was used up in a single day, there was a small chance that it would crumble to dust and be destroyed.</p>
<p>The wand of wonder was capable of producing a number of different outcomes, each with a different probability to happen. They included casting spells that affected a single creature, such as detect thoughts , enlarge/reduce , flesh to stone , invisibility , and slow ; spells that affected an entire area, such as darkness , faerie fire , fireball , gust of wind , lightning bolt , and stinking cloud ; and other effects, such as turning the wielder's skin blue, summoning a large animal or a swarm of butterflies , making grass or leaves grow, causing rain, stunning the wielder, banishing objects into the Ethereal plane , and creating a violent burst of either gems or colorful light, among others.</p>
<h2>Notable Wands of Wonder</h2>
<p>A wand of wonder was created by a whimsical wizard named Malimak sometime before 1369 DR , as a gift prank for his rival. The outcomes of the prank were unknown as Malimak moved away soon after the gift was made.</p>
<p>The wizard Rantantar , one of Halaster Blackcloak 's oldest apprentices, bound his spirit to his wand of wonder after his death. The spirit could animate and discharge the wand at random creatures.</p>
