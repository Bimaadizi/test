<p>The Conclave was a secret organization within the Council of Elders of Halruaa that enforced the laws regarding the practice, research, and misuse of magic in the nation. It was not an official political or governmental group, but rather an elite secret society.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The membership of the Conclave was a complete mystery to everyone outside their ranks. While others knew of their existence, they did not know their identities. Nevertheless, they were thought to comprise the greatest of Halruaan mages, as well as the most ambitious.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Whenever the experiments, conduct, or other actions of a wizard in Halruaa became unrestrained, the Conclave would intervene. They began with a warning, usually in the form of sending a simple note advising the wizard to refrain from continued abuse of magic. If the offenses continued, then other ways to correct their behavior were explored. Exceptionally prideful or defiant spellcasters were widely thought to be eliminated or simply made to disappear.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Although a secret society, the Conclave was well known and was respected and feared by every Halruaan.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Given its secrecy, the origins of the Conclave were unknown. It was commonly presumed to have been established not long after Netherese settlement in the region, following the Fall of Netheril in the Year of Sundered Webs, −339 DR . Presuming this was true, their purpose was to guarantee there could never be another disaster on the scale of Karsus's Folly .</p>
<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>A few in Halruaa considered the Conclave to be more than a mere supervisory entity, and feared they had greater ambitions—even to gain control over the Netyarch and the Council of Elders of the magical nation, if they did not have it already.</p>
<p>Worse still, around 1372 DR , there were insinuations of a link between the Conclave and the purported spread of shadow magic in the realm. However, many rumors instead alleged a cult of Shadow Weave magic users lurked among the Elders and was plotting to take over Halruaa, and almost half of these rumors claimed the Conclave countered their activities and would unmask and depose them any day now, while the rest maintained the two secret societies were in alliance, if not identical, with their different deeds a deception. Meanwhile, the majority of folk thought half these rumors to be propaganda created by one or the other side as part of their secret conflict, both against each other and the common mages of Halruaa.</p>
