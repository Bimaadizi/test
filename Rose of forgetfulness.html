<p>A rose of forgetfulness was a dangerous enchanted flower found in Zakhara , the Land of Fate.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Inhaling the aroma of these flowers caused forgetfulness and memory loss. If a wizard or spellcaster inhaled this aroma they would forget a memorized spell for every minute they lingered near the flower. To make matters worse, the wizard did not realize the spell was lost until they attempted to cast it.</p>
<p>Anyone unlucky enough to inhale directly from a rose of forgetfulness would experience complete amnesia–forgetting their identity and losing any previously learned skills or abilities.</p>
<p>Both the amnesia and other memory loss was permanent unless cured by a wish , heal , or restoration spell.</p>
<p>A rose of forgetfulness would retain its dangerous properties for 1–6 weeks after being cut from its bush.</p>
