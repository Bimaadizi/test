<p>Varsh Ko'kuu was a githyanki youth caretaker from Crèche Y'llek , on Toril during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ko'kuu was a lanky githyanki with white hair and well-trimmed facial hair. He wore a sophisticated collection of lenses that formed an ocular device on his left eye.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Varsh Ko'kuu was armed with a large crossbow of githyanki design. He also wore a pair of enchanted boots that protected him from the acidic pools in the Crèche Y'llek hatchery.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Varsh Ko'kuu, along with other gith of what would become Crèche Y'llek, attacked and claimed the Rosymorn Monastery of Lathander in the Western Heartlands of West Faerûn sometime before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . Soon after, the function of Crèche was changed as the githyanki war against the mind flayers in Faerûn shifted in balance. Varsh Ko'kuu was in charge of githyanki eggs, personally creating the entire hatchery. Ko'kuu's opinions on the young clashed with others, especially Kith'rak Therezzyn , as he was not willing to discard delayed unhatched eggs, believing that even a "weak" gith could hold greatness. This belief was personal. Ko'kuu himself was the last hatchling of his clutch and was close to being drowned in the hatchery acid, so he wholeheartedly believed that not all late haltings were weak.</p>
<p>Varsh was desperate to save the last unhatched egg in 1492 DR and could be convinced to give it up to Lady Esther , an adventurer employed by the Society of Brilliance , the organization that sought to prove that nurture trumped nature by raising a githyanki from birth to being good.</p>
