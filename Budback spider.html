<p>Budback spiders were vermin from the Khopet-Dag mountains in the Hordelands .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These spiders were about the size of a human thumb.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Budback spiders liked to bite whenever they were annoyed. They were poisonous , but their poison was not harmful, not even if dozens of them were involved. It took a whole swarm of them biting for their poison to incapacitate a man. However, they did not swarm naturally, though magic could compel them to form such a swarm.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On the night of Tarsakh 15 , in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the druid Berun used budback spiders to incapacitate several assassins .</p>
