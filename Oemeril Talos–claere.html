<p>Lord Oemeril Talos–claere was a Llewyrr Marchlord of Synnoria on the island of Gwynneth in the Moonshae Isles during the late 15 th century DR . He protected the valley's northern border.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>His features were beautiful, handsome, and delicate, and his fingernails were long and curved. His voice was melodious and melancholic.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He dearly cared for the sanctity of the land which he protected, and ruefully regarded it as polluted if any non- fey entered its woods. He assumed that all non-Llewyrr were slaves , and treated them as such. He was utterly oblivious to the emotions and sarcasm of humans .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He dressed in scale armor and carried both a sword and a thin, curved knife used to cut a mark into intruders' flesh so as to broadcast their crime to any who saw them.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He had a cousin (his mother's brother's son) named Askepel , who served as a leader in the Knights of Synnoria .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 1470s DR, a human named Rurik and a gnome named Suka accidentally trespassed into Synnoria while fleeing a wyvern attack. Although they just barely crossed the border and turned to leave immediately, they were intercepted by Lord Talos–claere and two of his associates. Talos–claere informed them that they had polluted the land and that no words or deeds could remedy the crime they had committed, and all there was to do was to mark them as trespassers and (as he presumed them to be slaves given too much leeway to wander) to find and punish their master. As he approached Rurik to cut a mark into him, Rurik stabbed him with a hidden dagger , then took his sword and slew one of the other elves while Suka dispatched the third. The pair fled the scene immediately, but the Llewyrr claimed to be able to detect the smell of a man and a gnome in the aftermath, and to smell Talos–claere's blood on Suka. Talos–claere's cousin, Lord Askepel, therefore attempted to detain Suka to bring her to justice in Synnoria, although he failed. She would ultimately escape Gwynneth with her comrades.</p>
