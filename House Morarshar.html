<p>House Morarshar was a wealthy family of the city of Selgaunt in Sembia . They lived in Morarshar Hall within the city.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the early 14 th century DR , the family matriarch, Lady Ambrele Morarshar, brought success and riches to the house. But she was in fact the villainous steel dragon Rauvrahrileenatandrar in disguise. Then, one day, there arrived a band of undercover Harpers led by one Shalant Mornwindâ€”Rauvrahreene's own brother Velsaertirden , the only survivor of the family she'd murdered. The two dragons fought, destroying not only Morarshar Hall but several neighboring buildings and much of the street, and causing the deaths of the Morarshars, their employees, and the Harpers in the process. Both dragons escaped, badly wounded but alive.</p>
