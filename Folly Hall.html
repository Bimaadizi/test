<p>Folly Hall was a partially-built manor turned ruin near Thunderstone in Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The site lay a quarter-day ride south-southeast of Thunderstone in the East Reaches of Cormyr , near a dozen farmsteads.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>After being abandoned, the Hall consisted of heaps of piled earth, an excavated pit, and a single partially-built front wall with tall arched windows, lined with supporting wooden buttresses and scaffolding that sagged and decayed in time.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The wealthy non-noble Varvrail family of Suzail bought the land near Thunderstone, including the dozen nearby farms, intending to build a grand manorial Varvrail Hall there. After poor investments led to the family becoming impoverished and crimes led to some being arrested, the building site was abandoned and their assets seized. The lands were sold off, as was the supply of timber and dressed stone at the prospective Hall. The earthworks and partial construction was named Folly Hall by the locals afterwards.</p>
