<p>The Mantle was a series of passages and side-caverns around the main cavern of Menzoberranzan .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Mantle consisted of dark tunnels that were spread throughout the Dark Dominion , and was split into sub-caverns: the Eastways , the Masterways , the Wanderways , and the Westways .</p>
<h3>The Eastways</h3>
<p>Within the Eastways were Ablonsheir's Cave , named for Ablonsheir Ulu'ar , a former archmage of Menzoberranzan, the Cavern of the Severed Tentacles , named for a failed invasion of illithids from Phanlinksal , and the Pit-Warrens , a jail for criminals and prisoners.</p>
<p>These tunnels led to Driders' Chasm , the Fardrimm and the tunnels of fallen Delzoun , which was claimed by dwarves .</p>
<h3>The Masterways</h3>
<p>These tunnels were north of the Clawrift . As they did not lead to wide areas of the Underdark, the Masterways were considered a very safe spot in the otherwise perilous area. Several drow nobles use these passages for sport hunting.</p>
<p>Within the Masterways were the Cavern of the Masters where the wizards of House Xorlarrin and House Barrison Del'Armgo performed rituals to help Lolth in her creation of the Demon Weave . The Masters of Sorcere performed arcane experiments in the Masterways. The Glowstones were also in the Masterways, which acted as a meeting area with naturally luminescent rocks.</p>
<h3>The Wanderways</h3>
<p>The Wanderways were the northeastern caverns of the Mantle. They were a winding arcane maze constructed by the archmage of Menzoberranzan.</p>
<h3>The Westways</h3>
<p>These tunnels lead to Blingdenstone , Mithral Hall , Luruar , Mantol-Derith , and Phanlinksal. The Westways were often scouted and patrolled by drow forces. In these tunnels was the Lustrum , an cavern filled with rich ore and gemstones .</p>
