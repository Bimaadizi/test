<p>Florin Falconhand ( pronounced : /ˈ f l ɔːr ɪ n / FLOR-in ) was a human ranger , a founding and senior member of the Knights of Myth Drannor , and the husband of Dove Falconhand .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Florin was a tall human male with curly hair. He had a noticeable scar on his hand. As a youth, Florin was reckless enough to try and pet a baby red dragon leashed to a traveling merchant on his way to sell the beast in Sembia . The dragon breathed fire on Florin, giving him the scar.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Florin was a direct but polite and honest person.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Florin's father was Hethcanter Falconhand , a retired human captain of the Cormyrean army, and his mother was the half-elf mage Imsra Skydusk . Through his father, Florin was the distant descendant of Endeir Falconhand who was present at the founding of Cormyr in the Year of Opening Doors, 26 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Florin looked entirely human, despite his heritage, but maintained a childhood interest in elves and nature. His mother encouraged him to garden, but his father organized him an apprenticeship with Hawkstone , an armorer in Espar. Despite this, Florin preferred nature, and earned the nickname "Silent" from his many walks in the woods. He became skilled with the longsword and two-handed sword . He also became friends with Doust Sulwood , Islif Lurelake , Jhessail Silvertree , and Semoor Wolftooth .</p>
<p>In 1348 DR, the Year of the Spur, Florin jointly established an adventuring party, the Swords of Espar, with Doust, Islif, Jhessail, and Semoor. They went on to become the Swords of Eveningstar. After many adventures in Cormyr, the expanded group then became the fabled Knights of Myth Drannor , of whom Florin was a senior member. The Knights devoted themselves to defending the ruins of Myth Drannor, largely abandoned by its elven guardians after the Elven Retreat began in 1344 DR.</p>
<p>When Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun offered Florin a position as lord of Shadowdale in 1350 DR, Florin declined and the position instead went to Doust Sulwood . Later, in 1355 DR, Florin and the Knights slew the Zhentarim agent Whisper at Whisper's Crypt . In 1357 DR, after freeing her from the clutches of the Zhentarim, Florin married Dove Falconhand . Florin then briefly met the Heroes of Waterdeep in the Burial Glen of Myth Drannor in 1358 DR; he mistook them for thugs, but heard from Elminster that a group of heroes had come to help liberate Myth Drannor and so he wished the adventurers well. The following year, in 1359 DR, Florin put the word out that he had temporarily moved back to his "ancestral manor" in Espar (actually a humble cottage) with his wife, Dove, to raise their child, Azalar , though in fact they took him to Evermeet and alternated parenting duties for a time.</p>
<p>During his adventures, Florin acquired Firefoam , a telepathic warhorse , and a hawk named Minstrel .</p>
<p>Florin’s death is not recorded, but it is known that he was dead by 1487 DR when his wife, Dove, was slain during the Shadovar Siege of Myth Drannor.</p>
