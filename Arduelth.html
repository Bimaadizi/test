<p>Arduelth , or the Lost Witch , was once a young and promising hathran who succumbed to an unknown malicious influence and madness sometime before 1374 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Arduelth was a promising young Rashemi wychlaran from the city of Mulsantir . Like every person in the country, she grew up under oppressive influence and constant danger from Rashemen's southern neighbor â€“ the land of the Red Wizards , Thay . When the time came for her dajemma , the journey of self-discovery traditional among her people, Arduelth departed home, searching and researching the most powerful magics to be used against Thay. Several years passed. She returned bearing a glowing periapt , later known as the Periapt of the Lost Witch , and a haunted look in her eyes. The young woman claimed to have uncovered the creation secret of periapts of the Lost Witch and several other powerful artifacts.</p>
<p>Arduelth persuaded hathrans with her zealous intensity, despite their doubts, that using such dire magics and artifacts against Thay would break the Red Wizard nation. Gravely, she was made a hathran. With time, the other hathrans realized their error. Arduelth succumbed to obsession, or madness, searching for darker and eviler magics. She developed more elaborate plans. They started from abolishing slavery in Thay, eventually turning into plans to enslave the Red Wizards and sap their magic to be used for the witches' empowerment.</p>
<p>Fearing Arduelth's madness and disaster it could end in, hathrans dispensed Rashemi justice. Arduelth was bound and thrown off a seaside cliff in Mulsantir. As of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the Lost Witch's skeletal remains and still glowing Periapt of the Lost Witch could be found amid rocks of the same cliff that became her grave. Those who touched the amulet felt Arduelth's determination radiating from within the glowing amulet, eager to finish the witch's plans of enslaving the Red Wizards and their nation.</p>
