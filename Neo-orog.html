<p>Neo-orogs were a race created to serve as warriors for Thay . They were hybrids of orcs and ogres , as well as of other creatures. There were two kinds: red neo-orogs and black neo-orogs .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Both types of neo-orog were tall and muscular, with tough, leathery skin. They had large, hooded eyes and bestial snouted faces. Red neo-orogs had mottled dark-red skin and yellow eyes. Black neo-orogs were leaner and slightly taller, with skin that ranged in color from dark green to sooty black, slightly less bestial facial features, and smaller, completely black eyes.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Neo-orogs were violent creatures that lived for battle, yet were also loyal to Thay.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Red neo-orogs had a unique war-cry that heartened them and all other neo-orogs, orcs, and ogres within earshot.</p>
<p>Black neo-orogs were exceptionally stealthy, such that even alert enemies had a very small chance of spotting them while they hid.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Red neo-orogs were known to fight with broad swords, warhammers, axes, maces, spears & shields, crossbows, and daggers. Black neo-orogs were known to fight with broad swords, shortbows, crossbows, longbows, spears, daggers, and shortswords.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>For many decades the Thayans tried to breed their own type of orcs that would be violent but loyal; in the neo-orogs they had largely succeeded. Bred by magic from orcs, ogres, and other creatures, the biggest drawback was their slow rate of reproduction, such that Thay could only field a few companies. Red neo-orogs were bred as elite troops, while black neo-orogs were bred as archers, scouts, and infiltrators.</p>
<p>No independent neo-orogs existed, with all of them living in barracks built and maintained by the Red Wizards.</p>
