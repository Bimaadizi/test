<p>Wall of the Faithless was a book with a self-explanatory title, being dedicated to the Wall of the Faithless in the Fugue Plane , penned sometime before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>The tome described the Fugue Plane and its barren gray wasteland of ash with the City of Judgement and its Crystal Spire rising up above the petitioners at the plane's center. The description continued on to describe the dead who worshiped the gods , who waited in the ash mud for their deities to collect them into the afterlife. However, not all dead claimed patronage of deities. Those mad mortals who spent their lives revering no deity were condemned to the Wall of the Faithless, which was created many centuries prior to the book's composition by Myrkul , the Lord of Bones. Myrkul was a deity who enjoyed his petty torments, entombing the godless souls into the Wall to deny them any form of peace in death.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, a copy of Wall of the Faithless could be found in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate 's home of Cazador Szarr , with several other copies found throughout the city.</p>
