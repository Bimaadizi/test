<p>Froghemoths were massive amphibious predators with four tentacles and three eyes. They were revered by bullywugs , who treated them as gods.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Froghemoths were some 18 ft (5.5 m) long (or tall, when standing) and 10 ft (3 m) wide, yellow on the belly and yellowish-green on the undersides of the legs, shading to light green on the sides, and then to mottled green on the 15‑foot-long (4.6‑meter) tentacles and back. The nostrils were on short stalks, and the three eyes, which were greenish-tinged amber with vertical, bright green edged with orange pupils, were similarly located on retractable appendage. Fully grown froghemoths weighed 5 tons (4,500 kg).</p>
<p>Immature froghemoths, called tadhemoths , looked fish-like, with four pectoral fins and two tails (which became tentacles and legs respectively) hatched from eggs about 1 ft (0.3 m) in diameter, and grew a foot each month for six months, and then a foot every two months until they reached full size. The tentacles started developing at the six-month mark, and the legs started developing by the tenth month. After twelve months, the creature was fully mature. Tadhemoths were fully aquatic and relied on gills to breathe.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>If a bullywug tribe came across a froghemoth, they would attempt to lure it to their den, paying tribute in the form of food and protection. They could communicate only at a basic level, so the froghemoth usually killed and ate a number of bullywugs before they could successfully communicate their intentions.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to Omuan legends, the froghemoths were a creation of the primordial Ubtao . When Papazotl the eblis discovered Ubtao had forsaken the Omuans, he sent Kubazan the toad to parlay with Ubtao on behalf of the humans . But this enraged Kubazan, and he decided to wrest with Ubtao instead. Amused, the primordial gave Kubazan tentacles to make it stronger, creating the first froghemoth.</p>
<h2>Notable froghemoths</h2>
<p>Froghemoths dwelt in a swamp outside Manshaka in Calimshan . In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , lured by the fighting between Vajra Valmeyjar and Salabak , it burst out of the water and caught Salabak with its long tongue, devouring him before retreating underwater.</p>
<p>Kubazan, one of the Nine Trickster Gods of Chult , was a froghemoth.</p>
