<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the revel at the home of Halonder Eldeglut in 1369 DR , where drow imposters disguised as other city notables drugged the host and his wife, then abducted them for replacement by imposters, Nuelvar was one of the imposters. Their plan was briefly sidetracked by the discovery one of their imposters had in turn been replaced by Qilué Veladorn , prompting a fight; the new imposter lost that fight, and was pinned helpless. After the warrior Quztyr 's mind was annihilated by his attempt to mind-ream her, the sorceress Daerdatha commanded Nuelvar to execute Quztyr, which he did.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Nuelvar was one of the seven minds that Daerdatha linked with her own to be able to withstand plumbing into the enemy infiltrator's mind. Daerdatha was able to discern their intruder was a Chosen of Mystra and one of the Seven Sisters , and made up a ruse that she may explode to let them work without most of the other drow looking on. Nuelvar was prompt to slay the interloper, but Daerdatha forbid it, citing an edict against the spilling of drow blood. Instead, they dumped her in the River Chionthar , by Khlemmer's Dock .</p>
<p>After dumping her, Nuelvar sighed with a heavy heart. Daerdatha blew up his head on the spot for that.</p>
