<p>Jandur was a War Wizard of Cormyr in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point after spring started in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , the Red Wizard Harnrim Starangh assaulted the armory of the sanctum where Vangerdahast dwelt after his retirement as Royal Mage of Cormyr . In doing so, he slew three mages: one with a slaying-snake spell, another by twisting his shielding magic against himself into a paralyzing field, and a third with staeradder poison. He fled after using a spell that burned out all recollections from their minds, preventing their dead bodies from responding to any questioning.</p>
<p>Darthym reported Jandur as dead to the War Wizard Huldyl Rauthur , a fellow War Wizard working in the sanctum.</p>
<p>In particular, Darthym noted that Throckyl had been blown apart, and his head was separated from the rest of his body. As the man bitten by a snake was not decapitated by any spells, Throckyl must've been one of the two guardians of the inner sanctum, strongly implying that Harnrim Starangh's spell to burn away memories could also cause bodily destruction in some cases.</p>
