<p>Lessons of Helm was a religious book dedicated to the deity Helm , transcribed by the eccentric paladin who named himself Thou Shalt Not Suffer the Doom Herring to Live O'Reilly sometime before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>Lessons of Helm was a hand-penned tome of dogmas and doctrines of Helm the Vigilant, transcribed, interpreted, and written down by Thou Shalt Not Suffer the Doom Herring to Live O'Reilly. The paladin's chosen name was inspired by his delusion that the infamous beholder leader of Xanathar's Thieves' Guild in reality was something called a "doom herring ." The paladin's work claimed that Helm's doctrines were not much different from those of other goodly gods, apart from Helm's focus on protecting the needy, praising of the shield and steel use, and compassion for the weak and repressed.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a copy, or possibly the original of Lessons of Helm was stored among the many religious books available to the guests of the Stormshore Tabernacle , a non-denominational shrine in Baldur's Gate .</p>
