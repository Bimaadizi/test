<p>Alu-fiends ( pronounced : /ˈ æ l uː f i n d / ÆL-oo-feend ) were the product of successful procreation between a succubus and a male mortal (usually human ). [ citation needed ] The male equivalent to an alu-fiend was generally called a cambion . Successive offspring from either (with mortals) were demonic tieflings . [ citation needed ]</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Females were, generally, attractive or beautiful, going to great lengths at times to conceal their needle-like teeth and diminutive wings. They often possessed a high degree of sexual proclivity. Males, however, were harder to distinguish, as its "cousin", the cambion (produced from a female mortal), possessed many of the same "abyssal" traits. This led to a diminishing use of the patrilineal- and matrilineal-influenced terms as a whole; rather, products of both partnerings were considered "half-fiend". [ citation needed ]</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Alu-fiends were known to serve the goddess of bad luck Beshaba , with two of the winged creatures being among the deity's closest attendants.</p>
<h2>Notable Alu-Fiends</h2>
