<p>Shinthala Deepcrest was a druid of Silvanus and member of the Elder Circle of the Emerald Enclave during the 14 th and 15 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>She was born in Cedarsproke in the Gulthmere Forest in the Year of the Watching Cold, 1320 DR .</p>
<p>In the late 1400s DR, Shinthala felt unable to act as she would've liked because of the chaos caused by the Spellplague , which had altered the natural ecosystems and driven Cindermoon , the elven member of the Elder Circle, insane .</p>
<p>Finally, in the Year of the Nether Mountain Scrolls, 1486 DR , the boy prophet of Lathander , Stedd Whitehorn , arrived and successfully cured Cindermoon. However, a large pirate fleet led by the Chosen of Umberlee , Evendur Highcastle , followed him in order to kill him. Shinthala alone agreed to join Stedd's companions and the Turmish navy in fighting them. During the battle, Shinthala and others faced Evendur and Shinthala was seriously injured. Finally, Stedd joined the fight and saved Shinthala's life.</p>
