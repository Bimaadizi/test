<p>Thrym extract was dangerous substance harvested from worms that dwelt in the arctic, such as remorhaz . The extract was most common in the north Faerûn , Icewind Dale , and Ten Towns .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Thrym was extracted and distilled from the glands of creatures like remorhaz. This substance allowed the northern worms to stay warm in harsh freezing environments. When extracted, thrym extract was a thick liquid, deadly if consumed.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Thrym extract was a dangerous substance that proved to be fatal if consumed before significant dilution. Alchemists produced safer distilled extracts that were still not safe for consumption.</p>
<p>If ingested, thrym scorched the drinker from the inside, leaving them almost certainly dead. If the creature survived the substance imbibing, they gained immunity to cold temperatures and cold damage.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Circa 1281 DR , diluted thrym extract could be purchased from Kieran Nye , the proprietor of the Whistling Gallows Inn of Lonelywood , Ten Towns . During the same period of time, a blind dwarven smith Tiernon Denthelm who resided in the remorhaz-infested cavers of Gloomfrost , extracted thrym extract for use in his craft and offered it for purchase.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1311 DR , a gnome inventor Oswald Fiddlebender used thrym extract along with other exotic items to repair his crashed flying ship in Icewind Dale .</p>
