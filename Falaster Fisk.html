<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Falaster and Sylvira Savikas of Candlekeep were good friends.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point Falaster accompanied Sylvira to recruit the learned sage Shandeir to help translate the tome of Zariel . They worked on behalf of Thavius Kreeg , who sought a solution to help Elturel and problem with the undead . While their ship was destroyed by the red dragon Hoondarrh at the isle of Mintarn , Falaster managed to survive.</p>
<p>Some time later in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Falaster was hired by the sage Sylvira again to investigate the whereabouts of Thavius Kreeg, fearing that he had been corrupted by an archdevil . Falaster correctly deduced that the cleric was shielded by the Baldurian Vanthampur family but was captured during a reconnaissance inside their estate in the Upper City .</p>
