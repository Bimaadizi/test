<p>Powder horns were a type of small portable vessel used to store and transport either gunpowder or smokepowder .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Powder horns typically took the form of a shoulder-strung horn or leather flask, typically waterproof. They could hold up to 2 pounds (0.91 kilograms) of either powder. As a firearm typically required 1 oz (28 g) gunpowder or smokepowder to be reloaded, this meant that a powder horn held enough for most firearms to take 32 shots.</p>
