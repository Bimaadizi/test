<p>Sandlings were kin to earth elementals and native to the Elemental Plane of Earth .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sandlings typically measured 10 feet (3 meters) in diameter. They were composed of silicates and resembled mounds of sand though they could change their color to blend in with their surroundings.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Sandlings were known to intensely dislike being in the presence of most forms of organic matter.</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>Their body temperatures matched that of their typical surroundings, making them invisible to any creature that saw through infravision .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>These creatures were not aggressive and would only attack if provoked or stepped upon. Given their resemblance to their surroundings, surprise was usually on their side. They were able to envelop two human -sized creatures at a time. They could strike with an abrasive appendage.</p>
<p>If 10 gallons (0.038 cubic meters) of water was poured onto a sandling it had the same effect as a slow spell.</p>
<p>Sandlings were immune to all sleep , hold , and charm spells as well as other mind-affecting attacks.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Sandlings laid claim to territories that were only recognizable to other sandlings. Aside from territorial conflicts, they had no societal interactions with others of their kind.</p>
<p>These creatures reproduced by producing buds. A territory of an adult sandling could have thousands of smaller bud sandlings in the same area, but those who did not find their own territories after reaching a diameter of 6 inches (0.15 meters) risked being consumed by the parent.</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Sandlings fed on minerals within the earth.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Sandlings were known to be found in the deserts of Maztica , the Raurin desert , and the Quoya Deserts</p>
<p>Beyond Toril , sandlings inhabited the many deserts of the planet Oerth .</p>
