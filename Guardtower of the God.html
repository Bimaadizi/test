<p>The Guardtower of the God was a temple of Helm erected in the city of Redwater during the first half of the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The temple served as a training site for acolyte members of the church of Helm .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The temple was founded by the famed Helmite priest Carath , onetime bearer of the Helm of Helm , some time after the Year of the Shattered Oak, 1313 DR . Over the years, he attracted hundreds of followers during his tenure as head priest.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Bright Blade, 1347 DR , tragedy struck Redwater when the Guardtower of the God was sacked by allied Talosian and Sharran priests. The walls of the temple were brought down and Carath was crushed beneath the debris. Amid the ruins, Carath's wife Tayana wielded powerful magic and destroyed the evil clergy in a great conflagration. She then threw herself upon the fiery rubble and succumbed to the same fate as her love.</p>
<p>In the years that followed, Helm's faithful made pilgrimages to the ruined Guardtower, some of whom sought to recover the lost Helm of Helm . The legendary relic eventually presented itself before a young faithful named Rolor , who believed himself to be the reincarnated 'Sword of Helm'.</p>
