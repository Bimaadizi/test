<p>Xixis was a doppelganger adventurer and member of the Emerald Swords company until his untimely demise in 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As a doppelganger, Xixis could near-flawlessly impersonate the form of other humanoids, and pull sensitive information from the minds of those around him with ESP .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , he and the Emerald Swords were guests at Thistleflame Keep in Suzail . They conspired to kidnap Lord Partic Thistle and hand him over to Zhentil Keep for questioning, with Xixis impersonating Lord Thistle to allow the others to escape without suspicion. He was aided in this task with a ring of form retention borrowed from the wizard Kalris , which would ensure his disguise never faltered. Xixis came to enjoy the role of Lord Thistle too much, and instead of minimizing his presence among others to avoid scrutiny, began taking full advantage of the luxuries and niceties that came with nobility. This greatly alarmed the Emerald Swords, who attempted and failed to bring Xixis back on script.</p>
<p>Fearing that Xixis had gone rogue, or was simply going to get everyone caught with his recklessness, Gandegar Armstrong had Haridyn Storm kill Xixis with a dagger of venom , forcing him to act as a dead Lord Thistle instead. The ring of form retention worked as intended, and Xixis' corpse remained in the form of Lord Thistle. Despite their best attempts at diversion, the Emerald Swords were caught and Lord Thistle rescued. For their murder and kidnapping, they risked exile or execution for their crimes.</p>
