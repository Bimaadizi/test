<p>Black Mound was an exclusive neighborhood in the city of Evernight in the Shadowfell .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The neighborhood lay in the southwestern corner of the city atop a small hill—also known as the Black Mound —that overlooked the lava that flowed into the sea. The steam that arose from the hot lava meeting the water would occasionally cause a cloud of fog and mist to settle over the area.</p>
<p>Black Mound was the site of houses and manors that were much larger than buildings in other parts of the city. While sometimes opulent, they were just as filthy and decrepit as the rest of Evernight.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Black Mound was home to some of Evernight's most powerful undead (mostly intelligent ghouls ), including its ruling Tribunal . The residents were accustomed to getting their way in disputes with inhabitants of other parts of Evernight.</p>
<p>Any lesser undead or visitors to the city were liable to be stopped for questioning if they lingered in Black Mound.</p>
