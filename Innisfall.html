<p>Innisfall was a hamlet in the vicinity of Dragonspear Castle .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Shining Crusade targeted Innisfall in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , hoping to sack the small settlement and gain supplies and recruits. However, when they arrived, the hamlet was nearly empty of both people and supplies. Innisfall had been forewarned by Corinth , a Crusade scout who had family in Innisfall, and the entire hamlet evacuated shortly before the Crusade arrived.</p>
