<p>The Troll Mountains were a range of low mountains in Amn , so named for the rather intelligent trolls that inhabited their peaks. They were considered the "gateway to the northeast".</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Troll Mountains formed part of the northern border of Amn, along with the Cloud Peaks to the west. Between the Troll Mountains and Snowflake and Giant's Run Mountains farther to the east lay great open plains.</p>
<p>The average peak height within the range was about 11,000 feet (3,400 meters) above sea level. They were less humid than the Cloud Peaks and were only covered with snow during the winter months.</p>
<p>One of the rivers composing the Esmelflow ran down from the Troll Mountains, and the Khalleshyr river began here as well.</p>
<p>The mountains were notable for their large deposits of gems , nickel, and iron.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Centuries before humans settled the lands of Amn, the Troll Mountains were home to an actual civilization of trolls. The humans eventually slaughtered the trolls nearly to extinction, but they were unsuccessful in wiping them out entirely. The majority of the trolls' treasures, including magical items, were never taken by the humans and remained deep in the mountains.</p>
<p>By 1369 DR , the Twisted Rune had placed a magical gate in the area to allow for instantaneous movement to other locations.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The trolls from the Troll Mountains have historically been a problem for Amn. In the northern reaches of the mountains, the trolls were sometimes joined by goblins and orcs .</p>
<p>The infamous red dragon Balagos also made his lair in these mountains.</p>
