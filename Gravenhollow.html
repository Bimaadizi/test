<p>Gravenhollow was a mystic library in the Underdark . It was a serene repository of knowledge set within the chaotic underworld of Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Gravenhollow's location was to the west of the Wormwrithings . It was 120 miles (190,000 meters) from Gauntlgrym and 360 miles (580,000 meters) from Mantol-Derith .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gravenhollow was carved out of a titanic geode imbued with faerzress .</p>
<p>The library was a peculiar building for many reasons: it was outside the normal time of Toril , everybody inside it understood all languages, it was bigger on the inside, it prevented works of magic except divination , and nobody could find it without its keeper's will.</p>
<p>A very peculiar trait of Gravenhollow was that it "remembered" all who had walked its halls, as well as those who would visit the library in the future. People exploring the library found apparitions constantly flicking in and out of existence around them. These were the echoes of those who had come or would come to Gravenhollow in search of knowledge.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nobody knew who built Gravenhollow, but it was known to have existed since the dawn of giant-kin .</p>
