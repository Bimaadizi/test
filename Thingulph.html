<p>The Thingulph was a part of the Guthland in southern Thindol on the Chultan Peninsula of southwest Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Thingulph was the wide "mouth" of the large bay that dominated the center of Thindol. Several towns were located along its shores.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The waters of the Thingulph were made treacherous by surging waters expelled from the vast subterranean waterway known as Labrand's Folly which was connected to the gulph.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Thingulph's shallow waters held an abundance of sea life. Yuan-ti members of House Sseradess laired beneath the waters of the western Thingulph approximately 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of Thindar within a coral fortress called Khass'insara . Kuo-toa raiders from Gathgoolgapool used the tunnels of Labrand's Folly to enter the Thingulph and attack small coastal settlements or small sailing vessels.</p>
