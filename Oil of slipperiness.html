<p>Oil of slipperiness , also known as salve of slipperiness , was a magical unguent that rendered a creature extremely difficult to restrain.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The oil was heavy, black, and sticky, but flowed surprisingly quickly out of its container. A viscous blue type of oil of slipperiness was brewed in the city of Oeble of the Border Kingdoms . That oil was a strong lubricant used to unstuck almost anything.</p>
<p>One dose of oil of slipperiness was sufficient to cover the entire body and equipment of a human -sized creature. More doses were required if intended to be applied over a larger individual. Applying the oil was a process that took 10 minutes.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>One application of the oil granted a creature the effects of a freedom of movement spell for 8 hours. Alternatively, pouring the oil on the ground covered an area equivalent to a square 10 feet (3 meters) on a side, giving it the effects of a grease spell for 8 hours.</p>
<p>An anointed creature or area could be cleaned of oil of slipperiness by wiping or rinsing with alcohol or wine .</p>
<h2>Components</h2>
<p>The primary ingredients of oil of slipperiness were either the gland from a purple worm or the liver from a giant pike.</p>
