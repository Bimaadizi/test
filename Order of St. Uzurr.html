<p>The Order of St. Uzurr was a monastic order that was devoted to Ilmater and followed Saint Uzurr . They were based at the Cloister of St. Uzurr in the city of Uzurr in Lapaliiya .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ilmatari missionaries of the Order of St. Uzurr traveled from Calimshan to Lapaliiya during the time of the Shoon Imperium ( 27 â€“ 450 DR ). There they founded a walled monastery called the Cloister of St. Uzurr . In the following centuries, a city grew up around the monastery, known simply as "Uzurr", which the Order came to dominate. Both the Order and the city were led by the Abbot of St. Uzurr. Circa 1373 DR , this was Abbot Kadar al Ilmater .</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a member of the Order was a spy working for the yuan-ti House Eselemas , who reported on Kadar's research into curing tainted ones and broodguards . In response, yuan-ti purebloods began infiltrating Uzurr on Eleasias 1 , the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , with the aim of assassinating Kadar.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Order worked to spread Ilmater's teachings across the Tashtan Coast . It cultivated, produced and exported olives, wines , and assorted spices to support itself.</p>
