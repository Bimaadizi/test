<p>Placidor was a dwarf and the hero of the Battle of Twelvesuns .</p>
<p>Descendants of Placidor could call themselves "Blood of Placidor" under the traditional dwarven naming system. However, in the midâ€“14th century DR , one such descendent declined as an act of rebellion, naming himself " Onyx the Invincible " instead.</p>
