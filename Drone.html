<p>Drone was a variety of enchanted morning stars created on the Sword Coast North in the late 14 th century DR , with the original and the most powerful variety once being wielded the deaf weapon master Vondin Clatch .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>There existed three variants of the Drone , each possessed a +1 , +4 , and +8 enchantments what made the bludgeons deadlier and guided the wielder's hand towards the target. All three versions were ensorcelled to dead sonic damage to the targets while the stronger varieties also could slow the opponents down for twelve seconds.</p>
<p>A Drone Morning Star could be created from an enchanted morningstar and a vial full of fairy dust .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first Drone was wielded by the deaf weapon master Vondin Clatch sometime before the late 15 th century DR. The master learned to use his infirmity to his advantage in battle and used Drone – a magic weapon that glowed and vibrated, dealing sonic damage to the entire area around Vondin. When his apprentice inherited the weapon, he paid a wizard to focus the weapon's destructive magics so the sonic damage only affected the target, making the weapon usable to non-deaf individuals.</p>
<p>More common versions of the Drone morningstars with a simpler +1 enchantment were forged by Master Blacksmith Marrok of Shining Knight Arms and Armor shop of Neverwinter to help the heroes who sought the cure from the dreaded Wailing Death of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Later the same year, more powerful versions were created by Master Blacksmith Barun of Beorunna's Well to help the forces of Neverwinter stand against Lady Aribeth the Betrayer , who led a marching army of Luskan in the deadly but short-lived Neverwinter-Luskan war.</p>
