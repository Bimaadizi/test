<p>Abyssal chickens were small fiends native to the Abyss .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Abyssal chickens were small creatures. They had leather wings but were not capable of sustained flight. Their wings were folded above them, giving them a tear-shaped appearance. They had a large mouth filled with fangs and a long tongue. Abyssal chickens' primary form of locomotion was their two large legs, which ended in feet resembling those of a regular chicken. Each foot had three large claws.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Abyssal chickens used their claws and fangs to defend themselves or attack prey. They were fast runners and used their wings to increase their speed.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Native to the Abyss, abyssal chickens were also found on Avernus . They were spawned fully-grown in the Spawning Trees . The trees held fleshy sacks on their branches, and when mature they fell to the ground, breaking open.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>Abyssal chickens were hunted and used as a food item. Their flesh had a taste identical to that of a fatty chicken. They were sometimes used as familiars .</p>
