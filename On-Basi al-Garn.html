<p>On-Basi al-Garn was the Chief Scribe of the Free City of Utaqa in north Zakhara in 1367Â DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>On-Basi's job was to write glowing reports about Caliph Agara al-Gandar that were sent to the courts of Huzuz and Qudra . He excelled at his job probably more than he should have, for his over-embellished reports of the Caliph's proficiency as a ruler resulted in an increase in demands from the greater cities.</p>
<p>His latest report told a false tale of the Caliph's victory over a group of yak-folk . News of this tale actually reached the ears of the wicked creatures in the World Pillar Mountains . Their response was to send several angry dao slaves to visit the Caliph in his bedroom.</p>
