<p>The Arena was a coliseum located in the city of Zhentil Keep during the midâ€“14 th century DR before that city's destruction.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Arena was located in Zhentil Keep's Inner Quarter along the Street of the Gods .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>All manners of gladiatorial games were conducted within the Arena. The structure was also used heavily by Zhentil Keep's justice system by having condemned criminals fight to the death and even during a trial of guilt where an accused faced their accuser with weapons bared. Trials of combat were held four or five times per week. There was slim hope for combatants who managed to survive their first contest as they would be summoned to fight again and again until slain. Furthermore, the living conditions for combatants within the Arena cells were deplorable and injured combatants were not given any form of healing.</p>
<p>The Arena was used as a bazaar to unload larger caravans on days where no fights were scheduled.</p>
