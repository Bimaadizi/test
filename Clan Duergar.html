<p>Clan Duergar was a shield dwarf clan of Shanatar whose members were eventually enslaved by the illithids and became the duergar , a race of gray dwarves.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Clan was one of many who splintered off to form a new kingdom in the early days of Shanatar, venerating Laduguer in a strict theocracy, naming it Barakuir . The sub-kingdom held fierce rivalries with neighbouring Drakkalor and Ultoksamrin , which became conflict from about −9000 DR in the Spawn Wars .</p>
<p>Barakuir swore allegiance to Shanatar and the Wyrmskull Throne but Clan Duergar, the ruling clan of the sub-kingdom, became more and more tyrannical, leading more and more dwarves of other clans to flee.</p>
<p>During the Mindstalker Wars around −8100 DR , Barakuir became cut off from the rest of Shanatar, and fell to its illithid conquerers, who enslaved its populace for thousands of years. Eventually, as slaves, the inhabitants transformed into a new dwarven race known as the duergar (or gray dwarves). It rose up and liberated itself around −4000 DR , spreading out into the Underdark .</p>
