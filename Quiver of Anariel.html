<p>The quiver of Anariel was a magical arrow quiver that automatically replenished its ammunition.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The quiver of Anariel looked like any other ordinary arrow quiver, holding twenty arrows. It weighed 1 pound (0.45 kilograms).</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This quiver automatically refilled itself with regular or magical arrows, ensuring that it was always full. An arrow quickly disappeared if it was not used, however.</p>
<p>A quiver of Anariel could be fashioned that produced basic arrows, masterwork arrows, or a range of magical arrows, at increasing costs:</p>
<p>They could also have heads formed from special materials for extra cost, including adamantine (+6000 gp), alchemical silver (+200 gp), or cold iron (+4005).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lady Anariel once gifted one of these quivers along with the bow Taulmaril to Clan Battlehammer at Mithril Hall .</p>
<p>In 1356 DR , the Companions of the Hall explored the ruins of Mithril Hall and Regis discovered Taulmaril and the quiver in a crack in a stone wall. They gave both quiver and bow to Catti-brie , and she went on to use both in many battles.</p>
