<p>The Temple of Bane in Bezantur was the center of Thayan worship of Bane in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple was located in eastern-central Bezantur, the so-called "City of a Thousand Temples." Appropriately, it was surrounded by other temples, namely the much larger House of Cyric (formerly a temple of Bhaal ) and the Temple of Tempus to the west, the Temple of Talos to the north, the grand Temple of Kossuth to the east, and the Temple of Tyr and Temple of Lolth to the south.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The temple was a well-maintained, jet-black building. It also contained a shrine to Talona .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The temple hosted religious services to Bane and was the headquarters of the church of Bane in Thay. It was not, however, the largest Thayan temple to Bane, which was instead located in Escalant .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to the Time of Troubles , not only did all other temples of Bane in Thay report to the high priest of the temple in Bezantur, but the the Thayan clergies of Bhaal , Iyachtu Xvim , and Loviatar did as well. The Red Wizards were wary of the temple as they suspected it was an ally of the Zhentarim .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , the high priest of the temple had begun to see the Red Wizards as blasphemers who would strive to become gods themselves rather than submit to Bane. He called upon Bane to punish these heathens, and in response, Iyachtu Xvim himself was tasked with inserting himself into the Thayan power struggles to begin smiting the Red Wizards.</p>
<p>Following Bane's death in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , the dead god 's popularity remained high enough that a small contingent of priests continued to maintain the temple and to pray for his return, even leading ceremonies in his name. Bane did indeed return to life in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , and his church regained its strength.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In the midâ€“14 th century DR, the high priest was an influential figure who was believed to be an agent of Zhentil Keep . As of the late 1360s DR, the temple was headed by a high priestess named Cothra who actually worshiped Iyachtu Xvim .</p>
