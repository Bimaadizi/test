<p>Ring of the Rogue was an enchanted ring once in possession of Tomi Undergallows that became stronger the longer it remained with its owner.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Ring of the Rogue appeared to be a plain ring. It pulsated with a faint glow and felt warm.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Ring of the Rogue was not sentient nor alive but it unlocked its true powers gradually with time. Initially, the ring gave the user a small enchantment to their dexterity, and skills of trap disarming and lock picking. After some time with its owner, the ring increased its enchantments. Eventually, at its peak, the Ring of the Rogue significantly increased the wearer's dexterity, and skills of trap disabling, lock picking, hiding, silent moving, and pick-pocketing.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1372 DR ,the ring was owned by Tomi Undergallows, a rogue companion of the Hero of Neverwinter aiding them in the quest to stop the Wailing Death epidemic and standing against the cult that was attempting to destroy Neverwinter . Tomi, with his impatient nature, could not figure out how the ring worked and ended up getting rid of it by gifting it to the Hero as a token of friendship.</p>
