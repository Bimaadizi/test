<p>Malver Tulbard was a diligent War Wizard , and a frequent annoyance to those he would investigate.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Tulbard possessed a molded, silk covered throat & chest plate, a protection would eventually prove quite useful.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As a War Wizard , Malver's duties extended to inspecting Suzailian shops, such as the one owned by the Alchemist Immaero Sraunter .</p>
<p>Malver enjoyed buttered snails served in spiced wine , like the ones offered at Glocklin's or The Bright Sammer - upscale dining clubs along the Promenade .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Fearing that this War Wizard may investigate Sraunter's shop around the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR , Manshoon decided to eliminate him while he could. Malver was eating his beloved buttered snails at Gocklin's , as he was wont to do, when the plan was brought to motion.</p>
<p>Manshoon teleported to the establishment, taking the still dining Malver by surprise and swift lightning. Malver's shields were the first to fall, with his armour taking the next brunt. Were it not for the intervention of Lord Tauntshaw , and the subsequent assistance from spellcasters and nobles nearby, Malver would certainly have perished.</p>
