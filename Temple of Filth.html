<p>The Temple of Filth was a temple in the Shadowfell city of Evernight that was dedicated to Orcus , the demon prince of undeath , and his subordinate Doresain , patron of ghouls .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple was located on the banks of the river of lava that poured through Evernight from Mount Hotenow . It sat in the same location as did the House of Knowledge in Neverwinter on the Material Plane .</p>
<p>A pall of death hung over the entire temple grounds. Even by the standards of the Shadowfell, it was a defiled place bursting with necromantic energies that sapped the strength of the living and empowered the undead. Lights were not as bright and the air was still and cold in comparison to the rest of Evernight.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The temple was ancient as of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , and by that time, it showed little evidence that it had once been a temple to both Bhaal and Myrkul . In its windows, rather than glass there was flesh that had been stretched so tightly that light could pass through it.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Bathed in the red-tinted light from the windows, the inside of the temple was dusty and adorned with holy symbols made of bone and flesh. The altar was composed of corpses on their hands and knees which had been sewn together. These corpses had to be frequently replaced as they rotted.</p>
<p>Located deep within the temple were locked doors that were trapped, cursed , and shrouded in magical darkness . Behind these doors was said to be the Pool of Daylight .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Temple of Filth was a site of worship for Evernight's undead citizens, who would gather there to consume special flesh and chant profane litanies. Whenever a ghoul captured a living humanoid within Evernight, they would usually present them to the Temple for a " funeral " in which they were buried alive (to be eaten later) in a ceremony overseen by the temple priests .</p>
<p>Some residents of Evernight would seek out the priests to settle disputes, especially if they wished to avoid the harsh judgements of the city's courthouse, the House of Screams . In exchange for presiding over such matters, the priests generally demanded that all parties involved complete a service for the Temple, such as performing labor or capturing victims.</p>
<p>The ghouls of the temple were also charged with keeping the Pool of Daylight hidden and safeguarded.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , only the oldest of Evernight's undead remembered a time when the temple had been dedicated to Bhaal and Myrkul.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, the temple was led by a high priest of Orcus known as Grand Disciple Ursuntos , who was the most politically powerful being in Evernight aside from the tribunal . He was fearfully served by several ghoul and vampire underpriests.</p>
