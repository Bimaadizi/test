<p>Dreamwraiths were creatures that constantly searched for dreaming minds, hoping to take shape within them and plague the dreamers until they died.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Dreamwraiths looked like humans who had torn away all trappings of humanity to reveal a twisted nightmare beneath. Walking, moving, and even acting like humans, their eyes however were wild and violent, with hands curled like claws and voices harsh and otherworldly.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>They spoke any language understood by their 'host.' They could infect their host either through natural bad luck as adventurers stumbled upon them, or as part of the mindspin spell, where a dreamwraith could be summoned to attack the victim of the spell .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>The dreamwraiths were subtle killers, attacking their primary victims with despair . They would often take the form of those whom the dreamer trusted or were otherwise emotionally close to and then strike at the dreamer or their allies in the dreamscape . As any harm the dreamwraiths inflicted inside the dreamscape was not real, they would attempt to make the experience as terrible and vivid for the dreamer as they could to force the dreamer into madness. As long as the dreamer believed the harm from the dreamwraith to be real, it would seem to take effect like normal injuries, and if death was the outcome of the harm dealt, the dreamer would slip into unconsciousness until the haunting by the dreamwalker ended or allies of the dreamer managed to heal them inside the dreamscape.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , a group of adventurers returned to Ravens Bluff from the Domains of Dread where they had been for five years, but unbeknownst to them they had brought back a dreamwraith that had infiltrated the mind of one of them. Several of the adventurers died, until Emeline Carpenter , a bard of Ravens Bluff and survivor of the Domains of Dread, lay dying, ravaged by the dreamwraith. She prayed to Oghma for salvation, and an animated dragon figurine led another group of adventurers into her dreamscape to save Emeline and slay the dreamwraith.</p>
