<p>The Market District of Ravens Bluff was a small ward in the center of the city full of old warehouses and converted row-houses, which during the late 1300's DR , was inhabited by a motley group of vendors, merchants and performers. It was one of two locales in the Bluff, along with Torchtown , that was legally-sanctioned for nighttime street vendors. The market had an interesting reputation among Ravenians: it was the district that never slept, a place where someone could procure all sorts of items and creatures found throughout Faer√ªn ,</p>
<p>A shopper could find all sorts of curios within the market, ranging from live beasts that could serve as a familiar to books of lurid tales published in nearby Sembia . The "skilled" people of the district offered their share of services as well. Anyone who so required could find a skilled forger to have a near-exact copy of a desired item, be it cherished family heirloom or near-priceless ceramic vase.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The markets of Ravens Bluff were a rundown collection of decaying brick structures, crammed together with vacant city homes that had been repurposed by vendors who came from a tented shanty town outside the city proper. It was the only location of the Bluff that had been vandalized by graffiti and litter; the accumulation of thick stacks of assorted flyers, notices and playbills found stuck to doors or walls was not uncommon.</p>
<p>These unpleasant sights were somewhat overshadowed by the performers that would show off for gawking Ravenians. Jugglers, acrobats and palm-readers, who may or may-not have practiced actual divination , would gather crowds in at night while their associates hawked wares from the multitude of stalls.</p>
<p>At night, the district was nearly always alight from the glow of oil and candle lamps sitting in the glass-less windows of its dilapidated buildings.</p>
