<p>Varlae was a human cleric of Bane and member a Cult of the Dragon who served as a liaison to and an agent for the dracolich Azurphax in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Varlae was a woman who stood 5 feet and 6 inches (170 centimeters).</p>
<p>In battle, she donned a full suit of magical plate mail with magical spiked gauntlets .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>She was a powerful cleric of Bane, who focused on his domains of hatred and tyranny . Varlae had access to a large arsenal of divine spells , the most powerful of which that she typically requested from her god were perhaps blade barrier and quest .</p>
<p>Varlae had quick reflexes and was also trained in the crafting of wands and alchemical items, the brewing of potions , and the scribing of scrolls .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Besides her armor and her holy symbol of Bane, Varlae owned a finely crafted crossbow and bolts , an amulet of health , several divine scrolls, a potion imbued with the fly spell, and wands that could cure serious wounds and hold a person in place .</p>
<p>Varlae resided within the lair of Azurphax, in a tiny cave room about 25 feet (7.6 meters) across at its widest. It had very little for decorations or furniture, with only a simple bed, a desk with paper and miscellaneous writing supplies, and a three-legged stool. The chamber was lit by a hooded lantern with a flame that never went out , which sat on the desk. She kept a chest with about 500 gold pieces in a secret tunnel connecting her room to that of the dragon's. It was protected by a glyph of warding .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As an agent for Azurphax, Varlae traveled into civilized regions on her behalf. She helped to defend the dragon 's lair with glyphs of warding and various alchemical traps , which she and the dragon designed.</p>
<p>When not on a mission for her dragon, Varlae enjoyed writing poetry about the greatness of Bane.</p>
<p>If the lair were ever invaded, Varlae would fight intruders from the air, after drinking her flying potion, or shoot spells at them through the safety of illusory walls . If Azurphax became injured, Varlae would tend to her wounds with her magic. If the dragon were ever to be slain, Varlae intended to return to the Cult of the Dragon to retrieve Azurphax's phylactery and bring the dracolich back.</p>
