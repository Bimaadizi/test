<p>Gendruwo were a type of memedi native to Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gendruwo were able to shape-shift at will and were able to take on many appearances. Their natural form was a humanoid with no distinguishing features.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Like all memedi, gendruwo detested all combat. However, unlike other memedi, if confronted, a gendruwo would defend itself, even wielding a weapon if one was available. They considered the use of weapons demeaning and would dispose of it as soon as possible.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>If a human saw a gendruwo, they were struck with effects similar to that of a fear spell. Gendruwo had significant resistance to magic but were vulnerable to spells that affected spirits .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Gendruwo were infamous for their pranks. They relished in annoying humans and most often pulled relatively harmless pranks. But if a gendruwo was in a bad mood, their pranks were more malicious.</p>
<p>Their most dangerous prank was kidnapping. They lured a victim with the promise of food such as kastera . The gendruwo then grabbed their target and transported them both to the edges of the Ethereal Plane . The grasp of a gendruwo was unbreakable so the victim was helpless. Upon arriving in the Ethereal Plane, the gendruwo released their victim and returned to the Prime Material Plane , leaving their victim behind, who had to find their own way back to their previous location.</p>
<p>Gendruwo were solitary creatures but sometimes worked in a group to pull off an elaborate prank.</p>
<h2>Habitat</h2>
<p>Gendruwo were native to the Ethereal Plane and were most often encountered in Kara-Tur, usually on the island of Bawa and other islands within the Island Kingdoms . They had no lair and preferred secluded locations.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Unlike other memedi, gendruwo consumed beverages and food, as well as paper and parchment .</p>
