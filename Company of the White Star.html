<p>The Company of the White Star was an adventuring company active in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was started by Araevin Teshurr to explore the ruins of ancient elven sites.</p>
<p>When its members disbanded in the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR , Araevin gave them all a star-shaped pendant that would act as a conduit in case he needed to call them together again.</p>
<p>The company was reformed in Ches of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , and consisted of Araevin; his partner, Ilsevele Miritar ; former member Grayth Holmfast ; Grayth's squire, Brant Rethalshield ; and Maresa Rost , daughter of former member Theleda .</p>
<p>After reforming, the company went searching for telkiira . Araevin had one in his possession, which he had recovered from the slain mage Philaerin in Tower Reilloch , and each telkiira 's whereabouts were pointed to by the previous one. The company located the second telkiira in an abandoned mage's tower in the Forest of Wyrms but were ambushed by the daemonfey , who had the help of various demonic creatures. In the combat that ensued, Brant was killed, but Araevin used a teleportation spell to escape with his other companions, leaving behind their horses and supplies.</p>
<p>After returning to Evermeet , the company learned of Seiveril Miritar 's plans to counter the daemonfey army marching on Evereska , and promptly returned to Faer√ªn to aid him. They participated in the resulting Battle of the Cwm on Ches 2 , and all emerged unscathed.</p>
<p>The company marched onwards using the second telkiira as a guide to the third. From Evereska they used a portal to the Moonwood where they headed northeast towards the Cold Vale , coming across the cave of Grimlight , a behir . The telkiira was located in the cave, and although the party slew Grimlight, they were soon after ambushed by the daemonfey, who took them captive.</p>
<p>The daemonfey took the company back to their leader, Sarya Dlardrageth , at her hideout at Myth Glaurach , who revealed that the first telkiira had been planted, and three were needed to find a selukiira called the Nightstar , which contained the secrets of Aryvandaar . Since the daemonfey could not find the telkiira themselves, Sarya had tricked Araevin into locating them. When Araevin refused to unlock the third telkiira , Sarya had Nurthel Floshin kill Grayth by stabbing him in the neck, which anguished Araevin, allowing Sarya to enchant him into helping.</p>
