<p>The Heartward was the central plaza of Helm's Hold as well as the city's open marketplace. It was infamous for being haunted by ghosts and apparitions that manifested themselves on nights when a waning moon was covered by clouds.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Right in the center of this marketplace was a hangman's scaffold. When apparitions appeared on haunting nights, they went their business and occasionally performing a hanging. Numerous rows of vendor's stalls extended outwards from the gallows, encircling it towards the market's edge.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Heartward was located in the middle of the city, its borders marked by a strong wall made of stone and wood.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the Asmodeus -worshiping succubus Rohini bound a monstrosity known as Hexabaal to the gallows in the Heartward, but did not fully summon it to the Prime Material Plane . Working with Councilwoman Alisara Callum , the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge bought Hexabaal to Helm's Hold, allied itself with the creature against the Ashmadai , and learned how to infiltrate the Sanatorium beneath the Cathedral of Helm .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>The Heartward earned from the shrine of Sune that was built at the edge of the marketplace. Some time in the 1480's DR , the shrine was converted into a proper temple called Heartward Hall .</p>
