<p>Jil Torbo was a member of the Absolution Council , the ruling body of the Revel's End prison and the group that oversaw the fates of the prison's inmates on behalf of the Lords' Alliance . She served as a representative of her home city of Baldur's Gate for a time during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The councilor was a wholly dour and humorless individual. She was not without compassion however, and often gave others the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Councilor Torbo absolutely hated her job. She struggled to remain her composure whenever someone aggravated her.</p>
<p>Ever the contrarian, she regularly voted to commute prisoners' sentences, often against the wishes of her fellow councilors.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 1490s DR , the Absolution Council—Jil Torbo, Voss Anderton , Kriv Norixius , and a delayed Jarnathan —met in Revel's End to consider a pardon for Edgin Darvis and Holga Kilgore for the crimes of skulduggery and grand larceny. Torbo was wearied by Edgin's many breaks and stalling while making his statement. She was right to be—ultimately, though, the Council approved their pardon, the pair escaped by fighting off the guards, grabbing Jarnathan, and jumping through the window before they could announce it.</p>
<p>Whilst traveling south back to Baldur's Gate, Jil passed through Neverwinter and stopped at the Driftwood Tavern during the city's High Sun Games . There, she happened to notice Edgin and Holga, now joined by Simon Aumar and Doric , as they rented an upstairs meeting room. Jil alerted the Neverwinter Guard , but by the time they arrived, the thieves had escaped again.</p>
<p>More than a year later, the same council met to consider Forge Fitzwilliam for pardon, but were wise to the same tricks and refused him.</p>
