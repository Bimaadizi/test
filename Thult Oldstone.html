<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Thult Oldstone was a tough warrior, highly skilled in the art of war, and healed swiftly.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thult, who operated under a pseudonym, made a name for himself leading outcast mercenary band called The Oldstones , against the drow in the 1200s and 1300s DR across the Underdark tunnels in Sembia , Dragon Reach , and the Vast . The band consisted of a number of dwarves exiled from various clans across Faer√ªn , who clawed back into the dwarvish society's good graces, defending the Stout Folk from drow attacks. Thult Oldstone's squad fought the drow with savage determination, using self-made explosives to bury their opponents alive. Thult's career as a war leader was long and fruitful until his disappearance in the Year of the Haunting, 1377 DR . Following the disappearance and his uncertain fate, The Oldstones' numbers suffered losses, and gradually, fewer and fewer recruits sought to join. The band continued strained activities but was believed to be either dead or disbanded by the end of the Year of the Dark Goddess, 1420 DR .</p>
