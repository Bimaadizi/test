<p>Thannaberry was a cordial—an alcoholic beverage made with fruit or berry juice—available in Khôltar , south Faerûn , circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This cordial used the juice from a blue berry that was similar in texture to a cherry. Then a wine with a fiery bite was added, along with a secret blend of herbs . It was sold at Munsrum's Ready Ladle located near Handrornlar (the northern gate through the walls of Khôltar) on North Way . The staff at Munsrum's testified that this cordial had beneficial medicinal uses, which justified the price of 6 gold pieces per bottle. Thannaberry tasted sweet and was dark blue in color.</p>
