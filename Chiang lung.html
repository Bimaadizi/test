<p>Chiang lungs ( pronounced : / tʃ i ɑː ŋ l ʌ ŋ / chee-ang lung ), also known as river dragons , were wingless lung dragons that inhabited bodies of water in Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Chiang lungs were physically distinguished by their enormous size, up to 158 feet (48 meters) in length. Their scales were various shades of green or blue, with a yellow underside. They had long, white horns that grew from their heads, and adults had multi-colored beards. As they were polymorphs, they were frequently seen in human form only.</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>Chiang lungs were omnivores. Their diet consisted of minerals, gems , fish, sheep , or other large mammals. Their lairs were usually frequented by lesser spirits, who acted as aides or bodyguards. At birth they could immediately breathe both water and air. Despite being wingless, they could fly thanks to magical blue pearls which were embedded in their brains.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Chiang lung would avoid combat when possible, but were savage fighters nonetheless. In melee combat they used their claws, fangs and tails which inflicted severe damage to their opponents. When in human form, a chiang lung is armed with a massive sword.</p>

They generated storm clouds at will, causing rain whenever desired. They could also lower the water level within a 1 square mile (1.6 square kilometer) radius, this range increased as they grew older. A creature in physical contact with the dragon was able to breath and move underwater with the same effects as the water breathing and freedom of movement spells.</p>

The chiang lung were the lords and guardians of lakes and rivers; every such body of water was the jurisdiction of a single chiang lung, but they rarely showed themselves to humans outside their jurisdiction.
