<p>The Oar and Wagonwheel Inn was an inn in the city of Elturel in the Western Heartlands in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<p>Poor but cheap, it was the exception to the generally quality Elturian inns, yet it was always packed with patrons. It was crowded, noisy and raucous, and a resembled a drafty barn.</p>
<p>As Lord Dhelt decreed that inns and taverns could not operate under the same roof, and inns could not serve drinks, the Oar and Wagonwheel was expressly an inn.</p>
