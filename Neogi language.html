<p>The Neogi language , which was properly called K'azz'jak'n , was the native language of the neogi , a race of instellar slave traders. Some believed it to be an extinct language, falling out of use among the neogi in favor adopting the languages of those they commonly traded with, such as Common , Undercommon , and Terran .</p>
<h2>Speakers</h2>
<p>The Neogi language was a common secondary language among aartuk , space mimics , and elves of the Elven Imperial Fleet . In terms of geographical reach, Neogi was common among inhabitants of Realmspace and in much of the Astromundi Cluster . In the Cluster this language was so widespread as to have nearly as many speakers as Common.</p>
<p>It was generally discouraged for non-native speakers to attempt saying the names of the Neogi deities , for an incorrect pronunciation was considered among neogi to be an egregious offense warranting torture and death.</p>
<h2>Phonology</h2>
<p>Sibilants were quite prominent in K'azz'jak'n, with speakers of the language producing sounds reminiscent of whirring thri-kreen or the hissing of snakes . And the way in which words were structured and ordered in the language was considered by other creatures to be complex.</p>
<p>Being the language of a sexless race, K'azz'jak'n lacked gendered words. For example, instead of "god" or "goddess" the language only had an equivalent of "deity".</p>
