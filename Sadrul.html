<p>Sadrul was a sword belonging to the elven forager Feraih . After her death, it was bequeathed upon Kiril Duskmourn in 1374Â DR . It bore a minor enchantment.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Per Essam , the sword bore a minor enchantment, and it was the sharpest in all of Al Qahera . In actual combat, Kiril Duskmourn used it to slice a foe's steel scimitar in half.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sadrul originally belonged to Feraih . After she returned from the Palace of the Purple Emperor , some curse she carried with her slew her, even though she'd done nothing other than look at it from outside; Essam gave her sword to Kiril Duskmourn , who was headed for the same palace, so that she may avenge Feraih if she came across the source of the curse.</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>Per Essam, the sword was so sharp that Feraih once used it to part a man's dignity from his self-esteem (this was a joke).</p>
