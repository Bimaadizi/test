<p>Quinn Silverfinger was the Grand Syndar in change of The Golden Lodge , a shrine to Waukeen , in the town of Lonelywood in the late 13 th and early 14 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Quinn was a pale-skinned hin man with bright red hair, wearing the golden garb of the Waukeenar .</p>
<p>In 1373 DR , Quinn was a truly ancient halfling with gray hair, thick white eyebrows, and deep wrinkles lining his face.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Perhaps the halfling's most prized possession was his enchanted sling . Quinn brought the sling with him to Icewind Dale and hid it in a secret chest within the temple's living quarters. He used enchanted +2 force bullets and wielded a powerful +4 defending morningstar .</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>Quinn did not hold speaker Baldemar Thurlow of Lonelywood in high regard, thinking him to have the political grace of a walrus .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Quinn Silverfinger hailed from the capital of Amn – Athkatla . He joined the Church of Waukeen to dedicate himself to ambition and business, gaining him some success at the famed Goldspires temple complex. As a recognition of his work, the head priest of Goldspires blessed Quinn's fancy sling . The halfling proudly carried the weapon with him wherever he went but only got to use it on three occasions. Sometime before the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , Quinn established The Golden Lodge shrine in the frontier town of Lonelywood in Icewind Dale, driven by the challenge and desire to bring commerce and prosperity into one of the most remote places in Faerûn .</p>
<p>Another notable member of the clergy under Quinn was Nolan the Healer , who served the church at The Golden Lodge until he was shipped to Targos as a "penance" for greed running too thickly in his blood. The healer took it begrudgingly and considered the Grand Syndar to be nothing but a "runt." Nolan was tasked with establishing new trade with Lonelywood and traveled to other settlements in the area, trying to convert drunks and barbarians into the Waukenaar faith. In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , Nolan of The Golden Lodge joined the Targos Guard as a healer to aid the town against the attacks of the Legion of the Chimera that plagued the region.</p>
<p>As of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Quinn Silverfinger still remained in charge of the Lodge, the oldest living non-elven resident of Lonelywood. That year, Quinn, just like the rest of the inhabitants of Lonelywood, was plagued with dreadful nightmares, secretly sent by a night hag .</p>
