<p>The Unrolling Scroll was a shrine of Oghma , located in the Upper City of Baldur's Gate . It was a popular destination for Baldurian weddings, ceremonies or other formal recitations.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The building was constructed out of white marble and featured a striking red roof with gold leaf trim. Beneath the roof was a reflecting pool set into a rather deep basin.</p>
<p>The roof itself was constructed with remarkable acoustics, ensuring that any words spoken around the reflecting pool resounded for all to hear.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>It was believed that any bard or other artist that examined their reflection within the pool, for at least half a day, would receive a vision from Oghma himself.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The shrine was established sometime before the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , and remained standing throughout the 15 th century, until at least the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR .</p>
