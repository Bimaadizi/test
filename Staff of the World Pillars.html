<p>The Staff of the World Pillars was a powerful magical staff carried by the Forgotten God .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This staff combined all of the effects of a ring of regeneration , a staff of withering , and chimes of interruption . In the hands of the Forgotten God this staff was powered by the beliefs and sacrifices of the Forgotten God's loyal yikarian followers, meaning that it could be used without expending a charge like other magical staves. The Staff of the World Pillars possessed 40 irreplaceable charges in the hands of anyone but the Forgotten God.</p>
