<p>The Heartcoil Guardians were a small army of stone golems created to protect Chauntea's Citadel and the Harvestshield Mountain area against threats from the Underdark . They were designed to only respond to orders from the wizards who created them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Guardians were created by wizards from Chauntea's Citadel to patrol the tunnels leading to the Heartcoil Deeps , an area of the Underdark directly beneath Harvestshield Mountain. They were intended to complement the Harvestshield Reapers , a cadre of flesh golems who defended the area from above-ground raiders.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, no one remained who could control the Guardians. Despite the years of fighting threats from the Underdark, and an upswing in conflict that accompanied the rise of Mrolgyet's Legion on the surface and Qholillaroon in the Deeps, the Guardians endured.</p>
