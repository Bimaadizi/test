<p>The River Athis was a river in the Raurin fed by a magical spring in Terbakar . The spring dried out with the dying curse of the pharaoh Amun-Re , depopulating Bakar .</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The River Athis was fed by a magical spring, which teleported water into its basin. As of 1356 DR , the source of the water was within the Pyramid of Amun-Re . The river followed a sinuous, northerly path, crossing through Pazar , the sacred Oasis of the White Palm , the city of Carthag (later renamed Phoenix) , and further north, where it was joined by the waters of the Me'at Halwa on its way to the lands where Martek made his kingdom.</p>
<p>Within the Pyramid of Amun-Re, the waters of the River Athis had magical healing properties.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the Pharaoh Amun-Re made his dying curse, called in the name of Osiris , his Staff of Ruling , and the Star of Mo-Pelar , caused the water to stop being teleported out of its magical spring. The river soon dried; the land came to be called the Desert of Desolation. The lack of a viable route across cut off trade from Durpar to Semphar and Mulhorand except through a long and arduous route via sea.</p>
<p>After the river Athis dried, the Sandvoyagers' Guild sprang up. Their crossing of the desert gave rise to the Sandvoyagers' Trail , a good fraction of which followed along the dry bed of the river.</p>
<p>In 1356 DR , the curse of Amun-Re was broken, and the magical spring of the River Athis began to flow again.</p>
