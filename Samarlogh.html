The Samarlogh was actually part of the larger jungle that covered much of Chult that was separated by the mountain range. A massive stone boulder could be found in the jungles of Samarlogh. It was known as the Heart of the Samarlogh by the locals. The Stone possessed magics tied to the Positive Energy plane . A chip off the Heart was turned into the enchanted weapon called Shard of the Samarlogh – the namesake of the Batiri Stone Knives tribe .</p>
