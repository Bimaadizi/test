<p>Duke Dashard Devlin , also known as Helmont the 14th , was the twenty-first duke of the Duchy of Carmathan in the Kingdom of Damara . He ruled during the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Dashard was the fourth cousin of the previous duke, Helmont the 13th . His successor as Duke of Carmathan, Theodorus , claimed to be his long-lost brother, although the legitimacy of this claim was disputed.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After Zhengyi the Witch-King seized control of Damara in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , one of his first actions was to kill the duke of Carmathan, Helmont the 13th, and all his family. Only Zhengyi's ally and puppet Dashard survived and, as planned, Zhengyi appointed him as new duke. Under his master's guidance, Dashard built an efficient propaganda network and gained the loyalty of the citizens of Carmathan.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , Dashard heard tales of the great wealth coming out of the Bloodstone Mines and desired it for himself. Profiting off the attack of Duke William Horgath of Arcata against the Barony of Bloodstone , Dashard also sent a great and efficient army against Bloodstone. However, near Valls in the Fight of Three Borders , the Bloodstone army led by Gareth Dragonsbane defeated the Carmathans after fierce fighting, and Dashard was killed by the wizard Emelyn the Gray .</p>
