<p>The Company of the Gryphon (also seen as the Company of the Griffon ) was an adventuring company active for a few hundred years and later a mercenary company active in the mid–14 th century DR . They were credited with discovering the lost dwarven city of Gauntlgrym .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early History</h3>
<p>At some point, the Company of the Gryphon killed a goblin wielding an enchanted sword named Ghaur . The company's then leader, the warrior named Flar , claimed the sword and found it was the legendary Namarra , the Sword that Never Sleeps, which the goblins of the Valley of Khedrun had looted in the plundering of Mirabar during the Goblin Wars in 753 DR .</p>
<p>Later, to pay for training in the combat arts, Flar gave Namarra to Thulmar One-Eye of Port Llast around the 1270s DR.</p>
<h3>Gauntlgrym</h3>
<p>In the mid-1300s DR, an unidentified person in Waterdeep had discovered the location of the lost dwarven city of Gauntlgrym , reputed to contain much magic and wealth. To explore it on his behalf, he hired the Company of the Gryphon, then a mercenary company numbering thirty members. On their expedition, they found a decaying entrance to the dwarf hold in a high hidden valley. However, only three members returned, having fled the company soon after..</p>
<p>These three made it back to Waterdeep early in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR . They triumphantly announced their discovery at the Copper Cup festhall , and the Company of the Gryphon were credited with discovering Gauntlgrym that year. They began spending prodigiously on new weapons and armor for another expedition. Meanwhile, several Waterdeep-based adventurers began investigating, not only the location of the entrance to Gauntlgrym but also the fates of the rest of the Company of the Gryphon and the identity of the one who'd sent them to their dooms. Answers, however, remained unknown as of Ches of that year.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, either a week or a season later, the survivors returned to Gauntlgrym to retrieve its treasures, and did not return, not that year nor the next, nor a decade since.</p>
<p>The Knights of Myth Drannor would later re-discover Gauntlgrym by 1358 DR , and survived.</p>
