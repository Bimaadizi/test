<p>Suha was a noble dao and slave of the Unspeakable in Huzuz , the City of Delights, in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Suha remained at the Unspeakable's side at all times under a guise of invisibility while the yikarian was in control of Mu'izzi al-Kamar 's body. Like all dao enslaved to a yikarian, Suha despised her master and was constantly looking for ways to betray his presence to the natives of Huzuz. Since she could not directly betray the Unspeakable, she would often whisper cryptic hints into guests ear's when her master hosted a large party.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Under direct orders from the Unspeakable, Suha hid special magical amulets within the masonry of each room of the Royal Harim of Huzuz . These amulets made it impossible for any female within the room to conceive a male child.</p>
