<h2>History</h2>
<p>After arresting Daryth in 1345 DR , Erian entered the Festival of the Spring Equinox to drink Callidyrr mead at the tent of Geoffrey and met the lovely Meridith . Later that evening, Erian laid down with Meridith, who was actually the Darkwalker Kazgoroth in disguise, and as their lips touched, the monster stole Erian's life energy and replaced it with an evil presence. He then became Kazgoroth's unwitting servant.</p>
<p>Under the next full moon , Erian involuntarily transformed into a lycanthrope and butchered a family of halflings in Lowhill . He awoke the following morning in Corlyth Creek with no memories of the incident but covered in blood and muck.</p>
