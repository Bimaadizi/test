<p>Samurai were professional warriors of the noble class who adhered to the code of bushido . In Shou Lung , the equivalent warriors were simply called "knights".</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Samurai were fierce warriors bound by a strict code of honor, and service to their daimyo. They did not fear death, as samurai saw death to be the ultimate honor and service to their daimyo. A samurai's life was consumed by striving to achieve perfection, as it was a reflection of their honor.</p>
<p>Most samurai were human or spirit folk . Some korobokuru have successfully trained to become samurai. Both females and males could become samurai.</p>
<p>The samurai's weapon of choice was the katana . Samurai formed a deep bond with their katana, who saw it as an extension of their honor and the honor of their clan or family. The katana was often a family heirloom, passed down through the generations. It was a serious insult to just touch the scabbard of a samurai's katana without their explicit permission, drawing the blade even more so. A samurai who lost their katana was disgraced and shamed, and became obsessed with recovering the weapon, if possible.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Samurai were part of their daimyo's household. The first part of samurai training was learning to connect and focus their ki .</p>
<p>A samurai who was advanced in skill and also served their daimyo well were offered the position of jito. As jito, the samurai was given responsibility over a part of their daimyo's territory. A jito protected their daimyo's property, settled disputes among the civilians, suppressed rebellion and collected taxes on behalf of their daimyo, keeping one-quarter of the taxes for themselves. A jito had command over four samurai and up to ten bushi .</p>
<p>A jito who served well was offered the position of shugo. A shugo was in charge of an entire province, administering justice, providing protection and supervising the jito within the province.</p>
<p>A ronin was a master-less samurai. A ronin could be a samurai who has dishonored them-self, failed their daimyo, or voluntarily left the service of their daimyo.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Samurai were highly skilled martial warriors. They were experts at both archery and swordsmanship. Their weapons of choice in melee combat were the katana and wakizashi , and they chose the daikyu for ranged combat. Some samurai, particularly female samurai, favored the naginata . A samurai was also an expert horse-rider.</p>
<p>In addition to their martial prowess, samurai were skilled artists. Calligraphy, music, poetry and painting were among the most common art forms that samurai were known to be accomplished in.</p>
<p>Samurai eventually became immune to fear and advanced samurai were capable of naturally projecting an aura of fear . The strongest samurai were able to project ki into their voice, creating a deafening and powerful shout which stunned a target.</p>
