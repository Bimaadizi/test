<p>The Preyhunter was a unique heavy crossbow – the favorite weapons of Inshula sar Mashewe , a mercenary hunter from the nation of Tashalar , active in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The crossbow was a powerful but slow weapon. Despite its speed, each bolt unleashed packed enough force to pierce heavy armor as easily as beast hide. Unlike many other crossbows, Inshula's Preyhunter dealt significantly more piercing damage, and the force of impact dealt additional bludgeoning harm. The weapon's +1 enchantment made what crossbow impossible to handle by anyone who was not a human ranger .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the Preyhunter accompanied Inshula on her travels from Tashluta to the jungles of Samarach and working with the Sword Coast adventurers for the merchant Sa'Sani of Samargol .</p>
