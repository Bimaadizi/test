<p>Thorn Island was located in the Moonsea , south of the civilized portion of the city of Phlan out in the Bay of Phlan .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The island was shaped like a tear with Sokol Keep sitting on the western portion. It was said by many Phlanites the island was practically invisible in the pitch blackness of night. A ring of rocks protected the island where many ships had broken apart on in the past. However, rowboats could navigate through the rocky coast to reach the sandy shore as long as the sailors were patient.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Sokol Keep covered most of the island and could be seen from the docks. The shoreline had a low slate sheer cliff that supported the keep above.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1340 DR , Ren o' the Blade , Shal Bal of Cormyr , and Tarl Desanea traveled to the island to seek the evil within Sokol Keep.</p>
<p>In 1480 DR , Thorn Island and Sokol Keep were under the authority of House Sokol .</p>
