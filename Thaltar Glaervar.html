<p>Thaltar Glaervar was a Red Wizard of Thay in the mid-14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>He was shorter but heavier than Alustriel Silverhand .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Thaltar hedged much, and minded not to appear more confident than he was.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He knew at least one spell that created a blazing light so bright it could distract even a Chosen of Mystra , akin to pyrotechnics . Another of his spells created a deadly black flame, which nullified some spells. He also knew the manyjaws spell, though he changed it to use serpents; another of his spells created a silvery sword whose strike left a persistent spell-dampening field, making it a challenge to cast any spells. Another spell called a lash to his hand, and he could also cast a spell to animate ropes . He knew a form of telekinesis levitation , dancing lights and meteor swarm , which was his most powerful spell. He had some manner of sigil sewn into his clothes, which allowed him to unleash six different spells by merely speaking aloud certain words for each. Finally, he could use some magic to fetch objects in the vicinity, and he had at least one spell that sprayed acid over time, likely acid rain .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>His robes had his name written on them. He wore leather boots to meetings, and had an enchanted ring that could unleash a wall of force . Another ring allowed him to unleash a teleporting spell.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was part of a strange cycle-teleporting effect that allowed him to trade locations with the Waterdhavian merchant Auvrarn Labraster , but in return, he was bound to do the same whenever called on by the fellow Red Wizard Roeblen , with little warning time. This cycle had been forced upon him as part of his participation in an extensive cabal; linked into the same cycle were the Red Wizard Azmyrandyr and an especially large umber hulk . The red wizards were of Auvrarn Labraster's rank or higher. The cabal to which the Red Wizards belonged also boasted among its ranks the red wizards Skloon , Harkon , two Sharran priests, Speaker Amalrae , and a number of other Red Wizards.</p>
<p>He spent time together with a different cabal with the Red Wizards Iyrtaryld , Olorus , Dlamaerztus , Norlarram , Quaerlesz , and six others.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point, Thaltar Glaervar joined a cabal that, under direction from Halaster Blackcloak, took charge of numerous intrigues throughout Faerûn . One of the things that this cabal did was put him in a form of cycling teleportation together with two other Red Wizards, a Waterdhavian merchant, and one very big umber hulk.</p>
<p>In 1369 DR , Thaltar answered a call from Roeblen, who employed the teleporting link to swap himself out of a fight against Alustriel Silverhand and thus escape from Silverymoon , where he'd been summoned by a chain of linked teleports leading to Auvrarn Labraster, whom Alustriel believed to be hiding information regarding a murder. He left almost as soon as he arrived, barely casting a spell to dazzle the High Lady with bright light before executing his getaway, struck with a faceful of silver fire in return.</p>
<p>Later that year, while participating in a moot with other Red Wizards to discuss Iyrtaryld 's newest development on the Hungry Mouth , they were assaulted by some manner of stone creature that slew most of them. Thaltar managed to escape, and came across a second Quaerlesz, who turned out to be the Simbul after he struck it with a black flame spell. He struck at her again and again, finishing her off with a meteor swarm that slew two apprentices, leaving only charred bones and a wand. He seized the wand and dissolved the bones in acid.</p>
<p>At his next meeting with the co-conspirators under Halaster Blackcloak, he learned of the deaeths of Roeblen and Azmyrandyr. Then he revealed his slaying of the Simbul, claiming it meant they were going to be attacked by the other five surviving Seven Sisters next; however, the wand revealed itself to be the Simbul, who unleashed some manner of spell-reflecting sphere on the room. The trapped conspirators used a veritable cornucopia of spells on the sphere trapping them; one of them, a ray of cutting force, took Thaltar in the chest, slaying him.</p>
