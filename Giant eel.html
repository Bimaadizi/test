<p>Giant eels were a monstrous version of the commonly encountered eel , often resembling morays .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like most other types of eels they were long snake-like fish, often around 20 ft (6.1 m) long when adult.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Giant eels were more ill-tempered than other types of eels.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Lacking the electric ability of the electric eels and great marine eels, giant eels would instead bite with their pointy teeth, striking with incredible speed.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Habitat</h3>
<p>While they predominantly lived in saltwater, around 1-in-10 giant eels were at home in freshwater instead. Fresh water giant eels were found in the Stump Bog near the Dessarin river .</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>The skin of giant eels were used to bind certain books, the binding being smooth, glossy, and black with time. Locathah would ride atop giant eels wielding light lances in combat. Some also used giant eels for towing ships through water in the Sea of Fallen Stars , where the giant eels could tow up to 5 tons (4,500 kg) each, thus often requiring multiple giant eels working together to tow the ships.</p>
<h3>Summoning</h3>
<p>A giant eel could be summoned in freshwater environments with the Summon monster V Spell .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Giant eels fought as part of Iakhovas forces assaulting Voalidru in Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR during the Twelfth Serôs War .</p>
