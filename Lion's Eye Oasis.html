<p>A rocky outcropping on the eastern stretch reached an apex that was referred to as the actual "Lion's Eye". As the winds whipped over the plains they passed through a hole in this rock formation creating a moaning sound that permeated the landscape.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>The sand dunes that comprised the western area of the oasis were dotted with mesquite trees that led into a southern stretch of acacia and palm trees.</p>

<p>It was said that the lake in the center of the oasis held submerged treasure chests that were filled with an abundance of gold and glimmering gems . Further rumors spoke of magical items belonging to ancient civilizations that were protected by some form of underwater monstrosities.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Unlike many oases found in Anauroch, the Lion's Eye was not home to the Bedine people, but rather a community of lamias . They grazed upon their verdant stretch of the desert, hunting any intruders that dare pass over their land.</p>
