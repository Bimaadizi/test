<p>Ekawashi was a village located in Miyama Province in Kozakura .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ekawashi Village was a tranquil peasant community comprising ninety-three buildings that was controlled by the Niwa clan . Despite being the largest settlement in the shoen , it maintained a low-key character.</p>
<p>The unassuming nature of the village was partly due to the decision of the shoen's jito to establish his base in Kuda , a nearby location, rather than in Ekawashi itself. This choice by the jito resulted in minimal disturbance to the daily lives of the villagers by powerful samurai lords.</p>
<p>The absence of high-ranking samurai and the relative peace it brought inadvertently made Ekawashi an attractive haven for a particular type of visitor. Disreputable travelers and noblemen seeking anonymity found the village appealing thanks to its low profile and the reduced likelihood of encountering trouble. This characteristic made Ekawashi a discreet and favored stopover for those who wished to travel incognito or avoid the scrutiny often found in more prominent or heavily patrolled areas.</p>
