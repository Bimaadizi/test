<p>Philyra was a druid and a ranking member of the Society of Stalwart Adventurers from Suzail , active in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Philyra was an accomplished adventurer who disliked visiting Suzail and civilization in general. Within the Society of Stalwart Adventurers club, she was given an entire room, adjacent to the grand dining hall. Philyra filled the room with a cornucopia of exotic plants, thick enough to hide any signs of civilization from sight. The room was her hideaway when she ventured into the city. The plant room had a narrow path among tangled vines and was a common hiding spot of the club president 's pet leopard .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point in 1368 DR , Philyra defeated a powerful yeti during one of her expeditions and gifted the beast's body to the Stalwarts club to be preserved and displayed among many heroic accomplishments.</p>
