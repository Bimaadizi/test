<p>The grove of renewal was a mysterious druid grove that housed the Nature Seers , four ancient and extremely powerful half- elementals that judged those who came to their domain.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It was located deep beneath the surface of Toril in the molten layer of fiery rock and poisonous gas. There were rumors that spread across Faerûn regarding the grove and the powerful magic that emanated therefrom. These rumors ranged from a supposed curse set upon the grove by Silvanus to speculation that the druids had been turned to stone by a basilisk , who somehow, made it into their realm.</p>
<p>Travelers in Faerûn could travel to the grove by means of the crossroads in the Cantlowe Library Archives or by traveling through hazardous terrain beneath Toril.</p>
<h2>Purging</h2>
<p>When people traveled to the grove seeking atonement, power or knowledge they were faced by a gauntlet of trials as well as the judgement of the Seers known as the Purging . By means of traveling to a series of remote locations across Toril, they faced challenges presented by the four elemental members of the druidic circle, in an endeavor to remove imbalance from within their soul. While they were given no guarantee they would not slip into old habits, travelers to the grove remembered their entire experience and were given at least an opportunity for change.</p>
