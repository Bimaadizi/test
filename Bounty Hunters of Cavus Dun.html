<p>The Bounty Hunters of Cavus Dun , often known as the Bounty Hirelings of Cavus Dun or simply as Cavus Dun , were renowned mercenaries from Netheril in the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Members of the mercenary group were not considered Netherese nobles, but were considered above commoners.</p>
<p>The leader of Cavus Dun was called the Grandfather.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Reborn Hero, 1463 DR , a group of Cavus Dun members were hired by Effron to capture Dahlia Sin'felle and kill Drizzt Do'Urden . Following the failure of that group, a larger force, led by Glorfathel, was sent to aid Herzgo Alegni in Neverwinter and to retrieve Charon's Claw in Gauntlgrym . They failed in their task, in no small part because Ambergris turned on the group and defected to Drizzt's side, taking Afafrenfere with her.</p>
