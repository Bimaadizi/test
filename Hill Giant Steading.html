<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Hill Giant Steading fort was used as a recruitment camp for those following the evil deity Bane , or another powerful being using his name in the 14 th century DR. The Banites accumulated mercenary forces of humans, demihumans, and giants of the Moonsea. The efforts were helmed by a hill giant shaman devotee of the Lord of Tyranny. Despite the shaman's best efforts, such a collection of unruly creatures resulted in many brawls and conflicts. The infamous Fire Knives established a cell within the fort and were recruited by the leader of Steading's fire gaints to assassinate the shaman leader of the hill giants in order to take control of Bane's army.</p>
<p>After the cities of the Moonsea were transported away from Tori by a band of powerful beings, the heroes of Phlan infiltrated the Steading in order to shake and cripple Bane's hold on the region. They encountered a spy named Kardal in the fortress who informed the adventurers that in order to get close to the army's leader, the hill giant shaman, they had to assassinate a band of antagonizing cloud giants who were among many factions battling for power within the Steading.</p>
