<p>Tanglefoot bags were a means of throwing an alchemical goo to entangle an enemy.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A tanglefoot bag was usually round and made of leather and weighed about 4 pounds (1.8 kilograms). It was designed in such a way as to open up when thrown to disperse the thick goo inside. The goo hardened rapidly when it came into contact with air, so if it splashed over a creature, it could effectively glue that being to the ground.</p>
<p>A standard tanglefoot bag contained enough alchemical goo to cover a large creature. If thrown upon a flying creature, it would harden around wings and prevent flight. The goo would not harden underwater; it required contact with air.</p>
<p>The hardened goo quickly became brittle after as little as a dozen seconds or so and cracked apart. Universal solvent quickly dissolved it.</p>
<h2>Crafting</h2>
<p>Skill in alchemy was required to make a tanglefoot bag.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Tanglefoot bags were typically sold in alchemists' shops for around 50 gold pieces .</p>
