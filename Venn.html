<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Venn was a half-elf whose face was permanently colored with a knowing smirk, as if he was the only one in on a joke. He wore a wide-brimmed hat and well-worn bright red clothes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 1374 DR , Venn, a lute -payer, was a part of a roguish band of traveling performers that included Lila , a flautist ; William , a tambourinist ; and the troupe's leader, a flaming dancer named Azahr . Venn and the band spent some time performing at the Crossroad Keep as it was being reinvigorated by trade and commerce after a devastating Shadow War . The band's leader was happy to be making coin once again and planned on staying at the keep for a little while. However, that time was cut short after Azahr sole a precious artifact—the Gauntlets of Ironfist —from the keep's seneschal. Venn accompanied his bandmates to Azahr's cabin hideout in the Neverwinter Wood . Khelgar Ironfist sent a group of adventurers to retrieve the precious stolen magic item; a brawl over it was guaranteed.</p>
