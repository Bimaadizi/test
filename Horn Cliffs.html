<p>The Horn Cliffs were coastal cliffs of County Firedrake , on the northernmost tip of the Dragon's Head Peninsula , named after their position as the "horns" of the dragon head-shaped peninsula in Tethyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Horn Cliffs could be found to the east of the city of Velen , past ducal castle Tordraken . Pearl oyster -rich Acoval's Cove was located on the western side of the "horn." These thin and tall coastal cliffs stretched over four miles and resembled horns of a fierce beast protruding and stretching up from the land's edge.</p>
<p>The cliffs were a perfect seabird habitat but not much else. There were no settlements along the Horn Cliffs due to their height, yet the bluff hid numerous caves that attracted bandits, people, down on their luck, curious adventurers, and an occasional ambitious merchant in search of some hidden treasure. These visitors attracted monsters who happily fed on unwitting would-be adventurers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The origin of the Horn Cliffs remained a mystery to sages. During the period of time from around 1350 DR to 1370 DR , those show delved into the cliffs' caverns and emerged with treasures on at least two occasions. One of the recovered treasures were the the Purple Keys spellbooks that once belonged to Waterdhavian Magist Guildmaster , the other were Seven Dancers â€“ golden Sunite statues.</p>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR , Velen stationed ballistae and catapult batteries along the Horn Cliffs. Other neighboring areas that held Velen's defenses included the Blackthorn Manor , Tordraken, and the city proper. Velen's fortifications on the Horn Cliffs were placed in the area called the Prow and were guarded by a garrison.</p>
