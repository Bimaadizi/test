<p>Torrin Ironstar , or Daffyd Raltin , was a human adventurer and a member of the Order of Delvers from Eartheart .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early Life</h3>
<p>Torrin was born Daffyd Raltin to human shopkeepers in the town of Hammergate just outside Eartheart. As a young boy, Torrin helped around his parents' shop. When Torrin was seven, the shop was robbed and Torrin picked up a magical dwarven mace , activated the magic and killed the robber, something that only a dwarf was supposedly able to do. Even though his father consulted a loremaster who claimed that non-dwarves could use magical dwarven weapons, Torrin's use of the mace lead to his lifelong belief that he was really a reincarnated dwarf of the extinct Ironstar clan. At some point, Torrin left his parents and moved into Eartheart proper where he was adopted by the Thunsonn clan.</p>
<h3>Stoneplague</h3>
<p>In the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR , Torrin traveled into the Underdark to purchase a teleportation rune from a shady dwarf. The dwarf had a strange condition that made his skin look like dried mud and his eyes like white marbles.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, his young nephew Kier stole a griffon from Eartheart's griffon pens and rode to an earthmote drifting over the East Rift . Torrin followed Kier and together they found a cache of gold bars in a cave. Although they were unable to loot the cache, the city guard retrieved the stash. The bars were contaminated with the Stoneplague , which was unleashed on Eartheart.</p>
<p>Torrin deduced that the contaminated gold was the source of the Stoneplague. He used his teleportation rune to teleport to Eralynn Thunsonn in the dwarven city of Sundasz . While in Sundasz, Torrin was able to trick several of the dwarves who made the tainted gold bars into meeting him. After a fight, he interrogated one of the dwarves and learned the gold came from Moradin's River of Gold , which had been cursed by the duergar of Drik Hargunen through the use of rune magic . Torrin reported this information to the Council of Eartheart but they declined to allow him to go along on the raid to destroy the duergar magic.</p>
<p>Instead, Torrin teleported into Drik Hargunen and discovered the rune magic inside a giant geode . Torrin was able to destroy the magic with the help of several raiders from Eartheart. Torrin, however, was killed by the destruction of the rune magic.</p>
<p>After his death, his soul journeyed to Moradin 's realm and the god allowed Torrin to be reincarnated as a dwarf in honor of his service to the dwarven people. Decades later, Torrin was reincarnated as Kier's son.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Although Torrin was undeniably reincarnated by Moradin as a dwarf decades after his death, it was unknown whether his belief that he had a dwarven soul in his human body was correct.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Torin was a close friend of Eralynn Thunsonn and several other members of the Thunsonn clan. He was considered an uncle to Kier Thunsonn. He had a frosty relationship with his human parents and rarely visited them.</p>
<h2>Equipment</h2>
<p>Torrin carried a magical dwarven mace and used goggles that allowed him to see in the dark. He also carried the standard issue Delvers' magic backpack, which only he could open.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Torrin had a full red beard with silver hammers tied to the braids.</p>
