<p>Trout , commonly referred to as burslake or slake , was a common variety of fish in the continent of Faer√ªn .</p>
<h2>Species</h2>
<h3>Szorp</h3>
<p>Szorp were a troutlike fish found in the Delimbiyr . Usually brown in color, their white flesh was very tasty and was a staple food in Loudwater as well as a favored delicacy in the more opulent taverns of Waterdeep .</p>
<h3>Knucklehead</h3>
<p>The knucklehead trout was a fish unique to Icewind Dale 's three lakes: Lac Dinneshere , Maer Dualdon , and Redwaters . Most notably, as their names suggested, they had heads the size of a fist, as well as spiny bones in the rest of the body. The bone was likened to ivory in coloration and general appearance. The knucklehead itself was seen as silvery or reddish and silver in hue.</p>
<p>Scrimshaw art carved from the head bones of the knucklehead was a primary product of the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale. In fact, discovery of knucklehead bone and the art of scrimshaw led to the foundation of the Ten Towns, as it brought traders to the region. The trade made living in the cold northern land financially viable. Fishermen bringing back a good catch of knucklehead for food and scrimshaw was a highlight of daily life in the dale and skilled scrimshanders were well-respected and influential.</p>
