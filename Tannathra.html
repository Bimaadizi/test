<p>Tannathra of Hardcastle a mage of the mid-to-late 15 th century DR and the first Magister after the Spellplague .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Due to the magic items in her body, she was misshapen, and carried herself cowled and cloaked.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Tannathra had learned to control the powers of the items that had grafted themselves to her body, and found the power to regenerate in the process. She also knew a unique spell granted to her by Azuth that provided for some form of spell reflection, which affected even area spells. She was an effective combatant who prevailed even against stronger foes.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She had an abusive father, with whom she cut ties, abandoning her last name after running away.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>She possessed a belt of power , a crown of stars , and a blast scepter , all of which were grafted into her body by a surge of wild magic .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Darkenbeasts Risen, 1442 DR , Azuth offered the office of Magister to a mage in Elbulder , in the inn where Tannathra was staying, Harrion's Hall . Five other mages, taking offense, attacked him. In the ensuing spellbattle, Tannathra slew them all whilst protecting the inn. Thereafter, she faced few challengers as a Magister.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Star Walker's Return, 1490 DR , she met with Mystra , and requested to be relieved of the office. Mystra granted that, allowing her to remain as a servitor.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>After leaving the office, Tannathra had become a servitor of Mystra, who acted alone. She steered clear of politics in that role.</p>
