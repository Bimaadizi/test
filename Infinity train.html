<p>The infinity train was a dangerous magical weapon powered by soul larvae and created by Yrkhetep to defeat Anthraxus .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The infinity train was made from five levitating carts, crammed full of modified soul larvae . The larvae appeared as spirits, and were constantly producing the sounds of ghostly wailing. The carts shone brightly, were intangible, and moved at an unlimited speed.</p>
<p>The infinity train ran on a track made of an undulating glowing white tube 1 foot (0.3 meters) in diameter. Part of the track ran along the ground, and parts were raised off the ground, reaching as high as 100 feet (30 meters). The track began and ended in conduit-type portals that connected to other parts of the lower planes . These portals appeared to be filled with thick fog and drew objects and creatures within 5 feet (1.5 meters) into them.</p>
<p>It was powered by soul larvae that were stored in a nearby cylindrical tank, measuring 900 feet (270 meters) tall and just under 300 feet (91 meters) in diameter. This immense component was made from iron and had no distinguishing characteristics. It was positioned by a pool of lava.</p>
<p>The infinity train was resistant to all magic and evaded all physical attacks. The track, however, was vulnerable and able to be cut. If the Train ran into two parts of destroyed track, it would derail and instantly be destroyed.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The infinity train was a powerful weapon that fired bursts of bright white specks of energy.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The arcanaloth Yrkhetep planned to usurp his ruler the oinoloth Anthraxus. To this end, Yrkhetep created the Infinity Train to lead an army and attack Khin-Oin , where Anthraxus resided. He secretly caused wars in the Vilhon Reach to collect evil souls that powered his Train . As part of these wars, he schemed to obtain the Hand of Tyr and use it as a power source for the Infinity Train . Yrkhetep kept the infinity train a secret, as it was to be his secret weapon against Anthraxus.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while the infinity train was not yet completed, Anthraxus became aware of Yrkhetep's schemes and sought to observe the weapon himself. He inserted visions into the mind of Inata Eller , manipulating her into gathering armies together and attacking Yrkhetep for him. Following Inata's visions, a council was formed: representatives from Timindar , Ormath , Gildenglade , and Hlath . The mayor of Amah , Pachipol , summoned adventurers and the Iron Legion to the woods south of Arrabar .</p>
<p>Inata led this heroic force through a portal into Oinos , where they attempted to destroy the still unfinished Train in an battle against Yrkhetep, and his army of 100 lava mephits , skeletons , zombies , hordlings and diakka . During the battle for the infinity train , Yrkhetep was also served by Multon Weny , Drado Weny and the Master of the Realm , a quasit . The battle was watched by Anthraxus and three ultroloths , who planned to destroy the infinity train 's storage tank if the Iron Legion overwhelmed Yrkhetep.</p>
<p>Before the battle, Yrkhetep's plans involved building more storage tanks, filled with millions of soul larvae, to increase the power of the Train .</p>
