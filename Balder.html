<p>Balder ( pronounced : /ˈ b ɑː l d ɛ r / BALD-er ), sometimes spelled Baldur or Baldr , was an interloper god of beauty and charisma from the multi-spheric Norse pantheon and who was believed by some to be a dead power .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Balder was renowned for his otherworldly beauty, with the other Norse powers believing it rivaled that of all the other known deities of beauty, even that of the goddess Sune , though it wasn't certain how honest this opinion was. Fittingly, the avatars of Balder took the form of handsome fighters , often accompanied by an entourage of one or more hundred women.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Balder was said by some to have wisdom that matched his beauty, that he would never fail to fulfill obligations from his pantheon, and that he seemed to never have ulterior motives. He was incredibly charming, endearing himself to the majority of deities that met him. Sources differed as to whether the god was or wasn't vain, with some noting that he practiced very exacting standards when it came to who among the petitioners he allowed to reside within his divine hall.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Balder was a warrior of considerable skill and as a deity possessed a wide array of abilities. These included various divine immunities, being able to plane shift and teleport without error at will, he had dreams that were prophetic to some degree, and an unnatural beauty that could make mortal women "enchanted" by him. Sometimes, those who fell victim to this enchantment became slavishly devoted followers of him, abandoning their homes and families so they could follow his avatars wherever they went. The most famous of Balder's abilities was his near-invulnerability. Only weapons that had mistletoe within them could do any harm to his body.</p>
<p>His senses of hearing, sight, smell, and touch extended out as far as 14 miles (23,000 meters). Like other deities he could perceive anything occurring within 15 mi (24,000 m) of his worshipers, objects and sites sacred to him, or any location where his name or one of his many titles had been spoken within the prior hour. He could divide his senses between up to ten such places at a time. And being a god of beauty, he could also sense anything involving objects of beauty and discussions about beauty or comparing the beauty of things, the instant it occurred and could retain that information for up fourteen weeks.</p>
<p>Balder was also skilled in appraisal and crafting. He could create magical instruments and magical versions of the tools and supplies used by artists. The market value of such items never exceeded 200,000 gold pieces .</p>
<p>Balder had a wide variety of spell-like abilities that his avatar form could cast, derived from his divine domains . These included the following:</p>
<p>His avatars also had access to a wide variety of bardic spells. These included the following:</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The avatars of Balder carried some sort of sword , typically a +5 greatsword that carried the weapon qualities bane (against evil outsiders ), holy , and keen .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Balder was born to the Norse gods Frigga and Odin , alongside a blind twin brother that was named Hod . He led a relatively idyllic young life, being dotted upon by his parents, until one night he started being plagued by ominous dreams of his death yet to come and confided in those dreams to his mother. Frigga, who normally tried to not intervene in the future, either of her own volition or at the urgings of the rest of her concerned pantheon, went out and beseeched all things in creation, both animate and inanimate, to pledge that they would never harm him. Frigga was rather successful in this undertaking, though overlooked the plant known as mistletoe, believing it was far too weak to ever pose a threat to Balder. From then on Balder's body was impervious to harm and the Norse gods greatly delighted in his newfound power, often hosting contests where they would try bouncing weapons off his chest to amuse themselves, such as axes or spears .</p>
<p>Eventually he married a goddess by the name of Nanna and with her produced a son that they named Forseti.</p>
<p>To Balder's misfortune, there was one among the Norse gods who did not delight in him, but rather sought to take his life as his envy towards him and the attention he got from all the other gods grew into a sense of hatred – Loki . He one day discovered Balder's weakness by approaching Frigga in a disguise and asking her about the oath that granted Balder his invulnerability. He then planned to one day kill him with a spear fashioned from mistletoe and to trick his twin brother, Hod the Blind, into carrying out the act. However, the Norns foresaw Hod's murder of Balder and informed the other gods, who proceeded to banish Hod from Asgard to ensure that future would never come to pass. Undeterred by this, Loki continued plotting Balder's death, still focused on the idea of a spear of mistletoe.</p>
<p>According to some sources, Balder's prophesied death could not be prevented, as Loki ultimately managed to achieve his goals by having Hod the Blind throw a different weapon made out of mistletoe. Depending upon the source, this weapon was either a sharpened dart or a wand , and Loki had guided Hod's hands so that it would land squarely in Balder's heart.</p>
<p>Some centuries prior to the Time of Troubles , in the kingdom of Bakar , a survivor state of the Imaskar Empire , a mighty city known as Medinat Muskawoon housed temples to gods of faiths that the populace's ancestors brought over from their original worlds. Among these temples was one dedicated to Balder, known simply as the Temple of Balder , though those who worshiped him in the city believed Balder to possibly be dead, slain by a wand of mistletoe. In front of his temple stood a semi-circle of stones, a shrine dedicated to the Norns. It was magically warded to keep out all wooden objects, especially mistletoe, and was meant to act as protection for Balder against fate and all who would seek to do him harm.</p>
<p>When a group of adventurers explored the ruins of Medinat Muskawoon in the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR , the Norns appeared before them at their shrine and asked the adventurers a set of three questions – "What is your family?", "What do you seek in this city?", and "What do you wish from us?" The adventurers answered them swiftly and truthfully, confessing that they were there in search of the Star of Mo-Pelar . Satisfied, the Norns provided them information and allowed them to pass. Inside the temple they found a rather handsome human male seated on a black stone tablet, dressed in simple boots , tunic , and trousers . Standing up to address them, he proclaimed himself to be the "unlucky Balder, friend to all he knows. Those of you who would weep for him, hold forth your hand." Those who did found a tear-drop of amber appear in their palms before the mysterious figure vanished.</p>
<h2>Realm</h2>
<p>Balder lived alongside his wife Nanna on the plane of Ysgard , in the realm of Asgard , within his own hall known as Breidablik , or "Broad Splendor". It was believed by many to be one of the most beautiful godly halls in all of Asgard, comparable to the Gilded Hall of the Sensates , though far more rowdier. Balder himself spent little time within the hall, often busying himself elsewhere. The hall was governed in his stead by three individuals, known as the Wise Councilors of Baldur, who each represented one of his core aspects – that of a handsome man, a warrior, and a sage.</p>
<p>As befitting Balder's holy symbol, the goblets in Breidablik were all encrusted with jewels. Usually these were gems of a lesser sort, such as agates , mica , or pyrite .</p>
<p>Only the most beautiful of his petitioners were found here, with all others turned away. Like other Norse petitioners they were prone to feats of valor, just as fast and strong as any other. Unlike their god, Balder's petitioners were noted as being far more vain than other Norse petitioners. They also were the only militia in all of Ysgard to wear unmatching uniforms and they placed greater importance on battle magic, the latter of which was praised by the bards among them as making them more dangerous than other Norse petitioners. They commonly wore bright cloaks with gold stitching and wielded weapons that had gold inlays, the most common being blazing spears.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Balder spent much of his time away from the halls of Breidablik, attempting to woo other beautiful gods and bestowing gifts unto those who worshiped him. He was particularly known for rewarding unsightly individuals, who had demonstrated their worth through some sort of great self-sacrificial deed, by blessing them to be more charismatic. He also was known for to lend his horses out on a whim to his champions when they went on quests.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Balder was devoutly loyal to his father Odin and the rest of the Aesir . He in turn was greatly beloved by nearly all members of the Norse pantheon, with the exception of Loki. Many sought him as a traveling companion on their adventures and they paid close attention to what he told about his dreams. Outside of the Norse pantheon, most gods that met Balder were endeared towards him, with even those who normally weren't friendly towards humans managing to have good words to say about him. About the only powers that truly disliked him were those that represented hatred and plague.</p>
<p>In addition to being the twin brother of Hod, Balder was a sibling of Hermod and Tyr . He was married to a member of the Aesir by the name of Nanna and with her had a son that they named Forseti.</p>
<p>Unlike many deities, Baldur was served by no proxies , as he felt he had no need for them.</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Balder was honored on a number of worlds by bards and skalds , elves , gnomes , sages, and some members of the philosophical planar faction known as the Society of Sensation .</p>
<p>Though a disproportionate number of those in his clergy were very beautiful or handsome individuals, it was not an actual requirement to become a priest. The clergy dressed rather simply, often wearing silver helmets and chainmail for their priestly vestments. They had access to spells from the spheres of all , charm , divination , protection , and summoning , as well as the domains of good , healing , and knowledge . They also possessed a unique ability to charm members of the opposite sex that gazed upon them.</p>
<p>The cult of Balder was divided into two facets, though like other faiths focused on Norse gods it preached acceptance of fate, though more so than others tried to laugh it off, and all clergy were expected to treat the less fortunate with both compassion and kindness. One sect of the cult focused on teaching others to grow closer to the gods by creating objects of beauty, claiming that doing so would help one to achieve a higher emotional and mental state of being. This sect also believed the gods to be source of artistic inspiration and thus deserving of gratitude and respect. The other side of the cult of Balder was more focused on tragedy and rebirth, preaching that new opportunities and hope for the future always arose from adversity.</p>
<p>Like most Norse temples, those dedicated to Balder were sturdy forts, though they were said to be the most beautiful and well-designed out of all Norse temples, being designed with each particular environment or location in mind. Each typically sported a small armory and a workshop or studio where the clergy could receive Balder's divine inspiration. They were often found in areas with high populations of gnomes, who adorned the temples with their gnomish artistry. The temples were also adorned in great carvings and paintings. Due to the circumstances of Balder's death, his temples banned all manner of weapons and wooden tools.</p>
<p>Sacrifices to Balder traditionally took place once a month and in the form of a crafted item. His holy days fell on full moons.</p>
