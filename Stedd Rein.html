<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Stedd was the youngest child of Deldron Rein , but perhaps the most well-known after his treacherous sister Jesym .</p>
<p>For his leadership and heroism in battle, Stedd was an idol of many of the younger humans and half-elves of Loudwater.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early History</h3>
<p>As the son of Deldron Rein, leader of the Red Boar Trading Coster and owner of properties such as the Red Boar Inn , Stedd was born to the wealthy and influential Rein family of Loudwater, which had immigrated from Waterdeep some six decades earlier.</p>
<p>Circa 1361 DR , Stedd Rein went south to Amn to receive an education at the renowned College of War in Athkatla . There, he studied military matters for some eight years. After he graduated, he would soon have the opportunity to put what he'd learned into practice.</p>
<h3>Night of the Blood Moon</h3>
<p>When Stedd returned to the Delimbiyr Vale in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , while he was still en route to Loudwater, Deldron departed the city to greet his son and conduct business in Daggerford . He had taken with him the Red Boar Trading Coster's sizeable guard, and unwittingly helped to leave Loudwater hopelessly vulnerable. For at the rising of a blood-red moon , Malarite lycanthropes surged out of the High Forest and fell upon Loudwater and the surrounding homesteads in a vicious conflict known as the Night of the Blood Moon .</p>
<p>A magical communication alerted Deldron about the attack, and the Reins and their Red Boars hastened to return. While he followed close behind, Deldron sent Stedd ahead with half his forces and they arrived in Loudwater on the third day of the conflict, linking with Gauntlets Kalahar Twohands and Harazos Thelbrimm . Twohands and Thelbrimm divided the city into quadrants for defense by their own armies, the Red Boar guard, and the elven house guards. Stedd opened the Red Boar's stores and equipped his forces with nearly forty alchemical silver weapons.</p>
<p>Then, on the third night, the Malarites targeted Standing Stone Hill , which stood at the edge of the city within the elven quadrant, and a vital ritual being conducted there by the Green Regent Galaer Grasswave and his Scions . But while some of the elven house guard battled bravely in its defense, too many of them tarried and even departed their forces to protect their own estates. Learning of the threat, Stedd Rein rallied his Red Boar forces and charged desperately through the Malarites' ranks, fighting all the way with silver blades and battle spells, to reach Standing Stone Hill. It was a valiant effort, but too far and too hard to be successful. By the time they got there, Stedd and his forces discovered only a scant few surviving Scions and the head of Galaer Grasswave mounted on a stake. Thereafter, the moon returned to its regular hue and the Malarites melted back into the woods, marking the battle's end.</p>
<p>Despite this, for his courage and leadership and actions that had yet saved many lives, Stedd Rein earned praise and accolades. When Deldron arrived in the aftermath, he heard many praising his son, and was pleased. It also improved the Rein name, erasing the earlier memory of Jesym's treachery and earning them the support of the Beutaleen'dal elven house, whose new matriarch Ovendal Beutaleen'dal had been saved by Stedd on that third night.</p>
<h3>The Green Regent?</h3>
<p>In the following years, Stedd Rein would be considered the favorite to become a Scion himself and even the next Green Regent in the ceremony held on Shieldmeet in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . But he was rejected by Mielikki herself for both roles, vomiting up the Greendraught as others did, and this was met by stunned silence and surprised gasps. Even more shockingly, the orc Otar would be accepted as Green Regent instead. Even the elven nobility, who'd long opposed the Reins but had supported Stedd, were appalledâ€”the Beutaleen'dals claimed it was evidence of the ceremony being tainted or sabotaged. In contrast, the Phelaniityrs held it up as proof of the Reins' inherent wickedness following Deldron's lumbering business and Jesym's betrayal, but paradoxically maintained the ceremony had also been sabotaged to admit Otar. A few even doubted the validity of all the Scions, which nearly everyone rejected as ridiculous. As for Stedd Rein, he was defiant and made other plans...</p>
