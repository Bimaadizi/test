<p>Karas was a cultist of the Spinner of Shadows in the world of Eberron .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Karas had gray skin and white hair. He wore a chain shirt and wielded a pair of envenomed scimitars .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Darkening of Faer√ªn , Karas served as a leader in the Lords of Dust cult dedicated to the demonic being known as the Spinner of Shadows. As part of a plot to free their patron, Karas and the rakshasa Gnomon prepared a ritual in their Stormreach hideout to gain access to the hidden Spinner's Prison in Khyber . When the Church of the Silver Flame discovered them and attacked their hideout, Karas allowed Gnomon to die first before engaging in battle himself. When he too fell, his sacrifice finished the ritual and the path to the Spinner's Prison was opened for his allies.</p>
