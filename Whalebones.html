<p>The Whalebones were an archipelago located in the Trackless Sea , located east of Ruathym and north of the Korinn Archipelago . The islands were called the Whalebones because of the whale skeletons that could be found on the islands' beaches.</p>
<p>Petty, warmongering kings ruled over the islands, often skirmishing in battles whose casualties rarely exceeded a few dozen. The larger islands were home to massive rocs that were used as mounts by the storm giants of Maelstrom . The islanders paid tribute to the rocs and giants by leaving them food and treasure.</p>
<p>Finback , the tallest island of the Whalebones, held the lair of the crazed bronze dragon , Tauntzoth of the Rocks , prior to her death.</p>
