<p>The Red Sword was a mercenary company of 2,000 members that was active in northeast Faerûn sometime before the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The company was known to work for the Red Wizards of Thay , although it was speculated that the Red Wizards hired them solely because "Red" was also in the company's name.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the Simbul learned of the Red Sword's connection to her enemies, the Red Wizards, she and her entourage intercepted them at Mistbridge under a flag of truce in hopes of convincing them not to attack her land of Aglarond . The mercenaries instead insulted the Simbul repeatedly, and ultimately fired a volley of arrows at her and her allies. Losing her temper, the Simbul flew into the air wreathed in flames and—without any assistance —annihilated all 2,000 mercenaries with her spells. The story of what happened to the Red Sword was the single best-known tale about the Simbul as of the mid–14 th century DR, and it had made her power (and her temper) famous and feared across Faerûn .</p>
