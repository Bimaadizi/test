<p>Narm Tamaraith was a young apprentice mage of the midâ€“14 th century DR who became the lover and husband of the wielder of spellfire , Shandril Shessair .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Narm decided to become a mage after he saw a battle between two wizards that killed his parents. He became the apprentice of the wizard Marimmar the Magnificent , a good but slow magic teacher. In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , the pair went to the ruined Myth Drannor to acquire magical treasure but Marimmar was quickly killed by bone devils there, who then tormented Narm. Narm was rescued by Lanseril Snowmantle and Illistyl Elventree of the Knights of Myth Drannor and brought to Shadowdale , but he desired to return to Myth Drannor to confront and overcome his trauma.</p>
<p>There, Narm saw Shandril, who was a prisoner of the Cult of the Dragon and tried to rescue her. The two helped each other and immediately fell in love, later marrying in Shadowdale. There, Narm was also briefly tutored in the magical arts by more powerful wizards like Jhessail Silvertree and Elminster . Narm and Shandril would become closer still as companions in the continuous fighting against all the evil organizations that hunted Shandril.</p>
<p>In the end, however, after a bloody battle Narm was fatally injured. Shandril thought this was her fault (although this was not true) and used her last spellfire to heal Narm. She decided to sacrifice herself to stop the hunt and told Narm to fall in love again with another girl. She then turned her spellfire against herself and disappeared.</p>
