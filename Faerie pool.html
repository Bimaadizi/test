<p>The Faerie pools were small pools of water tainted with an odd mineral in the rocks, located across the Sword Lands , Laerakond .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The pools produced gases that cause an "air frost" (snowflakes) that, if inhaled, caused brief but vivid hallucinations . Sages believed those gases were product of a mineral infected with the Spellplague . People with strong will could control those hallucinations and a few ones knew how to use that gas to divine the future.</p>
<p>Common people believed the Faerie pools were portals to the Feywild , and that fickle fey produced the hallucinations, hence the name of the pools.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Faerie pools began to appear in Laerakond after the Spellplague.</p>
