<p>Golin Vend was a resident of Beregost during the midâ€“14 th century DR . He often acted as a guide of sorts to newcomers in town.</p>
<p>He was quite proud that his town boasted the "best smithy in all the realms", Taerom Fuiruim , who ran the Thunderhammer Smithy . Golin considered the Red Sheaf to be a lower-quality inn, when compared to the Jovial Juggler or Burning Wizard .</p>
