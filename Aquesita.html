<h2>History</h2>
<p>Karsus's cousin lived in the 36 th century NY . When Candlemas visited the enclave of Karsus, Lady Aquesita sent him a calling card, prompting him to meet her. During their encounter, Aquesita explained that she was Karsus's only living relative and expressed concern about his well-being, owing to his instability and genius. She requested that Candlemas keep her informed about Karsus's activities and thoughts, as she wanted to stay updated on her cousin’s progress. Despite his initial hesitation, Candlemas agreed to help Aquesita. The two would often be in contact, and become very drawn to each other.</p>
<p>Prior to the Fall of Netheril in the Year of Sundered Webs, −339 DR , Aquesita declared that she was in love with Candlemas. Candlemas tried to get her to travel back in time with him as Karsus was accumulating god-like power, but Aquesita believed her cousin would succeed. As Candlemas and his companions left, Aquesita ran over to her cousin, but he transformed into stone. The enclave began to plummet, and exploded.</p>
