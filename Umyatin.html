The murals depicted, to her judgement, two different emperors of Imaskar, Umyatin and Omanond . The figure she believed to represent Umyatin was surrounded by two demonic figures: one of a dragon with a lion 's head, and one of a midnight-black centaur with a demon 's horn and a vicious look of glee in his eyes. Umyatin was reaching out to the latter, which was labeled "Mizar".</p>
