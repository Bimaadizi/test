<p>The Bay of Chessenta was a large bay in the southern Sea of Fallen Stars .</p>
<p>It was the preferred means of travel in Chessenta as the Chessentan roads were poorly maintained in the late 15th century DR . Oar-powered Chessentan triremes plied the waters of the often windless bay and there were many small harbors for ships to pull into. In the years after the Spellplague , piracy became a problem and a band of pirates known as the Crimson Sea Maritime Priakos operated in the bay.</p>
