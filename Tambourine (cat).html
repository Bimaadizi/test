<p>Tambourine was a lazy cat who lived in the kitchen of the Elfsong Tavern in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tambourine was a white and fluffy creature with huge blue eyes and a pink nose.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Tambourine was "employed" by the cooks of the Elfsong Tavern in vain hopes that the beast would be killing rats in the establishment's cellars. However, Tambourine himself showed little interest in pest control or any other vocation. Those who knew mundane or magical ways of talking to animals quickly realized that the lazy cat possessed a self-important attitude, thinking it to be the monarch of the tavern and all humanoids its subservient apes. The cat would also attempt to order said "apes" to dispose of the rats in Elfsong's basement.</p>
