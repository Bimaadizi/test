<p>Lord Venali Starym was a member of the Starym clan of Myth Drannor .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Born in the Year of Fallen Guards, 111 DR , Venali was the first son of the clan patriarch Illitran Starym .</p>
<p>Circa 650 DR , Venali was the official clan heir while the proper heir, Josidiah Starym , was missing.</p>
<p>He served on the Council of Twelve as a House Lord of the clan, from its founding in the Year of Austere Ceremonies, 667 DR until its end. Venali was chief among those who exploited their influence to acquire favored status for their house or clan in Myth Drannor's sister cities.</p>
<p>Thanks to the conspiring of Lord Venali and the Council and of the Guild of Wizards, Conjurers, and Enchanters , the Ildacer clan lost their estates and much of their wealth, holdings, and status in the Year of the Emerald Citadel, 704 DR .</p>
<p>When Illitran passed and Venali became House Lord, he took up the Starym moonblade , and wielded it passably well for many years.</p>
<p>At end of the Weeping War in the Year of Doom, 714 DR , when the Army of Darkness attacked Myth Drannor, Venali hide in the family crypt and worried more about protecting his wealth than the city. When the fiends discovered him there anyway, he used the blade to teleport to safety—warped by the mythal , his own cowardice and self-preservation, as well as a small part of his spirit, were imbued in the moonblade , giving it the power to teleport itself and its wielder out of danger.</p>
<p>Venali escaped to Starym holdings deep in the Hullack Forest with his kin, where he lived out his days. Finally, in the Year of the Cracked Turtle, 924 DR , he died of a strange wasting disease. The moonblade was inherited by his niece, Seldanna the Cold .</p>
