<p>Desert Wind was a variety of enchanted scimitar created on the Sword Coast North in the late 14 th century DR , with the original being rumored to originate from the genies of Calimshan .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>There existed three variants of Desert Winds , each possessing +1 , +2 , or +8 enchantments that made the edge deadlier and guided the wielder's hand towards the target. All three versions were capable of dealing additional damage with magical fire with each slash.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>A Desert Wind scimitar could be created from an enchanted scimitar and a slab of adamantite .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The origin of the original Desert Wind was disputed but many sages attributed its creation to the genies of Calimshan who managed to capture the desert heat within the blade. There existed accounts of the weapon being used to land a single cut, leaving opponents to surrender after tasting the blistering heat of the desert.</p>
<p>More common versions of Desert Winds with a simpler +1 enchantment were forged by Master Blacksmith Marrok of the Shining Knight Arms and Armor shop in Neverwinter to help the heroes who sought the cure for the dreaded Wailing Death in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Later the same year, more powerful versions were created by Master Blacksmith Barun of Beorunna's Well to help the forces of Neverwinter stand against Lady Aribeth the Betrayer , who led a marching army of Luskan in the deadly but short-lived Neverwinter–Luskan war.</p>
