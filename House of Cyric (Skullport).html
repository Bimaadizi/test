<p>The House of Cyric was a temple to Cyric located in Skullport as of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Skullport was located in Undermountain beneath Waterdeep , and perhaps more importantly, beneath Mount Waterdeep , a holy site to followers of Cyric as it had been where their god ascended from human to deity during the Time of Troubles .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The temple was one of only a few places in all of Faerûn in which banelar nagas loyal to Cyric were known to dwell.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , the only presence of the church of Cyric in Skullport was a small cult—little more than a gang —that was looking to amass converts. The original members of this cult were seven clerics of Cyric banished to Undermountain by the Lords of Waterdeep in the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR . These seven found their way to Skullport, and in about three years they grew their ranks to include five more clerics and over thirty lay followers under the leadership of the charismatic priest Menes Azludde .</p>
<p>Operating the cult as little more than a criminal organization, Menes began pursuing ambitions beyond the scope of his real powers, and attempted to set in motion a tangled conspiracy meant to sow chaos and upend the status quo in Skullport. This, of course, attracted the ire of most of the Shadow Port's major players, including the Harpers , the Agents of the Eye , the Dark Dagger , the Keepers , and the Iron Ring . For a time, they were infiltrated by Juz'la , a yuan-ti tainted one , however she was driven to the surface by her masters following her genuine conversion to the faith. Ultimately, the cult caught the attention of the Skulls of Skullport themselves, which was essentially a death sentence.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, by early in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the House of Cyric had been established, and had become a prominent place of the Black Sun's worship on par with the Twin Towers of the Eternal Eclipse in Amn . Notably, it hosted banelar nagas, powerful creatures which had been loyal to Bane before that deity's death fourteen years prior. Following Bane's return later that year, most banelars returned to their former god, however at least one retained its alliance with Cyric and the House.</p>
