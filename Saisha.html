<p>Saisha , or hammerlock , was a paralyzing ingestion poison used by Zhentarim in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>The effects of saisha were such that soon after ingestion, the target became incapable of moving, with their joints tightly locked up; only the lungs and eyes could move, while the jaw hung slack. The joint locks were so effective that they gave the drug the name of "hammerlock", referencing the fact that joints had to be broken with a hammer afterwards. It lasted for about three hours.</p>
<h2>Production</h2>
<p>It was made out of herbs from Tashalar . The recipe was a secret.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Saisha was available to the Zhentarim in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , and in use by Calivar Murpeth on 1369Â DR , who employed it on the cook Gustal Sorold , the harlot Talantha , and attempted to use it on the scrivener Maervidal Iloster , all of which he was to kill afterwards.</p>
