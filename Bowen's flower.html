<p>Bowen's flower was a small flower that popped up in scattered patches in the mountainous regions of Cormyr in central Faer√ªn .</p>
<h2>Growth</h2>
<p>This flower was unable to reproduce well but rather it spread like a weed. It wasn't found everywhere but in dense plots some distance away from one another.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>When ground up and mixed in a drink, the Bowen's flower acted as a mild sedative. While it wasn't useful as a sleeping agent in most cases, it was particularly effective against bugbears , rendering them unconscious within minutes.</p>
