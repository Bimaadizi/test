<p>Muzhahajaarnadah (loosely translates from Alzhedo as "the city of shadow"), also commonly referred to as Dark Calimport , Calimport Muzad or simply Muzad , was a multi-tiered labyrinthine undercity beneath Calimshan 's capital city Calimport . Composed of numerous layers of buildings and chambers from across the centuries of Calimport rebuilding, it functionally operated as its own part of the city.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The depths and labyrinths of the Muzhahajaarnadah were nearly immeasurable, ranging in different places from depths of 6 feet (1.8 meters) to nearly 0.5 miles (800 meters) beneath the surface. It was composed of all manner of caverns, partially ruined but intact chambers, courtyards and streets, even whole buildings – the likes of arenas, armories, hidden libraries, crypts and tombs, and great halls. Some of these ancient areas were so forgotten, they had not felt the steps of adventurers in centuries. This was all a result of the Calimshites preferring to, or having no choice but to, rebuild atop the old whenever Calimport suffered great destructive events, rather than clearing away the rubble.</p>
<p>The oldest parts of the Muzad, its very foundations, were made up of the crumbling sewers and basements of ancient Coramshan .</p>
<h3>Upper Muzad</h3>
<p>The uppermost layer of the Muzhahajaarnadah was composed of the original streets of Calimport's three richest and central wards – the Grand , Jewel , and Palace wards – which had been paved over with the intention of providing a larger space, out of sight, for the slaves and servants of the city's upper classes. It was accessible through gates that opened into the Dock Ward and other outer wards. While some light came in through these gates and streamed down through the stairwells up to the elevated streets, illumination was otherwise provided by torches .</p>
<p>The "Upper Muzad", as it came to be known by many, largely operated as an ordinary part of Calimport.</p>
<h3>Sewers</h3>
<p>Part of the undercity was composed of the two separate systems of sewers and waterways, which were in part the repurposed halls of an ancient svirfneblin city. The older, defunct system was known as the "Lost Sewers". Its abandoned tunnels, connected to many ancient buried cellars, were often partially collapsed, destroyed, or blocked in places. Over time, the leaders of the wererats that came to inhabit the Lost Sewers would set about creating connections between the Lost Sewers and the city's functioning sewer system.</p>
<p>The passages of the newer, functioning sewer system were denoted as being either one of two types based on their size, primary and secondary. Primary tunnels were the more easily navigable of the city, measuring 30 feet (9.1 meters) across and had 5‑foot (1.5‑meter) wide walkways on each side. Additionally, stepping stones over the sewage could be found every 50 yards (46 meters). Secondary tunnels were about half as wide, with pathways only on one side. The sewers also had many other pipes, ranging in diameter from 1​ to ​8 feet (0.3​ to ​2.4 meters), though these were in no way mapped .</p>
<p>Much of the city's waste entered the sewers through grates and eventually emptied out into the Shining Sea , east of the harbor proper. The sewers also had a number of surface shafts , connections to the above ground city where rungs were set in the walls for use as ladders , capped by covers known as "manholes".</p>

<h2>Dungeon Ecology</h2>
<p>The Muzad was inhabited by all manner of creatures and monsters, ranging from sentient clouds of gas to rats and other feral vermin that roamed the middle and lower levels of the undercity.</p>
<h2>Groups of Interest</h2>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Much of the illicit activity that went on throughout Calimport was in one way or another linked to the Muzhahajaarnadah. For instance, over 60% of illicit trade in magic and weapons in the city occurred in the Upper Muzad, beneath the Jewel Ward.</p>
<p>In the mid–14 th century DR, a large portion of the illicit trade in the Muzad was dominated by Sultan Faruk el Pesarkhal , the twelfth son of Syl-Pasha Ralan el Pesarkhal . And Pasha Daud el Vehmet was involved in the black market trade of potions and spell components .</p>
<p>One of the most coveted hubs for trading was the Dark Bazaars , wandering arcane bazaars often found on the upper levels of the Muzad. The only way to access them was to be invited by their mysterious caretakers, the Gray Callers . These gray- robed figures would show up seemingly at random, across both Calimport and Calimport Below, to invite individuals to the bazaars. This occurred no less than once a month, but no more than once a tenday . If someone accepted their beckoning, the Gray Caller would soon lead them down a path that opened into the Dark Bazaar. Those who attempted to teleport to a Dark Bazaar would find themselves amidst nothing but mists and shadows, filled with whispering far off voices.</p>
<p>Within the Dark Bazaars, assassins and thieves mingled amongst all manner of creatures. The few written accounts of the bazaars recount such varied visitors as archmages , dragons , kobolds, nishruu , nyth , and even tanar'ri lords . Attendees traded in foul magic, forbidden lore, illicit secrets, lost knowledge, and even magic items such as divination spell scrolls , bottles of dream vapor , and rare elven kiira . One of the most common methods of trade in lore and secrets in the bazaars was that of tales.</p>
<p>The one cardinal rule for trade in the Dark Bazaars was "Ask or speak wisely, but only spare a secret or knowledge equal to that which you seek". Attendees could only ever trade one secret for another, and once their secret was given, regardless of whether or not it was understood by the recipient, they would suddenly disappear, dissipating into gray mist and returning back to where they had first met the Gray Caller who had beckoned them into the bazaar, as if it all had never happened.</p>
<p>Due to the sensitive nature of secret trading, scrying was expressly prohibited outside of a relevant trading situation. If it or violence was brought to bear within the Dark Bazaars, the offending party would be similarly disappeared.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Muzhahajaarnadah was inhabited by a wide array of people, from simple outcasts to priests of god darks, criminal elements, lycanthropes, skulks , those on the run from Calimport's upper class, and albino humans that had adapted to life below ground. The demonym for these various inhabitants of the Muzad was "Muzaddi".</p>
<p>The wererat population of the Muzad numbered no less than 500 in total by 1370 DR . They largely inhabited the Lost Sewers, divided into seven separate consortiums.</p>
<p>One group of note in the mid–to–late 14 th century DR was a tribe of kobolds , led by a Chieftain Skax . They had been moved to Calimshan from the Clawrift in the Northdark in 1364 DR by the Bregan D'aerthe as part of a plot against House Basadoni , only to later be abandoned by their captors. By 1370 DR, there were nearly a thousand members of the tribe.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Muzhahajaarnadah was quite well known to the people of Calimport, its reputation comparable to that of Waterdhavians and Undermountain . Likewise, the existence of the Temple of Old Night was common knowledge, though not the true extent of its reach. However, few knew of the Muzad from actual experience. The various rumors and surrounding it were more often than not the products of fear and nightmares than truth. The multitude of mysteries surrounding the undercity's dark, hidden depths was comparable not only to Undermountain, but to ruined wonders of Myth Drannor and Shoonach . Likewise, the existence of the Temple of Old Night was common knowledge, though not the true extent of its reach.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the −1838 DR , the red dragon Ylveraasahlisar attacks Calimport out of a desire to avenge one of her offspring, destroying two-thirds of the city in the process. The Rose Dragon wrested control of the city from the Raor bakkal and demanded immediate reconstruction efforts. Not wanting to displease their new draconic ruler, the Calishite builders chose to smooth out the rubble and build
atop the old structures, consequently creating much of the Muzhahajaarnadah.</p>
<p>In the Year of Tribes Reunited, −648 DR , in a last ditch effort to save the Calimshan Empire from the conquering drow, who had that point had taken over one quarter of Calimport, large swathes of Calimport were destroyed by a combined force of priests wizards so as to bury the drows' temples and partially subterranean villas. Some of their buildings ended up relatively intact amidst their burial. Those would wizards then help to rebuild Calimport, making certain to seal off any connections between the city and Underdark through means of stone and new buildings. However, within a decade the drow of Old Shanatar managed to reopen those old passages and reestablish their hold on the Muzad.</p>
<p>In the Year of Whispering Stones, −373 DR , the Sharrans establish themselves in the Temple of Old Night after they destroyed their surface temple, the Basilica of Night , in a conflict with Talonites .</p>
<p>Sometime during the Eye Tyrant Wars , one of the early attempts by the beholders to invade Calimport was done through the Muzad.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Icy Axe, 123 DR , with the death of Caleph Hazamir al Aktorral the Shoon Imperium neglects Calimport, leaving numerous buildings in the city to deteriorate. Calimport begins to be referred to as the "Old City", as many flock to the Muzhahajaarnadah, expanding both its size and population. During this time the undercity also saw a rise in its monstrous population, as the Old City had fewer garrisons.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Unforgotten Fire, 319 DR , the ruler of the Shoon Imperium , Shoon VII , took drastic measures in ridding Ankhapur , Calimport, Innarlith , and Ithmong of crime. He ordered oil to be poured into thei sewers, causing the Great Fires that destroyed the four cities nearly completely, with the death toll reaching over three million people.</p>
<p>Around the Seventh Age of Calimshan , a new sewer system was constructed beneath Calimport. The Seventh Age also saw an outbreak of lycanthropy in Calimport in 701 DR , later dubbed the Moon Plague . While most of the lycanthropes fled the city after the full moons of Tarsakh and Mirtul , some chose to remain behind and inhabit the Muzad.</p>
<p>In the Year of Ruins Reborn, 911 DR , the self-proclaimed Syl-Pasha Bollus el Kahdan found his efforts to rebuild Calimport repeatedly interfered with by powers of the undercity. He retaliates by flooding the ancient sewers and buried avenues of Calimport Below with oil and igniting it, an event later known as the Deepblaze . However, when the fumes and heat died down, the undercity was more secure than ever before and better able to access the city above.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Bloodbird, 1346 DR , baseless rumors spread around the Lands of Intrigue that some 80,000 drow were lurking in the Forest of Mir . This stirred up panic in both Calimshan and Tethyr . In Calimport, this lead to people venturing into the Muzad with the aiming of murdering any drow they came across.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , attempts by powers within the Calishite government to get involved with underworld politics leads to the Darkstalker Wars . Amidst the chaos of this underworld conflict, the magic unleashed by Jarlaxle and others caused a few buildings in the Sholeh Sabban to crumbled down into the Muzad.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR , Artemis Entreri , with the help of Jarlaxle and the Bregan D'aerthe, assaulted the palace of House Basadoni from below. They entered through the sewers with a force of forty drow and hundreds of kobolds that the Bregan D'aerthe had brought with them from Clawrift.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the Trades Conflagration engulfed half of the Grand Ward, destroying the Marekh Sabban and consequently numerous areas of the Upper Muzad that were beneath it. The fires also struck the Cajaan Sabban , where the four marble khanduqs of the Cajaan Market burned to the ground and the vast sums of gold stored within them melted, pouring down into the Muzad to be collected by the undercity's denizens of dubious repute. This gold amounted to 10,000 gp and 2,500 trade bars .</p>
