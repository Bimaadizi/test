<p>Beasthearts were specialty priests of the Church of Malar who reveled in the bloodthirsty savagery of the Beastlord , often loosing their humanity in the process.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Beasthearts spent most of their time worshiping Malar by living in the wilderness like savages.</p>
<p>A dozen beasthearts served Huntmaster Baerdeth Malagar in the Lodge of the Great Hunt in Zhentil Keep .</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>All beasthearts were accompanied by a pervailing scent that appeared to be a combination of sweat, animal musk, and blood. They preferred to cater to their animalistic needs. This was accomplished by living out in nature and killing prey with their bare hands. Their human side usually only surfaced during a challenging hunt where the use of wit and strategy aided their endeavor.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>A beastheart had a special blood bond with a predatory animal type of their choice. The animal type would never attack the beastheart when encountered out in the wild. The beastlord could also communicate with the animal of their blood bond once per day.</p>
<p>Beasthearts could incite a type of berserker rage that made them more deadly during combat and able to shrug off terrible wounds. There was a slight chance that the beastheart would temporarily lose their humanity when entering into one of these rages, believing in their mind for several hours that they were an animal and behaving accordingly.</p>
<p>These individuals were uncomfortable in civilized areas which negatively affected their combat skills and prevented them from inciting a rage.</p>
<p>Beasthearts could not turn undead .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Beasthearts wore rough clothing or animal skins, always with the headpiece of a ferocious predator such as a bear or wolf that they had killed with their bare hands. Most beasthearts favored the spear , battleaxe , or greatsword in combat.</p>
