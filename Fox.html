<h2>History</h2>
<p>One source claimed that foxes were never native to Toril, and were actually brought from Earth , most likely France , by an adventurous halfling trader named Altho Minstrelwish around 12 DR . He had plans to sell their fur (particularly their tails, termed "brushes") for fashionable attire, but found few halflings were interested because of their distinct smell. Fox meat, whether roasted or stewed, was even less popular. In the end, he let the foxes run wild, and in time they displaced the native Faerûnian lynx . The hin word for "fox" was rennard , after the French word for a fox, renard . However, it was known that foxes existed on Toril far before the 1 st century DR , even in the times of ancient Netheril .</p>
<h2>Significance</h2>
<p>According to Qukoku , the guiding philosophy of the Iulutiun and Angulutiun peoples of the Great Glacier , the fox was an utqukoku animal representing patience.</p>
<h3>Usages</h3>
<p>Foxes were hunted for their pelts, which were worth between three and five gp at the market. Foxes were often kept as familiars. The Iulutiun utilized a special pit trap to hunt foxes called a dinjik .</p>
