<p>The Deep Glen Graveyard was an old and expansive graveyard in the King's Forest of Cormyr , adjacent to the village of Deep Glen .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The graveyard spread from the edge of the village into the surrounding forest. Among the grounds was a section of small tombs, devoted to Purple Dragons and wealthy villagers from Deep Glen and Eveningstar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Early in the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar , the drow forces descended on the village and slaughtered the inhabitants, followed shortly by the necromancers of House Szind . The Szind necromancers animated the fresh remains of the villagers and then began ransacking the graveyard, excavating old graves to obtain ever-more zombies and skeletons .</p>
<p>Constal Adamor Thellik and the Amaunatori priest Barana Talmere heard of this desecration, and sent a team to disrupt the necromancers. They fought through the village and the graveyard, destroying the undead and slaying the necromancers there. While it was hardly a grand victory, the pale rod was captured from the necromancers, and the grave wrappings discovered.</p>
