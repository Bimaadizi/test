<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following Rolga Stumprock‎'s death, the blade was interred along with its mistress within the deepest levels of the Elven Catacombs under Castle Cormanthor . The series of interconnected dwarven tombs were protected by ancient constructs and magics that allowed people in need to claim the artifacts from the crypts if the appropriate donation was made.</p>
