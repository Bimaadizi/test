<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Song of Selûne, a young, bored, and impulsive goddess Selûne "borrowed" her father's wand of power and used the wand to fly away in a bubble of force, so that she might experience life in other realms. In time, she traveled to another plane and was smitten by a mysterious and attractive warrior, a lord of his people. The stranger persuaded her to use the wand to transport him and his followers to Toril , where they planned to settle. However, once they landed, he revealed he was the monstrous Imgig Zu , intent on conquest and ruin. He seized her father's wand of power and intended to kill the deceived goddess.</p>
<p>Fortunately, with the distraction of a brave young wizard , Selûne was able to escape. The goddess used her own life force to imprison the monsters inside a pocket dimension within a gigantic moonstone , known as Selûne's Eye . However, the wand of power remained in Imgig's clutches.</p>
<p>Having eventually escaped from the gem, Imgig Zu used the wand of power to release the rest of his people from the Selûne's Eye .</p>
