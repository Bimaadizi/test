<p>Nymphs were fey said to be nature's embodiment of physical beauty; they were also guardians of wild places.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nymphs were about the height and weight of a female elf , but they were blindingly beautiful.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Some considered nymphs to be the most wild and capricious type of fey.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Nymphs in cold climates were often known to hunt upon the backs of wolves .</p>
<p>Other types of nymphs besides the normal forest kind included grain nymphs and unseelie nymphs .</p>
<h3>Homelands</h3>
<p>Compared to Faer√ªn , nymphs were a more common occurrence on the Evermeet , though still relatively rare. There they inhabited forests, glades, and valleys.</p>
<p>In the Zakhara region's Crowded Sea , nymphs could be found on the island chain of Nada al-Hazan and the archipelago of Jazayir al-Sartan .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Nymphs were sometimes sent as agents of the elven gods Corellon Larethian or Erevan Ilesere .</p>
<p>Among the elves that inhabited Evermeet, nymphs were viewed as being spiritual representatives of the elven gods and they in turn seemed to be positively inclined towards them, rarely harming elves. Some of the island's elves, especially those of the green and silver variety, purposely sought them out.</p>
