<p>Kagyar was a strange immortal being from the world of Mystara that was worshiped as a deity by some of its inhabitants, primarily its dwarves . On Toril he was considered to be an obscure deity.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kagyar had the appearance of a savage, hairy and bearded savage man with deep-set, somewhat beady eyes. Dressed in a set of plain gray robes and hood.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Kagyar's view on life revolved entirely around artistic pursuits, caring very little about what was going on around him and whether non-creative mortals lived or died.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Normally, Kagyar only interacted with mortals when he wanted to persuade them to save some endangered work of art. But sometimes, he would provide struggling artists the inspiration, motivation, or spiritual help they needed to achieve the great potential they had.</p>
<p>Beyond his home world of Mystara, Kagyar engaged in activities on a variety of planes across the multiverse .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Kagyar carried a hammer and chisel with him wherever he went, having them double as weapons. These had a +4 and +3 enchantment respectively.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kagyar began life on Mystara as Ka-Gar, a member of a mortal race of neanderthal -like humanoids . In this life he lived as a cave painter and rock carver. At some point, Kagyar obtained immortality.</p>
<p>Some time in the 14 th century DR , Kagyar reached beyond his native world and contacted a dwarf on Toril by the name of Norin Bonebreaker . He granted the man a limited list of clerical spells and tasked him with helping the unfortunate, but only in secrecy.</p>
