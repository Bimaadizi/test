<p>Furnaces , also known as furnace helms , were an early form of spelljamming helm that continued to see occasional use on spelljammers long after greater advancements in helm design had been made.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Unlike other spelljamming helms, which took magic energy from spellcasters , a furnace produced motion for spelljammers by consuming magic items with their flames, though they could not destroy magic items impervious to fire. And creatures of elemental fire , such as the elmarin , could also be used to power them.</p>
<p>Because they required magic items, fueling furnaces could become quite expensive. Overfeeding a furnace could potentially make it more effective, but also put it in danger of exploding. And due to the fire furnaces produced, they could only be used within wildspace , violently exploding if ever used within the Phlogiston .</p>
<h2>Notable Users</h2>
<p>This variety of helm was commonly seen on ghost ships , the ships of powerful thieves' guilds in wildspace, and on the stripped-down smuggling variant of dragonfly ships. In the latter case, anyone hiring a dragonfly smuggler had to provide a sufficient amount of magic items to power their furnace. They were also occasionally used on viperships and were used early on by eel ships until they were phased out in favor of major and minor helms.</p>
<p>On rare occasions, furnaces that had gotten loose from their ships could be found hurtling through the depths of wildspace on their own, moving at high speeds in relatively straight lines.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in the 14 th century DR , a group of adventurers from Ravens Bluff traveled into wildspace with a spelljammer piloted by the tinker gnome Ignious Rammousdammous to try and stop an incoming meteor referred to as the Hammer of Fire from crashing down upon their city. The spelljammer they traveled on came with a dingy that was powered by a furnace helm. According to some sources, the adventurers may have been forced to use their own spelljammer to destroy the Hammer of Fire and were then forced to used the dingy and its furnace to return home safely.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Rumors floated around claiming that furnaces may have originally been developed by the arcane .</p>
