<p>Silverback was a species of fish that inhabited the Imnestream river in Amn 's Zehoarast Floodplains .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Silverback fish were abundant in Imnestream's cold rushing waters, where it was a common catch during fishing seasons. Along with bluefins , silverbacks were fished via nets or spears . Imnestream's narrow channels and plungepools were perfect for silverback fishing as the river's rapid waters forced them into certain spots of calmer water.</p>
