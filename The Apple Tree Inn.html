<p>The Apple Tree Inn was a ryokan (inn) in Aru in Wa in the 1770s on the Wa Calendar . Small and unremarkable, it stood in the Pilgrim District, near the gate to the Shining Temple of Bishamon , and was likely named for the temple's sacred apple tree.</p>
<p>The thief Komatsu stayed at The Apple Tree Inn in Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR) , and might've been confronted by adventurers there.</p>
