<p>The Morndinsamman (a dwarven term meaning "shield brothers on high" or "high dwarves") or Moradinsamman . was the group name of the dwarven pantheon .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The majority of the Morndinsamman resided in Dwarfhome (when it was still located on Mount Celestia ) under the leadership of Moradin , creator of the dwarves. Duerra and Laduguer lived in Hammergrim , having been exiled by Moradin.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1383 DR , Moradin led the Morndinsamman on a crusade against the dark powers of Hammergrim, slaying Duerra and Laduguer, but at the cost of Gorm and Haela.</p>
<p>As of 1479 DR , Moradin, Berronar , Clangeddin , Dugmaren , Dumathoin , Marthammor , Sharindlar , Thard , and Vergadain remained in Dwarfhome as part of the Morndinsamman. Abbathor was serving Bane as an exarch in Banehold</p>
<p>Following the Second Sundering , by the end of the 15 th century DR , thirteen of the Morndinsamman deities appeared to have been restored to their portfolios as they were before the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR and the Spellplague of 1385 DR ; the exception was Thard Harr , whose status at the time was unknown. The exact circumstances of their return are unclear.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The gods of the Morndinsamman were:</p>
<p>Although typically counted as part of the Morndinsamman, the two duergar deities had been banished by Moradin, making them members-in-exile (in contrast to the drow deities, who were no longer considered part of the Seldarine at all):</p>
<p>Occasionally associated to the Morndinsamman, but also exiled from it, was the derro god Diirinka , an intermediate god of magic, knowledge, and cruelty, as well as his mad twin brother, Diinkarazan . He was considered to be the son of Moradin and Berronar; however, details are scarce.</p>
