<p>Boars were wild relatives of the domestic pig . They were favored animals of the deities Gruumsh , Gwaeron Windstrom , Ilneval , Luthic , Rillifane Rallathil , Shargaas , and Yurtrus .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boars were covered in thick fur, often brown or grayish in color. The exact size of a boar varied from species to species, from roughly human size to roughly the mass of an ogre or similarly sized creature. All varieties of boars were armed with sharp tusks that jutted out from beneath their snout and which were capable of causing serious injury. Boars also had a highly developed sense of smell.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Though not predatory by nature, boars were ill-tempered and territorial, a combination made worse by boars' powerful musculature and sharp tusks.</p>
