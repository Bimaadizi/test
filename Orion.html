<p>Orion of Calimshan , under the alias of Clive the Fearsome , was the leader of a sizeable pirate band based out of the planet Garden in Realmspace in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Orion was both strong and intelligent—exceptionally so on both counts—which made him a formidable opponent. However, few considered him a very attractive man.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As Clive the Fearless, Orion led a band of about one hundred pirates from Clive's Den , one of the several pirate coves located deep within the planet's asteroid cluster at the roots of Yggdrasil's Child .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Clive was in command of a pirate fleet of a dozen small spelljammers , each with a tonnage less than 50.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Orion became the eleventh Clive the Fearsome sometime before 1352 DR , when the previous Clive retired from service and appointed Orion as his replacement.</p>
<p>Sometime after 1360 DR , the neogi had developed a new mobile space station within Realmspace, which garnered the concern of the leaders of several spaceports, including Hisssta , Umberguard , and Waterdeep . These governments hired the aid of some spelljamming adventures to quell the threat.</p>
<p>Clive, too, grew concerned, as the neogi threat was bad for his "business". He also contacted the same adventurers and offered them a star map to the location of a derelict dwarven citadel , which he believed to contain the treasure of Drach Barrachas . The offer was given with no strings attached; Clive simply wanted the adventurers to have the funds to succeed at defeating the neogi.</p>
<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>It was rumored that Clive killed anyone who did not finish a task assigned to them. In truth, Clive would never waste a good man, but piracy was a dangerous life, and so his crews had a high turnover rate nevertheless.</p>
