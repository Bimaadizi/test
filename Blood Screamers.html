<p>The Blood Screamers were a savage and bloodthirsty pack of dire weremole gnomes led by a gnome vampire known as the Blood-Curdling Scream , active in southwest Faerûn in the mid–14 th century DR . All were priests of Urdlen , the Evil One.</p>
<p>The Blood Screamers were based in the Bandit Wastes of Lapaliiya and were the worst of the outlaws there. They launched raids from the Nathaghal Mountains and all the way to the Nath in Halruaa and to the Rathgaunt Hills at the end of the Channath Vale in the Shaar . They terrorized and preyed upon all living creatures they caught in these lands, and had been an ever-present enemy of the gnomes who lived in the Nath and Rathgaunt Hills for decades up to the early 1370s DR.</p>
<p>However, the exact location of their base, whether a warren hideout or a temple to the Crawler Below, remained unknown, though many courageous gnome adventurers had searched for it to end the Blood Screamers' marauding. In fact, they lived in tunnels dug by giant ants beneath the barrens in the western end, east of Lapalgard .</p>
