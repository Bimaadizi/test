<p>The Guth Mountains were a small mountain range found on the Chultan Peninsula of southwest Faer√ªn .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Guth Mountains were found in the southeast corner of Thindol . They held the Black Jungles at bay from creeping further west. The mountains also framed the eastern edge of the Thingulph . The Dolsel Gap passed between the Guth Mountains in the south and the Hazur Mountains in the north.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The heavily forested Guth Mountains were home to colonies of dangerous blood apes . A lost city of apes was rumored to be hidden somewhere on the forested slopes of the mountain. The presence of the blood apes drew wealthy hunters from Aztul who wished to claim a hide to showoff their status.</p>
<p>Yuan-ti from House Jennestas guarded the eastern slopes of the mountains.</p>
