<p>Rowan Silvercrown was a Lorewarden of Oghma , serving within the Leaves of Learning in the settlement of Highmoon during the midâ€“14 th century DR . She was also a senior monk within the Children of the Passive Voice , leading the contingent of learned protectors of the Oghmanyte library-temple around 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Rowan acted as a mother hen of sorts to the Leaves' clerics , watching closely over them when they ventured out from the temple's walls to nearby towns or out into nature. She constantly chided local members of the Tower Guard , whom she believed did not fulfill their duties with the same vigilance she saw from her fellow monks.</p>
<p>She was a skilled combatant, who could quickly analyze her opponents while evading their attacks, and find just the right time to counter with a deft strike. Like others within her order, Rowan favored the siangham , which they referred to as "Oghma's quill".</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Rowan was born in the Sembian city of Ordulin , but raised in Tegal's Mark , the capital of Tasseldale . She was brought up with a great appreciation for and love of books as well as a hatred for those would attempt to destroy the knowledge they contained. She became a member of the Children at a very young age, and quickly ascended within their ranks.</p>
