<h2>Relationship</h2>
<p>Andrik was the nephew of Zor Faltyn Gos , one of the Blades of Mulmaster. He had an older brother Garwyl Gos and a sister Liticia Gos .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Andrik was always an artist and a painter. Around 1491 DR , when the Blades competed with each other over the arts, Andrik was generously sponsored by his uncle.</p>
<p>However, true success arrived only with his patron Doril Cire , secretly a cultist of the Cult of the Eternal Flame . Thanks to the infusion of elemental fire in his paintings, his works attracted more people. Doril manipulated him into creating a masterpiece that could summon an elemental blast that would destroy the city. At last, however, an adventuring party hired to uncover the truth behind an arson attack on Tiega Gos managed to defeated Doril and stop Andrik. Afterwards, his talent vanished completely, leaving Andrik despondent.</p>
