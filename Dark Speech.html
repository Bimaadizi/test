<p>Dark Speech was the secret language of evil gods , a language of such evil that even demons and devils avoided speaking it, for fear it might consume them. It was extremely difficult for mortals to learn even a single word of it, but each word was full of dread power that could be used to provoke emotions, empower magic, or corrupt physical objects. Fiends found the language easier to learn than mortals did.</p>
