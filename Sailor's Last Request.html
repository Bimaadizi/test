<p>The Sailor's Last Request was a small chapel to Valkur located in Waterdeep during the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple was located in front on the docks, in an old and small warehouse building nested on the corner of Dock Street and Odd Street .</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The small chapel was long since missing a front door, and served as a refuge to impoverished sailors , dove and seagulls . The floor was full of bird droppings, and the whole place smelt of fish and brine.</p>
<p>The place didn't have dedicated clergy members watching over itâ€”just an old retired sailor named Olroy acting as its guard. The altar was an old broken-down table in a corner, full of offerings left over time by worshipers such as seashells, locks of hair, and mementos of strong sentimental value.</p>
<p>The temple to Valkur was often a loud and busy place, used by seafarers as a place to socialize and find new crew members. The deity didn't mind as it valued strength and actions over prayers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before being a temple, the place was a small warehouse used to store salted fish.</p>
