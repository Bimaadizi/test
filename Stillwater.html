<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>A stillwater would not raise a hand in anger no matter what heinous act was being committed against them or in their presence. They did their best to use reason to talk others out of such barbarity.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Stillwaters evolved of their own volition from their general disgust of warfare and combat. Many within Eldath 's clergy looked down upon them as being too pacifistic to be of any use. Stillwaters exuded peace and tranquility wherever they went, believing that it would bring them closer to Eldath.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Stillwaters could speak a soothing word that would magically cease hostilities around them for several minutes. This power could be used several times per day depending on the stillwater's skill. Stillwaters could also cast sleep and forget once per day.</p>
<p>These individuals were prevented from using any magic items or spells that caused harm to others.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Given their extreme pacifistic nature, stillwaters never wore armor nor carried any weapons. They donned long robes or gowns and cloaks . Many chose to wear garlands in their hair of whatever local flower represented peace.</p>
