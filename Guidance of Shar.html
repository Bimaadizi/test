<p>The guidance of Shar was a powerful magical holy symbol of Shar , found in Cormyr in the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The symbol was a simple thin, flat, black steel disk with a purple border about the edge, forming the common symbol of Shar.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The disk had several effects upon its bearer, even without their devotion to Shar. It passively improved the bearer's force of personality, granted them a blurring effect that made them harder to target, and could temporarily blind enemies in melee. Shar's blessing was double-edged, however, and the bearer of the symbol also found themselves being blinded by Shar's darkness at times.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Magistrate Abella Toth granted the symbol as a reward to trustworthy adventurers , who had captured the infamous Sharran priest Dedryk Black for her.</p>
