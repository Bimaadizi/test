<p>During the early 3 rd century DR , the Dancing Dryad had been a favorite meeting place between the Magelords of Athalantar and other moneyed interests, such as the master tailors of the city. In the Year of the Black Flame, 229 DR , when the thieves Farl and Eladar the Dark attempted to steal some Calishite silks in the docks one night, it was because they'd learned of a shipment from a serving girl at the Dancing Dryad, bribing her with four gold pieces for what she'd overheard at work.</p>
