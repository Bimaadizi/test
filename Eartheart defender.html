<p>Eartheart defenders , not to be confused with dwarven defenders , were elite dwarven warriors whose role it was to defend and serve the interests of East Rift , for whose capital the Eartheart defenders were named. With unmovable spirits like the stones that made up dwarven cities, Eartheart defenders stood against the enemies of their race.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Like other dwarven defenders, Eartheart defenders were tied to the dwarven martial traditions and idea of brotherhood. However the defenders from Eartheart saw themselves as being devoted to the entirety of Toril , rather than just the dwarven people. To an Eartheart defender, the stones they walked upon were sacred and worthy of respect and dignity. Those who felt otherwise were the natural enemies of Eartheart.</p>
<p>Eartheart defenders felt a bond amongst one another and saw their comrades as part of a greater whole. They took comfort and drew strength from the fact that each one of them were both important but ultimately expendable, as they had others to carry on their fight after they were gone. The life of an Eartheart defender was like a boulder – while it could be broken in half time and again, it was merely split into many more smaller pebbles, and never truly destroyed.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>To prepare for their role as defenders of Eartheart and Toril, these dwarves underwent intense training regimens. They stubbornly plowed their way through harm with such determination that they were known to sometimes emerge unscathed.</p>
<p>Likewise, they seemed to gain strength in the middle of battle without warning, as though their very will to fight gave them power. The confidence of their more experienced warriors often inspired this same courage and willpower in others, raising their own combat effectiveness.</p>
<p>The prayers learned by Eartheart defenders drew on the divine power of the stones themselves rather than from any particular god . They reflected the very same strength and power for endurance that the Eartheart defenders sought to emulate, allowing them to heal themselves or use "earthsight" see through invisible .</p>
<p>Another prayer was earthsurge , which allow an Eartheart defender to call upon the very power of the stones themselves to create a powerful shockwave that disoriented the defender's foes.</p>
