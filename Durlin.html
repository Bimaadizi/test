<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Durlin left behind a few items that belonged to him, he hid his pair of gloves of courage in a barrel in the room he used to play chess at, and his favorite weapon, the brewmaster's cudgel was used by one of the lizardfolk that found in the Dungeons' ruins.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As the brewmaster, Durlin was maintaining the Shrine of Hanseath in the Halls of Light and was in charge of the city's sacred brewery. His tireless work could still be witnessed all across many levels of the Dwarven Dungeons centuries after his death. Many casks of his holy brews still possessed their magical properties even as late as 1369 DR . In life, Durlin spent countless hours playing Chess with his best friend Drake in the Halls of Light's Chess Room.</p>
<p>In 1369 DR his ghost helped the heroes from Phlan who arrived at Myth Drannor to oppose the Cult of the Dragon 's evil plan. Durlin guided them to his hidden magic items in the Halls of Light.</p>
