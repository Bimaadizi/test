<p>A crawling apocalypse was a rare form of mummy .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These creatures resembled some form of mollusk, such as a giant octopus or giant squid , that had been mummified and outfitted with barbs on their tendrils.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>A crawling apocalypse generally held hazy memories that spanned thousands of years. In particular, the memories of their creators and their lost lives fueled a desire for violence within them.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Their appearance was said to be so horrifying that it could cause some creatures to be temporarily paralyzed with fear.</p>
<p>Like most mummies, these creatures were capable of infecting others with the supernatural disease known as mummy rot . This would be spread by means of injuring victims with the barbs on their tentacles.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These creatures were created in ancient times through necromancy to serve as living weapons for races who once inhabited desert regions. Some continued to persist following the downfall of these races, but encountering them was an extremely rare occurrence as most were trapped in vaults far beneath desert sands.</p>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR , a crawling apocalypse was known to wander outside the ruins of Oreme in Anauroch .</p>
