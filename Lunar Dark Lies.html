<p>Lunar Dark Lies was a Sharran text, penned in or before the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>Lunar Dark Lies was a work of propaganda targeting worshipers of Sehanine Moonbow , an elvish deity, in favor of Shar . The book claimed that Sehanine whispered nothing but lies to her followers, without offering any solutions to the follower's struggles and plights, calling the deity as cold as "lunar marina, seas of empty pale dust." The book countered that with painting the dark goddess Shar as a truthspeaker and a deity of warmth, despite being a nihilistic deity of loss. "The sick-at-heart will find only succor and blessings in the embrace of She who understands them best."</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a copy of Lunar Dark Lies was found within the library of the Cloister of Sombre Embrace , a secret Sharran sect underneath the Lower City of Baldur's Gate and available from the House of Grief above it.</p>
