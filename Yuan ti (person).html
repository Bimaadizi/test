<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR , Yuan accompanied his father and Prince Tang on an expedition into the nameless swamp near the Ginger Palace, in order to slay the dracolich Hethcypressarvil . During the journey along the waters of the swamp, Tang ordered the execution of General Fui on grounds of insubordination, which was inadvertently brought on by the consumption of lasal leaves. Not recognizing Yuan at first, Tang directed the young officer to slay his own father. When Yuan hesitated, Fui himself ordered his son to follow the prince's commands, as they were considered wholly unquestionable. Yuan carried out the task and continued to follow the prince for the rest of the mission.</p>
<p>The rest of the expedition just as disastrous, as all of the Shou soldiers were slain and and their corpses scattered across the swamp. Yuan's exact fate was unknown.</p>
