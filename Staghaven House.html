<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the aftermath of the Council of the Dragon and ensuing massacre on late Mirtul of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Broryn Windstag , who had remained at home for the event, had Irlin Stonestable as a guest when his servant Aereld informed him of the chaos in the wake of the killing. Though he felt it may have been exaggerated, a soon-arriving Sacrast Handragon confirmed Aereld and explained the situation was even more dire.</p>
<p>Other guests arriving in that day included Traevyn Illance , who came to recruit the heirs into a plot to mind-control the King; Osbur , with a warning for the young Windstag, and a desperate Marlin Stormserpent , fearing an unknown mind-controller, actually the vampire archmage Manshoon . Illance and Marlin plotted for a way to leverage Marlin Stormserpent's blueflame ghosts to gain the King's trust.</p>
<p>Lord Windstag and all his servants were murdered shortly after by an unknown, sorcerous assailant, who cast a spell on the corpses that drove insane anyone who used magic to interrogate them.</p>
