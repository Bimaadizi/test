<p>The so-called luminous gloves were enchanted gauntlets that possessed illuminating capabilities, created sometime long before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The gauntlets' fingertips were made of exposed fabric that produced a gaudy glow. The wearer of the gloves gained slightly boosted physical prowess, and if they could cast spells that dealt radiant energy damage, the gauntlets' magic illuminated the targets with a radiant orb for six seconds, making them vulnerable and visible.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a pair of luminous gloves could be found in a chest among spoils and ruins of the battlefield on the outskirts of Reithwin , left behind from the final battle between the Harper forces and the cultists of General Ketheric Thorm in the late 14 th century DR.</p>
