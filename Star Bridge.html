<p>The Star Bridge , originally named the Karlyn Bridge , was an ancient dwarven bridge that crossed the Vudlur river in eastern Amn .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The bridge carried the Eshpurta Road over the Vudlur, positioned halfway between Keczulla to the west and the Axe Bridge to the east.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Star Bridge was a massive stone structure that spanned the widest possible floodheight of the Vudlur, of identical design to the nearby Axe Bridge. It was built of highly resilient stonework, such that by the 14 th century DR it bore only the slightest traces of wear and tear, mostly from recent heavy cart traffic. It was decorated with the heavily faded runes for Karlyn Bridge on the railing stones, with the star symbol granting it the later name.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The bridge was built around −5500 DR by the dwarves of the High Shanataran realm of Korolnor as part of their great network of surface projects. It was inscribed with the name Karlyn Bridge, in honor of the warrior Karlyn .</p>
<p>Long after the fall of Shanatar, humans from Calimshan settled the region and discovered the twin bridges. With little dwarf artifice to compare it to, the true origins of the Karlyn bridge went unknown despite being widely used by travelers. Only the careful examination by scholars and dwarves of the bridges' eroded runes eventually revealed the fact that the bridges had originated in the ancient dwarven age of Shanatar .</p>
