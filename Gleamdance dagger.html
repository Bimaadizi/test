<p>Gleamdance dagger was an enchanted dagger , created using a pair of pixie wings with the wings' shimmering tracings visible day and night, shining the brightest in Selûne 's light.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Gleamdance dagger's +2 enchantment guided the wielder's hand towards the target and increased the blade's damage, making it useful when wielding against creatures unaffected by non-magical weapons. The dagger always glowed when it was held in a person's hand, illuminating the area of 20 feet (6.1 meters) around it. When the dagger was wielded in one's off-hand, it magically increased the wielder's defenses similarly to a +1 armor enchantment.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a Gleamdance dagger was wielded by the shady gnome named Farlin , a thug member of the Guild of Baldur's Gate , during its conflict with the Stone Lord 's gang.</p>
