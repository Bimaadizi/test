<p>Malatran sign language was a large family of distinct non-verbal languages used by the various races of the Malatran Plateau . Each tribe on the Plateau had their own sign language , which were distinct enough from one another that mixing them could not be done.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The various sign languages used by tribes on the Malatran Plateau developed over time from the necessity of hunters needing a way to communicate to one another without alerting their prey. In an effort to better facilitate communication, one form of sign language on the Plateau was developed by the lacerials and taught to a select few tribes.</p>
