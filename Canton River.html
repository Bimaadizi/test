<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Mythallar Era , orcs roamed the Rampant Peaks and the area around Xinlenal. The orc had sacked caravans and killed people of Ioulaum's enclave, and so the archwizard wished to discover the location of these orcs . After many years of tracking them down, his officials finally found that the orcs inhabited the knolls of the Canton River's headwaters. It was then that Ioulaum began his Excursion into Extinction campaign to slay every last orc, and his troops headed towards the source of the river.</p>
<p>During the later part of the the 30 th century NY , parts of the waterway began to descend deep into the earth. After the fall of Netheril, the river had essentially disappeared.</p>
