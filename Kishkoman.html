<p>A kishkoman , or whistle-knife was a unique weapon found in the Cold Lands .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A kishkoman looked like a small animal horn only slightly longer than a child's hand. The broader base of the horn served as the handle and was perforated with small holes. When blown, the kishkoman emitted a high-pitched sound that only elves could hear. This sound was used to call for aid to any within hearing range of the whistle.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These items were made from the horn of a small swiftstag buck. Mothers typically gave them to children when they reached an age where they could go off on their own.</p>
