<p>Architect genies , also called builder genies , were special tasked genies who were common in the Great Dismal Delve . They were also bound by sha'irs in Zakhara to serve princes and lords as architects and builders. These genies were once dao but changed over time to suit their tasks.</p>
<p>The mystical stories told of cities springing up overnight were a direct result of the power of the architect genies.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These genies were bald and muscular. They usually had a brand of ownership on their hand or forehead.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Architects could use the following spell-like abilities: minor creation , vacancy , warp wood , stone shape , stone tell , and passwall . Once per month they could use a wish related to building.</p>
<p>These genies were masters at finding the weak points of any structure, making them deadly during a siege.</p>
<p>Architects would only resort to combat as a final option, preferring to let others fight instead. These genies would defend their worksite if commanded, but would rarely fight beyond its walls.</p>
<h2>Habitat/Society</h2>
<p>Their work was an architect's reason for living; their way to be remembered for all time.</p>
<p>Buildings constructed by these genies cost four times as much were twice as strong as normal buildings and lasted for twice as long.</p>
<p>They could replicate the style of any building that they have seen and been able to study for one day.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>These genies were slaves to the dao and resented them.</p>
