<h2>History</h2>
<p>Karajah became famous for remaining the undefeated gladiator for a decade while wearing nothing by a leather armor and armed with spiked gauntlets . It was believed that Karajah was impervious to his opponents' attacks until it was discovered that his armor possessed a powerful enchantment . This revelation angered the pit-fighting spectators, and they overpowered Karajah and threw him into a pit with a well-armed ogre who broke every bone in the fighter's body while the armor itself remained undamaged.
