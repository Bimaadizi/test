<h2>History</h2>
<p>For many years, Duke Raymond of Delthuntle and Duke Edwall Dest of Spandeliyon had a fierce rivalry with one another. After agreeing to partake in an archery contest with his rival, Duke Edwall orchestrated the theft of Dead Shot from Duke Raymond.</p>
<p>On the day of the contest, Edwall shot the bow at the head of a humanoid target, that in fact had been enchanted at Duke Raymond's behest. Just as the head of the target was torn asunder by the bow's arrow , so too did the head of Duke Edwall.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Dead Shot came into the possession of a hobgoblin Hakt under the employ of the bandit-leader Tazok .</p>
