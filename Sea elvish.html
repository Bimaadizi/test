<p>Sea elvish , sometimes referred to as aquatic elvish or sea elven , was a distinct dialect of the Elven language spoken by sea elves .</p>
<h2>Speakers</h2>
<p>Beyond the sea elves themselves, this dialect was commonly spoken by Asrai , water sprites of the Upper Planes , and malenti . And though they could not speak it themselves, the dialect was comprehensible to some dolphins and whales .</p>
<p>Some of the individual specialty priests of aquatic deities were known to learn various other aquatic languages, such as Sea Elvish. These included the waveservants of Umberlee and the waterwalkers of Istishia .</p>
<h2>Phonology</h2>
<p>While spoken Sea Elvish was quite recognizable as being related to Elvish, it was distinct enough to make the dialect not immediately understandable by the other elven races, which could result in momentary language barriers. However, like other Elvish dialects, most of it could usually be understood by the other elven subraces. The dialect's oddly accented nature was due in part to borrowing many inflections and words from Aquan , the language of elemental water . It also incorporated interspersion of clicks, squeals, and whistles, similar to those used in the language of dolphins .</p>
<h2>Script</h2>
<p>Just like standard Elvish, Sea Elvish used the Espruar alphabet. It had a distinctive style to it, which displayed influences from Aquan.</p>
<h2>Derivative Languages</h2>
<h2>Magic</h2>
<p>The spell aura of the sea would automatically translate any spoken Sea Elvish into Common for those also standing within the aura.</p>
