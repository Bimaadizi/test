<p>Ulraunt was the Keeper of the Tomes of Candlekeep as early as 1368 DR . He was known to be a proud and haughty wizard .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ulraunt's nickname among the library's acolytes, "the Old Buzzard", was given to him due to his facial features - large nose, dark eyes, hawk 's gaze, and sharp tongue. The unflattering name eventually became quite common among many residents of the Sword Coast.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Ulraunt is reputed to carry a staff of office with him that has the powers of a staff of the magi , in addition to more potent powers. This staff of office also has a token built into it known as a glow stave . He owned a wand of sleep and wore a mage robe of fire resistance circa 1368 DR .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Ulraunt was a competent wizard and had numerous spells scribed in his spellbook , including improved invisibility , flame arrow , lightning bolt , Aganazzar's scorcher , chromatic orb , among others.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Tethtoril , the First Reader of Candlekeep circa 1372 DR was often mistaken for Ulraunt by visitors because of his scholarly attitude, demeanor, bearing, and intelligence. Ulraunt was embittered at Tethtoril for that.</p>
<p>Ulraunt's personal life was filled with rumors and obfuscations. Folk claimed that he was involved with young ladies of several Waterdhavian and Tethyrian noble houses in his youth. Rumors that floated circa 1368 DR connected Ulraunt to haughty elven ladies from Evermeet .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Ulraunt ordered all petitioners who sought access to the vast libraries of Candlekeep to share at least one eveningfeast, seating to the mage's left side and diligently entertain the Keeper of the Tomes by answering his questions.</p>
<p>Reportedly, Ulraunt's expansive collection of spell eclipsed that of most spellcasters in Faerûn. Some people claimed that the old wizard practiced his spellcraft regularly in his personal chamber and in depths of Candlekeep's catacombs and caverns. His overall goals remain unknown to most, apart from the wizard's desire to make Candlekeep the center of scholarly studies and a political power.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime after 712 DR , then young Ulraunt got his hands on a supremely rare book, Lore of Lurue —a tome penned by Ecamane Truesilver , the first High Mage of Silverymoon . Young traveling monk used this rare opportunity to gain access to Candlekeep, eventually becoming its Keeper of the Tomes.</p>
<p>In 1368 DR, entry to Candlekeep was allowed only to those to those who were able to contribute a tome of great knowledge by the orders Ulraunt. No-one was exempt to these sanctions, even inhabitants of the library, such as Abdel Adrian .</p>
<p>In 1370 DR , Manshoon Prime , the eldest of the Manshoon clones forged a secrecy alliance with Ulraunt after providing him with seven extremely rare volumes, including Pharaudo's Tome in exchange for asylum.</p>
<p>As of 1372 DR , Ulraunt remained the Keeper of the Tomes. Following the apotheosis of mortals Mystra and Cyric , Ulraunt was tempted by the mad god but Tethtoril managed to keep the haughty wizards out of following Cyric or other dark powers. In 1375 DR , Ulraunt greeted and dined with the adventurers who opposed the returned Netherese enclave - Thultanthar . The frugal dinner included thin soup , stale bread , boiled vegetables, and diluted wine . The adventurers were pelted with questions about their quest, their goals, and what they were hoping to find among the endless bookshelves of Candlekeep.</p>
