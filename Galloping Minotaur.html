<p>Galloping Minotaur was an inn in the city of Waterdeep that was widely known and frequented by merchants and travelers.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Galloping Minotaur's main building stood on Copper Street , while its secondary building stood in an alley block behind it, both in the North Ward of the city.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>This building complex consisted of two buildings. The original inn, plus an adjacent building, and a converted warehouse. The two adjacent buildings were two stories tall, while the warehouse stood three stories tall,</p>
<h3>Interior</h3>
<p>The first floor of the main inn housed a lobby, an open lounge area used by most guests, and four private meeting rooms that were for rent. Paneled walls in these private rooms hid secret passages that the servants traveled in, using them to access the rooms whenever they were summoned by the guests tugging on a pull- bell .</p>
<p>The bottom story of the converted warehouse served as a stables, its second floor contained the inn's cheaper rental rooms, and its top floor was used as housing by the staff.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The innkeeper regularly paid youths a few copper pieces to arrive every hour or so and bellow out the latest news.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR , facing overwhelming success as a stop for merchants, the Galloping Minotaur decided to expand its operations by buying out an adjacent storefront and a warehouse that was located behind the inn.</p>
<p>By the 1360s DR , when Volothamp Geddarm came to visit the establishment he found that the quality of service in the Galloping Minotaur was slipping and that it was overpriced. He reasoned that the inn was growing complacent and reliant on the reputation it had built over the years prior to maintain a steady flow of business.</p>
