<p>Ardeep was a realm of moon elves founded during the First Flowering , around −23,600 DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The realm of Ardeep encompassed the area later known as the Ardeep Forest as well as lands north of the River Delimbiyr .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ardeep was a vassal state of Shantel Othreier at the beginning of the Crown Wars . At the conclusion of the Third Crown War in −10,600 DR , Shantel Othreier was conquered by the Vyshaantar Empire of Aryvandaar . Ardeep continued to battle against the forces of Aryvandaar until it was conquered in −10,460 DR . It took the next hundred years for Aryvandaar to gain complete control and two of Ardeep's rulers were slain: Ilitharath and his grandson, Tarosspur .</p>
<p>After Shantel Othreier was conquered by the Vyshaantar Empire , it was taken as a vassal realm of the Empire. When the Vyshaan were dissolved, Ardeep joined with Illefarn in −9000 DR . When Aelinthaldaar was razed by its own people in −1100 DR , Illefarn split into three fragmented states of which Ardeep was one and became independent for the first time in many millenia.</p>
<p>Alliances were made with the dwarves of Dardath , the humans of Delimbiyran , the gnomes of Dolblunde and the halflings of Secomber and together they formed Phalorm in the Year of Trials Arcane, 523 DR . . Phalorm eventually fell in the Year of the Lamia's Kiss, 615 DR , and was replaced by the Kingdom of Man . Many of the elves of Ardeep left for Evermeet at that time and most of those that remained followed in the Year of Moonfall, 1344 DR .</p>
