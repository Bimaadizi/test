<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was the second son of Inrath Mirandor III , brother of Inrath IV , and stepbrother of Doraven "the Bloody" .</p>
<p>His only son, Ellarath served as his successor.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time during or before the Year of the Great Dwarven Gate, 162 DR , Pendarn returned to his native Impiltur from Cormyr , following the death of his elder brother Inrath IV. His return home was largely in response to the bloody coup initiated by their stepbrother, Doraven , who had slain Inrath and seized the throne of Impiltur for himself. Pendarn slew Doraven in turn, and reclaimed the monarchy in his brother's name.</p>
<p>Pendarn ruled Impiltur for over a decade and a half, until the Year of the Jealous Spouse, 178 DR .</p>
