<p>White saluqi were a rare breed of saluqi found only in the Mountains of Forgotten Dreams in the High Desert of west Zakhara .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As their name implied, this breed of saluqi had short white fur. This was a stark contrast to the darker black fur of the common saluqi. They usually stood shorter than a man's knee. They had stubby tails and sharp teeth.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>White saluqi were said to be as fast as gazelles and, despite their small size, as strong as a mule . Their endurance allowed them to chase rabbits until their prey dropped from exhaustion. White saluqis were fierce when they needed to be, often standing their ground against much larger animals.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Because of their unique appearance and hunting skills, white saluqi were prized by both sportsmen and collectors. They made loyal companions if cared for as a pet. A white saluqi could be purchased from a trader for 50 dinars in Tajar .</p>
