<p>Kingsley Harp was a playwright and a director who rose to prominence seemingly overnight sometime in or before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Kingsley's career was nothing but a collection of failures and rejections even from the notorious chapbook tabloid of Baldur's Gate – Baldur's Bash . However, soon after, the play called A Pleasurable Deal gained fame and infamy for its profane contents. Kingsley Harp was its creator and the first-time director. Subsequently, the play was banned in a number of cities across Faerûn . Mr. Kingsley Harp gave an interview that was titled A Pleasurable Deal: The Shocking Truth when it hit print. In the interview, he was asked about the inspiration for the play's plot about a tiefling whose wife had left him for another lover, and as a result, he struck a deal with a cambion . When Kingsley was asked why anyone would strike a deal with such creatures, he stated that everyone wanted something, and cambions knew people better than they knew themselves. The interview was abruptly ended when the playwright was asked what his deal with a cambion was.</p>
