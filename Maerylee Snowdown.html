<p>Maerylee Snowdown was a spectral harpist in Myth Drannor .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Maerylee, in life, was a half-elf bard who settled in Myth Drannor after the raising of the mythal and joined the original Harpers at Twilight .</p>
<p>She died at one point, but thanks to the mythal somehow rose again as a strange kind of undead ghost .</p>
<p>From then on, Maerylee helped all good-oriented adventurers, especially fellow Harpers or bards, who ventured inside the city by directing them with the sound of her harp.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , a Harper was captured by a doomsphere , so Maerylee used her harp to call an adventuring party to free the captive Harper.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As in life, Maerylee always sung at sunset. She couldn't touch material objects so she used her harping to help the adventurers.</p>
