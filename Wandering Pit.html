<p>The Wandering Pit of Vaasa , often referred to simply as the Pit , was a mysterious entity which terrorized Vaasa in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Under normal circumstances, the Pit was completely hidden and virtually undetectable as it could perfectly camouflage into almost any terrain, whether grassy, muddy, or rocky. However, when it attacked, it opened suddenly as a 20‑foot-wide (6.1‑meter) and 10‑foot-deep (3‑meter) hole filled with spikes.</p>
<p>It was unclear whether the Pit was a creature, some kind of animate trap , or an amalgamation of multiple things.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Pit roved all across Vaasa, attacking unsuspecting victims everywhere from the Sunderland and the Galena Mountains in the east to the Bottomless Bogs in the west. It would appear without warning beneath the feet of its victims, snap open suddenly and swallow them, and then just as suddenly spring shut with its prey inside. It would then vanish completely.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Pit, or something similar to it, was responsible for swallowing a delegation of Red Wizards who attempted to gain an audience with Zhengyi the Witch-King in the mid–14 th century DR.</p>
<p>The Wandering Pit gained its name and notoriety when it began attaching folk across Vaasa in the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR . Since it appeared shortly after the defeat of Zhengyi and the collapse of his Castle Perilous , many believed that it was some abomination or defense mechanism that had escaped from the castle. It was known to target travelers, even snatching up a rider along with their horse . In one notable case, a party of adventurers searched desperately for the Pit after they saw it snatch one of their members, but even digging 8 feet (2.4 meters) deep revealed no sign of the thing. The Pit further became a menace to the dwarves of Hillsafar Hall , who placed a 500 gold piece bounty on it.</p>
