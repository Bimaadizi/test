<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Jan Jansen and Kylie Jansen were Furnbottom's nephew and niece.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Kylie Jansen reminisced about her uncle's heroic adventuring career. She liked to tell a story about how handsome old Furnbottom looked in his shiny polished golden heavy armor and the sword risen high. However, the gnome's career ended when a hungry griffon got attracted to the Furnbottom's shine and swooped down from the sky at him like a gnome on a platter of turnips. Furnbottom fought valiantly on the way down.</p>
