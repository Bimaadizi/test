<p>Crosswinds Keep was a fortified town in the Elserryn Cluster , within the Astral Plane .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The keep was built on the head of a dead god. A number of houses were built around the keep, alongside a guard post and stables.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The Stalwart Lions banned entry to githyanki , githzerai , illithids , yugoloths , devils and demons . They also gave permission to settle for those who wanted to build on their territory.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Crosswinds Keep proper was a stop for travelers, an outpost for foes of the gith, and otherwise a safe haven.</p>
<p>Meals cost 5 sp for a common meal and 7 sp for a good meal. A room for a night cost 3 gp . A private dining room could also be rented for 7 gp, with 15 gp for every diner. The keep also boasted a library and a shop for common supplies, though they had a 50% markup. New supplies were brought weekly by a servant using plane shift to make purchases in Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The keep's walls were 30 feet tall and 15 feet thick at the base. A single portcullis granted access across the walls. An orb of isolation restricted entry to a single point within the keep's territory, making it impossible to enter anywhere else.</p>
<p>To gain entry, one would have to swear to leave any regional conflicts outside the keep. In spite of this rule, conflict was common both around and within the keep; the Stalwart Lions protected the place against attack, and were often joined by the patrons.</p>
<p>To counter githyanki raiders from nearly Vala'Koth , the Stalwart Lions employed five astral squidships to patrol the area in a mile around the keep. Lookouts were often posted on astral balloons , wearing goggles of astral seeing . Inhabitants of the keep also had learned to fear fazes .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Crosswinds Keep was built by the Stalwart Lions at some point between 922 DR and 1372 DR , after Bran Oakenshire pledged his love to Moala Addrell ; they departed for the Astral, looking for a place where Bran's lifespan would not lag behind Moala's. After founding the keep, they were often harried by githyanki, but the raiders were not capable of extracting a toll from the keep or the travelers.</p>
<p>The Stalwart Lions later found catacombs excavated in the rock, which they cleared of beings from the Lower Planes. At some point, they purchased a squid ship retrieved from The Pyre by a visitor to the Keep, and commissioned copies of it, managing a fleet of five more as of 1372 DR By that year, the original ship had disappeared.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The masters of Crosswinds Keep were not aware the catacombs had been excavated by devils.</p>
