<p>Raumark was an Archwizard of Hlondath , who led the southern migration that founded Halruaa .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The man's appearance was only known to Elminster Aumar , and even then, through spell-shared memories not his own.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He could cast a spell that created a whorl of disintegrating energy.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Raumark had grown dissatisfied with the attitude of his fellow arcanists in Netheril , and planned on an exodus even before the Fall.</p>
<p>In the Year of Sundered Webs, −339 DR , shortly after the Fall of Netheril , Raumark was involved in the founding of Hlondath , where he hoped to make a stand against the phaerimm .</p>
<p>Rather than stay, however, he led a great flight of skyships , including not only fellow arcanists but also their households, and so a majority of Low Netherese, south to a secluded, broad valley that would later become Halruaa . Deliberately trying to reduce the influence of fallen Netheril, he learned the language of the locals, rather than speak Netherese. He also prepared his people for a fight with the pursuing phaerimm he expected.</p>
<p>In a vision granted to him by Mystra in Year of the Awakening Wyrm, 767 DR , Elminster learned that Raumark had been in a hall of white pillars, where he cast and then jumped into a spell-created whorl of disintegration.</p>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>The library of Raumark was named after him.</p>
