<p>Haragh Mnistlyn was an apprentice Zhentarim wizard in High Dale .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1358 DR , Haragh was a member of the secret Zhent occupation army in High Dale. He was acting as gatekeeper when he noticed Elminster Aumar and Sharantyr . They looked to be suspicious individuals in his eyes so he cast a read mind spell. However, he was instead surrounded by well-trodden grass—a symptom of the Time of Troubles . Haragh remained totally shocked while Elminster subtly made jokes at him.</p>
<p>When later an insurrection started against the Zhents, Haragh confronted Elminster and Sharantyr inside the High Castle but they managed to kill him.</p>
