<p>The halfling language , which was properly called Luiric (or Lurienal ), was a language spoken by the halflings of Luiren . Since halflings were so adaptive by nature, the vast majority of halflings outside of Luiren had abandoned their native tongue and spoke Common or other human languages instead.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Halflings had a strong oral history, but they were loath to share their language with others, and anything that they did write down more often than not used Common. It couldn't be categorized as a secret language, but it was rare to see or hear for non-halflings.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Common surnames in the hin tongue included Aumble Bramblefoot, Dardragon, Hardingdale, Merrymar, and Starnhap. Male halflings had given names such as Blazanar, Corkaury, Dalabrac, Halandar, Ombert, Roberc, Thiraury, or Wilimac. Females might be named Aloniira, Calathra, Deldiira, Melinden, Olpara, Rosinden, Tara, or Weninda.</p>
