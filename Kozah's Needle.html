<p>Kozah's Needle was a magic staff named after an ancient god of lightning .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kozah's Needle was 8 feet (2.4 meters) long. It could be folded into a 4‑foot-long (1.2‑meter) walking stick, but also transformed into a triple bar with a 4‑foot (1.2‑meter) center bar, joined to a 2‑foot (0.61‑meter) bar on each end joined to the center with chains (like a dire threshing flail ), or split in half to form a pair of flails of two 2‑foot (0.61‑meter) bars joined with chains.</p>
<p>Kozah's Needle built up an electric charge as it was used, and it could unleash electricity, even channeling it through an opponent's metal weapon. In addition, if charged enough, it could emit a large blast of lightning that could burn a hole into an opponent and lay them low. It was also discovered by accident that it could absorb electric magic to charge it.</p>
