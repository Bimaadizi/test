<p>Raider G'r'ath was one of the githyanki who guarded Crèche Y'llek 's the hatchery on Toril in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>G'r'ath had typical skin and spot coloration of her kin. She had high brown hair and had painted or tattooed eyes and eyebrows. She wore almost no armor, apart from a pauldron and bracers of githyanki design. As a Raider, G'r'ath was armed with a heavy crossbow .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Raider G'r'ath, along with other gith of what would become Crèche Y'llek, attacked and claimed the Rosymorn Monastery of Lathander in the Western Heartlands sometime before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . Soon after, the function of Crèche was changed as the githyanki war against the mind flayers in Faerûn shifted in balance. During that time, G'r'ath was placed to stand guard in the Crèche's hatchery and its youths' caretaker Varsh Ko'kuu . Raider G'r'ath showed disdain for any non-gith istik if they were allowed access to Crèche Y'llek.</p>
