<p>Arbor Square was a large public plaza roughly at the center of Halarahh in the wizard nation of Halruaa .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Arbor Square stood at the center of the loop formed by the Promenade . To the west from it stood the grand Zalathorm's Palace and immediately to the south â€“ the Dockside Square .</p>
<p>The plaza was a beautiful and spacious square built out of green and pink stone. The plaza was decorated with intricate pink grape vine-shaded iron trellises and arches. Numerous chairs, benches, and small tables were placed all around the Arbor Square, offering passers-by rest in the shade of the hot southern sun. The air around the square was filled with sweet fragrances of grapes, overripe oranges , and savory aromas of the open-air market, mixed with the fresh smell of the Great Sea .</p>
<p>The center of the Arbor Square held a stage, a risen platform, used by self-absorbed orators, town criers, and musicians, as well as occasional display of wizardly magic.</p>
