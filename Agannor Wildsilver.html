<p>Agannor Wildsilver was a human fighter and member of the Knights of Myth Drannor in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Agannor was a tall and handsome man with blonde hair. A charmer, he carried himself with easy grins.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was known for his bold nature and had a quick temper, which often led him to act before thinking through the consequences.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was a friend of Beyard "Bey" Freemantle .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the earliest days of the Knights of Myth Drannor in the Year of the Spur, 1348 DR , he and his friend Bey joined the adventuring group that would be known as the Knights of Myth Drannor while at the The Moon and Stars tavern in Waymoot .</p>
<p>During his time with the Knights, Agannor participated in exploring the Haunted Halls in Eveningstar, where he displayed his typical impulsive behavior, charging into dangerous situations without proper caution. This tendency put him at odds with the more careful Pennae , leading to friction within the group.</p>
<p>He and Bey ultimately betrayed the Knights when a Zhentarim mage implanted them with mindworms . Under this influence, they murdered Taeriana and Kestra, the two coinlasses who had unwittingly infected them with the mindworms.</p>
<p>They soon after killed their fellow Knight, Martess Ilmra , when she discovered their deeds.</p>
<p>Agannor met his end later that day while attempting to reach the Zhentarim mage Whisper through a portal, dying when Whisper's magical guardians—a chuul , ettin , and umber hulk —were turned against him. He died alongside Bey and a Zhentarim agent who had been leading them.</p>
