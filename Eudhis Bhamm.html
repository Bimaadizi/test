<p>Eudhis Bhamm was a human male herbalist and the proprietor of Bhamm's Herbs in Eshpurta , Amn , in the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR through at least early 1370 DR, the Year of the Tankard . He had a surly disposition and was quick on the rejoinder. He was usually nervous and with good reason: he was a wizard in a land that had nearly outlawed wizardry. With much persuasion, he could be convinced to allow potential customers into his "compounding room" where he had an almost complete stock of spell components for every occasionâ€”at double the usual price.</p>
