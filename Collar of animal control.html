<p>Collars of animal control were enchanted animal collars that allowed one to force animals to obey mental commands.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A collar of animal control was made of a thick leather, covered in markings and runes sacred to the deity Malar . Each collar bore a miniature iron chain .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These collars could be resized to fit around the neck of any animal. Once successfully put on an animal, the miniature chain on a collar of animal control would detach and those who held it would have control over the animal in a manner similar to the spell dominate animal . However, this mental link would end if the matching chain was not being held or if the animal was more than 10 feet (3 meters) away from the wielder. Additionally, if given a command that was obviously self-destructive, an animal might try to fight back against the command, potentially breaking the enchantment.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid–14 th century DR , Kazok a member of the Malarite organization Furious Hunt , terrorized the town of Berlingford in the Silver Marches with packs of wild dogs and wolves that he and his thugs commanded with collars of animal control . This domination of the local wolves angered the awakened wolf Felinal , whose master had been kidnapped by Kazok, but it was reluctant to attack the Malarites lest it fall victim to their collars of animal control .</p>
