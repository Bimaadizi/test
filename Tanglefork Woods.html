<p>The Tanglefork Woods was a small forest in the Grayvale .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It lay at the southwestern fringe of the great High Forest , between it and the River Delimbiyr and the Delimbiyr Road and just east of the Heartblood River where it joined the Delimbiyr.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The soil here was as dark as midnight, even half a century after the Battle of Tanglefork.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Battle of Tanglefork was fought here in the Year of the Wandering Wyrm, 1317 DR , when the rebel leader Nanathlor Greysword , the Green Regent of Mielikki , led his ragtag band against the mercenaries of Pasuuk Rensha , the then ruler of Loudwater. To aid her champion, Mielikki awakened the trees and set them to attack Pasuuk's forces, and he in turn summoned a coven of devils . But they were defeated and the corpses of Pasuuk and his fiendish allies were scattered like filth, blackening the soil of Tanglefork Woods with their evil.</p>
<p>In the summer of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Hekkut the Molted and his goblin bandits, all working for the Hark , established a hidden lair somewhere near the Tangleforks. From there, they attacked travelers passing along a lightly wooded stretch of the Delimbiyr Road just near the Tanglefork campsite and a wooded knoll. Late one afternoon in Eleasias , Skar , Gvrag , and others caught and tortured Blaz Merrymar there, before adventurers intervened.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>A campsite in the woods was commonly used by travelers between Loudwater and Shining Falls .</p>
<p>A river cave on the banks of the Heartblood River where it passed through a winding chasm near the Tangleforks was used as a base by Hekkut the Molted and his goblin bandits. Its walls were hard-packed sand, clay, and stone, with some lashed logs to provide crude supports to this dank, dark place. Deathsbreath mushrooms grew in abundance in one cave and a family of lightning rats made their lair outside and served as guardians. A few holes in the cliff-face let goblin crossbowmen watch over and shoot at anyone approaching via the river, which the goblins used a raft to traverse. In their storeroom, they kept their loot before transporting it back to the Dungeon of the Hark . Hekkut's own lair held a shrine to his rodent deity and and a hole leading to an Underdark passage ominously called the Flayers' Corridors .</p>
<p>In a nearby stand of blueleaf trees, the goblins maintained a grisly carcass-filled pitâ€”the product of both cooking large meals and conducting rites and sacrifices to Maglubiyet . As well as deer and other animals, it included a few humans , a pair of orcs , a lone ogre who had blundered into their base before being killed, the dozen goblins it slew, and several halflings , likely the sons and nephews of Blaz Merrymar. An older such hole was the trapped secret passage into a tunnel leading toward their base.</p>
