<p>Wulgreth of Netheril was a rebellious Netherese arcanist who was transformed into a lich .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Wulgreth was a renegade arcanist dwelling in the High Forest when, in 3451 NY (−408 DR) , the famous arcanist Karsus was experimenting with the newly discovered heavy magic . When one experiment with the Volhm's drain spell threatened to collapse the whole Eileanar enclave, Karsus hurled the heavy magic over the side and into the High Forest. Living nearby the landing site, Wulgreth's very life energy was drained into the heavy magic , causing him to be transformed into a lich.</p>
<p>In 3162 NY (−697 DR) , Wulgreth was defeated in battle by Sunbright Steelshanks and Knucklebones while they were his prisoners after escaping a mock battle between Karsus and Ioulaum .</p>
<p>As an act of petty revenge on Karsus, despite him being already dead following Karsus's Folly , Wulgreth began to sew dissension throughout the Cult of Karse in the city of Karse . Eventually, the divisions tore the city apart, leading to its destruction in Year of Foul Awakenings, −286 DR , little more than a decade after its founding. After it was abandoned, the lich Wulgreth made his home in the newly formed temple ruins to ensure the city would never be rebuilt. It was later widely believed Wulgreth had destroyed the city himself, years earlier in Year of Scorched Skulls, −326 DR , to have revenge against Karsus.</p>
<p>At some point, Wulgreth transformed from a lich into a demilich .</p>
<p>On Nightal 30 , in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , the Evereskan tomb guardian Galaeron Nihmedu , and his "allies" Melegaunt Tanthul and Vala Thorsdotter , traveled to Karse Butte in search of the Karsestone . There they managed to destroy Wulgreth of Netheril, once and for all.</p>
