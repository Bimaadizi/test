<p>The book of Dellanil Quil'quien was an ancient tome containing the writings of Dellanil Quil'quien , an elf king of Shilmista and one of the forest's legendary heroes.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was bound in black leather and inscribed with the high elven runes for 'D', 'Q', 'q'. The tome was locked by a snap.</p>
<p>The Dellanil Quil'quien contained arcane writings, using old elven symbols.</p>
<p>There was an account of how King Dellanil Quil'quien awakened the trees of Shilmista and how the elves crushed an invading force of goblins with the help of the trees. This was also, not a simple spell, but a calling to awaken the powers of the forest.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Cadderly Bonaduce found the tome in a deserted cave in the Daoine Dune in the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR . A dream, or more a vision finally helped Cadderly to understand and translate the ancient writings.</p>
<p>Cadderly and Elbereth , the elven prince of Shilmista, recited the words of the summons at Sildritch Trea and awakened a couple of ancient oaks to help conquer the orcish , goblinoid , and giant forces of the ogrillon Ragnor and free Shilmista once again.</p>
