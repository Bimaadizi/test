<p>The wands of earth and stone or, after 1372 DR , staffs of earth and stone , were wands or staffs tipped with fist-sized chunks of mineral, often emeralds , smoldering with power.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Before 1372 DR , the long wands or short staves came in two varieties, normal and powerful . The normal versions could cast the spells dig , passwall , and move earth , while powerful ones could cast the additional spells of transmute rock to mud and transmute mud to rock , colloquially known as transmute rock . The powerful version became increasingly rarer after 1372 DR , but unlike wands the wielder could push more power through the staff.</p>
<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
