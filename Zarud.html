<p>Zarud was the Zhentarim representative among the Bedine people of Anauroch during the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>His face featured many scars and a smooth and comely moustache.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>While he did not speak Midani , his servant was capable of casting spells that allowed him to understand and communicate with those who did.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Zarud worked under the lead of Yhekal , a skilled Zhentarim mage , who posed as his manservant.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He served as a figurehead for the Zhentilar army in the desert of Anauroch. The true power was held by the Zhentarim spellcaster Yhekal and his superiors.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , Zarud was assigned to Anauroch to act as liaison between the Bedine and Zhents. Along with Yhekal, Zarud plotted a large attack in order to enslave the Bedine people. The pair managed to gain magic control over Sheikh Sabkhat of the Mtair Dhafir tribe. While on the face of things Zarud appealed to the sheikh under the guise of friendship, bringing them a treaty was was supposedly mutually advantageous, Zarud actually compelled him to welcome the Zhentilar to their camp with open arms.</p>
<p>The plot was uncovered by the sheikh's daughter Ruha , the Harper agent Lander , and the tribe's strongest warrior Al'Aif ; but Zarud's magic continued to hold sway over Sabkhat and the sheikh did not cast away the Zhent mercenaries. Under the Sabkhat's orders, the Mtair Dhafir would serve as guides to the Zhentarim as they conducted their business across the desert, a conclusion that was acceptable to Zarud.</p>
<p>During the night following Zarud and Sabkhat's discussions, the Zhent agent was slain by Lander, the only other outlander in the Bedine camp.</p>
