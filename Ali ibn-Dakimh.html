<p>Ali ibn-Dakimh was a Calishite human enchanter and a member of the War Wizards of Cormyr in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He commonly wore wealthy attire comprising silks and velvets under a cloak that was azure or deep midnight-blue in color. It had a cowl that he used to hide his face. By his appearance, he could be recognized as Calishite.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He venerated three deities : Anachtyr , Azuth , and Mystra .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A native of Calimshan , Ali migrated to Cormyr, where he became a member of the War Wizards.</p>
<p>In the late 1360s DR, court wizard Vangerdahast dispatched Ali on a mission to track down various criminals who'd broken the laws of Cormyr , among them three thieves who'd been found guilty of murdering several Cormyrean nobles. Following certain rumors, in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Ali tracked the fugitives to Waterdeep and Undermountain , where it seemed they would try to hide out in Skullport .</p>
<p>In the month of Eleint , he was a regular at the Yawning Portal after paying in advance for a month's stay in Cormyrean coin. He maintained a low profile, not giving his full name, taking a corner booth and monitoring all who came out of the well to Undermountain. Of his purpose, he said only that he was looking for someone who owed a great deal to Cormyr. In fact, his fine clothes and mysterious nature drew attention and the Tymoran priest Adama Miiralin stationed at the inn made efforts to investigate him, which he mentioned in his monthly report to High Priestess Seenroas Halvinhar .</p>
