<p>Yuan-ti ( sing & pl ; pronounced : / j uː ɑː n ˈ t i / yoo-an-TEE listen or : / w ɑː n ˈ t i / wahn-TEE ) were a collective, and mostly psionic , race of serpentfolk , also known as the snake people of Malatra . They were often seen as corrupt and degenerate monsters by other races.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The appearance of yuan-ti varied greatly from nearly human -like to nearly snake -like, but all had some serpentine features. Scale colors were usually simple greens and browns, but more elaborate swirls, stripes, or diamond patterns were possible, even in blues and reds.</p>
<p>Yuan-ti gave off almost no scent that a human could detect, but animals could sense a dry, musty odor from their bodies.</p>
<p>Only the most human-like forms wore clothing, but all varieties wielded weapons if they had means to carry them.</p>
<h3>Varieties</h3>
<p>The yuan-ti came in several distinct castes or breeds. The three most prevalent were as follows:</p>
<p>In addition to the three main breeds, other breeds have been described as well:</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Most yuan-ti were evil beings, usually of the chaotic variety .</p>
<p>The yuan-ti had a great respect for reptiles of all kinds.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Yuan-ti had superb intelligence compared to other races.</p>
<p>Human-headed yuan-ti were able to cast the following magic innately: cause fear , darkness , snake charm , sticks to snakes , neutralize poison , suggestion , and polymorph .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>The yuan-ti took advantage of their great intelligence during battle, planning traps and making excellent use of their surroundings. They favored ambushes over direct attacks. If in groups, they sent their least valuable members forward first, meaning that purebloods advanced before halfbloods who advanced before abominations.</p>
<p>Yuan-ti favored bladed weapons. They used slow-acting poisons in their elaborate traps but not typically on their blades.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>The yuan-ti preferred to make their homes in tropical jungles.</p>
<p>Yuan-ti call themselves vrael olo (which means "favored ones"). Daily use typically uses the shortened "vrael", and can be modified to "auvrael" (meaning friendly or known yuan-ti) and "duthrael" (unfriendly or unfamiliar yuan-ti).</p>
<p>In general, the more serpentine features a yuan-ti possesses the higher its status in yuan-ti society. Abominations are at the top of their society, followed by halfblood, and finally purebloods. Within their subraces, yuan-ti are ranked by achievements and the demonstrated favor of Sseth.</p>
<p>Yuan-ti culture centered around their temples, which often were found in ancient ruins or hidden deep underneath human cities. The locations of these were well-guarded secrets.</p>
<p>Outside their temples, they usually only appeared in small groups of less than five.</p>
<p>Yuan-ti found the body odor of humans repulsive, so much so that in areas controlled by yuan-ti, humans wore perfume to conceal their body odor.</p>
<h3>Government</h3>
<p>The abominations ruled over the other breeds of yuan-ti, leading from the temples.</p>
<p>Purebloods, being the most human-like, were the caste involved in negotiations with outside races.</p>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>The yuan-ti were devout demon -worshipers. Their worship often involved bloody sacrifices. Most worshiped Sseth , with other serpentine deities that some have worshiped over the years either being masks worn by Sseth or a false deity of the Scaleless Ones. All yuan-ti must act in accordance with the Sacred Way of Sseth - that is, subtly. Whenever possible, yuan-ti choose manipulation over open confrontation, the whisper over the fang. Followers of the Sacred Way of Sseth know their foes, think ahead, and plan forward.</p>
<h3>Language</h3>
<p>Yuan-ti had their own language , which used the Draconic alphabet , and most could also speak Common . Draconic and Abyssal were also typically known. Some sages reported that all yuan-ti could also communicate readily with any snake or snake-like creature.</p>
<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>Yuan-ti buildings were often circular. In place of staircases, they often had ramps or poles instead, since most of them could slither and many of them could climb.</p>
<h3>Houses</h3>
<p>A number of ruling houses make up major power structures among the yuan-ti.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Yuan-ti were consummate carnivores, eating any kind of warm-blooded flesh, including humans. Besides human meat, they also enjoyed birds and thus kept large herds of flightless birds captive for food.</p>
<p>Female yuan-ti lay eggs in brood chambers, marking each clutch with its parentage, then abandoning them to the care of broodguards . Yuan-ti hatchlings are hatched from these eggs, which are always curious and eager to explore, and will seek food immediately, even eating each other if sustenance is not at hand. Their initial training is provided by broodguards, which also monitor the hatchery. Young yuan-ti are trained in the use of their powers almost immediately after being born. They will turn into tiny vipers and slither to the nearest cover when they see danger or hear a warning.</p>
<p>Yuan-ti in their prime will scheme, breed, and work on behalf of their tribes. Breeding is carefully controlled, seen as a holy act, in order to produce the "best" offspring. Prospective partners will coldly measure one another and if both agree that the match is promising, they usually mate, regardless of their personal affections towards each other.</p>
<p>Often elder yuan-ti grow lazy when they reach great age, sleeping or lying in torpor for longer and longer periods - first for days, then weeks, then seasons at a time, and finally years upon years. At last, they fail to wake at all.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The yuan-ti were once human. Long before humankind dominated the continent of Faerûn , the creator races ruled Toril . The reptilian creator race, the sarrukh , were foremost amongst these and built great empires. They bred the first yuan-ti by magically experimenting with and breeding humans with snakes and sarrukh, also creating nagas and lizardfolk . They eventually fell from power and the resourceful yuan-ti rose up to claim their creators' power, even while sustaining the empire of Mhairshaulk . Of the fragmented World Serpent deity that the sarrukh had worshiped, the yuan-ti venerated the strongest aspect, the cruel and despotic deity Merrshaulk , who grew distant and aloof.</p>
<p>Eventually, though, Merrshaulk had sunk into a slumber, ignoring his followers. Around the time of the collapse of the human empire of Netheril , Merrshaulk himself was also reborn as a winged yuan-ti avatar named Sseth , who became the yuan-ti's new primary deity. In the end, though, Sseth too sank into somnolence.</p>
<p>At this point, some sarrukh, long suffering a heavy war on other planes or sunken into hibernation in their ruins, began to return in some numbers. They crucially needed help from their deity, but Sseth was not answering prayers in his slumber. So for aid in their endeavors some of the sarrukh made a bargain with the Mulhorandi deity Set , that put Sseth into a deeper sleep but allowed Set to assume Sseth's mantle and grant the sarrukh their aid.</p>
