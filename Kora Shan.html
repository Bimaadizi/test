<p>The Kora Shan , also called the Swordrise Mountains , was a mountain range in the Hordelands .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Swordrise Mountains were separated from the Glittering Spires by a narrow pass through which the Golden Way passed. The mountain range extended southeast from the Glittering Spires into the Quoya Desert , effectively separating the Plain of Horses from the empire of Yaimunnahar and the plains of the vast majority of the Hordelands. The mountains themsleves were narrow compared to some of the larger mountain ranges found throughout the Hordelands.</p>
<p>The mountains featured greatly in the history and legends of the nomadic tribes of the steppe, as they divided the tribes as they did the lands.</p>
<p>A number of oases and springs were located along the base of the range , and served as battlefields for a number of raids and wars between the tribes who used them.</p>
