<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Blackwater Stout had twelve upstairs rooms available for rent but, given the raucous crowd usually found in the tavern below, sleep could be hard to come by. The establishment's name came from their in-house brew called Blackwater Stout which was a popular ale mixed with licorice. An impressive assortment of other alcoholic beverages could be enjoyed here as well. Popular food items served at the Blackwater Stout included cream puffs, chilled shrimp, and salted and roasted nuts. Talented troupes from Chessenta , Unther , and Sembia performed here often.</p>
