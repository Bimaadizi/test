<p>Illithid grafts referred to special flesh and body parts that were grafted onto a living creature by illithids ( mind flayers ).</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These grafts came in two kinds: illithid flesh that was melded onto other creatures, and other various body parts grafted onto creatures to increase their usefulness. Grafts were most often given to the illithids' slaves and thralls to make them more dangerous in combat or more useful as laborers. Having illithid flesh melded to their bodies also tended to weaken their free will. Horribly transformed thralls were a common sight in illithid settlements.</p>
<p>Illithid grafts were neither magical nor psionic . If removed from a creature, they could not be reused.</p>
<h3>Creation</h3>
<p>Attaching illithid parts to another creature required familiarity with medicine and specialized knowledge of how to graft flesh. Only illithids were able to learn these secrets in full, and many illithids were known to have mastered a wide range of grafting techniques. The illithids of Faerûn 's Underdark were known to treat the macabre practice of grafting as an artform,</p>
<p>Illithid grafting techniques were not related to ceremorphosis .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some scholars believed that the illithids were the very first to develop techniques for grafting flesh to another creature, although others argued that they had more likely learned the secrets from a fiend of corruption .</p>
<p>In the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , the Black Spear tribe of kobolds had struck a pact with the illithids of Ch'Chitl that included "gifts" of illithid grafts. By 1372 DR , the kobolds served as scouts in the environs around Waterdeep , and their grafts were inching them closer and closer toward becoming thralls.</p>
