<p>Yondalla ( pronounced : / j ɒn ˈ d ɑː l ɑː / yon-DAH-lah ) was the creator of the halfling race and matriarch of not only the halfling pantheon , but the whole race itself. With her charming personality and friendly demeanor she was an example to all halflings; who almost all shared her curiosity, loyalty and sense of mischief.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Yondalla had close bonds with Garl Glittergold , Corellon Larethian and Moradin . With the passion with which she loved and admired her fellow halfling deities, sometimes known as 'Yondalla's Children', she scorned certain evil deities, such as Bane , Cyric , Talona , Talos , and the Deities of Fury .</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Despite her widespread worship among halflings and her central role in their society; her temples were unusually rare, those that did exist were designed to look like a well-hidden halfling burrow-home and were filled with weapons and food so that the communities that surrounded them could hold out against possible invaders. Her clergy were afforded a lot of respect by the followers of other gods for their defensive capabilities in spite of their small stature.</p>
<p>Clerics of Yondalla considered the short sword to be a favored weapon, in honor of the Goddess' sword Hornblade . Powerful clerics were granted the ability to cast Curse of Yondalla , a spell reserved to be used against those who committed foul crimes against halflings.</p>
