<p>Konishi Ieyasu was the head of the ninja Konishi clan in Kozakura in 1357 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Ieyasu lived in Dojyu as a bushi named Kumorigawa Ieyasu who had retired from service to a korobokuru lord in distant Haso Province , but in truth he led the deathliest ninja clan in Kozakura.</p>
<p>Ieyasu, despite his age preventing him from acting himself, planned and supervised the most sensitive assignments undertaken by his ninja, while his youngest daughter, Konishi Seichi , oversaw all other family business. His presumed korobokuru ties allowed the ninja family to maintain a stance of neutrality in local politics, and ensured that bushi of "better breeding" payed little attention to their affairs.</p>
