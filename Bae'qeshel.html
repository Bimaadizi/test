<p>Bae'qeshel was a bardic art known to very few drow . Wielders of bae'qeshel were known as the "dark minstrels." The song was keening and magical.</p>
<p>Unlike divine magic , dark minstrels tapped into the Weave , and did not require a connection with a deity to wield it. However, according to Halisstra, it was sung in honor to Lolth .</p>
<p>The songs had a wide range of effects, often involving compulsion and other enchantments , but they also had more reality-altering abilities such as healing grievous wounds , creating dimension doors , and producing sonic blasts capable of stripping bark off of trees, as shown by Halisstra.</p>
