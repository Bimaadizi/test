<p>Littlefang was an enchanted short sword that fed on blood and restored the owner's vitality.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Littlefang appeared to have a metallic sheen, but the heft of the blade was carved out of an unknown beast's tooth. The sword was sheathed in a metal hilt, and its blade had fine holes. When wielded in battle, the blade emitted visible dark energy and made its greedy bloodthirsty essence felt.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The blade's fine holes soaked up all blood that touched Littlefang . The weapon used the consumed blood to heal its wielder, similarly to the effects of vampiric regeneration . Littlefang itself was enhanced with a +2 enchantment and had a chance of dealing devastating damage with a lucky strike.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the 1374 DR , Littlefang found home in the treasure hoard of two black dragons of the Mere of Dead Men – Voaraghamanthar and Waervaerendor who became obsessed with Harbor Mead and attempted to take over its production in the hamlet of West Harbor .</p>
