<p>Harboot's Tooth was a pinnacle of rock jutting up out of the plain of the eastern Shaar about a day's swift ride north of Delzimmer on the Trader's Way .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Tooth was about a hundred feet (thirty meters) tall and resembled a long-stemmed wine glass—a solid pillar that widened at the top into an inverted bell shape. It was located on the east side of Trader's Way, approximately a day and a half north of Delzimmer when traveling at wagon speed. On the side of the bowl of the wine glass was scratched an equilateral triangle with one point down and a circle (or an eye) inscribed inside. This symbol of unknown meaning was visible from the road. Atop the Tooth the view was excellent up and down the Way and across the Shaar to the east, but to the west was the Forest of Amtar .</p>
<p>On the opposite side of the Trader's Way were some pools fed by a spring that flowed out of the Forest of Amtar. The largest ones near the road were fit only for watering animals, but the smaller ones near the forest were clear, drinkable, and the most likely places to be ambushed by brigands or monsters emerging from the trees.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in the past, a peryton had an aerie here. After the peryton left, it became a roost for birds.</p>
