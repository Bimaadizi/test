<p>Jansibal Otharr was a nobleman from Hastarl in Athalantar in the early-to-mid 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was short and pouty, with red curly hair he kept oiled and a hairless chest. He had been seen dressed in an open-breasted shirt of flame-orange silk, with a fist-sized golden lion medallion and a very prominent gilt ivory codpiece.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Jansibal was quick to call for blood over even minor annoyances, or even for his own amusement. He was also notably lusty, to the point of risking the displeasure of the Magelords of Athalantar on occasion.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Jansibal was the only scion of the noble Otharr house, and he had a rivalry with Thalorn Selemban . He was often accompanied by two bodyguards and a servant that held a lamp over him, and his purse betimes as well.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Black Flame, 229 DR , Jansibal Otharr solicited the services of Shandathe Llaerin , a local pleasure-lass, rudely interrupting her flirting with local thief Eladar the Dark, actually the Prince Elminster Aumar . He almost caused a massacre as another local thief, Farl , took exception to him, but they were interrupted by the arrival of fellow dandy, Thalorn Selemban. They bandied some talk, but ultimately Jansibal simply went to a stall with Shandathe. While he was busy there, Farl and Eladar knocked him out and, with Shandathe's complicity, they lured Thalorn Selemban to the same stall and knocked him out too, robbing them both clean.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Chosen, 240 DR , the dandy was late in responding to the alarm bells of the Magelords of Athalantar in Athalgard . While running to his post, he injured Nanue Glarmeir , drawing the ire of her relative, Darrigo Trumpettower , who drew steel at him. This drew the attention of Thelorn Selemban, who honed in on him despite the danger. After being fought off, he ran away, but didn't get too far before Helm Stoneblade , one of the leaders of the invasion, struck him down, openly surprised at how easy this was.</p>
