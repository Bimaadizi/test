<p>Pokarr Gompa was a monastery (a gompa in the Tabotan language ) of the Way of Enlightenment in Tabot . It was nicknamed the Right Hand of U'Chan .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It stood in central Tabot, at the northern edge of the Haraki Ridge . Its position south of the capital U'Chan Gompa gave it its title; it stood opposite Lii Gompa , the Left Hand of U'Chan.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The monastery was formerly a fortress, built deep into the side of a mountain. The old keep still stood at the heart of the gompa. Beneath it lay tunnels or catacombs that stretched for miles.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The entrance to Pokarr Gompa had three wide gates made of stone that could be swung open or closed in a moment. For defense of the realm, it boasted a strong militia, including a fearsome cavalry, and they were known to have beat back attackers on countless occasions. Temple guards were garbed in dark-green pants and blouses, and wielded scimitars .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Pokarr Gompa famously housed many of great treasures and tomes of Tabot. In its four libraries were such works as Wang Tcu Lor 's religious treatises, Soo Enlahm 's journals and natural histories, and Ischan 's and Doka'zar 's masterpieces. The three separate treasure rooms kept secure the religious relics of Tabot, including holy remains, bones made of stone, a magical tapestry that hypnotized those who viewed it, four of the nine golden eggs of Ghastar , and many more. Also in the treasure rooms, rather than the libraries, was a five-volume holy book written by the first High Lord of Oceans, H'Dang Li .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was founded some time between Shou Year 585 (−665 DR) and Shou Year 640 (−610 DR) , when fifteen groups of monks and temple guardians escaped persecution in Shou Lung and journeyed southwest in search of a holy land that would remain pure and lasting, ideal for isolated hermitages. One of these groups built the beginnings of Pokarr.</p>
<p>The warrior Zife Yur went into the catacombs below Pokarr Gompa in Shou Year 2267 (1017 DR) and was never seen again. Thereafter, the lamas forbade anyone from going into them.</p>
<p>For a great festival at the Temple of Heaven's Heart on Mount E'kwong circa 2607, Abbot Mo Kin chose the monk scribe Pang to represent Pokarr Gompa, releasing him from an eight-year-long vow of silence in the process. On a pilgrimage to the site, accompanied by five temple guards, Pang spoke of Tabot to the Dragon Lord Mei Lung , who was attending as a guest from Shou Lung .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Pokarr Gompa was the primary rival to neighboring Lii Gompa. This might be why Pang spoke little of Lii to Mei Lung. Pang was also dismissive of Nafeen Gompa and Zotung Gompa , declaring they did not follow "the true and holy laws of the High Lord" as Pokarr did.</p>
<p>Pokarr Gompa regularly sent delegations to Do'dzin Gompa for four of its annual festivals.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>It housed over a thousand lamas and novices. They trained with the sword , learnt calligraphy , and were permitted to practice one other artform, as a devotion to the deities. They commonly chose to make pottery, using clay from south of Rokstang , and their works were renowned throughout Tabot. The greatest of their potters worked magic into the clay.</p>
<p>Pokarr Gompa was led by Abbot Mo Kin around Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The abbot of Pokarr was also commander of the militia, and was responsible for patrolling Tabot's eastern border with Shou Lung north of Mount E'kwong.</p>
