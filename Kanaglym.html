<p>Kanaglym ( pronounced : /ˈ k ɑː n ɑː g l ɪ m / KAN-ah-glim ) was an abandoned dwarven town located deep underground, within the Western Heartlands .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The town was carved directly out of the stone of Toril , arranged in a circular pattern around a central courtyard. Within that courtyard was the town's well, which gave Kanaglym's dwarven residents more than they bargained for.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Kanaglym was located entirely underground, beneath the High Moor , directly underneath Dragonspear Castle . It was accessible by a cave network that lay beneath the castle, through which flowed the Nepenthe River . The river passage was one notable means to gain access to the ruined dwarven city.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>As of the Era of Upheaval , the entrance to Kanaglym was protected by the ghost of the dragon Halatathlaer , former companion and mount of Daeros Dragonspear , founder of Dragonspear Castle.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the mid–6 th century DR , the Duchy of Hunnabar existed on the surface lands above Kanaglym.</p>
<p>Kanaglym was founded in the Year of the Last Hunt, 722 DR , when the High Moor was warm and fertile. However, a year after construction was completed, the town well ran dry. The well shaft was deepened and eventually struck water. However the source of this water was actually the Waters of Forgetfulness , which originated from the divine realm of Myrkul , the god of death. A month later the town was abandoned.</p>
<p>During the mid–13 th century, in the Year of the Raging Flame, 1255 DR , the adventurer Daeros Dragonspear raided a beholder lair that remained within the ruins of Kanaglym. He used the tremendous wealth he found within to begin construction on Dragonspear Castle, on the lands directly above Kanaglym's location.</p>
<p>In the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , the adventurer Midnight traveled alone through the caverns near the Nepenthe River until she came across the ruins of Kanaglym. There she encountered the specter of Kae Deverell , whose body briefly housed the avatar of the god Bhaal . While in the ruined town, Midnight traveled through a shimmering portal into the White Plain .</p>
<p>A decade later, in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , a necromancer by the name of Kherriun set up operations within the ruins of Kanaglym. He began to raise an army of undead slaves, to aid the efforts of his ally Hephernaan , a servant of the fiend Belhifet . Kherriun had acquired an amulet that allowed him control over Kanaglym's guardian, Halatathlear.</p>
<p>That same year, the wild mage Neera made a pilgrimage to Kanaglym to speak with the spirit of her deceased mentor Adoy .</p>
