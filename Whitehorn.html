<p>Whitehorn , named for the nearby sharp, snow-covered crags, was a frontier trading and resupply town for prospectors, miners, and woodcutters located in the White Peaks mountain range, east of the Ride .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Whitehorn was located on the southern slopes of Whitehorn mountain , overlooking the steppes of the Ride. The trail of Rogan's Sprint connected the town to Verdigris , another small town about 110 mi (180 km) to the southeast at the base of the Dragonspine Mountains .</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>The town was built within the Favored Fields of Chauntea , a valley nested between three mountain peaks. Volcanic rifts in the Underdark beneath the town warmed the area beneath the three peaks of the town.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was an unwalled town that began as a temple-farm dedicated Chauntea called the Favored Fields of Chauntea, before it grew and was settled by smithies and toolmakers and repairers. The muddy streets were lined with stone cottage buildings and there were dozens of wells.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>As a vassal-state to Phlan , Whitehorn was governed by a merchant council who elected a Steward to act as the local magister and to read the council's public decrees. The government levied a 1 sp "gate tax" on all departing wagons to fund the militia and an annual 2 gp "hearth tax" on all households, and an annual 4 gp tax on inns, taverns, and smithies to fund the government's works.</p>
<p>The town was represented by a red banner that symbolized the red blood of the orcs who attacked the town. A white triangle on the banner symbolized Old Jaw, the tallest crag in the center of the town.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The town was under constant threat of orc attack. It was defended by steep earthwork fortifications and has a standing militia. In the mid-1300s DR, a palisade, drawbridge, and spiked pit traps were added. Helmwatch House, a fortified temple and lookout tower atop Old Jaw, was home to clerics of Helm , whose worshipers and priests helped keep order by patrolling the streets and they helped defend the town. In 1390 DR , ballistae were installed atop the tower.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In either Ches or Tarsakh of the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR , Whitehorn was attacked by a ravaging band of barbarians that also overrun Verdigris and Ilinvur . Refugees from the town went south to Phlan seeking shelter and safety from their protector-state.</p>
