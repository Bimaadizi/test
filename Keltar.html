<p>Keltar , one of the oldest cities in Faerûn , was located in Calimshan and was famous for being the site of the House of the Broken God .</p>
<h2>Geography and Layout</h2>
<p>Keltar was located at the eastern edge of the Calim Desert along the deepest point of the Calim River . The majority of the city was on the west side of the river, but the cattle processing centers were on the east side. It was one of the smaller cities of Calimshan — a town by usual Calishite standards — and contained eight sabbans composed of 24 drudachs . Unlike with other Calishite cities, Keltar's sabbans were named after the eight points of the compass.</p>
<p>The city contained a massive sluice gate to divert the waters of the Calim River and boasted many canals flowing through its easternmost sabbans. In Northeast Sabban, these canals turned waterwheels to power mills and also giant fans, which were designed to blow the smell of cattle pens, slaughterhouses, and tanneries away. In other areas of the city, they were used for fishing and swimming or for travel in gondolas .</p>
<p>The House of the Broken God (see below) encompassed the entire Northwest Sabban.</p>
<p>Outside of Keltar, the Calim River provided relatively fertile farmland for crops, and the surrounding shanate was dominated by herds.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>In 1370 DR , Keltar was ruled by Sultan Duncan el Ashnarti , and he had held his position of power there for at least a dozen years. Because he was married to a woman from el Ahimar crime family, who were in turn subservient to the syl-pasha , he controlled the underworld in Keltar as well. Despite his strong grip on the city, he was a wise ruler, and Keltar was for the most part a peaceful city.</p>
<p>The surrounding shanate was controlled by Ynamalik Uras el Ihak . Since he was good friends with Sultan Ashnarti, he was not a political threat to the latter's power.</p>
<p>Because it contained more cattle than people, Keltar did not have a high reputation among Calishites and was therefore the least political of all Calimshan's cities.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>All kinds of livestock were traded, herded, slaughtered, and packed here, including cattle, camels, buffalo, and other exotic herd animals. Keltar was also well known for its leather trade, especially its fine saddles, most notably those manufactured by Tenassar Saddleworks .</p>
<p>Keltar's slave trade focused primarily on goblinoids . Most of these slaves were exported to Calimport or Thay .</p>
<p>Because the city was so cattle-driven, it did not cater to adventurers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Keltar was as old as Calimport, making it older even than Waterdeep . It was founded sometime after −7800 DR by the great genie Calim and became part of the Calim Caliphates .</p>
<p>Throughout its history, the city was destroyed and rebuilt many times:</p>
