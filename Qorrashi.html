<p>Qorrash ( sing : qorrashi ) were genies of cold and ice.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Qorrash were elemental creatures native to the Plane of Air . They had blue skin, which was always covered in thick frost, because a perpetual aura of bitter cold always emanated from their bodies. They had white hair. Males were often bald and sported fancy goatees; females wore their hair long. A typical qorrashi stood over ten feet (300 centimeters) tall and weighed about half a ton.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Qorrash had such a strong connection to ice that they could walk on any surface of ice—even upside down. Like other genies, they had a wide assortment of inherent magical powers, including but not limited to the ability to turn invisible , to summon a storm of ice , to turn into a gaseous form , and to walk on the wind . A qorrashi could create food and water and other items and generate powerful illusions . They could blast a cone of cold from their palms, and anyone struck by one of their blows would suffer a severe chill that could lead to frostbite.</p>
<p>Like all genies, qorrashi had darkvision and could plane shift to the elemental planes , the Astral Plane , or the Prime .</p>
<h2>Language</h2>
<p>Qorrash usually spoke Auran , Celestial , Common , and Ignan . They were also telepathic.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Qorrashi enjoyed fighting more than djinn did. They were confident in battle, yet they still used their magic to weaken their foes from a distance before closing in. If badly injured, they were not too proud to retreat.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The qorrash were distantly related to the djinn.</p>
<p>Qorrash shared a special relationship in the governance of the ancient giants of the Jhothûn Empire.</p>
