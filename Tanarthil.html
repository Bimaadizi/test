<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tanarthil came across an Eilistraean rite at some point in or prior to the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , and judging them as engaging in some foul purpose, attempted to eliminate the dancing drow by using his staff. In response, the drow priestess leading the rite, Qilué Veladorn , blocked his first spell, turned the second one into the sign of Mystra , and then had him dragged back to Waterdeep by his staff. She had some trouble convincing her fellow priestesses not to kill him.</p>
<p>She would remind her fellow priestesses of the event during a later intrusion.</p>
