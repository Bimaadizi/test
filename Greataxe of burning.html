<p>Greataxes of burning were enchanted weapons wielded by the strongest among the Riders of Nesmé to help them in the struggle against the trolls of the Evermoors and adopted into use sometime before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Greataxes of burning were truly huge weapons that took the strongest of warriors to wield with finesse in battle. Each of these axes possessed a simple +1 enchantment that guided the wielder's hands towards the target and made the axe's slashes more deadly. Their axeheads were shrouded in flames, searing and burning anything and anyone that met the axe's edge.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These axes were wielded by Riders of Nesmé who defended their home from the constant threat of trollish hordes that spilled out of the nearby Evermoors. In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , a greataxe of burning could be found in the inventory of Graendel Granitefist 's smithy and shop in the town of Targos of Icewind Dale .</p>
