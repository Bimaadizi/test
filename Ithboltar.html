<p>Ithboltar was a male wizard who was the leader of the magelords of Athalantar and was killed in Elminster Aumar 's insurrection.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ithboltar was a powerful member of the magelords from the start of their power, most of the magelords began as apprentices of him: first Neldryn Hawklyn , later Kadeln Olothstar and Seldinor Stormcloak . Thus Ithboltar was the closest to a leader of the magelords as possible.</p>
<p>However, when Elminster Aumar began his insurrection, his students appeared too disunited to fight together against the rebels. In the end, Elminster with a powerful spell destroyed Ithboltar and the few remaining magelords agreed to fight together.</p>
