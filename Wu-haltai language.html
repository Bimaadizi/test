<h2>Related languages</h2>
<p>Wu-haltai was related to Issacortae and Pazruki , other languages in the Amaese languages group.</p>
<p>As with the other Amaese languages, Wu-haltai was considered to be "only vaguely related" to the Eastern Imaskari languages group.</p>
<p>The Wu-haltai tongue had many points in common with the language of the ogre magi , presumably acquired from the ogre tribes of the region.</p>
