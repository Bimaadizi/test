<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Lawless Castle was beneath the Horn Hills of Athalantar , and was accessible from Wind Cavern .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The depths of the cave had luminescent, red fungi , and a warm hot spring that made the air dank and damp, but warm.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Presumed to have been originally built by dwarves , and shown to Helm Stoneblade , the redoubt was repurposed as a hideout by rebel Knights of Athalantar in the early 3 rd century DR , during the reign of King Belaur Aumar . The Stout Folk sometimes provided covert aid to the Knights of Athalantar, who found supplies in there. A band led by Sargeth remained there as outlaws for a number of years.</p>
<p>On Hammer of the Year of the Loremasters, 228 DR , the location was found by scouting parties from Athalantar. Though Helm Stoneblade helped ride down the scouts that found it, preventing them from informing their superiors, it was finally abandoned as the Magelords of Athalantar were finally were able to pinpoint the location anyway.</p>
