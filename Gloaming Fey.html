<p>The Gloaming Fey were a loosely organized alliance of fey in the Feywild who were variously associated with dreams, dusk, stars, night, twilight, and other nocturnal phenomena. They were, at times, conflated with the fell Unseelie Court .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>They were often said to be a league rather than a proper faction, and they typically kept their own counsel. When the Court of Stars met, however, they banded together for that intrigue.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>Of the archfey associated with the Gloaming Fey, the most well-known was the Maiden of the Moon , a hunter with a silver sword that was benevolent towards mortals. She spent her time waging a private war against lycanthropes and other savage killers. At her bidding, members of the Gloaming Fey might join the Wild Hunt . Cerunnos , Master of the Hunt, also came to stand amongst the Gloaming after an encounter with the Maiden.</p>
<p>The Prince of Hearts was another of Gloaming archfey, but a far more capricious one despite being dedicated to such concepts as gallantry, love, and beauty. He delighted in both bringing true lovers, separated by circumstance, together, while at other times he was drawn more to the fire of unrequited love, and in either mood he would meddle in the lives of mortals.</p>
<p>The third, and darkest, archfey associated with the Gloaming Fey was the Witch of Fates , an oracle who often pronounced doom. At Cendriane 's height, she was the one to speak the prophecy of its fall. She was also known to bring low the powerful and proud, but also to raise up the virtuous caught in wretched conditions.</p>
