<p>Wayrock was both an island and an 11,000-ft. (3,400-m) mountain in the Sea of Fallen Stars . It was visible from up to 100 miles (161 km) away. The only man-made structures on it were a ruined keep on the eastern slope and a temple of Cyric , which had been stripped, stolen, and placed upon the Wayrock by the githvyrik sorcerer Vhostym . It later became a temple to Mask , guarded closely by his exarch Drasek Riven .</p>
