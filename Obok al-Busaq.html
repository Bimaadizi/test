<p>Obok al-Busaq , also called Obok the Slaver , was a pottery dealer inhabiting in Hiyal around 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>By day Obok was a harmless pottery vendor like many others. By night however, he operated Hiyal's black market that primarily sold all manner of intelligent creatures. These included everything from sentient exotic creatures, to hapless foreigners, to scared children captured by desert raiders.</p>
<p>The Sultana allowed Obok to operate his illicit venture so long as he promised to keep her own stock of slaves filled, which also included her sons' harims , and to run his operation as quietly as possible. She promised to shut down his business should news of it ever reach the wrong ears.</p>
