<p>The nimblewright detector was a one of a kind device designed to locate nimblewrights that was created around the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This device was made of copper , measured 1 foot (0.3 meters) in length, had a trigger, and had an umbrella protrustion at its end. If one were to cast detect magic on it, they would find that it radiated an aura of divination magic.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Activating this device required holding down on its trigger. When active, the umbrella on the device would click, spin, and whir whenever it detected a nimblewright within 500 feet (150 meters) of it that wasn't its creator Nim. This clicking, spinning, and whirring would increasingly accelerate the closer one got to a nimblewright, reaching maximum velocity once the wielder was within 30 feet (9.1 meters).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This device was created around 1492 DR by Nim , a nimblewright in the House of Inspired Hands , after another nimblewright that it had created to ease its loneliness fled from the temple in confused terror. It was only after having created the device that Nim learned that they couldn't leave the temple grounds. Later on, the errant nimblewright fell under the service of Yalah Gralhund and went on to detonate a fireball for him in Trollskull Alley as part of an assassination attempt on the gnome Dalakhar . A group of adventurers later came to the temple due to these events and while there learned of Nim's plight, who proceeded to gift them his nimblewright detector and teach them how it worked.</p>
