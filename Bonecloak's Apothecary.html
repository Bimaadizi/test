<p>Bonecloak's Apothecary was a potionmaker 's shop located in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Bonecloak's Apothecary stood to the north of the Sorcerous Sundries shop in the Heapside neighborhood of Baldur's Gate. Just like the shop of wizardly goods, Bonecloak's Apothecary stood on the strake called Murl's Rest , on the crossing of Stormshore Street and Old Town Avenue . Its next-door neighbor was the Highberry family estate that was known to host wine festivals.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The apothecary was a flowering ivy -covered building with two floors and attic space. A small greenhouse was built into the shop's side, and it expanded into a sizable underground cave utilized to grow supplies and serve as a laboratory. The First floor was taken by the shop, and the second floor was used as living quarters by the Bonecloaks.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>One of the substances sold by Bonecloak's was alchemical bloodstain removerâ€“a regular purchase delivered to the Szarr Palace .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, during the Absolute crisis , Bonecloak's Apothecary was run by Derryth Bonecloak and Baelen Bonecloak , a married dwarven couple . After Baelen was left feebleminded , the business was largely run by Derryth from some half from her simple husband. She prepared concoctions and potions and regularly traveled to the Ebonlake Grotto , a friendly myconid colony in the Underdark to resupply and search for an immensely valuable noblestalk mushroom . At that time, a stray alley cat Myshka might have found a new home with Derryth in the shop. It was unknown if Baelen's mental capabilities were restored with the use of noblestalk to produce a cure.</p>
