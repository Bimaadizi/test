<p>Emrys was a large town in the southern Border Kingdoms in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The town was located on the northern edge of the Shaar , within the Talduth Vale . Emrys occupied a large hill near the southern banks of Emrysar Lake . The town was commonly called the "Throat of Talduth Vale" due to its location on the Sheep Road, which connected the Border Kingdoms to the Shaar. Farmers frequently used this road to bring their flock to the edge of the Shaar for grazing.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The town was governed by a council of six Grand Merchant Dukes, whose position on the council was hereditary, and an Imperial Overduke. The purpose of the Imperial Overduke, who was elected by the citizens of the town for a seven-year term, was to act as a stopgap against the power and corruption of the Grand Merchant Dukes and to provide the citizens of Emrys a voice in the government. In reality however, those elected as Imperial Overduke were either quickly corrupted or drugged and poisoned. Despite the corruption and cruelty of the Grand Merchant Dukes, most Emryans continued to support the government.</p>
<p>The Grand Merchant Dukes owned a large amount of Emrys's buildings. Real estate was a valuable commodity in the town due to its scarcity, and was costly. One of the methods the Dukes maintained power with was by providing real estate in exchange for fealty. The Grand Merchant Dukes also used powerful magical items and a large spy ring to maintain power. They were so jealous of their power and paranoid in maintaining said power, that they did not tolerate the presence of anyone whose popularity or wealth could influence the townsfolk.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Emrys was an affluent trading center in the southern Border Kingdoms. The town was known for having a wide variety of shops offering goods and services at reasonable prices. A large farmers market called the Bawling Market was a thriving place of business. It was named such due to the large amount of farmers who sold sheep and wool.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Emrys was a fortified town, protected by two large walls that formed a concentric circle around the settlement. Emrystarl's Keep was found in the center of town. The massive fortress held the town's garrison. Beneath the Keep was a network of caverns which contained armories and supply stores as well as a stream of fresh water.</p>
<p>The town guard, called the Eagles of Emrys, defended the town and were also the local constabulary. Its ranks were mostly experienced adventurers from abroad. Their duties included inspecting arriving and departing merchants, collecting taxes and patrolling the Talduth Vale. In emergencies, the personal body guards and house guards of the Grand Merchant Dukes assisted the Eagles.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The town was founded around the ancient Emrystarl's Keep. The Keep was one of the oldest structures in the Border Kingdoms. The Keep, and the town itself, were named after Emrystarl. who was rumored to be a powerful warrior who was undefeated in battle. Local legends held that Emrystarl left behind a hidden treasure, and his phantom walked the corridors of the Keep at night.</p>
