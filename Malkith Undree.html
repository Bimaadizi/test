<p>Malkith Undree was the Magister from 298 DR to 302 DR . He was infamous for his superior attitude and relentless scheming.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was soft-spoken, and always smiled. A shrewd and very good judge of character, he misliked other archmages taking an interest in his doings. He was presumably quite economical with the amount of work he did, even somewhat lazy. At least one other mage described him as "a fat, contented cat, looking down his nose at the world". Nonetheless, he prepared contingencies for many things. Extremely manipulative, though most of his influencings were for profit, some were for sport.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Malkith was best known for scrying extensively.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>On becoming Magister, Malkith employed magic to acquire a caravan company and moneylender from Amn . By the end of his tenure, he had acquired at least one enchanted scepter.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Malkith devoted much of his time to scrying, and to anticipating the actions of others.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally from Halruaa, Malkith left the country to pursue his own interests without other mages concerning themselves with his actions. At the time Azuth offered him the office of the Magister , Malkith was living in a rooming house somewhere in the Vilhon , studying the minutiae of local trade. After becoming the Magister, he took over a caravan company and moneylending business in Amn, then devoted himself to scrying on other mages, appearing only to seize magic from the ones that were on the verge of death, to reveal the works of those he counted as potential rivals to whoever oppossed them. He also engaged in extensive manipulations. Despite the fact he killed few mages personally, he became one of the most feared and hated Magisters, even by the clergy of Mystra. Malkith died alone in his tower in the Starspire Mountains , Malkith's Tower , after he was beheaded during a mishap with a magical scepter he was experimenting with. His tower continued to be a hazard for years to come.</p>
