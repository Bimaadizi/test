<p>Tranquility Grove was a mushroom-filled cavern near the drow city of Sschindylryn , and a peril to unwary travelers.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Grove was a loop of cavern filled with mushrooms , some of which were bioluminescent. What made it particularly notable was the soporific quality of the mushroom spores, which relaxed and calmed those that breathed it in. If someone fell asleep in Tranquility Grove, they were unlikely to ever wake and simply eventually die in their sleep. It was said that their souls would remain trapped in the Grove, tormented and unable to reach their final rest.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the local drow, elves were immune to the effects of the spores.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The cavern was located not far from the Great Waterfall and the drow spider hatchery .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The cavern was home to few except the unfortunates who wandered in and fell into an eternal slumber, such as yuan-ti expeditionaries, illithids , and the drow that came to laugh at them. A number of will-o'-wisps also floated about, believed to be the unhappy souls of those who died there.</p>
