<p>A mirror was an object that reflected an image, as long as a light source was present.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In general, the surfaces of mirrors were made of glass , which was sometimes silvered . This meant their surfaces were rather brittle, and could be easily smashed. The frames of mirrors were usually made of silver or steel , with the latter being far harder. Some mirrors around the Realms were easily transportable, and such mirrors were known as hand mirrors .</p>
<p>Though many mirrors were mundane, there were also several magical ones throughout the Realms. Some magical mirrors could sell for 1,000s of gold pieces.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Mirrors could be used to reflect powerful rays back at enemies. This was particularly the case for medusae , as mirrors could reflect their petrifying gaze back at them, turning them to stone. Some mirrors could be used to scry on others.</p>
<p>It was possible to access a mysterious plane, the Plane of Mirrors , via a mirror. In this plane were several sets of mirrors that led to many different places.</p>
<p>A whole mirror or a small piece of one was used as a material component for a variety of spells in the Realms. These included dark mirror , detect scrying , spell turning , flesh mirage , physical mirror , and spell mirror . Older versions of sanctuary and scrying required a small silver mirror to cast, as did improved sanctuary . Additionally, a piece of a broken mirror was needed to cast Bane of Beshaba and crushed glass from one was needed to cast damage mirror .</p>
<p>Spells unique to the land of Kara-Tur that required a mirror to cast included remember and fire enchantment .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mirrors had been used throughout the history of Faerûn . Glass mirrors dated as far back as the time of Netheril , where they first became available in 1985 NY (−1874 DR) .</p>
<p>Some regions, such as the Land of the Lions , even produced mirrors and exported them to others towns and cities across the land.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Many faiths across Toril used mirrors to represent their deities. An aspect of Shekinester , the Empowerer, was represented by a mirror. The Spirit of the Sun of Kara-Tur was said to grant his followers, such as Matasuuri Shogoro , gifts, which included mirrors.</p>
<p>Large mirrors were outlawed in Turmish due to the fear of fetch , predatory creatures of the Abyss who used mirrors as portals to the Prime Material plane . An unsettling Turmite folk song about fetch was a popular explanation of the strange mirror-banning law.</p>
