<p>Calimban Knoll , formerly called Calim's Bane , was a stone circle marking where a battle was fought in the Calim Desert at the end of the Fourth Age of Calimshan .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Located near the northern border of the Calim Desert, 25 miles (40,000 meters) south of Memnon just off the Trade Way , Calimban Knoll was a circle of 21 menhirs 700 yards (640 meters) in diameter with a tiny, rocky mound in the center. The appearance of this site varied depending on conditions in the desert. At times, the hill was exposed; at other times, sand covered the knoll, such that only the tops of the standing stones were visible. By 1370 DR , a third of the stones had toppled over.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The site memorialized where a small band of escaped slaves held off a full legion of Calishite soldiers in the Fourth Age of Calimshan.</p>
<h2>Rumors and Legends</h2>
<p>Despite the passage of centuries, some magic seemed to preserve the menhirs, and Memnon's Crackle was unable to disturb the site.</p>
