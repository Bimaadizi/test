<p>An abominable yeti was a huge and monstrous yeti that was several times more powerful than a regular tundra yeti.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Abominable yetis were around three times taller than humans , such that were even larger than hill giants . They were superior to other tundra yetis in almost every way, apart from being somewhat less dexterous. Abominable yetis were not just larger and stronger versions of yetis; they even had unique abilities, such as being able to breathe a freezing cone of frigid air over their enemies.</p>
<p>They were perceptive, and despite their towering height, were surprisingly stealthy.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Such monstrosities were hateful and predatory. They were territorial and would attack warm-blooded creatures on sight. The yetis would subsequently devour the creatures, and toss their remains across the icy plains.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Abominable yetis made very tough opponents in combat. They were even stronger than frost giants , and could take about three times more damage than regular yetis before falling to their deaths. The most powerful ability of such yetis was to breathe a deathly cold cone of air over multiple opponents in front of them.</p>
<p>As with regular yetis, abominable yetis were highly inclined to the cold, and thus could resist cold-based attacks. They also feared fire , which would put even the most hulking abominable yetis at a disadvantage.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>These yetis would often live and hunt alone, but it was not unreasonable for them to be found in pairs, usually when raising young.</p>
