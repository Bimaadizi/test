<p>Suj was an island in the Trackless Sea and a part of the country of Lantan .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Suj was the southern companion of the island of Lantan, being separated from it by the channel known as the Sambar Run . The island was almost cleaved by the Suj-lan , a narrow bay in the southwest coast. In parts, it was fairly hilly with rocky pinnacles emerging from lush jungles. The Lantanna inhabitants made their aerial homes on these peaks.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Suj was ruled by the Ayrorch , the Council of Twelve based in Sambar , and was protected by the same "secret weapons" as Lantan itself. The dominant faith was that of Gond , led by High Artificer Danactar in Illul .</p>
<h2>Locations</h2>
<p>Suj was the site of several settlements, and one port city, Anchoril.</p>
