<h2>History</h2>
<p>Phiirornaera was petrified by Kurtal at some point before 886 DR and put in an embarassing position by his bath to serve as a towel-holder; even in stone form, she somehow co-opted the web of spells he used to query the heads of his rivals for knowledge and advice. She influenced him so into ever bolder actions.</p>
<p>About a century after his death, by 1000 DR , a rockslide covered the cavern home of Kurtal; still petrified, Phiirornaera remained in there until at least the late 14 th century DR .</p>
