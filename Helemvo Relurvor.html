<p>Helemvo Relurvor , also known as Helemvo the Peerless or the Dread King , was the king of the realm of the Mount in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Helemvo was a small, balding man with glittering black eyes.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Tutored by the most vicious Ravenaars his father could find, Helemvo developed a cold, sour and twisted personality. With Tholander on his deathbed, Helemvo poisoned most of his siblings to cement his control over the realm. He was no stranger to intrigue and murder, targeting wealthy individuals to increase his own power.</p>
<p>Helemvo was overly cautious, bordering on paranoia. He regularly spied on the inhabitants of his realm using magic, both watching them and invading their mind. He was particularly wary of mind flayers and other wizards , eliminating them using poison, patrol attacks, or well-timed "accidents".</p>
<p>The Dread King disliked combat and would rather flee when challenged, using magic to vanish or transform innocent folks into false duplicates of himself to be killed in his stead. He also used magic to hide his true shape when flirting with ladies, or when he wanted to visit his realm incognito.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Helemvo spent most of his time trying to increase his wealth and power without attracting too much attention on his secretive realm. He kept a jealous eye over the Way of Screaming Swords , deploying various magical means to tightly control who used the portal .</p>
