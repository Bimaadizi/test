<p>Largo Crivens was one of the inhabitants of Reithwin , the town that once venerated Sel√ªne in the Western Heartlands , sometime before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Largo perished in a tragic event sometime before the fall of Reithwin, before the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , and before it was consumed by the Shadow-cursed Lands . The event took the lives of Largo and almost every member of the Crivens clan, including the family dog , outlived only by Errick Crivens , who was, in some way, the cause of the tragedy. Largo Crivens the Younger was buried in Reithwin's graveyard behind the House of Healing in a cluster surrounded by the graves of his family. The tombstone read: "In memory of Largo Crivens, taken along with his family on the same grim night. May their deaths be avenged." The Crivens family's grave markers remained relatively undamaged and legible as of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR .</p>
