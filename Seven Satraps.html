<p>The Seven Satraps were the men who led the rebels of the Schamedar Plains to the depose Shond Tharovin and the Cult of the Living Gem from Schamedar during the Living Gem War .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The group was formed in the month of Eleasias in the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR from among the towns and villages primarily along the River of Ice in eastern Calimshan . They publicly promised to be ready to sacrifice their lives if necessary to defeat Shond Tharovin, who had taken control of the city of Schamedar the month prior.</p>
<p>Seemingly in response, strange dark creatures appeared from the skies over the next few months and began to murder and pillage.</p>
<p>By the month of Uktar , the Seven Satraps had managed to raise an armed force, and they laid siege to the city. The Living Gem hovered above the walls and sent down fire and lightning on the attackers, but the Satraps army maintained the siege for nearly a year, until at last the Cult of Gem went into hiding, taking the Living Gem with them.</p>
<p>Afterward, the syl-pasha of Calimport declared that the Seven Satraps would be the new rulers of Schamedar.</p>
<p>There rule began in 1368 DR , but it seems to have been short-lived, as by 1370 DR , the people of Schamedar had chosen an elf to be their new Syl-Vizar.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>As the name implies, there were seven men who called themselves the Seven Satraps. Three of them were Batras el Beza , Daud el Akiil , and Saibh el Moadyph . After the defeat of the Cult of the Living Gem, these three controlled most of the leaders of Schamedar, and guided them to do the will of El Kahmir crime family. The other four Satraps were never able to unify against the three in any meaningful way.</p>
