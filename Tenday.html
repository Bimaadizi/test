<p>A tenday was a Faer√ªnian unit of time. The Calendar of Harptos divided the thirty-day months into three blocks of ten days each, or simply put, "tendays". The word was used interchangeably with the Earth term "week".</p>
<p>Other terms used synonymously with tendays included eves , domen , hyrar , and rides . As of 1367 DR , "rides" was the preferred term throughout Cormyr and the Dalelands .</p>
<p>Followers of the gnome deity Gaerdal Ironhand called tendays Tenhammers , after a custom of striking a metal shield with a large hammer at the end of each day and because ten days was a typical duration of guard duty for them. After ten Tenhammers, the final day was a holy day known as a Great Clang.</p>
