<p>The Red Rock was a stone and wood inn located in Dagger Falls run by the half-elven ex-minstrel Kessla .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The taproom of the Red Rock was illuminated by magical globes of light rather than candles, courtesy of Kessla's magic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Red Rock survived inspections from the Zhentarim and countless brawls that would erupt inside. Despite this, it was burned to the ground by an army of orcs . The Lord of Daggerdale Randal Morn did not have enough money to rebuild the inn, though some adventurers lent money to Kessla for restoration before 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Kessla was assisted by a stable boy named Orthran and two waitresses, Larstiira and Jandylgrae .</p>
