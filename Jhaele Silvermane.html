<p>Jhaele Silvermane was the proprietor of the Old Skull Inn in Shadowdale in the late 14th century DR.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Jhaele was a motherly woman with graying hair. She once possessed a powerful physique, but her body grew frail in her old age. She usually wore her leather apron , over a white blouse, and a leather skirt when she was managing her inn.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>A shrewd judge of character, she was known for her sharp tongue and stern, sober demeanor. These qualities endeared Jhaele to her patrons and kept troublemakers away from the inn. Nothing could surprise or unnerve Jhaele, she's experienced everything a taproom could throw her way, beautiful songstresses who claimed old tone-def Jhaele taught them beautiful songs, famous boards, Zhentharim occupation, creatures from other worlds wreaking havoc at the inn.</p>
<p>During the Zhentarim occupation of Shadowdale, she pretended to be a senile, old crone, causing the mercenaries to leave her alone.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Jhaele was very skilled with throwing daggers and had a handful stashed around, in case of trouble.</p>
<p>She often used her knife and dagger proficiency to intimidate guests she knew were trying to run on the bill. She brought the bill, then skewered it to the table with one powerful stab. That display never needed repeating and created applause around the room.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Apart from the Old Skull, Jhaele also owned a farm in Shadowdale, ran by her eldest son Durgo.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Jhaele had a big family, her eldest son Durgo Silvermane ran the family farm not too far from the Old Skull. The rest of her children, the youngest son Braun Silvermane , the middle son Purn Silvermane , and daughters Belestar Silvermane and Raith Silvermane all were pursuing careers in trading and adventuring.</p>
<p>By 1367 DR , Jhaele was widowed, with her husband being dead for a decade.</p>
<p>After her husband's passing, Jhaele had a lover - Emrock Uerngul , commonly known as the Mad Merchant. He was a one-time thief and eventually a caravan master, that came to be infatuated with Jhaele during his stops in Shadowdale.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Old Skull Inn was built circa 1277 DR by Jhaele's father Buldo , and she inherited it upon his death, taking over management of the business.</p>
<p>Circa 1350 DR , Jhaele became close with the all-female adventuring group Company of the Swanmays during the winters they spent in Shadowdale. She often joined the women for an evening of adventuring stories and strong drinks.</p>
<p>In 1357 DR , the hero Alias with her companions stopped at the Old Skill Inn. Alias remembered Jhaele from her time in Shadowdale with the Swanmays. Unfortunately, Jhaele had no recollection of Alias even though she remembered the adventuring group fondly. Jhaele did promise to the mysterious young woman that she would not forget her again, especially after the beautiful song Alias sang about the Standing Stone for the inn's patrons.</p>
<p>In Eleint of 1367 DR , Jhaele Silvermane acquired a peculiar trophy to display at the Old Skull Inn, a dead, remarkably big, yellow-colored, giant wolf spider , that emitted magical glow even long after its death. The spider was slain in the woods to the south from Shadowdale, stuffed, and traded for a week's lodging, and as much ale as one could drink, by a lucky adventurer.</p>
<p>By Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR , the year of Zhentarim occupation, Jhaele's son Durgo had taken over the day-to-day running of the inn. Shadowdale was taken over by the Zhent forces, Lord Mourngrym Amcathra governed at the sufferance of the conquerors, and Elminster's Tower laid in ruins. Jhaele adopted the role of a harmless senile crone, avoiding Zhentarim agents' attention. She was allowed to freely sit in the Old Skill Inn or wander the village without attracting any attention. Eventually, she heard of the adventuring group that worked against the occupations' forces and volunteered to spy on the Zhent agents for them, aiding in the town's subsequent liberation.</p>
