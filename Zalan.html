<p>Maestro Zalan was a fencing teacher of Lyrabar in Impiltur in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<p>After Taegan Nightwind 's academy was burned down by the Cult of the Dragon in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , he immediately began talking to Stedd , Taegan's provost, despite it being very early in the morning of Ches 13 . The avariel suspected that Zalan was attempting to hire Stedd to be his provost, and thought that the latter might have to disclose their secrets; he briefly considered issuing a challenge to Zalan, but was talked out of it by Corkaury Mindle .</p>
