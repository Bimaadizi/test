<p>Black grog ale was a cheap watered down ale favored by the pirates and criminal elements of Waterdeep and Immurk's Hold of the Pirate Isles .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Black grog ale was brought to Waterdeep by the immigrants from the Pirate Isles of the Sea of Fallen Stars . The pirates who found a new home in Waterdeep served as the core consumers of the grog and eventually the local taverns and inns started importing numerous barrels of the grog from Immurk's Hold.</p>
<p>By 1372 DR , black grog ale was being moved from Waterdeep to other cities along the Sword Coast and down the Trade Way , such as Daggerford , (available from Happy Cow and Black Stone Inn ), as well as Liam's Hold .</p>
