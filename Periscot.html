<p>Periscot was a halfling thief and cook in the late 14 th century DR who died while on an expedition in the Shining Sea .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , sometime around the month of Flamerule , a group of eccentric entertainers, entrepreneurs, and scientists embarked upon a colonizing expedition to an island they discovered in the Shining Sea off the coast of Chult , which they dubbed the " Forgotten Island ". Periscot was among the members of this group, alongside her thief husband Jarkus . Led by a charismatic Waukeenar priest named Devlin , the group sought to create a tourist attraction on the isle that would attract wealthy people from all across the Realms. Three months later, things began to go awry for the expedition.</p>
<p>On Marpenoth 5 , two members of the group by the names of Argus and Wedonai were patrolling the island and came across the horrifically mutilated corpse of a stegosaurus . Wedonai would go on to express concerns about angered forest spirits , whilst Argus would tell Devlin that the creature's wounds suggested an attack from another dinosaur . Instead of letting the issue trouble his mind, Devlin decided to spent much of the day instructing Periscot in the kitchen, since their potential investor Prince Faruq of Calimport had a particular palate.</p>
<p>On Marpenoth 11 , five velociraptors attacked the expedition's campsite and the team managed to slay them, but not without Argus dying and the fighter Mallus getting injured. The next day Periscot's husband Jarkus left with Wedonai and the mage Briella Farthing to check on the Sacred Heart of the Beast , an ancient Sunite relic the expedition had brought with them that was supposed to have made docile all of the animals on the island. Sailing off the island began to be considered, but could not be pursued as heavy storms kept everyone else in the campsite for Marpenoth 13 and 14 . When the storms finally let up on Marpenoth 16 , the group went on to the docks and discovered their ships were wrecked, thus stranding them on the island.</p>
<p>Over the course of the next three days, the group became infected with olive slimes due to close proximity with Mallus, who had contracted an infection from the velociraptors. On the night of the third day, Marpenoth 19 , Devlin snuck into the barracks and murdered everyone inside. Finding bits of olive slime on all of their bodies, Devlin worked to scrape the ooze off them. He burned the scrapings in a wicker basket and then proceeded to burn the bodies of everyone inside the barracks. Before hanging himself the next day, Periscot's name and the names of the rest of the expedition crew would be recorded by Devlin in the last entry of his diary.</p>
<p>Two days later, Marpenoth 22 , a group of adventurers arrived to the island in search of Briella Farthing and investigated the ruined campsite. There they discovered the badly burnt corpse of Periscot still lying within the ruins of the camp's barracks.</p>
