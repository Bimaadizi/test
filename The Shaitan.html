<p>The Shaitan was a name given in the Desert of Desolation area of Raurin to bizarre, possibly magical storms.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Shaitan always moved west to east across the desert, and only occurred during daytime. Though it moved too fast to get out of the way effectively, it carried a miles-tall cloud which could be seen for an hour before it arrived, even at ground level. The air became cold for miles around the cloud, from which strong winds issued; it was difficult to see even a mile within five miles of it, and within two miles visibility was reduced to a hundred yards.</p>
<p>People caught within the Shaitan proper found that it had two forms: one of an acid storm, and one of a dust storm. Being inside the cloud during a dust storm, the most common kind, eliminated almost all visibility; acid storms were slightly less common and caused actual damage to flesh for up to ten minutes, requiring all people and livestock to take cover.</p>
