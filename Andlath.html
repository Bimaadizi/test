<p>Andlath was a lost human kingdom that stood in the Shining Plains of the Vilhon Reach a thousand years before the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Andlath's legacy was the Tethir Road , built between the Year of the Wailing Dryads, 230 DR (the year King King Dalagar "Longwalker" took the throne) and the Year of the Wandering Leucrotta, 239 DR . The road stretched from Athkatla in Amn to Ormath in the Shining Plains. Dalagar "Longwalker" attempted to unite South Faerûn through trade and expand Andlath's borders and influence. The tumultuous decade of building the road was filled with wars and strife caused by the project and attacks from elves and dwarves .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Leaping Centaur, 232 DR , Andlath lost control over its centaur slave population. Hearts of angry centaurs shattered the kingdom into a collection of scattered outposts and embattled besieged lands. King Dalagar personally helmed over forty battles in the course of a single year as the construction of the Tethir Road continued.</p>
<p>It was believed that Emperor Shoon IV of Calimshan was instrumental in the creation of the Tethir Road through magical means or political pressure.</p>
