<h2>History</h2>
<p>Niree oversaw the Temple of the Half-Moon in Elmwood as high priestess, and served Selûne as a werewolf of the New Moon Pact, fighting against her enemies with tooth and claw. In 757 DR , the High Moonmistress Brima Chintamn of Bright Lady's Tower in Chancelgaunt declared the New Moon Pact a heresy, and Niree was among those targeted. She was captured, taken to Chancelgaunt, and executed by the church of Selûne at Bright Lady's Tower, though her companion Halftail escaped.</p>
<p>When Feena Archwood investigated the mystery of the New Moon Pact in 1373 DR , Niree's spirit appeared in her dreams alongside the other members of the Pact to defend and guide her. After she uncovered Velsinore 's heresy and they mutually slew each other, Feena's spirit was met by a Shard escort to the afterlife, but the spirits of the Pact members encouraged her to return to life and join the New Moon Pact herself. With the aid of Julith Harkspur 's healing, Feena was revived and ultimately continued the legacy of the Pact.</p>
