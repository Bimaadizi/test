<p>The Blue Kumi Bandits were a group of bandits who plagued the Fochu Peninsula around 1358 DR .</p>
<p>They were originally a group of disaffected bushi of the city of Fochu . Without work, they turned to banditry, using a distinctive blue kumi (braid) dangling down their backs.</p>
<p>At last, they were defeated by the combined efforts of the heroine Oe-Ura and of Osari Minhiro and his foreign adventuring party.</p>
