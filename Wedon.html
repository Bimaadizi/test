<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Wedon portended death and destruction and were greatly feared by the peoples of Kara-Tur. Warning of their appearance in an area was often predicted by the sudden appearance of a flock of loons or sparrows . If the flock remained in the area or actively followed an individual, the appearance of a wedon was guaranteed. An individual who witnessed this was wise to seek out a priest and seek redemption from the gods.</p>
