<p>Teerac-on-Water was a village of goblins on a small lake between the Stonelands and Goblin Marches .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Teerac-on-Water consisted of a dense cluster of wooden buildings that spread out over the water, joined by numerous boats and barges. The goblins revered a powerful shaman who oversaw the construction of the wooden structures and boats.</p>
<p>Fish were harpooned from the lake, and fruits and vegetables were harvested from the shores of the lake, giving the goblins a far more varied diet than usual.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The village sat on a small island in the middle of a lake, which itself sat inside a crater located on the edge of the Stonelands and Goblin Marches.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The village was extremely defensible despite being out in the open, as the Teerac's boats were the only way to traverse the water, and it was guarded by tamed giant frogs . Tunnels beneath the island led to the discovery of the Underdark , as well as subterranean bugbears who allied with the village.</p>
