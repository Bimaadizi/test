<p>Redspawn firebelchers were stupid and destructive dragonspawn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Redspawn firebelchers were large, bulky quadrupeds about 12 ft (3.7 m) long, and weighing about 3,000 lb (1,400 kg). They were covered in bright red scales.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Redspawn firebelchers, true to their name, could spit fire up to 60 feet (18 meters) and were naturally immune to fire, as well as spells to cause sleep and paralysis. In contrast, they were vulnerable to the cold. Additionally, any other dragonspawn that were riding on or within 10 feet (3 meters) of a redspawn firebelcher also gained immunity to fire.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Redspawn firebelchers were dumb brutes that, when wild, preferred to live in volcanic regions. They could swim, and often did so in lava. Although lone individuals were not unheard of, firebelchers typically gathered in packs of three to twelve.</p>
<p>They were vicious, lazy carnivores who could consume as much as their own body weight in meat in a single meal. Due to their slow metabolism, a single such meal could sustain them for up to two years; however, their natural cruelty meant that they often killed more than they needed to.</p>
<p>Redspawn firebelcher females mated once every three years, typically in the middle of summer. Males fought for the privilege of mating in bloody but rarely fatal contests. After mating, the female laid a clutch of six to eight eggs, concealing the eggs under small rocks and debris and guarding them ferociously. The eggs were each about 25 pounds (11 kilograms) and a 1 foot (0.3 meters) in diameter. When they hatched, the baby firebelchers attacked and ate everything they could see, including their own siblings. Under normal circumstances, only one firebelcher in every clutch would survive.</p>
<p>Redspawn firebelchers were used by more intelligent and powerful dragonspawn, such as blackspawn raiders , redspawn arcanisses , and greenspawn sneaks , as mounts. Although useful in battle, firebelchers were fractious creatures and grew lethargic when not hungry.</p>
