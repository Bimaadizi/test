<p>The Five Silvers , also known as the Five Coins , was a circle of standing stones in central Amn that served as a holy pilgrimage site for the faithful of Waukeen .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The circle consisted of five oblong marble slabs set at odd angles in an inscrutable arrangement. When viewed at dawn from the King's Arch to the west or from Esmeltaran to the north, the bright reflections seemed to turn the slabs into an array of dazzling silver coins .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Five Silvers were found on the plains 5 miles (8 kilometers) east of Gambiton near the shore of Lake Esmel .</p>
