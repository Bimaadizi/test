<p>A flask was a small container for liquids, widely appreciated by anyone who need to securely store and transport small amounts of material. It was sibling to the smaller vial and larger bottle , though the terms were sometimes used interchangeably. Skins and canteens served a similar function, though usually just for water, while beakers were used for precise alchemical purposes.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>An idealized average flask could hold 1 pt (0.47 L) of liquid, and was secured with a stopper. The flask could be made from a variety of durable materials, including metals, ceramics , or glass , and had a flat base and a narrow neck. Flasks intended for being worn on the hip (usually containing beverages) were made with a curved shape that sat neatly against the body.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h2>Notable Flasks</h2>
<p>Magical flasks often contained things far removed from normal flask functionality, making opening one a risky proposition.</p>
