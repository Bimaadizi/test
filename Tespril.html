<p>Tespril was an apprentice of the Zhentarim wizard Gathlarue in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She had large, dark eyes. Her hair was long, but after her fight with Shandril, her face became disfigured and one half of her head lost most of its hair.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>

<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>When in camp, she entertained the guards.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>She snatched a ring of teleportation from Gathlarue before their encounter with Shandril Shessair .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She was younger than Mairara , her fellow apprentice under Gathlarue . Both apprentices were romantically involved with their master, and they had engaged in sadomasochism with her.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tespril accompanied Gathlarue and Mairara at Marsember when they joined the search for spellfire , hunting down Shandril Shessair. She formed part of her master's retinue, as they nightly scried on their quarry. Before the attack on Irondrake Rock , their scrying had her convinced that they were going to be destroyed by Shandril's spellfire as they met in battle, and she stole a ring from her mistress when the latter became stunned as Mirt , who was traveling with Shandril at the time, destroyed a gargoyle to which Gathlarue had magically linked herself. Tespril froze during the fight with Shandril.</p>
<p>She survived the fight by using the ring of teleportation she'd stolen from Gathlarue, though she became badly scarred. Later, she was debriefed regarding the encounter in a meeting with Fzoul Chembryl and Sarhthor of the Zhentarim . The mage slew her at the close of the meeting, on Fzoul's ambiguous direction.</p>
