<h2>History</h2>
<p>Svian's club belonged to a grim, stoic, and intimidating hero of the Tribe of the Elk, Svian, long before 1281 DR . The barbarian was known never to show emption, get excited, nor panic in combat. His battle tactics were simple: stand your ground and pulverize every opponent who approaches with Svian's club . Later in the hero's career, he was mortally wounded in battle. Without showing pain nor suffering, he simply sat down at a nearby rock and passed away. Several hours later, his tribesmen four the body. They never realized he was wounded and did not notice his passing until it was too late.</p>
<p>The barbarian was interred in one of the barrows of the Burial Isle . The club remained there as of 1281 DR, guarded by the spirits of Reghedmen ancestors and later that year, by disturbed undead .</p>
