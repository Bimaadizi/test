<p>A living unseen servant was an unseen servant that had been conjured as a living spell in an area effected by wild magic . They served their master unerringly, as a sort of over-eager manservant or chambermaid.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>While they were typically invisible in appearance, as per their name, the use of certain divination spells such as see invisibility or true seeing showed they had the form of a slender, adult humanoid .</p>
<p>As they were considered magical constructs, living servants were immune to poison , paralyzation , and petrification, and could not be rendered unconscious.</p>
