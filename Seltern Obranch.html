<p>Seltern Obranch was a druid of Silvanus that was within the city of Elturel when it made its descent into the Nine Hells in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Elturel was taken down to Avernus in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Seltern and other people in the city found refuge in the cathedral of High Hall . During the ordeal, Seltern created batches of goodberries to help keep himself and his fellow survivors alive.</p>
<p>Seltern unfortunately felt his connection to Silvanus waning, and did not believe he could continue casting divine magic . While he believed this a cause of being taken away from Toril , in truth his faith was badly shaken and he was no longer confident in his abilities.</p>
