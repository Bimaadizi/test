<p>Tentacle extensions were accessories that illithids wore on their tentacles.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When unattached, tentacle extensions looked like 3‑foot (0.91‑meter) long damp cables that often had extremely sharp blades on the ends . They were always in sets of four or six, which matched the number of tentacles possessed by mind flayers and ulitharids , respectively. When attached, if the illithid used its psionic energy , the cables would meld seamlessly into the illithid's tentacles.</p>
<h2>Function</h2>
<p>Tentacle extensions functioned much like normal illithid tentacles, only three feet longer. The flesh-dissolving enzyme on the tentacles spread to the tip of the extensions through a small duct. An illithid needed to continuously pour psionic energy into the extensions , as without the constant flow, they detached. Upon detachment, the extensions became inert for the next twelve hours. It was not possible for a mind flayer to wear them for over 2 hours without becoming fatigued .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The extensions made it easier for an illithid to hit a victim with its tentacles, and also caused them to deal more damage to the victim. The extensions did not impede an illithid's ability to withdraw the victims brain when four tentacles touched the skull.</p>
<h2>Users</h2>
<p>They were often supplied to illithid sentinels in major tunnels that led into Oryndoll .</p>
