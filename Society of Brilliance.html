<p>Lady Esther played a role in supplying and executing the tasks necessary for the society's research efforts. Among her tasks was the obtaining of a githyanki egg from the Rosymorn Monastery for Havkelaag 's researches on the nature of evil.</p>
<h2>Headquarters</h2>
<p>The society had a house called the Lodge of the Society of Brilliance in Lower City of Baldur's Gate . The place was used as a library, a dormitory, a museum and a warehouse at the same time.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As follows from the book An History of the Society of Brilliance as Told by Its Members , the Society of Brilliance was founded during a meeting between Omeluum , Grazilaxx , Blurg , Sloopidoop , Y , and Skriss . Since then the society continued to grow in numbers, but it still remained quite small in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR .</p>
<p>Some members went on a pilgrimage to Gravenhollow some years before era of events of the Second Sundering . In 1492 DR there was the Letter concerning Gravenhollow which could be found in the Lodge. The letter for Aenrahel was written by Dhunyl , a scholar who informed about his departure to study the knowledge of the library.</p>
<p>Some time around the Year of the Nether Mountain Scrolls, 1486 DR , members of the society began to investigate the faerzress of the Underdark, specifically its relation to reports about a "demonic incursion" from the depths of the Abyss .</p>
<p>The research notes from the book The Lost Tomb of Khaem chronicled numerous endeavors to discover the actual tomb over the course of the society's existence.</p>
<p>Within the society, individuals explored an array of subjects, some of which were unrelated to the Underdark. An unknown member of the Society of Brilliance spent time interviewing throat-singer Quil Grootslang to obtain information about the dragonborn society.</p>
<p>The society published the works of peers and applicants for membership making edits and additions before publishing. Among those works was the thesis called Study on the Representation of Deep Gnomes in Mid-Century Drow Literature .</p>
<p>Amidst the Absolute crisis , the Society of Brilliance faced threats from inhabitants of Baldur's Gate, driven by escalating panic and xenophobia, particularly because of the presence of illithids among the society's members.</p>
