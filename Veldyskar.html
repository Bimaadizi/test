<p>Veldyskar was an intelligent basilisk living in Gravenhollow in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A stone giant visitor to Gravenhollow donated Veldyskar to the keepers of the library to act as a guardian and general-purpose helper countless years before the 1480s DR.</p>
<p>Circa 1486 DR , the basilisk met an expedition led by some adventurers , who'd been hired by Bruenor Battlehammer to investigate the threat of a demon lord , at the gate of Gravenhollow.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Veldyskar's philosophy during fights was to petrify first and ask questions later. To avoid problems, the keepers taught him how to cast a greater restoration spell.</p>
