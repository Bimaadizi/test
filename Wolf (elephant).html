<p>Wolf was an elephant that lived in the Kingdom of Mertwig around the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When King Mertwig was on the verge of death at age 65, various fortune hunters and individuals claiming to be his long-lost heirs scoured his kingdom in search of wealth and treasure. During their journey to claim the throne, some of the would-be heirs of King Mertwig paid 16 gold pieces for Wolf to accompany them on their adventure. Those who did sometimes abandoned Wolf when faced with a difficult situation, leaving him behind to act as a distraction and eventually find his way into the services of other would-be heirs to the kingdom.</p>
