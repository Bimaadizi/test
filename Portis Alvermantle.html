On the way home along the Hullack Trail he stopped at the Journey's Rest inn during a storm, only to intuit something was terribly wrong despite the friendly atmosphere provided by the beautiful innkeepers Ryanna and Moria . Though he did not know precisely what the danger was, he packed up and left that night despite the weather. This saved him from being devoured by innkeepers, who were both secretly vampires .</p>
