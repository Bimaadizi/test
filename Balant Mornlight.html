<p>Balant Mornlight was a halfling fighter adventurer of infamous ill luck, active in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Balant hailed from a tiny hamlet just outside the town of Whitehorn in the White Peaks of the Moonsea North . Ever since he was a child, Balant was prone to legendarily bad luck. He accidentally burned his hamlet to the ground while still a kid, ensuring it disappeared from the 14 th century maps. His adventuring career was mostly uneventful. Balant's most grievous wound came from him once running headfirst into a tree while fleeing from his paramour's scorned partner. Another adventure of note was when Balant Mornlight traveled with a caravan through a desert. The halfling's bad luck was so immense, the caravan faced a freak thunderstorm tuned flood. The caravan's destruction ended Balant's employment with it. By the time the halfling fighter reached the age of 51, he was believed to be a jinx by most.</p>
<p>Sometime in the 14 th century DR, Balant Mornlight was among ambitions adventurers who was interested in being sent to a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed sorceress to retrieve the equally mysterious magical orb from its depths.</p>
