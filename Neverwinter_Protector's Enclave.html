<p>The Protector's Enclave was one of the districts of Neverwinter , named after Dagult Neverember , the Lord Protector of the city.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Most of the original buildings of this district were left unscathed after the destruction of the city. As such, the Protector's Enclave was the only part of Neverwinter that looked like it did in its old days.</p>
<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>The city's market, where all commerce in Neverwinter took place, was located in the Protector's Enclave. Merchants from Waterdeep and other cities of the Sword Coast had to pay high taxes to sell their wares here.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Besides Lord Neverember and his underlings, the Protector's Enclave was inhabited by survivors of the cataclysm as well as immigrants who took up residence in the city after its recovery. Most of the inhabitants of the Protector's Enclave were staunch supporters of Neverember's rule.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Protector's Enclave was originally known as the Merchant Quarter of Neverwinter. This district in turn was part of other two different districts: the City Core and the Peninsula District . Both were heavily damaged during the war against Luskan . The damaged parts were rebuilt as a different district.</p>
<p>Long before the 14 th century DR, two children were buried under the city watch in the Merchant Quarter. Their invisible ghosts became known to run around the area, endlessly playing a game of tag. Local superstition claimed that those who came across the ghostly children were paralyzed by fright. In the Year of the Helm, 1362 DR , the adventure troupe led by Francis the All-Seeing , famously, banished the kids' ghosts by exhuming the children's bodies and performing a sanctified burial ceremony. It was never discovered how the dead children ended up being buried under the city watch.</p>
<p>When the Spellplague of 1385 DR struck Neverwinter, the lands surrounding the Moonstone Mask became an earthmote .</p>
<p>When Mount Hotenow erupted in 1451 DR , bringing about the destruction of most of Neverwinter, the southwestern part of the city was left mostly untouched by the pyroclastic flow. This made this quadrant a suitable place for survivors to establish their Settlers' Enclave . It thus also became the primary target for Lord Neverember when he began his efforts to rebuild Neverwinter. He later fused the City Core, the Peninsula District and the Merchant Quarter into only one area. Soon after, survivors of the cataclysm, as well as new immigrants began to quickly repopulate the district.</p>
<p>As the seat of power of Neverember, the district was soon renamed the "Protector's Enclave" by the people.</p>
