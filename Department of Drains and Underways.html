Orin the Red , the crazed Chosen of the Lord of Murder, and her doppelgangers performed ritualistic murders of Baldurians, using as a base their so-called Tribunal, deep under the Lower City. Gohumberry Tresp of the Lower City grew suspicious of the rising stench of death that emanated from the City Sewers' drains and hatches. Gohumberry began investigating the scandalous issue and petitioned the Department of Drains and Underways for a resolution to the problem. The Department claimed to be handling the problem and sternly warned Gohumberry away from attempting to enter the Underways on his own.</p>
