<p>Lightning golems were a type of greater golem .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lightning golems were humanoid in shape and made from gold . Their movements were the same as a regular humanoid. Crackling electrical discharges were constantly present around its body.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Lightning golems had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of the chain lightning spell, able to lash out with electricity to a target within 50 yd (46 m). It was immune to most spells that affected living creatures as well as psionics. It was also immune to cold, electrical, ice, lightning and mind-based effects and spells. It remained vulnerable to effects and spells which targeted metals, as well as heat.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Lightning golems used their powerful arms to smash a target. Any opponent who came into physical contact with a lightning golem received a vicious electrical shock.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Only the most powerful wizard could create a lightning golem. It was an extremely expensive process. The body of a lightning golem required 2,000 lb (910 kg) of gold alone, and the cost of the gold and the other materials required could cost up to 150,000 gp . Constructing the body took up to ten weeks. The wizard then had to infuse the body with an elemental spirit. This required the wizard to cast chain lightning , enchant an item , geas , permanency and wish spells, all in an open location during a fierce storm. If successful, a massive bolt of lightning struck the golem's body, infusing it with a powerful elemental spirit.</p>
