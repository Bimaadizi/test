<p>Jezgar Skentzin was a seawolf pirate in the Pirate Isles in 1359 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Jezgar was an audacious pirate with a very bloody approach. His raids were well known for the high death toll both among his victims and his own crew. In time, only the most bloodthirsty pirates joined his crew.</p>
<p>However, Jezgar had a secret: one day, he had saved a shipwreck victim who turned out to be a seawolf. Jezgar killed him but not before he infected Jezgar and his crew. From that day on, they were seawolf pirates. However, they hid their secret very well and nobody realized that they now sought blood rather than booty. During day, Jezgar and his men visited pirate harbors but always sailed out before night.</p>
