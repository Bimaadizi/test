<p>Tower Threespires was an overgrown wizard tower in the eastern edge of the Dunwood in the Great Dale .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>At a distance, this ruined wizards tower looked like a giant three-fingered hand reaching out of the Dunwood towards the sky. The three towers stabbed out from a broad-based construction of stone, which would've collapsed many years previously if not held together by a great network of vines wrapping themselves around every inch of the three towers. Were the vines to wither and lose their cohesion, the entire tower complex would come crashing down. The peak of the north tower contained a portal to Clymph Tower .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Nar demonbinder Clymph built this tower in the Year of the Burning Tree, 890 DR , two years after creating his fortress of Clymph Tower. He linked the two by a permanent portal , making this the only way to enter or leave the sealed Clymph Tower.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR , the tower was inhabited by a small group of druids , all descendants of those chosen personally by the Nentyarch leader of the Circle of Leth , to be part of a special order of guardians several centuries earlier. They were to protect the lands and forests against the demons held in Clymph Tower. Every year on the Feast of the Moon , they performed a ritual to maintain the portal seal, preventing any trapped demon from slipping out into the Great Dale. While the druids were no longer sure if the ritual was necessary or whether any demons still lingered in Clymph Tower, they nonetheless still performed their appointed task of securing the Tower and Portal both.</p>
<p>Long isolation had made the druids suspicious of strangers, never allowing anyone else to enter the tower, no matter how dire the situation, in fear of the portal unsealing and thus their duty to fail.</p>
