<p>Oils were a wide range of natural and artificial liquid substances found in the Realms , closely related to resins and pitches . The many different varieties were often referred to simply as "oil", whether used as a lubricant, cooking oil, or lamp fuel.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lamp oil was a cheap and common form of fuel, which usually came in 1‑pint (470‑milliliter) clay flasks. This amount was sufficient to light most lamps and lanterns for about 6 hours. As it was reliably flammable, lamp oil could be used in an emergency as a weapon to set enemies aflame.</p>
<h2>Natural Oil</h2>
<h3>Animal Oil</h3>
<p>Some oils could be extracted from animal fats , with sea creatures especially common in this regard.</p>
<h3>Mineral Oil</h3>
<p>Though rare, oil could be derived from minerals.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Oil</h3>
<p>Most oils came from various plants. These vegetable oils were widely used in crafting, alchemy, and cooking.</p>
<h2>Crafted Oil</h2>
<h3>Alchemical Oil</h3>
<p>Some oils were made by alchemists through involved processes, but weren't necessarily of magical nature.</p>
<h3>Magical Oil</h3>
<p>Magical oils functioned similar to potions , but instead of being quaffed they were poured, smeared, or splashed over a person or object in order to imbue the effects.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Extremely flammable aromatic oil flowed through fountains in the Temple-Under-the-Sea , located in the Fiddler's Green region of the Sea of Swords . The oil's sweetly sticky saccharine aroma permeated the temple's upper chambers and was used for ceremonial purposes.</p>
