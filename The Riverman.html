<p>The Riverman was an old inn found in the village of Blackfeather Bridge in Featherdale in the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This popular inn lay sprawled across the north bank of the River Ashaba spread for about a quarter of a mile. The haphazard arrangement of the many buildings made them seem randomly connected to each other versus being a single continuous structure. This was a result of the forced growth from the inn's popularity.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Joyous music, great food, and cozy warm beds could be found at the Riverman. Favorite dishes included buttered toast with mushrooms and oysters and baked bean and goose pie. Guests were warned to not unleash magic on the premises. Many of the walls had sound-deadening and fire prevention spells .</p>
<p>A bed at the Riverman cost 7 sp per night or 9 if one wanted a private room. Meals were only 2 cp for as much as one could eat, and drinks were 5 cp per serving. The wine list was quite lacking and most guests chose the ale .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>A ghost named Albrent haunted the inn, but not in a menacing way. Albrent protected the inn from fire and thieves, and occasionally offered advice to those in need.</p>
