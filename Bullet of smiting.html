<p>Bullets of smiting were heavy enchanted sling missiles that dealt powerful bludgeoning damage to the targets.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Bullets of smiting were significantly more dense and heavier than regular sling missiles. When one such bullet was launched out of a sling, it accumulated extra weight, gaining greater velocity, smashing into the target as if it were smashed with a mace .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These bullets received common use across northwest Faer√ªn and the city of Neverwinter by the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . And by the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , bullets of smiting were crafted by the dwarves of Kelvin's Cairn in Icewind Dale .</p>
