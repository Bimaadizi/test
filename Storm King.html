<p>The Storm King was the most valuable warlord of the Yikarian Empire in 1367 DR , and served as the Lotus Emperor's right hand.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Storm King acted as the Emperor's adviser, general, and executioner, and was even a potential successor to the throne. Contrary to others to hold his position in the past, the Storm King appeared content to serve the Emperor without attempting to hurry along his demise. Tamalynda , the Whisperer, spread ideas that the Storm King's lack of ambition was a fault in any potential leader, but the Storm King calmly ignored these attacks, which made her extremely nervous.</p>
