<p>A ring of X-ray vision was a magic ring that allowed its wearer to temporarily see through solid objects.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Upon speaking the ring's command word, its wearer became capable of perceiving several different solid materials as transparent. In fact, the wearer was able to see as if light itself could penetrate the solid barrier in every direction. This power worked for up to 1 minute out to a range of 30 feet (9.1 meters). Vision in this way could penetrate up to 3 feet (91 centimeters) of wood or dirt, 1 foot (30 centimeters) of stone or up to 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) of regular metals, but no further. A thin sheet of lead was sufficient to completely block the ring's power.</p>
<p>Using the power of a ring of X-ray vision more than roughly once a day was extremely taxing. It was recommended to only use the ring's power again after resting the equivalent of a full night's sleep.</p>
