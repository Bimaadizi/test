<p>The hat of difference was a type of magical chapeau that allowed its wearer to change their profession in life.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Whoever wore the hat was granted the ability to switch their profession to anything they desired, such as a fighter becoming a cleric . They would gain all the associated skills and abilities such a change would entail, but any advances the wearer made were cumulative and would only manifest whilst wearing the hat.</p>
<p>All experience that the wearer accumulated within the hat would be lost if it was ever discarded, lost, stolen, or not within a 1 mi (1,600 m) radius of them for any twenty four hour period.</p>
<h2>Notable Hats</h2>
<p>At some point an adventurer wearing one of these hats traversed the caverns of Deepearth and met his end at the hands of a neo-otyugh .</p>
<p>Howard Holiday owned such a hat, a broad-brimmed garment with a hippogriff feather.</p>
