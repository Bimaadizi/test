<p>Jamie was the son of Elizabeth Clawthorn , an inhabitant of the town of Ghars in Cormyr in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Jasper met with the elderly Elizabeth in 1367 DR , she mistook him for Jamie. Though Jasper did not know who or where Jamie was, he played the role somewhat for her benefit. Liz recalled Jamie was a good son, and as a boy he swung on a rope hanging from a tree his father later had to cut down.</p>
