<p>Wulgreth of Ascalhorn was the Banite wizard who was responsible for the destruction of two great kingdoms, and the formation of Hellgate Keep in the 9 th century DR . He continued his existence as a lich for many centuries afterwards, a twisted undead monster obsessed with revenge and self-preservation at any cost.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>When he was a mortal, Wulgreth was considered to be a spellcaster of middling to average ability.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>During his years of undeath, Wulgreth haunted the ruins of Karse and the surrounding Dire Wood .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>His phylactery was the artifact known as the Karsestone , which was taken from its place within the Karsus Butte and placed in the hands of the goddess of darkness, Shar .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Wulgreth had an unfortunate and fractured relationship with his man-at-arms Jingleshod . While he served as the wizard's loyal servant for sixty years, Jingleshod remained silent for years about the atrocities Wulgreth brought onto the Realms. All that accumulated guilt grew within Jingleshod until the climactic moment when he betrayed his master.</p>
<p>Having both survived the ordeal and each enduring a twisted form of undeath , Wulgreth and Jingleshod continued as mutual predator and prey; first as the wizard sought to and successfully killed his servent, then as Jingleshod sought to destroy the lich Wulgreth to end his own existence.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Quite fittingly, Wulgreth of Ascalhorn was named for the ancient arcanist Wulgreth of Netheril .</p>
<p>During the 9 th century DR, in the Year of the Roving Tyrant, 820 DR , Wulgreth forewent the agreement his ancestors made with the elves of Eaerlann and enlisted the aid of baatezu in order gain the upper hand against his rivals. After sixty years of superiority, his rivals summoned the aid of tanar'ri for their own defense. In the Year of the Curse, 882 DR , the demonic horde finally managed to overcome baatezu legions. They destroyed the keep of Ascalhorn, before overwhelming both Eaerlann and the dwarven kingdom of Ammarindar .</p>
<p>Some sixty years later in the Year of the Giant's Oath, 883 DR , Wulgreth fled the fortress Ascalhorn (which later came to be known as Hellgate Keep) with his man-at-arms Jingleshod and made for the ruins of Karse . While there he sought to access the lingering power of the dead arcanist Karsus in order to raise an undead army to wipe out the demons which he was responsible for. While in the middle of casting his spell , Wulgreth was finally put to an end by Jingleshod. The arcane energies burst forth, transforming Wulgreth into a lich and creating the Dire Wood forest.</p>
<p>To claim his vengeance upon Jingleshod, Wulgreth hunted him down and tortured him to death. Similar to Wulgreth, Jingleshod arose as an undead monstrosity, albeit a rather unique iteration.</p>
<p>The conflict between the two came to a second bitter climax on Nightal 30 in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR . As Jingleshod formed an agreement with a band of adventurers that included the shadow mage Melegaunt Tanthul and Galaeron Nihmedu , Wulgreth remained hidden in the Shrine of the Undying Heart within Karsus Butte. When Jingleshod and the outlanders traveled within, Wulgreth leapt down from the Karsestone and defended the artifact from the intruders. The lich and his former servant fought a vicious battle for some time. Wulgreth killed the mage Melegaunt in the process, but was finally decapitated by the shadow adept Galaeron.</p>
<p>As his phylactery was not destroyed, Wulgreth's essence remained tethered to the Realms through the Karsestone. Moments after his beheading, the body of the lich started to reform and was left for the phaerimm descending upon the Karsus Butte.</p>
