<p>Lukas was a human ranger and ship captain active in the Moonshae Isles as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was tall and gawky with dark hair and blue eyes.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Lukas had a strong and old-fashioned sense of honor, and always strove to keep his promises to his allies. He presented himself as nonchalant and uncaring, although in truth he was motivated to help others, especially his friends and those in need. He was quick to throw himself into danger, a trait which made him prone to making terrible mistakes but, at the same time, endearing him to others for his boldness.</p>
<p>He hated orcs and mistrusted drow .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He was a skilled tracker and was said to be able to recognize any animal by its smell. He had a deep knowledge of the Moonshae Isles, and knew the true secrets behind many of its rumors.</p>
<p>He was a talented player of the the violoncello .</p>
<p>In combat, he favored the longbow , and was a keen marksman. He was also a formidable swordsman . In either case, he favored aiming for the heads of his enemies.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Prior to it sinking, he cared deeply about his ship, the Sphinx , although he cared more about his crew, and was willing to sacrifice the whole ship if it meant saving a single crewmate. Lukas's closest comrade was the genasi Gaspar-shen , who frequently exasperated Lukas with his roundabout and pastry -themed way of speaking. He cared greatly for the gnome Suka , but also trusted her to look out for herself. His impression of the Savage was as an unflappably calm and reliable swordsman. He had brought Marikke and Kip aboard to save them from poverty.</p>
<p>After meeting Lady Amaranth of the le Shay , he soon began to fall in love with her, although she left him after she returned to Sarifal .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lukas was the eldest son of a wealthy man in Loudwater , but was disowned and forced to flee after sleeping with his father's much younger third wife. He ultimately arrived in Baldur's Gate , where he personally built the Sphinx using borrowed funds. In the following years, he sailed all around the Trackless Sea and the Moonshae Isles, sometimes working for the Amnians of Snowdown and other times doing jobs for Callidyrr on Alaron . Everything he owned was stored on or invested in the Sphinx , and his many years of travelling earned him a great deal of knowledge about the Moonshae Isles (and from speaking to other sailors, like Captain Blau ). However, he had never set foot on either Moray or Oman's Isle , considering them to be too dangerous or even cursed .</p>
<p>In the late 1470s DR, in order to satisfy the Savage's debts to the Kingdom of Callidyrr , Lukas accepted a job to escort Lord Aldon Kendrick to the ruins of Caer Corwell in Sarifal. He and his crew were greeted there by High Lady Ordalf , the ruler of Sarifal, who killed Aldon, imprisoned Suka, and tasked Lukas to kill her half-sister, Lady Amaranth, who led a group of lycanthropes on the island of Moray. Lukas recognized that his party stood no chance against the powerful queen, but negotiated pay for the mission, receiving 300 gold pieces up front with a promise of an equal amount upon their successful return.</p>
<p>Despite knowing stories of the danger in the waters around Moray, Lukas sailed directly into the domain of fire nagas , which sank the Sphinx and scattered his crew. He was saved from drowning by Gaspar-shen, and the pair set out to track their remaining allies, who had been abducted by lycanthropes following their arrival on Moray. However, as the lycanthropes' tracks scattered, Lukas realized that he had followed the wrong group and had lost the trail of his friends. Instead, he and Gaspar-shen came across a raiding party of orcs assaulting their human captives, and at Lukas's insistence, they ambushed the orcs. They slew many before both of them were injured, and they were only saved by the intervention of Lady Amaranth and her followers, whom they had accidentally found. Brought to her base at Caer Moray to recover, Amaranth was intrigued by Lukas's heroism (despite his attempts to downplay his good intentions) as well as his musical ability, and the two developed a mutual interest. When Caer Moray came under attack by the Black Blood tribe , they shared a kiss as the siege reached its more dire point.</p>
<p>After the Battle of Caer Moray was ended by the divine intervention of Chauntea , Lukas, Gaspar-shen, and Amaranth followed signs sent by Chauntea that promised to return them to Sarifal by way of a portal in the Breasal Marsh . Lukas attempted to steer the group toward tracking down his missing crew, but Chauntea intervened. They arrived at the portal with the Black Blood and an aspect of Malar on their heels, where they encountered the Savage and his new lover, Eleuthra Davos , just in time to witness the Savage's last stand as the rest were pulled through the portal to Citadel Umbra . There, amidst a festival held by High Lady Ordalf's son, Prince Araithe , Lukas learned from Eleuthra of the fates of Kip and Marikke as well as of the Savage's true nature . He also was resigned to leave Amaranth with her nephew to attempt a rescue of Suka when High Lady Ordalf arrived, humiliated Amaranth, and caused a physical alteration with her son. As the festival goers scattered, Lukas fled with Amaranth and Gaspar-shen into the Underdark with Amaka , a drow priestess of Araushnee who promised to take them south toward Synnoria where Amaranth would find supporters against her family members and Lukas could then continue back to Caer Corwell to save Suka. Instead, Amaka led them into a trap. After being captured by drow who intended to sacrifice Amaranth, they again encountered Amaka, who revealed herself to be an avatar of Araushnee before freeing them and whispering words of advice to Amaranth. With that advice, Amaranth resolved to abandon Lukas, whose mortal lifespan she now realized made him far too inconsequential in her life's story, although the pair shared a passionate final kiss before she disappeared.</p>
<p>Lukas and Gaspar-shen were reunited by chance with Suka just before Amaranth left to parlay with Prince Araithe to secure their safe escape from Sarifal. The three left together by boat shortly thereafter. According to a vision granted to Gaspar-shen by Araushnee, they would soon find themselves sailing to somewhere across the Sea of Swords .</p>
