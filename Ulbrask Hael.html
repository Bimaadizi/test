<p>Ulbrask Hael was a human crafter and wheelwright in Khôltar , south Faerûn , who lived during the 4 th century, DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Bitter Smile, 368 DR , Khôltar was still a nascent city making the transition from a well-guarded tent encampment to a permanent settlement—construction on a new wall and a new road had begun just two years prior. At this time, Ulbrask Hael invented a new design for a heavy wagon; one that could carry great loads over long distances with less frequent need for repairs. And when one of his wagons did need repair, it could be fixed rapidly with interchangeable spare parts. Demand for Hael's wagons quickly outstripped supply, but as more of them rolled out, trade increased dramatically, fortunes were made, and the former tent city became a permanent trade hub in the region.</p>
<p>In honor of his great contribution to the prosperity of the Iron City, the main thoroughfare Hael Way was named after him.</p>
