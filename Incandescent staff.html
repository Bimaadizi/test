<p>Incandescent staff was a type of enchanted quarterstaff imbued with the elemental magics of fire.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The entire length of an incandescent staff was etched with the Primordial script of fire that coursed with fire-red radiance.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These very rare magical weapons possessed a +1 enchantment to their aim and damage that allowed the wielder to use it with the same efficiency against creatures typically resistant to bludgeoning or non-magical damage. An incandescent staff also granted them resistance to magical and mundane flame and improved their spellcasting aim. Lastly, the wielder could cast the fire bolt cantrip at will and the fireball spell once per day, using the staff's magic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , one such staff was in stock of Talli , a Harper quartermaster who followed the druid Harper hero Jaheira into the Shadow-cursed Lands in the Western Heartlands .</p>
