<p>Sumitomo Yoichi , also known as Ono Arieki , was a yakuza ninja and the former heir of the Doi No Fugu (Inn of the Globefish) in Maeshi Province , Kozakura , circa Kozakuran Year 1433 (1359 DR) .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Yoichi was the eldest son of Sumitomo Koji , master of Doi No Fugu, and of Haru . His siblings were Skoshi , Toyo , Miko , and Myoki .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As the eldest son, Yoichi was destined to inherit the inn and the position of master chef, as was Sumitomo family tradition. However, Yoichi was seen as an odd boy by his family, as a dreamer and separate from his siblings, though still strong, ready to help out, and devoted his sisters and brother. He always dreamed of adventures, battles, and warriors and was fascinated by the stories of travelers who stayed at the inn, which he then told to his younger siblings, Toyo and Skoshi. At age 10, he carved a wooden katana to practice with. He had little interest in cooking or running an inn, but his father Koji assumed this would pass as he grew older. He lived there for about two decades.</p>
<p>When Koji decided, as family tradition dictated, to send Yoichi away for to train as an apprentice chef and learn new culinary techniques around Kozakuran Year 1426 (1352 DR) , Yoichi traveled to another city to the south in Kozakura. This was meant to last five years. He sent letters home for six months, then he disappeared and the head chef there reported him missing. Yoichi's family had no word of him for the next seven years, in which time Toyo took his brother's place as successor.</p>
<p>In fact, Yoichi had simply walked out of the inn where he worked and abandoned his apprenticeship, going instead to the headquarters of the Ono Kumi yakuza ninja clan in search of the adventure that he'd always dreamed about. He joined the clan, taking its name as his own and becoming Ono Arieki. He served his oyabun well, in time being promoted to a trusted henchmen. The clan became his new family.</p>
<p>Then, in Kozakuran Year 1433 (1359 DR) , his boss Ono Noburo chose him for a special mission: to go back to the Doi No Fugu in Maeshi and to seize control of the place he knew so well. Once he'd done so, he would call in a second group and take the Seven Swords from a visiting adventuring party that would shortly arrive. Noburo told him that none of the Sumitomos were to be harmed, and Yoichi, although disturbed, reluctantly accept. Unbeknownst to him, Noburo ordered Yoichi's lieutenant, Ono Chomei to kill all the people inside the inn in order to cover their trail, and Yoichi too if he caused trouble.</p>
<p>That summer, Yoichi led six men of Ono Kumi to the Inn of the Globefish, posing as a traveling merchant and his retainers, guards, and servants; Yoichi wore a mask and claimed to have a cold to avoid being recognized by his family. They rented a room for the night and asked for a meal and a party with companions, during which they quickly surprised and subdued the Sumitomo family, imprisoning them in their own secret chamber, which gave Koichi away to his parents. They kept the women hostage there to ensure Koji's and Toyo's cooperation and Skoshi and Kinnori stayed confined in their rooms. Fourteen more ninja lay in wait outside.</p>
<p>When the adventurers with the relics finally arrived, the villains posed as the inn staff and welcomed them in, though male ninja made for poor geisha girls. They planned to distract them with a banquet at which they even performed " The Reward of Tomy ", lull them with a biwa of calm and pearl of persuasion , and even have one of their number, a shukenja named Toshiro mislead them by prophesying an ambush after leaving the inn, before ambushing them with thrown shuriken and poison -gas eggshell grenades and attacking. This would be complicated by the Sumitomo family's attempts to escape and alert the adventurers, the guard Haka Kinnori seizing the chance to strike back, and Yoichi's own crisis of conscience, which would be triggered if he was forced to fight his own family or saw them harmed or even killed, and he would potentially switch sides. The exact outcome of this terrible situation is unknown and the fate of the Sumitomos and others involved is unknown, but Michimori Uemon ultimately received the relics he'd employed the adventurers to recover.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like other members of the Ono Kumi, Yoichi was trained in the Smiling Viper martial arts style, knowing pain touch and stunning touch attacks. He was also specialized in the ninja-to .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He wore leather armor beneath his clothes and wielded an unbreakable ninja-to of quality and a mariki-gusari , and had concealed a uchi-ne knife, three star-shaped shuriken , and a bag of ten tetsu-bishi .</p>
