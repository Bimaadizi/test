<p>Beastmen were humanoids creatures roughly similarly to short and slender humans, but covered in a green-coloured fur.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ordinary beastmen were on the smaller side, around 5 ft (1.5 m) in height. They had two layers of fur, an outer layer of green and an inner of black, as they move the inner black layer instinctively raises and sags, creating patterns in their fur which gives them a natural camouflage in foliage.</p>
<p>Skillful hunters, the beastmen were well adapted to survival in their forests, themselves only hunted by the most cunning and powerful creatures. Although omnivores, they themselves practiced no form of agriculture.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Due to their natural camouflaging fur they seldom wore clothing or ornamentation of any sort. Their native language was quite intricate, and involved spoken elements, facial expressions, gestures, and changes in their fur-patterns. Thus while non-beastmen could learn the words, expressions, and gestures, they would still be unable to truly communicate without somehow reproducing the color changes. For the beastmen this also means that all other languages they may learn seem simple and even primitive, and gives them a sense of superiority above other speakers.</p>
<p>Most beastmen did not believe in things they could not see, hear, or touch. Some sages claimed that this was due to the beastmen's innate magical resistance.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Their natural ability to camouflage themselves were a prime focus in most combats involving beastmen. They would attempt to remain undetected, blending in to the foliage and then ambush their enemies. Their natural magic resistance made them dangerous opponents for those who relied on it to make war. The beastmen themselves employed a variety of spears , stone axes , knives , bolas , and blowguns , creating a special toxin they smeared on their weapons and shot from their blowguns. This poison could kill those hit in very short time, but were somewhat easier to resist than many other poisons.</p>
<p>Sometimes they would take prisoners rather than outright kill their foes, and during these times they would drop large weighted nets woven from vines and creepers down on their opponents. Those captured would be stripped of all possessions and then released far from the tribe, if however the beastmen thought those captured would continued to be a threat, they would instead put them to a painless death.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>The beastmen tribes usually consisted of 40 to 60 members, and would avoid most contact with outsiders. Each tribe was led by a chieftain who, instead of being elected, appointed or inherited, would simply adopt the position as needed. This meant that the chieftain would be a different beastman most days, and change as the situation warranted. If the tribe was a war, the best warrior would be chief, and if multiple individuals were suited, a competition would take place to decide the days leader. This system only worked due to the fact that it was not considered an honor to be the chief, instead being a duty that would be placed upon one's shoulders from time to time. Likewise there were no shame in never being chief, or losing a competition for the leadership spot.</p>
<p>The beastmen tribes did not discriminate against either sex, except refusing pregnant woman from participating in strenuous activities, like combat. The young was raised communally, and at any one time around 1-in-10 beastmen would be children.</p>
<p>Beastmen lived in tree-houses woven from the living branches of the forest canopy, with 3-6 adult individuals to a house. These groups was a single marriage group, and usually there would be one or two children along with the adults in such a group.</p>
<p>Beastmen tribes had little that other cultures considered worth trading for, their culture was self-sustaining and they had no need for outside trade.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Year of the Shield, 1367 DR in Daggerdale , an old dwarven outpost and watchtower called The Eagle's Eyrie , was inhabited by a pair of beastmen and their hunting eagles .</p>
