<p>The amulet of joy and sorrow allowed one to commune with the dead.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The amulet consisted of a silver-colored chain and a blue gem embedded in a silver front-piece. When worn, it allowed the wearer to grant the semblance of life (as well as intelligence) onto a corpse. However, this only worked on corpses that had mouths, and could not be used on those already undead .</p>
