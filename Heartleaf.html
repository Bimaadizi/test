<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Due to the loss she suffered, Heartleaf was too weak to travel far from her solitary tree. Heartleaf exhibited a cautious optimism about the possible future of dryads once again dwelling within her home forest.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>After Mount Hotenow erupted in the Year of Knowledge Unearthed, 1451 DR , nearly the entire forest at the base of the volcanic was burn to ash. All that was left of these trees, and the dryads that lived within them, were their seeds.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Heartleaf work with the dwarven geologist named Darney , along with the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge to recover these seeds from what came to be known as the Charred Wood . They were able to pack these seeds within a form of "elemental clay", taken from a type of elemental known as flamespikers within the nearby volcanic caverns. The adventurer then helped Heartleaf replant the clay-packed seeds along the slopes of Mount Hotenow.</p>
