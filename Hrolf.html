<p>Hrolf the Unruly was a human captain of the Ruathen pirate ship Elfmaid .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The captain was a large, broad-shouldered man with skin tanned by the sun and wind. His extremely light-colored braided hair was streaked through with light gray. He had blue eyes, a large mustache, and a beard.</p>
<p>He apparently had a terrible singing voice.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1361 DR , he was imprisoned in Skullport but he escaped from jail with the help of Liriel Baenre .</p>
<p>Hrolf was killed as part of a conspiracy against Ruathym in 1361 DR . His funeral consisted of a large ceremony featuring a funeral bonfire intended to send him and the Elfmaid into the halls of Tempus . In honor of him, Liriel changed the figurehead of the Elfmaid into a figure of Hrolf.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h3>Moira</h3>
<p>Moira was Hrolf's wife. She was short and stout with gray eyes and red cheeks and lived alone on Tetris , a small island in the Moonshaes . She and Hrolf only ever saw each other during his brief stops there, but that suited them both just fine.</p>
<h3>Xzorsh</h3>
<p>When the sea elf Xzorsh was a child, Hrolf saved his life. He pledged to always protect the Elfmaid and her crew, usually by following it. Hrolf's relationship with Xzorsh was revelatory of Hrolf's particular care for elves .</p>
<h3>Liriel Baenre</h3>
<p>Not long after Liriel Baenre freed Hrolf from prison in Skullport and joined his crew in 1361 DR , the two began developing a close relationship. In Ruathym, Liriel stayed with Hrolf at his house and viewed him as a father, as he viewed her as a daughter. She greatly mourned his death.</p>
