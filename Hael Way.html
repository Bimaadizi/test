<p>Hael Way was a main thoroughfare in the city of Khôltar in south Faerûn , circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hael Way was three times as wide as a typical street in Khôltar and paved with cobblestones. It connected the south gate (named Farrgaunlar) to the west gate (named Dubrinlar) and was one leg of the triangle of roads connecting all three city gates. Hael Way intersected with the North Way at Farrgaunlar, and with Orntathtar Way at Dubrinlar.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This street was named after Ulbrask Hael who, in the Year of the Bitter Smile, 368 DR , designed a new heavy wagon that was strong, durable, and easily repairable. This invention catapulted the city into prominent status as a major trade center. The final gates of Khôltar were constructed during the tenure of Shieldlord Angloam Dubrin ( Year of the Alabaster Mounds, 577 DR , to the Year of Orcsfall, 619 DR ) so Hael Way was also completed during this period.</p>
