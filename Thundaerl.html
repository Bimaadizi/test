<p>Some time around 1367 DR , Elminster Aumar came across Thundaerl in the week before meeting with Mordenkainen and learned of his latest spell. Mordenkainen mentioned the Circle of Eight had paid him a visit once whilst in magical disguise; he described the pastries the man made as "excellent". Elminster mentioned Thundaerl had grown quite rich over the last dozen years in Selgaunt and devised a spell that revealed poison, Thundaerl's universal taster .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Thundaerl returned to Tethyr, trying to take the post as the palace chef, but came into conflict with the current chef, Gisbertus . Thundaerl eventually became chef of the Great Hall, where he was in charge of feasts rather than day-to-day matters.</p>
