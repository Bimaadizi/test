<p>Vompter was an employee of Sorcerous Sundries of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Vompter was one of the assistants to the mage Lorroakan of Sorcerous Sundries in the Lower City . At some point before 1492 DR, Vompter and Miklaur , another one of Lorroakan's assistants, were involved in an incident with a three-eyed man, after which Miklaur refused to talk to Vompter, prompting further communications via letters. One such letter was an order from the master conveyed by Vompter. Miklaur was to collect the newly-acquired inhabited genie lamp and place it within the vaults of Ramazith's tower behind a protective wall as the lamp was too dangerous to be openly displayed in Sorcerous Sundries.</p>
