<p>Takashi Yayazato was a head of the Yayazato clan and a daimyo of Aru Province in Wa during the mid-1700s on the Wa Calendar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Takashi Yayazato became daimyo in Wa Year 1730 (1312 DR) , after the removal of Hisao Matsutomo .</p>
<p>Takashi governed the province well, but suffered much tragedy. Though he had three sons on becoming daimyo, all strong and suitable heirs, two died when their vessel sank in a typhoon and the third was killed in a climbing accident whilst scaling the Dragon's Face of Mount Matazan . Thus, Takashi had no male heirs to succeed him when he died in Wa Year 1758 (1340 DR) . Thus, shogun Matasuuri Nagahide returned the daimyate to the Matsutomos , under Benju Matsotomo .</p>
