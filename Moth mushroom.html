<p>A moth mushroom was a type of edible tree fungus similar to black fungus .</p>
<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>The name "moth mushroom" was coined at some point in the distant past by a forester who opined that a clump of it closely resembled the forest moths that he was familiar with in that same forest, with the "wings" folded up into the mushroom's black and brown cones.</p>
<h2>Habitats</h2>
<p>This fungus could be found across much of Toril , growing under the shade on slender saplings. They were most commonly found on duskwoods and felsuls , but could also be found on many other species of tree when in their youth.</p>
