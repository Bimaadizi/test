<p>The Thorntower family was a branch of the nobility of Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>In early spring of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , one of the young scions of the family was involved in the Marsember meeting of the Rightful Conspiracy . Some remarked on the man's lustfulness in his amorous activities with the pleasure-lass Tharmoraera , and others on his arrogance in believing that only the right nobles (for example, himself) really knew Cormyr and should either lead the effort to depose the Obarskyrs or even replace them.</p>
