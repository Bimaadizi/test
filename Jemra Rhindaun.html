<p>Jemra Rhindaun was a princess of Tethyr and a member of the Rhindaun royal dynasty who married into House Obaskyr of Cormyr through her marriage to Foril I . She was the mother of Irvel Obarskyr , and died tragically in an assassination orchestrated by Sembian agents in 1437 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jemra Rhindaun was the niece of the Tethyrian queen, Sybille II . When prince and future king of Cormyr Foril Obaskyr moved to Tethyr to be an apprentice of the Red Fellowship , he met Jemra and they fell deeply in love.</p>
<p>After a whirlwind engagement, the two of them married in the Year of Stalking Horrors, 1430 DR , but their marriage did not sit well with Cormyr's nobility. The couple welcomed a healthy baby boy the next year, named Irvel, who would also be a Cormyrean king in the future .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Silent Flute, 1437 DR , following years of intermittent conflict between Cormyr and Sembia , Sembian factions attempted an assassination of Azoun V , who was Cormyr's king at the time. Though the assassins' blades were seeking the king, they ended up killing Princess Jemra instead. Royal Mage Ganrahast Aeiulvana secretly blamed himself for the princess's murder, as he attributed her demise to the failure of one of his protective wards. Her death, compounded with the slaying of Crown Prince Emvar previously on the same month, sent waves of mourning through Cormyr. As the people grieved, there were calls for action to be taken against Sembia and their overlords from Returned Netheril .</p>
<p>In the future, when her bereaved husband became king of Cormyr, her death and that of his brother would mold Foril into a deliberate and cautious ruler.</p>
