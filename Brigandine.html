<p>Brigandine was a type of composite light armor , a cross between studded leather and splint mail armors.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A brigandine had undercoat, often made out of soft leather , thick cloth, or rough canvas, and reinforced with leather plates with steel strips inside them. The leather plates were riveted to the the undercoat and another layer of cloth was affixed to the armor's exterior - its overcoat. This construction made brigandine a high lighter alternative to scale armor. More prominent versions of brigandines were made using dragonhide .</p>
<p>The cloth overcoat served three purposes: it reinforced the composition of brigandine and hid the armor's nature from the distance, appearing as regular tunics , and it muffled the sound making brigandines quieter than chain and slit armor, but not as quiet as leathers or studded leathers. Comparatively to other armor types, brigandine was heavier but more flexible than hide armor while being stiffer but lighter than scale mail.</p>
<p>Some makeshift brigandines were crafted by pirates and brigands out of ship sails, canvas sacks, coins , and brass splitters. Even these makeshift brigandines offered good protection against slashing weapons.</p>
