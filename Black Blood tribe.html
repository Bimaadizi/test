<p>The Black Blood tribe was a loose collection of tribes of lycanthropes , shifters , and antherions on the Isle of Moray during the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Black Bloods worshiped the beastlord Malar , and were merciless and bloodthirsty fanatics who desired mayhem and destruction. They were determined to use the two moonwells on Moray to summon Kazgoroth , whom they knew to be an aspect of Malar that had once terrorized the Moonshae Isles . They performed gruesome rituals in their bid to summon Kazgoroth, dragging as many living captives as they could to the moonwells and killing them within the waters. They were indiscriminate regarding who they killed in their rites, being as pleased with orcs and trolls as any humanoid .</p>
<p>The Black Bloods dominated the inland areas of Moray, where they roamed and hunted in packs and attacked anyone that tried to pass through their territory. They focused much of their malevolent attention on Moray's coastline and moonwells near where humans still dwelt. They aspired to exterminate all humans and monsters from the island, transforming it into a sanctuary for lycanthropes and the worship of Malar, and to then begin rampaging across the rest of the Moonshaes. Indeed, when not focusing on Moray, the Black Bloods led savage longship raids on neighboring islands.</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>Most members of the Black Blood employed simple, animalistic battle tactics, with the lycanthropes either attacking from ambush or rushing forward for close-quarters combat and then fighting to the death as they cried out in praise to Malar. If supported by spellcasters, such as hags or Malarite human mages , they stayed back to support the front-line fighters with their spells . Black Blood raiders would respond to any offers of parlay with taunts, calling their enemies "food".</p>
<p>Because their goal of summoning Kazgoroth required that they kill their victims within the moonwells, the Black Blood tribe would often take prisoners after their raids. The need to transport these prisoners to the moonwells left them vulnerable to counterattacks from would be heroes, and also ran the risk of their captives escaping (especially since the lycanthropes tended not to be very careful at binding or watching their prisoners).</p>
<p>When attacking a settlement, they were known to torture captives to death within sight of the defenders in order to break their morale. The lycanthropes would then throw themselves against the defenses, sometimes using logs as battering rams or as makeshift siege ladders , and occasionally making use of alchemical explosives acquired from their spies. They often suffered relatively high casualties in such attacks.</p>
<p>The more intelligent lycanthropes and antherions sometimes took on the form of a human to trick unsuspecting innocents into unwittingly assisting them, letting them into their communities, or simply dropping their guard. Because of this, some human settlements on Moray required all new visitors to prove that they were not lycanthropes by cutting themselves with a steel knife .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Black Blood infested the whole of Moray, but their worship of Malar centered around a hidden temple located deep below Scourtop , the northernmost of the Orcskull Mountains . At this subterranean shrine, thirteen supplicants gathered around an ancient, glyph -inscribed stone slab each new moon to perform rituals and sacrifices in their god's name.</p>
<p>Prior to the discovery of this temple, they had operated out of a different temple in the Orcskull Mountains with an entrance carved to appear as a large, gaping maw.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>While Black Blood warbands might equip themselves with weapons and leather armor , the lycanthropes otherwise wore no clothes.</p>
<p>They kept herds of goats and sheep for food and of horses as beasts of burden.</p>
<h2>Dogma</h2>
<p>As fanatics of Malar, the members of the Black Blood tribe willingly gave their lives in his name. They embraced the most savage and animalistic sides of his worship, and shunned civilized practices such as cooking food, sleeping in beds, or even wearing clothes. They embraced Malarite festivals and practices involving blood sacrifices, such as the High Hunt , while considering more peaceful rites, such as the Feast of Stags , to be heretical perversions of the faith.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The tribe clashed with the various groups of human settlers attempting to lay claim to Moray, including the Ffolk forces of House Kendrick on the north coast at Caer Moray , the Northlanders on the west coast at Farview , and Amnian mercenaries on the east coast at Kork . Druids acting as spies for High King Kendrick were known to attempt to infiltrate the tribe by pretending that their wild shape ability was a lycanthropic transformation.</p>
<p>The tribe counted among its number a few lycanthropes who had originated from the Feywild region of Brokenstone Vale , who took it upon themselves to forge alliances between the Black Bloods and the fomorian Queen Connomae of Oman's Isle . The tribe would subsequently ally with a rakshasa known as " the Fisherman " who plotted against the people of Snowdown .</p>
<p>The Black Bloods worked alongside the Malar-worshiping lizardfolk tribes of Breasal Marsh to summon Kazgoroth, and allowed these lizardfolk to hold sway over central Moray so that they could focus their attention elsewhere. However, there were some tribes among the lizardfolk that secretly awaited a day to revolt against this state of affairs, having received powers and a vision of a better future from the deity Silvanus .</p>
<p>The Black Bloods were also allied with a number of powerful monsters, including the purple dragon known as Whitescar , to whom they gifted their former temple as a lair. They commanded a number of orc and ettin tribes as troops, and had been known to fight alongside the likes of hags, minotaurs , and trained giant rats .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Black Blood tribe was originally connected to the People of the Black Blood , but due to the great distance between them as well as Malar's decline in the 15 th century DR, the two groups grew divided.</p>
<p>It was said that prior to the Spellplague , the ancestors of the Black Blood tribe's lycanthropes hunted alongside an aspect of Malar himself on Moray. At some point, they discovered a secret cave beneath the Orcskull Mountains containing the primitive temple that they went on to consecrate to Malar.</p>
<p>Around the time of the Spellplague of the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , the Black Blood sacked Caer Moray, tore down its walls, and drove out many of the humans from the island of Moray.</p>
<p>After Malar's apparent death in the wake of the Spellplague, his faith among the Black Blood began to wane, but was forcibly kept alive by Argon Bael , a Malarite angel of vengeance . By the mid-to-late 15 th century DR, some members began abandoning the savage ways of the past to rebuild Caer Moray under the leadership of a fey known as Lady Amaranth . In the late 1470s DR, Argon Bael presided over a ritual at the hidden shrine beneath the Orcskulls that revived Malar in the body of a shifter named Kip , and under Malar's renewed leadership, the Black Blood tribes slew many of the human inhabitants of Moray and laid siege to the peace-loving heretics in the Battle of Caer Moray .</p>
<p>By the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the tribe controlled most of Moray and their focus was on summoning Kazgoroth, whom they believed would lead them in bloody conquest across first Moray, then the rest of the Moonshae Isles, and finally mainland Faer√ªn . They frequently attacked civilized communities and groups on the island, such as the settlements at Caer Moray, Farview, and Langmuir as well as at Dynnegall and Kork, two villages that had been resettled after the Black Blood had previously wiped them out. For a short time they made war with the lizardfolk tribes on the island, until eventually the more clever members of each side found that they worshiped the same god and united them in the goal of reawakening Kazgoroth. Together they fought against the Amnians from Kork and their efforts to construct a road to Moray's interior for the purpose of accessing valuable resources.</p>
<p>Later in the year of 1479 DR, Daffyd Mac Lyrr began devising an expedition to Moray to liberate it from the Black Bloods, discussing the plans with his grandfather's generals and allies. He also discovered an old map that showed the location of what he believed to be their temple, but was in actuality their old temple that they had given over to the purple dragon Whitescar to act as his lair. At the time Daffyd was attempting this expedition, some Amnian envoys of "The Fisherman" led by a green dragon were attempting to establish an alliance and commercial ties with the Black Bloods. They requested control of a number of mines and some slaves , and in return offered the Black Blood quality ammunition and weapons made of steel. Daffyd would ultimately succeed in striking a major blow to the Black Blood tribe, but even so, many Moonshavians believed that efforts to reclaim Moray from the werefolk of the Black Blood were doomed to fail.</p>
<p>The Black Blood captured the lighthouse at Langmuir in the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR , further isolating the humans of Moray from support and supplies. They continued to menace the Ffolk of Caer Moray and Dynnegall as of the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , and would subsequently conduct a successful raid on Dynnegall, capturing the settlers and taking them to the nearby moonwell to be sacrificed.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The tribe was predominantly made up of Moray-born human and halfling lycanthropes (notably wereboars , wererats , weretigers , and werewolves ), shifters, and antherions (notably jackalweres ), as well as were-beasts who had traveled from the Brokenstone Vale. Of all lycanthropes in the tribe, those from Brokenstone Vale were the stronger and more rational ones. The tribes also included human worshipers of Malar, who both fought alongside them and served as spies inside their enemies' communities.</p>
<p>Members did not always get along peacefully. Predatory lycanthropes, such as werewolves, were considered closer to Malar and thus were treated with privilege relative to the likes of wereboars, whom they would occasionally eat. The full-blooded lycanthropes were also known to harbor hatred and jealously toward shifters owing to their ability to more easily pass as humans.</p>
