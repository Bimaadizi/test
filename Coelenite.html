<p>Coelenites were colony creatures that began life as single-celled organisms that grew a hardened shell similar to coral. Rudimentary intelligence was achieved when groups of coelenites lived together as a colony, eventually becoming sentient when enough coelenites gathered.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Coelenites living in a colony “grew” a humanoid form by secreting hardened shells that were modified to suite their desire. They often looked like a man encrusted with coral but lacked any sensory organs. Their dexterity was quite poor.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Coelenites were slow but dangerous. They usually attacked in the water but were known to climb aboard ships or land as well.</p>
<p>Arrows, blunt, and edged weapons barely scratched a coelenite’s hard exoskeleton. Spells affecting a single target, such as finger of death , were utterly useless against them. Area effect spells targeting only a small portion of a coelenite would barely harm the creature, but an area effect spell engulfing the entire creature would instantly kill it. Coelenites were immune to all enchantment or charm spells.</p>
<p>Coelenties were sea creatures and suffered damage after being separated from the sea for several minutes, making this one of the most effective ways of “killing” one.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Though possessed of simple intelligence, these colonies acted as single creatures. They stored food, usually rotting fish, in a nest and slowly ate and rested. Coelenites were attracted to noise and sometimes grabbed struggling sailors who fell overboard.</p>
<h3>Mass Colonies</h3>
<p>When more than fifty coelenites gathered together they formed a mass colony that had a higher consciousness called a mass mind.</p>
<p>A mass mind was able to control the activities of surrounding coelenite colonies and used basic strategy in battle. The mass mind would disintegrate if half of its colonies were destroyed.</p>
<p>Mass minds usually claimed entire lagoons as their territory. They were known to entrap ships entering their lagoon by sealing off the exits with hardened shell walls.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Some acted as servants of the marid Kalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari in her Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls .</p>
<h3>Usages</h3>
<p>Coelenite husks were useful for studding clubs and making fine grinding powders. Exotic traders sold dead coelenites to collectors for up to 1,000 gp .</p>
