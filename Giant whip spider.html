<p>The giant whip spider or amblypygus was a rare variety of arachnids that were roaming hunters rather than web users.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The giant whip spider was a human -sized type of pedipalpi. They had flat segmented bodies that were covered in fur of a reddish brown color. They had six normal legs, long spiny pincers, and even longer whip-like feelers, from which they gained their name. Their entire bodies were shaped in such a way as to maintain a grip on their prey with these pincers, regardless of the force.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>They were far-wandering hunters, roaming fearlessly in search of food in groups of up to five, though would never hunt other arachnids of any kind. Against larger prey or opponents they would team up, but would otherwise hunt alone near their packs. They would use their whip-like appendages to probe fissures and other unseen areas for traps or prey.</p>
<p>They would mate once around every eight months, with the female producing a cluster of 2–40 soft-shelled eggs. These would be injected into the body of a disabled but living creature, often pinned under rocks and with its joints broken by the pedipalp couple. When the young hatched, they would then eat their way to freedom through the host creature and form their own roaming hunting groups. Though not having any venom of their own they were still immune to all sorts of poisons and corrosives .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Giant whip spiders fought with their two pincers alongside their vicious bite, attempting to grip their opponents in a crushing hold. Holding foes with their pincers, they would continue biting until anything they held was dead or they were. So tightly did they hold onto their prey that it was said that it was as hard to bend bars as it was to escape the grip of a giant whip spider.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The spined foreleg-pincers were often used by goblinkin to make maces , while the feelers were used to make whips .</p>
<p>The meat was not palatable for most creatures, but they could do so in desperate situations.</p>
<p>They were often used by drow as household guardians, pets, and as the equivalent of hunting dogs.</p>
