<p>Elanalue Sharrith was a treespeaker priestess of Mielikki of the Border Forest in the Dalelands in the early 14 th century DR . She was the last known bearer of the holy Mielikkian spellbook known as Yornar's Trail Companion .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Snow Winds, 1335 DR , Elanalue was captured by drow and taken into slavery in the Underdark . The fate of the Companion was unknownâ€”no one knew if Elanalue had managed to stash the book before the drow caught her, or if she lost it in the chase and the fight, or if the drow seized it as well.</p>
<p>As of 1368 DR , at least six adventuring companies had gone in search of Elanalue Sharrith, the last being the Dwarves of Destiny in Eleint of the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR . But none had succeeded, or even returned. With the Companion lost, the church of Mielikki could do naught but keep "an eye out for it" and try to reclaim it they ever learned of it. In any case, this marked the second breaking of the 'Rightful Cycle' of ownership of the Companion .</p>
