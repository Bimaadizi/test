<p>Tesh Valley was the land surrounding the River Tesh in north Faerûn , from its headwaters in the Desertsmouth Mountains to its mouth on the Moonsea beside Zhentil Keep .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The upper Tesh Valley, above Dagger Falls , was fertile farmland and good hunting grounds claimed by Daggerdale . It was bordered on the west by the Desertsmouth Mountains, and on the north by the Border Forest . To the south, the valley extended until the watershed changed to the Dagger River (the headwaters of the River Ashaba), somewhere around Castle Daggerdale .</p>
<p>The lower Tesh Valley, from Dagger Falls to the Moonsea, was more rocky and untamed. Before the Zhentarim destroyed it, Teshendale was a land of miners, foresters, and lumberjacks, with few viable farms.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>Creatures that could be living in the valley included foxes , martens , porcupines , and otters .</p>
