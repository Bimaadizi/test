<p>Tefnut was the goddess of storms and water in the Pharaonic pantheon . Unlike other members of the pantheon, who traveled to Toril on the ship Matet as manifestations to liberate kidnapped worshipers and went on to become the Mulhorandi pantheon , Tefnut remained behind.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>As she embodied the moisture of the atmosphere in both its calm and wrathful forms, her mood and disposition was very mercurial. Sometimes she was fierce and full of hostility, while at other times she was gentle and loving. However, she was not cruel and would never destroy without cause. Changed in her mood could typically be sensed reading the weather.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>

<p>Her avatar form had access to spells from the spheres all , animal , astral , elemental , summoning , sun , and weather .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Tefnut generally fought by striking her foes with lightning bolt s. If this proved to be ineffective, she would teleport away from the scene of battle.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Tefnut possessed an enchanted sword that she could command to transform into a stroke of lightning. She also had packs of lionesses that accompanied her wherever she went. They obeyed her every command and would defend her without hesitation.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tefnut was created alongside her twin brother Shu by the deity Ra and went on to produce numerous offspring with him. The first of these were Geb (the earth) and Nut (the sky).</p>
<p>When her group of deities were asked by Ao through the intervention of Ptah to assist their worshipers who had been abducted by the Imaskari to Toril , Tefnut stayed behind together with Nut and Shu at the command of Ra. These worshipers, having not yet forgotten of Tefnut, would go on to name an oasis in the Raurin desert after her.</p>
<h2>Realm</h2>
<p>Tefnut resided within the plane of Bytopia , in the layer of Shurrock , in a realm known as Windwrath that sat atop one of Bytopia's many mountains. It was constantly beset by rain and winds that only let up occasionally, which petitioners hid from inside of cavern villages. The largest of these was known as Ston-khat and led by a proxy named Dyalotep the Lame . They spent their time serving Tefnut and aiding any passerby's.</p>
<p>Besides that divine realm, she was believed to reside on the Elemental Plane of Water .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Tefnut's brother-husband was very protective of her and would bring vengeance upon any who dared to harm her. Oftentimes Horus-Re would help him in such endeavors.</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>The priests of Tefnut were typically known to wear scale helmets and wield short swords , though Tefnut had no favored weapon . Her priests could predict the weather with absolute accuracy, and had access to the spells call lightning , control weather , and weather summoning . Her priests were expected to cherish storms, thus it was not uncommon to find them outside during fierce downpours. Their sacrifices to her took the form of animals.</p>
<p>While Tefnut was never worshiped by the Mulan of Toril, some of the marid of Zakhara payed homage to her, and she had a shrine at their Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls .</p>
