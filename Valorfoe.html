<p>Valorfoe was a unique and fearsome enchanted warhammer of the ancient dwarvish make, forged long before the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This masterfully-crafted weapon was carved with magic runes. A single sentence was written on it in the tongue of the ancient gray dwarves : "Tis Not Death That Is Worthy of Dread, But The Fear of Death."</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Valorfoe was created to break the enemy's spirits and resolve in battle in addition to crushing their armor and bodies. With each successful strike, Valorfoe had a chance of inflicting magical fear onto its targets. In addition to this power, the warhammer bore a +2 enchantment that strengthened the weapon's blows and guided the wielder's attacks towards the enemy.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Valorfoe was an ancient weapon even by dwarvish standards. The markings of its creator were long-lost to the history of the duergar by the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR . By the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Valorfoe ended up in the paws of the leader of ice trolls of Icewind Dale , who allied himself with Iceblood , a mysterious blue-skinned shaman who served godling Arctus and sought to lay waste to the Ten-Towns .</p>
