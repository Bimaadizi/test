<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the criminal underbelly of Athkatla erupted in an all-out guild war between the Shadow Thieves and a vampire coven under the leadership of Bodhi, based underneath the city's Grave District . When Bhaalspawn Abdel Adrian sided with the Shadow Thieves to find his abducted sister, the adventurer worked with Aran Linvail . One such mission brought Abdel Adrian to a conflict with Lassal. The Bhaalspawn was sent to contact a Shadow Thief named Mook . During the meeting, she told him that a man passed her station several times, each time in a different guise, yet with the same pale face. Lassal circled his prey, studying her. Lassal confronted Mook and quickly ended her life, finding a new target in Abdel Adrian. The adventurer later faced Lassal during an attack on Bodhi's coven when the vampire tried to spring a trap on the Bhaalspawn in the "room of blood and blades." Subsequently, Abdel Adrian and his companions survived the trap, cut the vampire down, and ended his undead existence by staking his corpse.</p>
