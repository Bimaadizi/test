<p>Kalitrates was a drow elf working with the slaver ring undercover in the Oasis of the White Palm in Raurin in the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Kalitrates stood guard just outside of the room where Zomara stayed. He would be ready to assist if he heard noise elsewhere in the compound, however.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Kalitrates had a short sword and dagger , chain mail , and a small shield ; all of these were enchanted. He also wielded a single javelin coated with drow poison . Finally, he wore boots of elvenkind and a cloak of elvenkind , which eased his avoidance of fire-based attacks. All of his equipment would soon disintegrate if exposed to sunlight.</p>
