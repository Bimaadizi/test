<p>Suzy was a majestic and massive lioness companion of Petyr ], a traveling priest of Nobanion who found himself in the Ten-Towns of Icewind Dale in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Petyr hailed from the Vilhon Reach , where he lived surrounded by the followers of Lord Firemane. His animal companion , Suzy, came from the hot plains of the Shaar and was a fellow servant of Nobanion.</p>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Petyr started receiving visions from his god, compelling him and Suzy to head thousands of miles north, to the frozen tundras of Icewind Dale, despite their natural dislike of the cold climate. Suzy possessed a gift of Nobanion that kept her warm and safe in Icewind Dale's low temperatures. Lord Firemane ordered Petyr to protect the wildlife that was just as endangered by the encroaching ancient doom as the humans of the Ten-Towns.</p>
