<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mavus was a tiefling child with ash-gray skin, stubby short horns, and flaming orange eyes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the famed Circus of the Last Days returned to the city of Baldur's Gate. Izzy and her friend Mavus were curious about the wondrous creatures that the circus brought to Rivington. Izzy and Mavus were trying to peep inside and vault over the circus walls to get inside, despite being forbidden from going inside by Mavus' father. The fielding was the sheepish one among the kinds and was afraid of the circus' djinni but really yearned to see the famed Dribbles the clown, much beloved by the kids of Baldur's Gate. Unlike Izzy, Mavus was worried about trespassing. He could not say the word properly and hoped that kids could not get in trouble over it.</p>
