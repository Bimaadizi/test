<p>Hegruth was an island revealed by the Spellplague in the Sea of Fallen Stars . Small, remote, and missing from all maps, it served as a hidden meeting spot for Thoster ; a single tower stood on its soil.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The island had a beach full of weeds and brine pools, with heaps of gray stone on the sand. There was a single black tower, encrusted with fungi, on the island. A hole at the base of the tower led to a spiral staircase; at the top of the tower, there was a room with a balcony. The room's ceiling was somewhat low.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The island was revealed by waterline changes after the Spellplague . Captain Thoster named it and its tower Hegruth, using it for meetings while it was still outside of any maps. It was the abode of the kuo-toa Nogah until her death on 1396Â DR .</p>
