<p>Darney was a dwarven geologist that lived on the Sword Coast North region of Faer√ªn during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was an older dwarf with white hair, and spoke with a deep, gruff voice.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Darney joined the expedition of Clan Hillborn into Mount Hotenow in order to learn more about a set of ancient dwarven ruins that dated back to the lost realm of Delzoun .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Darney worked directly with Vandra Hillborn to help prevent Mount Hotenow from erupting once again. Unfortunately, the group of students working under him were slain by a member of their group named Zhardol , who either went mad or became possessed by some entity.</p>
<p>Darney worked with Vandra and the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge to recover old work orders from dwarven miners that were killed and raised as ashen zombies following the eruption of Mount Hotenow nearly 30 years prior. He used the documents along with some explosives to dislodge debris that clogged geothermal vents and help ease the pressure that was once again building up inside the volcanic mountain. By following the paths of the vents, Darney helped the adventurer discover the Shadowfire Cavern , along with the magma elemental being controlled by the crazed fire giant Gommoth .</p>
