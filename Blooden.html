<p>Blooden was a succubus and mistress of the Deep Crest , the breeding grounds of the Abyss .</p>
<p>She was one of the demons and devils bound to Ammon Jerro in order to increase his warlock power.</p>
<p>She appeared to have an infatuation with Koraboros , despite the fact he was devil and she was a demon. She commented rather casually that she had mated with many mortal men, even those of celestial descent, but none had survived her violent mating habits.</p>
