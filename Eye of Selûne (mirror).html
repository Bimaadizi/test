<p>The Eye of Selûne was a magical mirror in the House of the Moon temple to the Lady of Silver in Waterdeep in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mounted on the wall at the western end of the transept in the Hall of Wind and Waves, on the third floor of the temple, it was an enormous circular mirror with a cracked glass and aged appearance. Its frame was 6 inches (15 centimeters) wide and inscribed with magical runes. On either side were curtains of deep purple hue; presumably, these could be drawn across to cover the mirror.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Eye of Selûne could be used to scry upon any place on Toril , provided it was illuminated by the moon 's light at the time. In contrast to traditional methods of scrying, such as a crystal ball , success was not dependent on the user's experience or knowledge of the subject, but on the illumination, position in the sky, and phase of the moon. All else being equal, a full moon had a 100% likelihood of succeeding, whereas a half moon had only a 50% chance, and so on. Moreover, it could be used as often and for as long as desired, the only limitation being of course the moon. It could be used by Selûnite priest instructed in how to use it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Time of Troubles in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , the Eye of Selûne was employed by the goddess Shar , then posing as the avatar of the Moonmaiden, to scry on Luna , who was the true avatar of Selûne.</p>
