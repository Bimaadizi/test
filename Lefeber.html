<p>Lefeber was a skilled Netherese arcanist and spell inventor who lived during the Golden Age .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The talented arcanist owned Lefeber's Enchanter , a rod of great power that created an everlasting form of the enchant an item spell. However, its effect differed so that the item would absorb random or specific magic . The magical rod had limited charges, and multiple could be used at once in order to enchant the target item with more power.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lefeber developed five spells during his life. The spells he invented were minor creation in 1701 NY (−2158 DR) , major creation in 1702 NY (−2157 DR) , contingency in 1724 NY (−2135 DR) , and Lefeber's mark in 1725 NY (−2134 DR) .</p>
<p>In 1741 NY (−2118 DR) , the great Lefeber had a breakthrough and developed the very powerful spell, Lefeber's weave mythal . This incredibly potent spell created a mythal that only certain creatures could pass through, so long as they were familiar with the activation key. Lefeber made sure that the mythal that was produced by this spell had multiple activation formulae, and thus other archwizards were able to use his ideas.</p>
