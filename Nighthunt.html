<p>The Nighthunt was an inn to the east of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The inn was located one's day ride east of Loudwater, on the southern side of the Dawn Pass Trail to Llorkh , near the South Wood .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Nighthunt was a sprawling wooden lodge of low height embraced by pine and maple trees. Many spells were cast on it to prevent fires breaking out.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>It was a rather quiet and comfortable establishment. Although not famous, it was favored by local adventurers , hunters , and even outlaws in hiding, as well as Harpers and enemies of the Zhentarim , of whom the innkeeper was a vocal critic.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Around 1365Â DR to 1370 DR , it was run by Ildur Arntar , a former ranger . He was aided by his wife Shaltana and their four daughters (two of whom were restless and keen to become sword-wielding adventurers themselves), as well as six former adventuring companions of Ildur. They were famous for their prowess in battle, at least in the area.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>There was a local tale of a ghostly boar hunt being sighted on some nights, which would run into the South Wood. This was the source of the inn's name, the Nighthunt.</p>
