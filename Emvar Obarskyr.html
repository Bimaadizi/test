<h2>Relations</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Relatively little is noted of Crown Prince Emvar's life. His was apparently a life of responsibility, having been groomed for rulership. He did enjoy at least two romantic affairs, however, one with a woman named Laendra Shatterhawk , whose son was adopted by House Crownsilver , and another with a merchant's daughter from Dhedluk named Solatha Boldtree , who was made a Countess and invited to live in the Royal Palace in Suzail .</p>
<p>Emvar was assassinated in the Year of the Silent Flute, 1437 DR by Sembians south of the Vast Swamp scant months before the birth of his second son, leaving his brother Foril as the new heir to the throne of Cormyr. Later, Foril died on Eleint 5 , the Year of the Nether Mountain Scrolls, 1486 DR , in his sleep.</p>
