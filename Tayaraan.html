<p>Tayaraan was a small village found within the Cities of the Ancients region of east Zakhara in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Tayaraan sat at the mouth of the Kadan River where it emptied into the western edge of Bahr al-Ajami , making it quite an isolated settlement. The nearest major city was Rog'osto to the south. Though it was located roughly in the middle of the Ruined Kingdoms, Tayaraan was the easternmost occupied settlement as of 1367 DR. To the east stretched a vast expanse of dense jungle and ruins.</p>
