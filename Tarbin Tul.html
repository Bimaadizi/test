<p>Tarbin Tul was a wandering bard on the Sword Coast North in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tarbin Tul performed along the High Road and always looked for new tunes to add to his enormous collection. Circa 1491 DR , while staying at the Wayside Inn one night, he accidentally witnessed an undead attack. The undead had been created by the cult of Myrkul led by Ularan Mortus . A group of adventurers was able to defend the inn against the attack.</p>
<p>Later, while Tarbin was again staying at the Wayside Inn, a cult of Talos led by Fheralai Stormsworn took over the inn. Although the cultists' ritual to turn the inn into a temple of Talos was stopped in time, they managed to kidnap Tarbin. He was taken to the death knight-dreadnaught , a ship controlled by the death knight Emberlost . Fheralai had taken over the ship from the Myrkul cult but was unable to steer it. She forced Tarbin to perform songs from Anauria , the death knight's lost home. This appeased Emberlost, convincing him to tolerate Fheralai and let her steer the ship as long as the bard kept performing. Eventually, the same group of adventurers came to the Tarbin's rescue and freed him from his captivity.</p>
