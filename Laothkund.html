<p>Laothkund was a city in the Unapproachable East , on the coast of the Sea of Fallen Stars . It was later known as Laothkund the Drowned after it sank into the sea.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>There were caverns beneath Laothkund, which the merro sons of the great shaman Porag wanted as part of their reign.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Circa 764 DR , Laothkund had a number of lords.</p>
<p>The independent city had been under Thayan control since 1357 DR . However, they held the city only nominally as of 1368 DR , and loosely as of 1372 DR . Like much of the Wizards' Reach , the Shadowmasters of Telflamm had strong influence there.</p>
<p>A ruling council existed on 1375 DR , which the Shadow Tongue thieves had plans to blackmail by implicating them in false conspiracies with the Red Wizards , and slave trade in children (which was illicit).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The region was first settled by people from Chessenta between −250 DR and −100 DR . The city of Laothkund broke free of Unther in 482 DR . Unther abandoned its wars on 679 DR to focus on reclaiming Laothkund.</p>
<p>In the late Year of Mistmaidens, 764 DR , the armies of the Lords of Laothkund struck at Nethrar (later Nethra ) in Galadorna , destroying the Unicorn Kingdom forever.</p>
<p>Laothkund was important to Gargauth 's worship.</p>
<p>The city came under Thayan control in 1357 DR , during the Salamander War . During the Spellplague of 1385 DR , Laothkund's Thayvian government was secured and reinforced by the forces of Mordulkin . They city became Laothkund the Drowned at most a decade later, by 1396 DR , after the seismic shifts from the Spellplague caused the land to sink beneath the waves.</p>
<p>By 1479 DR , the submerged and silted streets were populated only by fish and sea monsters. Much of the city's old wealth had yet to be plundered.</p>
<h2>Demographics</h2>
<p>Half-elves of wood elf stock were very common in the city. Like in the rest of the Wizards' Reach , the humans were a grand majority Mulan , with a smaller number of Chondathans and Rashemi , and a small fraction of Damarans .</p>
<h2>Weather</h2>
<p>Gusts from the Sea of Fallen Stars usually kept the city fairly temperate, even in Midwinter .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h3>Sal's Tavern</h3>
<p>Sal's tavern was a location close to the Shadow Tongue lair. The local sentries were known to go there.</p>
<h3>Tannery</h3>
<p>The tannery was a quarter with narrow streets.</p>
<h3>Smokehouse Inn</h3>
<p>This inn served alcohol, and included locations for armwrestling.</p>
<h3>Shadow Tongue Lair</h3>
<p>The lair of the Shadow Tongue thieves' guild was on a building at least three stories tall, with one window on the third story boarded up on the outside and brick-and-mortared from the inside. The room that bore that window had been converted to a storage closet; down the hallway, there were rooms, a downwards-pointing stair with a switchback, and on the hallway below, at least one office and one privy. A hidden panel led to another set of stairs, and an iron-valved door that led to the vault, which doubled as Sathra's personal quarters.</p>
<p>In the vault, objects of great value were stored. Two smokeless torches were placed on stone pillars flanking the entrance; the shade of the pillars kept the back of the room dark. The obsidian tiles of the vault helped keep the room dark. There was a fabled red room somewhere else in the lair, where Sathra could visit unlikely tortures on her foes.</p>
<h3>Green Warrior Inn and Tavern</h3>
<p>This tavern featured some women of the night.</p>
<h3>Tenambulum's Library</h3>
<p>The mage Tenambulum had a library in the city as of 1374 DR . There were wards in it.</p>
