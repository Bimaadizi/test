<p>Javor was an old chieftain of the Uthgardt Elk tribe during the Elemental Evil crisis.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In life, Javor was a great Uthgardt chieftain. His remains were buried in a mound near the Nettlebee ranch.</p>
<p>In 1491 DR , Wiggan and Bertram Nettlebee , under the orders of Cult of the Black Earth leaders, set a trap for some adventurers who had defeated the earth cultists at the Sacred Stone Monastery . They burnt Javor's mound, attracting the adventurers with rumors of a "fire witch" in their fields.</p>
<p>When the adventurers came to investigate the mound, Wiggan summoned an earth elemental to destroy the mound and kill all inside. However, this awoke Javor. Javor rose as a revenant wanting revenge against Wiggan and Bertram. He was helped by an Uthgardt war group led by the berserker Fennor . Somehow the adventurers resolved the situation and Javor went back to the afterlife .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Javor was an honorable man, even in undeath . He tried to find and kill only the true culprits, but had no mercy for those that protected them.</p>
