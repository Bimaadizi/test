<h2>History</h2>
<p>Fennibal was a one-man wrecking crew, and he used his strength in the Battle of Ingdal's Arm of the Year of the Watching Wood, 1065 DR . In the battle against human infantry, Fennibal charged into his enemies and singlehandedly pushed the entire regimen back. The half-elf gave his life, contributing to the eventual win of his side's troops, leading to the half-elven declaration of independence. Stories of Fennibal "Thunder" Bale's heroics continued to inspire Aglarondans as late as the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR . The set of armor worn by him during the fateful battle, the Mail of Fennibal "Thunder" Bale , eventually left the Unapproachable East and found itself in the great merchant hands in the city of Westgate in the late 14 th century DR.</p>
