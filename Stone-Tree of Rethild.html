<p>The Stone-Tree of Rethild was a, presumably, unique stone or petrified tree found in the Great Swamp of Rethild in Dambrath sometime before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This item resembled a tree covered in spine-like stone protrusions growing out of the central sinus tentacle-like trunk that spiraled up from the rest of the tree. The Stone-Tree of Rethild was always warm to the touch. However, it was unknown if it possessed any magic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This strange object was recovered from the depths of an unnamed ruin in the Great Swamp of Rethild before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR . It found its way into the collection within the curio store in Westgate run by Mintassan the Magnificent, where it was proudly displayed to his customers.</p>
