<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Deep Kingdom was established after the fall of Telantiwar and stood unconquered for generations.</p>
<p>In −1250 DR , the nation of Unther waged war against both the Deep Kingdom and the elves of the Yuirwood .</p>
<p>The Thunder Blessing filled the caverns of the Deep Kingdom beyond their capacity, so a large number of gold dwarves set out to expand in new lands.</p>
<p>The reigning monarch of the Deep Kingdom in 1373 DR was Queen Karriva of Clan Simmerforge . However, the actual power in the Deep Kingdom lay in the hands of the Deep Lords, the governing clan council. Each of the clans had the right to appoint four clan elders to the council, which ruled from some time in the 7th Century DR. Kings, Queens, High Princes, Princes Royal, Axe Princes, Princess, Princess Royal, War Princess, and Duke were just some of the common hereditary more exalted titles which continued to represent the royalty. Due to endless feuds, bickering and internecine wars, and the rising threat of drow and duergar, the Deep Lords were created to maintain unity within the Deep Kingdom. They dispensed justice, commanded the armies, and dictated policy.</p>
<p>When the Spellplague struck Toril in 1385 DR , great rifts opened up in the Underdark beneath the Sea of Fallen Stars , which in turn caused the collapse of great swathes of land. The Underchasm formed in southern Faerûn , devastating the Great Rift, including the Deep Realm and its capital of Underhome . Many gold dwarves were able to flee the cataclysm through the elemental portals that fed the Riftlake, and others, including the Deep Lords, fled east to the devout city of Eartheart .</p>
