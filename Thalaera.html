<p>On the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , one of the night-dancing rites in which Thalaera participated under Qilué Veladorn was interrupted by the intrusion of Dove Silverhand , who joined their dance despite being a human . She sought the head priestess' aid with a drow infiltration of Scornubel , as she was a fellow Chosen of Mystra and another of the Seven Sisters ; Thalaera protested this, but the head priestess told her that she was free to consult with Eilistraee personally by meditating upon the Ladystone on the center of the glade. She took up Qilué on her offer.</p>
