<p>Spur, the Claw of Death was a powerful kama found in the ruins of Myth Drannor in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Spur's power was drawn from the dracolich Karliath , bearing the ability to steal lifeforce, paralyze foes, and simply incinerate them in gouts of fire.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The kama was linked to Karliath, a dracolich trapped in the old Cult of the Dragon base hidden in the ruins. The weapon may have then been taken by the Cormanthor Elves when Phathroi had them attack the Red Wizards of Thay there.</p>
