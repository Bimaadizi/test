<p>Windvane was an enchanted spear forged by the drow wizard Vizeran De Vir , and wielded by Aerisi Kalinoth during her time as the leader of the Cult of the Howling Hatred .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Vizeran De Vir, a drow worshiper of the Elder Elemental Eye , forged the spear Windvane using part of the essence of Yan-C-Bin , Prince of Evil Air, in a temple known as the Fane of the Eye . He left the spear to await its prophesied bearer.</p>
<p>Sometime in the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR , Aerisi Kalinoth found the spear and used it to open an elemental node to the Elemental Plane of Air to summon Yan-C-Bin. The weapon was destroyed by adventurers who used it to seal the node.</p>
