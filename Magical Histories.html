<h3>Volume I: The Origins of Mystra</h3>
<p>The tome focused on the first incarnation of the Goddess of Magic, Mystryl , who was said to had been born from a primordial battle between light and darkness, the deities Selûne and Shar . Each of the divine sisters shed a portion of their magic into a new deity – a being of pure Art . As such, Mystryl became the absolute mistress of all magic in the world, forming it into the weave , a way to harness magic. She was the weave.</p>
<p>The book continued to describe the Year of Sundered Webs, −339 DR , when Mystryl perished and was reborn as the new goddess of magic – Mystra , as the outcome of the Karsus's Folly , the ancient event in which Netherese lord Karsus sought to take the magic of Mystryl for himself. She ended her own existence to stop Karsus from achieving his goals, temporarily unweaving all magic in the world, which became the end of the Netherese Empire.</p>
