<p>Harandil Thundersword was a knight and a member of the Thundersword noble family in Cormyr who rode with Princess Alusair Obarskyr . He was softly spoken.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Alusair and her knights were operating in the Stonelands, pursuing a bold orc band that had raided a caravan east of Eveningstar ; in six days of pursuit, they'd killed a hydra , a " fire lizard ", and three chimeras . They were on a high meadow north of Startop Crag when the knights impetuously pursued the orcs into an ambush, and a few were killed. Alusair rallied her forces to defeat the orcs and their dark naga master. When Alusair said warriors cleaned up after themselves, Harandil added that "or they soon die", agreeing with her plan to clear the Zhentarim threat to the area.</p>
