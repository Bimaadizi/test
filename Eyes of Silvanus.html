<p>The Eyes of Silvanus were two islands, Ilighôn and Wavecrest , near the mouth of the Vilhon Reach on the Sea of Fallen Stars . The islands were formed from mountains when Jhaamdath was flooded.</p>
<p>After the Spellplague hit and the waters from the Sea of Fallen Stars receded, the islands were joined with mainland Turmish due to the lowered water level.</p>
