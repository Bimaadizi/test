<p>Vardos , more commonly known on Toril as gypsy carts or gypsy wagons , were a type of wagon used by gypsies in the Vast region of Faer√ªn and by the Vistani in the Domains of Dread .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These wagons were covered with curved roofs, often described as being "barrel-topped", and were pulled by horses . The Vistani built these wagons themselves and their design was rather uniform across all of the Vistani tribes, though the Kaldresh were known to decorate their vardos with elaborate metalwork.</p>
<p>Vardos held great significance in Vistani culture, being viewed as symbols of prestige and signs of wealth. They were also important for providing Vistani with secure places to perform fortunetelling, scrying , and spell component crafting.</p>
