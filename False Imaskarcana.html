<p>The False Imaskarcana were a collection of seven artifacts created before the collapse of the ancient Imaskar Empire . By their name, they were associated with the genuine Imaskarcana , seven artifacts that recorded the empire's knowledge of magic .</p>
<p>One of the False Imaskarcana was Dhonas's Shroud . Other artifacts once similarly associated with the Imaskarcana , but later known not to number amongst them, were its sister artifacts: Ynaerv's Mask , the Mask of Aberration , Shade's Veil , the Mask of Shum , The Facade , and The Master's Face . Together, they were better known as the Faces of Madness .</p>
<p>After the empire's fall, in −2487 DR , the surviving artificer Kujawa carried Dhonas's Shroud and claimed the Dragon Throne in the Khati city of Thakos , the former capital of Upper Imaskar. With that, he declared himself Emperor and founded a new realm, Anok-Imaskar .</p>
