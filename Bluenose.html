<p>Admiral Bluenose was an infamous Dread Pirate servant of Umberlee , the Bitch Queen, who lived sometime before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Admiral Bluenose served his goddess even after displeasing her. As a punishment, Umberlee sent a lightning to strike Bluenose, however, the Dread Pirate survived the ordeal. He later donned a set of enchanted Umberlant chains called Stormscale , designed in honor of the Bitch Queen's sahuagin servants. Admiral Bluenose spent time trying to make amends with his deity, eventually parting ways with the magic chainmail sometime before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
