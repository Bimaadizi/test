<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Icewind Enchantments shop was opened in late 1372 DR or early 1373 DR , soon after the Neverwinter â€“ Luskan War, by Silvenius Crim . The mage was sent away from the Host Tower of the Arcane to the town of Targos to open a shop and seek "economic opportunities." Despite Silvenius's disdain for the backwater settlement and its poor inhabitants, he welcomed the distance away from his superiors and freedom to pursue his magic research. In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Silvenius Crim performed a dangerous summoning ritual using rare materials provided to him by Luskan. He summoned a snow weird from the Elemental Plane of Air into a summoning circle in the shop to question her about the danger looming over Icewind Dale, but the questioning turned into a battle. Silvenius Crim and his shop survived thanks to the Hero of Neverwinter .</p>
