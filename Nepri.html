<p>Nepri was a great efreeti that appeared in the ruins of Myth Drannor in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The genie appeared alongside the other fiery creatures T'Zull , Thulkaan , and more fire elementals inside the soon-to-be Burning Library after being dragged from his home plane by the malfunctioning mythal . He soon set the library ablaze to be more to his liking, to the great distress of the guardian electrum dragon Jurin'ildren and the librarian Kaylie . After fighting through his minions the library defense team faced the efreeti and drove him back through the portal , then pursued him back to his own domain in the Elemental Plane of Fire , slaying him there to ensure he did not return.</p>
