<h2>History</h2>
<p>Farnvik was a cultist cleric of Tiamat . In 1489 DR , he was one of the main leaders of the contingent of cultists who'd arrived secretly in Phlan aboard ships. Just after the green dragon Vorgansharax killed or captured the city's leaders at Valjevo Castle , Farnvik led a cultist patrol, including a guard drake and a half-dragon ettin , to collect "tributes" from Phlan's citizens. He was eventually defeated by an adventuring party.</p>
