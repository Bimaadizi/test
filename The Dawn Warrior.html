<p>The Dawn Warrior was a small and dangerous island off the coast of Chult .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Dawn Warrior was a lushly overgrown jungle island. When the island was seen from a ship sailing by, its shape was reminiscent of a cone- helmed head and an axe , raised to the "shoulder."</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Dawn Warrior was located at the north-eastern edge of Chult in the Shining Sea , just beyond the Refugee Bay , and to south-east from Kitcher's Inlet and Port Castigliar .</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>The main point of interest on the Dawn Warrior was its north-eastern peak seen from afar. The elevation was known as Iylya, or "the Eye." When overlooked from afar, the peak was the part of the island that looked like an axe. Iylya was rising from the edge of the water and was a well-known sailor sea-mark.</p>
<p>The island's shores were coated in white rocks that caught the morning sun and radiated a gentle pink glow. The shores did have beaches, but they offered no shelter during powerful storms.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Even though small, the Dawn Warrior faced settling attempts as early as 700s DR . Most of these attempts were made by various cults and pirates, but none were long-lasting. Many dangers of the wild island made sure no group claimed the Warrior. Pirate raids crushed some, and some were exterminated by the yuan-ti . Another historical danger of note was the fact that the island was used as a nursery by green dragons .</p>
<p>Sometime shortly before or during the 14 th century DR , an unknown force used mysterious magics to transform the island's inhabitants into monstrous beasts, terrifying creatures that made the island even more deadly and inhospitable than before. Some claimed that the creatures came from a gate somewhere on the island.</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, the Dawn Warrior was known for being the arena for young Chultan aarakocras test of strength. This test was one of the tasks of the right of passage. The outsiders could also be tasked with venturing into the monster-infested island to complete the same task and win the tribe's respect and trust. Skeletons , zombies , Batiri goblins , and pterafolk were among commonly seen monsters of the island during that time.</p>
