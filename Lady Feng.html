<p>In the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR , the black dracolich known as Hethcypressarvil abducted Lady Feng from the Ginger Palace and manipulated her son Prince Tang, into creating an oil made from ylang blossoms from Shou Lung. The undead dragon desired the senior wu jen into formulating a love potion that would force Lady Yanseldara of Elversult into loving him the same manner as he did her.</p>
<p>Setting out to prove himself as a leader, Prince Tang ventured out alongside General Fui D'hang and several squads of Shou royal guardsmen to rescue Lady Feng from the nameless swamp . Nearly all of the soldiers were slain by Cypress and its wyvern pets, Tang was forced to flee the assault, managing to navigate through the dragon's underground lair and finally find his mother's whereabouts.</p>
<p>Reunited in the caverns beneath the swamp, mother and son were able to briefly outsmart Cypress and force him to leave his lair for the surface above. Together they retrieved the staff with the spirit gem holding both her and the Cypress' souls, and shattered it into many pieces, preventing the undead dragon from regenerating its physical form after being destroyed.</p>
<p>After their ordeal, Lady Feng joined her son, Minister Hsieh Han Liu , the Harper Ruha , and the leaders of Elversult for a grand feast, celebrating the newfound friendship between that city and the Ginger Palace.</p>
