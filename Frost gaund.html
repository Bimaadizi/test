<p>Gaunds were a species of sentient lizard-like creatures.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Due to their appearance, gaunds were often mistaken as large, non-sentient lizards. Their most distinguishing physical characteristic was their three, bright red eyes. Their skin was comprised of scales and had the texture of leather. They were quadrupeds but were capable of standing upright, using their large tail for balance.</p>
<p>Frost gaunds were identical to Gaunds but lived in much colder climates. The only physical differences between the two was in their eye and skin color.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Thanks to their excellent infravision , gaunds had perfect vision in both light and dark, and capable of seeing through smoke. In addition, their were able to detect vibrations in the ground. Their central eye emitted a powerful effect, which affected a target in the same manner as a heat metal spell. Gaunds had a natural immunity to heat, and significant resistance to magical fire. They were vulnerable to cold-based and sonic-based effects and spells.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Gaunds were ferocious in combat. Instead of using weapons, they used their sharp claws and teeth against an opponent. Its tail made for an effective and painful whip.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Gaunds were communal creatures and their society was simple, unstructured and in touch with their natural surroundings. Gaunds did not make tools or weapons. However, gaunds hoarded any treasure or gems they found and used these to trade for food. They were territorial and defended their claimed territory with ferocity.</p>
<h2>Habitat</h2>
<p>Gaunds made their homes within dry caverns near heat, often in areas of active volcanism. Large populations of gaunds could be encountered in the Upperdark region underneath the Black Ash Plains and Smoking Mountains . A large population of gaunds used to reside under the Lake of Steam , but they were hunted by the drow of Gaulidurth , and beholders who lived nearby, to near extinction.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Gaunts were omnivores and despite their simplistic lifestyle, they practiced limited animal husbandry and plant cultivation.</p>
<p>The Gaund mating ritual involved a complicated dance with an egg-bearing female, whose skin temporarily changes to bright orange. Four months later, a pregnant gaunt laid a clutch of up to four eggs. The shells of the eggs had a texture similar to leather and was covered in a pungent slime. Juvenile gaunds reached maturity after six months.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>Gaunds were hunted by various subterranean humanoids . Their teeth were fashioned into tools and weapons, and the tail of a gaunt was a highly sought-after delicacy, not only due to its taste but the fact that the meat spoiled much slower than most. The slime that covered the eggs of gaunts was known for its abilities to neutralize nearly any acid and fire resistance properties, and the slime that covered the eggs of frost gaunts was known for its abilities to protect from extreme cold.</p>
