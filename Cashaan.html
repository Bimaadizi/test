<p>Cashaan el Farid hailed from Calimshan in west Faerûn . After the defeat of Arklem Greeth , former Archmage Arcane, Cashaan and his fellows began to rebuild the Arcane Brotherhood 's trade routes. As of 1485 DR , he began to recruit adventurers to help make Luskan a more peaceful town, as merchants would rarely visit the city. He did this in a cautious, secretive manner, in order to keep the revival of the Arcane Brotherhood from the ears of others. Cashaan was the Archmage Arcane by 1489 DR .</p>
