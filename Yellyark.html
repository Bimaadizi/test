<p>Yellyark was a village in Chult that was home to the Biting Ant tribe of Batiri goblins . It was built within a lattice of trees that were bent over and tied together with vines.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The settlement was located in the northern jungles of Chult, just north of the River Soshenstar . The trees upon which it was built were planted in the center of three enormous ant colony mounds.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , Yellyark was ruled by a Queen Grabstab .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The settlement was constructed in quite a unique manner; it was inside a grouping of bound trees, attached to a larger, stronger tree. This created a sort of "catapult" effect. If Yellyark was truly threatened, the bindings that held the bundle of down could be severed and the whole village could be launched a great distance away over the jungle canopy.</p>
<p>Yellyark employed more traditional measures of defense, such as tripwire alarms, camouflaged batiri sentries, and ant swarm defenders.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Around the Year of the Iron Dwarf's Vengeance, 1485 DR , around forty goblins lived within the village.</p>
