<p>Vilirith was an archaic noble elven house from the Time of Dragons .</p>
<h2>Territory</h2>
<p>The Vilirith territory coincided with the heart of King Orchtrien 's realm.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Vilirith were vassals of Orchtrien, but they were not very loyal to him.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In −25,090 DR , the house of Vilirith set an ambush together with the Starfall and Duskmere against some of Orchtrien's forces in a forest within the heart of his own kingdom. They nearly defeated the arriving force, captained by Rhespen Ash , an elven wizard ; however, Prince Bexendral teleported into the battle and struck the traitors down before Rhespen's surrender.</p>
<p>After the rebellion was quashed, the heirs of the House were then taken to Dawnfire to learn and to serve as hostages, which would ensure the House remained in good behaviour.</p>
