<p>A lyre of building was a type of enchanted lyre that enabled to create structures at a rapid pace or undo any damage to a structure.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These lyres were indistinguishable in appearance from a cli lyre . They typically weighed around 5 pounds (2,300 grams).</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Due to the enchantments put upon them, a lyre of building was indistinguishable from a mundane lyre. They carried a faunt aura of transmutation and required attunement. There were both proper and improper chords on a lyre of building and activating its effects required strumming the correct ones.</p>
<p>Once per day, when the proper negatory chords on a lyre of building were strum, it would negate any damage from a horn of blasting , disintegrate spell , an earth elemental attack, a battering ram or similar siege weapon that was being inflicted upon an inanimate structure. This included such things as floors, walls, roofs, etc. This effect spanned an effective range of 300 feet (91 meters) and would persist for up to 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Additionally, once per week, if the proper chords were strum a lyre of building could magically construct any manner of building or structure, including ditches, mines, tunnels, barricades, or in the construction of dungeons . This effect could also be used to create specialized rooms for unsuspecting enemies and to build or repair ships and spelljammers . Within but thirty minutes of playing a lyre of building to this purpose, one could accomplish work equivalent to that of a hundred humans laboring over three days.</p>
<p>Additionally, the music of a lyre of building had the power to offset the entrancing call of a harpy . If one of false chords a lyre of building were ever struck, there was a small chance that all of its effects would turn negated. They also could not function underwater, unless played in some form of air-filled sac, like that produced by the airy water spell. Like most magical instruments, it was believed that the effects of a lyre of building would double in effectiveness when employed in the hands of a proper bard .</p>
<p>Following the Second Sundering , a lyre of building could negate nearly any form of damage upon a structure within 300 ft (91 m) of it. They also enabled their wielders to cast mending at any time and the power to cast once per dawn the spells fabricate , move earth , passwall , and summon construct .</p>
