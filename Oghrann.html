<p>Oghrann was a dwarven realm founded on and under the Plains of Tun , in central Faerûn during the Age of the Proud People . It was a vast nation, difficult to defend for the relatively meager population of dwarves. .</p>
<p>The sigil of Oghrann was a hunting horn encircled by a six-pointed star.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>At its height, Oghrann surrounded the valley of the River Tun , extended into the Sunset Mountains in the west and underneath the Storm Horns in the east. It skirted Boareskyr's Forest , referred to by the dwarves as Wurgymvudd or "Ugly-Wood". The lands to the northwest, known at the time as the Helbryn , were also claimed by Oghrann as a hunting reserve, but settlement of those lands was forbidden since the time of King Thordbard. .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Oghrann was founded in the wake of the fall of Shanatar , by the realm's first and most legendary warrior-king, Thordbard Firebeard , in −5125 DR .</p>
<p>Oghrann lasted until shortly after Ammarindar was abandoned, continuing on until the year −3770 DR . Disease and attacks from monstrous humanoids , such as lizard men , bugbears and wemics , spelled the end of the realm and its 7,000-odd survivors fled to the Far Hills to the west.</p>
