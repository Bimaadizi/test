<p>Oldin was a a Zhentarim agent in the late 15 th century DR who met an untimely end in the Underdark near Tethyamar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the drow high priestess of Lolth Talice Argith discovered the jewels of ardor in Tethyamar, she sent for the Zhentarim to evaluate them and the possibility of selling them on the surface. Oldin was the agent chosen for the job of inspecting the gems for her, and then attempting to negotiate a favorable sales deal on behalf of the Black Network. Oldin met a dwarf guide shortly after entering the Underdark , but before they could reach the drow stronghold , they were beset by wild umber hulks and messily devoured. Only a few pieces of travel gear remained scattered about, as well as Oldin's arm, still clutching their orders tightly in their hand.</p>
<p>While this was the end of Oldin, a short while later the dwarves of the nearby Tethyamar mining outpost launched their own attack on the drow stronghold in revenge for the many dwarves killed and enslaved by the drow. Their team may have found Oldin's remains and read the letter, allowing them to impersonate the Zhentarim delegation and easily gain access to the fortress.</p>
