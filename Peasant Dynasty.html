<p>Peasant Dynasty was a common variety of enchanted kama .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was richly decorated and fit for courtiers and not work in the fields.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Each of these kama bore a simple +1 enchantment that guided the weapon towards the target and slightly increased its damage, as well as made it possible to harm creatures typically unaffected by mundane weapons. Peasant Dynasty also granted the wielder a small degree of resistance to acid , cold, lightning, and fire.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The history behind the creation of these kama was undiscovered; however, their design led some sages to speculate that despite their markings and appearance being similar to courtly daggers wielded by nobles and royals, the original Peasant Dynasty was created or commissioned by a courtier who rose up from the lowly life of field workers and peasants—an unusual thing that was outside the traditions of royal bloodlines.</p>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR, some of these enchanted kama or copies made from the originals were found in the city of Neverwinter and nearby lands.</p>
