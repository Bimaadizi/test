<p>Toke Horgath was an Uthgardt human of the Elk tribe of the Evermoors in the Savage Frontier in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the conflict known as the Battle of the Evermoors sometime around 1400 DR , the Elk tribe battled the Cult of the Dragon for control of the helmet of disjunction . Although the Elk warriors outnumbered the Dragon Cultists, they had the black dragon Rakor on their side and vomiting acid on the barbarians' ranks. The Elk chief, Stanhard Grimwulf , gave the helmet to Toke to carry to safety, but Toke was abruptly chopped in half, sideways, by a Dragon Cultist, and died. The fallen Elk tribesmen were interred at a sacred burial ground on the site .</p>
<p>A century later, in the late 1490s DR, the body of Toke Horgath was exhumed by Edgin Darvis , Simon Aumar , Doric , and Holga Kilgore (a member of the Elk tribe herself). Using Simon's deathly token to speak with the dead , they questioned Toke's corpse over the fate of the helmet of disjunction , and then about assorted other things to finish the spell.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>His favorite food was barley , after considering oats . He did not really like cats . Finally, he was not good at mathematics , struggling even to answer 2 + 2, but might be excused on account of being a corpse. [ speculation ]</p>
