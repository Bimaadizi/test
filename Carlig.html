<p>Carlig was a duergar trader in the Underdark .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Carlig set up a duergar trading encampment, along with Finderlig and Uder Mordin , near the underground entrance to Spellhold . He reported to Gorion's Ward that he had recently seen Jon Irenicus and Bodhi travel through the Underdark towards a city called Ust Natha .</p>
<p>Despite being typically xenophobic to surface dwellers, he was more than eager to trade with them. Carlig sold an array of spells and equipment. He considered himself a simple trader, and did not wish to get involved in matters concerning the drow . Despite this, he would only sell his special goods to races native to the Underdark.</p>
