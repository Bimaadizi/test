<p>Shining White was the ancestor mound of the Griffon tribe of the Uthgardt .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It included a large cavern and tunnel complex located in the Spine of the World mountain range in northern Faer√ªn . The narrow passes the lead up into the cavern were warded with runes by Gerti Orelsdottr .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , it was inhabited by frost giants , who were once united and ruled by Jarl Orel , an ancient frost giant who lay on his death bed. His daughter, Gerti Orelsdottr, was at the time the de facto ruler of the giant clan, and being his only child and heir, it was likely that she would succeed him and become the official ruler of Shining White once he was dead.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Shining White was an ancient barbarian burial cairn. Its name came from both the white marble menhirs and the white chalk soil uncovered by the barbarians' cuts into the permafrost layer.</p>
