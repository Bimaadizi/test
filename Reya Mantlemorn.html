<h2>History</h2>
<p>Reya was born in the land of Turmish , but came to the city of Elturel when she was twelve, so that she could train as a Hellrider.</p>
<p>When the city of Elturel was transported to Avernus in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Reya was training a few miles north of the city when it vanished, to her horror. Returning to the site of the city, she found only a gigantic crater, and decided to lead some refugees to the shelter of Baldur's Gate .</p>
<p>Once inside the city, Reya was separated from the other refugees after a group of Flaming Fist thugs confronted them. She was able to shake one off, and fled into the city in disguise. While on the run from the law, she began to look into the whereabouts of Thavius Kreeg and his association with the Vanthampur patriar family .</p>
