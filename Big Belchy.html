<p>Big Belchy was a unique construct , designed to resemble a dragon turtle , that was created by the Gondar clergy of the House of Inspired Hands in Waterdeep in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>This construct had an internal mechanism that allowed it to exhale clouds of scalding steam, in emulation of the breath weapon that dragon turtles possessed.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Wyvern, 1363 DR , the clergy of the House of Inspired Hands presented their artificial dragon turtle to the Waterdhavian public on Marpenoth 3 , as part of a nautical exhibition for the annual Day of Wonders . The construct managed to make one full rotation around Deepwater Harbor before sinking into the depths, becoming part of Umberlee's Cache .</p>
<p>For the next century, the construct would remain at the bottom of Deepwater Harbor, left to accumulate barnacles on its metal shell.</p>
<p>Then, in autumn of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a group of Lantanese rock gnomes under the employ of the drow mercenary Jarlaxle managed to enact repairs upon the long-abandoned construct, allowing Big Belchy to surface once more. One day, a group of adventurers cornered in Mistshore two gun-toting agents of Bregan D'aerthe , Fel'rekt Lafeen and Krebbyg Masq'il'yr , that had in their possession the stone of Golorr . Big Belchy surfaced from the water not long after, acting as their getaway vehicle to Jarlaxle's flagship, the Eyecatcher . According to some accounts, the adventurers managed to inflict enough damage upon the construct to force it to sink back into the depths of Deepwater Harbor.</p>
