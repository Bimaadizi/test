<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>The Lords of Madness, Vol 4: Yeenoghu was an aptly named tome as it talked about demon lord Yeenoghu. It agreed that the Lord of Savagery left a firm mark on the Prime Material plane . The Gnoll Lord created compulsive mindless ravenous hunger that affected his creations - gnolls above all other creatures. The book then went on to describe the process of the creation of a gnoll. The book claimed that gnolls were born of hyenas chosen by Yeenoghu. The beasts needed to kill and then feast on the recently dead flesh. Then a gnoll was born out of a hyena's belly, ripping its way out or being cut free. The tome talked about how gnolls were the personification of hunger and how they ripped apart and devoured anything on their paths, leaving nothing more than bones behind. It also claimed that gnolls did not care for money, wealth, or treasure, and their only goal in life was sating their ravenous hunger. Each kill, each consumed creature, was an offering to the demon lord, funneled directly to him from the gnolls. Lastly, the author advised the reader to burn corpses and cover the scent if they ever became targets of a gnoll's attention.</p>
