<p>Arellaxerrontoal was an bronze dragon living in the Forest of Tethir and the regional agent of the Moonstars for Amn and Tethyr in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Arella and her mate, the bronze dragon Trollushanthallor , welcomed a clutch of three wyrmlings while living in the Small Teeth mountains. Unfortunately for the pair, the blue dragon great wyrm Iryklathagra awoke from her slumber in 1369 DR and learned of the wyrmlings' existence. She waited until Arellaxerrontoal, the more powerful of the adults, left the lair, and then attacked and slew Trollushanthallor and two of their offspring. Iryklathagra carried the two wyrmling bodies back to her own lair to feast, while the third wyrmling, the female Alaerurrgos , escaped, but was badly wounded. Iryklathagra also looted the hoard of the bronze pair, adding their wealth to her substantial hoard.</p>
<p>Arellaxerrontoal and her daughter relocated to the Forest of Tethir, where Arella left Alaerurrgos with a centaur settlement in the Wealdath. Count Gamalon Idogyr , Sage of the Court of Tethyr at the time, was charged with her safety and tutelage.</p>
<p>For a long time she was consumed by revenge. Arellaxerrontoal's work for the Moonstars alleviated her pains.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Arellaxerrontoal believe that the unity of humanity and elves that the Moonstars hope to achieve can bring the demise of all evil dragons, like the killer of their mate.</p>
