<p>Feltin was a commoner from an unnamed coastal village in Northwest Faerûn who perished at the hands of a green hag in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Feltin was a simple man and a favorite drinking buddy of Del and Grace . At some point in the late 15 th century, his hometown became plagued by ghostly voices calling to townsfolk from a nearby small island. This haunted island became the cause of the disappearance of many villages, including Feltin himself, who followed the sinister calls. In the 1490s DR, Del and Grace sought help from the heroes of a northern Targos town – Forge Fitzwilliam , Edgin Darvis , and Holga Kilgore , after the village's first hireling, a spellslinger named Simon Aumar went missing as well.</p>
<p>With a promise of generous pay, Forge convinced Edgin to investigate the haunting, thinking it to be an easy job. When the group reached the island, they too heard voices calling for help, only to find nothing on the island but killer vines of black oily substance. Subsequently, the group discovered that a green hag took residence on the island. They discovered Feltin's body – a skeletal gnawed remnant of a man. He was killed and eaten by the hag or her servant roper . Edgin collected the holy symbol of Chauntea from the corpse to return to Feltin's friends.</p>
<p>Angered at the "adventurers" bringing dire news, Del and Grace refused to pay the promised fee. They did not see the friend's body, and a simple grain-shaped pendant and a tall tale were not proof enough.</p>
