<p>Thindhul was one of the Empyrean Knights until 1375 DR . After the Keeper of the Cerulean Sign Telarian struck Commanders Brathtar and Dharvanum down, he hastily promoted Thindhul to the position of Commander, so that he could lead their passage to Sildëyuir across the Underdungeon of Stardeep .</p>
<p>Thindhul was nervous, feeling unprepared for the task. He failed to stand up to even the most ridiculous of Telarian's orders during the ride, agreeing even to the suggestion to ask a relic lich for directions, despite his own better judgement saying otherwise.</p>
