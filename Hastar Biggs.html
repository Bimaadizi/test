<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a group of Gondians was put to work at the Steel Watch Foundry in Baldur's Gate against their will, forced into slave labor by Lord Enver Gortash and his Cultists of Bane . One of the two motivations for the slaves' compliance was the fact that the Gondians' family members were abducted and held hostage within the drowned Iron Throne headquarters . Hastar Biggs was among the cult's hostages. It was unknown if the hostages were rescued before the conclusion of the Absolute crisis , or if the prison was flooded in retaliation for the foundry workers' uprising.</p>
