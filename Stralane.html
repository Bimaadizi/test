<p>Stralane was a malaugrym meddling near the Dalelands in the mid-14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Stralane possessed the knowledge of the Art and shapeshifting abilities common to all malaugrym.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He traveled together with his sibling, Magusta .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1357Â DR , Stralane tried to cross through the warden of the Gates of Doom as part of a mule train, without the password. The malaugrym in the mule train, including him, his sister Magusta, and two other malaugrym named Architrave and Sintre , slew the warden first and then the rest of the caravan. The two others then attacked them, forcing the two first siblings to flee through a portal, likely on Mirtul 20 .</p>
<p>After the parting, Stralane decided he'd had enough of Magusta's schemes, and wanted to withdraw for some recreation, thus taking his own path. They reunited at some later point to scry on the other two malaugrym from earlier, discovering a woman who appeared to retrieve a trinket from his charred body in the process.</p>
