<p>Zabou mushrooms were a species of fungus that produced toxic spores, often found in Chult .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Zabou mushrooms were notorious for releasing poisonous spores when disturbed. Skilled gatherers knew how to handle the fungi, gathering them without triggering the spore release. If agitated, the mushrooms exploded with toxic spores in a radius of 10 feet (3 meters). Creatures that inhaled the spores suffered the poison's effects for up to one minute. As a side-effect, the spores caused itching when they contacted bare skin.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Zabou grew in areas of rich decaying vegetation, wood, and rotting flesh. They were often found growing on fallen trees or on the floors of ancient ruins.</p>
<h3>Uses</h3>
<p>If gathered with caution, zabou mushrooms could be used as projectile weapons. If hurled at one's enemy, the mushroom exploded with the poisonous spore cloud, akin to a thunderstone or a container of smokepowder .</p>
<p>A carefully harvested specimen was valued at 10 gold pieces .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , the merchant prince Jessamine of Port Nyanzaru was known to send adventurers into the jungles of Chult to gather zabou mushroom samples for her.</p>
