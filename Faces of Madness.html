<p>The Faces of Madness were seven artifacts of ancient Imaskar . Each of them was a mask themed after a school of magic . They were intended to be used to overthrow Imaskar and achieve unlimited power, but the Mulan Rebellion prevented their creators from taking full advantage of their powers.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Each of the Faces of Madness carried great power over a school of magic, and bore a horrifying curse that only the creator of each mask knew how to bypass.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Cabal of Madness was an alliance of Imaskari archmages in pursuit of power without limits. They gained the knowledge of how to build artifacts from horrors beyond their world, and over decades, constructed several masks of such power. The masks were finished before −2488 DR , but not soon enough to allow the Cabal to carry out its plans: the Mulan rebelled, bolstered by the powers of their pantheons arriving that year. The masks became lost in the resulting tumult. One of them resurfaced in −2487 DR , carried by Kujawa to Thakos .</p>
<p>By the late 14 th century, they were sought by a number of groups, among them the Harpers , the Red Wizards , mages from Halruaa , the Zhentarim , and the Tel'Teukiira . Though their number was not known with certainty, knowledge of seven of them was still available at that time. They were considered to be the Imaskarcana by some sources, but later and more complete ones put them in a category known as the False Imaskarcana .</p>
