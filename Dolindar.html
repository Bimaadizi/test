<p>The Dolindars were a family of wizards who were banished to the Shadowfell sometime long before the 15 th century DR . The family settled in Evernight , becoming a rarity in that city: living humans . There they studied arcane magic and came to be experts on the subject of interplanar travel.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>In addition to the Dolindars' modest wealth, they owned a number of family treasures, including: a copy of the book Out of the Endless Prison , a driftglobe adorned with a map of the gate-towns , a gold helmet , a necklace of adaptation inscribed with "My breath is yours, Kevetta —take it", and a snow globe containing a miniature replica of Neverwinter .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The reason for the Dolindars' exile was lost to history, but it was known that the family bore a curse that rendered them unable to use portals to travel between planes , thus trapping them in the Shadowfell.</p>
<p>At some point, the family built a tomb for themselves and managed to install a permanent portal to Neverwinter —known as a Crevice of Dusk —deep inside of it. However, they were evidently unable to use this portal to escape from Evernight owing to their curse. They subsequently hired a caretaker for the tomb named Newmy , and by paying her many lifetimes' wages up front, they bound her to maintain the tomb even after her death.</p>
<p>The family eventually passed away and were interred in their family tomb alongside their treasures. As of the late 15 th century DR, Evernight's more ancient residents (such as the vampire Sangora ) still remembered the Dolindars.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The family was relatively small and insular. It included at least twelve members, all of whom were lonely and miserable following their banishment to the Shadowfell. These emotions would continue to haunt them long after their deaths.</p>
<p>Notable members included:</p>
