<p>Enkidu's full plate was the suit of iron armor worn by the famous Kara-Turan warrior Enkidu .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The armor possessed a powerful +3 enchantment and offered its wearer limited protection from spells and other magical effects. Additionally, it offered complete protection from any cowardly backstabbing attacks, such as those made by rogues , assassins , or the Wu jen .</p>
<p>Weaker copies of the same plate mail only held a +1 enchantment and offered resistance to piercing and slashing weapons.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first set of these enchanted plate mails was created for a famed and undefeated warrior Enkidu. His combat prowess was so great that no fighter was brave enough to challenge Enkidu. Instead, his enemies used the services of backstabbing assassins, ninjas , and wu-jen . Enkidu's full plate was crafted and enchanted to withstand such attacks. After his death, numerous copies and variants of the magic armor were created.</p>
<p>Enkidu's full plate eventually made its way to the Faerûnian realm of Calimshan , and came into the possession of the Amkethran smuggler Carras . A copy of Enkidu's armor was brought from Kara-Tur in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR and sold in Okuzo's Imports of Westgate .</p>
