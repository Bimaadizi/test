<p>A giant snake was a larger and much more powerful version of an ordinary snake .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As the name suggested, these creatures were the giant versions of snakes. They were identical in all but size and predatory habits (as their larger size allowed for them to tackle larger and more powerful prey). Unlike some other altered forms of animals, giant snakes only possessed animal-like intelligence.</p>
<p>Due to the large variety in giant snake species, they were usually described by their individual types: amphisbaena , constrictor , poisonous , sea , and spitting . These species had different sizes, habits, and methods of attack.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>All types of giant snake were carnivorous. They were deadly predators, and often sought out other giant animals, such as giant frogs .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Giant snakes either attacked by utilizing their natural poisons or constricting their prey.</p>

<h3>Usages</h3>
<p>Priests of Sseth were known to construct special shields by treating the shed skin of giant snakes and wrapping them around a core of ironwood .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
