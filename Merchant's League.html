<p>The Merchant's League was an organization based in Baldur's Gate that promoted safety on the caravan routes throughout the region surrounding the city. The League began to decline in the midâ€“14th century DR because of many other local costers being formed. Under the leadership of Dabron Sashenstar and with the backing of the Dukes of Baldur's Gate , the Merchant's League grew into a priakos and began to challenge the Iron Throne for the weapons trade in the Western Heartlands in 1374 DR .</p>
<p>Prior to 1482 DR , the Merchant's League was dissolved by the Council of Four , tough it continued to operate through its member families, which controled the Woodworkers, Seafarers, and Traders guilds.</p>
