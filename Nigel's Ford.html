<p>Nigel's Ford was the primary crossing point of the Beaumaris River in eastern Vaasa .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Nigel's Ford lay along the Beaumaris River as it flowed south out of the central highlands of Vaasa and headed for Bloodstone Pass . It was located at a point where the river had just exited the Clefts of Razack .</p>
<p>The road which crossed through Nigel's Ford connected the crossroads of Maur-Eturo in the Sunderland to the south with the city of Palischuk and other points in northern Vaasa. Another road ran east along the river to the Vaasan Gate and beyond to Damara . In the late 15 th century DR , the tent city of Fugue lay along this trail.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Historically, crossing the Beaumaris was not particularly difficult in the lowlands as it froze over completely in the winter months and was not particularly deep even in the middle of summer. As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, Nigel's Ford was the most notable of the Beaumaris's many fords. It was too shallow for boats to pass, which made navigating the riverway difficult.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, Nigel's Ford was the site of the only bridge across the Beaumaris in Vaasa's eastern lowlands.</p>
