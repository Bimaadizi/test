<p>Arlagh Deathclaw was the "Old Gut", or chieftain, of the Ripped Gut orc tribe that lived in the stronghold of Baraskur , in the Nether Mountains during the 14 th century DR .</p>
<p>While Arlagh typically led the tribe with the help of a council of elders, his authority was overshadowed in the presence of the ghost of the sorceress , Aumathra . When her spirit would periodically possess a body brought to her by the orcs, her commands superseded all others and she treated the orcs as slaves.</p>
