<p>Myrkuth Longpipe , more commonly known as Ilph , was a former thief and watchmen who served within the City Watch of Waterdeep during the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ilph was strong and thin for a halfling . He had black hair and favored black clothing when not wearing his watchman's uniform.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the mid-14 th century Ilph was a sneak-thief who roamed the rooftops and delved within the sewers of Waterdeep. In his off time he frequented the taverns of the city's Dock Ward .</p>
<p>Sometime during the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR , Ilph was stashing some his ill-gotten loot in a hidden cache located in a hollowed-out stone block on the roof of the Palace of Waterdeep , when he was stopped by one of Waterdeep's Masked Lords . The lord chased the thief atop the city's building, keeping deft footing as well as Ilph, and eventually caught the criminal. Unbeknownst to Ilph, this lord was the newly-elected Nindil Jalbuck .</p>
<p>Ilph was sentenced to six-years service within the City Watch. While he initially detested this new life that was forced upon him, by the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR he came to respect the Watch and enjoyed the attention and respect he garnered among his law enforcement comrades.</p>
