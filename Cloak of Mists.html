<h2>History</h2>
<p>A strange enigmatic being only known as Metastakixx was trapped in an ancient temple in one of the caves in the Crab's Claw Coast . The being's history was unknown; however, it was believed that Metastakixx was an incredibly old creature tasked with protecting remnants of an old and forgotten deity. As of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Metastakixx was still bound to the temple and waited for the one person destined to let them free. If the strange being was to be freed from the eternal bondage, the Cloak of Mists was sure to be a reward for the kind deed, despite freedom being Metastakixx's doom.</p>
