<p>The Agents of the Eye was a slaving ring in Skullport run by a paranoid elder beholder .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Agents of the Eye was a slaving ring created by The Eye after his arrival in Skullport in 1205 DR . In time, his business and his organization grew. At one point, he re-formed his organization into a semi-autonomous model and retreated into the background, spreading rumors about his demise or retirement. Soon, most people forgot about the beholder slaver and, in 1304 DR , the Agents of the Eye were simply a large slaving ring in Skullport with no association with beholders.</p>
<p>At one point before 1370 DR , the Eye managed to slay and replace Xanathar , leader of the Xanathar Thieves' Guild , and so he merged the two organizations, his slaving ring and the thieves guild of Xanathar.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The organization was actively trying to run Halaster's Heirs , the arcane academy, out of the Dungeon Level of Undermountain .</p>
