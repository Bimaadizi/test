<p>Untisczer was a city in Lapaliiya in southwest Faerûn . It was one of the Cities of the Seabreeze .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It stood on a point of land east of Tashluta that extended north of Malaxer . By the 14 th century DR , the spit of land and the ruins lay beneath the waves of the Shining Sea , with the remaining ruins approximately 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) off the coast.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Along with all of Lapaliiya, Untisczer was once a member of the Confederation of Tashtan (founded in 34 DR , which was ruled from Tashluta in the Tashalar .</p>
<p>However, the slayings of almost a dozen Tashalaran merchant lords by the rogue Magister Ergith "the Kingslayer" Klavulgrun ( 276 – 278 DR ) left Tashtan in a leadership crisis and ill-equipped to resist the demands of Qysara Shoon V ( 281 – 300 DR ) of the Shoon Imperium that the Cities of the Seabreeze host garrisons of imperial soldiers. In the Year of Wasteful Pride, 285 DR , the Shoon Imperium snatched control of Lapaliiya, but its cities remained effectively independent. Nevertheless, there was an uprising in Untisczer, but it failed. Nevertheless, Shoon V had an excuse to launch the Tashalar Campaigns , already long planned. Untisczer was obliterated as a shocking show of military and magical force and the remaining Tashtan cities were captured and installed with military governors, all possessions of the Shoon Imperium.</p>
<p>By the 14 th century DR, most of the stones of the ruined city had been taken away for other construction, with the remainder still lying under the sea and half-buried in shallow mud.</p>
<h2>Population</h2>
<p>The city was once home to Anthilar , the legendary Archmage of Untisczer. After the city's obliteration in 285 DR, he escaped to his secret mountain lair , became a lich , and plotted to covertly control the Tashlutan merchants.</p>
<p>Circa 1373 DR , morkoths , scrags , sharks , giant octopuses , and other aquatic predators and monsters lurked in the ruins of Untisczer.</p>
<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>Predictably, the ruins were reputed to contain much "drowned treasure".</p>
