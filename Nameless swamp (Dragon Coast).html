<p>The nameless swamp of the Dragon Coast was the lair of the black dracolich Hethcypressarvil . It was unmarked on maps , never given a unique name, and unknown of by many in the region, including the Cult of the Dragon .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The fetid waterways of the diminutive swamp were tangled with a network of tree roots, and were barely navigable by small prop boats. Its black waters smelled of death and decay, largely due to the tremendous amounts of dead sharks that were fed to the undead dragon in order for it to regrow its physical form.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The swamp was located near the Giant's Run Mountains , half a day's ride by horseback southeast of the Shou Lung embassy, the Ginger Palace .</p>
<p>One of the few people that knew of the swamp's location was Prince Kao Chou Tang of the Ginger Palace, due to his regular dealings with the dracolich that made his home within.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR , Prince Tang led an ill-fated expedition into the swamp in order to slay the creature colloquially known as Cypress the Black. All of his punts were overturned and destroyed, and his men slain by Cypress and the beasts of his lair, with minimal effort or exertion.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In addition to the undead dragon, the swamp was home to a myriad of snakes , alligators , and even a pair of wyverns that were kept as pets by the great wyrm.</p>
