<p>Pipes of sounding were enchanted birdpipes that allowed the player to create a vide variety of sounds.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When a skilled performer played pipes of sounding , they could generate various illusory sounds, similar in function to the ghost sound spell. The generated sound could appear from as far as 60 feet (18 meters) from the player. Some of the sounds that could be created via these pipes were: blowing wind, running water, creaking, whistling, laughter, moaning, cry, mumbling, footsteps, bird song, and many others.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Pipes of sounding could be constructed by a capable crafter of wondrous items with the use of the ghost sound spell.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before the fall of Myth Drannor in the Weeping War of 714 DR , a masterwork set of magical pipes of sounding was the life-long creation project of the City of Song's Loresinger. However, the Loresinger perised before his project was completed and interred in the Polyandrium within the Loresinger's Crypt . The crafting recipe and research for pipes of sounding could be found within the crypt when it was unsealed in 1369 DR .</p>
