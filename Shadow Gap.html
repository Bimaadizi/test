<p>Shadow Gap was a corruption of its original name - Shaddath Gap. The mountain pass was a lonely winding trail that climbed up the side of Shadow Gap from where travelers could observe both Dalelands and Cormyr.</p>
<p>The walls of the gap were huge steel-gray granite slabs that appeared ghostly in the midday sun. The deeper one stepped into the Gap the more day sun became blocked making the travelers move in the dark long before nightfall. Being hidden from the sun and higher in the mountains, it was always chilly inside the gap.</p>
<p>The gap was mostly barren with occasional outcrops of bushes. In the spring, water flowed the same winding trail the travelers moved on, making moving the wagons a slow and laborious process.</p>
