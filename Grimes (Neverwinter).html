<h2>Possessions</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Unbeknownst to all, Torlinn Shrake was defeated and replaced by his beholder nemesis – Sharrestren , several decades before the late 15 th century DR. The eye tyrant used the wizard's name and wealth to throw lavish weekly parties and masquerades. Grimes was among hired orchestra musicians during the creature's last revel. Using boots of spider climbing, the musicians were to play their instruments while upside-down on the ceiling, to the guests' delight. Between performances, Grimes made an error accepting a drugged drink from Forge Fitzwilliam , a charming rogue , who was part of a heist crew led by Edgin Darvis . After being knocked out, Forge left Grimes to sleep it off next to the fellow knocked-out lute player. Grimes's boots of spider climbing were claimed by the rogue.</p>
