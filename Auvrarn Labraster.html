<p>Auvrarn Labraster was a merchant from Waterdeep in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . He was part of an obscure, nameless intrigue that was uncovered by the Seven Sisters .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Auvrarn was handsome: his hair was glossy brown, and he had a square jaw. His voice was mellifluous.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>In the appreciation of Syluné , he understood only whips, or boots.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>An ongoing magical effect devised by Halaster Blackcloak allowed him to trade positions with an especially large umber hulk , even in dead magic areas; when he triggered this effect, he seemed to be transported to a cache of his own. On the other hand, the Red Wizard Thaltar Glaervar was able to do the same with him. He was protected against scrying with wards strong enough to slay even a Chosen of Mystra at the center of her demesne should they try to scry him, thanks to more of Halaster's spells.</p>
<p>After being remade by Halaster Blackcloak, Auvrarn displayed bizarre abilities, including eyes that glowed purple, hurling purple lightning, and calling forth purple fire.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Originally, Auvrarn was a trader in trinkets and furs.</p>
<p>He had some form of interest in the Black Baron tavern in Sembia .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was known to Mirt . He was led by Halaster Blackcloak in a nameless, extensive cabal of intrigants, where he was linked in a teleporting chain with Thaltar Glaervar, Azmyrandyr , Roeblen , and an especially large umber hulk . He was also in contact with the drow slaver Brelma through Mrilla Malsander as a liaison. The Sharran priestess Meira was a fellow of rank similar to his own in the cabal.</p>
<p>While disguised as Blandras Nuin, he hired Karlae and Nalambra as his maids.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He collected enchanted weaponry, and had a number of glowstones , a habit he didn't break even when disguising himself.</p>
<p>He owned a teleport ring , amongst other devices.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Auvrarn Labraster was a merchant of Waterdeep who traded in trinkets and furs. He entered at some point into a cabal with multifarious aims of cementing its own domination throughout Faerun , under the leadership of Halaster Blackcloak. He dealt with the drow slaver Brelma through the young heiress Mrilla Malsander, who acted as their liaison.</p>
<p>He came to the attention of the Seven Sisters when Laeral Silverhand and Qilue Veladorn followed Brelma to a route in Skullport that led to his cellar. In 1369 DR Laeral Silverhand tried to find him at his home in Windpennant Pillars , but upon entering and failing to find him, was informed by Elaith Craulnober , who had followed her inside, that Auvrarn had just arrived at Silverymoon by then.</p>
<p>Two days later, he met with Garthin Muirtree in the Red Griffon Room of the High Palace of Silverymoon; the place was chosen at his insistence, for he claimed to fear a sneaking magic. Garthin Muirtree was later found dead, mysteriously, with his body badly mangled, as if he had been mauled by something immense. In reality, the last person he'd been scheduled to meet with during that day had received a note claiming their moot had to be postponed, despite the guards having led someone with their appearance to and from the room; that person was Auvrarn Labraster in spell-guise, who then used a magical teleportation cycle cast on him to summon an immense umber hulk to slay the man, and depart the room.</p>
<p>Alustriel interrogated him last of all her suspects afterwards; she found his words very measured, and after he stormed out of the interview in a rage, she found it to have been kindled too suddenly, out of nowhere. Unsatisfied with their talk, Alustriel confronted him again, this time in his quarters, after magically sealing the door to his room; he activated the magical cycle again, leaving an umber hulk to fight her. He returned after the red wizard Thaltar called on the teleport chain, this time armed with a necklace pocket which held a teleport ring ; however, while he struggled to free it in the fight, Alustriel was able to hide a small rock in his hair, a fragment of Sylune's hearth.</p>
<p>He teleported to Neverwinter, where he met with Meira, a Sharran priestess, whom he had visited twice previously; she aided him by giving him a magic-dead ring and transforming his body into that of Blandras Nuin, a merchant from Neverwinter she'd killed without anyone knowing yet. He spent some time in Neverwinter, under the provided disguise. While so disguised, he killed Alaithe , Blandras Nuin's maid, and hired Karlae and Nalambra in her place, learning news of the cabal only sporadically. His ring prevented Sylune from taking any action against or around him, until one evening where he had to remove it alongside the rest of his clothes to clean himself off of some horse dung he tripped onto. In the guise of Alaithe, Sylune proceeded to interrogate him thoroughly as to his actions as part of the cabal, promising to let him out of the tub if he answered all her questions. However, she continued to haunt him for the rest of the night.</p>
<p>Afterwards, his house exploded in flames conjured by the Simbul ; he tried to take refuge in the bathtub. After the explosion, he was magically recalled by Halaster Blackcloak, who healed, or rather, remade him: the damage to his body was barely short of lethal. While he worked, Halastar was speaking a littany which contained nothing that Auvrarn could make sense of. The merchant suspected divine influence at hand.</p>
<p>Auvrarn finally turned up at an altar of Shar where Halaster Blackcloak was fighting Storm Silverhand alongside Mirt and Dumathchess Ilchoas ; he struck forth with lightning. However, he was just then stabbed in the neck from behind by Elaith Craulnober, which ended him.</p>
