<p>The metsuke were the secret police of the shogun and a part of his goverment. Their job was primarily to spy on the daimyo and report any insubordination among them. A member of the metsuke would report directly to the roju , the Council of Elders.</p>
<p>There were usually sixteen metsuke at any given time, though the number could vary. The secret police was an honored office, respected by Wa's citizens, like all other offices in the shogun's government. The shogun himself approved anyone serving in the metsuke.</p>
