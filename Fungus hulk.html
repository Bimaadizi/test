<p>A fungal hulk or fungus hulk was a monster made of rocks and fungal mass.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A fungus hulk encountered beneath Stardeep was a bulky, hunch-backed humanoid with a black bony carapace that only partly concealed its mushroomy flesh. A puffball covered its head, from which questing filaments extended. It had black, large claws like daggers . These claws had obsidian incorporated, which was stained violet from the fungal exudations; the bony carapace was actually dissolved limestone .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Of note, at least one fungus hulk's strength and power were such that it could shatter even the bodies of revived fossils with a swing. Their touch also inflicted a deadly rotting disease that might well kill its targets within a minute. Even those who received healing were bound to lose an extremity. Plants that were damaged by the hulks suffered almost twice as much damage.</p>
<p>Fungal hulks were unaffected by heat, and by most controlling spells , such as charm , hold monster , and sleep . Even sorcerous fire was only half as effective. Their carapace incorporated dissolved limestone; the creature actively incorporated obsidian fragments on its extremities to aid in its digging.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>One fungus hulk was intelligent enough to accept the aid of strangers while fighting revived fossils. Later, it would turn out to possess altruistic tendencies such that it attempted to save Adrik Commorand , even unto its ultimate death.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>While attempting to reach Stardeep through the Underdungeon , Kiril Duskmourn , Raidon Kane and Adrik Commorand came across such an entity in the caverns, which Raidon Kane mentally named a "fungus hulk". They later fought alongside a fungus hulk, perhaps the same one. Before it died of its wounds, it helped them retreat from the fight with Adrik's body.</p>
<p>In the 15 th century DR , fungal hulks were known to inhabit the Chondalwood .</p>
