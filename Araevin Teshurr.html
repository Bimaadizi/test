<h2>History</h2>
<p>Araevin was born around 1108 DR , at the House of Cedars , where he explored the surrounding trails as a child.</p>
<p>Araevin spent years traveling northwest Faerûn studying elven portals and spell structures after finding that Evermeet's libraries were not sufficient. Most of these were relics of Illefarn or Siluvanede . In order to explore the ruins of these realms, he formed the Company of the White Star .</p>
<p>Araevin was accepted for training as a High Mage in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , though his actual training was not due to begin for 50 more years.</p>
<p>However, events that unfolded soon after his acceptance, such as the attack by the daemonfey and the Elven Crusade of Lord Seiveril Miritar later forced him to travel to Faerûn . There, he found an ancient loregem ( selu'kiira ) from ancient elven empire of Aryvandaar and by gathering all the pieces, he gained the knowledge of how to cast high magic . In order to cast high magic by himself rather than as part of a group, he made contact with a celestial eladrin from Arvandor or Celestia , who let him take some of her soul essence. He lost some of his mortality as a result and became a half-celestial eladrin himself, through the high magic ritual known as the Telmiirkara Neshyrr .</p>
