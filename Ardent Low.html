<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Ardent Low was forced to gain entrance and perform inspections of the "Old Garlow 's Place" in the Lower City , after the building owner failed to respond to communications from the city. Ardent determined the abandoned building to be in gross violation of the city by-laws 38a-39c and had it condemned in accordance with by-law 42a. Liaison Low left a notice on Garlow's home, and recommended the owner to contact the local Builder's Guild representative in regards of immediate repairs.</p>
