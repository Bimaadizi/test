<p>Circa 1372 DR , the trio were searching for an annihilator , intending to capture and control it with the aid of Jessek's charm monster eye-ray power. After they had an annihilator, Jessek wanted to hunt down and slay the outcast beholder Tobulux for being an abomination, as well as his illithid companion Ralayn who would oppose them.</p>
