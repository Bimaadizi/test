<p>Queen Connomae was a fomorian who ruled in the Feywild realm of Vor Thomil during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She wielded a staggering level of arcane magic , so much so that it had twisted her mind and body. She was thoroughly mad , and ruled based on random whim.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The queen was ruthless, greedy, and terrifying. She was obsessed with ideals of courtly elegance, grandeur, and civility, and demanded that all in her presence behave "properly" (with her definition of "proper" constantly evolving). Those who failed to meet her expectations were tortured and executed.</p>
<p>She was always seeking to amuse herself. She enjoyed forcing prisoners to perform for her entertainment, often forcing them to dress up in makeshift formal attire and present themselves as "ambassadors" as they sang, recited poetry, or fought each other as gladiators . She was known to richly reward those who pleased her, and even to release those who earned her goodwill through their performances. Sometimes she would simply dump these lucky prisoners out into the Feydark on her kingdom's borders, and other times she would have them escorted safely to the surface. Those who displeased her were often killed in elaborate and terrible ceremonies.</p>
<p>She was also an obsessive art collector. She had no sense of what made art good or bad, and she was just as likely to destroy a piece as to display it proudly.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Connomae protected Vor Thomil and allowed passage between her realm and Oman's Isle in the Moonshae Isles . She wished to eventually expand her realm onto all of Oman's Isle and to use that as a base to envelop the rest of the Moonshae archipelago. This would provide her with advantages against her enemies elsewhere, and notably with a large quantity of slaves that she would send back to the Feywild in order to assault the city of Shinaelestra .</p>
