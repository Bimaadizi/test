<p>Extremiton was an ulitharid leader of a mind flayer colony in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , githyanki attacked a large illithid colony deep in the Underdark . Before being killed, the leading elder brain ordered Extremiton to escape to the surface and estabilish a new colony. Extremiton managed to arrive in Seadeeps in Undermontain and settled there, planning to transform itself into a new elder brain. Despite the relative security provided by the dungeon around the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the colony was under threat of extermination by the githyanki group living in the Crystal Labyrinth . So Extremiton halted its plan of transformation and instead bred a neothelid , planning to send it into the Crystal Labyrinth to deal with the githyanki.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Extremiton became intrigued by the complexity of human life in Waterdeep and wanted to know better how the city worked. It built a series of psipods in the level, devices that could imprison sentient creatures in a dream version of Waterdeep called Alterdeep , crafted from information gathered telepathically from Waterdhavians' minds. The ulitharid then manifested itself in the illusion as any character it wished, although it showed a preference to appear as Durnan .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Usually Extremiton was in the main control room of Alterdeep and sometime checking the breeding of the neothelid.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Extremition had plans to conquer Waterdeep. However, the city's vast population had made the ulitharid extremely curious.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Extremition was the favorite vassal of the elder brain of its colony.</p>
