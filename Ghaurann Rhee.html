<p>Ghaurann Rhee was a merchant with some understanding of the the Art and a member of the smuggling and slavery ring known as the Tarntar . He sold spells that enhanced beauty, provided adornment, or embellished the face and figure along with his line of skin-care products and cosmetics.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Rhee was a smooth-talking salesman who used his good looks and skill with flattery and lies to inveigle his customers into buying his wares.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime around the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , Rhee was traveling with a cohort of his partners-in-crime and happened to be in Voonlar staying at the Whistling Wizard inn when two groups of Harpers independently decided to cleanse the inn of some of its inhabitantsâ€”creatures that were masquerading as humans. None other than the Simbul recognized them in the common room of the Wizard and taunted the Tarntar elite enough to goad them into a fight. What later became known as the Battle at the Bar destroyed or damaged quite a few rooms and resulted in the deaths of at least three members of the cabal. Ghaurann Rhee managed to escape while the Harpers were distracted by the arrival of the local law enforcement officers.</p>
