<p>The Silaviul Mountains were a mountain range in southeast Faerûn , and were an arm of the great Yehimal mountains.</p>
<p>They separated the kingdom of Ulgarth and the barbarian lands to the east from the Utter East proper in the south. A river ran through the plains along the northern flank, before turning south in the Stony Waste and crossing through the mountains at their western end.</p>
