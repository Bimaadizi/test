<p>The Firefly was a mysterious and rather nondescript shop found in the Temple District of Ravens Bluff during the late 14 th century DR . Not much was known about the building, its services or owner; in fact, it could only be identified by its name appearing on tax rolls within the city records.</p>
<p>The shop was located on the west side of O'Kane Court within the district's Swordspoint neighborhood.</p>
