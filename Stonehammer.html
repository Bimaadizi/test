<p>Doomguide Stonehammer was a priest of Kelemvor who lived in Neverwinter during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Stonehammer and several other doomguides were sent to investigate strange goings-on in the Pauper's Field area of Neverdeath Graveyard . A number of Red Wizards were luring the Kelemvorite priests into the cemetery as bait for use in their dark rituals to raise the undead .</p>
<p>Stonehammer was one of the priests to fall to the Thayans' devious plan, being raised as an undead creature himself. His undead form was put down by an adventurer a short time later, however, at the behest of his fellow doomguide, Volahk .</p>
