<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Originally from Zakhara , Jakkob was captured by Calishites while he was in hyena form for a private menagerie. He was able to eventually escape and reached the Lake of Steam region where he became the leader of a pack of natural hyenas after slaying their alpha in combat. Jakkob led the pack on raids against the Talu-min tribe, killing many of their herd animals in the process. The Talu-min eventually caught up to, and slew all of the hyenas, but Jakkob was once again able to escape with his life. He fled to Yhep where he led the town's dog on nightly hunts.</p>
