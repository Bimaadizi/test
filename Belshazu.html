<p>Belshazu was a glabrezu and the father of the draegloth Jeggred Baenre .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Belshazu was a glabrezu, so he had four arms (two with pincers) and a dog-like head. He was black-skinned and had yellow fangs with violet eyes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Belshazu was summoned to the material plane in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , by the wizard Pharaun Mizzrym . He and his group, led by Quenthel Baenre , wanted to know a way to get to the Demonweb Pits . Pharaun tricked the demon into a pool of frozen water instead of a summoning circle . Belshazu had to cut off his leg and leave it in the Material Plane to escape. He tried to get his revenge later when the wizard and his group traveled to the Abyss . However, he was ultimately slain by Pharaun with a wail of the banshee spell.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Belshazu possessed a ring of flying , which Pharaun took from him upon his death to replace the magical rapier ring that Belshazu had destroyed.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Triel Baenre mated with Belshazu in a Lolth -sanctioned ritual and subsequently bore the draegloth Jeggred Baenre, who was viewed as a sign of the goddess's favor. Quenthel Baenre apparently had her eyes on performing the same ritual with Belshazu, although that never came to fruition.</p>
