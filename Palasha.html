<p>Palasha was a mermaid who traveled with the Witchlight Carnival in its journeys across the Feywild and the planes beyond.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The mesmerizing mermaid sought to bring joy and beauty to the world through her singing. While she was seen as haughty and demanding, Palasha merely did not warm to others easily and had trouble showing genuine emotions. She had the bad habit of snapping her fingers at others when she desired something from them.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Palasha had the unique ability to shape the form of water by means of her operatic, singing voice.</p>
<p>Once per day, she could summon a swarm of kippers and control them for up to a minute's time.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>She spent much of her time lounging in a giant fishbowl by the Silversong Lake area of the carnival. When the carnival traveled from one locale to another, Palasha's fishbowl was carried a magnificent painted wagon.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Palasha was wholly in love with Candlefoot , the Witchlight Carnivals resident mime. The indecisive man once planned to propose to Palasha, but lost his voice shortly before he had the opportunity.</p>
