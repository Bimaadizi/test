<p>The Malatran Plateau was a mountainous land form in the center of the southern jungles of Malatra that was created by alien magic and rose thousands of feet above the rest of the region.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Like the rest of Malatra, the Malatran Plateau was covered mostly by jungle. In the north west and the north east however, there were large swathes of land that didn't have significant tree cover.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some of the earliest people to inhabit the land that would become the Malatran Plateau were bamboo and river spirit folk , who would later become an offshoot race known as the tam'hi .</p>
<p>Thousands of years before the Time of Troubles and before Abeir-Toril had split, a faction of a humanoid race known as the ancient Nubari had come on spelljammers in retreat from war in another crystal sphere , seeking a new place to call home. Viewing the central jungle of Maltra as undesirable to the natives, they used their magic to raise the ground and create the vast Malatran Plateau. Unbeknownst to them, this caused the underground homes of nearby korobokuru to collapse, forcing them above ground.</p>
<p>Vowing not to repeat the mistakes of their ancestors, they swore to create a society without war and to not interfere with the natural development of other species. The land's spirit folk chose to hide instead of greeting or troubling them and the timid shu chose to do the same. Thus these groups lived in harmony as the ancient Nubari worked to create a new utopia free of strife. The ancient Nubari built a long chain of magical domes around their territory, which generated a effect similar to the hallucinatory terrain spell , but with permanency and on a massive scale. They also wove powerful and permanent variations of the antipathy spell into the domes. Altogether this ensured that the plateau, as well as the domes that made this effect, would go unnoticed by the people below.</p>
<p>When garuda began decimiating the plateau's gorilla population, the ancient Nubari felt sorry for the creatures and decided to make them smarter. Giving them the capability of speech and the knowledge of making tools. When the garuda were eventually banished from the land, the ancients would go on to offer many saru jobs as laborers.</p>
<p>Eventually some disaster, whose exact details were unrecorded by history, struck the ancient Nubari and destroyed their civilization. Most of their buildings, culture, and knowledge was lost in this disaster. A legend passed down by members of the Simbara claimed that they were discovered and attacked by their ancient enemy. The surviving ancient Nubari would flee what was left of their homes, taking up life in the plateau's jungles and plains.</p>
<p>Years following the destruction of the ancient Nubari's civilization, some native Malatrans discovered the plateau. During this period the carnivorous dinosaurs that inhabited the jungles surrounding the plateau were experiencing a severe decline in population. These natives — consisting of humans, katangas , and korobokurus — somehow managed to ascend the vast plateau and overcome its magical barriers. These humans were related to those who would later become the Shou .</p>
<p>Those humans would intermingle with the ancient Nubari and over the course of thousands of years they descended into the modern Nubari . Later on, a group of scro came on spelljamming vessels to the Malatran Plateau, fleeing from their far off war with the Elven Imperial Fleet . And over time they descended into what would be known as the oscray .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The intelligent races that populated the Malatra Plateau included the Nubari, katanga, korobokuru, saru, shu, tam'hi , and oscray. With the Nubari, korobokuru, and shu living in tribes. The saru sometimes settled near Nubari villages and mimicked their habits, but never created tribes of their own. The tam'hi lived in clans of families rather than tribes.</p>
<p>The Nubari tribes were broad groups of villages tied by blood relation, with villages of the same tribe only rarely going to war with one another. Relations with the Nubari tribes and other races were generally good, with most Nubari considering all humans and demihumans to be people, though in some cases tribes only considered humans to be people. Almost all tribes considered korobokuru and shu to be people, with outcasts joining their tribes on rare occasions. Larger tribes were known to adopt even outcast katanga, tam'hi, and saru.</p>
<p>The more monstrous races that inhabited the plateau, known for often raiding the aforementioned peoples, included bullywugs , lizardfolk , mold men , a fresh water breed of sahuagin , tabaxi , tasloi , wemics , and yuan-ti .</p>
