<p>Veldyn "the Fingers" Uruin was a notorious thief of Telflamm in Thesk in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<p>When Chansreena (princess) Alabhansree Alanasker of Ormpur and her dowry went missing in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Veldyn was one of three thieves named as suspects by High Suikh (king) Helbareim Alanasker , but was innocent. Veldyn could well have gone looking for the real thief, perhaps deciding to have the loot as well as the blame.</p>
