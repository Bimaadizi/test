<p>Allendry was the brave captain of the Midnight Rose ship that sailed the Sea of Swords in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Allendry was a strong, tall, grey-skinned, one-eyed half-orc.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Allendry's trusted intelligent and sassy companion was his old talking parrot Polly who always recited limericks and jokes taught to him by the crew. His first mate – Nisar Zayid , was Allendry's most trusted crew member who often was in charge of the Rose when the captain was away.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Captain Allendry accepted a precious cargo and several passengers at the docks of Neverwinter . The priestess of Umberlee Tasina Alcrest was among them, along with an adventuring sailor, later known as the Eater-of-Garm , and a wizard with a powerful statue artifact excavated from the far-away Anauroch . The statue was an ancient item sought after by Umberlee, and cursed anyone touching it with terrifying visions of floods and tsunamis. The sailor named Martins was tasked with retrieving and loading the statue from the Silver Sails Trading Company but was utterly traumatized by visions. He refused to sail and drank instead. Captain Allendry sent the Eater-of-Garm and a fellow sailor Nisar Zayid to retrieve the item.</p>
<p>When the Rose departed the docks of Neverwinter, Tasina Alcrest demanded the statue be handed to her. When refused, she was adamant about taking it by force. Tasina summoned an army of sahuagin that slaughtered most of the crew, including Allendry. She captured the Midnight Rose , while Nisar and the Eater-of-Garm were the only lucky survivors.</p>
<p>Because of his hatred-filled death, Allendry wanted vengeance before he went to the Fugue Plane . Subsequently, his ghost entrusted the Eater-of-Garm with the captaincy of the Midnight Rose in exchange for the promise of bloody revenge.</p>
