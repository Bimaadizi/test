<p>The Cinnabar Wastes was a region of cold and arid badlands in northeast Vaasa . It was named for the reddish color of the local rock formations.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Wastes were located in the Vaasan central highlands. They were north of Telos City and the Clefts of Razack , and south of Castle Perilous and the Lugsaas Chain mountains. The region was crossed by a trail called The Reach .</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>The region was characterized by badlands, steep-sloped striated rock formations carved by the advancing and retreating of the Great Glacier . The rock of the area was distinctly reddish in color, varying from bright blood-red to dark purplish. The whole area was littered with massive boulders and fields of broken rocks and gravel.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>As a stretch of badlands, nothing of note grew in the area.</p>
<p>This region of central Vaasa had a reputation for being home to nothing but foul monsters. It was home to bulettes and chromatic dragons as well as many of the other cold-weather creatures common across northern Vaasa, including winter wolves , glacier snakes , white puddings , moon dogs , and yeti .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>As with most regions in Vaasa, goblinoids and giantkin made their homes in the area. A tribe of fog giant nomads hunted in the Wastes and had found a way to tame the local bulettes.</p>
