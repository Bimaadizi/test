<p>The Kimball family were the traditional Ffolk royalty of the Kingdom of Moray in the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Kimballs ruled Moray since at least the 11 th century DR . Like all royal families of the Moonshaes, the Kimballs traced their lineage to the Cymrych family of High Kings and Queens. However, following the decline of the Cymrych dynasty in the 10 th century DR, the kings and queens of Moray (like most other Ffolk noble families at the time) had allowed the spelling and pronunciation of their name to change.</p>
<p>A lord of the Kimball family founded Graystone on the island of Gwynneth in the Year of the Stag, 1304 DR , and the surrounding moorland was named in his honor .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Bloodbird, 1346 DR , King Dynnegall of Moray and all of his heirs were assassinated by Razfallow on the orders of Cyndre , thus ending the royal line.</p>
