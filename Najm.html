<p>Najm was the dashing god or goddess of adventure and curiosity of Zakhara . They were one of the eight Great Gods of the Land of Fate and wanted their followers to venture forth and make the unknown known. Najm's symbol was a single arrow pointed upward.</p>
<p>Najm was alternatively described as female or male. Like other Zakharan gods, they were above such concerns as alignment, as curiosity might drive an adventurer to seek out the corners of the earth to help those in need or a necromancer to defile the living and dead. Their church sought the hinterlands and heathen parts to spread Enlightenment .</p>
