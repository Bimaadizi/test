<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Alabaster Stonecrafts was an open-air workshop with tarps stretched overhead to offer some protection from the elements. The workshop's name was stamped on the tarp, announcing itself to passebys.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The workshop was run by dwarf twins who went by "Sister Alabaster" and "Brother Alabaster." The twins happily whistled as they chiselled at the stone. They enjoyed sniping teasing remarks at each other. On Kythorn 28 of the Year of the Purloined Statue, 1477 DR , Alabaster Stonecrafts was visited by Tav , an adventuring detective who was investigating a series of grizzly murders. One of the dead bodies was fished out of the River Chionthar , wrapped in a tarp taken from one of the workshops on Misty Court. Tav found the open-air stonemason's workshop, and the twins told the investigator of strange happenings that had been plaguing the nearby Cliffside Cemetery , claiming that the gravedigger â€“ Grom Skullsmash , was responsible for the. Or it were the ghosts if Brother Alabaster was to be believed.</p>
