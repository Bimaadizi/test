<p>The Seven Sentinels of Silvanus was a group of elemental guardians of the isle of Ilighôn off the coast of the Vilhon Reach .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The island of Ilighôn stood in the Sea of Fallen Stars , encircled by Eldath's Ring – a reef that protected the island and left only one opening for the ships to move through. The opening led to the bay and harbors of Sapra . The opening's length was a quarter of a mile, and the Seven Sentinels of Silvanus guarded it. The Seven Sentinels tiredly protected the island, never leaving their post. The Sentinels consisted of four water elementals and three air elementals who served Silvanus and the Emerald Enclave – masters of the island.</p>
<p>Each of the elements was a hulking creature of 17 feet (5.2 meters). They were fanatically fearless and were powerful enough to easily overturn a seafaring vessel weighing up to 16 tons. Air and water elementals could prevent unwanted ships from entering Sapra's bay by catching them in squalls and whirlpools, keeping them in place. Commonly used tactics of the Seven Sentinels were the water elementals keeping ships in place, while air elementals used their winds to crash the ships into each other. The creatures were also protected from magics that could control elementals and from being banished from the Prime Material plane .</p>
<p>The Seven Sentinels of Silvanus were not just powers of destruction. They were tasked with saving drowning sailors and sinking ships. The elementals also guided friendly ships away from the Eldath's Ring and into the safety of Ilighôn's harbors.</p>
