<p>The Citadel of Protection was a grand temple of Helm located in the Temple District of Ravens Bluff . It took up an entire city block between De Villars Ride , Blacktree Boulevard and Raven Way , within the district's Altarside neighborhood and soared into the sky.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Citadel was an awesome, circular keep that, at first glance, resembled a city armory or grand governing building. The immensely-tall stronghold featured a central turret that ascended well above the city's skyline, perhaps the highest spot within all the Bluff. The exterior of the spire had an observation area complete with giant, brass -framed lenses that allowed for a closer view of the cityscape from the lofty vantage point.</p>
