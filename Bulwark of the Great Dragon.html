<p>The Bulwark of the Great Dragon was a unique enchanted tower shield created out of bones and scaled of an ancient dragon by Darson sometime before 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The shield possessed potent defensive +6 enchantments and allowed the wielder to expel fire dragon's breath three times per day.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The shield's creator, Darson, bragged about killing the ancient dragon himself, using its body to create the Bulwark of the Great Dragon . Such an outlandish claim was believed by very few, however. Most believed that the blacksmith simply came across a body of a slain wyrm and salvaged materials for the enchanted tower shield.</p>
<p>By 1373 DR , the Bulwark of the Great Dragon found its way to Hillsfar of the Moonsea region.</p>
