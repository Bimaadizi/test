<p>Cylla Morieth was a magic instructor in Lyrabar on 1373 DR and a Wearer of Purple for the Cult of the Dragon .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Middle-aged and with impish features, Cylla had brown curls frosted with golden highlights.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>It frustrated Cylla endlessly that she was forced to curtsey to nobles and priests in Impiltur , which was part of why she joined the Cult of the Dragon, hoping to bring about a world more favorable to her. She met interrogations with fatalism.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>By Uktar 9 of 1372 DR , Cylla could not yet cast wall of force . On Ches 2 of 1373 DR , she cast an illusion to fool Taegan Nightwind into an ambush, for which she acquired the aid of several abishai , presumably with magic. In the same fight, she employed some legerdemain to steal the avariel 's strength from a device, and then a different spell to escape, presumably dimension door . On Ches 14 of that same year amongst other spells, Cylla could cast steeldance , shadow spray and a spell that broke a silence spell, almost certainly dispel silence</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>On Uktar 9, Cylla Morieth employed a wall of force scroll, brought to her by Sammaster . On Ches 2, Cylla Morieth was in possession of at least 10,000 golden lions , with which she meant to bribe Taegan Nightwind for the return of Sammaster 's notes as the Wearer of Purple.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Besides being a magic instructor, Cylla Morieth was the Wearer of Purple for the local cell of the Cult of the Dragon.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Cylla Morieth was already a member of the Cult of the Dragon when she joined Sammaster on a trip, on Uktar 9, 1372 DR. Before the Cult, she was just a teacher of minor magic employed to safeguard ships at sea.</p>
<p>After Gorstag Helder stole Sammaster's notes and took them to Taegan Nightwind , she attempted to buy them off of him, and then bully them off of him, on Ches 2 of 1373 DR. The Cult of the Dragon set fire to his academy in the night, sent abishai into it, and cast spells to prevent anyone from waking up, presumably on her orders, in Ches 12 of the same year.</p>
<p>She was captured by Taegan Nightwind's party while in some catacombs beneath Lyrabar on Ches 14 . After some interrogation, she relayed upon them what she had experienced with Sammaster on Uktar 9 of the previous year, in the Gray Forest . As the maestro vowed to reveal her involvement in the Cult, she was forced to flee Impiltur, never to be seen again.</p>
