<h2>History</h2>
<p>After completion of construction of Seldarine's Hand circa the Year of the Thirsty Sword, 900 DR , the inhabitants of the citadel lived in a close alliance with the dwarves of Dorn's Deep. The troops of the elven citadel were outfitted with the best armor and weapons created by the crafters of both races. By the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , the Seldarine's Hand had been ruined for centuries and came to be known as the Severed Hand. After the citadel's fall, the Argent Shield remained within the ruins, discard by invading orcs and goblins as trash due to its magical attainment. Maiden Ilmadia Bariel , who served Ilmatari priest Revered Brother Poquelin , reclaimed the enchanted shield from the Hand's ruins and bore it until her death in 1281 DR at the hands of the Heroes of Icewind Dale .</p>
