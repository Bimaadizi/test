<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Gurn's Great Gnomeflinger was proudly displayed in the High House of Wonders of Baldur's Gate next to another famous deviceâ€” Baldric's Brilliant Blamblower . Both gadgets were considered an inspiration for young gnomish inventors and something to strive for. Young Purfbin Doogrick once attempted to create an invention he thought to be as grand as Gurn's Great Gnomeflinger. However, his Shred-o-Matic 1000 caused shame and destruction in his family's burrow instead.</p>
