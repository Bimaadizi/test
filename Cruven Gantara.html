<p>As of the 1480s DR , Cruven was believed to have been the last person to travel through the portal on Tuern that linked the island to the mainland of Faer√ªn . Around that same time the portal was highly sought after by the Cult of the Dragon, as they sought entrance to the Flame Fault in order to acquire the Red Dragon Mask .</p>
