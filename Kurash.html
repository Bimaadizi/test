<h2>History</h2>
<p>In early Eleint of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Kurash was among a group of Sharptooths captured by Shadowscales and held prisoner in the tower of the Lost Refuge in the Vast Swamp, along with chieftain Gathan , Ashala , Gruss , and Sithen . The ordeal left them weary and emaciated. They were presumably rescued by adventurers in service to Mystra investigating Sharran activities there.</p>
