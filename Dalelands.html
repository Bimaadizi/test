<p>The Dalelands , also referred to as the Dales , was a region in north Faerûn of dense forests and bountiful, rolling farmlands. It comprised a loosely-organized group of countries called dales that were as diverse as they were independent.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Dalelands were located around and partially within the Cormanthor forest, west of the Sea of Fallen Stars . They were neighbored to the southwest by the kingdom of Cormyr , to the south by the nation of Sembia , and to northwest by the Desertsmouth Mountains and beyond them the Anauroch desert.</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>While the various dales shared a similar culture, alike lifestyles and aligned relationships with nearby powers, they were not a unified nation like nearby Cormyr and Sembia . Each dale was an independent territory with its own unique government, military, industry and culture. However, the people were largely independent, self-reliant and had collectively enjoyed an age-old alliance with the elves of Cormanthyr , in thanks to the Dales Compact .</p>
<p>Travelers visiting the Dalelands might see the folk as reserved, suspicious or even as "country bumpkins". They were a quiet people who typically preferred to remain civil, silent and deliberate about someone's character until they were well enough known to be accepted as a friend, or even an ally. Once this trust was earned, friends of the Dalesfolk would find them to be quite open and generous.</p>
<p>Farming, craftsmanship and commerce were all highly valued throughout the dales. Honest and hearty, the Dalesfolk had firmly-held beliefs that their industriousness and virtue would overcome any foreign schemes and exotic magic that attempted to sway their land.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>First and foremost the Dalelands were a loose confederation of small towns. The one thing they were not, and perhaps have never been, was a unified kingdom. Each dale maintained their own militia and government, whether a lordship like Shadowdale or a republic led by groups such as the Swords of Archendale .</p>
<p>However, representatives from each dale would meet together once a year in Midwinter to discuss issues related to trade, relations with other nations, and inter-border disputes at the Dales Council . While the debates would often dissolve into pointless arguing and bickering, in the face of a common foe, such as attempted annexations by Sembia or the discovery of Zhentarim schemes, the dales would band together as a unified force. The council could also be called in the face of an emergency that threatened the region as a whole.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Trade was an important, and often unifying, force among the various dales. The main exports of the Dalelands were raw products and materials, such as timber and seafood from Archendale, livestock, cheese and grain from Battledale , or copper from High Dale . The Dalelands were essentially considered the breadbasket of the Western Heartlands .</p>
<p>The exception to this dynamic was Tasseldale , which was a land of primarily craftsmen and traders, taking a cue from their neighbor Sembia, and primarily exported fine goods like pottery and textiles. Conversely, these fine goods, including metalwork, jewelry and finished products like paper, glassware and clothing were usually highest in demand within the other dales. These goods were procured from nearby cities such as Arabel , Suzail and Marsember in Cormyr, Hillsfar from the Moonsea region and Selgaunt and Ordulin , when it was still a city of Sembia.</p>
<p>In addition, the Dalelands acted as a crossroads of trade. Although their people cared little for foreign affairs, their strategic location between other powers in the region was undeniable.</p>
<p>The Dales were famous for a strong-willed breed of working pony, called the Dales pony . On average they cost 120 gp .</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>Considering how the Dalelands were located at a crossroads between a number of different powerful human nations, city-states and even the renewed kingdom of the elves the fact their lands were brought to the attention of a several of the Realms' most influential powers came as little surprise. Among these groups were:</p>
<p>The elves of Cormanthyr north of the Dalelands helped forge a friendship and fledgling alliance of nations long before the people of the Dales were a semblance of an impactful society. The Dalesfolk and the elves have maintained a respectful friendship over the centuries, even following the Retreat . Even though the Dales Compact did not stand for centuries between its initial iteration and its reformation in the 15 th century, the men of the dales knew to not challenge the ancient elven laws regarding the sanctity of the forest.</p>
<p>The typically secretive group of benevolent spies and agents known as the Harpers shared an similar outlook of the world with the Dalesfolk. The Harpers could operate more freely in the dales than they could usually get away with. They also counted many local leaders among their ranks including Mourngrym Amcathra , Storm Silverhand and even Elminster , who was famously known as the Sage of Shadowdale. Shadowdale indeed was home a great number of Harpers.</p>
<p>The Zhentarim were arguably the most infamous and deadly of groups that the Dalelands would collectively declare as their enemy. Throughout the ages, the Zhentarim have spied on, maneuvered against, raided and outright invaded the dales, resulting in no small feat of the outright destruction of Teshendale , and intermittent occupations in Shadowdale and Daggerdale.</p>
<p>Along with these larger groups the Dalelands were home to a few more localized ones such as the pegasi -mounted Flying Auxiliary that guarded High Dale, the Silver Ravens of Sembia who led operations from Scardale Town, and the Stellar Fellowship , an adventuring society based out of New Velar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Origins</h3>
<p>The smattering of human settlers that huddled in small villages at the edges of Cormanthor and Cormanthyrian led by Coronal Eltargrim Irithyl came to an agreement known as the Dales Compact. The conditions of this pact gave the future-Dalesfolk non-forested, and non-elven claimed areas of land on which to settle and ceased any and all logging efforts deeper into the forest. Furthermore, the Standing Stone was erected as a monument to this new alliance between elf and man. This turning point in both civilizations also marked the beginning of the Dale Reckoning calendar for centuries to come.</p>
<p>One of the most famous milestones in Harper lore occurred in the Dancing Place within High Dale on Flamerule 26 , in the Year of the Dawn Rose, 720 DR . The Gathering of the Gods was a widely-celebrated event where good-aligned deities spoke directly through their respective priests on Toril . This event led to the reformation of the Harpers, which was all but wiped out some six years prior.</p>
<p>In response to the growing threat of orcish tribes near the Dalelands, Aencar Burlisk was the Warlord of Battledale in the Year of Warlords, 1030 DR . Over the next decade he would declare himself as King of the Dales, unite the Dalelands to defeat the common threat, and vigilantly defend them from others. Regrettably, he was slain in the Year of Singing Shards, 1044 DR by a dracolich that was summoned while he feasted. The undead dragon, and its summoner Alacanther , were defeated by Aencar's officers, and his body was interred in his manor and set alight. The Dalelands were split into independent communities that maintained somewhat an alliance through the Dales Council .</p>
<h3>Civil Wars</h3>
<p>When the Dusk Lord of Sessrendale was suspected of corrupting the Dalelands with dark magic and pillaging caravans with monsters and evil marauders, the Dalesfolk of Archendale took action. The first civil war took place over three weeks in the Year of the Weeping Wives, 1232 DR , when the forces of Archendale assailed, and eventually annihilated the Dusk Lord and his mages. The Three Swords then salted the earth of the dale so that nothing more could grow from its soil.</p>
<p>The second war-between-dales fell under attempts of the Lord of Scardale , Lashan Aumersair to reunite Dalelands under a common banner in the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR . His forces managed to defeat Featherdale, Battledale and Harrowdale but were eventually stopped at Mistledale by a coalition of Dales powers and united soldiers from Cormyr, Hillsfar, Sembia and even Zhentil Keep . This defeat resulted in over a decade of occupation and influence from the governments of these respective powers.</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , The Dales Compact was renewed between the crusading Seiveril Miritar of Evereska and the untied lands of Battledale, Deepingdale, Mistledale and Shadowdale.</p>
<p>The Cormanthor War of the same year resulted in the invasion of Battledale and Shadowdale but ended with a hopeful outlook for the latter. Lord Mourngrym Amcathra was freed and lordship of the dale was passed on to Alazar Falconhand .</p>
<h3>Conflict with Sembia</h3>
<p>Throughout 15 th century DR , the Dalelands had become a focal point for several neighboring nations, all vying for control over its land and people. Tasseldale was overrun, Featherdale was annexed and the government of Archendale was discovered to have betrayed their people to Sembian coin.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>These large, densely populated countries featured large cities that often had dealings with foreign powers. Their citizens were notably more urbane than their cousins from the rustic dales.</p>
<p>These straddled the line between the larger, more influential dales and the more rural ones.</p>
<p>These lands were quiet, often pastoral lands, that held true to their farming roots. They featured freeholds of large farms, small hamlets and quaint villages.</p>
<h3>Fallen dales</h3>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In addition to their verdant valleys, that were rich with wheat, oat, and a variety of vegetables; the Dalelands were abundant with wildlife including game, fish and fowl. Sheep, pigs and cattle were often raised in the farmlands and the fields and forests were rich with rabbits, deer , bears and even woodchucks and porcupines.</p>
<p>Regions located further out from settlements, along the fringes of the dales, contained trolls and bands of bugbears .</p>
