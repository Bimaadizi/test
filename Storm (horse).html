<p>Storm was a roan mare that served as the mount of Captain Halloran of the Golden Legion in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Halloran rode Storm into battle against Akbet-Khrul and his pirates in the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR , during the Golden Legion's campaign. In the Golden Legion's expedition to Maztica in the same year, Storm was transported to the continent on the Legion's ship Osprey . Storm was taken by Halloran's rival Alvarro after the latter replaced Halloran as head of the lancers following the legion's arrival at Ulatos . Alvarro rode the horse into battle against the Payit and brutally rode down many Mazticans on the horse, both warriors and civilians. During the battle, Halloran ambushed Alvarro and reclaimed Storm from him. He used the horse to rescue the Nexalan woman Erixitl from the battle.</p>
<p>Later when Erixitl and Halloran were attacked by the drow Ancient One Spirali along with his hell hounds , Storm ran away, but was later recovered by Halloran. Halloran took the mare across Maztica to Nexal where the people saw a horse for the first time to their amazement. The horse was taken care of by Nexalan slaves given by Naltecona , the Revered Counselor.</p>
