<p>Garoll was a commoner and a frequent customer at the Copper Coronet in Athkatla 's River District in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Garoll was a human male with fair skin and brown hair who was fond green garments.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Garoll could often be found drinking at the Copper Coronet. He drunkenly tried to befriend strangers asked them to buy him a drink. He was also overly-talkative about Coronet's "special" entertainment offered by the proprietor at the time, Lehtinan . When Garoll came into coin we wanted to partake in the tavern's backroom gambling on dog fights, illegal and deadly gladiatorial fights, opium trade, and prostitution.</p>
