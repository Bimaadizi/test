<p>Iltkazar (the Mithral Kingdom ) was a subterranean dwarven realm, originally one of the eight sub-kingdoms of Shanatar , and known for its stone carving and engineering. The term "Iltkazar" came to describe more than just the original sub-kingdom, and by −1900 DR it was used to describe a sub-kingdom of Calimshan . The Shanataran sub-kingdoms of Barakuir , Drakkalor , Holorarar and Ultoksamrin were located in Iltkazar, as well as Zokir , City of Orbs.</p>
<p>As of 1371 DR, Iltkazar was mainly inhabited by shield dwarves, although populations of humans, rock gnomes, svirfneblin and urdunnirin also existed.</p>
<p>In its prime, Iltkazar had an estimated population of 7,506 (mostly shield dwarves ) and was ruled by a silver dragon known as King Mith Barak the Clanless , who spent seventy-five out of every hundred years sitting still as a solid mithral statue on his throne. During this time, the Regency Council of Iltkazar ruled the city. It was probably the best defended city in the Underdark .</p>
<p>In 1367 DR King Mith Barak's astral form was captured by Tiamat and he was only released in 1477 DR . During his absence the city was ruled by regents.</p>
