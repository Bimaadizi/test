<p>Lundeth , also known as the City of Whirring Waters , was a large city found in northern Thindol on the Chultan Peninsula .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Lundeth sat at the northern end of the Thingulph along the banks of the River Lundeth in the foothills of the Hazur Mountains .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Lundeth was known for its wondrous machinery, some of which was capable of producing up to 100 swords per day. Sadly the quality of items produced by the machinery was lacking, making weapons much more prone to breaking. Efforts were made continually to improve the process.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>As of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , a small number of gold dwarf expatriates from Lantan and missionary priests of Gond settled in Lundeth.</p>
