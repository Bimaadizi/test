<p>The River Scelptar was a large river that flowed from the Qurth Forest in the northeast of the Border Kingdoms to the Shining Sea in the southwest. The mouth of the river was called simply Scelptarmouth .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The River Scelptar spanned a distance of approximately 300 miles (480,000 meters). The River Rith was a tributary from the north, connecting about 100 miles (160,000 meters) inland.</p>
<p>Seasonal flooding occurred in the river every spring.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>In the marshy depths of Scelptar north of Dapplegate, a great deal of lizardfolk and mudmaws inhabited the river. The two groups regularly fought each other for supremacy over the water. Additionally, Oeblaun fishermen often told stories of freshwater pikes and eels dwelling in the Scelptar's waters, ones large enough to swallow a human whole, but these were likely nothing but talltales.</p>
<h2>Settlements on the River</h2>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>A lot of goods traveled through the River Scelptar by means of barges and small ships, numbering among the primary sea routes of the Shining Sea. Due to dangers in its marshy areas, six mercenary companies stationed in Dapplegate were dedicated to escorting bargebound shipments.</p>
