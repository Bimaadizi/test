<p>Gomen was a village located in Miyama Province in Kozakura .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gomen, the Tara-gawa Basin 's largest fishing village, was situated on terraced slopes by the shore of Miumi . It featured a harbor capable of accommodating ocean-going vessels. The village was a hive of activity for the region, with three hundred buildings, predominantly minka and godowns .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Fishing and boat-building were the cornerstones of Gomen's economy. Fishermen engaged in the lucrative trade of drying and salting the daily catch for export. The village's shipwrights were esteemed for their craftsmanship, frequently commissioned by wealthy merchants and local lords to construct robust sea vessels.</p>
<p>Beyond these primary industries, Gomen boasted a diverse range of facilities: two smithies, an armorer, a sake brewery, two inns, a gambling house, two temples, a shrine, a weaving establishment, and several carpentry workshops. Additionally, a local merchant operated a modest shipping business with a warehouse and three ships, primarily transporting agricultural produce to Tamanokuni and Kuda .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Strategically positioned at the junction of two shoen , one owned by the Hori clan and the other by the Tsu family , Gomen became a focal point of interest for both families, owing to its significant economic potential. However, the village recently acquired a special charter from the shugo-daimyo, which exempted it from the jurisdiction of these estates in exchange for direct tax payments to the shugo-daimyo, placing Gomen under the Niwa family's administration.</p>
<p>As of Kozakuran Year 1430 (1356 DR) , the village was overseen by the samurai Matsue Fusu .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>A small defensive contingent comprising five samurai and fifteen bushi ensured Gomen's safety and kept order.</p>
