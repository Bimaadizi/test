<p>The Karsus Butte was the petrified remains of the Momentary God Karsus , the Netherese arcanist that achieved godhood for a single moment.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The mesa-like rock formation was made up of coarse, red sandstone shaped in the twisted form of a colossal human on its back. The mound that comprised Karsus' head, which held the features of the former-god's visage including his prominent nose and weak chin, gave way to a depressed chest and rounded belly that formed the butte's highest point. Karsus's stone arms remained crooked at a naturally impossible angle.</p>
<p>Wild magic radiated outward from the Butte, extending out to Karse and the surrounding Dire Wood.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It lay within the Dire Wood region of the eastern High Forest . The city of Karse was built at the "foot" of the fallen god.</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>Karsus' Butte was the source of the Heartblood River , the foaming red-hued waterway that flowed westward through the forest.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The butte was formed immediately after Karsus's Folly in the Year of Sundered Webs, −339 DR , when Karsus was destroyed a moment after achieving apostheosis and his godly remains plummeted down to Toril .</p>
<p>On Hammer 1 in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Galaeron Nihmedu used magic from a powerful artifact taken from within the Karsus Butte to summon the Return of the Netherese enclave of Thultanthar to Faerûn from the plane of Shadow .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>The single notable structure atop the Karsus Butte was the Shrine of the Undying Heart , a temple built atop the butte dedicated to the Momentary God. An illusory passageway within led to a chamber at the heart of the temple, within which lay the dead god's still-beating heart , the only source of whole magic in all the Realms.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Karsus Butte was considered a holy site by the cultists that worshiped him.</p>
