<p>The Wheloon natives were a group of Wheloon Prisoners in the late 15 th century DR . They were made up of those innocent Whelunites who were caught in the creation of the prison, with no ties to crime or Sharran worship.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The group was led by Seth Wentalle , and Georg Vallis served as a trader of sorts. The Morninglords who attended the prison worked with the natives whenever possible.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Wheloon natives lived in two main areas. The first was a compound attached to Harvest Hall that had a large wooden palisade and barricades, and grew crops in garden beds to support the group. The second was a scattering of camps and crude settlements hidden in the Wheloon drainage culverts , which also grew mushrooms . While Harvest Hall was secure, the underground was far less safe and depended more on its obscurity to survive.</p>
<p>The priestess of Amaunator Karie Leddle knew of secret sewer passages to more easily reach them at Harvest Hall, and her fellow priestess Adara Semple used Harvest Hall as a base for her crusade against darkness.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the city was turned into a prison in 1473 DR by King Foril , an unknown but sizable number of innocent people were trapped within the walls alongside the Sharrans . Without the ability to plead their case, they organized around the temple of Chauntea , the Harvest Hall, and set about protecting themselves from the more violent Sharrans and other criminals that were placed alongside them.</p>
<p>Around the time of the Shadovar invasion of Wheloon , the Wheloon natives were hard-pressed as the balance of power was upset and the other criminal gangs began looking for easy targets. A gang led by Porto , Athea , and Aramiya Troise took aim at the natives and sought to overrun their camps in the Wheloon sewers . Before they managed this, the Purple Dragon knight Faline Abbot sent reinforcements from outside the prison to investigate, ultimately defeating the Troise gang and saving the natives.</p>
<p>Though the criticism of the prison intensified, it took until Lady Marsheena 's conquest of the city in 1486 DR for the locals to be freed.</p>
