<p>The Claws of the Jade Panther were gloves that were used as a deadly weapon by the infamous Shou monk only known as the Jade Panther .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Each glove had three razor-sharp claw-shaped blades attached to them. Specifically designed to be worn by monks , these gloves allowed them not only to shower their opponents with bludgeoning fist punches but also slash them open with the gloves' blades.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally owned by the Jade Panther, these gloves were stolen by Li Mai , the Panther's lover. She felt that the Panther became too cruel and ordered one of her servants to destroy the Claws . However, the gloves were sold on a black market instead. Eventually, in the late 14 th century DR , the Claws were exported out of Shou Lung and were sold at Okuzo's Imports of Westgate .</p>
