<h2>History</h2>

In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Basillus murdered a significant number of innocent people, including Footy 's family and Netty 's father. He raised them as undead zombies and skeletons , believing them to be the family which he had lost before.</p>
<p>That same year, Governor Kelddath Ormlyr of Beregost placed a 5,000 gp bounty on Basillus' head. He tasked those who sought to stop the murderous cleric with the return of his holy symbol .</p>
