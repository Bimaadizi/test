<p>"Lady" Alyth Elendara was the Elfsong Tavern bartender and owner during the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Lady Alyth was charming and charismatic; she was widely praised for her stew and patrons of the Elfsong, who would gladly aid her if she was threatened. Lady Alyth also maintained an unofficial bank for her patrons. Most of her business in this regard was through sailors engaged in shady dealings.</p>
<p>She believed that her tavern was a refuge for the less recognized civilians of Baldur's Gate . These patrons were willing to defend themselves with their blades, if necessary, and stood against thievery. Alyth noted that this rule was as successful as it was not. Lady Elendara, though not the bartender, was happy to sell a variety of beverages to customers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>

<p>In 1419 DR , she had a son named Alan . After a few decades she passed down proprietorship of the Elfsong to him, along with the family money-lending business.</p>
