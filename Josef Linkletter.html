<p>Josef Linkletter was a male human living in Neverwinter in 1479 DR . He was a member of the Neverwinter Guard before he became involved in the plots of Rhazzad .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Josef was a native-born of Neverwinter who had been born in the grim years after the Spellplague .</p>
<p>In 1473 DR , he was a journeyman stone mason when he met the architect Dorothea Nacht . Dorothea and Josef soon fell in love and married. Meanwhile, after a brush with the law, Josef was recruited into the Neverwinter Guard by Sergeant Knox . Josef soon made a name for himself as a principled and fair man who could talk sense to even the most desperate outlaw, and fought with distinction against the Many-Arrows orcs and the Blackdagger Bandits .</p>
<p>However, in 1479 , illness clouded the Linkletters' happiness: Dorothea became afflicted by the spellplague and the malady kept the formerly outgoing woman in her home for months. Out of desperation, Dorothea and Josef approached the unorthodox wizard Rhazzad , known for studying the matter. He gave Dorothea a potion that seemingly controlled the illness, though she sometimes transformed into a monster when she became highly emotional and only more of Rhazzad's medicine could restore her.</p>
<p>After one violent episode, Josef recruited the Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge to transport his wife to the wizard's tower for more regular treatment. In truth, however, Rhazzad sought not to cure the plaguechanged victims in his tower but to exploit their nature for power. When the truth was revealed Josef Linkletter attacked his tower, but was transformed into a monster himself.</p>
<p>After the Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge killed Rhazzad and freed Dorothea and Josef from his control, the two joined Scar Company to protect the city from the threats within the Chasm .</p>
<p>Years later Josef had not only been promoted to Captain but had begun to recover, his monstrous form slowly starting to return to a human shape. When the Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge brought him a pair of scrolls written by the Cloaked Ascendancy with spellplague magic, Josef deciphered them and determined that the Cloaked Ascendancy intended to unleash the Far Realm itself upon the city.</p>
