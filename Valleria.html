<p>Valleria was a Netherese fighter , wife of Chanragoupta and later Cadogen , who lived in Eileanar around 3520 NY (−339 DR) .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>While she was married to Chanragoupta, the thief Cadogen was caught during a burglary. Chanragoupta intended to have the thief hanged at the next dawn, but instead Cadogen escaped his bonds, Valleria fell in love with him, and the pair fled together. To cover their tracks, they pretended that Valleria had been kidnapped and held for ransom, resulting in Chanragoupta paying the full 20,000 gp ransom to no result. Valleria never returned and Chanragoupta feared her to be dead, though he maintained a standing 5,000 gp reward for her safe return. Unbeknownst to him, Valleria and Cadogen had married and had two children together, with Cadogen even becoming a respected constable at Constabulary Branch Three in Eileanar, the same city as Chanragoupta's Exotic .</p>
