<p>The Weave , controlled by Mystryl or one of her successors, was a way through which raw magic was accessed, tapped into and used by casters of magic . The Weave was the way in which magic presented itself to beings for their use, and it flowed throughout the world , touching almost every corner of existence, with exception of dead-magic zones . The Weave coexisted with the Shadow Weave .</p>
<h2>Nature of the Weave</h2>
<p>The Weave was considered many things, including Mystra 's body, the source of magic, all the studies of casters, arcane and divine alike, and the many energies and forces that existed around the planes . Many saw it as a "fabric" on which magic was "drawn", and damaging the fabric caused magic to go awry. Preparing a spell was a means by which a small amount of the Weave could be "contained" and transported for a specific effect, while the casting of a spell was equivalent to telling the Weave to rearrange itself to create the effect.</p>
<p>Importantly, the Weave was not magic itself, but rather a force by which its flows could be channeled, and a means by which magic could be understood and harnessed. In the years after the Spellplague , the term Weave also became a synonym of the use of magic, although this was not true either. Other systems for calling upon magic had always existed within the Realms, but the Weave was by far the most commonly used, thoroughly refined and best understood.</p>
<p>The Weave was also linked to fate, and a rare few individuals could manipulate such connection to alter the future to their advantage. However, usually the Weave punished those who used "her" in such a way.</p>
<p>Spellfire was the raw magical energy of the Weave. Some people had the rare talent for manipulate this underlying energy directly, producing many magical effects. Silver fire was a similar ability granted by Mystra only to the Chosen of Mystra that enabled its users to envelop themselves in silvery white flames that bestowed many potent magical powers.</p>
<p>Some textbooks deliberately falsified the nature of the Weave, as an attempt to limit the knowledge associated with spellcasting. One book that correctly outlined the nature of the Weave was Magic of the Weave , although its wizard author demonstrated a clear bias towards his own form of spellcasting.</p>
<p>The relationship between Mystra and the Weave was roughly analogous to different parts of a body, Mystra being the brain that has degrees of control over the heart that is the Weave.</p>
<h3>Special Practitioners</h3>
<p>Elves of the Realms were born with a natural and special bond to the Weave.</p>
<h2>The Weave Across Reality</h2>
<p>The Weave did not extend across all reality. For example, it did not exist on Abeir , making casting magic in that world more difficult than in Toril . At the same time, many other worlds and planes have Weaves of magic, yet they are not the same as the Weave of Toril and Realmspace . Other realms had their own natural cycles of energy and magic, and thus their own Weaves.</p>
<p>Weave-based spellcraft functioned even on worlds with a Weave different to the caster's own. Every mortal spellcaster or magic-item wielder called upon tiny amounts of their original Weave stored within themselves or their items, and could do so until they exhausted that power source. Afterwards, a caster on another plane of existence (such as the Outer Planes ), would have to regain their spells and other magical energies by calling on the Weave of their current plane to power them.</p>
<p>The spells gained from different Weaves could have subtle differences, even if cast on one's plane of origin or if carried to another plane and cast there. For example, when working with the Weave of Avernus , first of the Nine Hells , spells that conjure hands, like mage hand or bigby's hand , might instead create fiendish claws; spells that find things, like find familiar or find the path , may call forth an imp to do the desired tasks; and telepathic communication may be accompanied by vague whispers and the feeling of being watched, whether or not an archdevil or other infernal presence is listening in.</p>
<p>The Weave of Realmspace could be brought into other planes, such as by Mystra (who was the Weave) entering a given plane herself. In this case the Torillian Weave would be present, but as an aura enfolded tightly around the goddess unable to operate reliably beyond her. The Chosen of Mystra were also known to carry their own tiny cycle of the Weave within themselves, which they could send parts of throughout the planes of existence to rejoin the "parent Weave". These small parts of the Weave hold the potential to be "tainted" by extraplanar influences, and thus permanently lost to Mystra. More dangerous is the possibility that insidious influences could be implanted in the wayward cycles of magic, through which the masters of other planes could influence the Weave.</p>
<p>There is also the broader issue of instability that comes when two Weaves meet, for the resultant clashing can open planar rifts. The violent collision between and roiling mixing of the energy flows of two planes causes wild magic to be ever-present. Similarly spread across the planes will be the tendency of the fabrics of both to try and knit themselves back together and seal the breach, usually after many elements and creatures from both have "leaked" into the other.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Spellplague</h3>
<p>Because Mystra (and formerly Mystryl ) was inextricably bound to the Weave (one cannot exist without the other), when Mystra was assassinated by Cyric and Shar on Tarsakh 29 1385 DR , the Weave collapsed and initiated the Spellplague. Henceforth, it presented itself as scraps of burning crystal tumbling through an endless void. With the death of Mystra, Shar was unable to maintain the Shadow Weave and it collapsed as well.</p>
<p>In 1479 DR it was revealed that Mystra foresaw her own fall and let it happen because the Weave was growing more and more unstable, and needed to be renewed as part of a cycle fated to repeat again and again. In 1487 DR the Weave was almost repaired to its former state.</p>
<h2>Phenomena</h2>
<h3>Dead Magic Zones</h3>
<p>Dead magic zones were places where the Weave was no longer in existence. Both it and its boundaries could be detected in the same way a wild magic zone could, but from outside the zone. Unlike wild magic zones, most casters innately knew when they've stepped into a dead magic zone. A dead magic zone could only be fixed with a wish spell or silver fire.</p>
<h3>Everywhere but Evermeet</h3>
<p>When the elves caused the First Sundering , they did almost destroy everything, which the timely intervention of the Seldarine limited to the destruction of a continent.</p>
<p>Alongside sundering the continent of Faer√ªn , they ripped the Weave in an irrecoverable manner beyond its self-repairing capabilities with the parts in Evermeet being the only whole parts of it, turning it into the only normal Weave to exist, and thus causing no abnormalities to exist on that island.</p>
<p>According to Corellon Larethian , the elves robbed themselves of the ability to cast true elven high magic outside of Evermeet and people such as the Grand Master Laeroth Runemaster suspected in the 13th century DR, that their ancestors did indeed destroy the entire elven race's special connection to the Weave when they caused the disaster.</p>
<h3>Shadow Magic</h3>
<p>Certain practitioners of shadow magic could create a form of "dimensional twisting" from shadowstuff . By creating a barrier in this manner, a shadow mage could prevent anyone from passing through a designated area, and cut off access to the Weave for anyone within.</p>
<h3>Wild Magic Zones</h3>
<p>In wild magic zones, a spell could backfire upon its caster, target the wrong location, be dramatically increased in power, or many other things. A wild magic zone and its parameters could be detected using a detect magic spell. A caster could temporarily fix a wild magic zone with any dispel or permanently fix it using a wish spell.</p>
<p>Cosmic disasters like the Time of Troubles caused the emergence of severe wild magic zones after the Weave was heavily damaged. After the Time of Troubles, most wild magic zone disappeared but some remained.</p>
<p>Another source of wild magic zones were the artificial distortions of the Weave called mythals . Apart from decay due to neglected maintenance, events such as the Fall of Netheril or the Time of Troubles damaged them. The damage turned these corrupted mythals into - even by wild magic standards - unpredictable wild magic zones.</p>
<h3>Weave whispers</h3>
<p>Weave whispers were echoes of utterances, repeated as a byproduct of uncontrolled magic.</p>
