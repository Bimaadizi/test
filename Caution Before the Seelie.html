<p>Caution Before the Seelie was an anthropological and autobiographical work on the place of the Beastlands published sometime in or before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This exceedingly rare tome of lore was grimy and covered in dust with yellow feathers and tufts of black fur pressed between its pages. The book also contained a scroll of bestial communion that allowed a mage to scribe the sights of the Seelie: summon deva spell .</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>Caution Before the Seelie was a collection of accounts of one unfortunate hin who, during a tour of the Beastlands, was forced into joining the Seelie Court . The book also collected lore on the Seelie Courts of summer, winter, and sarcastic octopus . However, the last one was not entirely accurate nor reliable.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the presumed original copy of Caution Before the Seelie was storred within a study, hidden by an illusory wall in the vaults of the Ramazith's tower of Baldur's Gate , that at the time belonged to the Athkatlan mage of dubious morals Lorroakan .</p>
