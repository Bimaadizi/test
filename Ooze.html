<p>An ooze was a category of creatures that generally resembled amorphous blobs and mostly dwelt underground. This category of creatures included slimes , jellies and puddings and amorphous creatures .</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Being a diverse array of creatures, oozes exhibited varying degrees of "sentience". While many were either completely lacking in intelligence or possessed a basic animal-level of intellect, some like the mustard jelly had intellects comparable to humans . The varying degrees of "ooze sentience" were a topic of heated debate amongst many Faer√ªnian scholars.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>They were essentially blind, but more than made up for that with an ability called blindsight , allowing them to discern nearby objects and creatures without needing to see them. Most oozes secreted an acid from their skin that dissolved flesh and other materials rapidly. They had a unique tendency to resist close-range and melee attacks by dissolving the wielder's weapon slowly.</p>
<h2>Varieties</h2>
<p>There were many types of oozes, the names often interchangeable with jellies and slimes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Demonomicon of Iggwilv was one of the sources that claimed that oozes originated as fragments of the offspring of Juiblex , who was the only known being capable of controlling oozes and of granting them a glimmer of intelligence and tactics.</p>
<p>Sometime in the late 1480s DR numerous oozes of various types were drawn to Blingdenstone under the auspices of the Pudding King .</p>
