<p>Kirina Aelorothi was an elven priest of Amaunator who worked as an adventurer in Cormyr during the late 15 th century DR . She was a member of the ancient elven House Aelorothi .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kirina had pale skin and bright red hair tied back in a ponytail. She wore a suit of armor emblazoned with Amaunator's symbols.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Kirina wasn't much of a fighter or leader, but was a skilled healer who worked best with allies.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the time of the Darkening , Kirina and her companions Jarus Brithandir , Popkin Shortshanks , Liantor Stoneborn , Helayna , and Tristran of Daggerford discovered a freshly-unearthed ancient tomb at the bottom of a crevasse in the Stonelands . They initially fought their way past some undead inhabitants, then discovered a secret passage leading deeper underground. After passing into a deeper cave system, the group was ambushed by a small army of Clan Daeronnax kobolds , who were able to overwhelm the group. The sneaky Popkin managed to escape to the surface and returned to Eveningstar to get help, but the rest of the party was lost in the caves.</p>
<p>Separated in the dark and unable to fight her way out, Kirina hid in a sheltered nook in the caves, hoping that she would be rescued before the kobolds found her. Fortunately, Popkin's help showed up on time and delivered a word of recall -infused trinket, sending Kirina back to Eveningstar immediately to reunite with her friends.</p>
