<p>Aleksei was a member of the Cult of the Crushing Wave in the Moonsea in 1491 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Aleksei was the rotten son of a minor noble. Having a bad life with his parents, in 1489 DR he left home and soon joined the water cultists. Aleksei acted as a pirate with fellow cultists until 1491 DR.</p>
<p>In that year, Aleksei's cell was ordered to attack Furgis Boltsmelter 's ship and take the elemental codex . However, an adventuring party hired by Furgis near Mulmaster as his bodyguards destroyed the cell and captured Aleksei.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Aleskei felt constantly oppressed in his home because his parents were completely ignorant to the troubles and tribulations of a teenager. In the Cult, his life was instead a flurry of worshiping, scuttling ships, and generally being a nuisance to local fisherman until recent times. Aleksei started to consider what it meant to be a cultist and was in search of an answer.</p>
