<p>Hanor Kichavo was an Tethyrian monk inhabiting Waterdeep during the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He favored yellow robes and kept his head cleanly shaved. Hanor smiled often, but the excitement of his beliefs often came through when he spoke.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Hanor was the leader, or Monastic Abbot, of the Order of the Sun Soul . One of his prime objectives was to unite the three sects both within the order and beyond—that is, the followers of Lathander , Selûne , and Sune . He taught from ancient texts that the three deities were tripartite fragments of Amaunator and that the Yellow God would rise again once all three were united. Hanor's "heretical" teachings made him many enemies within the churches of Lathander, Sune, and Selûne in Waterdeep. Some even believed that Hanor was an unwitting thrall of Shar designed to weaken the collective faiths of her enemies.</p>
