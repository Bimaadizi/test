<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1358 DR , a prisoner called Siulajia was captured by the Zhentarim and taken to meet with Geildarr Ithym . Cortarra, who was close to Lord Geildarr, became very jealous when she found out another woman was meeting with the lord. The frustrated mage chained Siulajia up, but did not kill her, keeping her locked up in her room instead.</p>
<p>Some time later, Cortarra wrote a letter to Lord Geildarr, claiming that Siulajia knew nothing of important events that concerned the Zhentarim . However, she was interrupted by the Heroes of Ascore , and at this point leaped upon her prisoner. After the struggle, both women stood to their feet, but appeared identical, the enchantress having transformed into Siulajia. They both claimed to be Siulajia in identical voices, but the heroes managed to tell them apart, and rescued the prisoner.</p>
<p>The enraged mage attacked the party with a contingent of Zhentarim soldiers and her cockatrices , but was slain.</p>
