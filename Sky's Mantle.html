<p>The Sky's Mantle was a prestigious tavern in the Stiltways of Yhaunn .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The tavern was located atop the fifth level of the Stiltways, on the southern side of the district.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Mantle was a quality tavern that catered to the wealthy socialites of Yhaunn. As it was built on the rooftop terraces of the district, patrons could enjoy a cool breeze and clear moonlight, a rarity in the crowded and built-up city.</p>
<p>Because the Stiltways were considered extremely dangerous at night, the Mantle appealed to those with a sense of daring, even though it was completely safe atop the fifth level. As such, it attracted a lot of young troublemakers from rich families, and the Mantle employed a team of bouncers to ensure any trouble they brought stayed outside.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1373 DR , the dissolute duelist Keph Thingoleir repeatedly encountered his rival Lyraene at the Mantle, and they instigated fights with each other.</p>
