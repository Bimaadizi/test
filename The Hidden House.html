<p>The Hidden House was a subterranean temple dedicated to Leira located beneath the city of Westgate in 1358 DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple was located in the northwest section of the city beneath the intersection of Wagonwheel Ride and Westgate Market Street . The temple's entrance was acessible my magic. A Leiran worshiper who wanted to visit the temple had to utter a specific prayer to the goddess in front of a statue near a nobleman's manse above the temple.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Those who entered The Hidden House of Leira using a prayer were transported to the temple's entryway – a chamber with no doors, but two balls of magical swirling water-like energy on both sides of a large statue of the masked goddess. Visitors were to touch the correct balls of magic and navigate a labyrinth of similar enclosed chambers to reach the temple's main halls. The temple was a collection of chambers and halls with tall ceilings held in place with carved columns and numerous statues of Leira integrated into the temple's architecture. The temple's main chamber of worship was a chapel with a fountain of the massive stone torso of the goddess.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , The Hidden House of Leira was lost and ruined. The temple's once sacred chambers were claimed by the scarlet oni mage called Skyrim . He and his ogre and orc henchmen laired in the ruins, and the oni mage used illusions to send images of ghostly Leiran priestesses to warn, scare, and intimidate unwanted visitors off. During that year, a charismatic thief Garrett the Bold uncovered a way to enter the hidden temple. He was joined by a group of adventurers as his muscle in order to loot the temple while Garrett himself searched for a famed Leiran artifact – the Cloak of Mysteries . The adventurers found a way to Skyrim and may have successfully liberated the ruin from its ogreish inhabitants, possibly claiming the artifact as their own.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The temple was run by High Mistmistress Halautha Immerstar . Halautha was assisted by 6 other priests and 4 followers.</p>
