<h2>History</h2>
<p>Warlord of Turmish, Sjorn Sendreth left his mark on the history of Faerûn by starting a war with the prosperous dwarven city of the Ironfang Deep in the Mountains of the Alaoreum . The assault on Ironfang took place in the Year of the Toppled Tree, 1220 DR , fueled by Sjorn Sendreth's greed and desire to claim Ironfang's stockpiles of gold and arms. The was eventually started exhausting Turmite coffers, forcing Sjorn Sendreth to send "treasure-parties" to search for gold to continue fueling the Turmish War of 1220. One of these expeditions would end up dooming the warlord. Sendreth's military campaign against the well-defense drawdown fortress lasted for the next twenty years until the Year of the Lost Lady, 1241 DR . Tired of injustice conflict, Ironfang elected to collapse a mountain onto the entrance into the subterranean city, effectively removing themselves from the conflict.</p>
<p>Ironfang did not achieve piece however. Shortly after the War of 1220, they entered the prolonged conflict with the duergar invaders. The following war became known as the Campaign of Darkness .</p>
<p>After Ironfang made itself inaccessible, in the Year of the Yellow Rose, 1242 DR , a group of treasurers returned to Alaghôn bearing booty stolen from a powerful blue dragon Anaglathos . The cunning wyrm decided to polymorph into a wolf companion of the treasurers' ranger guide and traveled with the band to Alaghôn. The group – the Company of the Sabred Tooth , were invited for an audience with the lord of Turmish, where Sjorn Sendreth was killed by the blue dragon. Anaglathos took the seat of power in Turmish, starting the period of history known as the Reign of the Wyrm .</p>
