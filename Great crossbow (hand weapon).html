<p>A great crossbow was an uncommon variant of crossbow that maximized damage and stopping power at the cost of being heavier and more difficult to use. It was one of the largest and most complex missile weapons a person could find outside of siege engines .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The great crossbow was larger and heavier than the heavy crossbow at up to 15 pounds (6.8 kilograms), still within the ability of a typical humanoid to carry and operate but requiring specialized training to use effectively. The string was typically pulled back via a winch mechanism, requiring an extended period to reload, and the weight was such that only extraordinarily large and strong creatures (such as ogres ) could even hold and shoot the weapon one-handed if needed.</p>
<p>The sheer power of these crossbows meant that they hit extremely hard and could stagger or knock down an unfortunate target with their impact, if they weren't slain outright. Great crossbow bolts maintained their accuracy and stopping power for longer than most crossbows, tending to drop off at around 120–150 feet (46–37 meters).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the reclamation of Myth Drannor in the 1370s DR , ancient magical great crossbows were among the treasures recovered from the ruins. These included intact golden age crossbows, wild magic -touched fallen age crossbows, and Thayvian -altered undying crossbows.</p>
