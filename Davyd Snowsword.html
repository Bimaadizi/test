<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Triton's Horn, 697 DR , a powerful and influential high priestess of Shar , Lalondra Worul , performed a ritual to become a lich . In the process, it killed all the high-ranking priests of the Sharran temples across the Sword Coast , leaving the common faithful suddenly leaderless. They began running riot in cities all across the Coast, threatening to overthrow several realms including Delimbiyran. When he attempted to quell their chaotic and destructive uprising with the strength of his soldiers, King Davyd was assassinated by a fanatical Sharran martyr, leaving the realm without a king or an heir to follow. Unable to agree on a successor, the lords and nobles of the realm split apart into their own independent petty kingdoms and states, including Loravatha , Scathril , Harpshield , Dauntylgar , Talmost , Calandor , Secomber , and more.</p>
