<p>Hethcypressarvil , usually known as Cypress , was the leader of a Cult of the Dragon cell in Elversult . He ended his mortal life when he was killed by Lady Yanseldara and he returned as a dracolich . His spirit resided in a giant topaz inset into a staff Yanseldara had inherited from her father. Obsessed with his "love" for Yanseldara, he arranged for the staff to be stolen, and kidnapped Lady Feng of the Shou to steal her spirit and bind them forever via a love potion.</p>
<p>Cypress was finally destroyed by the Bedine witch Ruha after Prince Tang shattered his phylactery in 1362 .</p>
