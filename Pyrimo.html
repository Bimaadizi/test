<p>Pyrimo were predatory fish similar to piranha that lived in the rivers and lakes of the Underdark .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Pyrimo were small, oval-shaped silver-scaled fish with powerful jaws filled with fangs that matched the width of its body. They were very aggressive and were known to jump out of the water to attack boat passengers or animals that approached the water too closely, whose wounds would then attract the attention of dozens of them. They were considered a tasty delicacy, although if not correctly prepared, they were highly toxic and inedible. While in the water, they were invisible to infravision , as their body temperature matched that of the water.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Pyrimo meat was commonly found for sale in the markets of Menzoberranzan .</p>
<h2>Hunting</h2>
<p>Pyrimo were often hunted by the drow , who would drop ensorcelled drops of roth√© blood in the water. The enchanted blood would not cool, and when the drop of blood suddenly disappeared, signaling that it had been swallowed, the fisher would thrust with a hunting spear . Fishers also carried flasks of liniment to massage their muscles, as the watchful tension and lightning spear thrusts caused a considerable strain.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR , Liriel Baenre , Bythnara Shobalar and Syzwick went to fish pyrimo on a boat. Liriel flirted with Syzwick, who was Bythnara's lover. Bythnara, terribly jealous, started massaging her neck muscles with a liniment, feigning physical strain from watching the water, but Liriel realized that in addition to massaging the wrong muscles, she was drawing the necessary patterns on her skin to cast a fireball spell at her. Liriel killed her with her hunting spear, and Bythnara fell in the water, where she was rapidly devoured by the pyrimo.</p>
