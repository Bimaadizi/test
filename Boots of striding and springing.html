<p>Boots of striding and springing were a pair of magical boots that allowed the wearer to potentially become faster, and jump further.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boots of striding and springing were blessed by Shaundakul as a part of their creation. There existed many varieties of these boots as each priest and crafter created fairly unique versions of these boots.</p>
<p>The wearer of some of the boots had their movement speed increased to 5 ft (1.5 m) per second, unless it was higher, in which case it did not change their speed.</p>
<p>Those who wore these boots would not feel burdened by carrying a large amount of weight, including heavy armor . As well as this, the wearer could jump triple their standard distance.</p>
<p>Some boots of striding did not affect the wearer's speed, but made the travel much easier and pleasant by improving wearer's constitution and making them more resilient.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1491 DR , Tharden Rockseeker , a dwarf explorer, wore such boots whilst camped in the Wave Echo Cave . He, however, was killed by Nezznar , and his brother was taken hostage.</p>
<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
<p>Garion Mendocio : an adventurer who grew up and honed his skills with blades in a traveling circus.</p>
