<p>Merrouroboros was a super-continent in existence on the planet Abeir-Toril during the Days of Thunder and before the Sundering of Abeir from Toril .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Merrouroboros was bordered on the west by the Silver Sea and on the south by the Great Blue .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The land of Merrouroboros was inhabited by the legendary creator races and the early jotunbrud and human tribes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the creation of the planet Abeir-Toril, that world had a great Ice Age, which ended in approximately −35,000 DR . At this time, the continent of Faerûn did not yet exist; instead, Faerûn was joined with Kara-Tur , Maztica , and Zakhara as part of Merrouroboros.</p>
<p>The sarrukh were the first to establish an empire on Merrouroboros, ruling over most of the land that would later be Faerûn. They were followed by the fey , who established the realm of Faerie around −34,000 DR . Third came the batrachi empires, coming to prominence some 500 years later and peaking around −31,500 DR . Lastly, the aearee empires emerged.</p>
<p>Merrouroboros ceased to exist around −17,600 DR in the great cataclysm known as the First Sundering , which caused the super-continent to break apart into Faerûn , Maztica , and Katashaka , and the appearance of Evermeet .</p>
