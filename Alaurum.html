<p>Alaurum was a powerful archmage of the world of Toril and one of three persons responsible for creating the World Serpent Inn , according to the wizard Elminster .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Very little is known about Alaurum—not even race or gender are known—except that the mage was friends with a member of the Arcane named Ilyndele . The two, together with the illithid High One Sharth , are said to have "crafted" the inter-planar inn.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hundreds of years before the late 14 th century DR , Alaurum, Ilyndele, and Sharth built the inn itself. The demiplane within which the inn resided—and the plane's many portals—had already existed, supposed by some cosmologists to be a dreamscape resulting from a sleeping fragment of the World Serpent .</p>
