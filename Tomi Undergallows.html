<p>Tomi Undergallows, or "Grin," as he was often known, was a male halfling rogue from the land of Calimshan . An escaped prisoner from the Neverwinter Peninusula District Prison , he was wanted for a number of crimes, including "deflowering" a pasha 's daughter and pickpocketing. Carefree and mischievous, Tomi rarely seemed to take things seriously.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Tomi owned the ring of the rogue a magical band that adjusted to its owner with time unlocking its full power. Tomi did not figure out how to use the ring thinking it useless. He later gifted the ring to the Hero of Neverwinter as a token of their friendship.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tomi Undergallows' trip to neverwinter began when he stole a silver goblet from a temple – the artifact known as the Silver Chalice of Moonbow . One of the temple's clerics, Linu La'neral , was tasked with the treasure's recovery as she was the one who let the hin thief into the temple in the first place, believing him to be a starving child. Subsequently, she found herself in the village of Llork and came across a mob that claimed Tomi Undergallows, was a vile murderer. Tomi was innocent was was only guilty of stealing the chalice and trying to sell it to a Zhent merchant for 500 gold coins . The merchant took the chalice in the name of Bane , the deity of tyranny, and Tomi was "taken care of" by the Zhentish mayor of the town. Linu was outraged by the injustice. She stormed straight into the crowd, but tripped and accidentally instigated a brawl. Serendipitously, that was exactly what Tomi needed to slip away from the accusers with the chalice in hand.</p>
<p>Linu continued her pursuit of the chalice and Tomi Undergallows and ended up in the city of Neverwinter in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Tomi briefly settled in the Peninsula District , but when the local prison was breached, slipping convicts into the district, the halfling moved to the City Core . There, Tomi, and, ironically, Linu La'neral, both became a part of the events that led to the end of the outbreak of the Wailing Death plague that ravaged the city. Along with several other heroes, Tomi was hired by Aribeth de Tylmarande , a paladin and a beloved hero, on behalf of Lord Nasher Alagondar , offering her adventuring prowess to the person who emerged to later be known as the Hero of Neverwinter. The Hero and Aribeth's adventurers became involved in the subsequent investigation and the Neverwinter- Luskan war.</p>
<p>According to Sharwyn , one of the Hero and Tomi's adventuring companions, the halfling, after his adventures in Neverwinter and Waterdeep , decided to stay in the City of Splendors and the city of Skullport underneath it.</p>
