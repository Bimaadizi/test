<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Empty Goblet, 1252 DR , the vine-blight ravished many grape orchards across large portions of Faerûn, depriving people that year of wine. In the Purple Hills, the either unaware or unsympathetic Duke of Ankramir and demanded the usual number of casks from the peasantry. The vintners and farmers refused to pay the levy and tried to sell their meager harvest in the North, where demand and prices where high, in an attempt to recoup some of their losses. The duke sent soldiers to confiscate the wine, only to see the casks broken and tossed into the Sea of Swords in what later became known as the Battle of the Broken Vats .</p>
<p>Around the 14 th century DR , Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue sold a variety of grape products. These included raisins from the lands of Berdusk, Saerloon, and Selgaunt for five gold pieces , one gold piece, and five silver pieces respectively. As well as brandied grapes from Imnescar, fruitcakes that contained raisins, spiced wines made with raisins, and winter wine.</p>
