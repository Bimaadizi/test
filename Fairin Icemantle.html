<p>Fairin Icemantle was a sage of the 6 th and 7 th centuries DR .</p>
<p>Fairin was the author of the Treatise Against Blood-Metal , in which he expressed his reservations about orcslayer blades whose steel was poisonous to orcs . He feared that they would lead to the development of other alloys toxic to many races, and spread death and destruction.</p>
<p>His treatise also discussed the dwarven attack on the orc kingdom of Vastar in the Year of the Spellfire, 610 DR , in which the dwarves wielded the new orcslayer blades. This provided the only first-hand account of the conflict to later generations. Fairin described the dwarven slaughter of the orcs, saying that they "run in waist-high riot across the land".</p>
