<p>Meo Cha was a noble of the Meo family of Xai Chung in Koryo in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>Meo Cha was the son of Meo Yungdo and brother of Meo Li .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Meo Cha studied at the Do Jang of Won Kwang , a prestigious military academy in the city of Pyong Do . There he was educated and trained in the arts of war and the history and lore of Koryo.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Meo Cha's father sent him to the Do Jang of Won Kwang at the age of 6.</p>
<p>Around 1350 DR , the king of Silla ordered Meo Cha (then aged 19) and Meo Li to be kidnapped and sold into slavery. His reason was unknown; it may have been for leverage against Yungdo, or in cruel revenge over some perceived offense. Meo Cha was visiting the city of Tu Pe when he was robbed and captured.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Meo Cha and Meo Li were reunited and managed to escape. They stowed away on a ship that, rather than being bound for Xai Chung as they'd thought, was in fact part of the king's own secret invasion fleet, now underway for Kozakura . But a tsunami wrecked the whole armada and the siblings were lost at sea.</p>
<p>Surviving the disaster, the Meo children were washed ashore, alive and well, in distant Shou Lung at Yu Tai Shuni . The dragon Mei Lung found them and allowed them to live in his house , where he gladly heard tales of their homeland. He later related their stories to Elminster .</p>
<p>Meo Cha and Meo Li eventually returned safely to Koryo, where the tyrant king had abdicated and their father became advisor to the new king, Wanang Sun .</p>
