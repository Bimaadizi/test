<p>Scourtop was the northernmost mountain in the Orcskull Mountains on the island of Moray in the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The granite peak of the mountain was encased in ice. Below the peak, the mountain's climate was dry (despite the occasional fog and rain) such that few insects or rodents lived there.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , there were no longer any human settlements near the mountain.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>In a high, bowl-shaped valley below the peak of Scourtop was an abandoned stone city so ancient that it was said to be the oldest evidence of civilization in the Moonshaes. This ruin contained a crypt that came to be Malar's tomb following the Spellplague .</p>
