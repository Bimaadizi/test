<p>Qualise Domo was a werewolf servant of Selûne , who was part of the New Moon Pact in the 8 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Qualise served Selûne as a werewolf of the New Moon Pact, fighting against the faith's enemies from the shadows. In 757 DR , the High Moonmistress Brima Chintamn of Bright Lady's Tower in Chancelgaunt declared the New Moon Pact a heresy, and Qualise was among those captured and executed.</p>
<p>When Feena Archwood investigated the mystery of the New Moon Pact in 1373 DR , Qualise's spirit appeared in her dreams alongside the other members of the Pact to defend and guide her. After she uncovered Velsinore 's heresy and they mutually slew each other, Feena's spirit was met by a Shard escort to the afterlife, but the spirits of the Pact members encouraged her to return to life and join the New Moon Pact herself. With the aid of Julith Harkspur 's healing, Feena was revived and ultimately continued the legacy of the Pact.</p>
