<p>Saldee was a sailor aboard the Vigilant circa 1374 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Saldee was a strong human woman with short-trimmed hair. She was aiming for a Captain's position and venerated both the Bitch Queen Umberlee and the Lady of Misfortune Beshaba . Saldee had a focused demeanor, strict personality, and she disliked jokes and levity.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Saldee was part of the Vigilant's crew in the 1374 DR when Captain Lastri Kassireh 's ship sailed from the Sword Coast to the nation of Samarach on the Chultan Peninsula . Onboard the ship were several passengers, including Volothamp Geddarm who traveled to meet with a wealthy yuan-ti merchant, Sa'Sani . The voyage was cursed with bad luck and numerous strange occurrences. Food supplies were mysteriously spoiled; freshwater barrels ruptured; one of the crew, a sailor, got drunk and drowned; Volo almost got poisoned as his poison soup took the life of Joquin ; and a fellow sailor Rienur noticed new ropes becoming strangely frayed.</p>
<p>The string of suspicious occurrences – yuan-ti sabotage, culminated in a deadly storm. The Vigilant's shipwreck was washed ashore not far from the city of Samargol . Most sailors perished in the storm, while others were captured to be devoured by the local cannibalistic Batiri goblins . Saldee was in a group of survivors of the crash that included Volo and a handful of passengers who had to defend themselves from hungry Batiri. Eventually, the survivors were placed under arrest by xenophobic Samarachan Elite Guard and taken to Samargol.</p>
