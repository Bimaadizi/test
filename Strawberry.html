<h2>Usage</h2>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid–14 th century DR , a farmer from Thunderstone named Del Geery used the dried skin of a hydra to make coverings for his raspberry , blueberry , and strawberry bushes. This covering kept the air around them at a cool 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius), extending their growing period deep into autumn. The hydra hides proved to be effective only on these three types of berry bush.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Nether Mountain Scrolls, 1486 DR , three Chosen of Silvanus got together on Sapra with the leaders of the Turmishan druidic order known as the Emerald Enclave and conducted a magical ritual that ended a famine that had been plaguing that nation. This caused all manner of food to instantaneously grow throughout the land, including strawberries.</p>
