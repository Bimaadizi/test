<p>Pigeon Rock Oasis was located in the Hordelands .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Located just west of the northern Quoya Desert , this small oasis got its name from the nearby outcropping of rock used to identify it. This rock was home to a great number of pigeons , who had carved a large number of nests into the rough surface over the years.</p>
<p>This oasis was seldom used. The lack of shade from the hot sun, the salty water, and the dry air from the desert, all made the oasis a poor stop, and prevented people from building any sort of business nearby.</p>
<h2>Rumors and Legends</h2>
<p>Killing the pigeons was considered bad luck.</p>
