<p>The Battlemaster's Arenas were a set of gladiatorial arenas in Wheloon Prison operated by Battlemaster Agarta of the Night Brigade gang.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Battlemaster Agarta used the arenas to train the Night Brigade warriors to a higher standard than common thugs. However, Agarta's true passion was in their use for gladiator fights. She pitted combatants against each other to earn money for the gang and to sate her own bloodlust, including volunteers, captives, and beasts like crocodiles and displacer beasts . She was even able to get contestants smuggled into the prison through bribery.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the Night Brigade assaulted the Riverside Rats gang, they took many of them captive. The unfortunate wererats were locked into magical collars that kept them from escaping, then forced to fight in the arenas. The scout Ryndalla Cuttail escaped before being trapped, and organized a counterattack on the hated foe. She got outside hires to head into the prison and meet Martildae , who gave them talismans that let them transform into rats . They used this shapeshifting to infiltrate the arenas, rescue the captive wererats, and took their place in a series of battles. They fought through a bout with a large captive crocodile, and then one with company of Storm Horns orcs including Bonegnasher the Cursed . Along the way they found the corpse disposal site where fallen contestants were dumped, and encountered the fallen Purple Dragon knight Ser Gregori the Broken , who had come back from the dead along with a horde of zombies . Having proven their skill, the invaders met the reigning champion, the cloud giant Durvastra , and fought him while Agarta watched from the stands. As the cloud giant faltered, Agarta's impatience got the better of her and she leapt into the arena herself. Despite her skill and ferocity she was unable to overcome the invaders and fell, leaving the Night Brigade without one of their best commanders.</p>
