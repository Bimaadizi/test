<p>The Chamber of the Court was a part of the Coronal's palace in Cormanthor .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The floor was glassy-smooth. Tapestries hung somewhere on the room. There were pillars in the room, which was large enough to hold a green dragon , and the ceiling, while closed, was the only source of magical light other then the Throne. The roof was vaulted. At least one person in 261 DR had brought a footstool. At least one of the tapestries had a window behind it.</p>
<p>Across from the doors was the Pool of Remembrance , above which floated the Throne of the Coronal . Above the roof, if broken, there was a statue of an elven hero with a sword pointed at the throne.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>There were wards, that would, amongst other things, prevent a dragon from being summoned.</p>
<p>Courtiers usually remained at both sides of the room, while armathors stood watch by the door.</p>
