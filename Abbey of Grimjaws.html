<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This structure was located in northeastern Impiltur , on the western shore of Bluefang Water .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In his declining years Jonhar Tallmane , a paladin and knight who served under the Impilturan kings Nord and Halanter II , retired to the Abbey of Grimjaws. There he gave up the enchanted blade Ellendrin , a gift bestowed upon him by Helenter II, and declared that ownership would fall to a different paladin of the Abbey each year. Jondar's stipulation was that said paladin had to wield Elendrin in defense of the Impilturan monarchy. This tradition would continue until the final days of Old Impiltur .</p>
