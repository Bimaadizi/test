<p>Flask Circle was a small shopping district in the Anvil neighborhood of Ravens Bluff , referred to by some as a "boutique district." It was originally a hidden cul-de-sac, but by late 1370 DR it had opened up and gained direct ingresses from two streets.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Paved in cobblestone, this cul-de-sac was located roughly within the Crow's End district's Anvil neighborhood, behind a block of shops formed by the cross-section of Black Visor Street , Blacktree Boulevard South , De Viliar's Ride , and Red Wyrm Ride . Each of these shops were intersectionally linked by brick walls, enclosing the market. The cul-de-sac was entered through a narrow alleyway, accessible only through a door in Flora's Flower Shop that was concealed behind a curtain. In order to enter the market, one had to wear some form of a flower on their person, otherwise, they would be recognized as having snuck in.</p>
<p>By 1370 DR, the cul-de-sac housing Flask Circle was opened up into a proper alleyway, with ingresses from Blacktree Boulevard South and Red Wyrm Ride.</p>
