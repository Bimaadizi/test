<p>A decanter of endless water was a magical flask that could produce streams of water of different intensities.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A typical decanter of endless water looked like an ordinary stoppered flask that produced a sound of sloshing water when shaken.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A user activated the decanter by unstoppering the flask and speaking a command word. There were three possible commands that a decanter of endless water accepted, each producing a different amount of fresh or salt water, depending on the user's choice. The command "stream" created 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water; the command "fountain" generated 5 gallons (19 liters); and the command "geyser" created a violent jet of 30 gallons (110 liters) of water that gushed out to a range of 30 feet (9.1 meters), damaging and pushing back creatures and objects in the process, which lasted only for a few seconds.</p>
<p>Some versions of the decanter produced a continuous flow that could only be stopped by the user speaking the command word again.</p>
<h2>Notable Decanters of Endless Water</h2>
<p>A fountain located in the Shadowdusk Hold level of Undermountain was fueled by a decanter of endless water located within a statue of an aboleth .</p>
<p>The private bath of the high priestess of the House of the Moon temple in Waterdeep , Naneatha Suaril , had water continuously supplied by a decanter of endless water built into the base of the pool. A secondary enchantment on the decanter allowed the water to be changed anywhere from freezing to boiling at but a touch.</p>
