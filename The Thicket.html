<p>The Thicket was a grove lying somewhere deep in the High Forest . It was the lair of followers of Malar , many of them lycanthropes , known as "the children of the Thicket".</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the autumn of Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the children of the Thicket attacked the city of Loudwater after a blood-red moon appeared in the sky. For three bloody nights , they raided the city and homesteads, forced people out of their houses, and engaged in frenzied hunting and slaughter, before finally slaying the then Green Regent , Galaer Grasswave . After that, they melted back into the woods.</p>
