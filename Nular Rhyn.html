<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Though he was on the smaller side, Nular possessed an intimidating appearance. His muscular physique was decorated with the same traditional Thayan tattoos that adorned his entire face.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Born to a noble family within Thay, Nular displayed no aptitude for magic in his youth. He was, however, rather skilled with the sword.
