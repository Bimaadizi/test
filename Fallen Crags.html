<p>The Fallen Crags was an area of wild and dangerous rough rocky terrain and crags located at the heart of Icewind Dale .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Fallen Crags was the area that laid east of Maer Dualdon , southeast from Kelvin's Cairn , and northeast from Bryn Shander , placing it in the way of any caravans that moved from the Dwarven Valley to any of the Ten-Towns. The land of the Fallen Crags was littered with rocks, crevices, crags, and snowed-over canyons formed by tricking springs. Various species of local wildlife made traversing the Fallen Crags a challenge and the constant frigid fog that obscured the view across the Crags, made it a prime site for ambushes. Local bests, such as wolves , polar bears , and verbeegs, as well as snow goblins , were the primary danger for human and dwarvish traders alike. However, human bandits and ruffians were also known to camp in the area.</p>
<p>The Deep Rift , a canyon infested with snow spiders laid directly east of the Fallen Crags.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Mirtul of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , as the Ten Towns and the Dwarven Valley were facing looming ancient evil. On her way to Targos , crossing the Fallen Crags, Baldryn Irontooth , a trader of Clan Firehammer , met "black-hearted swine and thieving scoundrels". She thought the group of humans not to be a danger, but she was wrong. The bandits quickly turned on her, surrounded, and made off with her mule and the shipment. Baldryn managed to escape unscathed and made it to Targos. The dwarf hoped to report the mugging and gather Targos militia to track the villains down, but ended up trapped in the city going into a lockdown – the result of an influx of refugees from the other Ten-Towns. Soon after, she met the Hero of Neverwinter , who sought to do business with Graendel Granitefist. Baldryn offered a generous reward for ending the brigands and returning the stolen cargo.</p>
