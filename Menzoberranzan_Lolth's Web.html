<p>Lolth's Web was a neighborhood of the district of West Wall in Menzoberranzan that was suspended from the ceiling and walls by calcified spider silk.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lolth's Web was located in West Wall next to the district of Narbondellyn . It consisted of hundreds of strands of calcified spider silk stretching from the ceiling to the ground in a dense latticework. Hollow, cocoon-like structures, both on top of and below the webs, provided living space. Narrow ladders connected the levels for those without the ability to levitate .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lolth's Web was constructed by survivors of the destruction of Ched Nasad , which fell in 1372 DR . Over the next hundred years, the survivors based Lolth's Web on the structure of their home city, using magical techniques to weave the web.</p>
