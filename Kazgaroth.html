<p>Kazgaroth , also spelled Kazgoroth and known as the Beast and the Darkwalker , was a quasi-power believed to be an aspect of Bhaal . He was a powerful, intelligent, evil beast opposed to the balance and the influence of the Earthmother on the Moonshae Isles . It would periodically ravage the land until it was defeated, only to return several years later.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kazgaroth's natural form was that of a massive " tyrannosaurus " with acidic saliva, but it could shape-change to other forms, including those of people whom it killed and devoured before impersonating.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first known appearance of Kazgaroth was circa −2000 DR when the children of the Earthmother, the Llewyrr elves , and the dwarves of Moonshae united to stop its rampage. The conflict lasted for decades until Kazgaroth and its firbolg and fomorian minions were driven back. Although victorious, this led to the decline and ultimate retreat of the realm of Sarifal into the Feywild</p>
<p>Kazgaroth returned to the Isles in the Year of the Student, 201 DR , but was defeated by Cymrych Hugh , who would become known as a legendary hero and the first High King of the Ffolk thanks to his triumph over the Beast.</p>
<p>By the 14 th century DR , he was revered by a Beast Cult . Kazgoroth was reborn from the Darkwell , a moonwell corrupted by Bhaal, in the Year of the Saddle, 1345 DR . It drew power from that moonwell, which was also a place where Bhaal's avatar entered the Realms.</p>
<p>Afterward, Kazgaroth took several guises. The first few were a cow , which attracted a bit too much attention, and a woman named Meridith , who drew too much attention because Kazgaroth used its powers to make her body more attractive. The Beast's first victim was a man named Erian who was a guard for the prince Tristan Kendrick of the Moonshaes , whom Kazgoroth transformed into a werewolf to subvert one of the Earthmother 's defenses, the Pack . Afterwards, he changed into a dryad in order to lure the druid Trahern of Oakvale . His next victim was Thelgaar Ironhand , king of Oman , of whom he took the identity so he could command the army of Northmen in their attack on the southern Moonshae Isles, mainly the city of Caer Corwell . Kazgoroth was finally forced to retreat back to the Darkwell , where it was slain by Prince Tristan Kendrick and his companions, though its heart was recovered by Trahern.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Some claimed that Kazgoroth had created the firbolgs of the Moonshae Isles.</p>
