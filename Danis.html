<p>Danis was a tiefling from Elturel who along with his mate Bex and others of their kind, were kicked out of Elturel following the cataclysmic event known as the Descent .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was man of good spirits who maintained a positive outlook on life, especially when focused on his future with his beloved Bex. The two dreamed of starting a new life together in Baldur's Gate , getting a nice little house and starting an eatery in the Outer City .</p>
<h2>Ability</h2>
<p>Danis brewed a mean pot of spiced tea , that according to Bex, was "life-changing".</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the tieflings of Elturel were exiled in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Danis and Bex joined the group led by the former Hellrider Zevlor and traveled west along the Risen Road . Unfortunately the community of tieflings were beset by goblin attacks and forced to request aid from the druid Halsin and his fellows at the Emerald Grove . While the couple and their fellow tieflings were safe with temporary shelter, tensions grew between them and the druids after Halsin went missing and Kagha took over temporary leadership.</p>
<p>These dynamics did little to deter Danis or Bex, who remained blissfully focused on one another and their shared dreams for a new life in a new city.</p>
