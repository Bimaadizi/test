<p>Morizuku was a hunting spider katanga who served the Mother of a Thousand Young as her bodyguard within the Fire Mountain of the Malatran Plateau in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As an experienced warrior, Morizuku was a fearsome foe. He preferred to fight in bipedal form while starting combat by throwing ranged weapons at the enemy.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Morizuku was armed with a large enchanted wooden shield and carried five halfspears into battle. Like other spider katanga, Morizuku could freely crawl across any surface, and his bite was a deadly venomous weapon.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR , the Wise Ones tribe became aware of the leader of evil spider katanga , the Mother of a Thousand Young, being ready to birth a thousand ravenous younglings. In preparation for the birthing, she initiated a ritual that sent deadly poisons into the rivers cascading off the Fire Mountain. Morizuku, along with Taluku , was tasked with guarding the venomous Mother at the center of her bones-riddled nest. Both katanga fought defensively when a band of heroes from the Living Jungles reached the Mother of a Thousand Young in an attempt to end the poisoning and the spawning.</p>
<p>Morizuku's fate is unknown; however, his death was almost unavoidable as he and Taluku would fight until their dying breath to defend the Mother.</p>
