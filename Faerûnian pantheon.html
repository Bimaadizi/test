<p>The Faerûnian pantheon was the most worshiped pantheon on Faerûn , a continent on Toril .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<h3>Membership</h3>
<p>The Faerûnian pantheon was a pantheon of deities . Pantheons were a group of deities who were worshiped by people who shared one characteristic, for example sharing the same cultural or racial background. In the Faerûnian pantheon's case the believers' shared characteristic was a geographic one, people who lived in those parts of the continent Faerûn where other pantheons did not hold sway were the believers.</p>
<h3>Hierarchy</h3>
<p>The Circle of Greater Powers were the twelve deities that led the pantheon. The leadership was a loose matter and was more of administrative nature. Apart from this, there was little hierarchy in the Faerûnian pantheon except for the one the gods created among themselves. A unique trait of the Faerûnian pantheon was that deities with similar portfolios clustered in a hierarchic relationship. The reason they did this, or to be more precise the reason why the highest deity did not just kill the lower-ranking ones and assumed their places, was surmised to be either a bargain where the lower-ranking deity helped the higher-ranking one at increasing its influence in return of protection, or blackmail where the higher-ranking one bullied the lower-ranking ones into giving them their divine energy and servitude. It was assumed that the exact nature of such arrangements varied with the personalities of the involved deities.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Faerûnian pantheon was a very fractious one that fought among themselves and had no overarching goal. This fractious nature was believed to be the source of the pantheon's adaptability and its ability to expand. When it expanded its physical sphere of influence, it usually did so at the expense of other pantheons.</p>
<p>The aforementioned Circle of Greater Powers regulated the deities according to the rules as set by Ao , the overgod of Toril to whom all pantheons worshiped on Toril were subject to. However, the leaders rarely (if ever) convened to carry out their duties. On the occasions where they did convene they were slow to act, not because of deliberation but because of conflict between each other.</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, the Faerûnian pantheon was a single-sphere pantheon. The reason why gods deliberately concentrated their work on one single world at the exclusion of others was that this way they could shut out deities from other worlds entering and infringing on their home turf.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Faerûnian pantheon had―as it was normal for single-sphere pantheons―no base of operations. The members held their divine realms where it suited them most. The closest to a base of operations was the pavilion of Cynosure , a demiplane where the Circle of the Greater Powers met.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, the Faerûnian pantheon was subject to Ao and tried to execute his rule of Balance.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, single-sphere pantheons were good at defending themselves from infringement from potential external rivals. This came at the cost of interplanar unimportance, Toril's deities were, as deities who were worshiped only on a backwater plane like Toril, unimportant deities on the interplanar political landscape. However, the rate at which their importance grew was equal to that of the most vibrant of pantheons. That said, the Faerûnian pantheon ever becoming an important force on the interplanar landscape was considered unlikely at best.</p>
<p>The Faerûnian pantheon as a whole had special relationships with the Chultan pantheon . The pact between the two was quite simple, Ubtao would look out for Dendar while the Faerûnian pantheon would leave Ubtao's turf alone for this service.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Faerûnian pantheon was created out of the merging of at least four pantheons, the Coramshite pantheon , the Jhaamdathan pantheon , the Netherese pantheon , and the Talfiric pantheon . These pantheons were all geographically divided human pantheons. In ancient times, human pantheons were loosely geographically divided because the humans' population density and area was such that they did not border each other. Over time, the human cultures and borders intermingled with each other and their pantheons intermingled too. When this happened, deities of similar portfolios had to fight each other for supremacy to get rid of the other one. Over time, the pantheons merged together and the Faerûnian pantheon was born. For example, Garagos and Tempus , both war gods of the Netherese and Talfiric pantheon respectively, fought each other and the former lost. It was not clear when exactly the various pantheons merged into the Faerûnian pantheon. Various gods entered and dropped out of the pantheon.</p>
<p>For example, Jergal split his portfolio among three mortals, Bane , the new god of strife, Bhaal , the new god of murder, and Myrkul , the new god of death, the last whom Jergal served. Other mortals who arose to godhood were Azuth , who needed to fight over his position with Savras , Gwaeron Windstrom , the Red Knight , Torm , and Uthgar .</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Farûnian pantheon was a single-sphere pantheon. Gods formed such with the objective of shutting out other world's deities from Toril. That said, various deities managed to sneak into the pantheon of Toril and the number of such deities was expected to increase. That world was a favored destination of foreign deities who were losing influence for one or the other reason. Examples included Oghma and Silvanus from the Celtic pantheon, Tyr from the Norse pantheon , and Loviatar and Mielikki from the Finnish pantheon, all entering the Faerûnian pantheon to cling to life and/or some degree of influence. Another example was Tyche from the Greek pantheon who split in two deities Beshaba and Tymora over the course of the Dawn Cataclysm .</p>
<h3>Era of Upheaval</h3>
<p>The gods, not only of the Faerûnian pantheon but all of them, were cruel creatures who exploited mortals while not pursuing their duties on levels that horrified Ao, who was losing his patience with them because of it. The last straw was the theft of the Tablets of Fate at the hand of Bane and Myrkul, two deities of the Faerûnian pantheon. The Time of Troubles was started by Ao as a response. During that time, Toril's deities had to possess mortals or walk in avatar form on the world.</p>
<p>During that time, a deity's avatar's death could mean the death of the deity. Among the deities who died were Bane, Bhaal, Myrkul, Mystra , and Torm, the last one was reinstalled, the first three's positions were overtaken by Cyric , and Mystra's was overtaken by Midnight . Other deities who arose over the course of the Time of Troubles were Iyachtu Xvim and Finder Wyvernspur by killing an avatar of Moander . Shar killed two deities, Ibrandul and Eshowdow . The latter had potential to become important for the Shadow Giant was a member of the Chultan pantheon and Shar making inroads into that pantheon was an action that did potential harm to the agreement between the Faerûnian pantheon and the Chultan one.</p>
<p>A pantheon that stopped working as one because of the Time of Troubles was the Untheric pantheon . Its surviving members, Hoar and Tiamat , signed up with the Faerûnian one. The end of the Untheric pantheon had another effect too, for Unther 's territory was up for the taking by either the Faerûnian or Mulhorandi pantheon . Both pantheons' stance regarding the matter could be summed up as "stand by and watch", but the smaller Mulhorandi one feared to be swallowed up by the bigger one.</p>
<p>Another presumed effect of the Avatar Crisis was that the gods of the Faerûnian pantheon started to look out for other sources of faith outside of Toril to become more powerful.</p>
<p>The troublesome time for the Faerûnian pantheon did not end with the Time of Troubles. Cyric tried to increase his power. He killed Leira for that goal and ordered the writing of the Cyrinishad , a book that made the reader believe that Cyric was the greatest person in existence, and completed it. He read it himself and fell into delusional hubris. In the wake of his madness, he lost the portfolio of death to Kelemvor and that of tyranny to Iyachtu Xvim. Cyric later came back to his senses in 1371 DR .</p>
<p>In 1368 DR , Velsharoon became a deity. In 1372 DR , Bane returned by killing his son Xvim.</p>
<p>In 1374 DR , Daelegoth Orndeir cast Amaunator's eternal sun and with it heralded the transformation of Lathander to Amaunator . In the same year, Mask handed his power and life over to Shar .</p>
<p>In 1384 DR , Tyr killed Helm over the misunderstanding that the latter wanted an adulterous relationship with his wife Tymora . In 1385 DR , Tyr abdicated and died fighting a demon horde.</p>
<p>In 1385 DR , Cyric murdered Mystra and with it the Spellplague happened. On the divine side, Savras died with Dweomerheart , Azuth fell into the Nine Hells and was eaten by Asmodeus who then became a deity. Deneir built himself and the Metatext into the Weave or what remained of it and ceased to exist.</p>
<p>After the Spellplague, various formerly racial deities made inroads into the Faerûnian pantheon and various racial deities turned out to be Faerûnian deities' aspects and vice versa.</p>
<p>Examples of gods who had aspects in the form of racial deities were Aerdrie Faenya , who turned out to be Akadi , or Hanali Celanil , who turned out to be Sune . A reverse example was Talos who turned out to be Gruumsh , the orcish head deity.</p>
<p>Members of racial pantheons who made inroads into the Faerûnian one were Corellon , Ghaunadaur , Gruumsh, Lolth , and Moradin .</p>
<p>Lolth tried to become the deity of magic in 1480 DR . She failed and Mystra returned to power.</p>
<h3>Second Sundering</h3>
<p>In the wake of the Second Sundering , a number of deities made their return. Drasek Riven put on the mantle of Mask. The formerly racial deities left the Faerûnian pantheon for their racial ones.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<h3>Members after the Second Sundering</h3>
<p>The following were members of the Faerûnian pantheon after the Second Sundering:</p>
<h3>Former Members</h3>
<p>The numerous former members could be broadly divided into two categories: Faerûnian deities who vanished in the wake of the Spellplague and Second Sundering, or racial deities of other pantheons that were briefly counted as part of the Faerûnian pantheon in the interim time between those two events.</p>
