<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Jarra had pale skin, tied-back blonde hair, and wore a suit of leather armor while carrying a longbow as tall as she was.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the aftermath of the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar , Jarra was distressed to find that hostile blights were emerging from the nearby Mielikki's Grove . While it was obvious to suspect the local hag Granny Gertrude , Jarra couldn't say for sure that the hag was guilty, and so sent adventurers to investigate the matter and discern what was really going on.</p>
