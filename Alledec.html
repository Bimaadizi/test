<p>Alledec was a life-long priest from a religious order dedicated to Ilmater , who lived in the 9 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Alledec had been a devotee of Ilmater for twenty years before he decided to leave a legacy after his time on Toril was over. He began working on the enchanted weapon called Three White Doves - a masterfully crafted mace weapon of black-enameled steel and a handle of ivory . The weapon was completed in the Year of the Empty Throne, 850 DR , and Alledec died peacefully in his sleep in the Year of the Hungry Box, 853 DR . After the cleric's death, the Three White Doves was entrusted to an Ilmatiri fighter , and after that, to the traveling cleric – Recken the Bold , who lost it in a struggle against a powerful vampire near the Trollbark Forest .</p>
