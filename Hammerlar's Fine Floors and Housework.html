<p>Hammerlar's Fine Floors and Housework was the woodshop of Olen Hammerlar , the highly skilled house carpenter found within the city of Sundabar during the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<p>He would work throughout the Sundabar Vale , taking his wagon -drawn, horse -driven sawmill anywhere within a six-day ride from the city.</p>
<p>Hammerlar prided himself on fast, efficient work in and around the city of Sundabar. Unless ordered during the winter months, Olen swore he only needed a single day to build the porch of a house, or a tenday for a palisade or entire cabin.</p>
