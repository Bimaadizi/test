<p>The Thayan outpost in Evernight , also known as Evernight's Thayan Enclave , was a base from which agents of Thay were able to make their presence felt within that city. The outpost also overlooked and maintained a shadow crossing from which Thayan agents could arrive in the Shadowfell from Neverwinter 's Neverdeath graveyard on the Material Plane .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It was located south of the river of lava that flowed through Evernight and was not far from the Haunted Pier and the Deaders Market . It was within sight of the small hill on which the portal from Neverdeath was located.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The outpost was located within a warehouse that was blackened from fire damage.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The outpost served as a headquarters for Thayan interests in Evernight, particularly in managing the portal, overseeing traffic along the Shadowfell Road (and paying the city for the privilege of using it, generally in the form of living victims for the undead citizen to consume ), and keeping an eye on things in the Shadowfell. In particular, the outpost attempted to identify spies working for Netheril , such as those operating out of the dark creeper enclave . However, the undead Tribunal of Evernight forbade Thay and Netheril from open warfare, and so the Thayans had to settle for nothing more overt than assassinations and the occasional ambush. As the Thayan's largely benefitted from the status quo, they did not feel the need to test the city's patience with them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This outpost was not the Thayans' primary headquarters in the Sword Coast North at the time of its operation. Thayan machinations in the area were led by Valindra Shadowmantle , who also maintained larger bases in the Neverneath and at the Dread Ring in Neverwinter Wood .</p>
<h2>Notable Inhabitants</h2>
