<p>The Sorrow's Tear was a unique ghostly dagger created out of a ghost's tear by Elytharra Dinnesmore of Targos in the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This dagger was a weightless ethereal silver blade. The weapon's magic came from the ghostly's tear and the feelings of sorrow and relief that it contained. When the blade landed a stab, it had a chance of transferring the ghost's suffering anguish onto the target. The weapon possessed a +2 enchantment that was especially deadly to incorporeal undead creatures.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , the goblin slayers of Targos may have aided Cahl-Hyred , the innkeeper of the Weeping Widow Inn , to aid the establishment's namesake. The weeping ghost was the widow Veira who waited for her husband, who perished in Maer Dualdon in years past. When she was shown a piece of Veira's Gaze , the ghost gifted adventurers a single ghostly tear as a thank you. Later, enchantress Elytharra Dinnesmore offered to use the tear's magic and shape it into a magical spectral blade.</p>
