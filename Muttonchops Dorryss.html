The crisis flooded the city with refugees, elevating tensions among its citizens and allowing a new power to take rulership of the city â€“ Lord Gortash . Muttonchops Dorryss eagerly consumed the new lord's propaganda from the curbside preachers and from the pages of the Baldur's Mouth Gazette. Augur Harxkellan was a Gortash loyalist whose words attracted a crowd of gawkers in the Lower City. Muttonchops Dorryss was among the loyalist crowd, calling the new lord "Lightbringer Gortash."</p>
