<p>Xai Chung was a settlement in the kingdom of Koryo in Kara-Tur around 1357 DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It lay on the western side of Kang Bay near the foot of the Vorkani Mountains , which one could view from a balcony in Xai Chung.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Xai Chung was governed by Meo Yungdo , who was also the advisor to King Wanang Sun . [ speculation ]</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was a rather sedate place, compared to Tu Pe , at least. One road there was Lu Chan Street.</p>
<p>The ancestral mansion of the Meo family stood in Xai Chung.</p>
<p>The Nikanii bazaar was a market in Xai Chung. On display here in the midâ€“14th century DR was the skeleton of one of the birdmen of the Vorkani Mountains; a Koryoan adventurer discovered the bones in the nest of a giant spider he had slain.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The bodies of three members of Koryo's "night brotherhoods" were once found in Lu Chan Street circa 1347 DR , apparently having slain each other for dark secrets.</p>
<p>Around 1350 DR , the king of Silla ordered "nameless ones" of one of these brotherhoods to kidnap Meo Li , the teenage daughter of Meo Yungdo . They swung down from the rooftops, used magic sleep powder on her, and whisked her away from her guards.</p>
