<p>Elaacrimalicros , also known as Elaar , was a green dragon who made his home among the Star Mounts in the High Forest . He was thought to be by far the oldest dragon living in the High Forest as of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was rapacious, cruel, and delighted in killing. He was also very private, and thus very dilligent in protecting his territory.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Elaacrimalicros spent much of his time asleep, only awakening once every few decades. When he did, he seemed to take care to eliminate any who attempted to scale the Star Mounts, and would engage in flyby attacks to fling climbers off the mountainsides.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Because he destroyed their homes, the aarakocra who once dwelt on the Star Mounts—along with their descendants—all swore revenge on Elaacrimalicros. One group in particular, a cabal of ten wizards , clerics , and druids known as the Nest of Retribution , was amassing an army of air elementals at the Lost Peaks in preparation to attack the dragon as of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 1360s DR, Elaacrimalicros was awoken, although it was not clear at the time what had awakened him. He immediately set about savaging the five local settlements of aarakocra who had come to dwell on the Star Mounts, consuming over 120 of them and scattering the rest across the North and as far south as Cormyr . Only a few survivors remained in the Star Mounts, coming together at the head of the Unicorn Run in a new village known as the Last Aerie .</p>
<p>In the following years, he continued to haunt the Star Mounts, and it was rumored that he was protecting a great treasure.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, the descendants of the aarakocra driven from the Star Mounts continued to plot and quest to kill Elaacrimalicros.</p>
