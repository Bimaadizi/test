<h2>History</h2>
<p>Selfaril was unable to risk keeping Rassendyll within the city, yet could not bring it upon himself to kill his brother. Instead he "promoted" the lesser son to the role of an ambassador to the city of Waterdeep , while in reality, the appointment was more of an exile.</p>
<p>In 1368 DR , Rassendyll seized power by removing his brother from office and replacing him. The removal of Selfaril had been devised by Fzoul Chembryl in a bid to gain control over Mulmaster. The story wen that Rassendyll was in "exile" at this time, assigned to a diplomatic post in Waterdeep . Selfaril's soul was trapped in a gem in the hilt of his sword.</p>
