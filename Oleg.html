<p>Oleg was a half-orc smith in Daggerford around 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Oleg was a very able weaponsmith but few in the town trusted a half-orc enough to enter his shop. Mostly, people threw garbage against his windows. Despite this, Oleg was the most patient and calm individual in Daggerford.</p>
