<p>Queen Yenandra ruled Dambrath for 81 years and just began to show signs of age in her last decade. Sometime during this period, she contracted a disease or finally succumbed to one that confounded the clerics, and when it became clear that her days were numbered she voluntarily underwent the process of becoming a spectral guardian . Her daughter Hasafir performed the ritual along with several other drow sorcerers and then Hasafir assumed the throne in 1356 DR .</p>
