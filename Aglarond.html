<p>Aglarond ( pronounced : /ˈ ɑː g l ɑː r ɒn d / AHG-lah-rond ) was a magocratic state in the southwestern-most part of the Unapproachable East with its capital at Veltalar . Most of its land was covered by the Yuirwood . Filled with magic and mystery, it was ruled by one of the most potent spellcasters of the Realms: the Simbul , until 1425 DR , and around 1479 DR , it was ruled by fifteen Simbarchs , arcane spellcasters trained in the Simbul's arts.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>There was only one major port in Aglarond, Velprintalar , later known as Veltalar . The large peninsula's coastline mainly comprised rocky cliffs with villages and towns settled near inlets suitable only for fishing boats and other smaller ships.</p>
<p>As of 1479 DR, the Yuirwood was filled with plaguelands formed in the wake of the Spellplague , filled with ruins of an ancient, long-gone eladrin civilization.</p>
<h3>Regions</h3>
<h3>Towns and Cities</h3>
<p>The larger cities in Aglarond were the coastal ones. Most cities were supported by agriculture or fishing. Wealthier inhabitants lived in stone buildings, the poor lived in thatched huts, and those in-between lived in buildings of two or three stories, made of weathered wood with steep shale or tile roofs. Construction was usually dense, with narrow streets.</p>
<h3>Other Geographical Features</h3>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Aglarond was formed after the Battle of Ingdal's Arm in the Year of the Watching Wood, 1065 DR , when the half-elves , who were victorious in the battle, negotiated for the creation of a new nation, with Brindor Olósynne , who had led the half-elf army, as its first king.</p>
<p>The Olósynne Dynasty remained in power until the apparent death of the Simbul in battle with the god Velsharoon in the Year of Seven Sisters, 1425 DR .</p>
<p>As of 1479 DR , the Simbarch Council had recently taken control of the country.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Aglarond was ruled for several centuries starting in 1065 DR by the Olósynne Dynasty , beginning with the half-elf King Brindor and ending with the apparent death of Alassra Shentrara , "the Simbul," in 1425 DR. Under this system of government, the monarch was advised by a council of thirty, made up of eleven councilors from major cities and a further nineteen from smaller settlements. Every community in Aglarond was entitled to elect a member to the council, although the Fanger cities of Dahst and Findar did not acknowledge that they are part of Aglarond and never sent a councilor.</p>
<p>After the Simbul's disappearance and the end of the monarchy, Aglarond was ruled over by the Simbarch Council , an assembly of fifteen mages learned in the ways of the Simbul. Following her end, the Simbul's followers banded together and took control of the Palace of the Simbul , from which they governed as of 1479 DR, and took it upon themselves to lead her former kingdom. Their rule was not unchallenged, however, and the Council eventually resorted to military might to bring rebelling regions to heel. Since coming to power, the Simbarch Council consolidated their rule and extended Aglarond's power over the disputed Wizard's Reach , defeating the armies of Thay 's exiled zulkirs for control of the region.</p>
<h2>Military</h2>
<p>Aglarond's army was formed by Brindor Olósynne early in the nation's history. The army was small and skilled as of 1368 DR , famed for its Foresters —elite units of rangers loyal to the crown—operating in the Yuirwood . The rest of the army comprised archers , pikemen , and a few cavalry. These were garrisoned at the fortress of Emmech (later renamed Undumor) and the citadel Glarondar . Glarondar also featured a small number of griffon -riders used for scouting. During this period, the militia numbered around 6,000.</p>
<p>Aglarond also has a strong tradition of local militias. When the size of the army was insufficient to deal with a threat, everyday people in Aglarond took up arms, using spears and pikes. The 6,000 trained troops could easily be joined by four times that number of citizens.</p>
<p>Aglarond did not formally have a navy. The Foresters used boats called coastboats for transportation and raids, especially against invading forces.</p>
<p>In the late 1400s DR, the military of Aglarond was used to cement the control of the Simbarch Council, first through the suppression of resistance to the new government in outlying regions of the country and later as a defense against the encroaching threat of Thay.</p>
<h2>Demographics</h2>
<p>As of 1372 DR, Aglarond's population, numbering somewhere around 1,270,080, was mostly made up of humans , though one-third were half-elves and a fair number elves . Over the course of the century since, the local tiefling population swelled, due to the large number of refugees fleeing from Thay , particularly in the cities of Escalant , Glarondar , and Citadel Dantalien . Many dragonborn also came to Aglarond from neighboring lands and both genasi and halflings were found in large numbers in Delthuntle , Veltalar , and Furthinghome .</p>
<h3>Humans</h3>
<p>The humans of Aglarond are regarded as trustworthy and hardworking, living simple lives from agriculture, fishing and herding livestock. Traditionally humans kept close to Aglarond's coastal cities, since these were the first founded by them in the 750s DR, when human colonists first arrived.</p>
<p>Originally, human colonists arriving in Aglarond were Untherites from Chessenta , but these were soon joined by settlers and adventurers from other parts of Faerûn . The average height of an Aglarondan female was 5 foot 2 inches (157 centimeters) and a male 5 foot 8 inches (173 centimeters). They were hardy, tough people with blue or brown eyes.</p>
<p>Eastern Aglarondan humans dressed in bright colored tunics and trousers embroidered with black thread. They wore bracelets, circlets, rings, necklaces and earrings made from bronze or silver . Those in the west owed much of their culture to the pirates who originally inhabited these areas. They dressed in contrasting colors, donning headbands and bandanas, or wore plain brown or white tunics. Jewelry here was simple and inexpensive, including brooches, earrings, nose-rings and necklaces.</p>
<p>The average Aglarondan had no concern for magic as part of everyday life, instead regarding it as best wielded by those in power. A number of Aglarondan monarchs in the Olósynne Dynasty were powerful spellcasters, but regular people with these powers were viewed with disdain. Any young children who show a particular gift for magic were recruited as apprentices by the Simbul, becoming members of the Simbul's Children .</p>
<h3>Half-Elves</h3>
<p>The Aglarondan half-elf population was mainly concentrated in and around the Yuirwood . They were a copper-skinned people, amongst whom about half had pointed ears. There was a large range of attitudes toward other cultures amongst the half-elves. Those who lived on the outskirts of the Yuirwood, nearer to the human settlements, had a more tolerant approach and adopted human traditions, such as living in houses. Those half-elves living deeper in the Yuirwood were in touch with their elven ancestry, preferring to live the elven way, in small communities, or as hunter-gatherers. Most half-elves either supported or accepted the human presence in Aglarond, but there was rumored to be a small group who were in favor of wiping them out.</p>
<p>Many of the half-elves, and the wild elves they shared their homes with, distrusted and questioned the authority of the Simbarch Council that ruled Aglarond in the 1400s DR, though it was only in the 1470s DR that their worries shifted from the ex- zulkirs of fallen Thay.</p>
<p>Magic among the half-elves was widely practiced; more so among the inhabitants of the Yuirwood. Some of the nomadic tribes still used totemic magic .</p>
<p>Half-elven dress was similar to humans in the areas near human settlements, and even so in parts of the Yuirwood. In the other parts, the half-elves dressed more like wild elves, with fur, loincloths and tattoos.</p>
<h3>Halflings</h3>
<p>As of 1368 DR , the halfling population of Aglarond was limited to a few hundred, concentrated on farmland in the area surrounding Mesring in the east. They were well-liked by both the humans and the half-elves.</p>
<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>Aglarond's economy was largely self-sufficient. It produced everything it needed in order to survive. It did, however, produce a small surplus with which it traded. Aglarond exported copper , gems , grain , lumber and Aglarondan blood wine and imported glass , iron and textiles . The half-elven community produced musical instruments and artwork from wood and silver . Aglarond did not actively seek trade with other nations; instead, it let in a small number of traders from the outside.</p>
<h2>Transportation</h2>
<p>Sea trade played an important part in Aglarondan economics. The names of vessels from Aglarond were based on the goods they carried like Spicesail or Timberhold .</p>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>There were few temples and holy sites in Aglarond, none large. Some people worshiped regularly, and others were content to show signs of faith in their manner. Aglarondans believed that the prosperity of their land was a sign that the gods favored them. Amongst the humans, the farmers tended to worship Chauntea and the seafarers Valkur and Selûne . Half-elves often venerated Mielikki , Silvanus , the Seldarine , or other human deities, depending on their profession or beliefs. The Yuir elves used to worship their pantheon of gods , who were assumed to have disappeared with the downfall of the Yuir.</p>
