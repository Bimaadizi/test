<p>Eaerith Talor was a warlock active in Athkatla during the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Eaerith was a graceful and handsome man, who regularly pretended to be a woman in order to access the parties held by local nobility or wealthy individuals. Going by the sobriquet " Luthlund of Luskan ", he relied on those events to find patrons to sponsor his adventures.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime between the Year of the Godly Invitation, 1449 DR and the Year of the Emerald Sun, 1454 DR , Eaerith suffered an attack from the Sword of Savras and consequently lost access to his pact magic. He however retained the ability to wield magic items.</p>
