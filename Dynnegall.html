<p>Dynnegall was a small village located on the isle of Moray within the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The village was located in north central Moray along the northeast shore of Lac Dynnegall , 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of Caer Moray . As of the late 15 th century DR , the roads were poorly maintained.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The village's location on the swampy Lac Dynnegall and near the Breasal Marsh provided it with an excellent source of peat , valued for heating, and of kryne , a nutritious plant. As of the late 15 th century DR, soldiers stationed in the port of Caer Moray by High King Derid Kendrick of Callidyrr had the responsibility of making sure trade flowed to and from Dynnegall.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dynnagall was named for a former king of the island. While once a flourishing town, by the late 15 th century DR, it was only begrudgingly populated by nervous settlers seeking peat and kryne in service to High King Derid. The village had a bloody history, having been completely wiped out several times by monsters. Attacks from the Black Blood Tribe occurred several times per year. Soldiers stationed here often came away with many stories of their heroics (assuming they survived), and were said to say that it was the most dangerous post in the whole of the Moonshaes.</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , adventurers were needed to help secure Dynnegall's future, both by securing the road and by helping to construct walls and barracks within the town. The High King's troops continued to struggle to reinforce Dynnagall as late as the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR . When the Black Blood tribe subsequently overran the village again, and intended to sacrifice its inhabitants at the nearby moonwell to summon Kazgoroth , the captain of the Kendrick troops at Caer Moray refused to send reinforcements because he believed (correctly) that the lycanthropes had set a trap for them.</p>
