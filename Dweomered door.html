<p>A dweomered door was a term used to describe one of many types of magical doorways.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These doors often came in odd shapes and sizes, and were masterfully crafted from exotic woods and materials. Other times a dweomered door was simple and plain in appearance, perhaps to disguise the treasures that were found behind.</p>
<h2>Use</h2>
<p>Dweomered doors were often used as a deterrent against potential thieves from reaching treasure caches or other valuables. On the other hand, they could simply be placed as a punishment for overly curious explorers. For example, the animating door would animate any corpse that was brought through its threshold, while the door of beasts , when opened, would burst open and release several monsters.</p>
<p>These unique passageways often, especially in the former instance, had additional locks and traps, both mechanical and magical attached to them.</p>
<p>These magical doors were widely used in the Shining South , especially Halruaa where they were often installed in wizard sanctums.</p>
