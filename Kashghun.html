<p>The Kashghun were a tribe of humans living on the Plain of Horses in northwestern Kara-Tur or the northeastern Hordelands . They were among the tribes mistakenly called " Tuigan " by outsiders following the Horde Wars . They were one of the three major tribes of the plain, alongside the Fankiang and the Tsu-tsu .</p>
<h2>Territory</h2>
<p>The Kashghun lived in the southern Plain of Horses, over much of the northern Quoya Desert . Their territory bordered the lands of the Fankiang , Quirish , Oigur , and Tsu-tsu tribes. They made their home around the city of Chegoyui , the largest settlement in the northeastern Quoya Desert ;</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>They spoke the Kashghun dialect of the Chuchian tongue.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Kashghun were traders and from Chegoyui they controlled all trade routes between the Plain of Horses and Shou Lung . Circa Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) , they sometimes traded with smaller tribes and with daring Shou merchants. The most prized commodity was horses , which were a regular source of prosperity for the tribe, though woolen clothes and weaponry were also exchanged. The Kashghun ran huge caravans of several hundred camels across the desert.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>A peaceful people, the Kashghun tried not to get caught up in the inter-tribe rivalries and warfare that were common on the Plain of Horses, and generally they succeeded. Despite this, the Kashghun were in a feud with the Commani tribe. On the other hand, they were friends with the Dalat tribe, had a treaty with the Tsu-tsu tribe (though neither paid it much mind), and enjoyed fairly good relations with Shou Lung.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Long ago, a great leader of the steppe called a couralitai (a grand council of the khans ), with all the tribes in attendance. During a heated argument at the council, the khan of the Commani and his sons were assassinated. The murderers escaped and were never discovered, but, after finding evidence against them, the Commani suspected the Kashghun and that the Fankiang protected the assassins. This led to hatred between the three groups, which lasted even into the mid–14 th century.</p>
<p>Some time around Shou Year 2500 (1250 DR) , the Tsu-tsu and Kashghun made a treaty against the Fankiang tribe. Their plan was to attack the city of Li-Raz from opposite sides and conquer the Fankiang there. While the Tsu-tsu launched their assault from the north, the Kashghun changed their minds at the last minute and abandoned the battle, forcing the Tsu-tsu to withdraw also. As a result, although the treaty remained in effect a century later, its terms were almost empty.</p>
