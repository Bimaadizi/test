<p>Dragonbane was a rare but extremely well-known poison that was extremely harmful to dragons .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ironically, the formulation of dragonbane originated from the same creature it was intended to harm. It was composed of the blood of three different varieties of dragons.</p>
<p>Dragonbane appeared as an opaque, bright-blue liquid.</p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>When any non-dragon creature was exposed to dragonbane, they felt extreme pain throughout their body, including their internal organs.</p>
<p>When a dragon was affected by the poison, by mere contact alone, they became unable to breath for a period of time.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Flagrant imitations of this potent poison were more often encountered in the Realms than the genuine substance. This was partially due to the fact that dragons regularly killed-on-sight any individual they encountered who carried true dragonbane.</p>
