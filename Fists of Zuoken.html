<p>Fist of Zuoken Affiliation Fists of Zuoken Class Statistics 3e 3rd Edition Statistics Prestige Class Magic Use Magic type Psionics Requirements Other Monk Wild talent List of known fists of Zuoken The Fists of Zuoken ( pronounced : / z uː ˈ oʊ k ɛ n / zoo-OH-ken ) were a famous monastic order of psionic martial artists dedicated to achieving enlightenment through mastery of both physical and mental development, constantly striving towards personal perfection. They were also devoted to the causes of finding and guiding potential psionics users, as well as safeguarding all those who wielded the Invisible Art from persecution.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>This order was affiliated with Zuoken , an Oerthian demigod of psionics, martial arts, and monks . Their name came from his holy symbol, which was a striking fist. According to legend he was once a human martial artist, who several centuries ago ascended to godhood after achieving mental and physical perfection, that being the highest level of skill possible in edel (psionics) and da'shon ("falling hail", a complicated Oerthian martial art).</p>
<p>The leader of the fists, referred to as the scion of Zouken, was peer-selected among those who were considered the nearest to enlightenment and therefore most embodied the qualities of Zuoken. Eight elder monks assisted the scion in managing the order and developing its curriculum of exercises, practices, and rituals that were meant to strengthen each aspect of the self. These monks were divided into two groups, the Masters of the Wind and the Masters of the Seasons. The former were focused on physical studies, while the latter were responsible for the order's mental exercises and scholastic studies. The scion of Zouken was often the most eldest disciple, derived from one of the two groups of elder monks.</p>
<p>Those who took up the path of a Fist of Zuoken were typically monks, often ones with a wild talent , though other types of psionics users were not restricted from joining their ranks. The majority of the order's members were of a good alignment , with a significant minority of lawful good and neutral disciples. Because of their various studies into the legendary exploits of Zuoken, it was not uncommon for members to know the Primordial language .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Fists often took up jobs as guards at monasteries that practiced psionic learning, such as Zuokenai temples, and even operated some of their own small monasteries. Many others took up the life of an adventurer , believing that the exploration, investigation, survival, and true combat that such a life entailed would more keenly hone their abilities than any amount of exercise or study. Above all else, their creed to protect psionics users and psionic creatures from persecution took top priority for Fists of Zuoken, and the life of an adventurer offered disciples more opportunity to aid those in need.</p>
<p>As they believed only strict monastic training could lead to enlightenment, disciples worked to coax those psionics users who were more fueled by passion, such as ardents and battleminds , towards taking up a more disciplined path of study.</p>
<h2>Dogma</h2>
<p>The Fists of Zuoken believed that all living creatures were innately linked to psychic energy , but that only those with the potential for
enlightenment could harness that energy. And even then, only by obtaining a measure of enlightenment – unity of the mind, body, and soul – could one hope to master the Invisible Art. Ergo, psionics users were the only mortals capable of achieving true enlightenment and reaching a greater existence following death. This system of belief encouraged the nurturing of mental powers in all who possessed them. While a disciple was responsible for their own development, helping others could aid a psionics user on this journey toward self-awareness and enlightenment.</p>
<p>When it came to the various unifying theories regarding psionics and psychic energy, members of the order generally leaned towards them being gifts of the gods or the belief that psionics users were the next evolutionary step of the mortal races.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Fists of Zuoken drew from the same well of psionic powers as psychic warriors . Like other psionics users, any powers they learned became ingrained in their minds and didn't need to prepared, like how some spellcasters needed to do for their spells . In addition to mental powers, members displayed the formidable martial art skills that one could expect from monks.</p>
