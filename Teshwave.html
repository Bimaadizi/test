<p>Teshwave was a small town in Teshendale in the Dalelands .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A ramshackle concoction of ruins, tents, and newly-built barracks and some surviving structured from pre- Zhent town, as of the late 14 th century DR . The biggest building in the city was the Manor House , noticeably well-maintained and clean, unlike the rest of the ruins. The town's garrison commander occupied the manor. Another area of interest was the Lair , a big pile of collapsed structured nestled together and used as barracks for monstrous humanoid forces of the Zhentil Keep . Teshwave's docks remained operational through the ruinous time, sending river ferries that traveled between Zhentil Keep and Dagger Falls .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The community was built along the River Tesh just south of the Dragonspine Mountains . The town was known for its scenic rapids and cascades of the River Tesh.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The town was the largest trading community in Teshendale and was controlled by the forces of Zhentil Keep. It was an exporter of wood and stone that was moved directly to Zhentil Keep. Zhents upturned and quarried out previously lush farmlands and pastures that surrounded the city. Zhentish caravans often moved west from Teshwave to the Anauroch desert.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Before destruction, Teshwave was represented in the Dales Council . When there was a government, the town was ruled by the Elder with Jaoth Hulnhurn bring the last and presumed long-dead by 1356 DR . As of the late-14 th century DR , the Dales Council kept Teshwave representative's seat open in memory of Jaoth and as a shameful reminder of not lending aid to a fellow Dale.</p>
<p>After the Zhentarim takeover, the Black Networked entrusted the entire Dale to a beholder . Manxam , The Tyrant of Teshendale, was that aberrant eye tyrant who could be found in the ruins of Teshwave and its environs. Apart from the beholder Zhent, the military leader of the outpost was a rotational position among the strongest individuals.</p>
<h2>Defense</h2>
<p>While Teshwave was protected by tribes of orcs , gnolls , and ogres , Zhentil Keep had a reserve of two to three thousand troops to defend the town.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Teshwave suffered greatly in the Year of Thunder, 1306 DR . Dragon Run descended on the region and rained destruction on the cities of Teshwave, Phlan , and Yulash . More strife was caused by orcish slavers that started regularly raiding the Dale. Just a decade later, Teshendale fell victim to Zhentil Keep's savagery in the Year of the Gulagoar, 1316 DR when the Zhent forced attacked and destroyed the Dale taking Teshwave and turning it into their outpost. Many of the town's inhabitants fled for the safety of neighboring Dales. Zhentil Keep did not seek to claim the land, instead, they aimed to completely ravage and destroy the Dale.</p>
<p>Another Rage of Dragons took place in the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR , but the dragons were driven out by the agents of Zhentil Keep. Later that year, Zhent-ally beholder Manxam took the ruined city as its base. Following the Time of Troubles of the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Fzoul Chembryl retreated to Teshwave for a time, after the demise of Bane , the patron deity of the Black Network. Eventually, Fzoul returned to the Zhentil Keep as a devoted follower of Bane's son – Iyachtu Xvim .</p>
<p>Circa the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR the town was a glorified ruin with a single inn and a sizable force of Zhents stationed there. Tyran the Outlaw, a descendant of Teshwave, gained notoriety as a bandit and aggressive opponent of the Zhent occupation. He assembled guerrilla war parties of woodcutters and rangers to strike against the Black Network and their monstrous humanoid agents. Keepers put a bounty of 500 gold pieces on the Outlaw's head. However, sages believed that even if Tyran were to succeed in driving the occupiers out, Teshendale was beyond salvage.</p>
<p>During the Order of the Crippled Fang crisis of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , the entirety of southern part of the Moonsea was consumed by panic. The strange new menace summoned fiends to sow chaos and destruction, restricting trade, and within first few weeks of the menace – attacked Teshwave. The cult targeted the Black Network and Teshwave was a clear target.</p>
