<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the late 15 th century DR , a human necromancer from the Bleak Academy was operating in Tymanther , in an ancient Untheri burial site near Ruinspoke , creating a number of undead deep within a mausoleum. Three of these undead were famine hounds, which fought to protect the necromancer when a group of adventurers invaded his lair to rescue the kidnapped dwarf Melnar .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Like many undead dogs, famine hounds were drawn towards cemeteries and other places of death. They sometimes raided towns, though preferred to live on the fringes and pick off hapless travelers. Having died of starvation, these undead had an endless hunger for the flesh of the living.</p>
