<p>The Farwater was the largely uncultivated region of Impiltur , located in the northeastern part of the realm beyond the Great Imphras River . It was a majestically beautiful but uncivilized locale that drew in Impilturan settlers and frontiersmen to its numerous fledgling farming communities.</p>
<p>Many of the region's pioneers hired adventuring parties to protect them from the ever-present threat of hobgoblins that poured down from the Earthspur Mountains .</p>
