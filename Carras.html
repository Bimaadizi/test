<p>Carras was a smuggler based in Amkethran in Amn in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The smuggler owned a large amount of equipment with every single piece being enchanted. He used a longsword , shortbow , and arrows, as well as a very strongly enchanted returning throwing axe , named K'logarath . He also wore a pair of gargoyle boots and Enkidu's full plate .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1368 DR , Carras was confronted by Balthazar 's monks, who demanded that he forfeit his merchandise to their monastery. They threatened to arrest and interrogate him if he didn't tell them where the chief smuggler Esamon was. Gorion's Ward may have stepped in and saved the smuggler from the zealous monks. If so, Carras let the ward see his gear, at a discount. The day after, he and his band packed up his bags, in order to not be compromised by the death of Balthazar's mercenaries.</p>
