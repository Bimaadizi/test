<p>Al-Qal'at , also called the Fortress , was a highly contested island in the Great Sea off the coast of northwest Zakhara around 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The island sat offshore roughly 100 miles (160 kilometers) from Qudra to the southeast and Liham to the east. The island itself measured 120 miles (190 kilometers) in length and 50 miles (80 kilometers) wide. Much of the island was dry and barren, with three separate plateaus jutting from its center. The western side of the island was forested.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Many corsair captains laid claim to the prized island because of its strategic location within easy striking distance of their hated enemy, the mamluks of Qudra. However, the corsair's inability to work together cohesively prevented any permanent presence on the island.</p>
