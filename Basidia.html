<p>Basidia was the new myconid leader of the Neverlight Grove during the late 1480s or early 1490s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Two years before, Basidia undertook a migration of its colony through the Underdark until they arrived in the Neverlight Grove, where fellow sovereign Phylo welcomed it, happy to have someone to share the burdens of leadership with.</p>
<p>During the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, the demon lord Zuggtmoy arrived in the Grove and she understood that the best strategy was to first corrupt Phylo and so gain control of the whole myconid community. Phylo was easily corrupted and so began a subtle ideological war during everyday melding to convert all the circle leaders to Zuggtmoy. Step by step, most of the myconids succumbed to madness, and only Basidia and its followers resisted.</p>
<p>Basidia asked for the help of a party of adventurers (who had escaped from drow slavers of Velkynvelve ) to investigate Phylo. Thank to the adventurers, Basidia, Rasharoo , Loobamub , and their followers abandoned the Grove before it was too late.</p>
<p>Later, Basidia discovered that Zuggtmoy intended to "marry" Araumycos and contacted the adventurers, who now led an expedition hired by Bruenor Battlehammer to stop the demon lords, asking their help to stop the demonic marriage.</p>
<p>With Basidia's help, the adventurers managed to make contact with the mind of Araumycos and helped it fight back against Zuggtmoy. Afterward, the demon lord Juiblex , who had recently arrived to steal the Queen of Fungi's prize, destroyed the physical manifestation of Zuggtmoy on Toril . Without the fungal demon lord, Basidia went back to the Neverlight Grove to clean the place and rebuild.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Basidia did not understand what had happened to Phylo and the meaning of its reforms of the grove, but sensed that they were the fruit of evil ways. It feared that Phylo had contracted some sort of "diseased spore."</p>
<h2>Relationship</h2>
<p>Since its arrival, Basidia was best friends with Phylo until the arrival of Zuggtmoy.</p>
