<p>Dramach was a magical rune of sealing. It was used as a powerful defense against intrusions, but like other sealing runes and signs, it could be bypassed or cancelled by uttering their name.</p>
<p>Philaerin used dramach to lock a special telkiira in his possession. In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Araevin Teshurr unlocked it by saying " dramach " and accessed the telkiira .</p>
