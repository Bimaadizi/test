<p>Aulagol was an illithilich wizard and a member of the Concord of Elders that governed the illithid city of Ch'Chitl in the Northdark of the Underdark in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During a visit to the Astral Plane , Aulagol allowed a raiding party of githyanki to discover his astral projection and to pursue him to the astral portion of the city's elder brain . In the Year of the Riven Skull, 1250 DR , the githyanki made a surprise attack on the city, which led to the mortal wounding of the elder brain .</p>
<p>Taking desperate measures, the ulitharid Thalynsar transformed himself and several other illithids , including Aulagol, into liches so they could devour the elder brain, preserve its knowledge and powers, and take its place. Successful in their endeavor, the illithiliches formed a Conclave of Elders , with Thalynsar as the most powerful among them. He tried to retain much of the elder brain's knowledge for himself, but the excessive information steadily turned him insane, a trait that Aulagol noted.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Thalynsar ruled Ch'Chitl for over a hundred years. Finally, around 1370 DR , Aulagol and the other Elders united and were obligated to kill the insane Thalynsar. However, they struggled to lead in his place and divide the elder brain's lore.</p>
