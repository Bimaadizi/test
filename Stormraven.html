<p>Stormraven , called the Proud Queen and the Mistress of Port Llast, was the ruler of Port Llast on the Sword Coast North in the late 13 th or early 14 th century DR . Notably, she led Port Llast into a short period of greatness and was a wielder of Namarra , the Sword That Never Sleeps.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After local warrior and trainer Thulmar One-Eye died in an event known as the Cold Winter , his enchanted sword Namarra was passed to Stormraven.</p>
<p>During her reign, Stormraven made the town of Port Llast a significant power of the northern Sword Coast, leading her forces into battle and even struggling against the city of Neverwinter , if only for a short time. Afterward, she would figure highly in the recollections of the old soldiers who'd followed her or fought against her, and was expected to live on in stories told around the fire.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>An enduring image of Stormraven was of her riding into battle at the head of her army, her hair black as jet and flying wildly behind her.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>In time, Stormraven married Pardulph of Neverwinter, a former enemy of hers.</p>
<p>They had a son, named Rivenhelm , who would grow to be one of the greatest knights in Faer√ªn by the 1350s DR . Stormraven granted Namarra to Rivenhelm.</p>
