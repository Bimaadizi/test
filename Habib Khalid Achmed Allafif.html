<p>Habib Khalid Achmed Allafif was an scimitar -wielding thief from the city of Athkatla in the midâ€“to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally from Calimshan , Habib made a living through thievery in Athkatla. In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Habib thought himself to be pursued by Athkatla's law enforcement. He may have run into Abdel Adrian one night and confused him with the city guard; the thief proudly proclaimed his name and launched his scimitar at the adventurer. It was apparently not the first time a scimitar was thrown at an innocent party, as the thief eventually made his way to a shrine to Ilmater in Athkatla's Waukeen's Promenade to pray for forgiveness for attacks and the illicit profession. Yet again, when Abdel came across Habib at Ilmater's shrine, the thief threw a handful of gold coins at the adventurer and escaped, confusing him with the guard.</p>
