<p>Laddie was an shepherd's dog that belonged to Ivrin of the Wild Pastures in the Delimbiyr Vale circa 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Unlike most other dogs, Laddie's sense of smell was quite inept on account of the hound's "frightful allergies."</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the Wild Pastures west of Liam's Hold hamlet began experiencing uncanny disappearances of cattle, sometimes in the middle of the day. Laddie and its master Ivrin the Shepherd witnessed one such disappearance firsthand. The shepherd's favorite cow Betty seemingly stopped existing after the observer duo heard strange giggling. Goblin tribe in service of the devil Gorgomorz armed with shaman brews of invisibility were to blame.</p>
