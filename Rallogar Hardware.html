<p>Rallogar Hardware , or Rallogar's Hardware , was a hardware store located in the city of Wheloon in Cormyr . Its proprietor was Zendaros Rallogar .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Rallogar Hardware was situated opposite the Wheloon Watch House , and on the corner of Wheloon Way and the Way of the Manticore .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The building was once a stables before being converted into a hardware store. Rallogar Hardware was in business by 1358 DR . It was still in business through 1369 DR , and in 1374 DR .</p>
<p>Rallogar Hardware provided supplies monthly to the newly built Temple of Mystra . Lady of Mystery Naedaenya Arthas was writing to negotiate better rates in early Eleint .</p>
<h2>Structure & Interior</h2>
<p>The building still resembled an old and dusty stables, including a hayloft stuffed with old junk.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The store sold a variety of hardware goods. These ranged from rusty scrap metal to new metal goods, such as nails. Among them was a full range of hooks, from small, fine hooks for hanging masks and wigs, to big barge hooks. Zendaros made sure to keep good stocks of rope and wire , of all lengths and thicknesses, from strangling wire to thick ship towing cables . These were sold as small pieces or by the bale, and there were huge drums of 1000-foot-long (305-meter-long) hempen rope for sale too. Zendaros made good business selling rope and wire to merchants who needed to tie cargo down. Miscellaneous other goods for sale included hair combs , backpacks , wineskins , and almost everything else. The store did not, however, sell weapons and armor , with these trades left to other stores.</p>
<p>Rallogar Hardware also did not buy or sell magic items , ostensibly because Zendaros despised magic. Customers who asked were forced out of the store. However, Zendaros actually ran a prosperous black market trade in magic items, weapons, armor and so on. One of his employees later approached the curious customer to broker a deal.</p>
<p>The stock was mostly unorganized, bar the rope and wire, so finding a specific item could be lengthy and tedious. It was described as a browser's paradise.</p>
<p>Desperate people sometimes paid Zendaros well to let them hide in the hayloft, to either avoid a Purple Dragon patrol or eavesdrop on others.</p>
