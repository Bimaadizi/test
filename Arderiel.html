<p>The search of the Shield of the Roadwarden led the group to an ogre cave village in the Storm Horns . Arderiel witnessed image of Arelin Starbrow in a crystal ball, alive and well, and he immediately rushed to what he thought was the Roadwarden. The woman he found looked like the hero but in reality was just a trick of the mastermind behind the ogre and ogre magi alliance, a fiendish rakshasa who claimed the Shield of the Roadwarden . A second rakshasa joined the fray, but both were slain by the adventurers who claimed the enchanted item and returned it to Kallithrea Starbrow.</p>
