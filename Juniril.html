<p>Juniril (seen as "Junirill" on some maps ) was a quiet fishing village in eastern Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Juniril was a bland and boring town, where very little of interest seemed to happen. The main item of interest to travelers was the High Helm tavern, that was shaped like an enormous helm.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The village sat near the Hullack Trail on the southeast shore of Wyvernwater , in the greater Wyvernshores area. Extensive bogs lay nearby, home to doppelgangers and mimics .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR, the village was administered by House Belorgan . At the time it was expected that Raedlar Belorgan would become the Earl of Juniril, though he died attempting to assassinate Princess Tanalasta in 1369 DR .</p>
<p>As of 1486 DR , the village was ruled by the elderly Lord Santedul .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Juniril's folk mainly fished and wove rushes from the bogs or worked the local fruit farms. According to wider Cormyr, the primary export was boredom.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Around the 1360s DR a small Purple Dragons detachment garrisoned the village, consisting of seven soldiers, most of whom were veteran women. They had a small barracks, stables, and jail, and typically defended the village from doppelgangers who lurked in the nearby bogs and raided the village.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some centuries before the 14 th century DR, Princess Kathla Obaryskyr was waylaid by brigands in Juniril. When she was dealt a mortal blow at the doors of Helm's Everpresent Shield , she uttered a curse and the brigands were pierced with blades of energy, but kept alive indefinitely.</p>
<p>Juniril was the site of a battle between King Galaghard 's armies and those of the Witch Lords in 900 DR .</p>
<p>A book recounting Juniril's history was published around 1327 DR ; Phelos Marmwitz searched for ages and was pleased to get a copy of this "splendid volume" for his library in Ghars in Eleint of 1367 DR .</p>
<p>During the Great Rain of 1486 DR , the village was almost completely isolated by flooding and raiders, with Lord Santedul's family and many of the local villagers sent away either to fight or to safety. On Eleint 28 , Havilar , Mehen , Kallan , and Aubrin Crownsilver escorted Crown Prince Irvel Obarskyr to Juniril on their way to Suzail. They stayed briefly and met with Lord Santedul before moving on.</p>
