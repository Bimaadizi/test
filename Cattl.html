<p>After Tecco, the Prophet of Zaltec, received divine commands from the holy pillar of Zaltec to find the southern valley of their future and from there to conquer the world, the Nahuat tribe wandered the lands for many years. The exact number of years the people who would become the Nexala wandered the True World in search of the prophesied land was unrecorded by historians. But in the Year of the Restless, 1099 DR , Cattl, Tecco's grandson, led the tribe to the Valley of Nexal . The lush green valley became home to the Mazticans, eventually becoming the Nexalan empire of the True World. The pillar of Zaltec was carried by the Nahuats and with Cattl's command â€“ became part of the Valley.</p>
