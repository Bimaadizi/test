<p>The Raunstrar were an exclusively female band of brigands and prostitutes that operated out of the eastern edge of the Forest of Amtar in southeast Faer√ªn circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>The Raunstrar approached caravans on the Trader's Way when they were camped for the night, selling sex and trading any sort of goods, especially fabrics, that they had. The Raunstrar used this interaction to scout a caravan's cargo, guards, and defenses so they could rob the caravan in the next few days. Their raids were usually clandestine, sneaking in and stealing what they could carry away unnoticed, but they were known to openly attack smaller or badly defended caravans when they had the upper hand.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Raunstrar lived in the fringe of the eastern Forest of Amtar close to the Trader's Way.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The membership consisted of humans and half-elves , all female.</p>
