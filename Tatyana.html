<p>Tatyana was a young Barovian woman. When count Strahd von Zarovich fell desperately in love with her, his unrequited obsession drove him to seal a pact with the Dark Powers , turning him into a vampire and plunging the entire valley into the Domains of Dread .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tatyana was extraordinarily beautiful. She had auburn hair.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally a peasant woman from the village of Barovia, Tatyana was in love with and engaged to marry Sergei , Strahd's brother. However, Strahd fell madly in love with Tatyana immediately upon seeing her. Strahd's pride prevented him from voicing his feelings until their wedding day, when he killed his brother and drank his blood as part of a deal with the Dark Powers to make Tatyana his bride. Horrified by what Strahd had done, Tatyana jumped from the cliff that overlooked the valley below Castle Ravenloft .</p>
<p>As part of the deal made with the Dark Powers, Strahd was not allowed to die, rising as a vampire after being shot by the castle's guards. Tatyana's soul became trapped in the newly formed Domain of Dread of Barovia, doomed to repeatedly reincarnate as part of the Dark Powers' punishment against Strahd.</p>
<p>Sometime before the Year of the Wandering Elfmaid, 1072 DR , a fragment of Tatyana's soul managed to escape her prison in Barovia and found its way to Waterdeep , taking the form of Anna, an incurably insane woman who had been locked up in an asylum. There, she was found by the vampire Jander Sunstar , who fell in love with her and took care of the traumatized woman. In Midwinter of the Year of the Rose, 1098 DR , when an unaging Anna fell grievously ill, Jander drank her blood until she died, and then proceeded to find the one responsible for her condition in Barovia.</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , Tatyana reincarnated again as Ireena Kolyana .</p>
