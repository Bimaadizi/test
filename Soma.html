<p>Soma was an interloper deity of moons, plants, and prophecies in the Vedic pantheon . There was no evidence that this deity was directly worshiped in the Realms.</p>
<h2>Avatar</h2>
<p>The avatar of Soma generally took the form of a giant with silver-skin, though at other times he was known to manifest as a bird or bull . His true form was said to be that of a moon.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>This deity was generally a charitable and kind person, but they were also rather proud and vain.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Rather than calling upon the divine spells of his spheres , the avatar of Soma typically utilized arcane spells from the phantasms sub-school of Illusion .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Soma carried an enchanted dagger that caused those struck by it to momentarily become convinced that they were struck dead.</p>
<h2>Realm</h2>
<p>Soma resided on the Ysgard layer (or "Asgard") of the plane of Ysgard , where he shared the divine realm known as the Gates of the Moon with Selûne , the Faerûnian goddess of the moon of Realmspace .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>With Selune's blessing, the petitioners of Soma distilled a juice from special flowers that were dotted around the Gates of the Moon. This juice was rumored to provide insight into the future. Soma also devoted a portion of his time to amassing a collection of beautiful things, for the deity believed that the horde of items reflected well upon his person.</p>
<h2>Relationship</h2>
<p>Much like Selune, Soma was served by both lillendi and lycanthropes . However, unlike Selune, he also commanded a legion of asuras . These servants of his were rarely seen outside the Gates of the Moon and were unrecognizable to most petitioners in Ysgard.</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>In addition to divine spells from Soma's spheres, his priests were provided the spells find the path , plant growth , and programmed illusion .</p>
