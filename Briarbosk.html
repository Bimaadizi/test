<p>Briarbosk was a sy-tel-quessir village in the Tangled Vale</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Briarbosk was inhabited by the wild elven clan of the same name. The village became the first target of the green dragon , Venominhandar 's, assault against elven communities of Cormanthor in −982 DR , but the local elves survived.</p>
<p>The surviving elves of the clan met their end years later in an ill-fated attempt to avenge themselves on Venominhandar. The attacker's on Venom's Lair died all and sundry leaving Briarbosk abandoned.</p>
<p>A couple of decaying tree dwellings was all that was left of the village. It was rumored that Briarbosk's ruins were visited by the baelnorn from the Vale of Lost Voices . Some said the baelnorn came there to reminisce about their bygone days of life.</p>
