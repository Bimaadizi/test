<p>House Melarn was a drow house in Ched Nasad that fell with the destruction of Ched Nasad during the Silence of Lolth in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>House</h2>
<p>House Melarn's compound was a huge cyst-like bulge on the second-highest level of the city.</p>
<p>The waiting room at House Melarn was covered in statues and frescos with motifs of spiders, webs, drow, and musical instruments. There was a broken bust of Mathira Melarn in House Melarn's great hall.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>House Melarn and House Baenre of Menzoberranzan owned the Black Claw Mercantile Company , whose storehouses were operated by House Zauvirr .</p>
<p>House Melarn had a secret family tradition: chosen females studied bae'qeshel bardic magic to become "dark minstrels."</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to its fall, House Melarn had stood for twenty centuries or more.</p>
<p>In 1372 DR, Matron Mother Ssipriina Zauvirr hired the duergar mercenary band Clan Xornbane to assist in an attempt to destroy House Melarn. Ssipriina took over the Black Claw storehouses, killing Matron Mother Drisinil Melarn . Unfortunately, Clan Xornbane was given the direction to attack House Melarn prematurely, destroying the house with stonefire bombs and causing it to collapse into the city cavern. This contributed to overall chaos in the city, which (as part of a Jaezred Chaulssin plot directed by Zammzt ) rapidly destroyed itself.</p>
<p>Sometime in 1366 or 1377 DR , Q'arlynd Melarn discovered that the sigil of House Melarn, which resembled a dancing stick figure, was in fact a crude depiction of Eilistraee , and showed that some of the drow that remained were free from the Taint of Wendonai and still had in them a speck of good.</p>
