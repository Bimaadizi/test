<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR , a group of dark naga worshipers of Llash infested and desecrated the ruined shrine of Mystra in the City of Song, Myth Drannor . The spine was under the protection of Anorrweyn Evensong , a follower of the Lady of Mystery who perished in the Weeping War but returned as a ghost , serving her goddess in death as she did in life. The nagas covered the holy symbol of Mystra with the image of their snake god, drawn in crude black paint. The nagas— Kog , Skerndli and Gorgat —were powered by one of pool of radiance 's spawn pools that fed on their evil worship. The nagas were slain by the heroes known as the Veiled Ones . With their death and the destruction of the idol, Llash's name and symbols that were painted over the shrine dissolved, freeing the ghost from the god's dark influence. Several other Llash idols were found across the ruins of the city.</p>
