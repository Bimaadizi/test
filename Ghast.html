<p>Ghasts were a more powerful subtype of ghouls .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They resembled very closely their undead cousin, except perhaps being just a bit more slender and ghost-like. The stench of death and rot lingered around their undead forms. This stench could often be smelled from a 10 ft (3 m) radius and was terrible enough to cause nausea, retching, and in rare cases even paralysis.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like most undead, ghasts were immune to mind-affecting spells such as charm and sleep . Though they were known to be especially vulnerable to weapons made of cold iron .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Ghasts were also far more deadly and cunning than ghouls, with their paralytic touch dangerously affecting their opponents, including elves .</p>
<p>The bite of a ghast could transmit ghoul fever , a disease which killed its victims and then raised them as a new ghoul or ghast.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Much like ghouls, ghasts were typically encountered around graveyards.</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>Much like ghouls, ghasts spoke whatever language they did in life.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Ghasts often laired with others of their own kind or acted as the leaders of a group of normal ghouls.</p>
<p>When it came to non-undead creatures, ghasts were often enslaved to demons . Some ghasts acted as servants of the deity Kiaransalee .</p>
