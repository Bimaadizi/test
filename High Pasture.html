<p>High Pasture was a set of ruins near the village of Volkumburgh .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>By the 14 th century DR these ruins had fallen into such a state of disrepair that it was difficult to ascertain what it once was. It could have been either a barn or some workshop.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>These ruins were located in the Volkumburgh Vale , northeast of the village of the same name and the residents of its inhabitants Clemon and Wistkins .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This area became a ruin in the mid-12 th century DR, when the devil -possessed stone golem known as Awtawmatawn rampaged throughout Volkumburgh Vale.</p>
<p>In 1358 DR , in the month of Uktar some time prior to the Feast of the Moon , the Volkumburgh shepherd Deker was clearing out these ruins in hopes of constructing a new barn. While doing so one of his sheep walked up to and bit a runestick that made it seemingly disappear. Later on a group of adventurers seeking out the scattered remains of the Awtawmatawn on behalf of Amelior Amanitas came to enquire about this incident and found that the runestick acted as a two-way portal to another runestick near the ruins of the College of Rune Magics .</p>
