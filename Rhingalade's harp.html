<p>Rhingalade's harp was a magical harp used by the Harpers .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When played, the harpist became aware of the special power of the harp. After several minutes of playing, the harpist could utilize the harp's magic at will. By silently willing it, the harpist could blink for as long as they want while playing the harp, and mirror images would be created. These images blinked in a similar manner to the harpist, but with slight differences so that the harpist or at least one of their images was always visible.</p>
<p>The mirror images lasted until hit by a physical attack or until the music stops. However, the harpist was unable to cast spells, use magical items, or make weapon attacks without ending the harp's music. Once the music stopped, the harp's special power couldn't be used until some time has passed, even if the harpist resumed playing immediately.</p>
