<p>The Grave District of Athkatla was the city's southernmost ward and essentially a vast graveyard, full of ornately designed mortuaries and crypts. Beneath the stone walkways of the ward were a series of multi-leveled tombs, interconnected by trapped passageways.</p>
<p>Located in the southernmost section of the city, the grave district was walled off from the other wards, though it could be entered via the Cold Dolor. The Sparandar Gate led south, out of the city.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The mausoleums within the grave district were often used for secret meetings and clandestine rendezvous. It was not uncommon for Athkatlans to have day-time meals between the tomb-markers and headstones.</p>
<p>At night, the district was heavily patrolled by city guards to stop unlawfulness, such as vagrant Athkatlans from setting up shanty communities in tents and lean-tos.</p>
