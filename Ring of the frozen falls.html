<h2>History</h2>
<p>As it was tradition before embarking on one's dai jemma , one young man camped at the Falls of Erech , a grand waterfall on the northwestern-most edge of Rashemen. All those who set out on their journey of adulthood were to spend at least one night at the Falls of Erech and give an offering to the raging waters. So did the young man before going to sleep. As he slept, a group of Nar barbarians discovered him and began circling the young Raashemaar, intending to murder and rob him. However, before the dark deed could commence, a spirit possessed the young man, and he easily defeated the attackers, showing stunning skill and powerful savagery. Once the attackers were all dead, the spirit left the youth's body. He looked around and found a new ring on his finger. It was a protective gift from the spirit.</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , one such ring was found witin the Bear God's Barrow north of Mulsantir .</p>
