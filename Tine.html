<p>Tine was a tumbler and performer that traveled in a troupe along with their siblings in cities across the Realms during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Tine and their siblings were a bit odd in a manner that could be considered rude. When strangers approached the trio in public, they would not speak directly to them unless that person proved to be genuinely entertaining. In those instances, they would freely offer their names and relations to each other.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Tine was one of three triplets, along with their siblings Tane and Tawn .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>One of the three had on their person a bag of vaguely magic dust that would expand into a large cloud when thrown.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time during the 1480s DR, the trio of tumblers arrived in Phlan on the Moonsea North region to perform their act. On at least one occasion, the three siblings spent their off-time at Madame Freona's Tea Kettle .</p>
