<p>Sree was a Rashemi Wychlaran who adopted the young daughter of Yaraella , a Witch believed to have committed suicide to end the troubling visions she received from the spirit world. In reality, Sree killed Yarealla because she refused to join the Wychlaren and so Sree could raise the young girl to become a powerful witch. Sree was killed by vengeful water spirits in 1480 DR during a Wychlaran circle ritual.</p>
