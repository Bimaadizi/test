<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Pridelands were created in the aftermath of the Godswar , with Nobanion having created the permanent portal that connected the divine realm to his longstanding territory on the Prime Material , Gulthmere Forest.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>This divine realm was primarily inhabited by members of Nobanion's Great Pride, lammasu and wemics , as well as his petitioners . Like other divine realms in the House of Nature, Nobanion's humanoid petitioners would gradually take on animal traits, particularly those of felines. And over the course of centuries, they would transform into celestial animals . The sole exception to this were Nobanion's wemic petitioners, who maintained their mortal forms indefinitely.</p>
