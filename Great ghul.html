<p>Great ghuls were undead cousins of genies who occupied the lowest rung in the hierarchy of the jann .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Great ghuls had one interesting featureâ€”their feet were always donkey hooves, although they often tried to hide this shortcoming by wearing long robes or boots. Ghuls adored eating the flesh from corpses and then drinking the bone marrow. They often had long hair and bushy eyebrows. They had clawed fingers and well developed muscles. Their white skin was always sticky and cold. Great ghuls knew that their looks were repulsive, so they often tried to hide their ugliness with lush sarafans and jewelry .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Only holy water and magic weapons could injure or kill a great ghul. They were much weaker during the daytime than at night. Being undead, great ghuls had a special immunity to poison and many mind-affecting spells.</p>
<p>Great ghuls were capable of casting a variety of spells including bestow invisibility , polymorph self , and shocking grasp . Because of their spellcasting prowess, great ghul magicians were much more dangerous than their simple relatives.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Great ghuls attacked enemies with sharp claws and teeth. Thanks to their great strength and claws, ghuls could climb on flat surfaces to surprise prey.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Great ghul mages lived in seclusion but most ghuls lived in pairs. Many great ghuls adored perfume , using it to hide their disgusting smell.</p>
<p>The great ghuls had a sheikh named Sahin Sira .</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Great ghuls preferred living in ruins or caves of the high mountains. They were often found in cemeteries where they fed on corpses. Their ability to polymorph helped them sneak into cities to find food.</p>
<p>Beyond the land of Zakhara, great ghuls could be found in some areas of the Domains of Dread .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>People were usually afraid of the great ghuls and genies generally despised them, so they would often conceal their appearance by using spells. Despite this, great ghuls often performed tasks for genies and even helped people if they took an interest.</p>
