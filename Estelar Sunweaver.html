<p>Estelar Sunweaver was an elf supremacist in Tethyr in 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Estelar worked for the Serôs aquatic elf tyrant Gantar Kraok , acting as one of his agents on the surface.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1370 DR, under the orders of Gantar and disguised thanks to his hat of disguise , Estelar followed the Company of the Anvil after they had recovered the Sondarr Scepter from a long-forgotten dwarven tomb in the Starspire Mountains .</p>
<p>On Uktar 10 , he was in the Blue Badger Inn in the village of Toralth . posing as the bard Fylson Tarasp .</p>
<p>However in the inn were also the Shields of the Highland , depressed for the loss of two of their companions and demanded to Estelar to compose a dirge for their two fallen friends.</p>
<p>Later that night, three dwarves , Bapar Ghalmrin , Odak Truesteel , and Soram Battlebellow , entered the tavern seeking the Sondarr Scepter and interrupting the ballad that Fylson was singing for Dumax . This greatly angered the Shields of the Highland . When Bramas Thorntree , another patron, accused some of the other patrons of stealing the Scepter , Timor, Karr , and Vajal got up from their chairs and began throwing their beer mugs and swinging their chairs. Timor's mug struck the dwarf leader Bapar, and a tavern brawl started when Soram stepped up to defend his prince. Bramas and his companions, the Company of the Anvil , used this as an opportunity to escape with the Scepter . Estelar found a nice, out-of-the-way spot and watched the brawl.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Estelar strongly believed that elves must rule the world. He agreed with the Saratycoron 's ideas but acted only after careful preparation. He became a master in using his hat of disguise , creating many personalities to interact with others.</p>
