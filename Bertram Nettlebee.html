<p>Bertram Nettlebee was the son of Wiggan Nettlebee during the Elemental Evil crisis.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Bertram was a very fanatical believer of the cult, and full of bluster. However, he had no clear idea of the true objective of the cult.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Like his father, Bertram was fascinated by the Cult of the Black Earth and joined the cult, becoming an initiate. Thanks to the cultists, the Nettlebee became ever richer.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1491 DR , after some adventurers had defeated the earth cultists at the Sacred Stone Monastery , the cult's leaders ordered Wiggan and Bertram to set a trap to kill the adventurers. They spread rumors about a "fire witch" in their fields, burning an old Uthgardt barrow mound, in order to lure the adventurers.</p>
<p>When the adventurers came to investigate the mound, Wiggan summoned an earth elemental to destroy the mound and kill all inside. However, this also awoke a dead chieftain of the Elk tribe , Javor . Javor rose as a revenant wanting revenge against Wiggan and Bertram. Somehow, the adventurers resolved the situation and Bertram was killed.</p>
