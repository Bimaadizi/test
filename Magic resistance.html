<p>Various creatures steeped in magic, like the drow and most dragons and fiends , possessed magic resistance, as did strongly anti-magical ones. The likelyhood to negate any one spell or effect varied widely between different species.</p>
<h2>Through Magic</h2>
<p>Certain magical items, like a potion of magic resistance or robe of the archmagi , also granted this ability.</p>
<p>The pluma spell also named magic resistance was used to cancel magic in a limited area, but worked technically closer to an anti-magic shell .</p>
<p>The spells lower resistance , pierce magic resistance and pierce any shield on the other hand were designed to improve the chance to overcome creatures' innate resistance against magic.</p>
