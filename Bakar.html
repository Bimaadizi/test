<p>Bakar was a survivor state of the Imaskar Empire that disappeared in approximately 300 DR when the River Athis dried up due to the curse of Bakar's last pharaoh, Amun-Re .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bakar was originally a survivor state of the Imaskari empire. The Kingdom of Bakar ruled over the valley of the River Athis in the Raurin ; though all of Raurin was already a desert, the valley was greened by the waters of the magical fountain of Athis. After the fall of the Imaskari, it became ruled by pharaohs, and their people worshiped the Mulhorandi pantheon ; their last dynasty was the house of Mo-Pelar. The last pharaoh of Mo-Pelar, Amun-Re, had waged war on the neighbors of Bakar and instituted severe tax policies with the express purpose of building himself a theft-proof, sumptuous tomb. These unpopular policies culminated in a riot in Terbakar where he was killed, around 300 DR . Before his death, the pharaoh laid down a death curse, so that if he were killed, the fountain of the Athis would flow no more.</p>
<p>As the Curse of Amun-Re took effect, the river Athis dried. This slowly led to the depopulation of Terbakar itself, and the other cities along its bed, including Akhir , Pazar , and Phoenix . Even Medinat Muskawoon further north on the Athis valley, well beyond Bakar's borders, was rendered uninhabitable as a result of the curse though they were not within the Lands of Bakar. The curse was lifted in 1356 DR when adventurers took the Star of Mo-Pelar and the Staff of Ruling from the Pyramid of Amun-Re , though the waters needed years to restore the river to its former level.</p>
