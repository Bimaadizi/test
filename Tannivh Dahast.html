<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1374 DR , Tannivh organized the Elves of Cormanthor as an allied forced alongside the Elven Crusade as it led to Myth Drannor. Less focused on martial pursuits, his group was primarily dedicated to the exploration and reconstruction of the ruins they found, based at a fortified camp near the city. They were shortly joined by Eilistraee's Wanderers , a group of overly enthusiastic drow led by Kelgoth Darksong . While the elves met a great many challenges in the city, the greatest was that of the Red Wizards of Thay , who sent a strike force led by Droic Orgul to loot the ruins.</p>
