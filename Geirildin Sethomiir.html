<p>Geirildin Sethomiir was the coronal of the Ilythiiri house Sethomiir . He was a dark elf and powerful mage during the time of the Crown Wars .</p>
<p>He summoned the balor Wendonai in −11,500 DR to help him against the Aryvandaari and to help him in achieving a leading position among the other dark elven clans. Ultimately, this drove the dark elves into the arms of Lolth and was one of the causes for their so-called Descent.</p>
