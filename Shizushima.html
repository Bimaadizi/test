<p>Shizushima was an island located in Kozakura .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The solitary island of Shizushima was found within a bay of the same name. From a distance, the island gave off the impression of verdant fertility, displaying gravel beaches and enticing inlets. However, the bay and the surrounding waters were drained of fish, while eerie apparitions and mysterious lights manifested along the island's shores. It was widely regarded as a place of immense malevolence, prompting all to steer clear and avoid it as of Kozakuran Year 1431 (1357 DR) .</p>
<p>Even the Konishi ninja , renowned for their knowledge and secrets, were uncertain about the enigmatic nature of Shizushima. Those who dared to set foot on the island and ventured out of sight from the shore never returned. Whatever darkness shrouded the island remained confined to its boundaries, emphasizing the importance of leaving it undisturbed and untouched.</p>
