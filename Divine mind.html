<p>A divine mind was a psionics wielding holy warrior, who channeled their control of the Invisible Art through faith and commitment to the ethics and values of their chosen god . As psionic paragons of their belief, these warriors were able to distill their passion towards a particular universal concept a god represented into a psionic mantle of thematic powers. They were akin to a paladin among the various types of psionics wielders.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Across the Realms, divine minds were comparatively far fewer in number than the more common psionic pathways of the psion , psychic warrior , soulknife , and wilder . Beyond Toril , they could be found on the worlds of Eberron and Oerth .</p>
<p>While they were most frequently encountered on their own, a recluse in the worst of cases, divine minds could often be found living in organized religious structures, such as a monastery or temple.</p>
<p>The alignment of a divine mind could fall anywhere within the spectrum. They were generally composed and even-tempered folk, not lusting for power or viewing themselves as the leader of any group they were in. Nor did they conceitedly thinking they (or their church) should have the majority of treasure from any adventure or quest they were in. Much like paladins, with their code of conduct or personal oath, divine minds swore themselves to the requisite ethics of their deity's alignment. They lacked the self-righteous disdain that often plagued paladins and their interactions with lay folk, though would speak up if they felt a particular deed was against the dictate or philosophy of their chosen faith.</p>
<p>Divine minds were equally as likely to come from any of the psionically-inclined sentient races, but humans seemed most apt to follow such a path. Savage and monstrous humanoids generally lacked the necessary studies to become divine minds.</p>
<h3>Religions</h3>
<p>Divine minds as a whole were not found to lean towards any one deity in particular, though it was not uncommon for them to show favor towards deities whose portfolio included War, such as Bane , Torm , or Tyr . While some felt a calling from a particular god, many chose a philosophy to follow and then a god that matched it. And whichever deity they chose to devote themselves to, it was usually one who would not be opposed to their alignment.</p>
<p>One could find a divine mind dedicated to any one of the deities of the Faerûnian pantheon , as well as Corellon Larethian , Garl Glittergold , Gruumsh , Moradin , Yondalla , and even Vecna . However, they were most frequently found among religions with a specific connection to psionics, such as Deep Duerra , Deneir , Ilsensine , Laduguer , Pisaethces , and Sseth . During the time of Jhaamdath , divine minds within the empire typically worshiped Auppenser , and some could still be found worshiping the god in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<p>Compared to divine spellcasters , paladins, and priests , they were more detached from the religion they followed, for rather than revering the sanctity of the god, a divine mind revered the concepts and philosophies that deity represented. This resulted in them often being beneath a god's notice. Nevertheless, many divine minds considered themselves to be representatives of their chosen deity, whose presence in any adventure or quest legitimized it as holy.</p>
<p>Some divine minds who revered either Talos or Umberlee took their devotion to the concept of storms to greater heights, becoming what were known as storm disciples .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Being fervid warriors of faith, divine minds found the most joy in dealing with other members of their faith, such as clerics and paladins. However, they would enthusiastically adventure with with anyone those whose powers and proficiencies supplemented their own.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Divine minds, like ardents , drew their psionic powers from psionic mantles, distillations of universal concepts and philosophies. Divine minds mentally distilled the essence of one attribute from their chosen deity's portfolio to create and adorn themselves with a mantle, a framework of mental desire. Overtime they drew more powers from their chosen mantle as their faith and mental strength grew, until eventually a divine mind could draw upon other aspects of their deity's portfolio, learning a second and even third psionic mantle.</p>
<p>In addition to psionic powers, divine minds could channel the welfare of their god into a unique psionic ability when psionically focused. The effects and benefits of this mantle power varied widely depending upon the psionic mantle that the divine mind followed. Additionally, all divine minds began their journey with some form of wild talent , granting them initial access to their mantle power.</p>
<p>The most distinct power of the divine mind was that of the psychic aura. All divine minds could express a basic defensive , offensive , or perception -based aura, in addition to a specialized aura derived from their divine mantle. These auras affected them and their allies, or in some cases their enemies. For novices the psychic aura had a radius of 5 feet (1.5 meters), but as they progressed over time its area of coverage would grow longer, with masters expressing psychic auras that were 50 feet (15 meters). Novices could only express one psychic aura at a time, while the more experienced could express two, and the masters of their field were capable of having three active at a time.</p>
<p>Just as a paladin could be deprived of their divine abilities if they ever violated the code of conduct laid down by his or her patron, particularly if they showed no sign of repentance, so too could a divine mind lose their mantle powers and abilities. Once "fallen," a divine mind could not regain their mantles without atoning for their transgressions in an appropriate manner.</p>
<p>Beyond these various powers and abilities, divine minds were often skilled in the arts of autohypnosis and psicraft . In battle they were exceptionally capable and flexible martial combatants, equally capable with most armors and weapons , though would never be found wielding tower shields and tended to lean towards melee weaponry.</p>
