<p>Hydrophane was a variety of opal that was highly prized by sailors and the aquatic races of Faer√ªn because its true beauty was only visible when wet.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This semi-precious stone was typically used for inlay work or cut cabochon for jewelry. It was a rather plain, opaque, ivory or frosty-white color when dry, but when immersed in water it became transparent with a prism-like rainbow iridescence. A typical stone had a base value of 50 gp.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Hydrophane was used in various potions and magic items related to water, especially those that allowed control over water elementals or water breathing . If used as an additional material component for the color spray spell, it decreased the chance that targets would resist the spell.</p>
