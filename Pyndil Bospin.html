<p>Pyndil Bospin was an elf sage who specialized in portals and the planes , who investigated the ruins of Myth Drannor in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Pyndil had long silvery hair and brown eyes. He wore an ornate green set of robes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Pyndil was a senior member of the Elves of Cormanthor at their forward camp outside of Myth Drannor. He provided expertise on the subject of the planar instability caused by the mythal , which caused a number of unusual hazards and threats inside the ruins.</p>
<p>He kept an eye on a particular portal that opened in the campsite, which seemed to lead to the world of Eberron where the Gatekeeper Oxal Ekkam monitored his own end of the portal . Pyndil was quite relieved that only adventurers came through instead of monsters.</p>
