<p>During the year-long presence of the Cult of the Dragon around 1489 DR , she would still come into Parnast, but tried to avoid being seen. After the cult was defeated, she took up permanent residence in the shrine. After having lived there for about half a year, she started to look into acquiring a new statue of Angharradh for the Shrine of Axes, to replace the one broken during the occupation by the Cult of the Dragon.</p>
<p>Sometime around 1490 DR , Chandra had lived in Parnast for just about half a year when she was suddenly targeted by the giant Bad Fruul .</p>
