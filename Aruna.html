<h2>History</h2>
<p>Goodwife Aruna hailed from the hamlet of Wanderfen in the Mere of Dead Men. When it started being reclaimed by the swamp, the woman left the village and relocated to a settlement north of Wanderfen called West Harbor. She was thankful to the villagers who welcomed her with open arms, and she gladly paid them back with her healing magics and skills in medicine. She often welcomed visitors to the village, offering them blessings of Chauntea and healing at no charge. Given opportunity, Aruna was willing to give up her enchanted staff in exchange for a brave adventurer returning the Goodwife's lost shawl. She claimed that a gang of lizardfolk picked up the shawl Aruna dropped while fleeing her previous home.</p>
