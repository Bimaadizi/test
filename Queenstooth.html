<p>The Queenstooth kobolds , also known as the Queen's Teeth , were a tribe of black-scaled kobolds who resided in Forestfall Fen as of the late 15 th century DR . Their name was derived from their service to their "Queen", the black dragon Vorazidrar .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The kobolds' main duties were to provide "gifts" to their Queen and to wage war on other inhabitants of Forestfall Fen. They patrolled the outer areas of the swamp and fiercely defended the center of the Fen—where Throden village and Vorazidrar's lair were located—from all potential invaders.</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>In combat, the Queenstooth kobolds wielded scimitars and javelins, and would mercilessly taunt their enemies. They were adept at using the dangerous terrain of Forestfall Fen as both a layer of defense and a weapon in their arsenal.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>They operated out of a hidden lizardfolk village near Vorazidrar's lair known as Throden.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Queenstooth kobolds lived alongside the lizardfolk of Throden to their mutual benefit. They unfailingly served their Queen, Vorazidrar, as her "teeth", which she herself never used in battle.</p>
<p>They were mortal enemies of any who would threaten their village or queen, notable the Muckgrunter trolls and the many monsters that resided in Forestfall Fen.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Queenstooth kobolds arrived in Forestfall Fen alongside their Queen sometime before the 15 th century DR. Discovering that they needed the aid of strong allies to survive the Fen, they joined with the lizardfolk of Thorden and helped to build up the village into a settlement for both groups.</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, a new threat emerged when meenlocks began invading from the Feywild , having taken advantage of the weakening of the barrier between the planes owing to Vorazidrar's magic . Led by Spittleburn , the kobolds fiercely fought back the invasion of meenlocks, but sought to seize and control—rather than destroy—the Feywild gates through which they emerged. Soon the conflict spiraled further out of control as the bloodshed awoke the Fen's dormant holdfast vines .</p>
<p>Not long after, adventurers from Waterdeep arrived to investigate Forestfall Fen, and despite the Queenstooth kobolds' best efforts, they fought their way to the Queen and trapped her inside her lair. Although this broke her hold over Throden, it did not stop her continued desire for tribute from her minions, and soon she sought to rally the Queenstooth kobolds for war.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>Queenstooth kobolds had black-scales and spoke the Draconic language . It was thought that they were cousins of the red-scaled kobolds who were members of the Burntbone Horde .</p>
<p>Their leader in the late 15 th century DR was Spittleburn, who of course was simply a servant of Queen Vorazidrar.</p>
