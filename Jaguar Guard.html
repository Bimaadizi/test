<p>The Jaguar Guard was a mercenary company from Maztica based in Tethyr in the mid–14 th century DR . They were composed of Jaguar Knights from the city-state of Kultaka in Maztica.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the Kultakans aided in the Golden Legion 's conquest of Nexal in the Year of the Helm, 1362 DR , the leaders of Kultaka realized the continent of Maztica had been opened to foreign explorers and invaders. Therefore, after matters settled a bit, they sent a group of their Jaguar Knights to Faerûn to learn more about this new continent. Encouraged by Gar Hollan , a Myratman merchant who gave them transport and promised glorious battle, they went to Tethyr to fight as mercenaries for the Council of Myratma.</p>
<p>By the early 1360s DR, the Jaguar Guard had engaged in several skirmishes in Tethyr, and lost a few of their number. They were expected to grow more active, as either an elite skirmishing unit or as commanders of other companies. Miquiztl hoped to acquire land in Faerûn that they could settle and bring family and allies over from Maztica.</p>
<p>After nearly the entire Council was assassinated by the Four in the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR , as part of the rise to power of Yusuf Jhannivvar , more than half of the Guard were also slain. Their leader, Miquiztl Manik, had his warriors join the Loyalist Army of Zaranda Star . They battled the forces of the Pretender Prince, both by themselves and with the Loyalists.</p>
<p>After the end of the Reclamation Wars in 1369 DR , the Jaguar Guard moved to garrisons around the ancient ruins of Shoonach and helped defend Tethyr against that evil place.</p>
<p>They were still based in Myratma around 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<h3>Membership</h3>
<p>All members were Kultakan nobles, raised as warriors in the elite order of Jaguar Knights, who traditionally led Maztican armies. All were capable warriors and they were led by the talented fighter and tactician Miquiztl Manik .</p>
<h3>Culture</h3>
<p>They formed a brotherhood and remained together as a company. They were honorable, intelligent, followed orders to the letter, and would refuse to commit massacres.</p>
<h3>Relations</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, though they were nobles of Kultaka, they were often treated as ignorant and savage by people of Faerûn. Nevertheless, in the early 1360s, they were too newly arrived to have made enemies in Faerûn, but this was inevitable in Tethyr's civil wars. But ultimately, after the war they were well respected as noble and honorable warriors.</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>As Jaguar Knights, they had various magical powers, such as transforming into jaguars and enchanting their stone weapons with talonblade . They were adept in tactics. They wielded spears , macas , and knives and wore distinctive jaguar-skin armor.</p>
<p>They usually used guerrilla tactics and fought as skirmishers; their ability to change into jaguars aided their stealth and ambush skills. If they fought in a regular battle, they always offered opponents the option to surrender and be taken prisoner, as blend of Maztican and Faerûnian customs.</p>
<h2>Contracts</h2>
<p>The Jaguar Guard had an exclusive contract with the Council of Myratma in the early 1360s DR. They took just about any job that involved combat. They charged 50 gold pieces per week for their services, and also asked for food and lodging and claimed the steel weapons used by those they defeated.</p>
