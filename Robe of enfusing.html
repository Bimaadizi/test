<h2>Powers</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dating to the days of Netheril, wizards favored these robes for their ease of production, sturdiness, light weight, and the ability to hold complicated enchantments fairly easy.</p>
<p>By 1281 DR , robes of enfusing were used by the spell-casters of the Kraken Society who allied themselves with the devil Belhifet , residing within Dorn's Deep . Another robe could be found among treasures within the Dragon's Eye caverns on the Spine of the World . In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , one such robe was worn by a Bane -worshiping bandit, possibly of the Zhentarim , who ambushed traders in the Fallen Crags of Icewind Dale .</p>
