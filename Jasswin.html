<p>Jasswin was a half-elven man who held the post of the Great Druid sometime before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jasswin was, perhaps, the most famous owned of a cloak of the High Forest . When the druid was working towards his accession to the post of the Great Druid, he spent a season in the wilds to "feel the land unhindered" without use of any shelter. When the winter season was approaching, Jasswin found a magic cloak , a gift from the wilds. This gift was humbling to the future Great Druid as it carried a message from nature itself: a man "could appreciate the rain while still seeking shelter from it."</p>
