<p>The Mines of Selgol were found in Samarach on the Chultan Peninsula . The mines were famed for the high quality salt . In Samarach, it was thought to be a great insult to give nobles salts of lesser quality than those from the Mines of Selgol.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The mines were found within the southern arm of the Sanrach Mountains in eastern Samarach due east of Taruin .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>These mines were among the most productive salt mines on the entire Chultan Peninsula. Salt mined here was shipped north and west to the Lake of Steam and the lands around the Shining Sea for centuries.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The mines were first established toward the end of the Shoon Imperium . Deep miners broke through to the Firelands in the Underdark in the Year of Writhing Darkness, 572 DR . This mistake ushered forth centuries of firenewt and salamander marauders overwhelming the mines.</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the firenewt threat returned to the Mines of Selgol with a vengeance. A tribe of firenewt, along with their pet hell hounds , emerged from deep underground and poured into the mines. The raiders were led by the firenewt Overlord Flamespar . The creatures dragged some screaming miners underground while others barely escaped with their lives. The mine's foreman, Essien , perchance, came across a group of mercenaries while drinking his sorrows away at The Broken Pick in Torich . It was unknown if the adventurers agreed to liberate the mines and if they managed to defeat the Overlord, returning the mines to their operational state.</p>
