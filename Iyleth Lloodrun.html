After the scrivener escaped instead of being eliminated, Calivar Murpeth's men captured a woman, the escort Talantha , for questioning. Iyleth was called on to mind ream her, but he found her to be warded. Calivar bade him continue and push forward at all costs. But Talantha was actually the Chosen of Mystra Storm Silverhand in spell-guise; trying to pry into her again caused deadly feedback on him.</p>
