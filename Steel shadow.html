<p>A steel shadow , sometimes just called a shadow , was a rare, metal-animating creature that was very seldom seen in its actual form.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Despite their name, steel shadows were not literally shadow creatures, or even made of steel . Instead, they were named for their ability to enter, and subsequently animate, metal (or alloy) items, such as those made of "steel". When they entered these items, they would bear a "shadow" (a black mark). As steel shadows were usually inside metal objects, they were almost never seen in their natural form.</p>
<p>Their natural form was that of a large planarian worm with two primary feelers that came from their mouths. Their bodies, which could contract, had five barbed barbed tentacles, which they could use to strike. Each of these tentacles was about 6 ft (1.8 m) long.</p>
<p>Such creatures were highly intelligent. When they merged with metal objects, they used them as protective outer coats, as well as a home. They were even able to merge with enchanted armor and weapons .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Steel shadows could strike out with their spiked tentacles, especially if they were found outside of their metal homes. However, when within, they would animate the metal to attack their foes. If their foes broke apart the metal, such as with the disintegrate spell , the shadow was forced out.</p>
<p>They were immune to electrical-based attacks. The heat metal spell healed them instead of damaging them.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>These creatures were usually solitary or formed packs of up to twelve, and could be found almost anywhere that had a presence of metal.</p>
<p>These creatures were very valuable to mages , and as such, were often encountered in mage guilds. Due to the electrical immunity of such creatures, their skin could be used to reduce the damage of electrical-based attacks or spells. Their ichor was also highly prized as an ingredient in spell inks and potions .</p>
<p>The Moonlit Tower of Maerstar was rumored to contain creatures such as steel shadows and watchghosts .</p>
