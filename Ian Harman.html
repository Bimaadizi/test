<p>Ian Harman was a male human of the village of West Harbor on the Sword Coast North in the 1370s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ian was a member of the militia of West Harbor . Strangely, he was usually seen as a coward, who'd rather flee from a fight than join it. The Kalach-Cha considered asking him to join the fight against the bladelings and duergar that invaded in 1374 DR . However, whether he fought or not, Ian was killed in the battle.</p>
