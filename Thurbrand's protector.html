<p>Thurbrand's protector was the battered wooden kite shield of the famous Cormyrian warrior Thurbrand of Arabel .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The +1 protector functioned as a similarly enchanted ring of protection and was impervious to permanent damage, as it magically sealed any cracks or breaks throughout the frame overnight.</p>
<p>Additionally, when the wielder rapped on the frame three times with their fingers or knuckles, the shield produced a bubble of air, 10 feet in radius. This globe moved with the shieldbearer, granting them breathable air within any gases or liquids through which they traveled.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally found within the hoard of a dragon , the protector was wielded for years by Thurbrand. After some time, he sold it to King Osbrun of Tsurlagol within the Vast . Some time around 1351 DR , the shield was looted in a grand theft of the city-state's royal armory. Its whereabouts after that were unknown.</p>
