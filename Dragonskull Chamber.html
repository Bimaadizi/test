<p>The Dragonskull Chamber was a room for spell research in Castle Obarskyr , Suzail .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It was accessible through a side passage of the Haunted Wing .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The double doors were decorated with life-sized dragonskulls made of bronze .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Per Alusair Obarskyr 's ghost , there was an upper treasury in there.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Prior to the Spellplague , it had been used for magical practice.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The wards of the room were especially strong, complex, and indomitable, having grown much more so since the Spellplague; War Wizards were known to suffer ill effects from as much as getting near them. Inside the room, the pressure was perceptible even to those who were not sorcerous.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was said Caladnei had perished there eighty years prior to the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , in approximately 1399Â DR .</p>
<p>Marlin Stormserpent tried to use the room as a landmark while traversing the Haunted Wing of Castle Obarskyr , looking for where the Wyverntongue Chalice was hidden, in the Chamber of the Wyrms Ascending . He was unknowingly tailed by Elminster Aumar , a fugitive wizard, and the ghost of Alusair Obarskyr, who figured out he was looking for somewhere close by.</p>
<p>Later, Ganrahast Aeiulvana discovered there had been some kind of intrusion and laid down orders to block all entrance to the wing. At the same time, Marlin Stormserpent decided to use that room himself, for his own castings. There, he experimented on calling forth blueflame ghosts from their items, and after being satisfied with their functions, sent forth the ghosts Treth Halonter and Relve Langral to kill a rival nobleman, Seszgar Huntcrown .</p>
<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>Among the courtiers of Cormyr , it was said the Wyverntongue Chalice was hidden in or near the Dragonskull Chamber.</p>
