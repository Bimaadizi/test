<p>A ring of warmth was a magical ring that protected its wearer against the effects of extremely cold temperatures.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A creature attuned to and wearing a ring of warmth was not bothered by ambient temperatures as low as −50 ℉ (−46 ℃ ) with no need for cold weather gear or clothing, as a result of the additional body heat magically generated by the ring. In addition, any items carried or worn by the wearer were also immune to those low temperatures. The ring also offered considerable protection against magical cold, greatly reducing any damage taken by the wearer from a cold source.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a ring of warmth dating from the time of the Delzoun dwarves was located in a forgotten chamber of the Vault of Dragons beneath Waterdeep , together with other treasures and dwarven relics.</p>
<h2>Notable Uses</h2>
<p>A pair of rings of warmth were kept in the kitchen of the House of the Moon temple of Selûne in Waterdeep circa 1370 DR . These were used to safely enter the refrigerated pantry, which was kept chilly by a brown mold . One ring was worn by senior priest on duty, the other kept on a hook by the door.</p>
