<p>Targon Hawk was a ranger from the Ama Basin in Kara-Tur , active in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the age of twenty-two, Targon Hawk was an accomplished ranger who traversed the lesser-known part of the Ama Basin. The area's forests grew on the site of the ancient collapsed expanse of mines and hid many untouched treasures. Hawk used his ranger training to track down and recover ancient magical treasures of paying clients. Eventually, one of his clients betrayed the young ranger and had him arrested and convicted to death just to hide the knowledge of the ancient mines from others. Luckily, Targon escaped and, since then, always worked alone and only for himself.</p>
<p>Sometime in the 14 th century DR, Hawk was among the ambitious fortune seekers who were interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed sorceress to retrieve the equally mysterious magical orb from its depths.</p>
