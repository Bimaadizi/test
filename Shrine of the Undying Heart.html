<h2>Location</h2>

<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Originally constructed by residents of Karse , the Shrine of the Undying Heart was made from pink marble that was stained deep crimson. The temple's main circle was supported by 36 pillars, each measuring 10 ft (3 m) in diameter. The main circle had a radius of 100 ft (30 m). The circle's roof was a dome cut from a single piece of rock.</p>
<p>The temple was surrounded by outlying buildings during ages past, but had long since disappeared as of 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>A statue depicting a lifelike human heart was found at the center of the temple, beating in tune with Karsus' heart while he was alive. A sheen of continuously swirling blood covered the beating statue. The Heartblood River derived its name from the fact that the blood from the statue eventually flowed down the butte to mingle with the river.</p>
