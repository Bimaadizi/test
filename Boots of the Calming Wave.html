<h2>Powers</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Order of the Calming Wave was founded by a group of ex-pirates after they survived a particularly dangerous storm while in the sea. The pirate ship's cleric claimed the storm was Umberlee 's wrath and only Valkur looked at them favorably. The survivors of the storm, by Valkur's blessing, decided to abandon their pirating ways and devoted themselves to the Captain of the Waves' religion, promoting his will.</p>
<p>After the Wailing Death of 1372 DR , these boots could be found in places along the Sword Coast and islands of the Sea of Swords frequented by pirates and sailors.</p>
