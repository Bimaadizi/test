<p>Iris agate was a low-grade agate that came in large pieces, usually used as a building material.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Iris agate looked white in normal lighting conditions, but when cut into thin slabs and illuminated from behind, its swirling mix of colors was strikingly visible.

<h2>Powers</h2>

<h2>Notable Uses</h2>
<p>Iris agate was one of the components of the talismans of spell turning created by the orcs of the Thousand Fists tribe and used by the Nethertide Horde in the Battle of Turnstone Pass against the Moonlight Men .</p>
