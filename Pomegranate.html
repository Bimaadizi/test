<p>Pomegranates , or, araed ( sing & pl ), as they were known in Faer√ªn , were fruit-bearing trees, commonly grown in the wild and sometimes cultivated in the lands south of the Sword Coast .</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Pomegranates were occasionally imported from the southern regions (excluding Shar ) to the Eastern and Western Heartlands as well as Sword Coast North . These shipments were often merely an afterthought, when trade ships had a bit of extra space. Pomegranates were considered cheap fruit as it grew almost everywhere in the south in the wild.</p>
<p>In the City of Splendors, Waterdeep , Khelben Arunsun had an ensorcelled kitchen cupboard within the Blackstaff Tower that, when opened, brought forth an overbearing pomegranate tree, especially favored by Danilo Thann in his childhood. Lady Laeral Silverhand also liked to imbibe a glass or two of refreshing pomegranate nectar.</p>
<p>Pomegranates were consumed raw by the inhabitants of Anauroch .</p>
<p>In Zakhara , pomegranate, coconut palms , banana , orange , lemon , plum , and fig trees were cultivated and often housed ashira , benevolent tree spirits. Notably, Mosque of a Thousand Hummingbirds in Dihliz was filled with blooming and pomegranate-bearing trees. The Pearl Cities , wealthy Zakharan port cities, cultivated many legumes, fruits, and vegetables, inclusion pomegranates.</p>
<p>Outside of the Prime Material plane , pomegranates could be found in the Feywild . Archfey Neifion served these crimson fruits in his Darroch Castle in 1396 DR .</p>
