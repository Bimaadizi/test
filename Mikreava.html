<p>Mikreava was a sentinel gargoyle in service to the Sardonyx Knights of Grumbar who rebelled against its handlers in 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mikreava arrived in the Undermountain temple of the dead deity Myrkul alongside the Sardonyx Knights of Grumbar in their attempt to take over and claim the worship site as their own in 1370 DR . During that time, Mikreava decided against following the Knights and Grumbar and became more interested in consuming humanoid flesh. The gargoyle fled and made a lair in the bedchambers of the former High Priest of Myrkul. Subsequently, an agent of Khelben Arunsun arrived at the temple in search of the well-hidden Black Wand of Myrkul . There he met Chasbar , a member of the Sardonyx Knights of Grumbar. Eventually, both Mikreava and Chasbar asked the adventurer to slay one another. Regardless of the hero's decision, the gargoyle's patience ran thin and it decided to find out how the adventurer tasted.</p>
