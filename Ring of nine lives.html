<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was an ivory ring with the face of a snarling cat .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>If the wearer was beaten unconscious or left dying, one of the ring's "lives" would be used automatically to cast a heal spell on the wearer. Also, if the wearer needed extremely quick reflexes, strong willpower, or extreme fortitude, he or she could instead use one of the "lives" for this purpose.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Creation of a such a ring required the heal and limited wish spells .</p>
<h2>Cost</h2>
<p>One of these rings was worth around 70,000 gold pieces if all "lives" were intact, but usually these rings were found with some of the "lives" used up.</p>
