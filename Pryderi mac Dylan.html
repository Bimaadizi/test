<p>Pryderi mac Dylan was a shield dwarf man of the dwarven city of Earthfast of the Earthfast Mountains of north Faerûn , in the Earthroot region of the Underdark</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Pryderi was the son of Dylan .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , Pryderi was one of the 2000 Earthfast dwarves led by Ironlord Torg mac Cei who joined the Army of the Alliance against the Tuigan Horde .</p>
<p>As the dwarves camped south of Uthmerg in the Great Dale , Pryderi was one of the sentries. He and another dwarf caught two apparent intruders teleporting in just outside—King Azoun IV of Cormyr , leader of the Army, and his Court Wizard Vangerdahast —and held them at crossbow -point. Ironlord Torg arrived and berated Pryderi and his fellow sentry for failing to recognize a king.</p>
<p>It transpired that the dwarven escort sent to meet Azoun and Vangerdahast had disappeared, and Torg ordered Pryderi to lead a patrol to find them. The patrol found the escort killed by orcs . Later, joined by Vangerdahast, they discovered two orcish scouts. Vangerdahast hypnotized one, but when the spell was disrupted, Pryderi shot the orc before he could draw a sword on the wizard. Upon the patrol's return late at night, Pryderi delivered his findings to Torg. Afterwards, he returned to guard duty.</p>
