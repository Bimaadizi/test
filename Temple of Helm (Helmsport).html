<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in Helmsport's early years, the settlement became the target of attacks by the red wolves of Payit . These cunning beasts took the lives of a dozen builders among those who worked on the Temple of Helm, before the colonial authorities assembled a group of hunters to kill the pack's alpha. The hunt was successful, and the aptly named leader of the attacks, the Red Wolf of Payit, was taxidermied and proudly displayed in the finished temple. The stuffed beast caused an uproar among the Payitlans , who thought it disrespectful to the killed creature. Soon after, a chain of maladies afflicted the temple's inhabitants, leading the Payit folk to whisper of the Red Wolf's angry spirit punishing its killers. Helmites and settlers considered it to be nothing but superstition. Their opinions started to waver after the temple's High Priest perished of a heartstop right by the display of the stuffed wolf. After some unrest, the stuffed animal was removed and sent to Amn to calm the superstitious.</p>
