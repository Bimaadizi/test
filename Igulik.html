<p>Igulik was a legendary mighty hero from Rashemen who once famously wielded a powerful artifact , the Sea Reaver , in a battle to save the tribes of his country long before the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>If the legends were to be believed, Igulik received aid when he visited Lake Ashane , where a great water spirit blessed him and gifted him the Sea Reaver scythe , a powerful magical weapon that possessed enchantments deadly to elemental creatures. With the scythe in hand, Igulik confronted an evil wizard , who brought an army of elementals to enslave the tribes of Rashemen. As per tradition in the Rashemaar legends, Igulik was triumphant, but died after ending the evil wizard's life. After his death, the Sea Reaver returned to Lake Ashane, where it waited for a new hero to wield it against the foes of Rashemen.</p>
