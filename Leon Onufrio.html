<p>Leon Onufrio was one of the favorite "children" of the vampire lord Cazador Szarr , and ther father to Victoria Onufrio , who resided in the Szarr Palace of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Leon was a human man with a light skin tone, glowing sinister red eyes of a bloodsucker, and long, straight, light brown hair streaked with white and red. Like his vampiric "siblings," Leon's back was carved with scars in the shape of internal runes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Leon Onufrio was one of the youngest vampire spawns sired by Cazador Szarr, who, before being turned, was a sorcerrer . His still mortal human daughter, Victoria Onufrio, was still a child in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , when Leon was commanded to bring her to reside in the Szarr Palace. Her well-being was one of the tools to ensure Leon's position as Cazador's favored spawn – the status that allowed the human child protection from other vampires. Eventually, Victoria attracted the attention of Violet and Dalyria , fellow vampire spawn and "sisters" of Leon's. Dalyria became obsessed with curing vampirism , believing it to be nothing more than a disease of the blood. She developed a theory that the cure was hidden in a great amount of blood from a young and strong individual, one strong enough to overwhelm vampirism. She targeted the "pureblooded" Victoria. Unbeknownst to Dalyria, Victoria had a powerful curse placed on her by Leon Onufrio as protection.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, a life in a gothic vampire castle only resulted in the child's death. Leon was trying to acquire a quality disguise from Figaro Pennygood of Facemaker's Boutique in the Lower City , to smuggle her out of the vampire lord's domain when it became known that Cazador was planning to perform a ritual that, allegedly, would help all his children "cheat death." Leon also gave his daughter a copy of Kozakuran Dictionary , so Victoria could learn the words of Kazador's magic that sealed the palace and allowed her to escape if needed. But she was found out and returned to the palace by Dalyria. When Dalyria attempted to drain the child, the wasting curse activated. Dalyria was found puking the cursed blood when Cazador discovered her plan and dragged her away to be punished. The child's body was left in Leon Onufrio's chambers, radiating waves of deadly sapping necrotic magic.</p>
<p>Like his siblings, the purpose of Leon's existence was a powerful ritual to be performed by Cazador Szarr in 1492 DR . As a result, the vampire spawns were to be destroyed, and their power would transform Cazador into a vampire ascendant. It was unknown if the ritual was successful and Leon was destroyed, or if the ritual never was completed, leaving Leon freed from his dark master to mourn Victoria in peace, or if Leon was slain as the wayward "brother," Astarion Ancunín ended his old torturer's unlife.</p>
