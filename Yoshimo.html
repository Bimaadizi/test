<h2>Activities</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Not much is known about Yoshimo's origins save for the fact he came from the empire of Shou Lung .</p>
<p>At some point he had come into the debt of Renal Bloodscalp for infringing upon their operations.</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Yoshimo was in the service of the mage Jon Irenicus , compelled to do his bidding under pain of a geas .</p>
<p>When the Hero of Baldur's Gate escaped from Irenicus' imprisonment in Mirtul of that year, Yoshimo posed as a fellow escaped prisoner to gain his trust and track his movements in the city of Athkatla .</p>
<p>Some time later the hero broke into the asylum of Spellhold to confront Irenicus and rescue their sibling Imoen . Yoshimo revealed his treachery and raised his weapon against him, seeking to die in battle rather than by the agony of a broken geas . He attained a death that could not be reversed, even by the power of a celestial Solar .</p>
