<p>Rings of water walking were magical rings that allowed one to walk upon the surface of water.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Most of these rings were set with an opal . To those able to detect magical auras , the ring gave off a moderately strong aura of transmutation magic.</p>
<p>Rings of water walking sold for about 15,000 gold pieces in most economies.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Not surprisingly, wearing this ring was exactly the same as if one were under the effects of a water walk spell, except that the power to walk on water lasted for as long as the ring was worn. Despite the ring's name, other liquids besides water could be walked upon, including flowing liquids and even frozen liquids like snow or ice or molten solids like magma. This was because wearing the ring caused one's feet to hover an inch or so above the surface of the liquid.</p>
<p>Putting on the ring while submerged would magically rush the wearer to the surface at the speed of an average jog.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>To forge a ring of water walking , a spellcaster needed to be able to cast the water walk spell.</p>
