<h2>History</h2>
<p>Garadic was serving Ilhundyl in Year of the Leaping Centaur, 232 DR , when Ilhundyl was visited at the Castle of Sorcery by Elmara , a priestess of Mystra looking to become a wizard . After she caught his interest, he called on Garadic to bring her to his presence. There, Ilhundyl bade her deliver Ondil's Book of Spells to Mystra's Dance , a shrine. He admitted to Garadic afterwards that he meant for her to die, for he'd spotted the most potential for magic out of any individual he'd ever met.</p>
<p>Once she acquired the book on the Year of Much Ale, 233 DR and travelled to Mystra's Dance, Garadic was there, disguised as the boat ferryman that took her there. He was also present later back in the Castle when Ilhundyl attempted to read Ondil's Book of Spells. The emptiness of the book and the taunts of the Magister Dorgon Heamiiolothtar whom he farspoke afterwards drove him into a rage, in which he hurled spells that slew Garadic.</p>
