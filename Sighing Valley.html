<p>The Sighing Valley was a canyon that ran through the southern stretch of the Sumber Hills in the Dessarin Valley . It earned its name from the whipping winds that created a sighing sound as they passed by the canyon's features.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>The Sighing Valley comprised a wide canyon floor dotted with a number of tors, rocky spires, and mesas. Winding between these features was a rather small waterway known as the Lost River.</p>
<p>One of the more notable features of the Sighing Valley was Feathergale Spire , a tower that served as the headquarters of the Waterdhavian Feathergale Knights in the late 15 th century.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The canyon was home to a couple of semi-intelligent races, gnolls and aarakocra . Other creatures that dwelt within were goats , hyenas , blood hawks , and other aerial beasts such as giant vultures , griffons , and manticores .</p>
