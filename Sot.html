<p>Sot was the not so famous innkeeper of the Laughing Goblin Inn though his pork and cabbage soup was renowned throughout Phlan .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1290 DR , Sot's grandfather was a cleric of Tyr and guardsman at Sokol Keep on Thorn Island . In 1340 DR , gave his grandfather's holy symbol of Tyr to Tarl Desanea , which was similar to Tarl's own holy symbol but had different writing on it.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Though odd for some, Sot collected rare glass liquor bottles and he displayed these treasures behind his bar.</p>
<h2>Equipment</h2>
<p>Sot's weapon of choice for use at the inn and adjoining tavern was a large cudgel, which was basically a club or short staff . He and the cook would always reach instinctively for their cudgels when trouble was brewing at the inn.</p>
