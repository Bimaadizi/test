<p>Gentleman's Groggery , also known as Double G , was a tavern in the Central Port of Skullport in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Gentleman's Groggery was a one-story building in fair condition. It was located atop a flattened stone column accessible by a catwalk.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Two features characterized the Gentleman's Groggery. The first was the presence of a colony of approximately 3,000 bats roosting overhead and beneath the eaves.</p>
<p>The second was the fact that the tavern was located within a permanent dead magic zone that extended 20 feet (6.1 meters) from the structure. This anomaly originated during the Time of Troubles and persisted ever since.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The food at the tavern was reasonably priced and of generally good quality. However, the selection of ales and beers was both limited and expensive, a consequence of Wurlitzer's unresolved dispute with the dwarf brewer Gyudd . As a result, alcoholic beverages was procured from visiting merchants, resulting in higher costs and lower overall quality.</p>
<p>The owner of the tavern was known for his culinary experimentation and paid well, up to 100 gp , for novel recipes from other regions. The menu included dishes such as deep-fried stirges served in a light herb sauce, priced at three silver pieces for two servings.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Gentleman's Groggery was owned by Wurlitzer . Wurlitzer's assistant, Oslo , was frequently occupied with clearing bats from the taproom and removing accumulated guano from the tavern's exterior surfaces.</p>
