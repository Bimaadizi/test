<p>The Delimbiyr Vale , also known as the Shining Valley , was an area in the North , encompassing the western, upper reaches of the Delimbiyr River . The vale was a nigh-endless stretch of sweeping valley that attracted travelers and settlers who could brave life in the Savage Frontier . However, parts of it were forsaken, filled with falling ruins, monsters, and ancient secrets.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Vale was bound on the north by the Nether Mountains and to the south by the South Wood . Its western edge was the High Forest but no part of the High Forest was considered a part of the Vale. Despite this, the High Forest in the south ran almost to the banks of the Delimbiyr, narrowing the Vale considerably.</p>
<p>Two areas of the Delimbiyr Vale were often referred to as Upvale and Gray Vale by the locals. Upvale was an area of open grasslands in the northern Delimbiyr Vale between Tall Trees and the Far Forest . Gray Vale was in the southwest and consisted of the area of grasslands through which the rivers Greyflow and Loagrann flowed.</p>
<p>The lower Delimbiyr had floodplains, situated around Daggerford.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The ancient elven realm of Eaerlann once held much of the upper Delimbiyr Vale, with its western border lying 100 mi (160 km) west of the River Delimbiyr. They established a great fortress at the head of the valley; called Ascalhorn, it became Hellgate Keep.</p>
<p>The Barony of Steeping Falls was formed on the northern back of the Delimbiyr River, in the Year of the Arduous Journey, 133 DR , by the vampire Artor Morlin . It stood for almost three centuries before dissolving.</p>
<p>A half-century later, in the Year of the Murmuring Dead, 183 DR , the kingdom of Athalantar was founded by the Stag King, Uthgrael Aumar . The king and his son both oversaw the realm for some time, before it was taken over by the powerful magelords . The Kingdom of the Stag was freed from their unjust rule by the Chosen of Mystra Elminster Aumar and saw prosperity for over a century. Unfortunately, Athalantar was wiped out by a horde of marauding orcs in the Year of the Cantobele Stalking, 342 DR .</p>
<p>For hundreds of years, the demonic forces of Hellgate Keep controlled a stretch of the Delimbiyr Vale, but the fall of that ancient citadel in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR put an end to its authority in the region.</p>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , a shocking incident known as the Fendrell Massacre took place in the Delimbiyr Vale, some time before Shieldmeet . Nothing whatsoever is known about this incident, however numerous speculations existed about its gruesome nature.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In the mid-to-late 1300s DR, lightfoot halflings had settlements along the banks of the lower Delimbiyr, with the greatest concentration around Secomber. Tieflings , the progeny of the demons of Hellgate Keep, were found the upper Delimbiyr Vale.</p>
<p>However, circa 1372 DR, few seemed to be interested in founding a settlement in the region of the vale near the Silver Marches as it was a desolate region.</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, many settlers of the North were attracted to the lands of the Delimbiyr Vale.</p>
<p>Beyond the civilized folk, the vale was home to monsters and monstrous humanoids , such as hobgoblins and bugbears . Travel through Gray Vale was often dangerous due to bugbear raids.</p>
<p>In the Underdark caverns beneath this wild land dwelt a demonic general known as Kaanyr Vhok , the Sceptered One, who had amassed an army of tanarukks and fiendish beasts.</p>
