<p>Ragrath Deathclaw was a cleric of Gruumsh for the Ripped Gut tribe of orcs of Baraskur during the 14 th century DR .</p>
<p>Although his father Arlagh was the clan's chieftain, Ragrath was more influenced by another follower of the "One-Eyed God", Orauth Skullstone . In fact, the younger Deathclaw was so swayed by Skullstone and his ideology, that he planned to betray his father in the name of Gruumsh.</p>
