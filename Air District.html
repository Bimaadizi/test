<p>The Air District was a collection of 36 earthmotes that became a prestigious neighborhood of Yhaunn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the Spellplague struck in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , the surrounding cliffs and slopes of the city shattered and broke away, falling upwards into the sky along with the wreckage of the upper-class mansions that had been built on them. Nearly ten thousand people died in the event, though the city eventually recovered with the assistance of their Shadovar masters. The earthmotes were eventually inhabited and became the Air District, home of luxurious mansions, with the highest earthmotes having the most prestige.</p>
