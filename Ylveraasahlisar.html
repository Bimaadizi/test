<p>Ylveraasahlisar , also known as the Rose Dragon , was an infamous red dragon that ruled Calimshan for more than a century.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ylveraasahlisar was a great wyrm who laired in the Cloud Peaks . In −1838 DR , a group of Calishite adventurers crept into her lair to steal some of her treasure hoard, killing one of her brood in the process.</p>
<p>After this incident, an enraged Ylveraasahlisar attacked Calimport , destroying two-thirds of the city including the Caleph's Court and the Raor bakkal , along with most of Calimshan's army. After the bloodbath, she seized the throne and her first edict was to reconstruct all she had destroyed. In a hurry to comply, her terrified subjects merely leveled the rubble enough to support new construction and began anew, thus creating much of the Muzad .</p>
<p>Ylveraasahlisar ruled until −1726 DR when Rafak el Cajaan organized her demise. He gathered a group of dragonslayers, including a bronze dragon named Cadasalmpar , that attacked the Rose Dragon by surprise in her court. After a fierce battle, she escaped from Calimport gravely wounded. Cadasalmpar tracked her down and administered the killing bite.</p>
