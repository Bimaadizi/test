<p>Orva was an ancient human kingdom located in what would later become Cormyr . Orva was destroyed around −702 DR , in "one horrific night of blood and slime" when it was subsumed by the Vast Swamp .</p>
<h2>Locations</h2>
<p>Much of Orva was located in what would become the Vast Swamp, which expanded greatly during the disaster. The capital of the realm was sunk beneath the southern edge of the Swamp, while Orvaskyte Keep sat ruined in the heart of the Swamp.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Orva used the Thorass language and had its own dating system, with some documents making reference to the Mulhorandi Calendar .</p>
<p>The patron deity of Orva was a human aspect of Labelas Enoreth called Chronos .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Orva's extent covered part of what would become eastern Cormyr, and the Vast Swamp was much smaller and more natural environment. Its last king was a power-hungry tyrant with delusions of grandiosity, who commanded his mages to devise a means of expanding Orva's borders and securing the realm. In their rush to please their king and avoid execution they opened a planar gate at Orvaskyte Keep to Minauros , the Baatorian plane of greed and sinking swamps.</p>
<p>A massive explosion killed most of the archmages present, followed by a great wind that pulled the survivors and the newly-arrived priests into Minauros. Then, a torrent of hellish slime and ooze burst from the portal, washing over the land and expanding the Vast Swamp massively. In the process, the realm of Orva was destroyed and replaced with a nightmarish mire filled with Hell-spawned diseases and monstrosities.</p>
<p>Although the gateway closed, the barrier between planes remained thin ever after and allowed temporary portals to Minauros to open and deposit more foul creatures in the ruins of Orvaskyte Keep.</p>
<p>By the time of the foundation of Cormyr in 26 DR , Orva was long forgotten. The few scattered ruins that remained were inhabited by swamp-dwelling creatures, which were sometimes delved by daring adventurers seeking ancient treasure.</p>
