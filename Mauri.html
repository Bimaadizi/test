<h2>History</h2>
<p>By 228 DR , Mauri had made friends with Eladar, a local bandit who was secretly Prince Elminster Aumar , whom she'd told tales of the dwarves who'd made Lawless Castle , where the Knights of Athalantar , turned to banditry in response to the rule of Belaur Aumar and his Magelords of Athalantar , had taken refuge. After a foray where a team led by Sargeth managed to slay six armsmen, Mauri's inventory of foodstuffs was limited to just a few potatoes.</p>
<p>After the entrance to Lawless Castle was discovered by a patrol, Mauri was one of the ones not ordered to the front line by Sargeth. She took stock of who had died in the aftermath of the fight, reporting to Helm Stoneblade afterwards that she found not Eladar the Dark.</p>
<p>She later arrived at Woodsedge Inn , with a sleigh; the innskeeper Broarn told Helm to order her to remain there at the inn.</p>
