<p>Jutta was a young apprentice to Maligor , the Zulkir of Alteration in Thay in midâ€“14 th century DR.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Jutta was a young, short, and stocky girl with a clean-shaven head. Maligor thought her round face to look like an overripe cantaloupe. Like her master, she was a worshiper of Myrkul , which was evident from a holy symbol of the god tattooed on her head. She often wore rose-scented perfumes.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>As an apprentice, she was respectful and subservient to Maligor. She was one of the most adept pupils that Maligor ever had. He respected her ruthlessness and intelligence, qualities valued in Thay.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Intelligence and ambition were her main weapons, along with a selection of spells taught to her by Maligor. He awarded her magic lessons for well-completed tasks.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Jutta was in possession of her master's ring of flying .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She respected her master and was eager to please Maligor as a teacher and he, in turn, respected her, planning on replacing his assistant Asp with Jutta once he got bored of her. Asp , a spirit naga lieutenant, was jealous of his interest in the young apprentice.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jutta came to Maligor's service in 1361 DR . To guarantee her loyalty, Maligor abducted her parents and put them to work in the slave citrus plantations. If Jutta were to displease him, their deaths would be terrible.</p>
<p>In 1362 DR , she was tasked with scattering the remains of Willeth Lionson along the First Escarpment , making sure none of Maligor's enemies would be able to commune with the dead man and discover the Zulkir's plans.</p>
