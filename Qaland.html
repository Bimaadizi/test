<p>The Qaland or Qajand family was the reigning dynasty of the Igidujin tribe and the city of Quaraqand in the Chigidi Mountains in the Plain of Horses .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The pitiless Qaland Shurijah united the hsing (clans) of the Chigidi Mountains , after almost a century of deadly warring with one another, and forged the Igidujin tribe. The Qaland family ruled the Igidujin ever since.</p>
<p>Circa Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) , Shurijah's descendant, Qaland T'akk , reigned over the Igidujin and the city of Quaraqand . He was a man without mercy and bent on conquest.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Their reign was a cruel and despotic one. Under the vicious law of the Qalands, thieves and protestors were executed, no trial necessary. However, the most common crime in Quaraqand was apparently treason, and resulted in the alleged traitor, their family, and even their livestock all being slain. Furthermore, Qaland T'akk forced those who served him to kill enemies according to weekly quotas. Failure to kill enough was of course punished by execution, by T'akk himself.</p>
