<p>Chasper's Trading Tower was a shop in Scornubel during the 14 th century DR that was taken over by drow infiltrators.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The outer doors opened into a lobby, from which double doors allowed entry into the shop proper. There was also an office in the back.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Wares for sale lined not only shelves, but many massive ones hung from rafters. The place was described as labyrinthine.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The place carried sundries of all sorts, including objects such as wagon wheels, coach-harnesses, and armor.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>There were hired doorswords, and a poisoned seat cushion in a backroom office.</p>
<h2>Staff</h2>
<p>The owner circa 1369 DR was a drow infiltrator who gave her name as Yamaerthe when dealing with other drow.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , they were visited by a drow trader named "Iylinvyx" (actually a disguise of Dove Falconhand ). She wanted to trade glowcap mushrooms and deep wines for some sundries; she was told by the shopkeepers that they didn't trade in bulk, but to seek Sarltan instead. Then they directed her to the owner in the back; there, she was met by an older-looking woman who admitted they were forbidden to reveal their true nature, all but confirming they were drow infiltrators. Giving her name for reference as "Yamaerthe", she directed Iylinvyx to seek Daeraude at Blackmanacles .</p>
