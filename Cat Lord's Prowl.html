<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Cat Lord's Prowl's location was not a static location, but rather defined as the area around the cat lord's pride. One cat lord always picked out a misty copse near a water source somewhere within the Prowl as shelter for herself and the pride.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Where one cat lord preferred Brux , a number of them mainly roamed Krigala , or anywhere in the three layers of the Beastlands .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The cat lord's pride consisted of all manner of cats, such as cheetahs , jaguars , spotted lions , mountain lions , tigers , smilodons , elven cats , leopards , and winged cats .</p>
<p>Besides the cat lord, the lesser deity of weretigers , Ferrix , also ran with the cat lord's pride, usually in the form of a tigress. Her petitioners , in the form of weretigers and werejaguars , could in turn also be found in the Prowl.</p>
