<p>The Akanamere was a large freshwater lake, located in the Akanal peninsula, nestled between the Akanapeaks to the north and the Maerthwatch to the south. The collection of city-states known as the Blade Kingdoms sat on the lake's north-western shores.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Akanamere was a lake rich with fish, while its shores were some of the richest farmlands in Faerûn . To the south-east, between the Akanamere and the Adder River laid the low but mineral-rich Hills of Maerth . Apart from the Blade Kingdoms, the shores of the great lake were home to two small trading villages of Oslin and Maerduuth on the Akanamere's southeastern shores. A small town of Rodanar - on the northern bank. River Akax connected the Akanamere to the Bay of Chessenta and offered a waterway navigatable by small and medium-sized naval vessels.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>A kingdom of nixies could be found underneath the waters of the Akanamere. The peaceful creatures engaged in trade with the humans of the Blade Kingdoms and were allied with them during the reign of Princess Krrrr-poka . Nixie political dignitaries were guests during the annual celebration of the Festival of Blades . Nixies of Krrrr-poka's kingdom aided fishing city-states of Zutria and Lomatra by driving schools of fish into fishing nets and guarding them against hungry pikes , common within the lake. Nixies received dried beef and squeeze bulbs filled with wine in exchange.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The Akanamere produced a rich catch of fish to the cities on its shores and the nixie population that dwelt in its waters. Eels , stone crabs , and druth were the most common catch. Fresh fish was often sun-dried for storage or trade, and crab was stored in salt -filled barrels . Dried fish was often used in stews and soups, shredded, and cooked in water. The Akanamere's eels were known for their nutty flavor, while flatfish had a distinct smoky taste that resembled pig bacon . Among other fish that was fished from the lake and traded by nixies were blowfish , hogfish , and singing fish .</p>
<p>Apart from fish, the Akanamere served as the main source of freshwater for the western part of the nation of Chessenta .</p>
<p>While the underwater inhabitants of the Akanamere traded with surface dwellers, the humanoids who inhabited the lake's shores used its waters for trade. The waters of the Akanamere held numerous trade sea routes between the local cities, as well as ships that traveled from afar via River Akax and the Bay of Chessenta.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Shortly before the opening of the Orcgate , in -1076 DR , a wizard Shan the Golden of the Great Rift , discovered an ancient tomb underneath the waters of the Akanamere. There, Shan discovered the artifact known as the Sunphelm of Shandaular .</p>
<p>A conflict consumed the Blade Kingdoms in the Year of the Falling Moon, 1217 DR and lasted until the Year of the Swimming Cats, 1218 DR . The north-western shores of the Akanamere were lit ablaze by mercenary armies of Ugo Svarézi . The war badly damaged the city of Sumbria , Kirenzia was torched and almost completely destroyed, while Zutria was attacked and conquered. The grand battle that concluded the Blade Wars took place at the gates of Lomatra . Nixies of Princess Krrrr-poka's kingdom joined the fray against an overwhelming force. Despite all odds, Lomatra defeated the invading armies and Ugo Svarézi – killed, further solidifying the relationship between the Blade Kingdoms and nixies of the Akanamere.</p>
<p>Circa the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the eastern shores of the Akanamere became a field of battle between Cimbar and Akana . The conflict lasted for several months until the was moved south, further into Chessenta .</p>
<p>The late 14 th century DR brought a number of raids by troglodyte tribes of Traaskl Thorog , led by Drukkul . Traaskl Thorog, or Middle Darklands of the Underdark located underneath Chessenta, was the origin of the strategic raids. Troglodyte of Chief Drukkul attacked lands between the Akanamere to the River Adder , never striking the same area more than once per year.</p>
<p>In the calamity of the Spellplague that ravaged Toril in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , the majority of the Akanamere was drained, turning the once-great lake into a shadow of its former self. The receding waters left the land to be reclaimed by wilderness. Its shores lost the nations that once stood there and were replaced with Akanûl , pulled by the calamity from the world of Abeir .</p>
<p>With Spellplague's end and the goddess of magic Mystra 's return that started in the Year of the Narthex Murders, 1482 DR , the lands of Vilhon Reach were returned to Toril and the Akanamere reclaimed its waters, returning to its former size.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Apart from a nixie kingdom, the waters of the Akanamere were inhabited by vodyanoi and lizardfolk tribes dotted the lake's shoers, as well as cities of the Blade Kingdoms and Chessenta. An occasional privateer ship can be seen sailing across the lake. Mudmen were reported seen in the Akanamere, brought to life by a magical flow of water that originated somewhere within the lake.</p>
<p>The northern shores often saw orcish raids on cattle and sheep herders; however, they did not engage with human settlements. However, many peaceful members of the Flaming Spike tribe moved to Airspur and set to pursue mercantile careers.</p>
