<p>Ninthalor's harp was a magical harp used by the Harpers .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When played, Ninthalor's harp provided the player and their belongings with the effects of stoneskin , making even fragile items highly resistant to physical damage. Other creatures were not affected by this ability, even if they come into contact with the harpist.</p>
<p>Furthermore, an invisible, protective force field surrounded the harp and the player's arms, making it extremely difficult for others to physically interfere with the harpist's playing. However, this field did not protect against magical attacks and could be instantly ended by a silence spell with a radius of 15 feet (4.6 meters) or a hold person spell cast on the harpist.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ninthalor's harp originated from the ancient city of Myth Drannor .</p>
