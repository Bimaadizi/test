<p>Azariah Craulnober (pronounced ah-ZAH-ree-ah ) was the daughter of Elaith Craulnober , a moon elf crime lord of Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Azariah had silvery hair. In the summer of 1364 DR , her ears were still soft and folded, like those of all elven toddlers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Azariah was an unexpected child, born in Waterdeep in the spring of 1363 DR to Elaith's sun elven mistress, who died in childbirth. After her birth, Elaith took her to Evindal Duirsar , the patriarch priest of Corellon Larethian in Waterdeep. Elaith wished for Azariah to receive her birthright, Elaith's dormant moonblade , so Evindal tasked him with retrieving the Morninglark harp, with the hope that the quest would restore Elaith's honor and allow the reactivation of the moonblade.</p>
<p>Elaith, with the help of Danilo Thann and company, found the harp in the summer of 1364 DR , but after Danilo used it to reverse a curse, the harp was consumed and Elaith could not complete his task. However, in the process of defending Danilo, he was badly injured and his thoughts turned only to his daughter. His moonblade, sensing his change of character, reactivated itself so that Azariah would be able to inherit it.</p>
<p>After Elaith healed from his injuries, he took Azariah to Evermeet , where she became a ward of the royal court.</p>
<p>When Azariah was old enough, Elaith brought her to Waterdeep and asked Arilyn Moonblade to train her and teach her the demands of bearing a moonblade. Unknown to both Azariah and Elaith, Azariah had a half-brother, a child of Elaith and Amnestria Moonflower , who may in fact be the heir to the Craulnober moonblade.</p>
