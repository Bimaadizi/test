<p>Loki was an old gluttonous tomcat that belonged to Firtha Kerdos of Targos in Icewind Dale in the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Loki was one of the many cats that lived with the elderly foul-tempered blind woman Firtha Kerdos in the dock district of the town of Targos. Shortly before the town became menaced by goblin raids orchestrated by the Legion of the Chimera , circa Tarsakh of the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , Loki went missing. The tomcat had made his way into one of the warehouses of the Gallaway Trading Coster where he went hunting for mice. The cat consumed over a dozen rodents, twice his weight, and died of overeating. According to his mistress Firtha, he died happy.</p>
