<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Randalf was a handsome, polite, and well-dressed pale-skinned blond halfling with blue eyes. He wore a quality leather jerkin, a leather circlet, and simple muddy-green breeches.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the army assembled by the Cult of the Absolute moved from the Moonrise Towers in Chionthar Valley to menace the city of Baldur's Gate , displacing countless refugees in the process along the way. However, Sylvie Summerworth was not particularly frightened by the encroaching army. Instead of being worried about the looming doom to the city of Baldur's Gate, Randalf and his friend Sylvie Summerworth stressed over undelivered pigeon mail. Randalf attended to Sylvie as she raged over Sword Coast Courier pigeon mail and suggested others to hold on to the mail until the situation was resolved. Unbeknownst to most, the pigeons were hunted and eaten by Gale Dekarios 's tressym named Tara , who recently followed her master to Baldur's Gate from Waterdeep .</p>
