<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ilych was the chief of the duergar slaves in the dungeon deep underneath the city of Athkatla in Amn . He and his men served Jon Irenicus and worked in the dungeon's smithy, forging knives and tools for torture. The duergar held the acorns of the Fairy Queen of the Windspear Hills , the only chance for freedom a group of dryads enslaved by the evil had. Ulene , Elyme , and Cania could escape by passing through a newly grown oak tree if the acorns of the dryads' tree were returned to the Fairy Queen. When Abdel Adrian approached the smithy, Ilyich and his fellow duergar attacked. The scuttle resulted in Ilyich's demise.</p>
