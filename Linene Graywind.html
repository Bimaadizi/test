<p>Linene Graywind was the master of the Lionshield Coster trading post in Phandalin in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was described to be sharp-tongued. She worked tirelessly to keep her business running smoothly regardless of whether times were good or bad, and was grateful to anyone that could aid her in times of need. She was a reliable source for gossip.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Graywind was a representative of the Lionshield Coster , a Yartar -based merchant organization. She traded in a wide variety of supplies, and the Lionshield Coster was the main place to buy finished goods and horses in Phandalin. Linene did not deal in illicit goods, and was willing to sell weapons and armor only to those whom she felt would not threaten the village of Phandalin. If her store did not carry a piece of equipment, she could place a special order to have it delivered within a few days, a service for which she required the customer to pay a deposit.</p>
<p>She lived in a small house just west of her business.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Linene had a daughter, Minghee Graywind , about whom she was prone to worry but tried to be supportive.</p>
<p>She was friends with Alaestra Ulgar , a colleague who managed the Lion's Share in Triboar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1491 DR , Linene expected a large shipment of goods from Yartar, but they never arrived. The caravan transporting the weapons and armor was raided by Cragmaw tribe goblins , and was taken to their base .</p>
<p>She refused to do business with the Redbrands , a local bandit group, and advised adventurers to stay away from the Sleeping Giant , where the ruffians drank.</p>
<p>Following the attacks by the white dragon Cryovain in the surrounding region, Linene hired on Velleen Firecrow as a new assistant and courier. Velleen and her cadre of adoring kobolds turned out to be spies for the evil Cult of Talos .</p>
<p>In 1496 DR , Linene was training her daughter, Minghee , to someday take over the business, which now found itself in stiff competition with the Phandalin Miner's Exchange under the ownership of Sharna Quirstiron . However, Minghee wanted to travel, or to at least find a job that would allow her to do so, which concerned Linene.</p>
