<p>Ishtar was one of two Untheric goddesses of love and war (the other was her progenitor, Inanna ). She departed the world of Toril soon after Enlil did. In her place, she left her portfolio and the right to use her name and appearance to the Mulhorandi goddess Isis . Her holy symbol was a female hand clutching a rod of blue crystal.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ishtar was portrayed as a beautiful human female with blond hair and blue eyes. She could change her shape at will, but never appeared in any shape save that of a beautiful woman. She wore the headdress of love and war , which forced any male she was truly interested in to fall passionately in love with her, and gave her the same powers as whatever enemy she fought. She drove a flying chariot pulled by seven enchanted lions . When in the chariot, nothing made of metal could touch Ishtar.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Ishtar was born from the goddess Inanna . Once they were the same being, but as Inanna's people grew more civilized, her pantheon split in two, with new aspects of the older gods becoming entities in their own right.</p>
<h2>Realm</h2>
<p>Ishtar dwelled in the City of the Star on the first layer of Elysium . It was a star-shaped city filled with love, beauty, life, and joy made from white marble. It was said to be one of the most beautiful places in the multiverse.</p>
<h2>Dogma</h2>
<p>By merely existing, Ishtar brought life into being. Although she was a goddess of war, she advocated violence only when it furthered life.</p>
<p>Ishtar's followers were charged to aid the farmers of Unther and other common folk.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ishtar presumedly came to Toril with the other Untheric deities aboard the Galley of the Gods . She survived the Orcgate Wars , but left Toril to rejoin her greater self in the cosmology from which she came shortly after Enlil did in −734 DR . Isis continued to use her name and aspect after that date.</p>
