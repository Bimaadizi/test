<p>Slobberchops was the pet tressym of the Vanthampur family from Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The tressym had a mean appearance, with multiple scars and a bobbed tail.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Slobberchops had no feeling of loyalty toward the Vanthampurs. It particularly disliked Thurstwell Vanthampur and his imp spies. Such was Slobberchops's contempt for its masters that it eagerly followed and helped any visitor who offered it food, warning them of potential dangers within Vanthampur Villa .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like all tressym, Slobberchops had the ability to see invisible creatures and objects, an ability that was frequently used to spot hidden imps.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Slobberchops lived in the villa's kitchen, feeding off rats and scraps. The tressym was depicted in numerous family paintings and was featured in a lifelike statue at the villa's gallery.</p>
