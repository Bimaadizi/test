<p>These enchanted items were crafted by Aslyferund , one of the most famous armorers of Myth Drannor, before the city's fall in the Weeping War of 714 DR . Many sages entertained rumors that the more powerful sets of Aslyferund elven chain were created with the aid of a gold dragon .</p>
<p>By late 14 th century DR , some of these sets of armor could be found in the Sword Coast North region, as well as in the town of Elventree of the Moonsea . By that same time, the imp Cespenar that once served the god Bhaal had learned Aslyferund's secret and could replicate it using a suit of bladesinger chain and a spell scroll of protection from normal weapons .</p>
