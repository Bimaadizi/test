<p>In the spring of the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR , Fleebo was a member of a band of robbers who happened to stop an extended family of foresters from Tethir led by a man named Wyancott . While the leader of the bandits questioned Wyancott, Star Protective Services arrived to rescue them. When he stood atop a wagon and aimed his weapon at Zaranda Star , Fleebo was shot dead by an arrow through his forehead from Vander Stillhawk . Zaranda then used his dead body in a failed attempt to teach her ward Chenowyn about death.</p>
