<p>Billitri plant's leaves could be crushed to extract a highly fragrant juice that could be used as perfume . The same smell could mask creatures' scents from dangerous predators of the Malatran Plateau . The scent was pleasant but potent enough to cling to one's body for several days after application. Some cultures used the leaves of billitri plants in magic rituals. Nubari folk of Malatra gave out fragrant celebratory wreaths of billitri plants to the individuals who won the traditional Challenge of the Warriors competition during the annual Council of the Tribes .</p>
