<p>Adreum was the last noble line from the coastal town of Last Port , believed to had gone extinct ten generations before 1374 DR , circa late 1000s DR . Lord Adreum VI was a part of the last generation of Adreums.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Adreum family's history became tinted with stories and legends by the late 14 th century DR . The town of Last Port was renamed sometime soon after the family's demise, becoming Port Llast . Locals believed the Adreum Curse would eventually fall upon the town, raising the dead and sending them onto the Port's streets. When the dead started showing up late at night on the streets of Last Port, some people believed it was the Adreums' doing. To give that theory more creedance, one walking dead was heard chanting the town's old name â€“ "Last Port."</p>
