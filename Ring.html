<p>A ring was a trinket that was placed over a finger.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Rings were often made from different metals, such as copper , silver , gold or platinum , and rarely from other materials, such as glass or bone. Some rings contained expensive gems , or exquisite designs and etchings. Rings could be enchanted to bestow magical powers upon their bearers. A handful of powerful rings had charges, but otherwise, their effect was everlasting. Some rings simply protected their wearers from a small amount of harm, whilst others could store extremely powerful spells . .</p>
<p>Anyone, provided it fitted on one of their fingers, could use a magical ring, but only two at a time could be active. If not continuously functioning, such rings were activated via a command word . A very small amount of rings possessed intelligence .</p>
