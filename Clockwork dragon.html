<p>Clockwork dragons were a variety of clockwork constructs made to resemble dragons .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They resembled finely crafted statues plated in the metals that corresponded to the varieties of metallic dragons , including brass , bronze , copper , silver , or faux gold .</p>
<p>Their size often varied, ranging from about the size of any humanoid to that of any actual adult dragon .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>These draconic creations were exceptionally intelligent and made for superb guardians. They could be "programed" to take a series of intricate actions depending on the circumstances surrounding any potential encounter.</p>
<p>Like other constructs, clockwork dragons had no need to breathe, sleep, or eat for sustenance. They were however vulnerable to any forms of magic or other powers that affected true, living breathing dragons.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Clockwork dragons fought in a similar manner to their organic inspirators. They could bite or claw opponents and use their enormous wings to knock others down with their mere presence.</p>
<p>They also possessed dragons' breath weapons, though theirs came in two varieties. Clockwork dragons could breathe lightning—in a manner similar to blue dragons ―or "repulsion energy", which sent their enemies flying back upwards of 60 feet (18 meters).</p>
<p>While in their preferred lair, clockwork dragons could create an obfuscating cloud of fog or blasts of sound that resembled the clap of thunder.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of the Duplicitous Courtier, 1496 DR , several humanoid -sized clockwork dragons were stationed outside the Orrery Vault as guardians.</p>
