<h2>History</h2>
<p>On the evening when Elminster Aumar arrived at the Alastrarra home, polymorphed into Iymbryl Alastrarra , she found Elminster with her sister, Filaurel Alastrarra , hugging him. He took cover behind Filaurel, so that Melarue wouldn't attack him; Naeryndam Alastrarra and Ornthalas Alastrarra arrived soon after. Ornthalas received the kiira from Elminster, and Naeryndam took him to the Coronal for justice.</p>
