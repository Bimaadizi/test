<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Reaper was a kensai retainer of the Ito family who died in their castle's burning in 647 DR . Thanks to the ancient curse and a krakentua 's influence, he did not truly die, but continued to haunt the castle as the first of the seven weapon masters. Finally, in 1360 DR, an adventuring party hired by Michimori Uemon to recover the Seven Swords fought and destroyed him.</p>
