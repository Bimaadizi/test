<p>Lady Yalaith Oruboryl was a beloved socialite and thief in Thentia in the 13 th and 14 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lady Yalaith was the only publicly tolerated professional thief in Thentia, who earned the adoration of the city with her high-profile and risqué crimes. The Lady Thief of the Parties would seduce a paramour at a social event, and after taking them to a private bedroom, would drug and rob them, tossing the valuables out the window to an accomplice. She would then re-join the party for a time before making her escape.</p>
<p>Her exploits were the stuff of legend, and being known to attend parties that she "worked" at was a status symbol in Thentian high society.</p>
<p>Thentians who traveled abroad would signal their origin to each other with a secret sign in her honor — flipping a coin down onto a table using two fingers of the left hand.</p>
