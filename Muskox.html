<p>Muskoxen ( also : musk ox or : musk-ox ) were a species of bovine and a type of herd animal.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Their bodies were very similar to that of an ox and they had short, curved horns.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Being herd animals, musk-oxen were generally non-aggressive. They would sometimes stampede away from those they considered threats to their safety.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Musk-oxen typically fought other creatures with their hooves and horns. When not running away from aggressors, a herd of musk-oxen would gather around in a shoulder-circle formation, facing outward towards their enemy, with their young in the center. If their enemy came too close they would proceed to charge forward and attempt to trample them.</p>
