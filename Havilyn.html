<p>Havilyn was a rich merchant of Hastarl in the mid-3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Havilyn was greatly wealthy and owned a grand home.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He had aligned himself with the Magelords of Athalantar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Havilyn lived with two other men who handled abundant money but were not known to practice any trade, more likely to be investors than merchants. Farl suggested scouting their home during a banquet they were to hold in 229Â DR to his friend Eladar the Dark, actually an alias of the Prince Elminster Aumar .</p>
<p>During that banquet at his home, Magelord Neldryn Hawklyn revealed he had acquired the Crystal Chain of Binding , a Netherese artifact, and sought to use it to demonstrate his mastery of a spell that brought any mortal to his presence. Despite Havilyn's lack of enthusiasm, he used his spell to fetch Dorgon Heamiiolothtar , the Magister of Mystra at the time, and bound him with the Chain .</p>
<p>Once the Magister was done killing Hawklyn, other Magelords, and some guests to boot for their conceit in binding him, Havilyn, spared because he was a honest man, spotted a young boy, Eladar the Dark, who was no part of his household, and had him pursued by the guards. Havilyn had also ran to where Fentarn was, and ended whatever event was taking place there.</p>
