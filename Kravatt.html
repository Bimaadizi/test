<p>Kravatt was a middle class inhabitant of the city of Baldur's Gate in late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kravatt was a light-skinned gnome with long brown curly hair. He had dark brown eyes and grossed in fanciful jackets and vests.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , as the Cult of the Absolute menaced the city of Baldur's Gate, the gates between the Lower City of Baldur's Gate and its more affluent Upper City were closed, monitored by the Flaming Fist mercenaries and allowing only the wealthy and current residents of the Upper City through. Kravatt was among the Baldurians who sought passage to the Upper City, suffering through the long lines and rude Fists. While in line, Kravatt contemplated "accidentally" dropping a pouch of silver coins to "invigorate" tired Fists and speed up the queue.</p>
