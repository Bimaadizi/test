<p>The Yaerthal Dynasty was the first ruling dynasty of Dambrath .</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The dynasty began in 545 DR when the Arkaiun warchief Reinhar Yaerthal united the Arkainun tribes of Dambrath under his leadership and led them to war against Luiren and Halruaa . After his death at war, his son, Reinhar II , took command of his father's army; however, he was defeated by Halruaa. Reinhar II retreated back to Dambrath and consolidated his new kingdom there.</p>
<p>In 600 DR , Reinhar III and his sons were killed by giants while on a hunting trip, and this triggered a brief war of succession. At the end of it, Reinhar III's nephew succeeded him and took the name Reinhar IV .</p>
<p>The entire dynasty contained nine kings of the same name. By the time of Reinhar IX in 802 DR , the Arkaiun of Dambrath were a lazy people, yet Reinhar the Foolish, as he was known to history, insisted on leading his people to expand their territory as Reinhar I had attempted. His plans were stopped, however, when his people encountered the drow of T'lindhet , leading to a 30-year war. The war ended with betrayal in 831 DR when a half-elven priestess of Loviatar named Cathtyr Shintar offered her assistance and that of her fellow half-elven pilgrims to the humans to defend against the drow. Instead, Cathtyr murdered Reinhar within a week and offered a truce to the drow armies, thus setting herself up as the new queen of Dambrath and founder of the Crinti Hazm'cri Dynasty .</p>
