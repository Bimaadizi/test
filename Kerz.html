<p>Kerz was a half-orcish paladin and mercenary who died in the 15 th century DR , killed by the Cult of the Absolute .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kerz was a big and muscular half-orc with a shaved head, light brown eyes, and gray hide.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kerz spent many years offering their hammer and skills to the highest bidder and eventually, the rough life of struggle and fight left a toll. One day, Kerz befriended a gang of nice ogres and laid down their hammer to teach the group etiquette. However, that friendship was cut short when the ogres were attacked and cut down one night, leading Kerz to pick up their weapon once again in vengeance. Subsequently, Kerz was killed by the Cult of the Absolute in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . Their soul yearned for revenge and ended up among the hand-picked dozen individuals plucked from the Fugue Plane , chosen by the entity called Withers to aid in his campaign against the Dead Three and their Cult of the Absolute.</p>
