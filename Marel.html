<p>Marels were a subrace of evil aquatic elven race that worshiped Umberlee .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These pale skin elves had blackish-green hair and green eyes which had an phosphorescent glow. They were otherwise identical to aquatic elves.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Marels wore armor made of shells. They primarily fought with tridents , spears , and nets , and often adorned them with the spines of rare and poisonous aquatic plants. Marel spellcasters would often attempt to dispel the magic that allowed surface-dwellers to breathe underwater, delighting in watching them drown.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Marel were normal aquatic elves until they refused to help the human city of Northkeep in 400 DR and were punished by the gods, transforming them into marel.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<h3>Settlement</h3>
<p>The only marel city was Mareliar. Marel buildings were elaborately carved from deep-water corals. In 1367 DR , the population was around 2,000 marels, including around 500 children. It was ruled by King Uhlmor and Queen Oaleah . The city had two portals, one that led to the Elemental Plane of Water and one that led to Umberlee's realm, which at the time was a layer of the Abyss .</p>
<h3>Culture</h3>
<p>Marels were compelled to guard the sunken city of Northkeep, but hated this duty and in particular despised the ever-ringing bells of the high tower as it reminded them of their failure. They tried in vain to silence the bells whenever they could.</p>
<p>Marels enjoyed crawling aboard ships in the dark of night and silently killing the crew, sometimes leaving a few members alive to spread fearful stories. They were often referred to as "sea drow" by superstitious mariners, although there was no relation to true drow .</p>
<h3>Magic & Religion</h3>
<p>Following the sinking of Northkeep, the marels turned their worship to Umberlee instead of Deep Sashelas or the Seldarine . Eight was a sacred number to them.</p>
<p>Unlike other aquatic elves, marels had the usual ratio of mages for elven races.</p>
<h3>Relations</h3>
<p>Marels did not cooperate with other evil aquatic races, preferring to be left alone. They also hated surface elves.</p>
