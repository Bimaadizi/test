<p>Rhytella was a human priestess of Lolth from Bezantur , Thay . She was active in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Despite being the most powerful permanent member of Bezantur's Temple of Lolth , Rhytella considered herself a mere acolyte of her goddess .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As of the late 1360s DR, Rhytella held authority over the entire congregation of Lolth worshipers in Bezantur, and thus oversaw the Temple's midnight services attended by humans in drow -inspired costumes. However, she was not officially the High Priestess as that title and honor belonged to Triel Teienna , a drow who visited the Temple from the Underdark once every few months.</p>
