<p>A yeoman's fiddle was a mechanical musical instrument invented by the gnome artist Nadul Da Roni . It was available for purchase through Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The instrument had either a crank or a spring that turned a rosin-covered wheel against the strings to produce sound, while a set of keys connected to gears pressed the strings. It could include different wheels for different songs.</p>
<p>When played, a yeoman's fiddle attracted much attention, but due to its complex nature and delicate construction it also had a small chance of malfunctioning.</p>
