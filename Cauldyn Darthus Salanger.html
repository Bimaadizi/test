<p>Cauldyn Darthus Salanger was the Magister for a month in 762 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He had been described as ambitious.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He had a number of wands, staves, and rods.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After defeating an aging Turnock Draether , he decided to dwell in the High Hall of Elturel , freely sharing potions and scrolls with important Elturians. He made a speech announcing himself as the Magister to the city, and immediately was beset by the first of " Turnock's Brood ", no less than forty of the sixty apprentices that Turnock had trained, who were intent on avenging their master. Over the next month, more of them made attempts to ambush him. Despite the fact that some Elturians heard his impassionated speeches that Turnock's Brood were evil and bent on harming the city, and their cooperation in killing anyone who was a mage, these wizards finally slew Cauldyn.</p>
<p>Rather than passing to his slayer, the title of Magister passed on to Veldrin Daerivyn .</p>
