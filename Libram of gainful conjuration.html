<p>A Libram of Gainful Conjuration was a tome of great value to arcane spellcasters of neutral alignment. After 1372 DR , the name referred to a version of the artifact that provided benefits to arcane spellcasters of good alignment.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>To make use of the work, a wizard of the correct alignment (neither good-aligned nor evil-aligned before 1372 DR , only good-aligned after ) needed to spend a week cloistered and undisturbed, perusing the tome. The earlier book would teach them approximately half of what they needed to take their skills to the next level; the later book instead increased the natural qualities of the magician that governed their spellcasting. In either case, the book disappeared after use, and no mage could gain the benefit of such a tome twice.</p>
<p>For the earlier version, arcane casters whose alignment was rejected by the book suffered severe damage, leaving them unconscious for 50–200 minutes, commensurate to the damage taken, and needed an atonement spell cast in order to continue their studies. For the later version, rather than physical damage, their basic health was undermined with no period of unconsciousness; they still needed the atonement spell to continue advancing in their studies. Anyone not an arcane spellcaster in the first place who read the tome was at risk of insanity .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>One libram of gainful conjuration was protected by four necrophidii in the Crypt of Badr Al-Mosak . Another example of the book was kept by the wizard Martek in the library at Martek's Inner Sanctum .</p>
