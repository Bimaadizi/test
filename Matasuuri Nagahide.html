<p>Matasuuri Nagahide was the ruling shogun of Wa around 1357 DR .</p>
<h2>Desciption</h2>
<p>Nagahide was a taller man than most in Wa, with very broad shoulders. He had a rough-hewn face that seemed locked in a permanent frown.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Nagahide was the most successful shogun of Wa. He ruled over a pacified land using a subtle approach instead of resolving all issues with the sword like his ancestor, Matasuuri Shogoro . His ruling style was all analysis and hidden control. He suffered from headaches and he brooded incessantly, however.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Nagahide was a superbly shrewd general and politician, being patient and analytical in his dealings. He was all business and seemed to lack any sense of humor. He believed his frequent headaches were the gods' punishment for not being focused enough on the rule of his nation. Nagahide was obsessed with order and showed no mercy to anyone.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After Nagahide became shogun in Wa Year 1754 (1336 DR) , he got the idea that the gifts of the Spirit of the Sun to his ancestor Shogoro were unlucky, and gave them away: the sword to the Shining Temple of Bishamon , the mirror to the businessman Oshichiro Yoto of Iiso , and the pearl to Yorifusa Ti , daimyo of Hotomori Province .</p>
<p>In the fourth year of his rule, Nagahide selected Benju Matsutomo , a distinguished general, as the next daimyo of Aru Province . Thereafter, the shogun took little notice of the distant province.</p>
<p>In Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR) , the Spirit of the Sun visited Nagahide in his dreams, learned he no longer had the treasures, and was offended. The shogun's tairo hired adventurers to retrieve the treasures.</p>
<p>That year, Nagahide sent Hiro Matsu, his personal inspector, to Aru to attend the Ceremony of the Three Thousand Steps in his place, both to honor Benju and to confirm his smooth governance. Hiro was accompanied by twenty samurai of the shogun's personal guard.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>Among his personal staff was the trusted samurai lord Hiro Matsu , who served as his official inspector and emissary.</p>
