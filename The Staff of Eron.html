<h2>History</h2>
<p>The The Staff of Eron was created sometime before the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR . The staff's owner was the wizard known as Eron the Dismayed, a notoriously pessimistic individual who believed in mastering the Art through magical dueling. He traveled the lands looking opponents but he believed that the roads were packed with thieves and assassins so Eron always dressed in shabby and inconspicuous robes. The staff he wielded appeared as a simple walking stick but possessed powerful enchantments.</p>
<p>By 1281 DR, The Staff of Eron found its way into the village of Kuldahar and the hands of the town's smith – Conlan .</p>
