<p>The Iron Fox was a bandit leader in the mid–8 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Iron Fox was a rotund bear of a man, with a face like a slab of meat covered in stubble and a thick mustache. He was so fat, his entire body quivered when he made sudden movements.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The men of the Iron Fox wore light armor and brought no lances or horses , relying on crossbows for hardened targets. The man himself wore plate armor and wielded a broadsword .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Among his eight most loyal men were Durlim , Rhen , Aawlynson , Gondeglus , Tarthane , and Llander . He had awed and disciplined the people of Buckralam's Starn into obedience. His forces were referred to as the Foxlings.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around early 755 DR , the Iron Fox and his men came to Buckralam's Starn and took over the town. They evicted the Chauntean priest Rarendon from the Shrine of the Sheaf and adapted the temple to serve as their fortress, Fox Tower. The owners of the farms nearest the shrine were exterminated, and the Foxlings killed and hurt people as they pleased, even taking some of the young women around town captive for their own pleasure.</p>
<p>One day, the Chosen of Mystra , Elminster Aumar , came incognito to Fox's Starn and fought the Foxlings. He killed about ten of them before the Iron Fox received the news. As soon as he learned of this, the Iron Fox decided to lock the tower down and sally in force by morning. That night, they were ambushed at the mess hall, where Elminster picked off most of his remaining men with crossbow bolts, then managed to fight through the rest and finally slew him with the help of a local woman, Immeira .</p>
