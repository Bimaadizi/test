<p>Giant space hamsters were large, muscular, bear -sized rodents bred by gnomes to power their spelljammers by running in wheels.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These animals were the size of brown bears , covered in thick fur that was usually colored golden-brown with white underbellies and spots. Despite appearing fat, they were quite muscular.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Typical giant space hamsters were docile and fearful, in particular domesticated ones. Even wild giant space hamsters, although more aggressive, were not sufficiently well-equipped to defend against predators.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Giant space hamsters were usually peaceful creatures, but wild varieties were known to be more aggressive. In particular, female giant space hamsters protected their litters fiercely. Their main weapon was a powerful bite. In some cases, a giant space hamster could also stuff a small creature such as a gnome in one of its cheek pouches, storing the victim there until spitting it out when a food source was found.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Giant space hamsters fed on a variety of vegetables, raw or cooked meats, and large insects.</p>
<p>Like their predecessors, giant space hamsters reproduced at an incredibly fast pace. They reached adulthood in about two years and lived up to about 18 years.</p>
<h3>Variants</h3>
<p>The reproductive process of giant space hamsters could be manipulated via the insertion of one or more enchanted substances at a certain point during the cycle. This process resulted in an extremely vast variety of outcomes, producing different and exotic giant space hamster variants.</p>
<p>Most variants were minor, with unique fur patterns such as albino, mottled, ochre, plaid, spotted, or wooly; different behavior patterns such as cave-dwelling; or morphological variants such as three-toed, lesser, greater, flightless, etc . However, some truly strange variants also existed:</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>Giant space hamsters were largely appreciated for their meat, which was called spaham . In fact, a considerable portion of domesticated giant space hamsters were kept as livestock for their meat. Giant space hamster hocks were also considered particularly savory.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Giant space hamsters did not evolve naturally. They were believed to have been created by gnome colonists from Krynn in order to serve as power sources for gnomish sidewheelers . This original purpose guaranteed that these animals spread throughout the crystal spheres .</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , crates with giant space hamster meat were stocked in Stardock to feed its githyanki inhabitants.</p>
