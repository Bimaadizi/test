<p>The Horngate was the great arched northwestern gate into Suzail , the capital of Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Horngate stood on the northwestern part of Suzail, where the Way of the Dragon ended and the city's grand Promenade began.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The arched gateway was topped with apartments, including the home of Huldyl Rauthur , a War Wizardin service of Vangerdahast Aeiulvana , the Royal Magician, in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The Horngate was guarded by a garrison of crossbow -armed Purple Dragons . Each person or group who entered Suzail through the great gate was stopped and asked to report their visit's purpose and to present appropriate paperwork, like Cormyr's adventuring charters. The Horngate was locked and barred during night hours, guarded by stone-faced men of the Crown. Entrance to Suzail was forbidden overnight.</p>
<p>Just like the Eastgate , and the Field-Gates , the Horngate was a citadel-like fortification that offered solid defenses to Suzail's northwest entrance. Its gatehouse maintained a detailed log of known spies and other individuals barred from entering the capital of Cormyr.</p>
