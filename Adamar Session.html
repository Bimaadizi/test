Over a span of twelve years, he spent his youth as an adventurer , traveling across nearly the entirety of the Vilhon Reach . A year after retiring, at the age of 29, he authored a travel guide on the region. [ speculation ]</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Adamar was possessed of a bit of a jovial personality, enjoying telling jokes and stories. Among the things he had a distaste for were slavery and serpents .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As a bard Adamar was capable of some degree of arcane magic . Among his known spells were magic missile .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>On more than one occasion as an adventurer, Adamar and his friends went in search of fabled ruins, such as Ironcloak , Nonthal's Hold , or the elven city of Rucien-Xan , the latter of which they spent months searching for. In the years they were active, his adventuring company never visited the Chultan Peninsula , the city of Surkh , or the Wetwoods . Of the three, Surkh was the one place Adamar had no intentions of ever visiting.</p>
<p>For several years of his life, after a visit to Sapra as an adventurer, Adamar devoted time to learning all that he could about the Emerald Enclave , including the ties between them and the Church of Silvanus .</p>
<p>Though the Emerald Enclave were his primary area of interest, Adamar had heard very tales of Red Wizards , Zhentarim spies, and even Harpers operating in the Reach. Most of the tales he heard centered around their activities getting them killed by members of the Enclave. In regards to the Harpers in particular, Adamar resented the assumption that most bards were secretly Harpers.</p>
<p>After retiring as an adventurer, Adamar worked as a teacher of history at the college in Starmantle. Long after his days as an adventurer were over, he continued making a yearly trip back to the city of Alaghôn to take part in their celebrations of the Feast of the Moon . However, he made it a point to always be back home in Starmantle before the next grand festival, the Reign of Misrule , began.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>For a time Adamar was part of an adventuring group composed of friends in Starmantle. This included Anathet the fighter , Dwin the Tymoran cleric , and Sarun the wizard . With Sarun he had a sort of love-hate relationship, often giving the wizard a hard time whenever he felt that he was getting too arrogant.</p>
<h3>Religious Views</h3>
<p>Over the course of the twelve years he spent in the Vilhon Reach, Adamar bore witness to a wide range of faiths, from arcane Azuthans to the fanatical ranks of the Umberlants . Due to his experience many travelers would ask him of the region's religious outlook, whether it leaned towards good or evil . Adamar always to such questions by saying that the Reach was an amalgamation of both, its people neither fanatical agents of good nor tyrannical servants of evil.</p>
<p>Over the years he read many a scholarly paper, post-dating the Time of Troubles , on the deity Helm . They seemed to indicate that the god had lost his powers from that cataclysmic event, but observing no lax in his popularity in the Reach, Adamar considered such observations to be hogwash.</p>
<p>Adamar felt that the Church of Eldath , what with its pacifist doctrine, was somewhat out of place in the contentious and warring landscape that was the Reach. For many years he had a passing curiosity with the Eldathan faith, dabbling in parts of it to see what he liked and disliked. After unintentionally attending a sermon in the Eldathan temple the Grove , he decided that the faith was simply not for him.</p>
<p>Unlike some in the Reach, he did not hold the opinion that Lliirans were no more than foolish revelers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Adamar began his life as an adventurer in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , at the tender age of 16. When he first heard about the island of Wavecrest , he tried to assemble a group of friends into an adventuring company to go explore it. Problem was, it took quite some time for Adamar to convince his friends that there was a reason to do so. Everyone they met would warn them that some kind of evil creature roamed the island, slaying man and beast alike. Eventually he managed to assemble together Anathet, Dwin, and Sarun. The small band set out for Wavecrest, intent on finding the fabled buried treasure of Captain Hanshet , a pirate captain whom legends say buried a thousand gold bars near a large grove of petrified briars.</p>
<p>They arrived to Wavecrest in the early summer and found themselves assaulted by the jungles' insects, namely mosquitoes . For more than two days they hacked their way through Wavecrest's dense forests, luckily never encountering trouble greater than the insects. They rested each evening with a campfire, regaling themselves with stories of Captain Hanshet.</p>
<p>Just as the adventurers were drawing close to Wavecrest's center they found a large artificial cave, made up of broken trees and shrubs. Instead of golden bars, they found merely a couple of copper trinkets inside and the lair of a shimmering jaguar-like creature , measuring 7 feet (2.1 meters) tall at the shoulder. Anathet drew his sword as the creature leapt at him, believing he could block its strike, but with one swipe of its to his head the fighter was sent tumbling to the ground with a nasty, bleeding gash.</p>
<p>The adventurers cautiously circled around the creature with the injured fighter, making their way out of the cave as the creature watched them with its emerald eyes. With panic they ran and stumbled through the jungle for several hours, making it back to their rowboat just as night was falling. As they paddled under the cover of dark, Dwin used her divine magic to heal Anathet. While none of his friends blamed him for what happened, with Dwin even quipping that "Fortune favors the bold," Adamar felt he was at fault for dragging his friends into such danger.</p>
