<p>The College of Cli ( pronounced : / k l i / klee ) was a traditional bardic college in Baldur's Gate .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The Cli lyre , one of the Instruments of the Bards , was named after this college and had been created by the legendary bard Falataer to test and reward his students who achieved mastery of the fifth, or Cli level of skill in his bardic college. The powers of the original Cli lyres could only be properly wielded by bards of at least the Cli college: bards of lower levels of skill could only obtain limited results.</p>
<p>The Cli mandolin was also named after the college.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The College of Cli was one of the seven elder bardic colleges dating back to Falataer, who had established it as the fifth level of his bardic college. Following this tradition, bards studying to obtain the rank of Magna Alumnae attended all seven colleges, with Cli being the fifth, after Canaith and before Anstruth . However, this practice was abandoned once the original colleges declined.</p>
<p>The college of Cli once lay within the eastern reaches of Baldur’s Gate, but its buildings have long since been torn down and replaced. The only remnant of this school is Elfsong Tavern , an adventurers’ drinking-place and hiring house notable for the ghostly elven female voice (once a student at the college) that can be heard from time to time.</p>
