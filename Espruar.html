<p>Espruar ( pronounced : / ɛ s p r uː ˈ ɑːr / es-proo-AR listen ) was the alphabet of the moon elves and the script used to write the Elven language .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Espruar was a graceful and fluid script that was composed of sixty-two characters, including numerous vowels. It was said that for each vowel in an alphabet used for Common , there were at least four versions in Elven. It was commonly used to decorate jewelry, monuments, and magic items . It was also used as the writing system for the Dambrathan language , Sylvan , Undercommon , and Aquan .</p>
<p>The script was also used by mortals when writing in Deep Speech , the language of aberrations , as it had no native script of its own.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Espruar script was originally developed by the moon elves, but had been subsequently adopted by sun elves , drow , and other elven peoples as their preferred script, remaining so for several millennia.</p>
<p>Around 1357 DR and by the late 15 th century DR, most elves across Faerûn used it to render messages, either in Common or in their own language. The language was also used on Evermeet .</p>
<p>By 1372 DR , a variant of the Espruar script was commonly in use, with characters that differed substantially from the ones in use in previous and subsequent decades.</p>
