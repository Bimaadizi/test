<p>Temple of Sehanine Moonbow was an open-air temple to the goddess of mysticism and the moon, Sehanine Moonbow that served the guests of the City of Song and its rulers that resided in the Castle Cormanthor .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Temple of Sehanine Moonbow was built close to the Castle Cormanthor to provide its inhabitants with easy access to clerics , councilors, and seers. The temple stood on the north-eastern side of the crossing of Dragoneyes Street and the Street of the Evening Star .</p>
<p>After the city was ruined by the Weeping War , the temple bordered an area of dead magic to the Castle Cormanthor's north.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The majestic open-air temples consisted of a plaza, pillars that held gentle silken curtains, a simple shrine to the goddess, and a small barrack building that the clerics of the templed lived in.</p>
<p>The illusion magic that protected the templed past the Weeping War showed nothing but ruins and rubble but creatures that knew of the temple's existence could see its vague outlines through the illusion .</p>
<p>The temple was protected from creatures that roamed the ruins not only by the illusions , but also by antipathy spells against creatures of evil alignment, the hallow spell, and the consecrate spell.</p>
<p>The east side of the temple was overgrown with blueglow moss .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Myth Drannor fell in the Weeping War, in 714 DR , the clerics of Sehanine Moonbow placed series of illusions and dream magics to mask the temple from the casual eyes and save it from desecration. The temple appeared nothing more than a plot of land filled with rubbles.</p>
<p>The temple remained safe under the illusion through 1369 DR , when a baelnorn Molostroi guided a group of adventurers searching to destroy Cult of the Dragon 's dracolich phylactery . The consecrated hidden temple was a safe area for them to rest and recuperate and, eventually, they used a hidden passage into the Elven Catacombs that were connected to Castle Cormanthor's underground levels.</p>
