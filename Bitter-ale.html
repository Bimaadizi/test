<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , many barrels of bitter-ale were stored in a small duergar stronghold under the Spine of the World , as Barud Barzam 's duergar were preparing to reclaim the Black Raven River , which long before itself was a duergar fortress in ages past.</p>
