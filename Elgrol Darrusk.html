<p>Elgrol Darrusk was a war hero sometime in the early history of Khôltar , the Iron City, located in south Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Elgrol was a very large and corpulent man without much grace in his movement or bearing.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was a lovable oaf who displayed courage when it counted the most.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When a horde of orcs assaulted Dubrinlar, the eastern gate through the double walls of Khôltar, legend has it that Elgrol held the gate single-handedly for hours before dying of his many wounds. A statue in his likeness was erected inside the guardhouse that served Dubrinlar, and the building was named Darrusktraal after him.</p>
<p>The gates of Khôltar were constructed during the tenure of Shieldlord Angloam Dubrin ( Year of the Alabaster Mounds, 577 DR , to the Year of Orcsfall, 619 DR ) so Dubrinlar (named after Angloam) was also completed during this period; therefore, the heroic deeds of Elgrol Darrusk took place sometime after that date.</p>
