<p>An undead lion was a fearsome undead lion brought to unlife by the mages of Thay .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A Thayan undead lion was a skeletal creature with its bones being of glorious golden hue. It retained its mane and had long and deadly fangs protruding from the bony maw. Its eye sockets held two orbs with a sinister red glow. Undead lions were adorned with battle armor and a saddle painted with the mark of the Red Wizards of Thay .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>These creatures were built to nominate battlefields via their necrotic roar, which instilled fear into enemies' hearts and empowered their riders. When an undead lion unleashed its necrotic roar, it dealt psychic damage to the creatures that heard it, reduced the enemies' accuracy, made them vulnerable to all types of damage, and could leave them stunned and vulnerable.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR , Thayan undead lions were known dangers, and individuals with enough coin could purchase such a deadly creature to use as a mount and ride into battle atop it.</p>
