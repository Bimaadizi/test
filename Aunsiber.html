<p>Aunsiber was a steward of Narthil in the Western Heartlands in the 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was visibly old, and wore a purple tabard adorned with moonflower designs when on official business.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He considered the rulership of evil mages to be a certainty.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He accepted the rulership of King Belaur and his Magelords of Athalantar as legitimate. Two riders in full plate accompanied him normally.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Bloodflowers, 234 DR , the priestess Elmara , actually the prince Elminster Aumar , struck at the power of the Magelords in Narthil; the steward came out to talk to her because of that. He was very skeptical of anyone breaking the control of the Magelords over the town. She eventually frightened him by saying she also had dreams of revenge, and then pretended to cast a spell on him. He immediately fled town, and Prince Gartos came in the next day with about sixty riders, strongly implying he'd rode out to where the Prince was.</p>
