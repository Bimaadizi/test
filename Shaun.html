<p>Shaun was a young sailor who served aboard the Marderward for a time during the mid—15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Shaun served aboard the ship under Captain Taraf Predeau , an abusive man who took advantage of the naiveté of his young crew. Predeau manipulated the children into assaulting each other, breaking the spirits of some and turning the others into uncaring brutes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time during or before the Year of Splendors Burning, 1469 DR , Shaun and the other young crewmen of the Marderward began to follow a new crewman aboard the ship, a man named Harp . Together, Harp and the young sailors broke the system of abuse that was rampant aboard the Marderward , and mutinied against the captain. During the mutiny, Shaun's job was to hold open the armory doors so they could all grab weapons. Their efforts paid off, and the crew of the Marderward were rewarded with their freedom.</p>
