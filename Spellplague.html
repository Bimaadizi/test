<p>The Spellplague , called the Blue Breath of Change by the inhabitants of Abeir , was a disaster that struck Realmspace and even the planes themselves on the date of Tarsakh 29 in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , and was caused by Mystra 's assassination at the hands of Cyric and Shar . It continued for a decade, leading to the Wailing Years , during which arcane magic ceased to function and the planet of Toril was transformed.</p>
<h2>Omens</h2>
<p>In her vision, the diviner Yaphyll referred to Mystra as the white queen and to Shar, goddess of the night, as the black queen. Cyric, god of murder, was the assassin; Savras , the god of divination, was the soothsayer, [ speculation ] , and the city , cavern and tree symbolized the ordered structures of magic crumbling into chaos.</p>
<h2>Origins</h2>
<p>The most popular and widely accepted theory about the origins of the Spellplague was that this calamity was caused by the death of Mystra, the goddess of Magic . For eons, magic had been bound within Mystra's Weave , the universal structure of arcane forces, and her death tore the Weave apart and unleashed the raw magic contained within it, creating the cataclysm that was later known as the Spellplague.</p>
<p>Other scholars, however, didn't consider this to be a logical explanation. Historically, two earlier incarnations of Mystra had died before only to be reborn, and the Weave maintained its hold over the power of magic for the duration of her deaths. In these scholars' views, the truth would never be fully known to mortals, and perhaps not even to the gods .</p>
<p>Around 1396 DR , the sentient construct Cynosure theorized that the escape of an entity named the Traitor from its confinement in the dungeons of Stardeep , around the same time Mystra was murdered, may have also influenced the Spellplague's virulent onslaught.</p>
<p>Around 1479 DR , scholars and sages who studied the Chasm of Neverwinter , such as Rhazzad , believed the aboleths of the Abolethic Sovereignty may have been the actual creators of the Spellplague, although there were no definite proof.</p>
<h2>The Plague</h2>
<p>Mystra's death caused the Weave to collapse and, without the Weave, the Shadow Weave was unable to be maintained and collapsed as well. The breakdown of the Weave was felt by all wizards across Faerûn . The corrupted madness of Cyric defiled what arcane forces remained from the dissolution of the Weave, resulting in a new magical source of defiling arcane energy in the form of blue flames that destroyed Dweomerheart and continued to spread across the multiverse .</p>
<p>Anything that came into contact with the Spellplague risked being destroyed or warped by its energies. Creatures and individuals risked becoming " plaguechanged ", which entailed massive physical mutations and often a complete loss of sanity, and sometimes bestowed the creature or individual with terrible powers. Those who came into contact with weaker versions of the Spellplague were sometimes lucky enough to escape with only a spellscar , which could also bestow potent magical abilities. Physical places could also be horribly warped by the Spellplague, becoming a changeland .</p>
<h2>The Storm of Blue Fire</h2>
<p>The Spellplague manifested in Toril as a storm of blue flames in the Mhair Jungles , west of Halruaa , and quickly grew to a massive size. Halruaan wizards, having divined the death of Mystra and the destruction of the Weave, were able to use the energy of the blue fire to save most of their kingdom by shifting it into another world, Abeir. However, the remaining Halruaan lands in Toril were laid to waste due to the heavy wild magic activity in the area, in such a catastrophic way that the explosion was felt as far as Waterdeep . Sespech , the Golden Plains , and the Nagalands were also affected, and those lands were transformed into an unpredictable and surreal place, dubbed the Plaguewrought Lands .</p>
<p>The blue flames also infected portals and planar gates , spreading even further across Toril. Almost every part of Faerûn was affected by the Spellplague and certain areas were eliminated entirely, while others were created anew. Thousands of spellcasters were either destroyed or went insane due to the collapse of the Weave after Mystra's death. In Cormyr , a third of the War Wizards were either killed or driven mad. Those who survived lost their ability to use arcane magic.</p>
<p>In 1386 DR , the Spellplague traveled across time and space, and reached the world of Abeir through the planar gates, and large parts of Abeir and Toril switched places (small, almost imperceptible parts had been switching places since the Time of Troubles but this event was markedly more noticeable). In Abeir, the Spellplague first appeared in Gontal , the southwestern region of the continent of Laerakond , where it made contact with ancient Glaur , the fortress of the Primordial Nehushta . The fortress detonated when the "Blue Breath of Change" ran through it, in an explosion as potent as the Tearfall , rocking the entire planet of Abeir and creating the Glaur Barrens where the old fortress once stood. Laerakond was torn apart in a powerful earthquake, and a portion of the nation of Skelkor , where the capital of the dragonborn nation of Tymanchebar was located, was torn asunder and disappeared amid the blue fire.</p>
<p>That region, where the city-citadel of Djerad Thymar , was located, crashed on Unther , still enveloped in the blue flames. Many believed the Untherites and the Mulhorandi occupation forces were obliterated in the explosion that leveled and reshaped the whole region except for the Black Ash Plain , but actually Unther was instead transported to the world of Abeir to the lands of Shyr , the equivalent continent to Faerûn in Abeir.</p>
<p>The rest of Laerakond was sent to the Trackless Sea , where it was believed it subsumed the lands of Maztica . Actually, Maztica was transported to Abeir, and Laerakond, which became known as 'Returned Abeir', remained on Toril, in a different location in the Great Sea .</p>

<h2>Aftermath</h2>
<p>The Spellplague led to political upheaval across the land that resulted in many attempted coups, invasions, and uprisings, especially against governments and nations that had relied heavily on arcane magic for defense or controlling their population.</p>
<p>By 1395 DR , the majority of the effects of the Spellplague had come to an end and most arcane magic had returned to a semblance of normality, with a handful of major changes to the way spells are cast. The Empire of Netheril came across the Lost Vale and displaced the saurials there into the Underdark.</p>
<p>The number of people gifted with psionics increased exponentially on Toril after the Spellplague. Some scholars believed this was a reaction against the Far Realm-defiling energy of the Spellplague.</p>
<p>By 1479 DR, areas of Toril still affected by the Spellplague were referred to as Plaguelands . In Neverwinter, victims of the Spellplague were expelled from the city to live in Helm's Hold , where those with severe mental or physical afflictions were sequestered in a terrible Sanatorium .</p>
<p>By 1480 DR , the Spellplague had ended with the event known as Mystra's Return . The Weave was resurrected with the goddess and magic became what it was before the Spellplague, though some areas with lingering effects from it remained.</p>
<p>In 1482 DR Lord Ao began the Second Sundering , as a way to restore the worlds of Toril and Abeir of the ravages of the Spellplague.</p>
