<p>Fulbar was an adventurer in his youth. He settled down in Daggerford after he acquired a dragon 's hoard buried deep under his tavern.

<p>His tavern, called the Happy Cow , was located in north Daggerford near the Farmer's Gate along Wall Street and the Farmer's Road . His home was the neighboring building to the south of the tavern.</p>
