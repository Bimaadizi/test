<p>Princess Darseera was the "Lost Princess" immortalized in the ballad "Lost Princess Road" .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to the ballad and to the research recorded by the sage Kalvaerus of Calimshan , Darseera mysteriously disappeared one moonlit night from the well-guarded garden of her father's keep in the Purple Hills of the young nation of Tethyr almost three centuries before Dalereckoning began.</p>
<p>In addition to the mystery of the date of her disappearance, it was also unknown who Darseera's father was. Elminster , the Sage of Shadowdale , suggested it was probably King Toroth "the Tyrant" who had six daughters from four different wives and was known to have conquered several neighboring realms, including one named Glaeron , in the early days of Tethyrian independence.</p>
<p>According to famed explorer Volothamp Geddarm , Princess Darseera did the same thing he did over one and a half millennia later: stumbled into a portal that was only active when the moon shone upon it. Indeed, Volo was on a bare hill (the site of a former fortress) in the Purple Hills on a moonlit night when he was accidentally transported to the far-eastern border of Amn . He went on to investigate and map out the entire network of portals known as Lost Princess Road from the ballad of the same name. In his writings on the subject, Volo admitted that the fate of the Princess remained unknown.</p>
