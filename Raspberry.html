<h2>Habitats</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The existence of raspberries on Toril dated all the way back to the days of Netheril .</p>
<p>In the mid–14 th century DR , a farmer from Thunderstone named Del Geery used the dried skin of a hydra to make coverings for his raspberry, blueberry , and strawberry bushes. This covering kept the air around them at a cool 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius), extending their growing period deep into autumn. The hydra hides proved to be effective only on these three types of berry bush.</p>
<p>During that same century, Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue sold bundles of twenty-five raspberry leaves, as well as brandied raspberries and raspberry preserves.</p>
