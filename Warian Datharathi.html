<p>Warian Datharathi was a member of the Datharathi chaka of Vaelan in Durpar . He became the first plangent prototype in 1367 DR , and then left Durpar to see the world. He returned in 1374 DR , worried about changes in his plangent arm, and would be essential in the re-sealing of Pandorym .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Warian's parents died in an accident and the young man never developed a taste for the politics endemic to his family's position. He was grafted with the first plangent prototype limb in the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , after losing his arm in a rockfall while inspecting a family mine. He allowed his grandfather, Shaddon Datharathi , to create a prosthetic for him; he was so thankful that he temporarily considered setting aside his plans of traveling. However, his sister Eined Datharathi recommended he see the world. He left, and did not return until the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , having supported himself up to that point by gambling. His return was prompted by discovering new powers in his plangent arm, which saved his life in a tavern brawl, but at the cost of an enervating loss of vitality.</p>
<p>On arrival, he spent two days in town before meeting his family. In that time he came across his uncle Zeltaebar Datharathi while trying to visit his sister Eined, who was missing. In their meeting, they insisted he go see his grandfather later that evening, though they were being manipulated by Shaddon. He noticed the wrongness of the situation, and while traveling to his grandfather's workshop with Sevaera Datharathi , he found Zeltaebar had stowed away on the ship. His uncle had made similar observations as to the behavior of his siblings, Sevaera and Xaemar Datharathi .</p>
<p>His visit to his grandfather turned sour quickly, as the latter would not let Warian keep his present prosthetics. Only Zeltaebar's timely, stealthy intervention with a crowbar to Shaddon's head, along with Eined's arrival, provided sufficient breathing room for them to escape, though Sevaera attempted to stop them, possessed by Pandorym. They had no choice but to flee into the Celestial Nadir , where they were saved from a possessed Sevaera by Ususi Manaallin and Iahn Qoyllor . From them, he learned of Pandorym, and of Eined's death.</p>
<p>Warian was part of the fight with Pandorym's forces not much later that night, leading to the elder evil's final sealing on Tarsakh 19 .</p>
