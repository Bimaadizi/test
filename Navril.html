<h2>History</h2>
<p>After spring began in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , the monks at the entrance of Candlekeep commented, when seeing the seekers coming after "Roablar of Lantan " (actually Noumea Cardellith ), that their entrance-gift might well be Navril's History of the Parsnip . He also said they'd reject it one more time, just as they had previously.</p>
