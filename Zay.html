<h2>History</h2>
<p>After being released in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Zay, Tha , and the other phaerimm in the War Gather captured a group of Evereskan warriors and high mages that sought to repair the damage done to the Sharn Wall. Notable among them were Tomb Master Kiinyon Colbathin and Lord Gervas Imesfor . Zay tortured and ridiculed the elven captives in order to attain more information about how to gain access to Evereska.</p>
<p>A short time later a group led by Melegaunt Tanthul descended into the phaerimm's underground lair to rescue the elves. During the raid, Zay was slain by the Vaasan warrior Vala Thorsdotter , wielder of a magical darksword .</p>
