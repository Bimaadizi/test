<p>The Stojanow river, also known to have been called the Barren River , began high in the Dragonspine Mountains and flowed south into the Moonsea . There was fertile ground along this river allowing for farming of some grains and hardy vegetables. To the west of the river was the Grass Sea , on most of the east bank was the Quivering Forest .</p>
<p>It was used as the primary means to transport ore and minerals from the Dragonspines to the cities of Phlan and Melvaunt .</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>The city of Phlan covered both banks of the river as it entered the Moonsea. Along the banks of its shores were several fortified hamlets, including Kabel's Hill .</p>
<p>A massive silver pyramid was built on a large island in the middle of the river, known as the Sorcerer's Isle , sometime around −100 DR . This was used as a wizards' school until it was later abandoned.</p>
<p>The waters of Stojanow river near the city of Phlan were unnaturally murky due to pollutions.</p>
