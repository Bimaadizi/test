<p>A scroll of protection from magic was an enchanted scroll that created a powerful antimagic field.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>After reading this scroll, a 5‑foot-radius (1.5‑meter) sphere of antimagic was created, centered on the reader. The sphere protected anyone inside from all forms of magic. The sphere lasted for 1–5 minutes. Some versions of the spell were so powerful that the antimagic field could drain magic gear, enough to make them mundane; this would however also end the antimagic field.</p>
