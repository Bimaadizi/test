<p>Callum was a male dwarf and a member of the Neverwinter Nine on the Sword Coast North in the 1370s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Callum was one of the members of the Neverwinter Nine. When Lord Nasher Alagondar issued an order to open a route to Yartar , he sent Callum to Old Owl Well to attack the orcs there.</p>
<p>Callum may have issued the Kalach-Cha with an order to find Issani , the messenger from Waterdeep , who did not arrive, as well as to contact someone who was attacking the orcs. Once the orcs' leaders, Yaisog and Logram , were defeated, Callum congratulated them and Casavir (the latter being his friend) then rewarded them.</p>
<p>During the Kalach-Cha's trial, Callum may have told of the victory at the Old Owl Well, as the fact Kalach-Cha helped him. Torio then asked if he knew that the Kalach-Cha's lawyer, Sand , was from Luskan. The Kalach-Cha then had to persuade Callum that Sand being from Luskan had no bearing on the trial. If successful, Callum would then ignore Torio.</p>
<p>Later, Callum appeared fighting a shadow reaver and his blade golems . Before dying, Callum warned the Kalach-Cha that Highcliff had fallen to the enemy.</p>
