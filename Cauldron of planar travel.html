<p>A cauldron of planar travel was a rare and massive enchanted cauldron that had the power to create portals .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These cauldrons functioned almost identically to a cauldron of gateways . The steps to activating it included bringing fresh water to a steaming boil inside of it, then put in some soil from the desired destination, and finally uttering the command words "I demand a path". Once all steps were carried out a translucent image of the location where the soil originated would manifest in in the steam arising from the cauldron , with he steam acting as a portal . The steam would remain active for around twenty minutes to as long as two bells .</p>
<p>This effect could only be activated once per week. The cauldron was unable to be transported through its own portal . And if an individual were to step through the steam as it was deactivating, there was a chance their body could be bisected.</p>
<p>Where it differed from a cauldron of gateways was in it not being limited to opening portals to locations on the same plane of existence . A cauldron of planar travel could open portals to any plane in the multiverse , so long as soil from the desired plane of existence was placed inside.</p>
