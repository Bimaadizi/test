<p>The Lapal Way was a road that ran through Lapaliiya in southwest Faerûn in the 14th century DR , broadly following the coast of the Shining Sea . It was a vital road for the realm.</p>
<p>From west to east, it linked Sammaresh , Malaxer , Abreon , Uzurr , Lhazantal , Zashuma , Ithmong , Mierskar , Lushpool , and Sheirlantar .</p>
<p>Before Shierlantar, the road crossed the River Talar at the Mouth of Istishia , a natural arch used as a bridge. Named for the goddess , it was wide enough for three carts to cross at the same time. Small towers stood at each end, garrisoned with well-armed soldiers to guarantee safe passage.</p>
