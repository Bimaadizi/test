<h2>History</h2>
<p>Rielle worked as a minner and scouted for the Tethyamar Mining Outpost as they looked for the jewels of ardor . On one mission, while she remained hidden her team blundered into a drow ambush. She managed to escape by swimming through a flooded cavern and dropping her gear, and got Eluf the Steadfast to send reinforcements for a rescue attempt. To her dismay, that team also got captured. A third group was assembled from surfacer hirelings, who proceeded to meet Rielle before proceeding on to fight the drow. She followed along behind them as they cleared the area, and stealthily freed her comrades while the drow were driven away.</p>
