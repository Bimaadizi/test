<p>Lallargh was a firbolg crone who lived in the South Jotunhammer Mountains on the island of Norland in the Moonshae Isles in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>She was adept at bestowing both physically and psychically deleterious curses on her enemies. Her injuries continuously healed themselves, and the first time an enemy slew her, her body would vanish and she would simply reappear as if she had never been hurt.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>She was masked and robed , and wielded a skull-shaped club that could blind any foe it struck.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Lallargh led the largest band of firbolgs in Grondsgrunn as of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR . She believed that for her kind to survive, they needed to sweep down from the mountains and crush Rogarsheim , which would allow them to take the rest of Norland with ease. To further this goal, Lallargh made pacts with duergar who lived beneath the mountains, as well as wicked mercenaries . All were promised a portion of the spoils after Rogersheim was sacked.</p>
