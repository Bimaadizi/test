<p>Raven's Rack was a shrine dedicated to Ilmater the Crying God, situated atop Tanarspear Hill , west of Hlondeth in the Vilhon Reach , and quite isolated.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1342 DR , a young underpriest from the House of Holy Suffering in Mussum named Kortolt Rushtyn found the Tome of Torment , the most holy book of the faith of Ilmater. Kortolt took the Tome to Raven's Rack and used it to aid both believers and non-believers, and to preach about Ilmater. The people of Hlondeth came to see Kortolt as a gift from the gods, one who kept them safe and well when they were sick or injured. However, Kortolt was killed by bandits in winter of the Year of the Boot, 1343 DR .</p>
