<p>Brightwing was a female griffon , linked to the war- mage Aoth Fezim .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Brightwing was (2.7 meters) long. Like all griffons, she had a lion 's body and the wings, forelegs, and head of an eagle. She had scarlet eyes.</p>
<p>She was named Brightwing because even as a cub, her feathers had been a lighter shade of gold than normal. Though her beak and throat were not made for articulating human speech, she could communicate with Aoth, who understood her clacks and squawks. Aoth magically enhanced her stamina and intelligence, making her a formidable foe. Brightwing loved horseflesh for feed.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Brightwing almost died in 1384 DR during the War of the Zulkirs , impaled by the sword of one of Szass Tam 's undead champions.</p>
