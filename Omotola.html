<p>Madame Omotola was a well-respected jeweler and gem merchant proprieter of The Glitter Gala from the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Omotola was a middle-aged human woman with a dark skin tone and blue eyes. She kept her blonde curly hair cut short. Her garb of choice was an expensive, richly embroidered green gown.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Omotola's shop had been doing business with the rich and powerful of the Gate for over twenty years. She dealt in gems, both mundane and magical, imported from Amn , Cormyr , and even Damara , and sold custom-crafted jewelry, including a pair of resplendent and enchanted wedding bands for Lady Patriar Firelia Jannath . As the Absolute crisis began threatening the city, many refugees tried to find employment and lodgings after fleeing from their homes. One such individual was Ellswin Glimrock , an artisan refugee from the city of Elturel . Ellswin wrote to Omotola, praising her glittering shop, and offered her services as a resident jeweler. Notably, one of Madame Omotola's business partners or investors was Lord Enver Gortash , secretly one of the leaders of the dreaded Cult of the Absolute . Omotola's business also supplied other fanciful shops with gemstones, such as Figaro Pennygood 's Facemaker's Boutique .</p>
