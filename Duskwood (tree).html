<p>Duskwood was a type of tree found growing all over Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Duskwoods grew in densely packed groves, blocked the light, and appeared rather eerie, giving them their name. They had smooth black bark and the trunks grew to an average height of 60 feet (18.2 meters), with small lacy branches high on the tree. Atop these trunks were small branches. The wood was smoky gray and as tough as iron .</p>
<p>Duskwoods were very resistant to fire, although their resin was famous for its fine flammability.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Some craftspeople fashioned weapons out of duskwood in place of metal. Such items weighed half as much as their metal counterparts. Duskwood didn't make good armor (even with a wood shape spell), though a passable breastplate could be made out of it. Mast spars and roof beams were usually made of duskwood.</p>
<p>The Blackstaff and the Scepter of Savras were made of duskwood. Thyrsus of the druid staves were often carved from single pieces of duskwood.</p>

<p>Duskwood trees were known to be found in the following places:</p>
