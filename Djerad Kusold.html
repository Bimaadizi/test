<p>Djerad Kusold (the Fortress of Kusold in Draconic ) was a ruined dragonborn city in Melabrauth .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before the Blue Breath of Change , Djerad Kusold was a city that served as home for the slave dragonborn population of Melabrauth.</p>
<p>During the Wailing Years , the dragonborn of Djerad Kusold were able to get enough dragonbane amber to start a rebellion against their dragon masters. The city became a fortress for the leaders of the rebellion. The city was later destroyed by Melauthaur the Undying One, who used powerful Dawn Titan magic to swallow Djerad Kusold under the earth.</p>
<p>In the later years of the 15th century DR, many dragonborn adventurers risked their lives exploring the jungles of Melabrauth in hopes to find the ruins of Djerad Kusold.</p>
