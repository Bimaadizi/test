<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Stormy Tankard stood on Hethbridle Street .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The place had at least one side door. The stairs were narrow, and there was at least one narrow passageway leading to a secret door. Some of the rooms were accessible from that secret door.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The place was noisy and filthy, with minuscule rooms and rather rickety furniture.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The inn served rooms, had a common taproom, and much "unclasped and uncloaked" merriment, strongly implied to be carnal, was negotiated there.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Shandril Shessair and Narm Tamaraith were pointed to the Stormy Tankard by Tessaril Winter while on their way to Silverymoon . Marlel , after rescuing them from the Sun Over Scornubel , helped the two newlyweds to the place; they were ambushed inside the inn, thanks to Marlel, but he denied all knowledge of the ambush and helped them find Orthil Voldovan afterwards, who was downstairs in the taproom.</p>
