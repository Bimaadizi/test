<p>The Chapel of Resounding Justice was a small fortified temple dedicated to Tyr located near Archenbridge . It was famous for the realistic statue of a planetar ornamenting its courtyard, and was a pilgrimage destination for Tyrran faithfuls.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The temple was protected by heavy reinforced doors. Rooftop vantages 20 ft (6.1 m) from the ground allowed the inhabitants to defend against attackers, protected by chest-high parapets circling the outside walls.</p>
<p>A well-stocked armory contained enough chainmail suits, shields and weapons to arm a dozen combatants. The chapel was usually manned by four soldiers and their captain, as well as a cleric .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa Year of the Ormserpent, 1295 DR , Tyr sent the young planetar named Resounding Justice against Krysus Vaant , a blackguard of Gargauth . The angel tracked her target outside of Archenbridge, and chased it southeast over several days. The ensuing battle pitted the antipaladin and a pit fiend against the angel, which paid the ultimate price in order to destroy its opponents: she sacrificed herself to blast her enemies with radiant energy , but transformed into a statue of white and gold marble in the process.</p>
<p>After finding her remains a couple days later, members of the church of Tyr built a temple around the statue, to celebrate and praise her selfless act in the name of justice.</p>
<h3>Magical effects</h3>
<p>The statue in the middle of the courtyard radiated a gentle divine magic , and at night glowed with a peaceful blue-white light. The temple reinforced the connection of the faithful with good domain spells, an effect especially strong for clerics of the faith.</p>
<p>The divine magic protecting the place also helped stabilizing people on death's door, and creatures resting there would find their wounds healing faster than usual.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Those touching the statue could still feel the divine presence of Resounding Justice . Some believed she was still inside, waiting for the right time to serve her deity again. This was the subject of much debates within the clergy: some believed that they should find a way to restore her to life, while traditionalists argued this would undermine the meaning of her sacrifice, and potentially undo the magic that destroyed her foes.</p>
