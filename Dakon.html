<p>Dakons were an uncommon species of ape, with a level of intelligence comparable to most humanoids .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These creatures largely resembled gorillas , but had light brown fur and black hands with sharp claws. Their eyes were of a green hue.</p>
<p>Males were known to wear anklets , arm bands, bracers , and head pieces. Females preferred to wear earrings, necklaces, and noserings.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Dakon were very proud and protective of their culture. They had a strong love for gold and would spare no expense to adorn themselves in jewelry made from the metal.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like many primates, the dakon were skilled climbers. Capable of climbing trees and rough surfaces in even the most tense, combative situations. They uniquely possessed an innate ability similar to the spell animal friendship , which any nonhuman primate was subject to.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Dakons generally never attack unless it was in self-defense. And they only used their sharp claws when unarmed. Typical weapons used by them when either hunting or engaging in warfare included blowguns , daggers , javelins , spears , and a type of club known as a knobkerrie . Their weapons were made of either bone, ivory , stone, or wood. Their knobkerrie were sometimes elaborately carved and shaped. And while warriors could be seen carrying all types of weapons, their priests only wielded blowguns and knobkerries.</p>
<p>They refrained from using armor besides helmets , considering it cowardly. They commonly wielded wooden shields covered with colorfully painted leather and helmets made from the skulls of their enemies. They sometimes rode elephants into battle, with a trained rider wielding a club and a warrior wielding one or more ranged weaponry.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Dakons were highly social creatures that lived in hunter gatherer societies which actively traded. With men acting as hunters and the armed escorts of female and child foragers. While their foragers combed the jungles in search of food and natural medicines, the escorts would check and maintain traps. All food gathered, just as all property besides gold, was owned by the community at large and equally divided among its members.</p>
<p>They lived in villages of under a hundred individuals, towns ranging from a hundred to five hundred residents, and on rare occasions cities that were home to more than a thousand. The houses of such communities were built in the largest of trees or thatched houses atop stilts, being as dakons were unaccustomed to using stone as a construction material. Their communities were also surrounded by wooden palisades for defense.</p>
<p>Each dakon community had a tower with a signal drum that served a variety of functions. Signal drums would be used to pass news, report disasters, coordinate relief, and make public announcements from the ghana or kaya maghan. During battles they would be used to direct action and make reports.</p>
<p>Communities also tended to have gold mines. These were operated by a community's criminals as well as slaves acquired from other nearby races. Other materials they tended to mine and trade with other creatures included silver , gems , and diamonds .</p>
<p>Criminality was low in their communities, but whenever it did occur there were several swift and harsh punishments for doing so. A dakon might be banished from their community, forced to perform public service, forced to work in a mine, receive a corporal punishment, or be reduced to a slave — there was no death penalty, however. Whatever punishment was received, the convicted would have a hand-wide strip of fur removed from down their back to mark them.</p>
<p>Nearly all dakon communities considered the following to be criminal offenses — adultery, cowardice, destruction of communal property, murder, theft, and failure to obey the regional leader. In addition to those, there were unique offenses decided by a community's leader. A criminal offense that was typically added by a ghana was failure to obey them or a sakir.</p>
<h3>Societal Roles</h3>
<h3>Homelands</h3>
<p>Dakons were typically found in the jungles of tropical regions and seldom seen anywhere else. In the Realms, they could particularly be found in the Marching Mountains of Calimshan .</p>
<h3>Religions</h3>
<p>The belief system of dakon was based on the existence of a Spirit World , that was inhabited by fiends and the spirits of their ancestors'. These spirits were considered to have a lawful neutral disposition and, comparable to a demigod , capable of influencing the material world through possession or magic .</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>Dakons had their own language and had a reasonable grasp of Common , but very few were fluent in speaking it. Their own language was largely based upon body posture, finger and hand gestures, hoots, and grunts. They also were capable of imitating animal noises, howling to communicate at long distances. Most could communicate with apes to a limited degree.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Dakons were on best terms with other intelligent apes, such as grommams . They tolerated the presence of primate-like or monkey-like beings, such as hadozee and banderlogs , the latter of whom they often fought alongside against their common foes. In addition, through their innate animal friendship ability they kept a variety of primates as pets and guard animals, such as gorillas, monkeys , and even carnivorous apes . The latter of whom would often be used to track down, flush out, and retrieve wild game. Dakons also domesticated elephants as mounts , which would be used while hunting or in trade caravans.</p>
<p>They had neutral relationships with most demihumans , humans , and needlemen . While most humanoids and giants were treated with antipathy. The creatures that they vehemently hated and would attack on sight were the qullan , tasloi , and yuan-ti . Banderlogs, humans, and tasloi in addition to elves , gnolls , kobolds , and orcs were the races that dakons most often took slaves from.</p>
