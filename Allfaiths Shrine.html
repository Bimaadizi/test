<p>The Allfaiths Shrine was a non-denominational, wayside shrine in the village of Red Larch .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The shrine was situated on the western side of the Long Road , south of the Swinging Sword Inn .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The shrine was constructed of stone and said to resemble a grand mansion. At its entrance were two wide wooden doors, each painted with the holy symbols of numerous gods.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The interior of the shrine was rather plain and had a simple stone altar. In the back of the shrine were two rooms for visiting priests to sleep in.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The temples in Waterdeep regularly arranged for priests of two different faiths to commute to the shrine for month-long stays, who would bring their own vestments and holy items with them. The most typical temple pairings were Sune and Selune , Tymora and Lathander , and Tempus and Oghma .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In 1491 DR , Imdarr Relvaunder a priest of Tempus and Lymmura Auldarhk an acolyte of Sune were serving at the shrine. The latter was a regular at the shrine for many decades, officiating countless marriages and becoming beloved by the locals.</p>
<p>Around that same time, a priestess from the Shrine of Luck named Garaele decided to become an intendent at the shrine after having received some visions.</p>
