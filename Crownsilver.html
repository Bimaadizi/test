<p>House Crownsilver was a royal noble house of Cormyr whose estate was situated beyond the Royal Gardens in Suzail , Cormyr . The family crest was three silver crowns that appeared to be falling, but were pierced by a downward-pointing silver sword, on a dusky-blue field.</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the family was one of two remaining royal houses in Cormyr. The Crownsilvers disliked the younger noble houses' mercantile activities and held House Alsevir , House Goldfeather , and House Marliir in particular disdain.</p>

<p>In the Year of Neomen Swords, 1448 DR , the house opposed the marriage of Crown Prince Irvel Obarskyr to Ospra Goldfeather .</p>
