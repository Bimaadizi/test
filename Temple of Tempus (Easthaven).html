<p>The Temple of Tempus in Easthaven was a fortified temple dedicated to Tempus the Foehammer. It remained standing for quite some years leading up to the late 13 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>It was a simple, one-story structure constructed from wooden planks set atop a square foundation. The walls of the temple sloped inward from the base, up to a roof some 30‒40 ft (9.1‒12 m) above ground level. Six panes of beautiful, blue stained-glass windows were set into either side of its walls.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The interior of Easthaven's temple featured several representations of Tempus' holy symbol , along with a magnificent statue of the Foehammer himself. The fiery sword of Tempus was displayed upon two enormous banners that hung within, as well as in an enormous inscription set into the wood of the temple floor.</p>
<p>Between the two banners stood the imposing, larger-than-life statue of Tempus riding atop his two warhorses, Veiros and Deiros . Just beneath the statue were a series of glyphs infused with Tempus' power, which protected a secret passageway to an underground chamber. Within that sanctum lay Jerrod's stone , a relic that held a place of importance in the history of Icewind Dale and the history of the local Tempuran faith.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The temple served as a shrine to warriors who fell triumphantly in the glories of battle. Arms and other weaponry wielded by some notable champions were collected within the temple, and put on display for the faithful. Notable among these were:</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>As of the late 13 th century DR , the temple was overseen by Everard , a member of the Order of the Broken Blade , and an initiate of Tempus named Accalia . Each day they held the Feast of Heroes for locals around noon, and performed the Song for the Fallen as the sun began to set.</p>
<p>Together they also performed the Song of the Sword for the people of Easthaven and beyond once per tenday , and offered regular remembrances for many of the famous battles that that occurred in Icewind Dale.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The temple was built upon a site considered holy to the church of Tempus , the location where the shaman Jerrod sacrificed himself to close a portal to the Nine Hells .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , the devil Belhifet ―who had been imprisoned on Toril ―used the Crenshinibon to create a massive crystal tower over Easthaven, centered upon Tempus' temple. Easthaven's villagers were rounded up like cattle, held captive until the fiend could carry out the final steps of his malevolent plot. Belhifet attempted to compel Everard to break down the protections of Jerrod's Stone in order to escape the Prime and return to the Nine Hells triumphant, having corrupted so many mortal souls.</p>
<p>A group of adventurers broke into Belhifet's crystal tower to save the people of Easthaven, opening a path for Everard to follow and access Jerrod's Stone beneath the temple. Belhifet managed to momentarily break the seals over Jerrod's Stone , but Everard threw himself upon the gate to the Hells, sealing it over once again. The adventurers slew Belhifet, inadvertently sending back to the Nine Hells. The crystal tower shattered into pieces, destroying Easthaven's temple and much of the town.</p>
<p>Accounts of the temple's fate varied over the years. Some said new temple to the Foehammer was eventually built atop its ruins, while others said the old temple was merely repaired and reopened. What was known, that the temple's numerous artifacts were moved south by the greater church of Tempus , to ensure their safekeeping.</p>
