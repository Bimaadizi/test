<h2>History</h2>
<p>Duke Darkwood's early life was one that could be expected of an Oerthian nobleman. He spent some time as an adventurer before settling down in his lands and starting a family. One fateful day, the Duke's sons accidentally summoned a cornugon named Ammagel by means of a magical deck of cards, and the devil attempted to claim them as his own slaves. Darkwood challenged Ammagel to a second game for the fate of his sons, and set down his own life as forfeit. The Duke won the game. His sons were set free but Darkwood was brought down to the Nine Hells and tortured for the next decade.</p>
<p>Rowan Darkwood's spirit proved indomitable. Ammagel tortured the mortal Duke for years but could not break his spirit. Eventually the malevolent cornugon came to respect his captive for his unshakable will and set him free. While Darkwood somehow managed to leave the Nine Hells of his own accord, he saw his family had moved on with their lives on Oerth, and he instead traveled across the planes.</p>
<p>He did not stay in one place long. Darkwood served as lieutenant to the deity Heimdall and even managed to save the plane of Ysgard from annihilation at some point. He was believed to have traveled to Vaasa in the Cold Lands region of Toril , during the 14 th century as it was measured by the Faerûnian calendar .</p>
<p>Eventually the Duke traveled to Sigil in the Outlands and joined the faction known as the Fated . Within one year after his arrival, Duke Rowan Darkwood ascended as its factol. His rapid grab for power challenged the leaders of other factions, like Erin Montgomery of the Sensates .</p>
<p>Some time before the Faerûnian Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , a play entitled Comedy of Terrors penned by the Doomguard Raelis Shai was performed within the city of Sigil. The play was overtly critical of Duke Darkwood and considered quite defamatory to his character. In response, Duke Darkwood dispatched a band of extra-planar bounty hunters led by the tiefling Aawill to abduct Raelis' troupe. The bounty hunters manage to track down the blade Haer'Dalis to the city of Athkatla on the planet Toril .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>An individual matching the Duke's description was present during the Bloodstone Wars when Witch-King Zhengyi was deposed from his throne in Castle Perilous . This individual was said to have gone on to live as a lord and high priest in Vaasa. While Duke Darkwood did claim to have lived in Vaasa prior to his arrival in Sigil, he never confirmed any additional rumors about his involvements there.</p>
