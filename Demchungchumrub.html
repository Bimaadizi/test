<h2>History</h2>
<p>He apparently took over the Many-Windowed Tower in the 11 th century DR, when passing nomads noticed the lighthouse restored and wisely avoided it ever since.

<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Although a loner, he lich was using his magical arts to wreck passing ships in order to capture their sailors. Those who survived, Demchungchumrub charmed to serve him, and those who were killed, he simply animated as undead . His goal was to crew his spelljammer ship, a converted great galley known as Delras . As of 1358 DR , his crew was near completion.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He was specialized in the conjuration school of magic , and incapable of both the invocation / evocation and greater divination schools. He prepared an array spells useful for waylaying and wrecking ships, charming the living and animating and controlling the dead.</p>
