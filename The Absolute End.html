<p>The Absolute End was a book about the dangers the Cult of the Absolute posed, printed sometime in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>This well-intentioned but hastily penned tome about the Absolute rightfully stoked fear of the new dangerous religion that worshiped the Absolute . However, the book's author conflated the cult's rise to prominence with other dire and possibly apocalyptic events, such as the resurrection of the lich Vecna , overabundant use of dark necromancy magics, and the heat death of the universe, and even managed to somehow connect the Absolute to the withering of fruits imported from Chult .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a copy of The Absolute End could be found in the city of Baldur's Gate, among the books belonging to Lady Firelia Jannath in her Lower City estate.</p>
