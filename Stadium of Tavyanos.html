<p>The Stadium of Tavynos was a stadium in the underwater city of Myth Nantar .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This stadium stood along Chamal Avenue , in Myth Nantar's Trade Quarter . It was one of the few structures in the quarter that was untouched by the overgrowth of the Three Gates Reef by 1371 DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>This stadium stood three stories tall and had a sublevel, containing a number of cells and staging areas.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Twelfth Serôs War , the forces of Iakhovas forced the merfolk of Eadraal to abandon their city of Voalidru and a number of other towns, fleeing to the safety of Myth Nantar. The city settled the refugees into the lower levels of the Stadium of Tayvanos, allowing them to turn its cells and staging areas into makeshift homes and hospitals. This arrangement continued for the two years that followed, as the merfolk found it insurmountable to rid Voalidru of the undead left behind by Iakhovas. The mage Jhanra Merlistar was regularly seen among the Stadium's refugees, tending to the injured and teaching their children.</p>
<p>In 1371 DR, a High Merpriest of Eadro named Narvolas joined the refugees, using his expertise to tend to the injured. A few weeks after his arrival to the city, Narvolas was approached by Prince-Regent Mirol III of Eadraal, having been told by a mysterious fish that the priest knew of a way to reclaim Voalidru. Narvolas then informed Mirol III about his experiences during the siege on Voalidru and of an undead repelling relic known as the Akriloth before sending him away.</p>
