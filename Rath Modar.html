<h2>History</h2>
<p>Rath was a Red Wizard of Thay who was exiled to the Sword Coast because of suspicions that he was involved in a plot by the Red Wizards to retake Thay from Szass Tam .</p>
<p>He was a key player in the alliance with the Cult of the Dragon , but unlike them was not a zealous believer in Tiamat . Rather, he desired that when she re-entered the world he would forge a Thayan alliance with her. This would be a part of the planned Thayan Resurrection, a greater scheme to depose Szass Tam and return the Red Wizards to power in Thay. Because of his exile, he wanted to take revenge by taking an army of dragons to Thay and conquering it for himself.</p>
