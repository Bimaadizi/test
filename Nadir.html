<p>Nadir was a rakshasa around 1480 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1460 DR , Nadir infiltrated the royal court of Suzail in Cormyr and killed several nobles until it was defeated by an adventuring party led by a paladin of Amaunator named Isteval . The rakshasa managed to kill Isteval's squire Eldrin Haunn but was eventually killed and send back to the Hells .</p>
<p>When Nadir managed to return to Faer√ªn , it started plotting its revenge against Isteval.</p>
<p>Around 1480 DR , Nadir located Isteval in the town of Daggerford and devised a plot to manipulate the schemes of the Red Wizards of Thay to obtain several elemental keys from that region.</p>
<p>First posing as the dead Red Wizard Arvik Zaltos , Nadir manipulated Sjachmalsvir , a black dragon , to obtain the water key .</p>
<p>Later, still posing as Zaltos, it went to Mt. Illefarn to help Arvik's apprentices in locating the hammer of Derwin Stonecarver , which was needed for obtaining the fire key . In the meantime, Nadir unveiled the betrayal of Skannon Tolker .</p>
<p>Lastly, manipulating Darrondar Gweth , Nadir attracted Sir Isteval to Dragonspear Castle where, with the help of a vampire cabal, he plotted to re-open a gate to the Nine Hells and have his ultimate revenge.</p>
