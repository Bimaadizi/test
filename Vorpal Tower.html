<p>The Vorpal Tower was a ruined tower in the Forest of Mir in Tethyr .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Vorpal Tower stood 45 miles west of Magis Tor in the Forest of Mir, one mile north of the Marching Mountains and the settlement of Iskashyoll .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The ruin was uninhabited and weathered by nature and time. Inside, one could only find lichens and various plants.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the tower was first discovered by a ranger from Survale Ford , sometime before the late 14 th century DR , the tower was already a ruin. It was distinctly damaged â€“ the tower was diagonally sliced in two, cleanly severing its two upper floors. The cut was what inspired the "Vorpal Tower" name.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , the dungeons underneath the Vorpal Tower were used as a lair by the alhoon member of the Twisted Rune named Ralayn the Occultacle. The dungeon hid at east three gates that led to the sinister organization's various rendezvous points.</p>
