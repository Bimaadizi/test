<p>Melon pie was a rarely-liked type of pie pastry stuffed with melon , predominately found in Amn and the city of Westgate .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the late 14 th century DR , melon pie was a rare sight indeed. It was served at the Harfin Draether eatery and tavern of Athkatla 's Temple District , where the "treat" could be seen sitting rotting away, plastered with flies . Despite its "appetizing" appearance, this pie was often purchased not for its taste but rather because it was served alongside a plateful of universally beloved sugar-cookies . Despite most folk's apparent aversion to the dish, it still had its fans, notably Ruldan of Westgate, a man famed for his proclivities, love for melon pies, and sculpting the Lady Rapturous , dedicated to Sune â€“ the goddess of love.</p>
