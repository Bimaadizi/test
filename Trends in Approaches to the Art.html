<p>The Trends in Approaches to the Art was an old tome found in Candlekeep that discussed magic and some of its associated history.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The book was rather large and heavy, held by ironroot panels and peryton hide. Orold Archemusk penned it with beautiful calligraphy and flourishes, accentuated by its black atharnscale ink that had not faded even if the pages had.</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>What the tome lacked in illustrations, it made up for in its runes, sigils, and drawings of complicated magical castings. These magics existed around the fall of Netheril , and saw a resurgence of interest in the early 12 th century DR .</p>
<p>Within his work, Archemusk appeared to hold considerable respect for the mages of Athalantar and the wizards who sought to conquer various portions of Faer√ªn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The tome was found by Elminster in the library fortress of Candlekeep in the Year of the Nether Mountain Scrolls, 1486 DR , and in a Amnian wizard tower about six centuries prior.</p>
