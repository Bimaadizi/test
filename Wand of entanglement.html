<p>Wands of entanglement were enchanted wands that allowed the wielder to cast the entangle spell.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These wands were created using vines that remained alive, growing out of the rod base.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The wielder could produce entangle spells at will. Each wand possessed as few as four and as many as thirty-two charges. After the Second Sundering , wands of entanglement with only seven charges were more common. These wands regenerated charges each dawn and could disintegrate into dust when exhausted.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR , several of these wands were unearthed in the deep Elven Catacombs of Myth Drannor , during the city's occupation by the forces of the Cult of the Dragon .</p>
