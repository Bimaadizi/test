<p>Mystic Carrion was a undead being that dwelled within the city of Baldur's Gate as of the late 15 th century DR . He offered his services as a "mystic consultant", working out of Philgrave's Mansion in the Baldurian Lower City .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He resembled a dessicated, if otherwise well-preserved corpse dressed it the pinnacle of undead fashion. His tattered robes were adorned with the finest gold jewelry money could afford to buy.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Carrion was an individual of refined tastes. Despite his state of undeadness, he enjoyed the lively music that filled the city's streets and valued the natural beauty seen at Gray Harbor , and even found serenity in the simple pleasure of watching the sunset.</p>
<p>Even for an undead entrepreneur, Mystic Carrion was a rather haughty individual. He only spoke with individuals that he believed at first glance could afford his services as a channel of undead spirits.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As a mummy lord, Mystic Carrion could not be truly destroyed until four organs taken from his mortal body—his brain, lungs, liver, and heart— were individually rendered. As the process dictated, each of these had been removed from his skeletal form and preserved within individual canopic jars , not dissimilar to how a lich 's soul was kept within a phylactery .</p>
<p>He was truly a powerful individual. Carrion possessed darkvision , resistance to poison , necrotic energy , and all forms of magic , along with the power to resist a potent supernatural attack if ever forced into combat. He was exceptionally adept at wielding necromantic spells and could temporarily bolster his capacity for spellcasting every time he took a mortal life.</p>
<p>Unlike lesser undead, Carrion could not be easily turned .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>As befitting his status, Mystic Carrion carried with him only the most grand regalia, including the Veil of the Morning finery, the armor of the sporekeeper , and the powerful hood of the Weave . He carried with him the Staff of Cherished Necromancy and safeguarded within a gilded chest the torch of revocation .</p>
<p>Beneath his boutique was a hidden chamber that housed his personal autobiography, entitled A Mummy's Memories .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Mystic Carrion acted as a medium for the wealthy Baldurian patriars of the Upper City . He provided for his clientele opportunities to speak with spirits that roamed the Realms to gain insight about their life or other highly-desirable knowledge. Carrion was an avid scholar knowledgeable in esoterica and alchemy , among other disciplines.</p>
<p>Like other powerful undead, Carrion maintained a secret lair secluded within the depths of the Baldurian Undercity . It was little more than a grand tomb, littered with scores of resting undead, with an attached laboratory that housed fuenerary reagents and accompanying literature .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Mystic Carrion kept in his alon a number of undead servants, which he raised from mortals he abducted from the streets of Baldur's Gate and murdered. Despite availing himself to wealthy clientele, Carrion was abusive towards the undead he referred to as his 'conduits', having repeatedly forced them to perform terrible deeds to further his business.</p>
<p>Notable among Carrion's clients was the painter Oskar Fevras , the famous painter and noted lover of the noblewoman Lady Jannath .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , one of the mummy lord's servants, a zombie by the name of Thrumbo went missing in Baldur's Gate. Thrumbo was one of Carrion's most favored servants, one who truly held his master's heart.</p>
