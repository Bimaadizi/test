<p>Sespech , also known as The Land-Between-The-Rivers , was a barony of Chondath , and later an independent nation, located in the southwest region of the Vilhon Reach . Though it was freed in the aftermath of the Rotting War , Sespech's sovereignty was tested for centuries by neighboring Arrabar , capital of once-great Chondath.</p>
<p>Known for producing horse -riding warriors of exemplary quality, the nation's capital of Ormpetarr had the best cavalry in the Reach, second only to that of Lheshayl . By the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR , the ruler and Baron of Sespech was Aldorn "Foesmasher" Thuragar , who focused on furthering their independence from Chondath.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Sespech's northern borders were traditionally drawn by the Vilhon Reach sea, which also fed the Nagaflow . This winding river, curling through the Golden Road and into the old Chondalwood , then served to mark the land's western and southern edges. Another river, the Arran , formed the eastern border. Outside the few established settlements, Sespech mostly consisted of grasslands, stretching from one border to the next. These included:</p>
<p>Notably, on its meandering path to the Chondalwood, the Nagaflow opened into a fresh-water lake before it narrowed once again. It was known as:</p>
<p>Beyond it, on the Nagawater's far, western shoreline, laid the Serpents' Holding , known also as the Slithering Plains; another grassland, but this one infested by spitting snakes .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<h3>Rulership</h3>
<p>Even after achieving independence, Sespech still named their ruler a baron, who reigned from Ormpetarr with the support of a court. In the days of Baron Thuragar, these daily sessions were public, if heavily-guarded, which—as past barons had not been quite as honest—earned him a measure of respect from the citizenry. The baron was also assisted by the lesser rulers of Sespech's remaining two settlements: Mimph and Elbulder .</p>
<p>As a one-time adventurer , when the Lord Foesmasher took control of the nation, he put past members of his party, the Band of Iron , in power. In doing so, he removed the previous, opportunistic rulers, bringing a sense of unity to the nation, alongside proper justice and more reasonable taxation. To rule Mimph, he chose the priestess of Helm , Marsa Ferrentio , and to rule Elbulder, he named the wizard Gavilon Jostins as Lord-Mayor; though not a traditional settlement, the Baron also put the fighter Marcius Stonehall in place as general of Fort Arran .</p>
<h3>Court of Public Opinion</h3>
<p>Traditionally, politics were never discussed publicly in Sespech. The only exceptions to this custom were a series of communal discussions, outlawed by previous authorities but reinstated by Baron Thuragar. At these gatherings, taking place twice each month, both men and women across Sespech were encouraged to voice their grievances and desires to the baron's ministers. Though Lord Foesmasher would, in a rare few cases, forgo such intermediaries and attend the gatherings publicly, he generally relied on these trusted members of his court to report the Sespechians' opinions to him.</p>
<p>The baron was also known to employ messengers and spies alike for a similar purpose. As the distance between the settlements of Sespech made communication difficult, the news gathered by his spies would be deposited in Mimph and then, by messenger, be transported most often to Ormpetarr or Fort Arran. Although this information could simply focus on current events, it just as often involved word of military action or trade dealings, as Sespech planted spies in the Vilhon's many city-states as well as Arrabar.</p>
<h3>Relations</h3>
<p>One essential fact weighed on any and all discussion of Sespech's politics, and that was the threat posed by Chondath's continued existence. It was this same, ever-present danger that forced Sespech to make concessions in other dealings, establishing allegiances with nations or city-states that it would, in most other cases, prefer to keep at sword's reach.</p>
<p>Hlondeth , the City of Serpents, was a notable example. Though it would have been the baron's preferrence that their alliance be kept purely economic, Sespech required the yuan-ti 's aid in establishing a navy presence in Mimph. To garner favor with House Extaminos , the ruling family of Hlondeth, Baron Thuragar relented his critiques of the courtship between his daughter, Glisena , and the Extaminos' son, Dmetrio .</p>
<p>In his wisdom, the baron also looked beyond his low opinion of Nimpeth and its lord, Woren . Despite his urges to turn the Sespechi armies upon the city-state, erasing it from the Vilhon entirely, he acknowledged that the city-state, much like his own nation, was simply focused on self-preservation.</p>
<p>The historical conflict between Chondath and Sespech earned them both the favor of Tempus , the Lord of Battles. Even as of Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , , military patrols between the two nations frequently broke out into skirmishes, on the verge of starting a war they were both oft ready for.</p>
<p>In the name of the Foehammer, the Tempuran clergy itself worked to stoke the tensions between Sespech and its once-metropole, particularly through the opposing church leadership of Generals Clas Denwith and Vandemar Cordwin . The former, representing Sespech, insulted both the rulers and martial abilities of Arrabar, whilst the latter, an Arrabaran, was publicly hostile towards Baron Thuragar, backed by the city's ruling house.</p>
<p>By the same year, Sespech suffered the occasional depredations of the Company of the Hunt , a Malarite group based in the Winterwood . These outlaws, numbering more than 50, worshiped the Stalker and were led by Jaras Silverblood , their huntmaster and a wanted criminal in nearby Turmish .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<h3>Mercantile Centers</h3>
<p>As a whole, Sespech was known to export horses, mercenaries , and salt , while importing metal. The nation relied on Mimph to serve as a port for merchants coming south-west from the rest of the Vilhon Reach, but it's proximity to Arrabar meant they were often harrassed. To avoid this, and prevent the theft of their cargo by Chondathan hands, the port city often relied on adventurers, supplementing the navy Sespech hoped to build.</p>
<p>Ormpetarr was another important hub of trade in the nation, though it typically reached west, across the Nagawater, to exchange grain and wine with Nimpeth. Historically, given its placement on the Golden Road, the city had served an important role in any trade going further south to, or north from, Innarlith —and, beyond it, the rest of the Shining South . By the time Baron Thuragar took control, the traders of Ormpetarr threw their full support behind him. National stability proved much more benefical to the merchants' endeavours than the constant, uncertain chaos of years prior, so they dedicated themselves to ensuring Sespech's stability.</p>
<h3>Slave Trade</h3>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR , Sespech maintained a successful slave trade , with the slaves themselves in pervasive use across the nation and the nearby free cities. They were regarded as a possession of their master's, and frequently descended from generations of other slaves, but their treatment was not uniform. A slave might be subject to a comfortable life, or to one worse than that of an unconscious object; very rarely, a slave was even married off to their owner, as it was not rare to see a man with multiple wives in the Vilhon.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<h3>Conscription</h3>
<p>Much like the smaller city-states of the Vilhon Reach, Sespech expected its male population to serve in the military once they reached adulthood. Though the citizenry's enlistment commonly lasted for four years, Baron Foesmasher raised it to six, as soldiers both capable and plentiful were needed to guard against the perptual threat of Chondath. Even after their six mandated years, however, a soldier could be called back into action at any time. Most joined the army, but the two societal extremes had their exceptions: slaves were considered below such work, unless in a time of dire need, whereas other families were rich enough to have their sons join the diplomatic corps instead.</p>
<p>Often, a Sespechian warrior was of chaotic temperament and independent character. As a whole, they were known to be a stubborn, even prideful, lot, and were rarely amicable around those who didn't share such a disposition. Their perpetual battle-readiness made it difficult to catch a warrior of Sespech off-guard, but it often also fed a sense of paranoia. Despite these flaws, and their distaste for orderly governments, the baron's men were loyal. If they found easygoing company in someone not already sworn to the cause, a warrior would work their hardest to convince their new fellow of its merits.</p>
<p>To symbolize this loyalty to the Baron Foesmasher, the soldiers of Sespech wore helments with purple feathers as part of their military uniforms. In terms of armor, they favored chainmail or plate , but eschewed shields , preferring the use of impressive, two-handed weapons: polearms , battleaxes , bastard swords , and greatswords were all common choices. Such inclinations were not without purpose. The baron placed a great deal of importance on ensuring his soldiers were outwardly-formidable, with ready, strong bearings. Outside of combat, they were expected to be visible, if not practically on display, and to awe the citizenry with their presence; more than just a fighting force, the army was a message.</p>
<p>So valuable were his soldiers, however, that Thuragar was reticent to give them leave to adventure. He armed and paid them well, ensuring their happiness, but he denied one out of four such requests. In these cases, the soldier in question would need to pay hundreds of gp as a bribe before leaving their post—and, whether they went on with or without the baron's permission, they were to return upon their adventure's end. Beyond these urban guardposts, the army patrolled all of the lands within Sespech's borders—though few troops were known to venture into the Naga Plains.</p>
<h3>On the Borders</h3>
<p>A thousand Sespechi soldiers were stationed at Fort Arran, a military outpost on the nation's eastern border. Where it overlooked the crossing of the River Arran, the fort served as a first line of defense against an overland attack from Chondath should war truly break out. It was an assignment accepted with honour by most soldiers, who knew they would serve to slow the invaders down while Sespechian messengers raced to carry word to the nation's three cities.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>The Dawn of Three Cities</h3>
<p>The nation of Sespech began with the establishment of a single settlement—Mimph, against the Vilhon's coast—in the Year of the Vanished Tattoo, 92 DR . Even amongst the other burgeoning settlements of the Vilhon Reach, this particular city rose quickly in status. It was unfortunate that this also earned it the ire of Arrabar, their neighbour to the east, for only 43 years later, in the Year of the Halfling's Dale, 135 DR , the Arrabarans burned their young foe to the ground.</p>
<p>In the time that followed, circa 150 DR , humanity continued to spread across the Vilhon Reach. Only a handful of years after the fall of Mimph came the construction of Ormpetarr, the City on the Plains. It contributed a great deal to the Reach's settlement through the creation of the Golden Road, which stretched north to Arrabar and south to Innarlith, and in so doing installed itself as a rich center of trade and an essential intermediary for anyone wishing to deal with the Shining South.</p>
<p>During Ormpetarr's years of toil, the city of Mimph was rebuilt to the north, and the village of Elbulder, to the south-east, sprouted along the Old Road . Arrabar, now capital of the Chondathian Empire, continued to involve itself, providing support for the City on the Plains at the pleas of its mayor, whose settlement sat defenseless. The Chondathans, however, recognized that razing their neighbors would prove less useful than subjugating them, and so it was that they were first established as the Barony of Sespech. Soon, Ormpetarr, Mimph, and Elbulder were enfolded into the nearby empire.</p>
<h3>The Dawn of a Barony</h3>
<p>The three were not, however, willing subjects. Though they attempted more than six times, across centuries, to gain their independence, the power and proximity of Chondath meant that the Sespechians had little chance to escape, for the empire simply marched into their borders, past the walls of Ormpetarr, and installed a new—and more complaisant—baron.</p>
<p>This golden age of the Chondathan Empire lasted until the Year of the Thirsty Sword, 900 DR , when it became embroiled in a terrible civil war. The two-year conflict, later known as the Rotting War, was punctuated by the unleashing of a magic plague , Netherese in origin, that decimated much of the empire's population and its authority. With this splintering, the barony was finally able to put its own army in Ormpetarr and, in the Year of the Queen's Tears, 902 DR , claim independence as the nation of Sespech.</p>
<h3>The Dawn of a Nation</h3>
<p>The centuries that followed proved unstable, with many would-be tyrants installing themselves and then being violently deposed. This fate was doubly true for the many more barons that were lynched by Sespechians when their Chondathan allegiances were revealed.</p>
<p>During this long period of instability, in the Year of Moonfall, 1344 DR , Sespech learned of the elven Retreat . In response to the exodus, Sespech was quick to sponsor its lumberjacks, sending them to both the Chondalwood and the Winterwood. These two were sources of bountiful, and now-undefended, lumber—or so the humans thought. When arrows streamed from the Chondalwood at their first parties, they realized that its elven inhabitants had not been so quick to heed Cormanthor 's call, and when a circle of Emerald Enclave druids met them in the Winterwood, the Sespechians were forced to return, unbloodied but empty-handed.</p>
<p>At some point circa 1364 DR , blood ran freely in Sespech. The nation was wracked by serial assassinations, and the ensuing chaos led to yet-another mass uprising. At its head was the local adventurer, and influential noble, Aldorn Thuragar, who astonished Chondath and their latest sycophant, Baron Ricjolo Tomrase , by taking his predecessor's title by force. Promptly, Thuragar ordered the man crawl back to Arrabar.</p>
<p>In response, neighbouring Chondath again attempted to intercede in Sespech's politics. Though the Lord of Arrabar sent a force of "peace-keepers" towards Ormpetarr, they found themselves rebuffed at the nation's eastern border, where Sespech's army stood ready. It was at Arranford that a battle ensued, and as soon as Sespech had claimed victory, it was also there that the new baron set up Fort Arran.</p>
<p>The Arrabarans were not quick to accept defeat, however, and another contingent of soldiers was soon sent to reclaim Elbulder, which sat further south on Sespech's border. Much as the new baron had done with the nation's other settlements, he had installed as ruler a friend from his adventuring days: Gavilon Jostins. Thuragar's trust was well-placed, for, through fearsome lightning bolts and fireballs , Jostins turned back the men of Chondath. With the knowledge that the baron and his trusted friends were in power, the Sespechians could finally, tenuously, believe that peace was coming to the nation.</p>
<p>Six years after these events, by 1370 DR , Foesmasher's rule continued to be an even-handed one. He focused on ensuring that the barony not slip back into Chondath's possession, as, even then, nearly half a millennium after first declaring independence, Sespech could not afford to relent in its fight against Arrabar. The nation also looked towards both the Chondalwood elves and the Emerald Enclave with suspicion. Though the Sespechians had immediately adored Baron Thuragar, many still believed that he was culpable for the deaths that had paved his path to power.</p>
<h3>The Dawn of Catastrophe</h3>
<p>In the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , only twenty-one years after the the Baron and his Band of Iron took control, a great calamity overran Toril . This Spellplague changed the face of Faerûn and greatly affected the whole Vilhon Reach. Though Sespech's greatest foe, Chondath, was destroyed—replaced by the lands of Akanûl —the barony had little time to rejoice, as it, too, fell to the destructive Blue Fire.</p>
<p>Much of what was once Sespech became known as the Plaguewrought Land . Within it, the Spellplague raged on, almost a century after it had passed over the rest of the world. Beyond this surreal landscape and the ruins it left behind, the only true remnant of Sespech was its capital, which served as the sole bastion of civilization left in the region. Ormpetarr, by the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , was claimed by no other nation or outside authority. It was a lawless city of frontier justice, accustomed to the proximity of the Plaguewrought Land's strange and dangerous nature, as well as the headquarters of the Order of Blue Fire .</p>
<p>Only after the Second Sundering , in the 1480s DR, did some measure of the old Sespech return. The settlements of the Vilhon Reach were variously brought back to Toril, in one form or another, and the terrible scar of the Plaguewrought Land was excised, bringing back the plains of centuries past.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>The nation of Sespech was made up of only three proper cities, each separated by the region's geography, unconnected by road or river. These included, from northern-most to southern-most:</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<h3>Demographics</h3>
<p>Given their shared descent, the humans of Sespech were said to appear much like those of Chondath, with a dusky complexion and of tall height. They were sometimes regarded as a "nation of smooth-faced children", for Sespechians customarily shaved and kept their hair short. Despite a Chondathan majority, a sizeable portion of Sespech's population had Shaaran blood, while a much smaller proportion were descendants of Calishite or even Turami heritage.</p>
<p>The demihumans of the Vilhon tended to settle elsewhere, but Sespech nonetheless had a fair population of half-elves .</p>
<h3>Local Culture</h3>
<p>Magic was regarded negatively in Sespech; if used blatantly, it was disapproved of, and if used to harm someone else, the nation's government was swift to punish the perpetrator with death. Though no schools of magic existed across the barony, the Art was historically better received in the city of Elbulder.</p>
<p>Atop the typical Sespechi garb of long, toga-like robes, the barony's wizards further distinguished themselves by wearing draping hoods and capes to obscure their faces. This practice was an olden style borne of Sespechian superstition, which held that seeing a spellcaster's face courted bad luck. Though often trustworthy, it was rare to see a mage in Sespech of lawful alignment , given how sharply public opinion could shift based on the current government; in a matter of decades, a wizard might go from valued, to disparaged, to outlawed—even outright hunted.</p>
<p>Much like the rest of the Vilhon Reach's inhabitants, Sespechians customarily painted their foreheads with dots. This thousand-year tradition, by the 14 th century DR, could involve one, two, or three dots, each indicating something about the individual on which they were painted: if they could read, they had only one dot; if they could write, they had two; and if they could cast magic, they earned a third dot. A warrior, for example, would never paint a third dot on themselves. To lie about one's abilities, however, was a dangerous gamble, as any guard or noble in the Reach could publicly demand proof of a person's skills. If the scrutinized individual failed to show their aptitude, they could be killed immediately.</p>
<p>Resulting from their partially-Shaaran heritage, the language of the same name became Sespech's primary language, which further led it to adopt Dethek as its alphabet. The citizenry also spoke the Sespechian tongue . A part of the Chessan language group , Sespechian was divided into at least four dialects, variously inspired by the languages of nearby non-humans, such as Surkh 's lizardmen , Hlondeth's yuan-ti, and the Shining Plains ' wemics .</p>
<p>Though it was Turmishan in origin, Sespech observed the Feast of the Moon at Highsummer .</p>
<p>The day of Highharvestide was one of added festivity in Sespech, as well as in the neighboring free cities . Known as the Rotting Dance , they all recognized it as a celebration of their freedom from Chondath's rule, even if the process had been so slow that attempts to exactly date it were unclear.</p>
<p>On the day of, most places of business were closed, but the exact customs observed during the Rotting Dance varied from city to city. Some preferred a solemn ceremony; others, the opposite. Nimpeth and Elupar , nearby city-states, were examples of the latter, throwing uncontrolled parties in celebration.</p>
<p>In particular, Sespech's Fort Arran was where Baron Foesmasher went to celebrate, delighting in the festivities with his soldiers.</p>
<p>Near the end of each year, during the last days of Alturiak , Sespech also celebrated the Feast of Purple Majesty . In honor of Baron Thuragar's accession, the festival was held in Ormpetarr, wherein the citizenry engaged in all sorts of celebration for three distinct and eventful days: the Dawn of Equines, the Flight of Dawn, and the Swordfest.</p>
<p>The first, the Dawn of Equines, involved competions of racing and jousting, as well as other methods of combat on horseback, until a winner was set for each. Their prize would come later that evening in the form of a seat at the baron's own table. The same reward was in place for the second day, the Flight of Dawn, though the competitions involved the throwing of darts, the hurling of slings, and even archery. Of the Feast's three days, The Swordfest came last. It was still impressive, however, for it involved a competition in martial skills and a non-lethal combat, the latter served as a true test for the abilities of the Vilhon Reach's best sword-wielders.</p>
<p>The nearby city-states of the Reach celebrated a number of other festivals, which the Sespechians also took part in.</p>
