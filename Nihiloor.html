<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Nihiloor's main activity was to create intellect devourers . It set them loose in Waterdeep, either in search for random targets to control or, occasionally, after specific targets such as members of the City Watch or City Guard . Individuals dominated by the intellect devourers then proceeded to act as spies for Nihiloor or, in specific cases, to capture and bring slaves or hostages to Skullport .</p>
