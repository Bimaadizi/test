<p>Shadoweir amulets were worn by members of Mielikkian knightly order of the Shadoweirs based in the High Forest .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Shadoweir amulets could only be used by druids and rangers who were members of the church of Mielikki . Each amulet possessed several charges, eight on average. The wearers of these amulets could call on the power of their goddess to cast entangle (consumed one charge), one with the land (two charges), and vine mine (three charges).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Shadoweir amulets were virtually unseen outside the Mielikkian faith. One such amulet was thought to have been taken off a dead Shadoweir by a doppelganger named Devalle , who assumed the slain ranger's identity in service of the Unseen and Eremuth Silverwind . Eventually, the doppelganger was slain by the Hero of Daggerford . The agents of the Unseen attempted to spring an unsuccessful ambush on the adventurer and companions outside the city of Elmwood in the Moonsea region.</p>
