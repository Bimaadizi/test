<p>Sharglar Dulrathran "The Lord of Beasts" was the Magister during 887 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>By the end of his tenure, Sharglar had accidentally turned himself into a half-man, half-beast.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He had been described as ambitious.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sharglar acquired his castle by seizing it from the Flaerin , dopplegangers that had filled the woods around them with monsters by means of deepspawn . The castle lay east of where Kurrsh was in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<p>Kurtal 's activities south of the Vilhon Reach eventually drew Sharglar's attention; the latter scried on him, and then challenged him after the Magister had just won a duel. Though Kurtal tried to escape, Sharglar used a tracer, following him into the location of one of the spellbooks belonging to Kurtal's apprentices, and slew him, acquiring the office of the Magister . Sharglar then killed the mage into whose abode they had teleported.</p>
<p>Sharglar then returned to his castle. Soon after becoming the Magister, an experimental spell transformed him such that he no longer had the hands to cast spells; months later, Kalgrathur Daycloaks would come across him and slay him.</p>
