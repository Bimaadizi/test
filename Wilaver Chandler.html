<p>Wilaver Chandler was an elder member of the extended Chandler family in the mid-1480s DR , who lived together in the Midler farmhouse near Eveningstar .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Wilaver was an older man with long white hair.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Wilaver was the father of Jandove and Graven , and husband of Caryn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar , the drow forces of Vicala Szind attacked the farmhouse and captured the entire family alive so that she could interrogate them about the Thread of the Weave . Unknown to the drow, the houseservant Maisby had escaped back to Eveningstar and sought help, getting first a pair of Purple Dragons and then a team of adventurers to investigate the farmhouse. Unfortunately, Vicala Szind had set all ten Midlers and Chandlers as part of a sacrificial life-draining spell, and the rescuers would have had to stealthily rescue each family member without Vicala noticing, lest she spitefully kill them.</p>
<p>Wilaver was kept in the cellar with his wife Caryn and grandson Thoben, guarded by drow warriors until their fate was decided.</p>
