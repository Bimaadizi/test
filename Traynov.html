<p>Traynov was a beast and monster trainer from Waterdeep circa 1490s DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Traynov was an accomplished man in his trade and was well known enough to be trusted by Laeral Silverhand , the Open Lord of Waterdeep, to reside in her manor and train her favorite new pet.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in the 1490s DR, Laeral Silverhand acquired a griffon hatchling and aimed at raising it as a loyal companion and pet. She contacted Traynov to raise and train the baby monstrosity after its initial imprinting on the Open Lord. Unbeknownst to Lord Silverhand, the Xanathar himself ( Zushaxx ) had his eyes on the beast. Xanathar's Thieves' Guild bribed Traynov for him to aid the rogues in kidnapping the baby griffin and promised to retrieve the trainer later to have him raise the griffon as the Thieves' Guild's fierce beast.</p>
