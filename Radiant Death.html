<p>Radiant Death was an epic powerful magical katana from Kara-Tur that may have appeared in Faerûn in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Radiant Death was the personal weapon of the famed warrior Viromoto , who fought a hundred duels and was victorious each time. However, he slowly came to mistrust Radiant Death , until he ultimately switched to another weapon for one fateful duel in which he suffered his first, and final, defeat.</p>
<p>Circa 1372 DR , Radiant Death was in the hands of a creature called Gargamesh in Cania in the Nine Hells .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The weapon was incredibly well-crafted and razor-sharp, yet felt almost too light. It had a dark and jagged blade.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>It was a +6 keen katana that dealt more devastating injuries when it scored critical strikes on foes. However, it felt so light in weight that even a weapon master found it difficult to wield effectively. This greatly impeded their ability to defend themselves. It was also highly exclusive: only a weapon master could wield it, and only a weapon master focused in the katana would use it.</p>
