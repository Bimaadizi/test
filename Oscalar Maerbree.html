<h2>Appearance</h2>

<h2>Personality</h2>

<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The man was a trader in wines. Around the turn from mid-to-late 14 th century DR , he'd come to deal in spiced cheeses and herbal cordials.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He had younger brothers in Neverwinter , and a family in the wine business. Taern Hornblade rather disliked him, considering him a crude boor that should not be so successful in his amorous pursuits.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Oscalar Maerbree was a trader in wines. Originally from a family in the business from Neverwinter, he'd been sent to Silverymoon by his father around 1349 DR . At least once, he had tried to bed Alustriel Silverhand , but he had not been able to get her drunk enough.</p>
<p>He became the prime suspect in 1369 DR regarding the murder of Garthin Muirtree , as a double of him was the last person seen to be entering and then leaving the room before Garthin was murdered. He was interrogated by Alustriel Silverhand over this matter almost immediately, and denied having met with the man. Despite the guards and a page agreeing they'd brought him to the Red Griffon Room where the murder took place and back out of it, he insisted there was a note he burned where the deceased postponed their moot. Summoning all the pages, one of them readily admitted to delivering that note, which had been placed on his tray to deliver.</p>
<p>Satisfactorily establishing they had not met on the day of the murder, Alustriel became convinced of his innocence. She gave him two deep kisses, which got him to promise not to talk about the murder.</p>
