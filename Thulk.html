<p>Thulk was a male bugbear barbarian slave from Szith Morcane . He ruled the slaves of Szith Morcane with an iron fist under the approval of his drow masters.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Physically, Thulk appeared to be a very strong example of his kind . He customarily wore leather armor and kept a morningstar to hand.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Not just physically imposing, Thulk was also renowned for his strong and imposing personality. Able to cow the rest of the goblinoid and even the stone giant slaves in Szith Morcane, his ability to keep the other slaves in check earned him the tentative backing of the drow . Thulk's cruelty could rival the drow when needed and he was intimidating enough to keep even giants in order. Despite this, Thulk was not above negotiating with those he recognized as stronger than him, at least until he judged them weak enough to be killed off.</p>

<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Thulk was denied any form of magical or finely crafted equipment owing to his station as a slave.
