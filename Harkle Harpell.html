<p>Harkle Harpell was a wizard and member of the Harpell family who lived in the small town of Longsaddle in the Savage Frontier in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the Companions of the Hall entered Longsaddle in the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR , Harkle was one of the first Harpells to greet the heroes.</p>
<p>Over the following years, Harkle traveled more than most of his family members, such as visiting Mithral Hall and helping to defend it against the drow invasion in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , fighting in the Battle of Keeper's Dale .</p>
<p>One of Harkle's accident-free successful spells was his fog of fate , which transported the caster wherever they needed to be to accomplish their goals. Upon casting the spell in the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR , Harkle ended up in the middle of the Sea of Swords , but was saved by the crew of the Sea Sprite . With them, Captain Deudermont , Drizzt Do'Urden , and Catti-brie , he sailed the Sword Coast for a time. While on this adventure, Harkle worked together with Captain Deudermont's ship wizard Robillard on several occasions. Notably, when the crew encountered a small swarm of zombies , Harkle demonstrated a new variation, Bigby's snapping digits wherein the conjured hand powerfully flicked its targets away.</p>
<p>While still under the effects of the fog of fate spell, he magically transported the Sea Sprite and crew to Impresk Lake in Carradoon . As a drawback of the fog of fate spell, when it expired, Harkle was drawn back to Longsaddle with his memories of the adventure erased from his mind.</p>
