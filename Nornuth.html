<p>Nornuth was a horse breeder and a stable master in the town of Espar in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nornuth was the town's horse breeder by the Year of the Spur, 1348 DR . Following the Battle of Hunter's Hollow that same year, Nornuth, along with his friends Thorl Battlestorm and Barth the Barrelhead , discussed the newly celebrated hero who famously saved King Azoun Obarskyr IV 's life. Nornuth complimented the young man on his knowledge of forests, ranger skills, and his good looks. Promptly, his friends compared the heroic Florin Falconhand to young Nornuth, who was just as popular among women and had numerous consorts in the old days. Imsra Skydusk , Florin's mother, joined that conversation, voicing worries about her son's future.</p>
