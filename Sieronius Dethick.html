<p>Sieronius Dethick was a milky-skinned drow priest of Vhaeraun turned vampire .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Sieronius was, by his own admission, thoroughly evil even prior to undeath .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was married in the distant past, though he assumed his wife was long dead by the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Sieronius Dethick's wedding ring was still among the vampire's possessions. The ring possessed potent enchantments and could be used to break Sieronius's curse if he had a willing or unwilling bride. He also possessed the legendary unique magic Staff of Konash .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>While on a mission on the surface of Faer√ªn , Sieronius was captured by the warrior- wizard Sunder Halyndliam . Sunder imprisoned Sieronius in the dungeons beneath his stronghold, drained of all his blood, and forced him to ingest a cursed substance that transformed him into a vampire . The only way to break the curse was for Sieronius's wife to free him.</p>
<p>By 1372 DR, Sunder Halyndliam was long dead, and the settlement of Liam's Hold had been built atop the remains of his stronghold. Sieronius stalked the hamlet's inhabitants to find a suitable new wife for him to kill, raise from the dead, and finally break his curse. He targeted Nell Kirschtorte , but was scared off by the baker's daughter, young sorceress Jemmy Kirschtorte . Eventually, Sieronius successfully captured Xanda Pennywell , a weaver from Liam's Hold. The fate of the drow vampire remained unclear, however. Some claimed he was slain by the Hero of Daggerford who was investigating the seamstress' disappearance. Other said the vampire claimed Xanda as his mesmerized unwilling wife and gained freedom. Some even suggested the Hero brought a gloomy young woman from Daggerford - Lula Redcap , for the vampire to take as his wife in exchange for Xanda Pennywell's life.</p>
