<h2>History</h2>
<p>Daxiong developed these magical devices sometime circa 1372 DR, as a side project during his obsessive research of zombification rituals. He was ready to gift these items to individuals who provided the necromancer with helpful information for his research. For example, the demon blood could be used as an arcane adhesive to strengthen zombie joints, staving rot, and decay. Such knowledge was precious to Daxiong.</p>
