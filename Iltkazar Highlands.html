<p>The Iltkazar Highlands were the eastern principality of the Kingdom of Tethyr .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The eastern Highlands sloped upwards to the chain of mountains that included the Snowflake , Omlarandin , and Alimir Mountains . The land was rough and uneven, a prime example being the Gorge of the Fallen Idol , where the River Ith began.</p>
<p>The Upper Highlands were designated as the Golden Marches ; the Lower Highlands made up the Duchy of Suretmarch .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The official ruler of the Principality of the Iltkazar Highlands was Prince Coram Rhindaun . As he was still an infant, the Monarch's Champion, Vander Stillhawk , ruled in his stead.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Historically, this region of Tethyr was less civilized than the western areas of that country. Monsters were a problem in the area, and many armies marched through its lands in times past.</p>
<p>In the month of Ches , in the Year of the Tankard (1370 DR) , the Amnian settlements of Trailstone and Riatavin succeeded from Amn to join Tethyr. Since Riatavin was a bustling and rich metropolis, its inclusion in the Upper Highlands boosted the Iltkazar Highlands from the poorest to the richest territory of Tethyr.</p>
