<p>Tempertuppin's Ever-Throwers were enchanted slings that magically produced their own bullets .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Tempertuppin's Ever-Throwers possessed a +1 enchantment, and similarly to the weapon that inspired them, magically materialized bullets that were engulfed in flames and exploded upon reaching the target.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These slings were created by Bindle "Eye-nock" Tempertuppin , who claimed he witnessed a fire giant using a similar weapon but "big enough to throw a donkey 300 paces". He, however, did not appreciate anyone questioning this and usually responded humorously with "you'll be sorry when a giant puts YOUR ass in a sling."</p>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR , Tempertuppin's slings could be found in Neverwinter and the Moonsea region.</p>
