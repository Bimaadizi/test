<p>The Lair of the Mad Dragon was the name given to the network of caverns located beneath the Sanatorium of Helm's Hold on the Sword Coast North . They served as the lair of the mad green dragon Chartilifax , protector of the Hex Locus and servant of the Prophet Rohini .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The walls and floors of the caves were unnatural in appearance, as if they were formed from stone that had been recently mined. Much of the dragon's lair resembled a swamp, with streams of blood-colored saltwater than flowed up the rocky walls and warped plant life that was alien to underground terrain.</p>
<p>The cave walls were illuminated by luminescent rock formations, and dimly-luminescent fungus.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Chartilifax's lair was located beneath the Sanatorium of the Cathedral of Helm in Helm's Hold .It could be accessed by the lower dungeons that lay beneath the cathedral's underground crypts.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>Warped trees grew within the Lair of the Mad Dragon, forming at angles that were not typically found among natural plant life.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Siege of Helm's Hold , just following the downfall of the Prophet Rohini in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the Heroes of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge ventured into the catacombs beneath the Cathedral of Helm into the Lair of the Mad Dragon. They massacred the scattered Ashmadai cultists that lingered within, and put an end to Chartilifax's madness and slew him as well.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The plaguechanged Chartilifax roamed his caverns in his humanoid form, taking on the appearance of a green elf . While he would cautiously observe anyone while under this guise, it was only a matter of time before he transformed into his true draconic form and demonstrate how his caverns were ideal hunting grounds for a green dragon.</p>
<p>There was at least one mimic that dwelled within a rocky alcove hidden behind a collapsible cavern wall.</p>
