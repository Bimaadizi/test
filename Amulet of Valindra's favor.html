<p>Amulet of Valindra's favor were enchanted amulets and cloak clasps that were created to be boons for Valindra Shadowmantle 's most loyal servants in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The wearers of the amulets received boosts to their vitality, ability to land lucky devastating strikes, accuracy, and constitution. When an amulet of Valindra's favor was worn together with a belt of Valindra's guard and a shard of Valindra's crown , the amulet greatly fortified the wearer's resistance to enthralling and controlling spells and, in turn, strengthened the wearer's own such spells.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These amulets were given out to Valindra Shadowmantle's lieutenants as a sign of favor. Despite their empowering magics, Valindra could use the amulets to strangle those lieutenants who displeased her. After Valindra's defeat by the defenders of Neverwinter in the late 15 th century DR, some of these amulets were recovered from the villains' bodies.</p>
