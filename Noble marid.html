<p>Noble marids were powerful masters of the oceans.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Noble marids had pearls for teeth and currents for muscles, making them the strongest and handsomest of all geniekind . Their hair was usually dark grey or blue-black. These genies could assume gaseous (fog), liquid (rushing current), and solid (gigantic humanoid ) forms.</p>
<p>Both sexes wore the most expensive clothes and jewels that they could afford. They enjoyed intimidating others with their impressive physiques.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Noble marids could cast the following spells as if they were highly powerful archmages : detect evil and good , detect invisibility , detect magic , invisibility , assume liquid form , polymorph self , purify water , gaseous form , part water , lower water , wall of fog , water breathing , airy water , control weather , cone of cold , solid fog , water blast , and maelstrom .</p>
<p>All noble marid had the innate ability to walk on water.</p>
<p>Noble marids were comfortable at any water temperature and were immune to any water- and most cold-based attacks. Steam did not affect them. They were more susceptible to fire-based attacks.</p>
<h2>Habitat/Society</h2>
<p>Noble marids served the Great Padisha of the Marids directly. Most schemed to rule upon her death. Noble marids usually ignored their lesser cousins unless they believed a direct benefit could be achieved to boost their standing in the court, called the Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls .</p>
<p>Noble marids traveled in groups that included other noble marids, marids, sea creatures, dragon turtle mounts, and other servants from the Elemental Plane of Water .</p>
<p>Marid war parties were led by one noble marid.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Noble marids impacted the other races less than other noble genies since they viewed other beings as inconsequential. Noble marids focused on themselves and had little time for anything else.</p>
<p>Noble marids who were enslaved by sha'irs stopped at nothing to get revenge against the sha'ir upon gaining their freedom.</p>
