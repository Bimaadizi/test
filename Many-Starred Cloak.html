<p>The Many-Starred Cloak , sometimes called the Order of the Many-Starred Cloak , was a guild of arcane magic users in the city of Neverwinter on the Sword Coast North in the 14 th and late 15 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Many-Starred Cloak was known as a band of mages who dedicated themselves to Neverwinter and who helped to defend the city and support its rulers with their spells . It was widely believed that they were the true power in Neverwinter as of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR. During this time, they provided blastglobes to the city's militia , and were seen as the only group that ensured Neverwinter's safety against the Arcane Brotherhood of Luskan , who otherwise would destroy or conquer Neverwinter.</p>
<p>The mages were able to come together to jointly cast and combine great spells that neared the mighty lost magics of Myth Drannor . They had done this several times, and had once sunk an entire island.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The guild's headquarters were found at the Cloaktower (later written as Cloak Tower), which served as their meeting place and seat of power, and as their fortress when they had to defend themselves. It was located in Neverwinter's Castle District prior to the Spellplague and in the Tower District after. The leadership of the guild briefly moved to an enclave in Beorunna's Well during the Wailing Death .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Members of the Many-Starred Cloak were, of course, known for their colorful and whimsical cloaks .</p>
<p>They were also known to have many magic items and treasures in their possession, and to seek out and collect powerful and unique Netherese artifacts, such as the Ruinstone —capable of altering reality to undo the wielder's mistakes —and Halavar's Universal Pantograph —a room-sized and highly complex device which could magically duplicate any item placed within it, and which was used only when the need was great for fear that its power could be depleted.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Many-Starred Cloak was well established in Neverwinter by the 1350s DR. During the latter half of the 14 th century DR, they were considered to be the true rulers of Neverwinter, but were nonetheless strong supporters of Lord Nasher Alagondar and were active in Neverwinter's defense. Prior to them, a powerful cabal of mages known as the Covenant had operated out of Neverwinter between the 7 th and the 12 th centuries DR.</p>
<p>When the Spellplague struck in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , the Cloaktower was dragged into the Far Realm , taking many of the Many-Starred Cloak mages with it. The Tower itself returned to the city only six months later, but appeared in a different location with no trace of the wizards save for their colorful cloaks—which would come to life to attack intruders. Meanwhile, the Far Realm twisted and warped the mages, but at least four of them survived—led by Gyrion Farseeker —and ultimately returned to Neverwinter in the late 15 th century DR. Angered by what they saw as an illegitimate successor to Nasher Alagondar in the form of Dagult Neverember , they formed the Cloaked Ascendancy and tried to take the city from him by force.</p>
<p>The Order of the Many-Starred Cloak was restored in the late 15 th century DR, and played an important role in Dagult Neverember's efforts to reclaim and rebuild Leilon by tearing down the magics of the High Tower of Thalivar . However, the Order also conspired to claim the magic of the Tower for themselves, and placed a powerful mage named Gallio Elibro in charge of researching and rebuilding the Tower.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, the Many-Starred Cloak comprised goodly mages, many of whom were secretly Harpers . At least fifteen of the Many-Starred Cloak members were extremely powerful wizards.</p>
