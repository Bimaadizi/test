<p>Nature's scythes were once dreadful magic weapons of war left behind by the creatures of the Army of Darkness after the Weeping War .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nature's scythes were crudely made weapons that usually looked like they were assembled using a gnarled branch of an old oak tree and a terrifying-looking rough finish blade of cold iron .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This exotic weapon possessed a +1 enchantment but was especially powerful when wielded against humans , making it a +4 enchantment.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nature's scythes dated back to the Weeping War and were left behind in the great forest of Cormanthor by the creatures under Malimshaer 's and Gaulguth 's leadership. The evil scythes were left among the debris of battle alone for centuries as the pure nature's effects on the items leached the evil essence out of the enchanted magic. Circa 1372 DR Nature's scythes could be found along the Sword Coast , often in possession of Chauntea 's devotees with no taint of evil magics remaining on the items.</p>
