<p>Powderkegs were a type of small keg used to store and transport either gunpowder or smokepowder .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Powderkegs were constructed of wood and unlike powder horns they were not waterproof. They could hold up to 15​ to ​20 pounds (6.8​ to ​9.1 kilograms) of either powder. As a firearm typically required 1 oz (28 g) gunpowder or smokepowder to be reloaded, this meant that a powderkeg held enough for most firearms to take 240 shots.</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>Gunpowder and smokepowder were typically sold within either powder horns or powderkegs.</p>
