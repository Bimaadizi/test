<p>The Swordspoint neighborhood of Ravens Bluff was a modest collection of residences, shops, and other noted landmarks of the city's Temple District . While it lacked the luxury and opulence of say Holyhouses or Altarside , it was a popular destination for Ravenians with many notable and fascinating sights.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>This region of Ravens Bluff earned its name from the great number of duels that were once fought on its streets (though, as of 1370 DR , these had been banned within the city). The five-way intersection of roads on the northwestern corner of De Villars Park was known as "Bloody Boots" for the bloody footprints of a victorious duelist that long stained the streets.</p>
