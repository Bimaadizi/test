<p>Bloomridge Park was a public park located in the Bloomridge neighborhood of the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Bloomridge Park was a small park nestled against the Old Wall , just east of the Manor Gate . The Park had one main entrance â€“ a large gate in the park's metal fence on the park's southwestern side. Another entrance, a smaller gate, was located on the eastern side with the groundskeeper's quarters adjacent.</p>
<p>The park opened into a paved plaza with a statue of Balduran . It extended away from the main gate into a round risen area built around an old tree. Pathways extended away from the plaza with a gazebo to the left of the entrance, a small pond further in towards the Old Wall, and an area with wall-carved fountains straight across the main entrance at the Old Wall. The park's paths were decorated with statues carved by Stoney and Boney , two elementals from the Circus of the Last Days . The statues were "A Tribute to Liberty."</p>
<p>Various medicinal plants and fungi could be found growing throughout the park, such as balsam , autumncrocus , swarming toadstools , weavemoss , mugwort , rogue's morsels , belladonna , and others. Some of the trees in the park house honey-filled wild bee combs.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The park was open to public and was maintained by a groundkeeper who was responsible for clearing paths off fallen branches, polishing benches, cleaning the ponds, raking leaves, exterminating pests, repainting of signage, as well as locking and unlocking the gates daily.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
