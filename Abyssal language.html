<p>The abyssal language was the language of demons .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was a form of the Primordial language warped and twisted by the evil of the Abyss .</p>
<h2>Sound</h2>
<p>Lower-ranking demons spoke using sounds like the barking of canines, while the speech of more refined demons sounded like softly droning ocean waves mingled with the violence of a swarm of angry hornets. As with everything involving the tanar'ri , however, their speech was unpredictable, and sometimes an elite balor's words were rougher or a lowly bar-lgura's words smoother.</p>
<h2>Script</h2>
<p>Abyssal used the Infernal language's script or the Barazhad alphabet.</p>
