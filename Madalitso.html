<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , during the time Captain Grisly was replaced by the green hag Auntie Ethel as the owner of the Blushing Mermaid, Madalitso and Nafula could often be found in the tavern's second-floor taproom. At that time, Madalitso was trying to convince Nafula to marry someone for the family's financial well-being, yet Nafula was opposed to an arranged marriage without love. However, for the family's sake and with some convincing, she was open to at least meeting the suitor before turning him down completely.</p>
