<p>Dark chocolate cherry cake was a type of quality pastry, not surprisingly, made using cherries and dark chocolate , found in the city of Ravens Bluff in the Vast in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dark chocolate cherry cake was among many pastries created at Polly's All Night Pastry Emporium , caf√©, and catering business in Ravens Bluff. In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Sorduel Meytauc of the Ill Eagle Inn , bought out Polly's pastries to pass them as his own in a competition at Mossbridges 's First Annual Year-End Festival . "Coincidentally," Polly's own invitation to partake in the competition disappeared at the same time. Sorduel Meytauc entered Polly's dark chocolate cherry cake but did not win the competition due to being found out and embarrassed by a group of adventurers of the Living City.</p>
