<p>Dlaedra was a woman of Hastarl in the early 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>In the 229Â DR , Thelorn Selemban insinuated during the start of an unfriendly meet with Jansibal Otharr at the Kissing Wench , a tavern of Hastarl , that Dlaedra was unimpressed with his "rampant glory", almost certainly an anatomical reference. These insinuations strongly implied Dlaedra was a woman.</p>
