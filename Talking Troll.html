<p>The Talking Troll was a rundown tavern located in the town of Triboar in the Savage Frontier in the mid-to-late 14 th and late 15 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>While it had always been poor quality, decades of neglect saw it literally falling apart by the late 1400s DR. Sometime after 1485 DR , part of the roof had burned and the hole wasn't repaired for at least two years. This allowed birds to come in, make nests in the beams, and leave their droppings on the furniture and floors</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>It smelled bad, was poorly illuminated, had low beams overhead, and was stuffed with a hodgepodge of over-large, well-worn, second-hand furniture. The least amount of effort and care were put into its maintenance and upkeep in the late 1400s DR.</p>
<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
<p>Naturally, the Talking Troll was a complete dive by the standards of Waterdeep . Its patrons were drunkards just as old and ramshackle as its furniture.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Despite its many flaws, the Troll boasted a wide variety of ales , lagers, and stouts from its abundant cellar.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , the owner of the Talking Troll fled Triboar following a scandal. It was then "inherited" by Kaelen Sarssir , an aspiring thespian, by 1485 DR. He sought to remake the tavern as a playhouse, but lacked the necessary resources, as well as the necessary initiative. He spoke of his plans with new patrons, in the hopes of enticing one to donate or become a sponsor or even a partner.</p>
<h2>Patrons</h2>
<p>After he was regrettably assigned to the post of the Allfaiths Shrine in Red Larch , a priest of Helm named Silvarren Loomshank delayed his journey in Triboar, and spent his time getting deliriously drunk and racking up a bar tab in the Talking Troll.</p>
