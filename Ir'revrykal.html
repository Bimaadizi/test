<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Legendary history</h3>
<p>Legend has it that Ir'revrykal was forged by the githyanki wizard -smith Ir'mlar , hundreds of years before the 14 th century DR . It was rumored to have been smithed in the darkened caverns below the city of Tu'narath , an unholy city that floated on the Astral Plane upon "the One in the Void", a long-dead deity.</p>
<p>To craft the sword, the mlar used the bones of the One in the Void, an unknown substance to the Prime Material plane . The wizard-smith then imbued the weapon with an evil entity claimed to be a prince of the lower plane of Carceri . Some claimed, however, that the greatsword contained the One in the Void's spirit, which had been banished to within the blade for crimes committed against other gods aeons ago.</p>
<h3>Later history</h3>
<p>The sword was later relocated to the continent of Faer√ªn , on Toril . Specifically, the greatsword made its way to a githyanki compound in the Watcher's Keep in Amn , sometime during or before the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR .</p>
