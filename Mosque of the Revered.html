<p>The Mosque of the Revered was a temple in Dihliz dedicated to the worship of Kor in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The facade of the mosque was slightly worn and faded, despite its prestigious location near the Ivory Palace .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>In 1367 DR the mosque was supported almost entirely by donations from visitors from the Cities of the Pantheon . Kor did not have a strong following in Dihliz when compared to Selan , meaning the mosque often fell into financial hardship. Because of this, priests of Kor would bestow their spells on anyone making a sizable donation without hesitation or questioning their motives.</p>
