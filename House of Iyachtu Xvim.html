<p>The House of Iyachtu Xvim was a temple dedicated to Iyachtu Xvim in the Thayan city of Bezantur , the so-called "City of a Thousand Temples."</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple was located in eastern-central Bezantur and was adjacent to the Temple of Sharess .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The temple was one of the largest in Bezantur. It comprised a grand central hall with two long wings containing shrines as well as sleeping, dining, and storage facilities for the temple's residents. A dozen smaller buildings also occupied the temple grounds, some of which served as housing for higher-ranked priests while others hosted various Xvimlar ceremonies.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The House's congregation was one of the most enthusiastic in the city, and was known to brawl in the streets with followers of Cyric from the nearby House of Cyric .</p>
<p>Xvim himself was known to visit the temple and lead ceremonies.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The House of Iyachtu Xvim was constructed in the late 1360s DR as part of a push to dedicate temples to Xvim throughout Thay. The House was immediately somewhat unique among temples to Xvim as most of his places of worship were underground and/or former temples to Bane .</p>
<p>With the opening of the temple, tensions with the House of Cyric swiftly escalated as it was Xvim's aspiration to usurp Cyric's divine portfolio . The two temples engaged in acts of assassination and magical assaults against each other.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In the late 1360s DR, the high priestess of the temple was Dienje Xavarri , a fanatic who was also widely considered second only to Xvim himself as the head of Xvim's church in Thay.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>As baneguards were popular servants at Xvim's Thayan temples, it was likely that the House of Iyachtu Xvim was involved in creating and using them.</p>
