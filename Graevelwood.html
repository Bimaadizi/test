<p>Graevelwood was an isolated gnomish clanhold located underneath a rocky crag in the eastern reaches of the Arn Forest in the Silver Marches .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Clanlord Mavheran Haerlskeel believed a war with orcs was not something she wanted to get her clan involved with so she kept her community's location a secret.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The settlement did little trading with Deadsnows and Citadel Adbar , but always with as much secrecy as possible. The traders were always careful to cover up their tracks so their path could not be followed back to the clan.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Many of the folk living in Graevelwood were known for their skill in trapping.</p>
