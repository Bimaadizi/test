<p>The Zhentilar were the standing army of Zhentil Keep .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Zhentilar were formed sometime after the death of Zhentar in 753 DR as a group loyal to his vision. It was in response to the event in Zhentil Keep known as the Night Plague in 882 DR , that the group was expanded to form something similar to a an official army. The Zhentilar continued to expand with the rapid growth of the Keep to become one of the largest militaries in the Moonsea . The Zhentilar were ultimately disbanded after the destruction of Zhentil Keep and the Zhentilar base of the Citadel of the Raven by the shadovar sometime between 1376 DR and 1479 DR</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Zhentilar numbered around 22,000 soldiers plus an additional 16,000 mercenaries in 1358 DR . Only about 5,000 troops were actually stationed within Zhentil Keep, with the rest garrisoned in the Citadel of the Raven and along the Long Road to Riches .</p>
