<h2>History</h2>
<h3>The Battle of Bones and the Keep of Pale Night</h3>
<p>Mordoc, after becoming the king of the vampires, led his army of vampires, nightwalkers , and nightshades into the Battle of Bones , where they began to thrive. Just outside, or at the edge, of the battlefield, Mordoc built the Keep of Pale Night where his vampire servants lived with him. At one time, the assassin Karne was sent to slay him, but Mordoc defeated Karne in battle and appeared to kill him instead. Karne however, had found his mortal enemy and had feigned his death.</p>
<p>Mordoc then pledged his allegiance to Eldrith the Betrayer, though his true masters lay in Mulhorand . Mordoc's ultimate goal was to destroy the city of Baldur's Gate and through Eldrith, he hoped to achieve this. He assisted Eldrith by supplying the troops of the Dark Alliance . Later, an agent of Karne in Xantam 's thieves guild posed as a servant of Eldrith and tricked him into building for him the Orb of the Undead , which was used to animate the dead in the Crypts of Ilmater in Baldur's Gate.</p>
<h3>The Onyx Tower</h3>
<p>When Vahn , Kromlech , and Adrianna killed Eldrith and used a shadow gate to escape the Onyx Tower , Mordoc was overjoyed as he was now the ruler of the Onyx Tower. Mordoc informed his allies in Mulhorand of the delay and informed them of his plan to move the Onyx Tower to Baldur's Gate to destroy the city.</p>
<p>When the Harpers activated all the elemental foundations to activate the tower and thus hope to seal it, Mordoc gained access to the tower. However, Karne discovered Mordoc's plan and with his enemies, the Harpers Jherek , Dorn Redbear , Allessia Faithhammer , Ysuran Auondril , Borador Goldhand , and Vhaidra Uoswiir , the Keep of Pale Night was infiltrated.</p>
<p>Karne then freed Vahn, Kromlech, and Adrianna from Mordoc's holds and with Jherek, he stayed behind to fend off Mordoc's zombies , mummies , and shadow creatures. The eight adventurers fought Mordoc and bested him in battle causing him, weakened, to flee and move the Onyx Tower to Baldur's Gate.</p>
<h3>Mordoc's Gate</h3>
<p>Mordoc used the Onyx Heart to transform the citizens of Baldur's Gate into zombies under his control, while his vampires transformed other citizens into vampires. The soldiers outside of Baldur's Gate launched a desperate attack against the undead. Mordoc renamed Baldur's Gate to Mordoc's Gate and to allow his allies from Mulhorand to enter the Onyx Tower, he added an entrance to it. While it took the eight adventurers, Karne and Jherek about a month to enter Mordoc's Gate, their appearance changed the tide of the battle.</p>
<p>Karne and Jherek assisted the soldiers of Baldur's Gate in their battle against the zombies, while Dorn Redbear defeated the vampiric form of Randalla Brasshorn , the lieutenant of Mordoc's general Xanhast . The eight adventurers then entered the Onyx Tower through its newly added entrance, a small weakness that would bring his downfall. They advanced through the Onyx Tower and eventually through the final shadow gate, which had been restructured to go to the Plane of Shadow .</p>
<p>The eight adventurers once again battled Mordoc, who had become nearly as powerful as a god. But they managed to kill him, leaving one of them entitled to the leadership of the Onyx Tower. However, they decided to destroy the Onyx Heart, which in turn broke the elemental foundations, destroying the Onyx Tower and restoring Baldur's Gate to the way it was.</p>
<h3>Legacy</h3>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, Mordoc's bust was displayed in the manse of Cazador Szarr , a vampire lord , and a patriar of Baldur's Gate.</p>
