<p>Starmantle , referred to as the Ruins of Starmantle during the century that followed the Spellplague , was once a small, coastal city that was located on the Dragon Coast , up until the late 14 th century DR , and resettled in the late 15 th century DR.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Following its destruction, the ruins of the city and the surrounding landscape were covered by large, man-sized, gemstone-hard, emerald-colored outcrops that hummed with a single flute-like note. A flickering blue glow passed between the outcrops and obsidian masses slowly drifted across the open ground.</p>
<p>Starmantle had an analogous city in the Shadowfell known as Elgrin Fau .</p>
<p>After being resettled, Starmantle was a village that grew around a caravan stop and a general store.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The city was linked to the town of Reddansyr and the Trader's Road , by means of the Trader's Road .</p>
<p>The fortress of Stormwatch was located to Starmantle's west, situated between it and the large city of Westgate .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Beginning in the Year of the Black Blazon, 1382 DR , Starmantle was inundated by flood of Shou humans from Thesk .</p>
<p>Starmantle was destroyed in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR by the Spellplague , when a conflagration of blue fire shot forth from a portal and ravaged the city. Just over a decade later, the city was little more than ruins.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, Starmantle became a small village that grew around a caravan stop and a tent city in the city's ruins after an inn was built and a humble general store opened next to a warehouse.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
