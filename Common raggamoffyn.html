<p>Common raggamoffyns were a variation of raggamoffyn composed of leather cloaks , gloves, and bits of armor . As their name suggested, they were the most common form of raggamoffyn encounted in Undermountain and Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>All raggamoffyns attempted to envelop potential victims in order to control them. If successful, the parts of the raggamoffyn clung to the victim in a skin-tight sheath from head to toe. The raggamoffyn usually created a hood to cover the victim's face as well. Once enveloped, a victim was forced to do the raggamoffyn's bidding until the creature was done with them or they were able to resist the creature's control.</p>
<p>Common raggamoffyns usually attempted to control human -sized targets. Targets who temporatily escaped their control risked being asphyxiated.</p>
