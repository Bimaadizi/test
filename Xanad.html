<p>Xanad was an evil Netherese arcanist who developed numerous spells , from simple cantrips to the most potent power words.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Xanad was a merciless man who, unlike most other arcanists, did not live in a settlement or enclave. Instead, he chose to live in the wilderness of Netheril's Frontier. If anyone tried to approach him, whether they be the Earlanni elves or those seeking to learn his spells, he would quickly dispatch them.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Earlanni disdained Xanad, considering him to be an infuriating invader. They were known to send out mercenaries to do battle with him, particularly during the last ten years of his life.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Xanad was born in 2886 NY (−973 DR) . During his life, he developed many spells, starting with audible glamer when he was 29 years old. 170 years later, he had a breakthrough and developed the first power word, power word, blind and then shout within the same decade. Xanad then developed message and power word, stun , and finally, power word, kill in 3176 NY (−683 DR) . During the year he developed this final spell, his fortress was destroyed by a group of over thirty hirelings. Strangely, his body was never found in the wreckage.</p>
