<p>Sharrven was an ancient elven realm in the southern High Forest .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The realm was renown for its tolerance, and was made up mostly of moon elves and green elves .</p>
<p>Sharrven's architecture was likened to that found in Silverymoon . Many buildings were made of stone and bore massive perches on which a dragon could alight.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>At its height, Sharrven encompassed the High Forest south of the Star Mounts .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The Elders of Sharrven steered the realm. Much of their focus in the early millennia of Sharrven's existence was dedicated to keeping the ambitions of the gold elves of Siluvanede in check, and preventing them from repeating the mistakes of ancient Aryvandaar . They were known to confer with baelnorns located at Nithrithvinae's Tomb .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Sharrven boasted a mighty military which included gold and silver dragon mounts as well as exceptionally powerful wizards .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sharrven was founded in -7600 DR by moon elves from Evereska , seeking to escape the overcrowded city, as well as moon elves (and a few sun elves ) from Siluvanede, seeking to counter the overbearing and arrogant nobles of that realm. Circa -4700 DR , nobles from Sharrven in turn split off to found another realm, Eaerlann , with the intent of opposing the ambitions of Siluvanede by claiming the ruins of Aryvandaar before they could. This was done largely with the blessing of Sharrven's Elders.</p>
<p>As tensions rose between Eaerlann and Siluvanede, the Seven Citadels' War broke out in -4500 DR . While Sharrven was at first content to support Eaerlann indirectly while the fledgling realm held its own, eventually the Siluvanedeen began to break into the ruins of Aryvandaar and equip themselves with Vyshaantar weapons. As the tide turned against Earlann, Sharrven joined the conflict in -4400 DR . Bringing their full military might to bear, Sharrven helped to end the war in -4300 DR , at which point Siluvanede was annexed into Eaerlann. While the war seemed won, Sharrven would remain a focus for revenge among the fey'ri of Siluvanede's House Dlardrageth .</p>
<p>The fey'ri would have their revenge in -2770 DR when they launched a surprise attack. They used their powers to create portals to send hordes of monsters directly into and all across Sharrven's territory. In what would come to be known as the Slaughter of Sharrven , the realm swiftly collapsed as the inhabitants fled to Evereska and Eaerlann, leaving behind only scattered outposts of their once great civilization. The rampaging monsters were eventually subdued by the forces of Ammarindar led by King Connar IV , although some of the beasts continued to propagate in the region for millennia. Regardless, by this time nearly all of Sharrven's settlements had been demolished.</p>
<p>The stretch of the High Forest which the realm once inhabited would continue to be called "Sharrven" into the Era of Upheaval ,</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The Srinshee claimed to have been raised in Sharrven, although many were unsure if this was the truth as of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
