<p>Airspur was the capital of Akanûl . The city was located on two cliffs facing a narrow bay. Many buildings were located on earthmotes that floated over the bay and were connected to each other and the cliffs by bridges. Although there were some human residents in Airspur, the majority of inhabitants were genasi with airsouls and stormsouls the most common variety.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to the Spellplague , Airspur was a city-state allied variously with Chessenta or Chondath . When the Spellplague struck in 1385 DR most of the genasi nation of Shyr was translocated from Abeir to Toril . The Spellplague opened the huge gorge that runs through the city and moved the Sea of Fallen Stars . Most of the population died during the catastrophe.</p>
<p>Around 1429 DR , Queen Cyndra led the survivors of Brassune to the Airspur, displacing its orc and half-orc inhabitants, and rebuilding the city into the new home of the displaced genasi .</p>
<p>As of the 1490s DR decade, the earth motes that made up Airspur still float, even after the Second Sundering caused others across Faerûn to fall.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Airspur was ruled by a hereditary monarch who was advised by a council of genasi, known as the Four Stewards . As of 1479 DR , the kinggdom was ruled by Queen Arathane . All important government positions were occupied by genasi.</p>
<h2>Military</h2>
<p>Airspur and Akanûl were defended by the elite Sky Guard , Ground Defense League and Wave Riders which formed the core of the military. Other troops were conscripted into the military when needed.</p>
<h2>Religion</h2>
<p>The genasi from Abeir were ruled by primordials and did not worship gods. They were slow to adopt the worship of Faerûn's gods and no temples existed in Airspur. The Steward of the Sea blocked construction of temples on the grounds that temples would take up space better used for other purposes.</p>
