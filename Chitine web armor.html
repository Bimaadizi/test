<p>Chitine web armor was a type of armor used on Toril .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Chitin web armor was a rare type of armor made from the hardened web of chitines . All chitines could create web armor for themselves and maintain it indefinitely. Nonchitines could pay chitine weavers to make web armor. This armor lasted for about three months before it started to deteriorate. After six months it would have completely dissolved. Chitine web armor (like all chitine web based products) was susceptible to fire. Web armor could also be built to resemble studded leather armor, by weaving metal studs into it.</p>
