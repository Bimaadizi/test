<p>Kensidan was the son of Rethnor , the leader of Ship Rethnor and one of the five High Captains of the city of Luskan .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kensidan came to prominence in 1377 DR when Captain Deudermont tried to free Luskan from the rule of the High Captains and the Arcane Brotherhood .</p>
<p>Kensidan, a very scheming individual, convinced his father that at first they should make no move against Deudermont in fighting against the Host Tower . Later, when Deudermont had won and was elected governor, Kensidan made an agreement with Bregan D'aerthe for assistance, and his father fomented the fury of the people against the governor for a famine that plagued the city.</p>
<p>Finally, Rethnor died, probably helped along by Kensidan. Kensidan started a open revolt that took control of Luskan and Kensidan himself killed Deudermont. Thus Luskan became, as Kensidan had always wanted, a true free port where it was possible buy all kind of tools, including slaves and drugs.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The nickname of Kensidan originated with the Cloak of the Crow , a magical cape that could polymorph a man into a giant crow .</p>
