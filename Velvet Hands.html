<p>The Velvet Hands were a thieves' guild in Hastarl in the ancient kingdom of Athalantar , led by the thief Farl .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 229 DR , however, a powerful gang, called the Moonclaws , emerged in Hastarl . In response, local thief Farl and his friend Eladar the Dark (secretly Elminster Aumar , prince of Athalantar ) formed a gang they called the Velvet Hands in opposition, with the other thieves Jhardin , Rhegaer , Chaslarla , Tarth , Larrin , and Tassabra . The origin of the name was a quote from Farl, context unknown. During the meeting, the thief Klaern Blaenbar and his brothers stormed out after he was refused leadership of the band.</p>
<p>Overnight, the gang killed the Blaenbar brothers, Klaern Blaenbar , Othkyn Blaenbar , and Korlar Blaenbar . The Moonclaws also attacked the Velvet Hands on the next night, killing Chaslarla, Jhardin and Rhegaer. The survivors decided to ambush the Moonclaws at the location of one of their next heists, in Athalgard ; there, however, Eladar slew a mage, and the Velvet Hands were pursued by a gargoyle that slew Larrin; they ended up surrounded by Moonclaws upon slaying it; Tarth was slain in turn, while Farl became separated from Tassabra and Eladar, then overwhelmed. Though the last two were able to escape to Ansildabar's Last Rest , Tassabra took mortal wounds. Eladar attempted to avenge the Velvet Hands, but stopped after being rescued from the Roost of the Moonclaws , where he targetted Isparla, by the Magister Dorgon Heamiiolothtar , who resurrected Tassabra and either rescued or resurrected Farl.</p>
<p>Eladar left the city soon after, leaving only two members of the gang. Farl had refounded the gang as a full-fledged thieves' guild by Year of the Chosen, 240 DR despite the fact he'd become a wealthy investor and trader in the intervening decade. He had his guild assist Elminster in his siege against the Magelords, by having his thieves filch spell components and magic items from Athalgard .</p>
