<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The pirate king lived in an elegant and luxurious house to the north-west of Brynnlaw , where he ruled. His house was always guarded, but if he was forced to come to arms, he fought with dual scimitars. He had connections with Spellhold and would send those there who were deemed to be mentally unstable, or those with a talent for magic.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Desharik fought with scimitars and wore studded leather armor , all of which were enchanted .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Desharik was once a pirate who roamed the Sea of Swords with his crew. He, however, had lost a naval battle against another pirate king. Given no other choice, he fled to Brynnlaw, which he subsequently invaded.</p>
<p>Desharik and his crew killed the mayor of Brynnlaw and many citizens. He forced the others onto the streets, or into courtesanship at Lady Galvena's Festhall . He "awarded" his lieutenant, Chremy , with the slave-courtesan Ginia , to please himself and his pirates.</p>
