<p>The River Arkhen , also known as the River Elzimmer , was a major river running through the Arkhen Vale in the Dalelands , down to Selgaunt Bay in Sembia .</p>
<p>The great city of Archenbridge , which also served as Archendale 's capital, gained its name from its position straddling the river over the eponymous Arkhen Bridge along the Dawnpost .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The River Arkhen rested in a deep gorge that cut through the Arkhen Vale. It was fed by the Arkhen Falls , which emerged from Mount Thalagbror , in the Thunder Peaks , and continued southeast between the Marching Mountains and the Arch Wood forest.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The original Arkhen Bridge, a stonework crossing which allowed travel over the River Arkhen, was originally erected around 1100 DR by a dwarven engineer by the name of Naiden Stonewright . In 1293 DR , a massive flood of the river destroyed all but its stone casements and the buttresses, which had been magically enchanted. A wooden bridge was built in its place, upon the foundation set in by the dwarf almost two centuries before.</p>
<p>Native Selgauntans always referred to this river as the Elzimmer after a long-dead water wizard .</p>
