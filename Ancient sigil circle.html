<p>Ancient sigil circles were runes inscribed throughout Faer√ªn that allowed for near-instantaneous travel from one point to another.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>When in use, a swirling black-and-violet vortex would form over the sigil. Anyone passing through the vortex would step directly to another sigil of their choosing, no matter the distance between them.</p>
<p>It was possible these sigil circles to malfunction. When this occurred, arcs of purple lightning would shoot out from the vortex. Individuals in transit could become 'stuck inside' the sigil, trapped unless someone else helped pull them through the vortex.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These sigils originated from the ancient empire of Netheril .</p>
<h2>Number and Locations</h2>
<p>There were over three dozen of these ancient sigil circles found across the Western Heartlands and the region of the Sword Coast around Baldur's Gate .</p>
