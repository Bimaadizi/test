<p>Qysari Rings was the title given to the various magical rings made especially for the rulers of the Shoon Imperium . The name comes from " qysar ", an ancient term for "emperor" that Amahl Shoon III , the first in a long line of imperial rulers, adopted for his title. The rings were a subset of the shoonrings , a more general term for magic rings made in the Shoon Imperium during the sixth age of Calimshan ( 27 â€“ 450 DR ), which had unique and distinguishing elements in their construction and enchantment. There were twelve known Qysari Rings , as documented by the scribe Rativ ym Shoon , a slave who described and cataloged the rings in the Year of the Errant Kings, 356 DR . This information was later presented in The Magics of the South by the Herald of Athkatla , Zatan Arrowswift , but either some of the descriptions have been lost to the ravages of time, or they are being kept secret, because only ten rings are described below and two of those have a questionable pedigree.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Each ring had different color metals twisted together in a raised zigzag pattern that flowed around the circumference of the ring. What distinguished Qysari Rings from other shoonrings and magic rings in general was the way they adjusted to the wearer when they were donned. A wizard saw no change in the design of the ring, but clerics , druids , and other priests saw the zigzag pattern change direction, flowing at right angles to the previous pattern, disappearing under one edge of the ring and emerging from the other edge. When warrior or rogue put on one of these rings, the raised lines of the ring flattened out as if melting to make a smooth band, but the zigzag pattern was still visible in the surface of the ring.</p>
