<p>The Sidewinder River was a twisting river found in Damara .</p>
<p>The name "Sidewinder" was occasionally also used to describe the River Lench to the southeast. The reason for this was that the two rivers collectively formed a clear border between Damara and Impiltur .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The river was too rough for most shipping. It was difficult to cross, making it a site of strategic importance.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Sidewinder was formed from glacial runoff from the Glacier of the White Worm at the southern end of the Galena Mountains . It flowed east from the glacier and along the northern border of both the Earthwood and the ridges of the Earthspur Mountains . It then flowed through Ravensburg before joining the Great Imphras River at Zarach .</p>
