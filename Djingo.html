<p>Djingo was a merchant from the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Djingo was a tan-skinned gold dwarf with brown eyes and trimmed thick black beard.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , as the city of Baldur's Gate shuddered under the Absolute crisis , certain goods started to become rare and expensive. One such material that skyrocketed in price was saltpeter . Djingo had a multi- barrel stash of saltpeter and he charged at least 500 gold pieces per barrel, a high price as the dwarf knew that once Baldur's Gate was besieged, he'd easily sell it for double the amount to the Gate's steel watcher foundry. Several purchasers engaged in a missing war for the barrels: Pheebs Splayfoot‎‎ , Kaet Ling , and Smiley Gheef . Gheef offered 700 gp per barrel, but the bidding war ended abruptly when Kaet Ling offered to pay 1,000 gp per barrel, in cash, no notes.</p>
