<p>Hammers of thunderbolts were powerful enchanted dwarven warhammers .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hammers of thunderbolts varied in design. Some were heft angular dwarven warhammers, while other were powerful mauls . Generally, a hammer of thunderbolts looked like an ordinary weapon of war, albeit heavier and of a larger size. Despite that, it was perfectly balanced.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Each hammer of thunderbolts possessed a true name and the weapon's real powers were only revealed to those who knew it. When swung in battle, each hit with the weapon unleashed great noise – clap of thunder, that could render the target stunned. These hammers could also be turned at the opponent, unleashing the same stunning thunder damage. Thankfully, its enchantments returned thrown hammer of thunderbolts back into the owner's hand.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Unteius "Stoneshoulders" Boldenbar , one of the eight Master Masons of Sarbreen , possessed a hammer of thunderbolts that had been passed down through his clan. His particular hammer was what gave Sarbreen the moniker "The City of the Hammer." It was lost somewhere in the Underdark as Unteius led Sarbreen's refugees to safety after the realm of Roldilar fell in the 7 th century DR .</p>
<p>One such mighty weapon was wielded in the Battle of the Drowning of Lornak . As of around the 1360 DR , a runestone in Delzoun written in Dethek was claimed to a give a clue to its whereabouts.</p>
<p>Some years before the late 14 th century DR, a powerful +3 variant of a hammer of thunderbolts was forged by the dwarven smith only known as Silverblade . He created the hammer as part of a set that also included a girdle of giant strength and gauntlets of ogre power . The items were intended to be a gift to his son, an officer in dwarven military who fought the menace of giants and ogres as the time. Unfortunately, Silverblade's son perished in battle before the smith could gift the set to him. Grief-stricken, Silverblade donned the set of the powerful items himself and set out to slay the giant-kin responsible for his son's death. Silverblade the smith perished shortly after in a blaze of battle glory. In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , this hammer of thunderbolts ended up in the slimy hands of a mind flayer colony that was recently founded in secrecy in the sewers of Athkatla , underneath the Temple District . If the hammer were to be joined with the rest of the set by a talented smith – gauntlets of ogre strength , a girdle of frost giant strength , with the use of a special enchantment formula scroll, that hammer of thunderbolts could be turned into a powerful weapon known as Crom Faeyr , especially deadly to giants.</p>
<p>Shortly before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , a dwarven smith named Barun recreated a powerful version of a hammer of thunderbolts , leading to numerous copies and variants of these weapons appearing across the Sword Coast .</p>
