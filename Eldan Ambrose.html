<p>Eldan Ambrose was an Amnian priest of Tempus who came to Battledale during the Time of Troubles .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Pilgrimage to Battledale</h3>
<p>The god Tempus came to Faerûn in a ruined castle in Battledale during the Time of Troubles in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR . Eldan and almost one-hundred of his followers rebuilt the castle, naming it the Abbey of the Sword . The Abbey of the Sword contained numerous portals in its many underground passages and entrances, and Eldan's followers took it upon themselves to guard them against intrusion.</p>
<h3>Drow Invasion</h3>
<p>In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , drow came through an unguarded portal deep in the tunnels of the Abbey. The Vhaeraun -worshiping drow of the Auzkovyn clan attacked Eldan and his followers, who fought fiercely, but ultimately lost. Eldan was devoured by a summoned demon , and the drow escaped into the forest of Cormanthor , opening another portal to bring more of their kin to Faerûn. The defenders of the Abbey were greatly reduced in number, and all attempts to resurrect Eldan failed. It was determined that as long as the demon that ate him still existed, Eldan could not be raised from the dead, or resurrected.</p>
