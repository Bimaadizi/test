<p>Xarlandralath , spawn of Xorlughra , was one of the beholders in the service of Manshoon in Suzail during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In beholder shape, Xarlandralath was the size of a coach, with a central eye the size of a table above a fanged maw, and ten smaller eyes on stalks protruding from its spherical body.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>It was magically compelled into service by Manshoon.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As a beholder, it launched rays from its eyes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the catastrophic Council of the Dragon of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the vampire archmage Manshoon sent Xarlandralath, one of his beholders, after the fugitive wizard Elminster Aumar , whom he'd identified as inhabiting the body of Amarune Whitewave , a coinlass and mask dancer .</p>
<p>The beholder came into conflict with a number of Purple Dragons and War Wizards along the way to Castle Obarskyr , where Amarune was. Unknown to both it and Manshoon, Elminster was actually residing in the body of the noble heir Arclath Delcastle . The wizard cast a spell to temporarily wrestle the beholder back into its true shape, and free of compulsions, revealing a man's body during a brief fall. The beholder cried out for release from Manshoon's control at that moment.</p>
<p>The War Wizards and Purple Dragons managed to slay Xarlandralath shortly after that.</p>
