<p>Star rose quartz was a smoky pink quartz which had an asterism .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When cut cabochon, star rose quartz reflected or transmitted light in a star-like pattern. It was used as a centerpiece in modest jewelry, like pectorals and earrings, worn mainly by the matrons of long-established houses. A typical specimen had a base value of 50 gp.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>While carrying or wearing one of these stones, the star rose quartz had a chance to deflect a spell directed at the bearer. Because of this property, this semi-precious stone was an alternate spell component for all abjuration spells and any divine magic of the protection sphere that could use a material component that wasn't specially prepared for a particular spell.</p>
