<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , the Sisters of Fury joined Iceblood, the mysterious priest of Arctus , a demigod child of Auril , on his crusade across Icewind Dale. The hags of Dorotee's covel established lairs across Icewind Dale and began weaving their spells and expanding influence over local monsters. Dorotee Leachlung established her lair in a sea cave in a tiny rocky islet just off the coast of Maer Dualdon just east of the town of Targos . From there, the hag spread chaos through her sahuagin servants. Secretly from her coven, Dorotee was a member of the Kraken Society and served kraken Slarkrethel and High Captain Rethnor of Luskan . For the time being, the Society's goals aligned with Iceblood, but Dorotee was to stop the shaman's activities south of the Spine of the World as the city of Luskan was still recovering after the war with Neverwinter .</p>
<p>Sometime before the Sisters of Fury arrived at Icewind Dale, the night hag named Agaza took residence in the Lonely Wood and did not like other hags encroaching on her territory. When the famed Hero of Neverwinter found Agaza's lair, she convinced them to hunt Dorotee and the Sisters down. Subsequently, the Hero and their comrades stormed Dorotee's lair and ended her evil via decapitation. The Sisters's heads were used by Agaza as sacrifices to perform a ritual that, as the Hero was led to believe, would restore their memories, but, in truth, used to summon Gorgomorz , the Daggerford 's Devil , back to Prime.</p>
