<p>Gunggari Ulmarra was a tattooed soldier from the southern continent of Osse who around 1371 DR found company with the warrior priest, Marrec of Lurue . He joined him in his quest to restore his connection with Lurue in 1373 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was clad in little, save thick-soled leather shoes and a breechcloth , whilst sporting several tattoos on his body. These tattoos spoke of his dedication to Alcheringa.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Gunggari used his dizheri as a deadly weapon. He was also an excellent tracker. He was quite alert, and his stealth was on par with Elowen 's.</p>
<p>He could also produce some mystical effects out of his dizheri, such as a soundwave that pushed people off their feet; it was strong enough to afflict even demon lords such as Eschar .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Gunggari enjoyed traveling. He spoke his mind without great need for deceit. As a man, he knew his worth, taking compliments directly. He was nothing if not practical.</p>
<p>Gunggari hated vampires more than anything else. He showed his respect for the divine through his reserve. He became more talkative and poised after meeting with the restored Araluen .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>His sole possession of value was his dizheri , which served as a walking stick, a musical instrument, and as a club -like weapon. It was covered in colorful designs. The Nentyarch granted a bag of potions upon him when he joined Marrec's quest to restore Araluen.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Gunggari had joined Marrec in his travels over two years before 1373 DR , being one of the rare few good listeners for the half- medusa , who had rescued him from the brink of death more than once. He made fast friends with Elowen whom he treated to many of his stories, though the wisdom of his homeland was far too gruff for her palate.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before he began traveling with Marrec in 1371 DR , Gunggari Ulmarra was a tattooed soldier in Osse . He crossed the Great Sea , arriving at Faerûn , as an explorer. He accompanied Marrec on his trip to Fullpoint ; both travelers crossed the Sea of Fallen Stars , disembarking at Telflamm . They passed through the Golden Way , stopping briefly at Phent and Tammar without incident; while at Phsant , Gunggari somehow ran afoul of the Golden Master , and both travelers barely escaped with their lives.</p>
<p>Throughout Marrec's mission to restore his contact with his goddess, Lurue , he contributed with his skills at scouting, tracking, fighting, and in rare occassions, with actual magic. They ultimately restored Araluen on Mirtul 7 of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR .</p>
