<p>Guffaw Gravelstock , or Guffaw the Stone Eater , was a deep gnome transmuted by Arcturia in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Guffaw was plucked by Arcturia from his Underdark mine and taken to Arcturiadoom , where she altered him to possess a voracious appetite for worked and carved stone. He felt wholly compelled to eat any such stone he encountered and had to limit how much he could devour.</p>
