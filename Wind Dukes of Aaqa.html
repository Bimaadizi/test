<p>The Wind Dukes of Aaqa (sometimes written Aqaa ), or Vaati ( pronounced : /ˈ v ɑː t i / VAH-tee ), were a race of powerful beings dedicated to law which opposed the forces of the Queen of Chaos ; the Obyriths ; and the Elemental Chaos . The nature of the Wind Dukes was unclear: some sages believed them to be powerful denizens of the Elemental Plane of Air , while others believed them to be angels of Bahamut .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Vaati were androgynous humanoids with ebony skin and white eyes. They had muscular builds, yet smooth ebony skin, and on average grew to be 7 feet (2.1 meters) tall. Their hair was velvety and black, but they would usually shave it closely.</p>
<p>Vaati seldom wore clothing, with the exception of belts and harnesses to carry equipment or weaponry.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Vaati were peaceful, usually preferring negotiation over fighting. As creatures of Law they would often appear narrow-minded to other races, and were overly concerned with rules and etiquette.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Vaati were immune to all forms of aging, resistant to spells or abilities based on elemental air , and were capable of flight. Their eyes had infravision , being able to see as far away as 90 feet (27 meters). Uniquely, their eyes could see through all forms of air impediments to vision, such as fog and dust.</p>
<p>All of them possessed an innate spellcasting ability, allowing them to cast powers similar to the spells: control temperature, 10' radius , dust devil , feather fall , and gust of wind .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>If they ever had to resort to combat, the vaati would typically seek to gain height advantage against their opponents and then bombard them from above with spells and ranged weaponry.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Before the war</h3>
<p>Prior to the Dawn War , the Wind Dukes became some of the earliest practitioners of elemental magic . Beginning as elementalists of air and lightning, they eventually mastered other elements and as their mastery of the elements grew, dozens of lawful races and elementals swore fealty to them, such as djinn , inevitables , and salamanders . At its peak their empire comprised most of the elemental planes , uniting them under one rule, as well as several worlds on the Prime Material plane .</p>
<p>Most of their empire was destroyed during the Dawn War.</p>
<h3>The Rod of Seven Parts</h3>
<p>During the Dawn War, seven Wind Dukes were responsible for creating the Rod of Law with the help of the Soulforge of Moradin in Torzak-Belgirn . They went on to use the rod on Oerth , during the battle of the Fields of Pesh , in order to banish Miska the Wolf-Spider .</p>
<h3>Post-Dawn War</h3>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , Mwaxanaré , oldest living descendant of the last queen of Omu , forged a warlock pact with the Wind Dukes to gain magical powers.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>The vaati were an immortal race of beings, with most of them being at least three thousand years old, and had very low birth rates. No more than one or two vaati were born each century.</p>
<p>Each vaati belonged to one of seven castes, which were assigned to them during adolescence.</p>
<p>Finally, some vaati decided to exile themselves and live a life of adventure. Those were called Wendeam , and were not recognized as part of any other caste. They had access to ranger powers, and could track teleporting creatures in the same way a hound of law could. After the defeat of Miska, some of those individuals wandered the planes looking for the lost parts of the Rod of Law, and secretly kept contact with the Trygrideam in order to help in their quest. Some of them had the particularity of being Lawful good , which caused some tensions with other vaati.</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>The vaati were an omnivorous race. They ate very little, subsisting primarily off of air itself, but produced a wide variety of food in their society.</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>The vaati spoke their own unique language. This was very rhythmic and melodic, featuring many complex whistling sounds. A group of vaati talk with each other could sound to other creatures like mere chanting or whispering. Adventuring vaati also knew how to speak Common .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Some aarakocras felt a strong connection to the Vaati and sought to retrieve the shattered pieces of the Rod of Law. Some were said to report directly to the Dukes, and searched for the temples dedicated to evil archomentals .</p>
