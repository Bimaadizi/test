<p>Livewood was a rare variety of magical tree that was found on the world of Eberron .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These trees were quite hardy and had a green coloration to their bark. Most notably, felling a livewood tree would not "kill" it, just stop it from growing any further.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , adventurers in the Icewind Dale area occasionally came across bowls full of sap from a livewood tree. They proceeded to use this sap to create maple rot draught , a special alchemical concoction, at the request of Groundskeeper Seble . [ speculation ]</p>
