<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Zhentilar invasion Shadowdale in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Mawser volunteered to set off a falling-tree trap that would take out many Zhent soldiers and block the incoming road from Voonlar . Under an invisibility spell provided by the mage Elminster , Mawser jumped off a nearly-felled tree, setting others in motion in a cascade that crashed down upon the Zhentilar.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Mawser's luck soon ran out, as he was shot through the neck by a Zhentish arrow.</p>
