<p>Despair of Athkatla was a unique fancifully-adorned enchanted wizard 's staff created and wielded by Lorroakan of Athkatla in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The staff possessed a +2 enchantment that made its physical attacks stronger and guided the wielder's arm towards the targets. Additionally, Despair of Athkatla harnessed its creator's short temper and flooded the wielder's mind with bright shades of burgundy and carmine, focusing their magic into spell resistance and boosting their spell-slinging aim.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Despair of Athkatla was created sometime before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , when it was wielded by the mage Lorroakan, the master of Ramazith's tower and the Sorcerous Sundries shop of Baldur's Gate .</p>
