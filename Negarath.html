<p>Negarath was a Netherese enclave whose ruins were explored in 1375 DR by Fox-at-Twilight and a band of adventurers.</p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>Described as a city of madness, the buildings of Negarath looked like they were built upside-down, because the mythallar reversed gravity and the city floated upside down. Doors and other portals were a variety of mismatched shapes, and the buildings were wavy and irregular. There was a massive temple to Mystryl , and another to Amaunator . Only the central arcanist tower was somewhat normal. It narrowed like a pyramid, then widened again where it curled to a hook.</p>
<p>Magical metal lifts throughout the city could be activated by black rods. There were floating beds of velvet, and furniture made of a variety of metals and glass.</p>
<p>There was a wizard enclave beneath the streets, and below that an extensive sewer system and crypt. The enclave included a summoning circle that was protected by helmed horrors . The crypt contained murals of Netherese battles against phaerimm . There were a number of protective wards and glyphs throughout.</p>
