<p>Lady Spitalsmore was a noblewoman from the City of Splendors, Waterdeep , active circa 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lady Spitalsmore was a matronly lady of Waterdeep who appreciated her tea . One day, sometime before 1372 DR, she returned home from her walk before her usual time. Thinking to have some afternoon tea, she settled at a table just by the door to the basement. Unbeknownst to her, a gnome thief named Purfbin Doogrick was trapped inside, disarmed by the Lady's unscheduled return. Purfbin used junk in his pockets and ingenuity fueled by hunger to capture a lizard in the basement. The rogue unleashed the dreadful beast into Lady Spitalsmore's kitchen, sending her shrieking in terror and out of the kitchen. While she was distracted by mortal danger and the wild beast, Purfbin Doogrick slid out of her basement, ransacked the honest woman's kitchen, and departed Spitalsmore home.</p>
