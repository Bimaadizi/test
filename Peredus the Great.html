<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1372 DR , the song could be heard in the Happy Cow tavern of Daggerford, performed by Jorey Fontalas. The same year, a shady adventurer named Burnas Tellrot theorized that the well from the ballad was located in the Wild Pastures outside fo the city and sought the aid of Hero of Daggerford in retrieval of the "Eldritch sword" that belonged to the folk hero.</p>
<p>By the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , lyrics and music sheet for Peredus the Great was available in a book, simply titled Sword Coast Songbook , a collection of songs compiled by Silke Rosena sometime before her death in the 14 th century DR. Copies of Sword Coast Songbook were found in the city of Baldur's Gate .</p>
