<p>Orangutans were arboreal solitary apes .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Unsociable by nature, adult orangutans were nearly exclusively encountered alone in the wild. Exceptions to this were mothers still raising their young, who were sometimes accompanied by a single male consort. This tendency to stay alone extended to humanoids , by whom orangutans disliked being approached or followed, and any attempts at contact made with speak with animals were most likely met with irritated evasion. Some male orangutans would even be outright hostile to those who invaded their privacy, even though the species was typically not aggressive.</p>
<p>Despite their solitary nature, some jungle-dwelling rangers had orangutan followers that could handily be trained.</p>
<p>Orangutans knew their surroundings well, and were especially familiar with their local fruit trees, sometimes to such an extent that some males weighed too much to swing through the trees and had to traverse the forest floor instead.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Orangutans were found in the jungles of Kara-Tur .</p>
