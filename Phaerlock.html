<p>Phaerlocks were a twisted species that lived in constant pain.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Phaerlocks were lizard-like humanoids that stood about 6​ to ​7 feet (1.8​ to ​2.1 meters) tall and generally weighed about 200​ to ​250 pounds (91​ to ​110 kilograms). They had crimson-red, plate-like hide that closer resembled a beholder's hide than scales, and had four watery, yellow eyes evenly spaced out around the head. The mouth was filled with sharp teeth, and they had clawed hands and a distinctly reptilian tail.</p>
<h2>Personalities</h2>
<p>Phaerlocks cared little for others and sought only to share their pain.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Phaerlocks could see all around themselves thanks to their four eyes, and they were exceptionally alert and hard to surprise or sneak past. Additionally, by focusing their gaze on a creature within 30 feet (9.1 meters) of them, they could paralyze it with horrific pain; however, this ability did not effect constructs, oozes, elementals, undead, or plant creatures.</p>
<p>As an odd holdover from some lost aquatic heritage, phaerlocks could hold their breath for approximately 6 minutes before needing to breathe again.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Phaerlocks preferred to paralyze enemies at a distance before closing in to attack with their claws and teeth.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Phaerlocks were solitary, nomadic creatures native to the Underdark , where they normally lived short and hardscrabble lives. They were descended from lizardfolk that were bred and warped by powerful magic at the hands of the phaerimm . This was the cause of the constant, unending agony they felt, and even every breath was painful. A rare few managed to learn mental tricks to keep the pain at bay.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , a large number of phaerlocks roamed the mines of Tethyamar as agents of Rezlus and his Banite faction of the Zhentarim .</p>
