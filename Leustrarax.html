<p>Leustrarax was the barbarian shaman leader of the Bear-Tooth tribe sometime before 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Leustrarax's most notable possession was a set of enchanted heavy armor - Deep Dark Red . The armor was taken as a trophy from an ambitious knight who attempted to expand his fiefdom into the Bear-Tooth tribe's territory. Soon after, the Bear-Tooth tribe was attacked by the Bloody Tusk‎‎ orcs . Along with the warriors of his tribe, Leustrarax turned back the tide of battle after a series of relentless assaults. The barbarians pushed orcish forces back into the craves they poured out of. Leustrarax armed himself with Deep Dark Red , which allowed him to see in the pitch darkness of the orc caves, and ventured in. Subsequently, Leustrarax killed the chieftain of Bloody Tusk‎‎s with a single poisoned arrow .</p>
