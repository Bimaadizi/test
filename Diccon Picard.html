<h2>History</h2>
<p>On Kythorn 27 in the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , Diccon Picard and the merchant Barthelm Meadowbrock rode out of town one evening to see what the new Swamp Rat (Diccon misremembered it as Swamp Fox) tavern was like. They weren't impressed. On the way back, they sighted the ghost of the bandit chieftain Fastred and raced back to town in fear. Since Barthelm didn't want to lose business with Shortshanks of the rival Bold Bard tavern, Diccon let on that he had been alone.</p>
<p>Later that year, on Eleint 18 , Jasper went to Diccon's jewellery store to ask him about the ghost sighting, after it was discovered to be Dovo in disguise.</p>
