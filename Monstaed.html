<p>Lady Monstaed was a wealthy woman of Yhaunn in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>By 1373 DR, Lady Monstaed was an elderly woman.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lady Monstaed was a widow, and inherited a number of properties from her husband. Around Flamerule of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , she was secretly replaced by the Thultantharan priestess of Shar Variance Amatick using her magic ring , who proceeded to use Monstaed's identity and assets to further her own plans in Yhaunn. She transferred desirable property leases from Ladysluck Tower to Moonshadow Hall , and held social get-togethers with Mifano , the Selûnite priest responsible for wooing rich benefactors. Through Mifano, she obtained insider gossip at the temple of Selûne, learning of Feena Archwood 's investigation into the Sharrans of Yhaunn, and Keph Thingoleir 's assault on Lyraene , allowing her to modify Lyraene's memories of the events and keep Keph from further trouble.</p>
<p>After Variance was revealed and driven from Yhaunn on the new moon of Eleasis , it remained to be seen what had become of the real Lady Monstaed.</p>
