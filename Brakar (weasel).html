<p>Brakar was a weasel and the familiar of Chaid al Farid al Fuqani , an apprentice of Blackstaff Tower .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Brakar had fur that matched the color of his master's eyes almost perfectly.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Chaid first bonded with Brakar on Uktar 28 in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , after a night and morning of performing the required magical ritual. Chaid wanted to name the creature "Brakar", after the brakar , a two- gold piece in circulation in Darromar , the capital of Tethyr . On the advice of Tsarra Chaadren , Chaid first asked the weasel if he already had a name, and, on learning that he did not, asked if he minded being called "Brakar", to which the little magic animal agreed. Brakar was very happy to be given a name and took it as a gift.</p>
<p>Later in the day, Brakar skittered across Chaid's shoulders and heads in excitement at seeing inside the gates of Waterdeep for the first time.</p>
<p>Tsarra had to instruct her own familiar, the tressym Nameless that the weasel was not food.</p>
