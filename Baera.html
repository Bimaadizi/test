<p>Baera was a dwarven surveyor that lived on the Sword Coast North during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Baera worked with Thrimbul , a historian that joined the Hillborn expedition into Mount Hotenow .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Mount Hotenow erupted in the Year of Knowledge Unearthed, 1451 DR , a network of dwarven ruins became uncovered within the volcano. While the city of Neverwinter was partially destroyed in the cataclysm, the years that followed saw Neverwintan people making great effort to rebuild their home. After the city was well underway towards full reconstruction, the dwarves of Clan Hillborn embarked upon an expedition into Mount Hotenow to explore their ancestral ruins and perhaps find a link to the legendary lost dwarfhold of Gauntlgrym .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the expedition discovered that the fire giant Gommoth and the cult of Maegera proved a threat to Neverwinter as they sought to reawaken the slumbering primordial once again. The dwarves took action to help slow the cult's progress and prevent their success. Baera worked with the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge to install a trio of scrying spheres in the caldera of Mount Hotenow to observe cult activities and gleam more information about the mad giant's activities.</p>
<p>Together, they learned that Gommoth planned to use a trio of precisely-aligned focusing shrines in order to complete his ritual to awaken Maegera. The hero of the city sabotaged the shrines' alignment, buying themselves enough time to slay several of Gommoth's generals, and infiltrate the Temple of the Primordial .</p>
