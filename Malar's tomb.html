<p>Malar's tomb , alternatively called the Beastlord's tomb and sometimes referred to as Malar's temple , was a holy site dedicated to the god Malar located on the island of Moray in the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The tomb lay in a cave beneath Scourtop , the northernmost peak of the Orcskull Mountains in the south of Moray. It was only accessible via a ruined city in a vale beneath the mountain's summit.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>A huge square opening in the granite mountainside served as the entryway. This was effectively a massive, cube-shaped porch lined with marble . In the back of this porch was a much older cave dug into the mountainside, which was blackened with soot and lined with torches set in iron fittings.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>At the end of this tunnel, deep inside the heart of Scourtop, was a rough-hewn chamber of reddish rock with a blood-stained floor of agate tiles. This chamber was ringed by thirteen basalt columns fitted with iron chains and manacles for stringing up sacrifices, and at the center of the room was a human -height table of light stone covered in glyphs and with lanterns on two ends. Air vents leading to the surface provided enough oxygen for the fires.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Rituals in the tomb were held each new moon , and involved thirteen adherents of Malar and copious blood sacrifices.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Believed to have originally been a primitive shrine dedicated to one or more Primordials , it was consecrated as a temple to Malar following its discovery by members of the Black Blood tribe .</p>
<p>During the period when Malar was "dead" following the Spellplague , his steaming corpse lay in this tomb upon the table as a centerpiece for sacrifices and rituals attempting to revive him, which were led by his angelic servant , Argon Bael . A prophecy held that the revival of Malar required both a cleric of a consenting greater deity and a special sacrifice to serve as his vessel. In the late 1470s DR, both of these criteria were met when Argon Bael was made aware by High Lady Ordalf of Sarifal that two individuals were headed to the island: a priestess of Chauntea named Marikke and an empathic cat-shifter named Kip . Bael and his allies in the Black Blood tribe captured these two, brought them to the tomb, and with torture and coercion, successfully managed to revive Malar within the body of Kip (although the ritual also cost Bael his life).</p>
<p>Following Malar's resurrection, his former tomb then served as his temple as he gained strength before calling for a High Hunt and inciting the Battle of Caer Moray . As of 1479Â DR , sacrifices continued to be offered in the shrine each dark of the moon.</p>
<p>In 1479 DR, a young Northlander noble named Daffyd Mac Lyrr discovered a map that he believed pointed to the Black Blood's temple of Malar, and he concocted a plan to attack it and decapitate the tribe. However, the map he discovered pointed to a defunct temple that had instead become the lair of the purple dragon known as Whitescar .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Black Blood lycanthropes loyal to Malar served him within the tomb, although only predatory lycanthropes (such as werewolves ) were allowed within its depths.</p>
