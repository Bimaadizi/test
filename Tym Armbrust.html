<p>Tym Armbrust a down-on-his-luck tailor, husband of Talli Armbrust and father of Ayo Armbrust from Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tym was a human man with a light skin tone, light brown hair and beard, and blue eyes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , when Tym faced financial difficulties, he was already a successful tailor who made simple clothes for laborers and fanciful garb for its patriars . His journal was filled with intricately designed dresses and patterns. By the time the Absolute crisis struck the city, Tym's business began to dwindle, with "paid in full" lines in his ledger being almost fully replaced with "IOUs." Lack of immediate income quickly doomed the tailor and led him into a pit of debt. Desperate, Tym loaned money from the notorious Guild of Baldur's Gate but eventually could not pay the debt off. He received a letter from Guildmaster Nine-Finger Keene with an implicit threat to his family and a notification that her collectors would soon come for the late fee. Tym told his son not to talk to "tax collectors" and lamented the lack of locks on their entrance door.</p>
