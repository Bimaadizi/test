<p>Greed motes were creatures that were connected to diamonds . They were made entirely out of greed and could incite greed in others.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Greed motes appeared as glowing forms of green light, emanating from within a diamond. Their bodies had tentacles with barbs at the ends.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Greed motes first appeared as green beams of light that could curse nearby creatures. Those cursed became stunned by greed when presented with items of immense wealth.</p>
<p>The stingers of a greed mote were poisonous and in some cases paralytic.</p>
<p>Greed motes could not be killed until the diamond that they were connected to was destroyed. When the diamond was broken, the greed motes were also destroyed, but they had one last chance to cause hallucinations of violent paranoia in any creatures affected by their curse of greed.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 1480s DR , members of the Cult of the Dragon hid a diamond inhabited by greed motes in a cache of treasure in a part of the northern Greypeak Mountains that had become green. Veradda Stoor , a famous treasure hunter, collected notes on the location of this cache. When she was killed by giants , adventurers used her notes to find the cult's treasure. By the time that they arrived, the greed motes had already manipulated two frost giants into killing each other.</p>
