<p>Pog was a rock gnome guard of Gnomengarde in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Alongside Ulla , Pog was one of Gnomengarde's sentries. It was his job to hail any outsiders in Common , and to attack anyone he deemed to be a threat.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>In addition to his innate gnomish abilities, Pog (like everyone else in Gnomengarde) had some training as a wizard . In combat, he preferred to attack with spells like ray of frost and magic missile .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Gnomengarde came under attack by a mimic in the late 15 th century DR, the only information given to the gnomes by their king, Korboz , was to attack any shapechangers on sight. Unfortunately, this left Pog and his partner Ulla in a predicament because anyone could be a shapechanger. They were thus highly suspicious of any outsiders, and were unlikely to let anyone pass without a fight unless they could persuade the sentries otherwise or unless they had an audience with King Korboz or King Gnerkli .</p>
