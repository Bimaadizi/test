<p>Arxhadk was the morkoth ambassador of Olleth in Sshamath in the year 1370 DR .</p>
<p>Arxhadk hailed from the Arcanum of Olleth , the morkoth magocracy in the Sea of Fallen Stars . He survived out of the water thanks to a golem -like construct that resembled and had the powers of a massive water elemental , which he dwelt inside. Arxhadk had a slithering tracker as a familiar and sometimes he used it as silent and unseen assassin, unknown to the drow of Sshamath.</p>
