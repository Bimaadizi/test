<p>The Mal'eb'dala , or The Book of the Shadows when translated from the ancient Talfirian tongue, was an ancient book of Talfir . The author was unknown, but there may have been more than one author that contributed to the book.</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>Similar to an encyclopedia, it detailed many ancient matters long forgotten by the 14 th century DR , such as magic , monsters, and magical items . A passage of the book described the rise of the Shadowking , and his defeat at the hands of the bard Talek Talembar . It was perhaps the only known source of information on the thirteen shadevar as of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The original was destroyed in battle when two mages fought each other to the death. Nearly all copies were lost or ruined by the mid-1300s. One copy was in the library of Elversult , where it had laid for two centuries until it was stolen in 1363 DR by Tembris for Ravendas . Another copy was made by a loremaster of Oghma , Loremaster Erill, in a monastery in the Sunset Mountains . That copy was given to the wizard Morhion Gen'dahar in 1363 DR and since then resided in his tower in Iriaebor .</p>
