<p>Moria Chantel was an evil mage in the Utter East during the time of the Bloodforge Wars ( 648 – 657 DR ).</p>
<p>Moria Chantel had a practice of kidnapping travellers near Phantom Pass , for use in a ceremony that bestowed immortality on the mage. After hearing a haunting tale of this, the leader of the Legendary Campaign decided to deal with Moria. They timed their arrival in Phantom Pass to suit the needs of the ceremony and disguised themselves as suitable victims, only to confront the mage in bloodforge battle.</p>
