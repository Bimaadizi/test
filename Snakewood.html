<p>The Snakewood was a relatively small forest located in eastern Amn .</p>
<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>It was given the name "Snakewood" because of the great number of black and green snakes that lived there.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The forest was located west of the Troll Mountains , south of the Green Fields , north of the Amstel and Splendarrllur rivers and east of the Cloud Peaks .</p>
<h2>Flora & Fauna</h2>
<p>Other than snakes, the forest was known to be the home of small pockets of giant spiders</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Snakewood was once part of the great forest of Shantel Othreier . The forest was split off from Shantel Othreier by dragon fires as early as −11,700 DR .</p>
<p>By −1100 DR , elves had slain the last great dragon from the forest, then known as the Wyrmwood , and they founded a kingdom there, which they called Arundath , the Quiet Wood.</p>
<p>The elves were nearly eradicated by humans during the last one hundred years of the Shoon Imperium , (the late 350s DR ). This was because the elves tried to protect a small herd of seven unicorns in the woods from the evil emperor Shoon VII , who wanted their horns for his magic, in particular for the powerful artifact known as the Tome of the Unicorn . In retaliation, Shoon VII hunted them down. About a third of the elves were driven from the forest, another third made into slaves, and the final third subjected to torturous magical experiments.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The forest contained a small number of beholders and lycanthropes . Wild elves lived among the trees of the woods, but rarely more than for a few summers at a time.</p>
<p>The ambitious green dragon Ringreemeralxoth laired in the northern hills southwest of Brigand's Gorge and west of the Gulf of Storms . Druids of Eldath live in the central woods, in Duskwood Dell.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Those living near the forest suspected that the Eldathyn druids might be the cause of the high population of snakes living there, but this had not been confirmed.</p>
