<p>The Way of Screaming Swords was a magical portal linking the Realm of the Mount to the city of Ravens Bluff .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>On the Realm of the Mount side, the portal could be found in Hool , inside the ruins of Xavander Relurvor 's mansion. On the Ravens Bluff side, it was located in a back alley of the Harbor District .</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The Way was a one-user-at-a-time portal that could be activated by stepping on a particular stone. On the Ravens Bluff side, one had to pronounce the phrase "All praise Xavander" in order to activate it.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The portal was protected by the eponymous Screaming Swords: four flying, sword-shaped "needles" of magical force. They would attack anyone casting magic at the portal, and would also attack any "foe" designated by the Dread King Helemvo Relurvor if they approached too close. Those swords generated a high-pitched wailing sound, which gave them their name.</p>
<p>In addition, the portal on the Realm of the Mount side was protected by several golems and other constructs installed by Helemvo, as well as floating disembodied eyes keeping watch over the ruined mansion and serving as a proxy for his spells.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The portal was built by the wizard Xavander Relurvor after the foundation of his realm circa the Year of the Fallen Throne, 1319 DR .</p>
