<p>The Green Door , popularized as simply the Door , was an inn and festhall in Essembra , Battledale , in the midâ€“14 th century DR , which also concealed a shrine to the forest goddess Mielikki .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Door was located on the east side of Rauthauvyr's Road just north of Battle Court and the Silver Taproom .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Green Door had a green-painted front entry door that most believed gave the inn its name.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Reflecting its name, the Green Door had wall tapestries displaying splendid forest scenes throughout the building. It was clean and simply furnished.</p>
<p>There was no common dining hall or taproom, but there were harping chambers on each floor at the hearth end for patrons to meet and talk in.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Door was once the most riotous and notorious festhall in the Dales , until Lashan Aumersair of Scardale occupied Essembra and ordered troops to murder its ladies, after which it became officially just an inn.</p>
<p>In the 1360s DR, the Door was a place of pilgrimage for followers of Mielikki because it was the site of a pool of special waters, preserved in a wooded, backyard bower. The pool was the real "Green Door", whose tranquil waters held visions from Mielikki to her faithful.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Followers of Mielikki believed this is where their deity appeared in person to Florin Falconhand .</p>
