<p>The Red Plumes was a mercenary army of warriors that operated directly under the will of First Lord Maalthiir . They enforced his will within the walls of Hillsfar , even going so far as to harass its inhabitants, while regularly extorting them, in order to maintain a fear of his authority. They understood their limits however, never going as far as to warrant complaints that could be overheard by the First Lord.</p>
<p>Along with guarding the city, patrols of the Red Plumes could often be found keeping an eye open for monsters, members of the Zhentarim , or other threats.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Red Plumes were driven out of Hillsfar in 1376 DR by forces from Zhentil Keep . However, after three years of chaos, Maalthiir returned with a new force of Red Plumes and took back the rulership of the city. As of 1460 DR , Red Plumes maintained their presence in Hillsfar.</p>
