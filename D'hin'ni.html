<p>A d'hin'ni was a type of planetouched that was the combination of a genie ancestor and halfling (or hin as they were also called) blood.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Commonly descended from slave lightfoot hin and their djinn masters, they mixed the halfling's disinterest in the battles of morals and ethics, but the unpredictability of djinn caused the majority of them to take the chaotic neutral alignment.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The outsider nature of planetouched caused a lot of variations of appearance, but the males were almost always bald while the women had long black hair. They were taller than their hin relatives, but not as tall as dwarves . They favored clothing of silk and cotton.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>D'hin could trace their bloodlines back to Calim Empire , which was ruled by djinn. When the genies were overthrown by what was to be the people of Coramshan , the d'hin fled northward to avoid being persecuted by those who hated their genie blood. They moved to the Calishar Emirates with the great halfling migration. By the 14th century DR , d'hin were common on the Sword Coast in halfling communities in Calimshan , the Purple Hills of Tethyr , the eastern shores of Lake Esmel , the Sunset Vale , and near Secomber .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>They filled many roles in their communities, but had a strong bent to the arcane arts and many became sorcerers . They tended to worship the same gods as their hin kin, but they especially loved Brandobaris and also surprisingly venerated the human god Shaundakul . They loved fine scimitars , curved daggers , clothing, and jewelry (especially earrings).</p>
