<p>The Foulwater tribe was a group of goblins that laired within the Twilight Marsh of the Moonsea North for a time during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The tribe's leadership was taken over by a particularly large bugbear named Gorrunk . It was estimated the Foulwater tribe included dozens, if not several hundred goblinoid members.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>They spent much of their time raiding and only a few scant members remained within their den in the marsh.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Foulwater goblins operated out of a cave system in the Twilight Marsh, the entrance of which was protected by a tripwire trap.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>They kept several pet wolves within their underground home.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The tribe moved into a cave some time in the 1480s DR , after the black dragon that previously claimed it as its lair was slain by adventurers . Not long later, the reborn Cult of the Dragon came to investigate and wound up slaying many of the Foulwater goblins.</p>
<p>In the end, the goblins and cultists came to an agreement. The goblins would allowed to remain within the dragon's old cave, so long as they exclusively sold to the cult any items of interest found within.</p>
<p>After the Zhentarim agent Chaab was found investigating too close to the cave, the cult ordered the Foulwater goblins to begin raiding the surrounding lands. They ended up attacking the Moss family peat farm and capturing nearly everyone that remained there. Only Millivent Moss and her infant child managed to escape the goblins' clutches.</p>
