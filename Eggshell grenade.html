<p>Eggshell grenades were a variety of diversionary or incapacitating thrown weapons unique to the lands of Kara-Tur that were commonly utilized by ninjas . Despite their name, these objects did not exhibit the explosive force typical of grenades , instead "bursting" with their contents.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These devices were so named for traditionally being made of carefully blown-out eggshells , though it was not uncommon for one to find grenades made from the hollowed out shells of nuts, paper packets, or other materials that were small and easy to break. The interior of these objects would be filled with different types of powder in order to create a distraction or blind an opponent. Because of the materials they were made from, eggshell grenades were quite fragile.</p>
