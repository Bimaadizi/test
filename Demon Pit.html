<p>The Demon Pit was a seemingly bottomless chasm in the city of Evernight in the Shadowfell . It existed in the same location as the Chasm in Evernight's twin, Neverwinter .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Demon Pit was slightly smaller than the Chasm on the Material Plane . It exuded powerful necromantic energies, even by the standards of the Shadowfell. The air was colder, lights were dimmer, and undead were drawn to the land around the Pit. This power left the living feeling fatigued while undead were empowered.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the Chasm opened in Neverwinter during the Ruining , this reflection of it appeared in Evernight. The city's ghouls and vampires could not explain the seemingly bottomless crack that had appeared in their city, and dubbed it the "Demon Pit" because they believed it led to the Abyss , specifically the White Kingdom of Doresain . As of 1479Â DR , no one had managed to descend into the Pit and return to confirm or deny this belief. Nevertheless, this did not stop Evernight's faithful of Doresain and Orcus from throwing living creatures into the Demon Pit as sacrifices.</p>
