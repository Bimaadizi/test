<h2>Background</h2>

<p>A few factors rose to become kingpins, hiring other factors to work for them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 13 th century DR , factors didn't exist as an actual profession. The few individuals who identified as such usually worked for nobles, royal households, or courts.</p>
<p>In 1270 DR , factors became professionals hired by merchants or other parties, increasing in importance and influence in the following decades. Thanks to the rise of factors as important trade dealers, adventuring also became an actual profession, as factors usually hired adventurers to serve as bodyguards and agents.</p>
