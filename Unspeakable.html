<p>The Unspeakable , or He Whose Name Must Not Be Spoken , was a yak-man who possessed the body of Mu'izzi al-Kamar , in 1367 DR .</p>
<p>Other yikarians referred to him as "Revered Master," which is their term for a High Priest.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The emperor of the yikarians tasked the Unspeakable with gaining ultimate control of the Court of Enlightenment .</p>
<p>The Unspeakable first encountered Mu'izzi al-Kamar during the 1340s DR when some of his earthservants grabbed him after a sandstorm struck his caravan. After entering his mind and realizing that Mu'izzi was the head of one of the richest merchant families in Huzuz , the Unspeakable instantly recognized the opportunity to wreak havoc upon the Grand Caliph by possessing Mu'izzi's body. Within a year of his "return" to Huzuz in Mu'izzi's body, the Unspeakable had utterly charmed every member of the House of Al-Kamari to protect his disguise.</p>
<p>The Unspeakable's first task to harm the Grand Caliph was to ensure he never fathered an heir. He accomplished this feat by forcing Suha , his noble dao slave, to bury magical amulets within the masonry of each room of the royal harim . The amulets were protected against magical detection. They prevented male conception by any female within every room of the harim.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The Unspeakable wore a ring of protection +2 , wielded a staff of the sands , and always carried potions of human control .</p>
