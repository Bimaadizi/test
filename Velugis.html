<p>Velugis was one of the Blades of the Old Man as of 1374Â DR . Originally, he was from Thay , and he mostly kept to himself, staying in his bed when he was not on assignment. Word on the fortress was that he drank only water, and never asked for a woman to be sent to his room. However, he was known to have a grasp of poisons and alchemy second only to that of the Old Man of the Mountain himself. He spotted one of the Blades of the Old Man that Berun fought through in the night of Tarsakh 25 to make his way to Chereth and Lewan inside Sentinelspire , from his post just inside the main gate.</p>
