<p>Lord Gervas Imesfor was a respected elven high mage that lived in the city of Evereska as of the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He had one known son Louenghris , who served as a member of the Tomb Guard under patrol leader Galaeron Nihmedu . Louenghris died while on patrol within the ancestral crypts of House Vyshaan , after Galaeron and the shadow mage Melegaunt Tanthul inadvertently released the phaerimm from behind the Sharn Wall . Ironically, it was Lord Imesfor that originally made the appeal for Galaeron to gain admittance into the Tomb Guard.</p>
<p>Lord Imesfor was held in high esteem by his fellow gold elves within the city.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the Sharn Wall was breached beneath the Greycloak Hills in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Lord Imesfor was among the high mages that attempted to repair the damage done and prevent the released phaerimm from overwhelming the Evereska Vale . While he was distraught over Louenghris' death, Imesfor managed to survive alongside his fellow Kiinyon Colbathin , but was forced to endure torture and ridicule by the horrific creatures. In time he was rescued by Galaeron, Melegaunt, and the mage's Vaasan followers. As the group fled the phaerimm through the Shadow Fringe , Melegaunt set Imesfor up as a decoy so the sorcerer and his followers could get away safely. Fortunatley, Lord Imesfor was able to teleport himself to Blackstaff Tower in Waterdeep , the home of his comrade Khelben Arunsun , just as a mind flayer descended upon him.</p>
<p>Imesfor was tended to by his friend Khelben and Angharad Odaeyns , an elven healer dispatched from Evermeet . He relayed to them both the story of what had taken place and convinced Khelben and Lady Laeral Silverhand to aid in Evereska's defense.</p>
<p>On Tarsakh 24 of the following Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Lord Imesfor served as Evereska's representative on the council that hosted Prince Aglarel Tanthul of Thultanthar , to discuss the tenuous alliance formed between the Shadovar and the realms of the Heartlands . The following month in Mirtul , he oversaw the defense of the Vine Vale alongside Evereska's ally Laeral Silverhand and Prince Lamorak Tanthul , Aglarel's brother.</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Lord Imesfor traveled to Evermeet to ask their help to stop the Fey'ri invasion of Evereska.</p>
