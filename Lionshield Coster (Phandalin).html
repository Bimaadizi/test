<p>The Lionshield Coster in Phandalin was a trading post that served the town in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>It was a modest building. Above the front door was a weathered wooden sign in the shape of a shield on which was painted a blue lion .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Armor and weapons were stored in a back room to keep them out of the hands of any who might wish harm upon the town of Phandalin.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The store served as an outpost and delivery point for caravans run by the Lionshield Coster , and specialized mostly in providing the people of Phandalin with finished goods, horses , armor, weapons, and other adventuring equipment. It was perhaps the only place in town where adventurers could sell valuable treasures for reasonable prices, although the rates were much lower than in Neverwinter .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR , deliveries to the Phandalin Lionshield Coster were frequently attacked by bandits, including the Cragmaw tribe . At least one caravan from Yartar was completely lost, with all of its goods being taken to the Cragmaw Hideout .</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Duplicitous Courtier, 1496 DR , the trading post had greatly expanded its inventory and was in direct competition with the Phandalin Miner's Exchange .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The master of the trading post was Linene Graywind , who was assisted by her daughter, Minghee Graywind . They did not live on-site, but in a home just west of the trading post.</p>
