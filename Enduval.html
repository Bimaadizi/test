<p>Enduval was a cursed berserking sword .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The sword shone brightly.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Enduval had a curse: when first used in combat, it forced its user to attack the person nearest to them, be it friend or foe. They had to keep attacking until either they or their opponent were slain; for this attack alone, it had a powerful enchantment. Only an exorcise or wish spell could rid one of this sword.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1356Â DR , Enduval was found in a T-shaped intersection within Kordan's Master Maze in the Pyramid of Amun-Re . There were bodies strewn around it, from which the smell of death rose; one of them was spitted with the brightly shining sword.</p>
