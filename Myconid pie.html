<p>Myconid pie was an aptly-named variety of Duergar pie made, presumably, using the flesh of myconids .</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , expensive 2 pounds (0.91 kilograms) servings of myconid pie were sold by Gorstaf , a rude duergar baker from the city of Gracklstugh in the Underdark in northwest Faerûn . Gorstaf claimed that myconid pies were for those willing to "take their health in their own hands."</p>
