<p>Watcher's blade was inscribed with a number of runes that read: "Stay True and so Will Your Steel" .</p>

<p>When the sword wielded by a member of the Kenric family, it felt as light as a mere dagger and had the sharpness to cleave oak shields and steel armor . It granted its wielder the ability to deflect and even destroy projectiles of shadow magic .</p>
<p>The Helm's Eye jewel shone with a bright blue cone radiance whenever in the presence of the Shadovar , dispelling the darkness.</p>
<p>Distant allies of the wielder might be compelled by the illumination of Helm's Eye to heroically aid guardianship with or follow orders of the wielder.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
