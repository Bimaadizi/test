<p>The Shoal of Thirst was a great salt flat located in the expansive desert of Anauroch in north Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Shoal of Thirst was located in the region of Anauroch known as the Sword , directly between the Wall of Fallen Djinn mountain range, and the Scimitar Spires .</p>
<p>The Sister of Rains oasis was located beyond the Shoal's western border.</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>Rather than being covered in sand like the rest of the desert, the great basin was entirely flat and covered in salt. This caused heat from the sun to reflect upward, causing the little rain it received to vaporize and no plant life to grow.</p>
<p>It was a precarious location to travel across, even for the local Bedine people and their camels , who were quite accustomed to life in the desert.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Long before the Era of Upheaval , during the age of ancient Netheril , the area in which the Shoal was situated was once a body of water known as the Hidden Lake .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , the witch Ruha , her brother-in-law Kadumi , and the Harper agent named Lander famously crossed the Shoal of Thirst twice. They crossed from the Well of the Chasm in the east to the Sister of Rains in the west, then crossed the salt flats again to Elah'zad in the north.</p>
<p>When the Netherese enclave of Thultanthar returned to north Faerûn in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the basin was transformed once again. Three Princes of Shade performed a ritual that created a huge storm above the Shoal , and a lake of chilled water formed within the Shoal; the Shadow Sea remained in the place of the great salt flats.</p>
