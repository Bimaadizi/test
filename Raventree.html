<p>The Raventree ( pronounced : /ˈ r eɪ v ɛ n t r i / RAY-ven-tree ) family were members of the nobility in Waterdeep in the late 14 th century DR . They were shipbuilders and also specialized in procuring and importing rare delicacies for those that could afford the price.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Lord Nandos Raventree was the patriarch of the family from at least the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , to at least the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . His consort was Lady Perryn . Their eldest son and heir was Surakh and they had a daughter, Galinda . As of 1372 DR, there were twenty-four living members in the clan. Typically, the family had liquid resources totally some 25,000 gold pieces if needed. The Raventrees primarily venerated Selûne .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Raventrees were primarily shipbuilders in both Waterdeep and, since the late 1360s DR, New Waterdeep in Maztica . They were also particularly interested in importing unusual foods and delicacies that could be sold in Waterdeep for a tidy profit.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The headquarters of the family was the Raventree Villa –a walled compound of 2- and 3-story buildings surrounding a green space located on the northwest corner of Chasso's Trot and Sul Street in the Sea Ward . Directly across Chasso's Trot to the south was Tessalar's Tower , home of the rich and powerful wizard Tessalar Hulicorm . By the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , the Raventrees had also established a base in New Waterdeep.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>By the late 1360s DR, the Raventrees had working relationships with three other noble families, the Adarbrents , the Helmfasts , and the Jardeths , and the Church of Helm , with whom they cosponsored the expedition to Maztica that resulted in the founding of the New Waterdeep settlement there. However, Lord Royus Adarbrent was disapproving of the Raventrees and was particularly against his son Alroy 's infatuation with Galinda Raventree.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Raventree family were of Tethyrian descent and the family was ennobled in Waterdeep in the Year of the Cockatrice, 1248 DR , but back in the Year of the Watching Raven, 913 DR , when Waterdeep was known as Nimoar's Hold, they were robber barons that proclaimed themselves nobility.</p>
