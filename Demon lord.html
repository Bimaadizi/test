<p>Demon lords , also known as Abyssal lords , were archfiends who gained great power and established a position of preeminence among demonkind . Over millennia, these demons had amassed tremendous power and authority over their domain.</p>
<h2>Hierarchy</h2>
<p>Each demon lord had a unique appearance and set of abilities and ruled over at least one layer of the Abyss . Those that controlled several layers and rose higher in power gave themselves the title of demon prince . Both "demon lord" and "demon prince" were self-proclaimed titles by those who had gained enough power and influence. The demonic fiends were in an eternal struggle, edging and fighting for dominion over one another. Unlike the archdevils , the chaotic evil demon lords did not have a rigid hierarchy, though they appeared in greater numbers throughout the Blood War .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Demon lords waged eternal war with each other, often seeking ways to expand their holdings into other layers and at the same time defend their personal domains from rival lords and scheming underlings. Obox-ob was the first demon lord to hold the title of "Prince of Demons", a coveted status symbol, followed by Miska the Wolf-Spider , and then Demogorgon . Orcus and Graz'zt contested this title, while Obox-ob desired to regain it.</p>
<p>Most demon lords had secretive mortal cults who sought to elevate their lords to godhood through prayer and sacrifice.</p>
