<p>The Breath of Petron was a piece of the lungs of a primordial named Petron . This artifact was made by a slave dragonborn named Haizverad , who stole a small part of the remains of Petron collected by the dragon Versveshardinazar . The Breath of Petron was inherited by the descendants of Haizverad, and used in the Battle of the Crippled Mountain against the red dragon Rhodrolytharnestrix .</p>
<p>After the Spellplague , the dragonborn survivors of Tymanchebar used the Breath of Petron to construct Djerad Thymar , by lifting and fusing the remains of the capital djerad of Tymanchebar, the ruins of the God-Tomb of Nanna-Sin , and rocks from the Smoking Mountains . Since then, the artifact was guarded by members of Clan Shestandeliath .</p>
<p>The Breath of Petron was used again, in Hammer 9 of 1487 DR , by Shestandeliath Geshthax in order to create an earth barrier to protect Djerad Thymar against the advancing Untherite led by Gilgeam .</p>
