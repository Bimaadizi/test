<p>The Room of a Hundred and Three Pillars was located within the Potala in Saikhoi , Ra-Khati .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The main chamber of the Room of a Hundred and Three Pillars was a giant work of art.</p>
<p>Large rafters hanging 30 ft (9.1 m) overheard were painted with beautiful floral patterns themed with different colors. As the name of the room implied, over 100 large stone pillars connected the floor and ceiling of the chamber. Each of these pillars was wrapped with finely woven tapestries depicting a wide variety of scenery from Ra-Khati's history. Proverbs were inscribed on the pillars beneath the tapestries, explaining what the Dalai Lama learned from the historical event.</p>
<p>A large golden statue dominated the far end of the chamber. The statue depicted an ancient monk meditating cross-legged with his eyes facing the sky. Large rubies were used for the statue's eyes and a fist-sized emerald filled his navel. Made from solid gold , the statue weighed over 30 tons. A karma curse was placed upon the statue to protect against theft. The statue was actually a representation of Mahavidi , the Padhrasattva of erudition.</p>
