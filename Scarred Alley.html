<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Scarred Alley was located in Baldur's Gate's Outer City just a few blocks from Little Calimshan .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As the city of Baldur's Gate had been largely untouched by the Spellplague , the citizens were unaccustomed to those with spellscars and regarded them with fear. Thus, they were unofficially quarantined in Scarred Alley. At some point, the Order of Blue Fire established a mission there to care for the spellscarred.</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, Grand Duke Valarken developed an interest in the spellscarred, believing that their bodies were ideal vessels for lycanthropy . He worked to subvert both the guards in Scarred Alley as well as the Order of Blue Fire, driving out those who would not cooperate and converting the remainder to his cause. As of 1479Â DR , he had used the promise of a better life to buy the loyalty of many of the spellscarred in Scarred Alley, and had replaced all the guards with loyalists and lycanthropes .</p>
