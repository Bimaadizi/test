<p>Sting rays , also known as stingrays , were a relatively common mundane species of aquatic animal in the ray family. They were cousins of the much larger manta ray .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The bodies of these creatures generally grew to be 3 feet (0.91 meters) across and weigh roughly 25 lb (11 kg). Their tails were similarly 3 feet (0.91 meters) and had one or more barbs near their base.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Like other species of ray, this creature tended to hide its body beneath the silt and sand of the seafloor so they could surprise their prey. Their cover themselves with sand or burrowing beneath it, which rendered them mostly camouflaged to other predators. However, because of this other creatures, such as humans , were often at risk of accidentally stepping upon them. They could be irritable, but were rather lethargic.</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>These creatures possessed a wide-angled vision. The barbed tails that gave sting rays their name contained a powerful, painful venom that induced nausea and a temporary state of paralysis.</p>

<h3>Habitats</h3>

<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Some druids that frequented aquatic environments were known to have sting rays as an animal companion . And some sea mages were known to keep them as familiars .</p>
