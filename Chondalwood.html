<p>Chondalwood was a large forest located in Chondath in the Vilhon Reach , stretching from the Nunwood to the Nagaflow River. It was also known as Satyrwood . The village of Elbulder was to the south of the forest.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The forest was once home to the green elf realm of Nikerymath . It contains the hidden city of Rucien-Xan .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Chondalwood was the home of wild elves .</p>
<p>As of 1368 DR , troops of satyrs patrolled the Old Road , scaring travelers into making haste out of the forest or to go around it, and the forest was also inhabited by voadkyn (wood giants) and centaurs . As of 1372 DR , savage druids lived in the forest and posed a threat to anyone approaching them. Clans of ghostwise halfling roamed about the forest, never staying in one spot for too long. Various plant creatures such as shambling mounds and tendriculos also lived here. All of these intelligent races had one goal in mind: to prevent human encroachment.</p>
<p>The Eldreth Veluuthra were active in this forest, and as of 1374 DR , generally received support from the forest's inhabitants such as the centaurs, ghostwise halflings and satyrs. The wild elves in the forest provided the organization's agents with shelter. Talindra Amalith of the Vel'Nikeryma (the Eldreth Veluuthra's guiding council) sought out new wild elf recruits in this area.</p>
