<p>Earthcaller was a heavy crystalline rod wielded by the avatar of Segojan Earthcaller .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This rod, which was effectively a heavy mace , was made of crystalline quartz .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Earthcaller had all the powers of a rod of smiting and had a pair of unique abilities. The heavy mace was able to create a powerful earthquake when it was struck against a surface, but only at the whim of the Lord of the Burrow. Its most unique ability was to summon a stone golem when pressed against a rock of at least 3,000 lb (1,400 kg). The stone golem would protect and serve Segojan Earthcaller for all of the day. These two powers could only be activated once per day, but seemed to have unlimited charges.</p>
