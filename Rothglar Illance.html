<h2>History</h2>
<p>Rothglar attended a feast in early Mirtul of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , in which he was seen by Amarune Whitewave listening close into some private converse.</p>
<p>Before the night when Marlin Stormserpent retrieved the Wyverntongue Chalice from the Royal Palace of Suzail , he'd bribed Verrin , one of Marlin's servants, and the disloyal man waited for Marlin at the end of the passage the latter used to get out of the castle. Marlazander was there with him; they had not unlocked the gate and were waiting for him. Marlin killed them too quickly, even from behind the bars, to learn what their intentions had been.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>There was a rumor, actually a manipulation by Marlin Stormserpent, that Rothglar, alongside Harmond Hawklin and Seszgar Huntcrown , were planning to unleash a some sort of "ball of Spellplague " from a chest during the Council of the Dragon .</p>
