<p>Silkstone was a fibrous variety of quartz similar to tiger eye .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This ornamental stone was found in many colors, yellow being the most common, and was cut cabochon , tumbled, or used for engravings such as seals for merchants and nobles. It exhibited faint highlights when light hit at certain angles. A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Like tiger eye, silkstone was worn as a protection from spirits, though this was more old wives' tale than fact. However, shadows were known to hesitate briefly when encountering someone wearing a silkstone, perhaps giving them time to flee. This property also made powdered silkstone a viable substitute component when casting spells related to life-energy drain and the restoration of those effects. It was also used in the creation of magical inks needed to make scrolls of those spells.</p>
