<p>The helm of hiding was an enchanted helmet that hid its wearer from magical prying.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It appeared to be a rather plain old war helm.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Per Laeral Rythkyn , a Harper wizard of note, it prevented all mental scrying on the wearer, hid them from searching magic, and allowed them to cloak themselves in shadow on command. The rest of the armor had other properties, but they were akin to so much shaped metal.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Laeral Rythkyn loaned the helm of hiding to her apprentice Blaskyn when she went off to find Thalon's Throne in mid- Kythorn of the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR . He used the helmet to sneak up on Laeral later and ambush her, after the Harper found Thalon's Throne .</p>
