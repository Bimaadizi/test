One of the victims left being a distinct-looking sacrificial dagger. The adventuring detective named Tav visited the construct smith of Trident Lane on Kythorn 30 , seeking the information on the possible murder weapon. The automaton claimed it didn't recognize the blade but a certain githyanki gravedigger attempted to custom-order such a blade.
