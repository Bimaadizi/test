<h2>History</h2>
<p>Brevin lived in Baldur's Gate and he was determined to become a member of Baldur's Gate's City Watch , but he was constantly confronted by prejudices regarding his race.</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century, Brevin got wind of a "training camp" organized by Enver Gortash that supposedly could help him make his way into the Watch. Brevin enrolled in it, but he did not get what he was looking for. Instead, his brain was extracted for experiments or usage in the Steel Watch project .</p>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Brevin's brain was put into a brain jar named Closed Mind that could be found in the Necrotic Laboratory of the Mind Flayer Colony beneath Moonrise Towers .</p>
