<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Eleint of the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR , the Dwarves of Destiny went into the Underdark in search of the lost Mielikkian treespeaker Elanalue Sharrith , who'd been captured by drow and taken into slavery years earlier, in the Year of the Snow Winds, 1335 DR . The holy Mielikkian spellbook known as Yornar's Trail Companion had gone missing with her. But the Dwarves of Destiny, like five other adventuring companies before them, had not returned as of 1368 DR .</p>
