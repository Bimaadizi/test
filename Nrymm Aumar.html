<p>Nrymm Aumar was the youngest of the Warring Princes of Athalantar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nrymm was very young when his father, and king, died and he was raised by the women of the court.</p>
<p>When magelords seized control, Nrymm disappeared. Magelord records indicated that he was turned into an otyugh by the magelords, then kept in the middens of Athalgard , the royal castle in Hastarl , so that they had another blood heir of Uthgrael in their power, other than Belaur Aumar .</p>
<p>Nrymm was slain in otyugh form in 238 DR by one of the mages hired by Felodar Aumar .</p>
