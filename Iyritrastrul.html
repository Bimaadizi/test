<p>Iyritrastrul was southern of the two islands that collectively were known as the Tusks .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Iyritrastrul islet was directly across from its bigger sister â€“ the island of Borammur . Both islands were nestled between the Starspire Peninsula to the south, the Dragon's Head Peninsula to the north, the part of the Trackless Sea called the Race to the west, and scenic Firedrake Bay to the east.</p>
<p>Iyritrastrul was occasionally used by damaged ships traveling across the Race, where they could perform necessary repairs using the islet's abundant shadowtops , duskwood , and blueleaf that grew on its southern side.</p>
