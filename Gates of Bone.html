<p>The Gates of Bone served as the main gate of Surcross , Thay as of the late 15 th century DR . The gates passed through the imposing Wall of Crypts which encircled the town.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The gate was comprised of the bones of a multitude of humanoids and beasts . They only opened or closed upon being commanded by a necromancer of sufficiently high rank within the Thayan military.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>If any living creature other than one with the authority to command the gate attempted to force the gates open—or even simply loitered near them for more than a few minutes—the bones would animate as an undead construct and attack. The skulls would hurl psychologically devastating insults and blasphemies, strengthened by an ability to search creatures' memories for weaknesses, while the limbs would reach and grasp at targets, immobilizing them and wracking their bodies with necromantic energies.</p>
<p>The Gates were resilient in the face of all attacks save for fire or radiant energies, the latter of which also weakened the Gates' grasping arms.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>If needed, the Gates could be reinforced instantly by Thayan soldiers arriving via teleportation circles from the city's Garrison .</p>
