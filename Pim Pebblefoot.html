<p>Pim Pebblefoot was a famed hin hero, active sometime in the mid-14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Pim hailed from a humble agricultural village in the small area known as the Gray Hills in the Savage Frontier . Selfless and brave young halfling archer , Pim gained renown and respect when he singlehandedly drove a band of fiends from his village's burial grounds. Soon, his good deeds made him a hero in the village and among the surrounding communities. He quickly became praised by his elders and swarmed by village girls, despite his withdrawn personality.</p>
<p>The halfling hero was always seen patrolling the Gray Hills, in any weather, day or night, any time of the year. He was often seen by the local shepherd standing tall (for a halfling) atop a hill overlooking the village and its fields, armed with his trusty bow and a puffing smoking pipe .</p>
<p>Unlike many fellow heroes, Pim Pebblefoot lived a long and glorious life. He spent some years among the Knights in Silver , fighting off orcish hoards, and drove out giants who invaded the nearby Evermoors . Sometime before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Pim Pebblefoot's life ended a the ripe old age of 135 years. His favorite enchanted boots – The Sturdy Feet of Pim , were inherited by Pim's great-nephew, an aspiring adventurer named Prand Pebblefoot who was last seen heading to the Jewel of the North – the city of Neverwinter .</p>
