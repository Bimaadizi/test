<h2>History</h2>
<p>Decision was the family heirloom blade belonging to a wealthy family of Neverwinter. When the Jewel of the North entered the war with its bitter rival neighbor Luskan in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , led by traitor Aribeth de Tylmarande , Anali's family attempted to ship her to Waterdeep . She was to be wed to a wealthy merchant family scion in the City of Splendors, away from Neverwinter. Anali much preferred to stand and die in defense of her home. She grabbed Decision off the wall and stormed off. As the war raged on, Anali Cyl became a famous General, wielding the family blade in battle.</p>
<p>By the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , General Anali Cyl's falchion fell into the hands of Aldanon , Sage of Neverwinter. The magic sword was stored in the basement of his manse in the Blacklake District .</p>
