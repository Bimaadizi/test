<p>Lundeth was a village made up of sun-fire clay huts in the desert of Anauroch .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This village scaled the steep sides of a rock pinnacle surrounded by the Salt Flats and had a deep water well. It was a day's ride away from the southwestern edge of the Sword .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This village was once founded and inhabited by a Bedine tribe named the Goldor . Sometime prior to 1360 DR , the Zhentarim assaulted the village with their magical prowess and seized it as a base for their western operations.</p>
<p>From then on, Zhent caravans in Anauroch would often try to find their way to this village when they ran into trouble. And the Melial , a mixed community of hobgoblins and orcs , sometimes attempted raids on the village.</p>
<p>Eventually, after many years, once the Black Road was completed the Zhentarim abandoned this village.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Around the 1360's DR , the inhabitants of this village were made up of members of the Zhentarim and the undead remains of the Goldor tribe. The latter numbered around twenty minor magelings and underpriests.</p>
<p>After the construction of the Black Road was finished, the Zhentarim members stationed in Lundeth left. All that remained within the village were those undead remnants of the Goldor.</p>
