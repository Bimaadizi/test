<p>Wheat was a grain-producing grass commonly cultivated throughout Faerûn and valued more than rice in regions where both could be grown.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>The Heartlands of Faerûn were the main producers of grains such as wheat, barley , and rye . The Dalelands were another verdant region of Faerûn that produced plentiful harvests of wheat and other grains. The Abbey of the Golden Sheaf in Mistledale harvested various crops grown on strict rotation. On such crop was wheat of supreme quality. Meanwhile, in the nation of Cormyr , wheat was grown in the farms of Kirinwood and Immersea , sold on the markets of Wheloon from the town's sizable fields, and exported from Ghars .</p>
<p>Areas of Tethyr responsible from crop production were south of the Sulduskoon River and west of Darromar . In Amn , the former site of Myth Lharast was used as a wheat field in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<p>In the Vilhon Reach , the independent city-state of Lheshayl and the small town of Urml on the Shining Plains had farms that produced wheat and rice, while in the Blade Kingdoms wheat fields were maintained by the city-state of Lomatra .</p>
<p>The Great Dale region of the Unapproachable East was home to numerous farmers from Impiltur who cultivated hardy crops including wheat. The Red Wizard nation of Thay used slave labor to maintain its grain fields, which included wheat. Thay also was home of at least one species of wild wheat.</p>
<p>The nation of Var the Golden was renowned for its flowing fields of golden wheat. The sun-kissed plains of Durpar and Estagund also housed large fields of the crop.</p>
<p>On the Moonshae Isles , the isle of Snowdown 's farms produced grains and cattle, including wheat. Some minor wheat farming was gone on Norheim and on Oman .</p>
<p>Ground wheat flour and unmilled wheat berries were sold through Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue for 3 gold pieces per 1 pound (450 grams) for flour and 2 gp per pound of wheat berries.</p>
<p>Outside of the Prime Material plane , wheat was grown and turned into baked goods on the planes of Bytopia and Arborea . The plane of Elysium was known for its green wheat used in making bread.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Wheat grains were used in making wheat flour . The grains were dried and ground in gristmills using massive stone wheels or smaller querns . Some of these stones were moved by horses or other beasts of burden, by wind, or by water. Wheat breads were among the most commonly baked products and a single loaf could be valued at six copper pieces .</p>
<p>Saurials of the Lost Vale made a strange dish out of heavily-spiced ground wheat.</p>
<p>Inhabitants of the High Desert in Zakhara used wheat flour to make fried battan , fish found in the Al-Adib River .</p>
<p>Wheat was used to make a wide variety of golden ales and beers , including Annasker , Belbuck , Darndarr , Helmatoss , Zeskorr , and many others.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Wheat rust was a devastating, quick-spreading blight that affected crops such as wheat, barley , rye , spelt , oats , bran , and timothy in the ancient lands of Netheril . The red mold covered their stalks and rotted the grains from the inside. In 3165 NY (−694 DR) , the arcanist Candlemas devised a magical cure for the blight that managed to spread and halt the disease.</p>
