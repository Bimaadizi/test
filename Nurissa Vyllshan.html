<p>Nurissa Vyllshan was a female drow illusionist and shadow adept and the leader of the School of the Shadow Weave in the city of Sshamath in the year 1372 DR .</p>
<p>She petitioned the Conclave of Sshamath to have a position on the conclave as leader of the shadow adepts. However, the Conclave denied them for fear of losing political influence by adding another member to the conclave, and because they distrusted the shadow adepts, many of whom worshiped Shar . However, the Conclave could not deny their arcane power, and would prefer to keep the mages in view than in the shadows.</p>
