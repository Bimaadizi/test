<p>Percival was an intelligent squirrel and very close friend of Cadderly Bonaduce . He gained the respect of many adventurers, and was even highly praised by druids .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Although he was a squirrel, Percival was incredibly perceptive, able and loyal to Cadderly and his friends. The white squirrel could comprehend some words and phrases of Common . He was said to be a "most excellent beast" by Arcite , a visiting druid to the Edificant Library .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The small creature enjoyed the company of Cadderly, as well as the cacasa nuts, butter and acorns the young priest would feed him.</p>
<p>Cadderly's bond to Percival became so strong that the priest gained abilities of the creature, and could even sprout white squirrel limbs to climb and leap across terrain, which a human would usually find impossible to traverse, with ease and speed.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Percival had a wealth of achievements during his life, including directly, and indirectly, saving the lives of hundreds of good people, if not more.</p>
<p>Percival saved Cadderly's life from that of his rival, Kierkan Rufo , when he confronted Cadderly with a knife. The squirrel had dexterously hopped from window to window to plant his body into Rufo's face as a distraction, giving Cadderly time to act.</p>
<p>The squirrel greatly aided in the effort to save the Edificant Library from the evil cleric , Barjin , who wished to release the Chaos Curse . To do this, he watched the suspicious movements of those in the library, particularly the groundskeeper, Mullivy , whom the squirrel despised. Furthermore, he led Danica and the druid Newander to the tunnels where Mullivy had been lured; Newander commented how remarkable the squirrel was. The squirrel then sniffed out the path to Pikel Bouldershoulder , who was resurrected by the druid, and then to Cadderly, who with the help of the others, defeated Barjin. When the first threat was dealt with, Percival hibernated until about a year later. Here, Percival investigated the corruption of the library by undead , and traveled to Shilmista forest to get the help of Shayleigh , the elven ranger. He led her to the library, which helped end the final threat.</p>
<p>Percival also saved Cadderly's lover, Danica, from death several times: first during Barjin's assault on the library, and secondly from Rufo in his vampiric form.</p>
