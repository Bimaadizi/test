<p>Belabranta ( pronounced : /ˈ b ɛ l ɑː b r ɑː n t ɑː / BEL-ah-brahn-tah ) was among the oldest noble houses of Waterdeep , being officially ennobled in 952 DR . They were famous griffon breeders, trainers and even hunters.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The family owned a villa in the Sea Ward , on the northeast corner of Mendever Street and Rough Road .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before House Belabranta became an official noble house of Waterdeep it could claim one of its members as a hero of the city. Ilithrew Belabranta was a famous griffon rider and hero of the second Trollwar . During that time he amassed a small fortune by plundering slain troll hoards. With some of those funds he was able to commission the construction of the Griffontack of Belabranta , a set of magical items passed down to future generations.</p>
<p>During an attack by an orc horde, known as the Black Claw , upon Waterdeep in 1026 DR , now Lord Palinor Belabranta took to the skies on his griffon steed, only to be brought low by a volley of orc arrows. He and his mount crashed into the orc ranks and it was thought the Griffontack of Belabranta was lost forever.</p>
<p>For quite some time, Lord Huld had an affair with a courtesan at the House of Purple Silks within the city's Sea Ward . Unfortunately, he was unaware that his lover was actually a succubus named Elinaera . Some time before 1372 DR , the Lord and the fiend had a falling out and got into a fight. While the fiendess was able to deal Lord Huld a mortal wound, the wizard of House Belabranta banished Elinaera from Toril . Just before he died, the lord's mind was consumed by a greater doppelganger of the Unseen who assumed his form and took over leadership of the noble house.</p>
<p>Around 1372 DR, the Griffontack of Belabranta was recovered from the vault of House Ilvastarr . Lord Moedt Belabranta hired adventurers to break into the Ilvastarr Vault and prove the family’s age-long suspicion that a member of House Ilvastarr looted the artifacts from the fallen Lord Palinor.</p>
