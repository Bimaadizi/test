<p>The ring of the wood elves was a unique enchanted elegant silver band created by the wood elves of Neverwinter Wood sometime before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The ring 's only enchantment was protection against spells – it boosted the wearer's resistance to magics aimed at them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The ring was crafted by the wood elves of Neverwinter Wood as the reward for young Lady Aribeth de Tylmarande , a once-revered hero who hailed from the village of Thundertree . Aribeth was instrumental in saving her hometown from a power-hungry mage from Luskan . Ansal Bloodshoulder , the informal leader of Thundertree at the time, presented the ring of the wood elves to Aribeth and the band became the hero's dearest possession. Hover, when Aribeth set out to become a paladin of Tyr , the Just God, she felt the need to break from her past. The hero thought she had to shed parts of herself to free up space for the deity's divine light and for Tyr to find her unburdened. The ring of the wood elves was one of the parts of herself the paladin chose to discard and, for one reason or another, she no longer recognized the ring as hers.</p>
<p>Since then, the ring of the wood elves passed several hands. One of the ring's owners was Aryvindaire , a trader and a leader of a wood elven gang that resided within the Neverwinter Wood in the late 14 th century DR, sometime after the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR .</p>
