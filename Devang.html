<p>Devang was a vizier and counselor of Rajah Jasraj Seltrarir as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Vizier Devang dwelt within Seltrarir Palace , and had a corrupting influence on the rajah, who trusted his vizier greatly. In truth, Devang was secretly a rakshasa and served the rajah of Tirumala .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During or shortly before the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Devang persuaded Rajah Seltrarir to sign a trade agreement with Tirumala. Given that city's evil reputation, this move was seen as so bewildering to the people of Estagund that many assumed their ruler had been either magically manipulated or replaced by a rakshasa.</p>
