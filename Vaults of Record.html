<p>The Vaults of Record were an ancient Okothian ruin that had long ago been plundered as of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The ruins were part of the broader Ruins of the Serpent Kings found near the village of Buldamar along the eastern shore of Azulduth , the Lake of Salt, in southeast Faer√ªn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The ruins were first discovered during the early days of the empires of Mulhorand and Unther and promptly plundered for the treasure they contained. These magical discoveries were used to bolster the magical might of the two empires.</p>
<p>By the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , a fair number of eager adventurers explored the ruins with hopes of find treasure missed by countless others. This trend continued through the late 15 th century DR, largely driven by tales told by businesses in Buldamar eager to bring in scavengers and explorers as customers.</p>
