<p>The scarlet and blue ioun stone was a unique ioun stone that once belonged to a legendary goblin Chief Geraq .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The scarlet and blue ioun stone boosted its owner's intelligence and contained the knowledge of lore and legends of its former owners, most notably, Chief Geraq. The stone whispered Geraq's knowledge and experience, but only those who were versed in Goblin language found that whispering helpful.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The origins of the scarlet and blue ioun stone were unknown, but the first known owner of the stone was the goblin Chief Geraq, who famously, or infamously, led the Swivelback tribe, using the stone's intelligence-boosting magics to devise strategies, plan the resource usage, and knowledge of obscure lore. Despite there being no information about where the goblin found the stone, he never parted with the artifact. Eventually, Geraq mysteriously disappeared but his voice was preserved in the magic stone itself. Individuals who held the stone could hear Geraq's whispers in the Goblin language, sharing his experiences and knowledge with those willing to listen.</p>
