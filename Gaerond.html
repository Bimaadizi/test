<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gaerond led the Bloodshields Band into Shadowdale in 1479 DR , on commission from a rich Sembian who had paid a large amount upfront, looking for Elminster Aumar , the ancient archmage. Gaerond came first upon the Old Skull Inn , where he was able to commission the youngster Thal , actually a doppelganger , to lead him to Elminster. Thal took them to a cave, where Gaerond met a doppelganger pretending to be Elminster; when they revealed they actually intended to decapitate Elminster and carry his head as a trophy to Sembia, a number of hidden doppelgangers fired a volley of crossbows into the band, slaying them almost on the spot. Gaerond was the last to die, though not by a great difference.</p>
