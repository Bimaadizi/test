<p>The Temple of Mystra was a great Cormyrean cathedral dedicated to the Mother of All Magic, the goddess Mystra , located in the King's Forest near the town of Eveningstar . It was built sometime in the late 14 th century DR , and abandoned after Mystra's death and the Spellplague that followed, after which it was claimed as a base by drow .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple was built under the tree canopies, close to the northern edge of the King's Forest, on the western shores of the Starwater River south of Eveningstar.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The temple was built both above and below ground, above and below a large hill. By the late 15 th century DR, the above-ground structure was mostly crumbled and ruined, and the underground was partially collapsed. The hillside entrance opened into a large columned atrium with a waterfall trickling water into the reflecting pool at its center, and from there the temple split into hallways, all leading into different parts of the complex. One path led to an altar to Mystra with glowing silver stars still shining down on the chamber even after the deity's demise. Another path led to a library of texts on the Arcane. And another one opened up into a cathedral's main ceremonial hall. The latter ruins were outfitted with extensive slave pens and corrals, as well as various fortifications, gates, and spell wards to offer the drow base protection against do-gooders and prevent escapes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Temple of Mystra was abandoned after the goddess' demise in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , and was left ruined and forgotten until the drow threat rose in the Year of the Awakened Sleepers, 1484 DR . Although most of Lolth's schemes were focused elsewhere, the Spider Queen Lolth had her eyes on the small community of Eveningstar, and it was targeted by drow raiders from the Underdark city of Sschindylryn . Members of the drow houses Szind and Avithoul used the ruins of the Temple of Mystra as a base from which to capture slaves from Eveningstar, including commoners, War Wizards , and Purple Dragons alike, and shackled them with enchanted slave collars . Apart from capturing slaves, the drow were tasked by their goddess with finding the "Thread of the Weave," a fragment of the Weave torn from Mystra in the Spellplague.</p>
<p>Unaware of the threat, a band of Evenor youngsters made up of Cormul Haythorne , Torin Betrich , and Ana Brabener decided that the "Thread of the Weave" was surely hidden in the ruined temple and ventured out, only to be attacked by drow slavers, with Ana being taken and Cormul and Torin escaping. During her capture, young Ana showed an impressive magical gift , piquing the interest of her new masters.</p>
<p>While Torin stayed look for her, Cormul returned to Eveningstar and told Elminster and a band of adventurers from the world of Eberron of the capture. With the Old Sage's blessing, the outworlders set out to rescue the captured Ana and slay the slavers. When they arrived, they were attacked by the magically controlled folk of Eveningstar, driven by their slave masters, though they were able to be freed. Along the way in, they encountered the drow wizard Eldrin Szind , who was busy looting the temple and took a moment to realize that he was under attack. Though he used magic scrolls from the abandoned library to summon elementals , he was defeated all the same.</p>
<p>After much combat, the adventurers came across a chamber where Ana Brabener was being interrogated over the magics she had displayed during her capture. Her captor Odezzt Avithoul sent Ana and other slaves into combat against her rescuers, but the foul slavemaster was slain nevertheless. After the fight, Ana's horror at the situation let her break out of her own collar, much to her shock. The heroes and Ana then had to fight through a great many drow to escape the temple, with Ana using her strange gift to break the magical barriers that were being thrown up to trap them. Finally, the drider slaver Phargred Avithoul attempted to block their escape, but was cut down in the process.</p>
<p>Among the treasures recovered from the temple were an archaic device that functioned like a rune arm , and an ancient gemstone that could be used as a docent , both strange and esoteric magical items.</p>
