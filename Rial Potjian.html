<p>Rial was born in the land of Calimshan to a minor noble family of the city of Calimport . During his youth he came to be disillusioned by the decadence of both his family and the ruling class of Calimport. This eventually prompted him to take up the practice of magic and adventuring .</p>
<p>Rial's travels took him to the land of Amn , where a gnome diviner by the name of Aberdeen Krestner joined his adventuring company. During one adventure, when fighting drow they encountered within the ruined city of Monrativi Teshy Mir , they caused a wild magic surge that transported them both far away to the ruins Myth Drannor .</p>
<p>Soon after fighting their way out of Myth Drannor, they met a fellow diviner by the name of Saldo Presto . They came to adventure together for nearly a decade, until deciding to settle down in the city of Ravens Bluff. There they got a residence close to the city's Diviner's Guild and devoted much of their time to the study of tomes .</p>
<p>After thwarting the plans of a Red Wizard of Thay that they had overheard in a tavern, the trio earned the respect of the Lord Mayor Charles Oliver O'Kane and were elected guildmasters of the Diviner's Guild by unanimous vote.</p>
