<p>Cora Peytir was one of the Blades of Mulmaster .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>In addition to her duties as a Blade, Cora managed her family business of lumberyards and mills.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1491 DR , a series of strange quakes damaged only House Peytir 's holdings, so she hired some adventurers to investigate the matter.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Cora knew that her hold on power was tenuous at best, but she enjoyed her position and the attention she received. Cora easily saw through raw flattery, but could sometimes overlook the agenda of those who were exceedingly deferential to her status as a Blade. She always conducted reasoned negotiations but did not shy away from threats of financial ruin or implied violence.</p>
