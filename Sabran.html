<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sabran joined the caravan from Scornubel to Waterdeep in which Shandril Shessair sought passage on late 1357 DR . He presented himself as a weaver instead of a priest, and concealed some horse armor as contraband, despite the fact he was undercover. He remained undercover through the ambush at Haelhollow , not taking part in the battle.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the fight, they tried to capture Shandril while she was out of spellfire and knocked out, guarded only by Narm Tamaraith , but decided against it when she woke up too soon. However, they were then ambushed by the Harpers Beldimarr and Arauntar , who were posing as caravan guards, and got their necks broken. This left them unseen to the Zhentarim scriers Hlael Toraunt and Korthauvar Hammantle . for much of a day. Unknown to the Harpers, he survived thanks to a contingent spell.</p>
<p>He was slain during the caravan's next ambush, by Marlel .</p>
