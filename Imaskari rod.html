<p>An Imaskari rod was a magical rod of Imaskari origin that was used to dispel magic , so as to better fight all things divine and druidic .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These rods were used to cast a powerful greater dispel magic spell three times a day.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Despite being in common use by the ancient Imaskari Empire , most of the rods were long lost to the ages by the late 14 th century DR . One of Imaskari rods could be found in the ruins underneath the Bear God's Barrow , home to the great spirit Okku in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR . This particular rod was damaged and cracked along its length and somehow radiated the feeling of being alive.</p>
