<p>Unity was a Netherese city during the time of ancient Netheril .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Unity was founded in the early 600s NY (around −3260 DR ) and served to defend against goblins.</p>
<p>Unity was the site for the largest of all temples constructed for the glory of Amaunator —the Forested Enclave of the Face of the Sun . This towering structure soared 17 stories into the sky and was visible for miles around.</p>
<p>In 3348 NY (−511 DR) , Unity was successfully attacked by the bandit lord Olostin , starting his 33 year reign of terror.</p>
<p>In 3499 NY (−360 DR) , the city was besieged by extra-planar fiends, who waged a three-year war for the city before being banished or killed by Karsus .</p>
<p>In the spring of 3514 NY (−345 DR) , magically mutated creatures began coming out of the Far Horns Forest near Unity, believed to be caused by Karsus's use of heavy magic during the war against the fiends.</p>
