<p>Nightwarden Minthara Baenre was a True Soul and a leader within the cult of the Absolute in the late 15 th century DR . She later broke free of the Absolute's control and developed an intense hatred for her former master, channeling her powers to oppose it.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The drow had a stern countenance and medium-length silver-white hair kept in a messy bun, with two strands adorning the sides of her face. She had light purple skin and a tattoo of House Baenre's symbol on the left side of her neck. She weighted 75kg (165lbs). When at ease, Minthara wore slim black leather pants with flat black and purple ankle boots. Her voice was low, regal and steady.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Minthara oversaw the raids and attacks the cult made as an extension of the Absolute's will. She believed anyone not dedicated to the Absolute was a mere infidel.</p>
<p>Despite her strong and willful exterior, Minthara held feelings of great fear that she kept hidden deep within her psyche. From her perspective, she learned to harness this fear and strengthen her will.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like others of her kind, Minthara shared a psychic connection with the other "True Souls" of the Absolute. She bore a brand of the Absolute, such as those that were offered by High Priestess Gut .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>She wore a stylized suit of drow leather armor along with an amulet of misty step and wielded the unique mace Xyanyde .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>True Soul Minthara was responsible for scouting operations as well as the interrogation of its prisoners.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Throughout her whole life, Minthara experienced significant loss. Many members of her family, along with her friends and former lovers, were all killed at the hands of others. Minthara's first lover was a High Priestess from the drow House Vandree of Menzoberranzan. She thought the priestess to be beautiful, elegant, and ruthless. The two adored each other, and their relationship lasted for some time until Minthara received an order to end the High Priestess. Minthara poisoned her lover and stayed at her side, whispering words of comfort until the priestess died.</p>
<p>Minthara controlled a camp of goblin minions alongside their High Priestess Gut, and the hobgoblin warlord Dror Ragzlin . She was directly served by the cult's torturer Spike , as well as their head scout Rozzak . The goblin named Klagga was infatuated with Minthara and often fantasized about her. Klagga hoped to spill enough blood in raids to attract the attention of the Absolute and, in turn, Minthara's.</p>
<p>While under the Absolute's control, Minthara adored and faithfully served Orin , but her own mind deeply despised the changeling for enthralling her into the Absolute's service.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Minthara received a tough and cruel upbringing. Born into the House Baenre of Menzoberranzan , she survived her first assassination attempt while a newborn, suckling on her mother's breast. Her mother protected the newborn and received a dagger wound while protecting her daughter. Later, Minthara claimed that day she tasted her mother's blood mixed with milk . Years later, Minthara's own mother attempted to assassinate her and received a scar to match the one received while protecting the newborn drow.</p>
<p>Minthara's indoctrination into the Absolutist fate began through manipulation. The cult sent an envoy, two worshippers of the new deity. They arrived at Menzoberranzan preaching the Absolute's love. Of course, the emissaries were murdered, and their corpses became a grotesque decoration. These cultists, however, did their job. Their audacity bothered Minthara greatly. She gathered a band of loyal fighters to pay the cult a visit. When she arrived at the Moonrise Towers , Minthara was greeted with praise and fanfare as a guest of honor instead of an enemy. A feast followed, thrown in Minthara's honor, during which Orin the Red, one of the cult's leaders, danced across the table, cutting the necks of Minthara's men open. The drow woman was the only survivor, favored by Orin as the shapeshifter's new toy. She personally took Minthara into the towers' cellars and held the drow as the Absolute infected her with a mind flayer tadpole, making Minthara a True Soul .</p>
<p>The mental control of the Absolute deluded Minthara's mind. She found herself being almost infatuated by Orin the Red. The drow eagerly absorbed the shapeshifter's every word and took up arms in service of the new goddess.</p>
<p>When an illithid nautiloid crashed near the River Chionthar in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Minthara and Dror Ragzlin sent out goblin search parties to recover a mysterious artifact . The pair also sought the whereabouts of a group of individuals granted powers by the Absolute but who had not yet been made into True Souls.</p>
<p>A short time later, she orchestrated the cult's raid on the Waukeen's Rest inn, along with the attempted abduction of Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard to the cult's fortress at Moonrise Towers.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, she sought to launch an assault on the nearby Emerald Grove , believing they were in possession of the artifact the Absolute desired.</p>
