<p>Volun was a mysterious floating skull, an undead creature and the familiar of Caalenfaire 's who guided the heroes from Phlan , the Veiled Ones , on their quest to stop the nefarious plans of the Cult of the Dragon in 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Unlike her master, Volun could communicate freely with clarity of mind unobscured with divinations. She often worked as an interpreter of sorts, covering confusing information dispensed by Caalenfaire. Despite being a floating head, she was snappy and witty. She showed great interest in arcane, her masters' predictions, and music.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Volun was a floating humanoid skull with elven decorative bounds and gems; her eyes glowed with arcane energy.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>In life, Volun was a powerful wizard and the adversary of Caalenfaire's. The extent of her abilities as an undead skull were unknown.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Volun lived a long time before the advent of the Weeping War in Myth Drannor . She was a powerful wizard, one of the Speculum . Her bitter rival diviner Caalenfaire eventually gave his mortal life in his obsessive pursuit of secrets. Eventually, Volun ended up a floating enchanted skull, bound to her rival as a familiar. Together, they existed within one of the Speculum's hidden vaults, searching for knowledge of the future.</p>
<p>In 1369 DR , Caalenfaire and Volun were led by the prophetic Song of Faer√ªn performed by the mysterious Bard of Kara-Tur at the dawn of the 14 th century DR . The song's fragments and verses reached the undead duo's ears and revealed themselves as the events in the ruins transpired. The song told them about the corruption of the city's mytha , imprisonment of its keeper, the Cult of the Dragon 's plans of domination of the Moonsea region. The Song told them to expect a group of heroes. When heroes from Phlan made their way through the ruins and came across the undead diviners, Volun realized that her master's divination did not come to pass, they strayed from the Path, and their future became uncertain and clouded in darkness. They became the Veiled Ones . Volun advised them to search for the allies within the ruins. The prophesied event could still happen if the heroes could find Odelinde the Golden Serpent, Dwarf Lord Harldain Ironbar , and the Sisters of Silver Fire .</p>
<p>Eventually, their help aided the Veiled Ones in defeating the Cult, sending Kya Mordrayn to the Abyss , destroying her dracolich ally (unbeknownst to the Veiled Ones, another group of adventurers aided them in this by destroying Pelendralaar 's phylactery ), and restoring the mythal by creating the new gem of the weave and giving it the new guardian, Anorrweyn Evensong .</p>
<p>Once the order was returned to the ruins, the new verse reached Caalenfaire and Volun from the undead's divination bowl. The song of praise for the Veiled Ones and their successes sang almost 400 years in the past.</p>
