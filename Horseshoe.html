<p>Horseshoes (or simply shoes ) were a type of metal footwear designed specifically to counteract the wear and tear on the hooves of domesticated horses , who experienced it at an accelerated rate because of carrying the weight of riders and other equipment.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Horseshoes were typically made of an iron or steel bar and hammered into a "U" shape. They were attached to horses by nailing them into their hooves, a process that was known as "shoeing."</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Horses equipped with these were capable of traveling farther, faster, and for much longer.</p>
<p>When a horse's shoe became loosened, it made a clattering sound as it walked or ran. If the shoe came off completely, they were said to "throw a shoe" or "lose a shoe", and the horse was forced to slow and limp until it was replaced.</p>
