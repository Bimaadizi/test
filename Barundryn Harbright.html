<p>Barundryn Harbright was an explorer in the mid–8 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He had a low opinion of wizards, but could be quite cheery to his friends.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He became a landlord to Thessamel Arunder in 767 DR . He was also a follower of the One True Path , and an old friend of Esbre Felmorel .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The man had immense muscles, being bull-like in the breadth of his chest. His arms were not just buff, but hairy. His formal dress included a purple robe and a high golden belt and bracers with scenes of men wrestling lions . His golden codpiece, too, was engraved with similar scenes.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He was quite wealthy, and wielded an enchanted broadsword .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Barundryn Harbright was a guest at one of Esbre Felmorel's banquets in the spring of the Year of Laughter, 761 DR , together with Lord of Spells Thessamel Arunder and a wandering stranger, Wanlorn . During the talk, Harbright claimed that the One True Path, of which he was a member, already held power in a dozen towns, and needed a realm next. Later, as Wanlorn made his exit in the dead of the night, Barundryn Harbright was impassively looking at him and nodding in approval, though the wanderer did not know this.</p>
<p>About two tendays into the chaos of the Art in the Year of the Awakening Wyrm, 767 DR , Barundryn Harbright backed a high offer for South Spire , the tower of Thessamel Arunder, thus becoming his landlord. He gave the diminished wizard a dressing down while revealing himself.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>During the Feast together with Wanlorn, Barundryn claimed that the people of Myth Drannor had attempted to gain godhood as the Netherese did before them, and that was the cause of their fall. At the very least, that was untrue.</p>
