<p>The Himasla Mountains were a mountain range in Malatra in southern Kara-Tur . They marked the southernmost limit of the Kuong Kingdom and separated Malatra from the western and southern lands.</p>
<p>The mountain range was rugged and quite poorly explored, and emerged out of the densest jungle in all Malatra.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a trade road ran through its foothills. In the mid–14 th century DR , this was guarded by the Kuong fortress-town of Garuji , whose garrison patrolled the road and fought with the buso of the mountains.</p>
