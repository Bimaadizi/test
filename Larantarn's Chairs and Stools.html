<p>Larantarn's Chairs and Stools was the shop of the master carpenter and furniture-maker Ommagol Larantarn of Sundabar , circa 1365 DR .</p>
<p>Specializing in, as his shop's name states, wooden chairs and stools, Ommagol was so skilled in his craft he could craft a chair, and immediately follow up with an exact duplicate, without referring to the original.</p>
<p>Ommagol's shop featured heavy tapestries that hung upon the walls, and scattered across the floor. As he would turn chair legs on the lathe , Ommagol would fling them over his shoulder while drinking wine and singing.</p>
