<p>Selvar was a skilled mage from Taruin in Samarach who lived some time before the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Selvar developed a feud with another mage named Phelpar of Rassatan . Phelpar initially got the upper hand on Selvar and polymorphed him into a frog for several years, during which time Phelpar stole all of his spells and magic items . But Selvar was determined to get his revenge and hopped his way for many miles across Samarach to the mountains where he had hidden a magical cache. He was able to regain his normal form because of the magic stored here.</p>
<p>Selvar was eventually able to trap Phelpar with his magic and gave him a taste of his own medicine by polymorphing him into a horse which he rode to death. He then used his magic to speak with Phelpar's corpse to find the location of his lost stolen magic. He traveled to a tomb in the Rathgaunt Hills along the southern edge of the Shaar . He collected his lost work and penned Selvar's Ineffable Conjurations, Magicks, and Phantasms , a book of spells. Before his death Selvar gave the work to a young woman named Ilistar who would later become an apprentice of Khelben Arunsun .</p>
