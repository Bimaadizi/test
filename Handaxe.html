<p>Handaxes were a type of light, martial melee weapon in the axe family.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Handaxes were similar to hatchets in size and shape. Their shafts were usually made of wood, though metal was sometimes used. Their blades were single-edged and their back sides were either unadorned, spiked, or had a peen. Handaxes were heavier than throwing axes and not balanced enough to be used effectively as a thrown weapon.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>Classified as a light weapon, handaxes were often used while grappling an opponent. Because some training was required to use them effectively as an off-hand weapon in conjunction with another, they were typically considered as martial weapons.</p>
