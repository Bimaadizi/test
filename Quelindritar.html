<p>Quelindritar , also known as Wardancer , was a bronze dragon who had lived in the Moonsea her entire life, and one of Karasendrieth 's rogues. She was also a member of the Talons of Justice during the battle against Sammaster at the end of 1373 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On Kythorn 6 of 1373 DR , she was one of the proponents of the theory that it was the Zhentarim in Thentia that summoned the chasme that slew Sinylla Zoranyian while disrupting the efforts of the mages of Thentia to decrypt Sammaster 's notes, and she suggested acting immediately, irrespective of any confirmation. She eventually relented at the request of Sinylla's kin.</p>
<p>During the final battle against Sammaster on Nightal 7 of that same year, Quelindritar was one the Talons that were sent to attack Sammaster's citadel. She was one of the few Talons who survived the battle.</p>
