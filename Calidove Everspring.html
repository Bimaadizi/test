<p>Calidove Everspring was one of the Harper commanders in charge during the Harper- Reithwin conflict in the Western Heartlands of the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When General Ketheric Thorm started an almost-successful campaign to wipe out Selûnite sympathies and took over absolute tyrannical control of the Reithwin town, the winter of the 1373 DR , ended up in an armed conflict between the Dark Justiciars under Ketheric and the Harper, allied with the Emerald Enclave . In that conflict, Calidove Everspring was one of the Harper commanders. One of pieces of historical documents preserved from the was an interrogation transcript penned by Luna Shorn . It recorded the interrogation of Dahl Timber , an alleged spy for the Sharrans , despite his claim of being just a potato farmer. Calidove zealously pushed the farmer to reveal the number of troops stationed on Reithwin's southern walls. When Dahl was unable or unwilling to disclose, Calidove ordered the transcriber to record the spy's refusal to cooperate and the harsher methods of interrogation to come.</p>
