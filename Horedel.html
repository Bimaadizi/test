<h2>Relationships</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Horedel died from disease in the Year of the Cockatrice, 1248 DR , twenty years after his father established himself in the Korinn Archipelago. He was interred in a tomb within the catacombs beneath the Manor of the Sea King on Viledel's Isle . Per the customs of his father's homeland of Petathal , he was wrapped in linen burial clothes and placed in a 30‑foot-long (9.1‑meter) galley filled with grave-goods, including gold , weapons , armor , and servants. This was all sealed behind a brick wall adorned with a bronze plaque bearing an inscribed epitaph.</p>
<p>When Viledel and Liala were slain two decades later, they were laid to rest in the catacombs near Horedel's crypt.</p>
