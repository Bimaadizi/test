<p>Kaulvaeras Stables was a large horse farm located on the western side of Ashabenford , right on the east bank of the River Ashaba , in the late 14 th century DR . These renowned stables offered some of the finest horses in the Dalelands , and was run by one their better horse breeders, Kaulvaeras Greymantle . They set very fair prices, considering the quality of their steeds.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Kaulvaeras Stables selection of mounts only included ponies , horses, and sometime warhorses, personally bred and reared by Kaulvaeras himself. Anyone looking to trade in a lame mount would receive a discount on their purchase. Kaulvaeras was far too soft-hearted to put down any tired horses and instead set them out to pasture.</p>
