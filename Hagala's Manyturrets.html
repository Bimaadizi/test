<p>This inn rented out their rooms at a price of 1 silver piece per person for each night, though one could instead opt to pay 8 silver pieces to stay for a tenday . This rental fee did not provide any food, though Hagala's always had tankards of cold ale and bowls of hot soup on offer at a cost of 1 copper piece .</p>
