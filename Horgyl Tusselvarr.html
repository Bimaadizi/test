<p>Horgyl Tusselvarr was the Magister from 1153 DR to 1204 DR .</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>He was robust, and his nose had a hooked profile. His mien was described as cold and menacing, with flinty eyes.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was not in the habit of meeting the eyes of gods.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After he caught Olohmber Starnardyn in the explosion of a booby trapped trio of staves, Horgyl challenged and slew him, becoming the Magister. As the Magister, he gave magic only to the most inept of apprentices, and periodically stole the best spells of other wizards, destroying their creations, and setting their allies against them. To Azuth , he claimed to do this in order to spur them to greater heights of sorcery.</p>
<p>In parallel, Horgyl started work on a series of power gauntlets : enchanted gauntlets with a number of powers, which he claimed would grant rulers and knights a love of what magic could do for them, sparing wizards from the task of using such in the battlefield. The gauntlets' final powers were unknown by the 14 th century, because Azuth stole all six pairs of them and a seventh pair he designed to be operable by himself alone. The Magister never identified the culprit, even after numerous chases; the High One did it so as to spur him in turn to greater and greater creations just as he claimed to do to lesser mages.</p>
<p>Horgyl was finally slain by a challenger who employed spells to swallow him in a crevice and close it violently enough to crush or entomb him.</p>
