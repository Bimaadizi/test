<p>The Great Padishate of the Marid , or the Marid Padishate , was the collective term referring to the ruling body of government of the marids .</p>
<p>Marids were less organized as an official government when compared to the djinn , but their greater power ensured that they held greater control over the Elemental Plane of Water than the djinn did on the Elemental Plane of Air .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Great Padisha of the Marid, Kalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari , ruled over all of the noble marids comprising the Padishate.</p>
<p>Each and every marid claimed nobility of some sort, but only the truly noble marid served the Padisha and schemed to replace her one day.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls on the Elemental Plane of Water served as the seat of power for the Marid Padishate.</p>
