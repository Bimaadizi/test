<p>Sharora Leonala was a member of the Cormanthor Elves during their efforts to reclaim Myth Drannor in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sharora had long black hair tied in a braid, and wore a suit of plate mail decorated in russet reds and browns.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1374 DR , Sharora joined the Elves of Cormanthor at the Myth Drannor outskirts camp as they worked to reclaim the city. When the lich Droic Orgul and his Red Wizards arrived and stole the Key to the Mythal , she offered her expertise in defeating Orgul, working with Tarathiel Miastina to investigate and dismantle the Red Wizards' plans. She used her knowledge of liches and phylacteries to plan a counter-attack that would permanently remove the foul creature, and when the moment came, she sent a team to the House of Gems where they defeated Saren'kek and absconded with the phylactery hidden there.</p>
