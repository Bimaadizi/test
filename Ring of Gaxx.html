<p>The ring of Gaxx was a powerful and particularly evil magic ring owned by the demilich Kangaxx .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>While it was rather plain in appearance, the ring did feature a faceted gem with nine different sides. It radiated pure evil energy that came from the terrible magic it held.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The ring of Gaxx offered many boons to its wearer. It protected them from mundane physical harm, offered them limited resistance to spells and magical effects, granted them a form of regeneration , and even rendered them immune to any form of poison or disease .</p>
<p>Using the ring's powers, its wearer could make themselves invisible for hours at a time , and greatly quicken their actions for a matter of seconds .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The ring was crafted by Kangaxx sometime during the era of ancient Netheril , thousands of years before the Era of Upheaval . It was believed that the power of the ring's gem was drawn from great death and loss.</p>
<p>It was interred with Kangaxx in his tomb, within a subterranean crypt in western Faer√ªn , atop which was built the city of Athkatla . The lich's body was sundered to pieces and scattered in various locations, watched over by the very Netherese liches that sought Kangaxx's destruction.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>While it was worth a significant sum in gold , most merchants were unwilling to deal with the vile item.</p>
