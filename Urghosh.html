<p>Urghosh was a type of sophisticated locking mechanism of great cunning created by the orc tribes of north Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Urghosh locks were of district make; for the unfamiliar, they simply looked peculiar, but rogues could identify the mechanism's origin. They would also know that urghosh locks were often laced with poisons such as carrion crawler brain juice , which causes paralysis, among others. Very few thieves and rogues could safely remove said mechanisms, apart from the expert orc rogues who installed them in the first place.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR , some of the chests that belonged to the orcish tribes that feuded for territory with other inhabitants of the ruins of Myth Drannor were locked and secured by the urghosh. The chests were notoriously hard, almost impossible to safely open for anyone but the owners.</p>
