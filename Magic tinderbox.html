<p>A magic tinderbox was a tinderbox enchanted for better reliability. It was invented by the Halruaan mage Daltim Flamefist .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A magic tinderbox resembled a perfectly ordinary tinderbox, being a set of typical tools for making a fire, including a piece of flint and steel and dry materials to burn. These were kept inside an engraved wooden box to keep them dry.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The tools of a magic tinderbox were used in the same way as those of a traditional tinderbox. The flint-and-steel was enchanted to always create sufficient sparks to ignite a fire. This worked in wind and rain, though extreme conditions such as a gale or torrential downpour were too great for proper functioning.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Halruaan mage Daltim Flamefist developed the magic tinderbox in the 1360s DR . His technique circulated in Faer√ªn , and magic tinderboxes came to be used by several well-equipped adventuring companies.</p>
<p>Daltim wrote details of the magic tinderbox and notes for creating one in his spellbook Daltim's Tome of Fire , which he lost in Tethyr in the 1360s DR .</p>
