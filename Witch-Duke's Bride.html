<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 14 th century DR , the establishment was known as the High Tankard that serves ales and cheeses exclusively. It was owned by the Brewers and Cheesemakers Guild , and its headquarters, The Caskhouse , was located above the tavern on the building's second floor.</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Nether Mountain Scrolls, 1486 DR , Witch-Duke's Bride was still considered a relatively new establishment, yet it was favored by the rich and noble of the city and travelers from afar alike. In the late 15 th century DR, the tavern's owner was Mastaal Gerahgen , an ex-ship captain and the owner of one of the largest selections of liquors in Suzail, imported from across the Sea of Fallen Stars .</p>
<p>Sometime circa 1486 DR, the Witch-Duke's Bride became a site of an argument between members of Marliir and Huntcrown noble families of Cormyr that resulted in a duel challenge.</p>
