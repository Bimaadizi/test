<p>Garmuth's Golden Gauntlet was an inn and festhall located in the town of Tulmon on the Lake of Steam in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The establishment derived its name from the large gauntleted hand that stood in the center of the main lobby.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The festhall was frequented mostly by Tulmon's working class, so brawls often broke out during the various dances. Patrons could use private suites to enjoy a more peaceful evening. Order and security was maintained by a staff of ex- adventurers .</p>
