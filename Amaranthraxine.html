<h2>History</h2>
<p>While traveling across Abeir with her friend Murbur, Amaranthraxine came across the abandoned city of Xorvintroth and discovered the inter-planar portals to the Far Realm within. They relocated themselves to the city to ensure no malevolent forced passed through to their world.</p>
<p>When the Spellplague struck the Realms in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , Xorvintroth along with several other cities shifted from the world of Abeir to its sister planet Toril . During the world-changing event, Amaranthraxine's spirit was infused into the walls of Xorvintroth, while her physical form eventually reappeared within the city at its new resting place.</p>
