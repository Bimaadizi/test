<p>A luck blade (or luckblade ) was a powerful magical sword that increased its wearer's luck by granting a number of benefits.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Any type of sword could be enchanted to become a luck blade . However, shortswords were more common in the pre- Spellplague period.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The wielder of a luck blade enjoyed a number of magical benefits. The blade itself was enchanted to improve its accuracy in combat and conferred an improved resistance to general detrimental effects and misfortunes, magical or otherwise.</p>
<p>Additionally, the blade granted its wielder with the power of good fortune, giving them the ability to turn one immediate bad turn of events into a good one, once per day. The sword regained this ability in the following dawn.</p>
<p>Finally, a luck blade was granted with up to three uses of the wish spell , each of which could also be cast only once a day. Once all the uses were expended, the sword could no longer provide new wishes , but all its other enhancements remained.</p>
