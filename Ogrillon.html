<p>Ogrillons ( pronounced : / oʊ ˈ g r ɪ l ʌ n z / o-GRIL-unz or : /ˈ ɑː g r ɪ l ʌ n z / AG-ril-unz ) were the result of orcs and ogres breeding.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ogrillons looked very similar to orcs. Roughly 10% of ogrillons inherited the physical attributes of their ogre parentage and were clearly distinguishable from other orcs.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Ogrillons lived in tribes. They often cooperated with orcs and were regularly used by orc groups as extra muscle.</p>
<p>Despite little use for currency , ogrillons often considered gold coins lucky and most ogrillons carried coins with them.</p>
<p>Although most ogrillons pursued barbarian or fighter roles, some chose to become shamans .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Ogrillons thrived in combat and were uncomfortable and restless if not in a battle.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Ogrillons were carnivorous.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of 1370 DR , ogrillons were one of the many creatures used as slaves in Menzoberranzan . At some point, the second house of Menzoberranzan ( House Barrison Del'Armgo ) owned roughly 250 slave ogrillons.</p>
