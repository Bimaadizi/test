<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He held a long standing suspicion against the halfling Regis .</p>
<p>Captain of Targos Guard Haldor was Kemp's right hand in the late 15 th century DR.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kemp led Targos through the Battle of Icewind Dale in the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR and the reconstruction efforts thereafter, through to at least 1364 DR .</p>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Kemp's rule came to a test when Targos began accepting refugees from the smaller settlements among the Ten Towns. Icewind Dale faced an existential threat from a strange blue-skinned shaman who served the godling son of Auril , Arctus , who was about to break out of its prison and lay waste to the Ten Towns. Faced with the refugee crisis, Kemp came to regular head-butting with the members of his council. Luckily, a recent arrival to Targos, the spymaster of Neverwinter , Aarin Gend , brought the famed Hero of Neverwinter to Targos's town hall. Together, they convinced Kemp to allow them to leave Targos, placed under a lockdown, and investigate Icewind Dale in hopes of stopping the threat to the region. Kemp also implored the Hero to find Wulfgar , a barbarian her of the Dale, who went missing after venturing into Termalaine , to confront its occupiers. When the word of war reached Kemp, he organized the defense of Targos against the army assembled by the blue-skinned shaman and the Walking Winter, Arctus himself. Kemp may have helped to secure the allyship of Bryn Shander with the Hero's help, and the Hero managed to convince allies in Icewind Dale to lend their swords and spells to the town's defense. Subsequently, Kemp survived the battle of Targos and secured more political capital for himself in the process.</p>
