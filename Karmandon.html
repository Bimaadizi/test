<p>Karmandon was a Netherese rogue and fashionista who owned Karmandon's Finery in Karsus Enclave until its destruction in 3520 NY (−339 DR) .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Karmandon was a skilled and relentless pathological liar. He was particularly adept at verbally backstabbing his own associates, then denying all wrongdoing through a combination of logical reasoning and rhetorical agility. Despite these efforts, he was still well-known as an prolific liar.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Karmandon sold fashionable clothing, sets of jewelry, and other accoutrements, but his shop started to shrink with the rise of Chanragoupta's Exotic . Unable to compete in the field of business, he turned to vicious rumor-mongering in the hopes of destroying his rival's reputation.</p>
