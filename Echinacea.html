<p>Echinacea was a type of flowering plant related to daisies with medicinal properties that could be found in the Icewind Dale region.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The blooms on these plants bore some resemblance to black-eyed susans , albeit when the latter flowers were in a frail, limp, and thin state.</p>
<h2>Usages</h2>
<p>These plants could be used to treat bacterial infections, cysts, boils, and conditions of the nose and sinuses, as well as to purify blood.</p>
<p>Among the giff , these plants were used as an ingredient in Herb Tea 33-Alpha .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the giff mercenary commander, Lieutenant Prook , escaped from the neogi deathspider Er'lir Fezrrega'l after it crash-landed in Icewind Dale , he carried written instructions detailing how to help him should he succumb to the elements. These instructions included what was referred to as "Emergency Protocol 33-Alpha", which called for the use of Herb Tea 33-Alpha, as most standard methods of restoration known on Toril wouldn't work on giff. A recipe for the tea was also included.</p>
<p>A group of adventurers helped Prook acquire the ingredients necessary for the herbal tea . For echinacea, they acquired some from a masked apothecary by the name of Butiki, who in actuality was a trio of Icewind kobolds in a heavy fur coatâ€” Bubu , Kiki , and Tirr .</p>
