<p>A lesser deity was a type of deity that was embodied in the planes.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In the 14 th century DR , they were ranked below an intermediate deity or a greater deity . They were, however, above demigods in the ranking of powers.</p>
<p>After the Second Sundering , they were ranked above a quasi-deity and below a greater deity .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>A lesser deity owned all abilities of a quasi-deity and a demigod including immortality.</p>
<p>A lesser deity was completely immune to any attempt to magically imprison or banish it.</p>
<p>Lesser deities could inherently cast plane shift as often as they wanted.</p>
<p>A lesser deity had even more power over its own realm. It could fill its own realm with intelligible sound and could control how the realm connected to the Astral Plane , effectively controlling how well teleportation worked on the realm.</p>
<p>Lesser deities could take on the form of average specimen of any creature.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>In the 14 th century DR , a lesser deity had thousands to tens of thousands of followers. This was a general rule of thumb. Another factor that determined a deity's status was the devoutness of the followers.</p>
<p>They were generally servants of stronger deities. Independent ones were generally outcasts. They were the object of worship of oppressed social groups or niche groups.</p>
