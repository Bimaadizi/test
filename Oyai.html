<p>Oyai was a Tabaxi human woman of Katashaka who led her people to Chult and became Negus Negusti (Prince of Princes) and First Bara of Ubtao in the early 3 rd millennium before Dale Reckoning .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At the time, the lands of the Tabaxi were reigned over by a nyama-nummo known as the Sleeper , who supposedly favored them over the other tribes of Katashaka. As a baby, Oyai was named Tarasajok , meaning "She Who Watches over the Sleeper"—and who had the honor of being first to be eaten by the tarrasque upon awakening at the Palace of the Alliz-Dren on the next Night of Feasting.</p>
<p>Shortly after, the couatl Ecatzin came to the Tabaxi to preach of the god Ubtao. Although initially resistant, fearing the feathered serpent to be a minion of Akongo , some of the tribe, including Oyai, gradually came to accept the couatl's words and to learn a little of its language. A chosen few like Oyai even learned a forbidden magic called matumbe . But they still dreaded the Sleeper's imminent awakening.</p>
<p>Finally, on the next Night of Feasting at the end of a millennium, Ubtao blessed Oyai, naming her Negus Negusti and Bara, right before the Sleeper awoke with a roar and came to devour her. But Oyai used the matumbe magic to halt, crush, and slay the Sleeper. That night, many liberated and joyous Tabaxi celebrated Oyai and pledged themselves to Ubtao, as Ecatzin named them Ubtao's blessed children.</p>
<p>Soon after, in −2809 DR , Oyai led the peoples of the Tabaxi, Eshowe , Thinguth , and several others who'd accepted the faith of Ubtao to go with the couatls in a great pilgrimage over the ocean in some 300 canoa (canoes). Landing on the Wild Coast, they journeyed into the Jungles of Chult and met their new god at the Peaks of Flame . Oyai ruled over the first Tabaxi of Chult, and her story of Katashaka would be recorded in the Teachings of Ubtao , later stored in the vaults of the Maze of Life in the later city of Mezro .</p>
