<p>Megaloceros was an ancient, dire species of deer whose existence persisted in some areas of the Realms.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These creatures were roughly the same size as a moose , with their bodies standing up to 7 ft (2.1 m) tall and being 10 feet (3 meters) in length. They had antlers that spread out to 10​ to ​12 feet (3​ to ​3.7 meters) in length and that weighed around 100 lb (45 kg).</p>
<p>The typical megaloceros had a fast gait.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>These creatures were typically non-aggressive, but could be dangerous to others in the early spring when mating season occurred. During that time males became extremely aggressive and territorial, while females around that same season became more defensive of their young.</p>
<p>When moving they often made very sudden shifts in the direction they were going, a manner of movement that some considered jarring.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<h3>Biological</h3>
<p>A megaloceros could carry and haul heavy loads. A small load for them was roughly up to 400 lb (180 kg), medium loads were in a range of 401‒800 lb (182‒360 kg), and heavy loads were in a range of 801‒1,200 lb (363‒540 kg). And though they could not carry, these creatures were capable of dragging over 6,000 lb (2,700 kg).</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>The megaloceros would charge at the most obvious and brightly colored threat, defending itself by goring opponents with its huge antlers. These creatures would also scoop up opponents with their antlers, toss them around, and try to trample them.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Though they could be found solitarily, a megaloceros was typically in a herd of six to twenty members.</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>The megaloceros was a herbivorous species.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>These creatures were typically found in temperate forests or cold climate marshes.</p>
<p>On Toril , they could be found in the moors and coniferous forests of the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Some races were known to use the megaloceros as a mount , such as by neanderthals , snow elves , and arctic druids . It took roughly four weeks at the least to train a megaloceros to be a mount. Midgard dwarves were known to use them as pack animals. And arctic druids sometimes had them as an animal companion .</p>
<p>Some neanderthals and snow goblins were known to revere the megaloceros as a totem animal, referring to it as the "Great Snow Elk."</p>
<p>In the wild they were often hunted by saber-toothed tigers .</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>Many creatures sought after their large antlered skulls as a decoration for their lairs, hunting lodges, or castles.</p>
