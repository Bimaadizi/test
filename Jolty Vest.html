<p>The Jolty Vest was an enchanted suit of chainmail created by the eccentric gnome inventor, Yrre the Sparkstruck .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Many of Yrre's inventions, whether they be armor or weapons, allowed individuals to build up an electrical charge within their body. If the wearer of the Jolty Best had built up this charge, they became more dangerous to any nearby foe. Anyone striking the wearer would be shocked with an electric blast.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the suit of armor remained in the possession of Brem , a Zhentarim merchant.</p>
