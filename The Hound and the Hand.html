<p>The Hound and the Hand was a book of the Tyrran faith printed sometime in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>The book retold the story of how the deity of law Tyr lost his hand to the primordial evil of Kezef the Chaos Hound. The story talked about how the gods stood united against Kezef, forcing him to the Barrens of Doom and Despair . They ended up offering the primordial a deal: if Kezef was able to break chains forged by Gond , using Cocytus metal, and reinforced by Mystra 's magic, then the hound would be left alone by the deities. Kezef agreed, but only if Tyr held his hand in the hound's mouth. Kezef knew that he would not be able to break free but if he were to be chained, he could take Tyr's hand. Since then, the Maimed God was one-handed.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a copy of The Hound and the Hand could be found in the library of the Stormshore Tabernacle in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate , stored near the altar and statue dedicated to Tyr.</p>
