<h2>Powers</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Many years before 1372 DR , a member of the Iron Order named Vilaneux was caught in a hurricane and ended up washed ashore in a faraway strange and then unexplored land of Kara-Tur . For the locals, Vilaneux's enchanted plate armor was an oddity and quickly became well recognized. Eventually, he gained fame and the love of the locals after serving justice and defending the weak. His renown was so great that after his death, his magic armor was flattened and cut into the first Shining Light shurikens as a tribute.</p>
<p>By 1372 DR , some of these enchanted exotic thrown weapons had reached the Sword Coast and the city of Neverwinter .</p>
