<p>Farloi was a bold tasloi fighter and one of the two lieutenants of the Flotilla of DEATH .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like other tasloi, Farloi had bright green skin and black eyes, but he lacked any hair. He was taller than his fellow tasloi, standing 3 ft 4 in (100 cm). He sported a muscular build and weighed around 65 lb (29 kg).</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Farloi was quite a bold individual. He often sought to prove his bravery and valor by undertaking unusual risks. However, he was also quite harsh overseer of his fellow crewmen, always insisting they act more civilized and pushing them to act bravely like him. He took particular umbrage from his fellow tasloi dragging their knuckles on the ground when they walked.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Farloi typically dressed himself in a white sailor's uniform adorned with three copper medals that no particular worth or significance. Like the other tasloi on the Flotilla of DEATH , he was typically armed with a javelin , though he also wielded a dagger . Notable among his possessions was a ring of jumping , which he would use to jump from the back of giant gooney birds and onto his opponents.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Farloi was born sometime around the Year of the Bright Blade, 1347 DR , on the island of Tasloiomitasloi , as the third cousin of the island's high chieftain. Sometime later Spitvah Mc Gurk discovered the island and struck up a bargain with the native tasloi to form a small seafaring fleet called the Flotilla of DEATH , wherein Farloi would be promoted to the role of lieutenant alongside Gisloi . Farloi in particular enlisted most of his clansmen, as he desired to prove their combat prowess.</p>
