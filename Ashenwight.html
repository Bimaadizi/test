<p>An ashenwight was a form of undead that arose from the bodies of humanoids who had died in areas corrupted by the Far Realm whilst consumed by feelings of cruelty and rage. If specifically arisen near a crystal vein infused with aberrant energies, or if one lingered in an area of fell magic , the ashenwight could potentially develop psionic abilities.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These undead had corporeal bodies, with desiccated skin and glowing eyes.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Most had feral minds, retaining a only fragment of their former selves that was devoid of memories or thoughts. Such ashenwights were consumed by a compulsive desire to destroy any living creature they encountered.</p>
<p>Psionic ashenwights had exhibited exceptionally far greater sapience than the standard variety, though whatever consciousness they possessed was something wholly new and unrelated to whoever they were in life.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Ashenwights typically fought by producing shards imbued with necrotic energy .</p>
<p>In addition to being able to produce more potent shards, psionic ashenwights could produce psionic effects similar to calm emotions and mage hand (without a visible hand). They could communicate telepathically. And they had the ability to manifest a subduing crown of jagged, spectral crystals around the head of a nearby creature, making them sluggish and attacking their psyche.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>While feral minded ashenwights lacked the sentience to seek anything more than destruction, the psionic variety were typically dedicated to either uncovering their past self or enlightening other ashenwights to their psionic potential.</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>Ashenwights knew the same languages that their body had spoken in life, though were unable to speak. Those psionically gifted were able to get around this with their telepathy.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Centuries prior to Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR , mind flayers wrested control of Zorzula's Rest , an ancient duergar mining outpost beneath the Sword Mountains . During their takeover the illithids trapped the soul of Zorzula's last mining captain, Hjoldak Hollowhelm , within a canopic jar sealed shut by an intricate puzzle lock.</p>
<p>In 1491 DR, a group of adventurers traveling in the depths of Zorzula's Rest to uncover an illithid plot encountered several feral and psionic ashenwights that had arisen from the bodies of the outpost's former duergar denizens. They later came across Hjoldak's canopic jar in the private quarters of Ruxithid the Chosen . Through some means or another managed to free Hjoldak's soul from the jar, manifesting a psionic ashenwight that somehow retained Hjoldak's memories of the outpost's layout and hidden rooms. Eager to compensate his rescuers, the ashenwight offered to act as their guide through Zorzula's Rest. Later at the Underdark crossroads known as Gibbet's Crossing , in one had once been a duergar workshop, the adventurers encountered four more feral ashenwights.</p>
<p>Months prior, a pair of duergar mages that were disciples of Ilvaash brought four duergar warriors to the Brinzy Maze , the godlet's domain within the Far Realm, with the intention of sacrificing them. However, a fight broke out an all involved died. The two mages would arise from the dead as psionic ashenwights and go on to ally with a pair of phase spiders for mutual protection. These ashenwights would later be encountered and fought by the adventurers of Phandalin . The pair were crossed with Ilvaash, feeling it had betrayed them, but were unwilling to help the adventurers in working against it.</p>
