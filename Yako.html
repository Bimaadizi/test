<p>Yako was shu cook member of the Simbuki tribe of the Living Jungle , later known as the Tribe of Big Chief Bagoomba , in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Great Change, or the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , the Simbuki tribe hosted the annual Festival of Chief Booda celebrating Bagoomba becoming the tribe's Chief, in which many friendly competitions took place. Yako ran the eating contest that had no prize apart from bragging rights. Yako's own signature mango-honeydew-ant pies were the object of the competition. Each contestant was to announce the number of pies they were intended to eat, and the winner was to finish the entire set and beat the previous year's champion â€“ Shimok , who was famous for his eating in the village. Many members of the tribe and visitors from neighboring communities placed bets on who would emerge victorious in the eating competition.</p>
