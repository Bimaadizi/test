<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Year of the Spur, 1348 DR saw the formation of the adventuring company that gained renown in Cormyr â€“ the Knights of Myth Drannor , but the same year birthed several less known organizations, including the Company of the Cleaver. Possibly the most fame the Company of the Cleaver ever saw came with the group's successful delve into the depths of Undermountain , the grand dungeon underneath the City of Splendor, Waterdeep . The adventure concluded with the members of the group riding a giant silvery snail along the streets of Waterdeep's Castle Ward .</p>
