<p>Grease mephits were a rare variety of elemental mephits that could be summoned to the Prime Material plane by some mages alongside greaseballs and grease elementals .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like other elementals, grease mephits were creatures composed of grease. They resembled mud mephits â€“ tiny and ugly humanoid-shaped creatures with wings, covered in oozing, slick, oily grease. They possessed low intelligence but were sentient creatures.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As elemental creatures of grease, they were vulnerable to fire but completely immune to poison . In battle, grease mephits flittered about the battlefield and flung handfuls of grease at the enemies. They could also discharge a burst that covered the cone-shaped area in front of them in slippery grease . A grease maphit could summon more grease mephits to its aid, and upon death, they exploded in a damaging, forceful burst of grease.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Grease mephits had an affinity for filth, sewage, and rotting food. When they died, a mage could return them to life as magma mephits via the invigorating flame spell .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the mad sewer-dwelling grease-mage named Aelis Siryasius inhabited the sewers of Baldur's Gate . His small patch of sewers was infested with a small army of grease mephits, grease elementals, and greaseballs.</p>
