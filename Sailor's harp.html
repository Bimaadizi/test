<p>Sailor's harps were old decaying harps that were enchanted to become a debilitating magical weapon.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Sailor's harps were so old they crumbled after a single-use. However, that was by design. These decaying musical instruments were enchanted to unleash a deafening burst of cacophonous raucous when in the hands of a bard. After that, sailor's harps fell apart and turned into dust.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These harps were popular among sailors and pirates who had musical or bardic inclinations. By the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , sailor's harps could be found in the hands and sold by sailors visiting Neverwinter and pirates of the Nelanther Islands .</p>
