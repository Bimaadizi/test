<p>Pluton , also called Olympian's Gloom , was the third layer, also called third gloom, of Hades in the Great Wheel cosmology and an astral dominion in the World Axis cosmology .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Pluton was not as cold as Niflheim but still a cool place. However, its vegetation was that of a subtropical place, with willows , olive trees , and poplars . These trees were in the state of dying for an unknown but very long time. It was believed that these trees had petitioners inside them and druids could feel the trees' sadness.</p>
<p>The Blood War was not waged in Pluton but sometimes fiends came to get the soul of a particularly skilled person.</p>
<h2>Cosmography</h2>
<p>The base of Mount Olympus was located in Pluton, close to the entrance to the realm of Hades . Since it avoided the upper layers of Oinos and Niflheim, it was frequently used by travelers, despite being a dangerous and treacherous route.</p>

<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>One of the legends about the origins of the Raven Queen stipulated that she was originally a sorceress who led a rebellion against a god of death who held domain in Pluton. Other deities recognized her as one of their own, but, in order to prevent her from becoming a tyrant much like the defeated deity, granted her domain over death but not the dead themselves.</p>
