<p>High Lama Torgoja P'a was a human monk and lama of the Path of Enlightenment dwelling on Mount Or-Ghash in the Chigidi Mountains on the Plain of Horses circa Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>P'a's early life was little known. He first appeared in the Plain of Horses around Shou Year 2592 (1342 DR) , seeming to be nothing more than a nomad with two black camels who arrived at Alamaqu , a city of the T'aghur tribe. But only days later he had persuaded local rebel leaders to give up their plan to depose the tribe's ruling triumvirate.</p>
<p>He went west and stopped in Peqqir , where he aided in the design of an irrigation project that would bring water to mulberry farms on mountain slopes. The grateful Guychiang tribe offered to construct a temple in his honor, but P'a refused and continued on his way.</p>
<p>After a while, around Shou Year 2597 (1347 DR) , P'a made his home on Mount Or-Ghash and became the high lama there.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Although he preferred the company of his two camels to that of his fellow lamas, P'a was known to be amiable and nice. He had a reputation for wisdom and a noble spirit.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Many people, from farmers to nobles, came to ask P'a for his counsel and he welcomed all of them.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was plump of body, with bushy eyebrows and a short brown beard. His youthful appearance belied his age—he looked to be only around 30 years old around, despite his past—and he would never say how old he really was.</p>
<p>He wore a red robe that was old, tattered, and had numerous repairs.</p>
