<p>Rilauven was a relatively small and young drow city in the Underdark in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The city was located under an area near the surface city of Neverwinter , likely in the Northdark . [ speculation ] It was close to the illithid compound of Z'hinda Citadel , which once belonged to the drow.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Rilauven's Lolthite priesthood was overthrown by the worshipers of Vhaeraun in a relatively bloodless coup. The city was thereafter ruled by a council of the representatives of its Sorcere, Belaessar, Melee-Quartha, and Ultrinnan Qu'ellar, respectively, the academies of wizards , merchants , warriors , and old noble Houses. These houses included:</p>
<p>All drow members of its society, be they wizard, fighter, or cleric, were apparently treated the same, although the city's Archmage , Malavon Despana , who organized the coup, seemed to hold the most power and Vhaeraun was venerated above Lolth .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>It was rumored that the Legion of the Chimera would attack Rilauven, and the Melee-Quartha were busy preparing battle defenses.</p>
<p>Apparently, the priests of Vhaeraun railed against civic battles. The Sorcere hoped that Menzoberranzan never decided to wipe them out.</p>
