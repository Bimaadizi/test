<p>Rodolpho Wianar was a nobleman and a cousin of Eles Wianar , the Lord of Arrabar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Flamerule of the Year of the Helm, 1362 DR , Rodolpho attended his cousin's lush annual festival - the Night of Ghosts . At some point during the celebration, the man snuck away into the palace gardens of Generon to have a romantic rendezvous with a lady. At the same time, three young scions of Arrabar's noble houses, Adyan Mercatio , Horial Rohden , and Vambran Matrell , were playing around with Vambran's bejeweled crossbow , shooting at plantain fruits. One stay bolt missed the tree and embedded itself in Rodolpho's chest, killing him. Eventually, the nobleman's body was discovered by the man's paramour and friends, who were confronted by a masked assassin. The assassin shot at the guests and fled, pursued by the Municipal Guard of Arrabar . The assassin's identity was not discovered - Xaphira Matrell , beloved aunt of Vambran Matrell. Xaphira was a mercenary commander and decided to take the fall, saving her family and her nephew. She fled the city, leaving the Lord of Arrabar to start a headhunt for the murderer of his family member.</p>
<p>Eleven years later, Xaphira Matrell returned to Arrabar to aid her family against a plot that was sure to ruin the family. She shared some vital information regarding Rodolpho Wianar's death in the process. Vamran's stray bolt did not kill him. Someone stole several bolts from the young man's quiver and framed him. That became evident when Xaphira Matrell fled the guard. She was shot in the leg with the identical bolt that was retrieved from the dead nobleman. Rodolpho's death was part of a bigger plan orchestrated by those who sought to plunge Arrabar into war.</p>
