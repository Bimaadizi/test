<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The village of Snowmantle in Daggerdale was known for its production and sale of mushroom wine, which was fermented in a facility on the south side of town. It was made from special mushrooms that grew only in the Border Forest around Snowmantle, notably to the town's west, north, and east.</p>

<p>The drow inhabitants of Svartalfheim in the Nidavellir layer of Ysgard were known for producing an excellent mushroom wine.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the aptly named Year of Many Mushrooms, 238 DR , persistent damp weather and widespread disease across north Faerûn created the ideal conditions for widespread and supernatural mushroom growth, which led to a short-term fad for mushroom food products including mushroom wine.</p>
<p>After the Zhentarim occupied the town of Snowmantle in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, they identified mushroom wine as a potentially valuable trade good. As of the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , this had led them to preserve the parts of the Border Forest where the necessary mushrooms grew and to spare the life of the last living person who knew the secret of its production, Willard Gooseford .</p>
