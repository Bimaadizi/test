<h2>History</h2>
<p>While Gondegal seems to have acquired the weapon in Faer√ªn , some time before or during his uprising in Cormyr in the Year of the Dragon, 1352 DR , its true worth became apparent when the Mists spirited him into the realm of Ravenloft, aiding him in battling the were-creatures, vampires , and other such monsters there. As a Knight of the Shadows, it aided him greatly in combatting evil and dispensing final justice.</p>
