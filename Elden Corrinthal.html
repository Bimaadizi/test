<h3>Childhood</h3>

<p>However, in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , during the Sembian Civil War some troops sent by Malkur Forrin attacked the estate, killing all inside beside Elden. On Nightal 1 , at Abelar's request, Erevis Cale and Drasek Riven infiltrated Forrin's camp and Cale healed Elden and took him to safety.</p>
<h3>The Oracle</h3>
<p>In the Year of the Awakened Sleepers, 1484 DR , Elden, now the Oracle, encouraged Vasen Cale to follow the destiny that Amaunator would show him.</p>
<p>As dictated by a dream sent by his father, the Oracle released the spirits of Elgrin Fau that had kept safe the Abbey for so many years. Later, Sayeed and Zeeahd invaded the Abbey with their pack of spined devils . The Oracle was confronted by Zeeahd. Elden managed to humiliate Zeehad and so he ordered his spined devils to kill Elden. The Oracle was well prepared for his death and died with a smile.</p>
