<p>The Swamphouse Inn was an inn and tavern located in Moortown , Vaasa . As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , it was one of the only intact buildings in the ruined town.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The inn was located on the southern side of town not far from the temple of Tempus and the stables.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The inn's footprint was 80 feet (24 meters) by 60 feet (18 meters). It was a two-story brick building with a faded sign and a chimney rising from the northeast corner. A porch on the western side of the inn led up to the front door.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The front door opened into the ground floor, which was dominated by an unremarkable dining room and bar. There was a separate kitchen in the northeast corner with a large fireplace, and a backdoor provided an exit from this kitchen to the east side of the inn.</p>
<p>Stairs on the north side of the dining room led up to the second floor, which had seven bedrooms along a single 10‑foot (3‑meter) wide hallway. Four of these rooms were smaller—approximately 400 square feet (37 square meters) each—and sat along the eastern side of the hall. These rooms had bare floors, simple beds, and some small furnishings. The remaining three rooms on the western side were larger—between 600 square feet (56 square meters) and 900 square feet (84 square meters).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As the Swamphouse Inn was still mostly intact after Moortown was abandoned in the 14 th century DR, it was claimed as a headquarters by a garrison from the Cult of the Dragon led by Marlaxit-Tharg . The cultists used the rooms as a barracks and the bar for storage, as well as to hide the possessions of their captives while they indoctrinated them. Soon, the cultists had broken down all of the Inn's furniture into firewood.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , the Cult captured a woman named Sarahla during a raid, and forced her to be their cook. In Flamerule of the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , much of the Moortown garrison emptied out to travel to a meeting with the Zhentarim in the Moonsea region, leaving only Marlaxit, Sarahla, and the front door guard— Argrath —at the Inn.</p>
