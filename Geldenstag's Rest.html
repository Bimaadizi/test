<p>Geldenstag's Rest was one of the oldest inns in Bryn Shander .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The inn was located close to Bryn Shander's East Gate.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The proprietor, Myrtle , was known to constantly ask her customers about what they were up to each day.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The inn's accommodations were lackluster, with small rooms and minimal, dirty, furnishing. However, due to Myrtle's constant questioning, people who had something to hide often avoided the inn. For that reason, the place was popular among travelers who wished to avoid too much excitement.</p>
