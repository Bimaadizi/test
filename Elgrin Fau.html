<p>Elgrin Fau was a human city on another forgotten world and later sent to the Shadow Deep , in the Plane of Shadow by Kesson Rel .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>More than 6000 years before the 14 th century DR , Kesson Rel was exiled from Elgrin Fau and took revenge by banishing the entire city (including the wall) to the Plane of Shadow, using the power he had gained as the first Chosen of Mask .</p>
<p>The people managed to survive for some time. They began to bury their dead inside the city walls and constructed a necropolis in the middle of the city to house and keep them in their graves. But eventually the survivors abandoned the city and left for other planes.</p>
<p>When the city was empty, Kesson Rel returned and opened a gate in the middle of the necropolis to taunt the dead interred there. He set a guard over the gate, a darkweaver .</p>
