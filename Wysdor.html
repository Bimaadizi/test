<p>Wysdor was the gnomish captain of the dreadnaught Unquenchable .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Wysdor's brother was named Horvath and served as navigator aboard his ship.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Decades before 1361 DR , a group of Tinker gnomes set out from Krynn to explore the reaches of wildspace . In another crystal sphere , they had encountered neogi and were so distraught from the encounter that they returned to their own sphere and planet. Their vessel crash landed on Krynn, leaving only a small number of survivors. These survivors included Wysdor and his brother Horvath. These gnomes oversaw the design and construction of a second spelljammer to replace the one that they had lost. This ship was the Unquenchable .</p>
<p>In 1361, Wysdor took on three gnomish admirals and a young human named Teldin Moore . The plan was to sail through wildspace to a planet called Devin, but before setting off from orbit around Krynn, Wysdor ordered his brother to lead a small team to examine the exterior of the sidewheeler for damage from an earlier battle. Teldin accompanied the four gnomes on this short excursion.</p>
<p>However, the sidewheeler was separated from its longboat when pirates unexpectedly attacked, and the fate of Wysdor and his dreadnaught are unknown.</p>
