<p>Gorstal Hammers was an adventuring wizard who lived in Telpir on the Dragon Coast , circa 1360 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Gorstal was a womanizer that had a taste for ladies in the upper echelons of society.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Hammers was a business partner with Endreth Molipher , a former pirate , and two other wizards, Halartan Groune , and Orbel Mhaerouzan .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Gorstal found a new use for creatures that he encountered while adventuring—he subdued and captured them instead of killing them, and delivered them to Molipher's island of Storna (not far from Telpir) in the Inner Sea for fun and profit. He and his fellow wizards helped make Molipher's Dark Dragon Hunts a success by providing the dangerous creatures that would be hunted, and by altering the dreams of hapless clients that failed to bag a monster so that they felt as if they had actually engaged in heroic battle with a deadly wild animal and triumphed.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>As part of the agreement, Gorstal was allowed to use the island as place to store items he wanted protected, or as a hideout.</p>
