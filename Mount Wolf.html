<p>Mount Wolf was a mountain in the Vast in north Faer√ªn . It lay within the Giantspike Mountains , a part of the Earthspur Mountains , and towered over the North Road south of Maskyr's Eye . It marked the proper border of the lands of the Vast and was a prominent local landmark to both the human and dwarf inhabitants of the land.</p>
