<h2>History</h2>
<p>Aldluck Dreen was at the revel in Warmfires House during the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR in which Maervidal Iloster was to be killed. He taunted the scribe about the saisha venom slipped into his drink. Calivar Murpeth, his boss, sent him to collect Brezter and the others for that. Aldluck returned later with a number of men, one of whom was also poisoned, around the time Calivar had captured a woman by the name of Talantha he suspected of aiding Maervidal's escape from the revel.</p>
<p>The woman was actually a spell-disguised Storm Silverhand , who defeated everyone in the room. Everyone left over was captured or killed by other agents among the staff of Warmfires.</p>
