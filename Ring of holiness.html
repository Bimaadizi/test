<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Church of Helm held a belief that the rings of holiness were created out of a supremely powerful magical ring that was gifted to Helm by Ao for the god's faithful service during the Time of Troubles. Helm diluted the artifact's power and split it into the rings of holiness to pass the gift upon his followers in the Realms.</p>
<p>Non-Helmite sages and scholars doubted that origin story, as, in their eyes, Ao was above such mundane human emotion as gratitude. Because of that, the Helmite story was considered nothing but propaganda.</p>
