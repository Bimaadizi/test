<p>Tia Harriman was an ambassador sent by King Azoun Obarskyr IV of Cormyr to the city-state of Innarlith on the Lake of Steam in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was stout and heavy.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>She was appointed as ambassador of Corymyr to Innarlith in 1365 DR . Cormyr previously didn't have an embassy in Innarlith, but after Innarlith began a project to construct a canal from the Lake of Steam to the Nagaflow , which would have thus connected the Sea of Fallen Stars to the oceans of Toril , Cormyr took an interest and decided to establish an embassy.</p>
<p>She attended Ransar Salatis 's New Year's Masque during the last evening of 1365 DR, dressed in an eagle costume, and met a number of the elite members of Innarlan society. She expressed Cormyr's hopes for the canal's completion but was surprised when she heard from some senators allied with the clandestine Red Wizard Marek Rymüt that the work would not be completed and that it was a fool's errand.</p>
