<p>Lake Weng (originally called the Lake of Amin ) was a lake in the Cloud Peaks region of Amn .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Lake Weng was a freshwater lake that formed between the foothills of the Cloud Peaks and a rocky ridge stretching from near the city of Crimmor to the city of Amnwater , sitting at an altitude of 1,500 feet (460 meters). It was fed by the Amnurflow and Wengwater and emptied by the Alandor River .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The lake was surrounded by more than half a dozen tiny villages, most notable of which were Minsor Vale , Ideepton , Edive , and Shatar . The people living along the water survived by fishing in the lake and growing root crops, taking few visitors and supplying food to the upcountry Citadel Amnur and Citadel Rashturl . A small amount of barge traffic reached up the river from Athkatla and Crimmor .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The lands around the lake were long part of the vast Calim Empire , but only became densely populated in the centuries following 100 DR during which Athkatla , Crimmor , and Murann were founded.</p>
<p>In 300 DR , the churches of Lathander , Mystra , Selûne , and Shar founded towns along the shores of the lake and became the united theocracy of Minsorran .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Sage's Fervor, 347 DR , the emperor Shoon VII gave governorship of the region around the Lake of Amin to Thealnak of Memnon as a reward for creating the Codex Thealnakkar .</p>
<p>The four settlements of Minsorran were destroyed in Year of Fire and Frost, 600 DR , when a harsh midwinter blizzard buried them in snow for months and all the citizens were eaten by the cunning white dragon Icehauptannarthanyx , who escaped detection. Minsor Vale, the Selûnite city, was eventually resettled centuries later and became a small village.</p>
