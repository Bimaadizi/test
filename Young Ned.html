<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first owner of the well-known lucky charm from Targos was Young Ned, circa 1292 DR . Young Ned often fished with his buddy, Thom Farold , who built a large boat he named Selara after his late wife. One day, Ned found his boat capsized in the cold waters of Maer Dualdon, but he managed to hold on to an "unbelievably massive" knucklehead —his prized catch of the day. When Ned got to the shore, though, he was rushed by a hungry bear who got away with most of the fish , leaving the youth unharmed, holding on to the knucklehead's head. Ned returned to Targos and kept the head as proof of his misadventure and lucky survival. Eventually, Young Ned started to believe that his Lucky Knucky indeed possessed luck-granting powers. Sometime later, Ned lost the lucky item in a rigged card game against Marg the Trembler . The brigand fled Targos soon after while Young Ned couldn't muster the courage to stand up to Marg.</p>
