<p>Thok Lian was the leading member of the Thok clan and the monarch of Laothan in Malatra in the midâ€“14 th century DR . He reined from the city of Cheinang .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Lian focused on diplomacy and was prone to speech more than to action. He could make very inspiring speeches but always dithered when the time for decision and action arrived. He was totally oblivious in military matters, instead depending on the princes who served him for both advice and to command the regional armies.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Thus, he and the Thok clan, who hoped for a more centralized state, needed their loyalty, but Lian's indecisiveness alienated him a third of the Thok clan's supporters. Prince Kung Bien of Kwang Tre was among those who remained loyal, while Prince Nuyen Phi of Sayan had grown deaf to his edicts and even rebellious. Against these internal disputes and separatist elements, Lian had a hard time trying to maintain his clan's heritage as heirs to the throne of Laothan and to keep the whole Seng people unified.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He was aged 41 around 1357 DR .</p>
