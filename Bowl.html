<p>Bowls were a common piece of crockery found everywhere in Faer√ªn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bowls were a fundamental part of kitchens and dining rooms for preparing and serving meals (often with a spoon ), especially those like soups , stews , and porridge , and a standard part of the mess kit used by travelers. Cheap, common bowls were made from wood, but finer crockery was made of ceramics such as porcelain , often with decorative glazing that made them into works of art.</p>
<p>Mortars were special bowls used for grinding materials into powder, while braziers were essentially large metal bowls used for holding burning fuel.</p>
