<p>A matron mother , in matriarchal drow society, was the leader of a House. She was generally a cleric of Lolth and was often a high priestess.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Matron mothers often thrived at the center of complex schemes of conspiracy and treachery, aiming both to further their own family's goals and the will of Lolth.</p>
<p>Some matron mothers chose to go against the teachings of Lolth, as they instead fought against her and her worshippers.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>At the peak of her power, a matron mother had access to extremely powerful clerical magic. It is common for matron mothers to wield tentacle rods that could slow down their opponents, as well as fear-inflicting demon staves . Additionally, they could summon yochlols to aid them in combat or to perform other tasks.</p>
<p>Their palace, usually marked with sigils, alongside any temple to Lolth, enabled a matron mother to access more power. They could telekinetically throw foes or restrain them with a spectral spider web.</p>
<p>A matron mother that rebelled against Lolth lost some of their powers, yet still remained a fearsome opponent.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Matron mothers commanded a vast network of demons , other drow, slaves, and all manner of spiders to keep their enemies in check. Their powers, however, were fickle, as Lolth could capriciously remove her favor as abruptly as she bestowed it. They were usually seen with a drow house captain and drow favored consort , alongside others that helped to assist and protect her.</p>
<p>Some of the matron mothers that were against Lolth held high positions in the Underdark armies that fought against her.</p>
