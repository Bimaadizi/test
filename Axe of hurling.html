<p>They were met by the spirit of the fountain, which told them that the spirit of Dorn Black Axe had awoken, and requested an audience with them.</p>
<p>Dorn retold his story of battling with the drow alongside kin in the Cavern of Cloven Heads . His clan were forced from their home, and he was slain in battle.
