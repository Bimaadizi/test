<p>The bardiche was a member of the poleaxe family of polearms .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The bardiche was similar in design to the average battleaxe , but elongated. They were rather broad and heavy, with shafts measuring 5​ to ​8 feet (1.5​ to ​2.4 meters) in length and large, narrow, curved axeheads measuring 24​ to ​32 inches (0.61​ to ​0.81 meters) in length or 2‒3 ft (0.61‒0.91 m). This axehead was mounted to its shaft by means of two metal rings, the lower of which improved the axehead's strength and protected the bardiche's most exposed area from attacks.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>Bardiches were rather cumbersome and unwiedly, more so than a halberd , requiring more room to wield than a pike or spear .</p>
<p>The upper half of the bardiche's axehead could be utilized for thrusting.</p>
