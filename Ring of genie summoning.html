<p>A ring of genie summoning was a magical ring that could be found in Zakhara , the Land of Fate. It was an expanded variant of the more common Faer√ªnean ring of djinni summoning .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This magical ring was able to summon a particular genie from its elemental plane when the item was rubbed. Each ring summoned a djinni , dao , efreeti , marid , or a more powerful noble genie variant. A summoned genie served the owner of the ring loyally until the genie was slain. The ring would become an ordinary piece of jewelry upon the genie's death. Summoned noble genies left their master's service after granting three wishes .</p>
<p>If a sha'ir was powerful enough, they could free regular genies from the ring and were sometimes granted a wish , with the freed genie's elders' blessing, that was free from any obligation.</p>
