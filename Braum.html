<p>Doctor Braum was a medical doctor of the town of Ghars in Cormyr in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Doctor Braum treated the people of Ghars; his skills were adequate, but not great. For a second opinion, people went to the retired War Wizard Benelaius behind Braum's back; Benelaius thought Braum to be a good man and didn't want to offend him by letting this be known. One difficult patient was Mayor Tobald . Braum found nothing wrong with him save his gout and advised him to eat less. Naturally, Tobald thought this absurd and claimed Braum "couldn't cure a nosebleed with a wagon load of cotton". He was even less impressed with the snake dung salve Braum prescribed.</p>
<p>Braum made house calls.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the beheaded body of blacksmith's assistant Dovo was found dead on the morning of Eleint 17 , the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , Doctor Braum was among those summoned to the crime scene. Although shocked by the grisly sight, Braum maintained his professionalism and was the first to identify the broken glass as coming from a lantern . Braum examined the body and estimated the time of death as 10–12 hours prior, which tallied with Jasper 's witness account, and tried to ascertain how the killing blow was made (but turned out to be mistaken).</p>
