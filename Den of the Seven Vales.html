<p>The Den of the Seven Vales was a tavern , frequented by peasants in the Guards District of Athkatla . Owing to the tendency of the original owner, Richard , to hire belly dancers, it was originally called the Den of the Seven Veils , due to the veils worn by such dancers. After he passed away, his wife, Patricia , fired the dancers and renamed the tavern to The Seven Vales .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The front bar-room contained a small service table, as well as many other tables and chairs. The back room was unmanned, but was filled with food and bottles of wine . It was fairly well lit for the societal class it appealed to. The upper floor contained a medium-sized room, containing a few beds and storage chests. Adventuring groups often preferred to stay on this floor.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The den offered a small, and cheap, selection of brews, including Bitter Black ale , Golden Sands Brews , Dragon's Breath Beer , and plain old mead . The main bar was manned by the misandrist bartender, Patricia. She would often refuse to talk to male patrons, and would not give up much information to them. However, she would serve them and put them up for the night.</p>
