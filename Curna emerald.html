<p>Curna emeralds were rare gemstones found in the Shining Lands .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These beautiful clear emeralds held turquoise light in their center. They were so named not only because they could be found only within the Curna Mountains , but also because the Gemstone chaka —who first discovered the emeralds—were devout worshipers of Curna .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The gemstones were rare and prized as of 1367 DR . By the late 15 th century DR , the emeralds were only found in secret mines controlled by the Gemstone chaka. It had begun to be rumored that the emeralds' glow was the result of traces of plangent crystal within them, and whatever the truth, it was said that the chaka had learned the secret of the emeralds from sources in the Library of Ormpé .</p>
