<p>Whelgar Taerncole was a human man of the city of Wheloon in Cormyr . He was a former adventurer and proprietor of the Sleeping Cat restaurant.</p>
<p>Whelgar was once an adventurer and a member of the Easy Blades Adventuring Band , a group often suspected of smuggling. He later retired.</p>
<p>Before 1358 DR , he bought the Sleeping Cat tavern in Wheloon. Sick of the brawling, Whelgar got rid of both taproom and wine cellar, and developed the place as a restaurant instead. By around 1369 DR , the Sleeping Cat had steadily become a proper, quality restaurant under Whelgar's ownership.</p>
