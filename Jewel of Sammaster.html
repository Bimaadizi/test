<p>The Jewel of Sammaster was a unique enchanted amulet that harnessed the power of an ancient dracolich .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The wearer of the Jewel was granted a powerful ability to call on the dormant powers of an unnamed ancient dracolich to discharge a cone of undead dragon 's breath upon their enemies.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Much of the item's history remained unrevealed. However, one thing was known. In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the Jewel of Sammaster , along with several other enchanted trinkets, fell into the hands of Plinshree , a naiad that guarded decaying waterways of Myth Drannor. She begged the heroes who opposed the Cult of the Dragon to repair the city's ancient water bells. When they succeeded, Plinshree thanked the adventurers with gifts of long-lost magic items that were swept away by Myth Drannor's fountains. The naiad had one more special gift for the Veiled Ones , but she would've only given it up if the heroes succeeded in slaying the dreaded dracolich Pelendralaar . That last gift was the Jewel of Sammaster .</p>
