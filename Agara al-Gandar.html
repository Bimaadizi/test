<p>Caliph Agara al-Gandar , who was also called Agara the Dandy was the ruler of the Free City of Utaqa in north Zakhara in 1367Â DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Agara was selected to be a puppet ruler by the mamluks of Qudra after an insurrection that resulted in the mamluks' execution of the previous Caliph and his entire family. Agara quickly realized that the population of Utaqa needed a degree of autonomy in order for anything to be accomplished. Though Qudra was carefully watching Agara's progress, they did not interfere since the Grand Caliph in Huzuz assured them that things were operating smoothly in the city under the new Caliphate. Agara was stressed more and more with the pressures of ruling such a city.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Agara was a successful businessman before becoming Caliph.</p>
