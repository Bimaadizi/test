<p>The Grail of Shargrailar was an enchanted drinking horn made from one of the horns of Shargrailar , the first and most powerful dracolich .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Carved from one of the horns of the slain undead red dragon , it was hollowed out and polished, then lined with platinum and encrusted with small jewels .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Though it was but an ordinary drinking vessel, the horn had lingering psychic auras of evil and necromantic magic .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After Shandril Shessair , Narm Tamaraith , and Delg Ironstar destroyed Shargrailar on Flamerule 9 in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , on the East Way near Thunder Gap , the dragon's horn was seized as a trophy and fashioned into a drinking vessel.</p>
<p>In the early 1370s DR, Winn Kardzen , the leader of the Cult of the Dragon 's Glarondan cell , was on the verge of convincing the fang dragon Nartheling to accept transformation into a dracolich . However, to seal the deal, he needed a phylactery worthy of the dragon 's essence and so sought out a relic of the right fame and nature. He more than succeeded, locating the Grail of Shargrailar .</p>
<p>After his agents obtained the Grail and shipped it to Velprintalar in Aglarond , circa 1372 DR , Winn hired the merchant Tulin Farweather to transport it to Glarondar , so as not to attract unwanted attention. However, it was lost en route â€”unknown to all, when the caravan carrying the horn made camp near a stone circle in the Yuirwood , the undead star elf Mourel Duskwalker emerged from a nearby portal to the Night Realm , stole the Grail , and retreated with it back to his demiplane . He had hopes of performing a ritual to tap into its innate power. Mourel stored it in one of the burial niches in his vault.</p>
<p>Afterward, not knowing what had happened, Tulin would try to hire adventurers to find the lost horn, offering a reward of 2,000 gp . Kardzen and the Cult would also try to search for and recover the lost horn, but the Grail 's fate is unknown.</p>
