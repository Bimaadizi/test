<p>Baunilorotha was the provisional capital of Kultaakarr as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It was located on the northern shore of the Sea of Frozen Tears , just south of the Surykyk Range . The long road known as the Reach passed north of Baunilorotha.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The settlement dated back to the ancient giant realm of Ostoria , and fell into ruin following that kingdom's collapse.</p>
<p>As the Great Glacier melted in the 15 th century DR and began to retreat northward, giants began to return to the area to reestablish the ancient subkingdom of Kultaakarr. As of the 1480 DR , a new generation of titan lords had excavated Baunilorotha and were using the ruins as their realm's capital.</p>
