<p>The Mandible was the most powerful gang operating in Skullport in the late 15th century DR. Next to the Skulls of Skullport The Mandible was the closest thing to a government the town had. The gang took its name from a sword known as Dragon's Tooth which was found in the ruins of the old town. The sword served as a badge of office for the gang's leader and, since gang members bickered frequently amongst themselves, possession of the sword changed hands often.</p>
