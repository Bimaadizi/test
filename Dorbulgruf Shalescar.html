<p>Dorbulgruf Shalescar ( pronounced : /ˈ d ɔːr b ʊl l g r ʌ f ˈ ʃ eɪ l s k ɑːr / DOR-bull-gruf SHAYL-scar ) was the speaker of Bremen during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was an even-tempered individual who always welcomed those that visited his town.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dorbulgruf Shalescar was the son Rölph Bremen and arrived to Icewind Dale with his caravan that would eventually found the town of Bremen, some three centuries before the 14 th century DR , when he jokingly called himself to be the oldest thing in Icewind Dale, except for dragons and the Dwarven Halls. Eventually, Dorbulgruf relocated to Ironmaster , only to move to Bremen after an accident in the mines made him realize he needed to move above ground. Eventually Dorbulgruf opened a shop in Bremen.</p>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , a large pack of yetis attacked the town of Bremen. During the invasion, Dorbulgruf witnessed local mage , whom the dwarf held in high esteem, despite her elvish blood, Legodia Half-Elven , being ripped apart by a massive abominable yeti as she tried to defend the town with her spells . Dorbulgruf survived with the Hero of Neverwinter 's timely intervention, too late to save Legodia. With Speaker Gil Haerngen ordering evacuation, Dorbulgruf, for the time being, abandoned his shop and offered an enchanted heavy crossbow and a handful of magic ammunition to the Hero of Neverwinter, free of charge.</p>
<p>After Bremen was partially destroyed in a flood, he was unrelenting in his efforts to help with reconstruction efforts. After earning the town's respect and their gratitude, Dorbulgruf was nominated as its speaker.</p>
