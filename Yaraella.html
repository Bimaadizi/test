<p>Yarealla was a powerful Rashemi witch who had an extremely strong connection to the spirit world. In 1480 DR she was driven mad and apparently committed suicide, leaving her young daughter behind. In reality, Yarealla was murdered by the Wychlaren Sree because of Yarealla's refusal to join the Wychlaren and because Sree wanted to raise Yarealla's child as a Wychlaren.</p>
<p>Yarealla didn't go quietly to the grave. Her spirit began haunting her village, casuing crops to fail and agitating the native spirits of Rashemen. Yarealla's spirit reached out to the shadar-kai witch Ilvani who also had a strong connection to the spirit world. Yarealla began haunting Ilvani's dreams which caused the creatures of the Shadowfell to go mad whenever Ilvani was near.</p>
<p>In 1480 DR, Ilvani set out with a caravan to Rashemen to seek out the Wychlaren and the source of her haunting. The witches were able to perform a ritual which put Yarealla's spirit at rest.</p>
