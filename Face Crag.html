<p>Face Crag was a cleft located along the Trade Way between Scornubel and Triel .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Face Crag was a cleft with a stream across the middle, which crossed the Trade Way . It had an eastern bed, strongly implying it was split north-south. The rock formation was bigger than Orcskull Rise , and visible from afar.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Decades prior to 1357 DR , a merchant had placed several braziers around Face Crag. When lit at dark, they concealed those camping on the eastern side of the cleft from sight, making the area more defensible.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the first murder in Orthil Voldovan 's caravan in late 1357 DR , he sought to make it to Face Crag, expecting attack from the locals in the Blackrocks otherwise. He made it there before nightfall.</p>
<p>Belgon Bradaskor , when asked by Sharantyr how to find Orthil Voldovan's caravan, was directed there. She arrived there soon, but to do so, she had to ride the horse Flamewind too severely. Nonetheless, the horse accompanied her there.</p>
