<p>Larethar Gulgrin was a gold dwarf rogue from Luskan who became embroiled in stopping the balor Belaphoss from ascending to the position of demon lord in the 1490s DR.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Larethar was a rude, wise-cracking rogue, whose talents lay chiefly in consuming alcohol, stealing, and simple thuggery. However, when traveling with Illydia Maethellyn , his moon elf friend and ally, Larethar's life took on an entirely different meaning. With Illydia, Larethar could be a champion of good, and he felt deeply honored to be allowed to travel alongside her.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>His closest friend was Illydia Maethellyn.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Larethar carried an enchanted shortsword called the Bastard's Inheritance . The dwarf's stories of acquiring the blade changed with each retelling, either because if his bad memory or unwillingness to disclose.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Larethar was born in the city of Westgate on the Dragon Coast . His family was originally from the East Rift , but his father moved them to Westgate prior to Larethar's birth, seeking to make his fortune by smuggling goods and bribing officials for shipping contracts. Although he was initially successful and grew rich very rapidly, Larethar's father was eventually murdered by rivals. Larethar's mother, who disapproved of her husband's criminal activities, had anticipated the murder. Hoping for a fresh start, she brought Larethar and his siblings on a caravan to Luskan .</p>
<p>In an attempt to make an honest living, Larethar's mother open a shop in Luskan with gold she had squirreled away over the years. She also got Larethar an apprenticeship with a local mason, who unfortunately turned out to be a bit of a thug. Larethar was a terrible mason, but showed skill as a thief, and soon turned to breaking and entering, mugging people and other forms of stealing to make a living.</p>
<p>Larethar never revealed his real line of work to his mother. Only after she died did his conscience catch up to him, and he started second guessing his path in life.</p>
<p>Luckily, a short time after the death of his mother, he met Illydia Maethellyn , who would become a dear friend of his.</p>
