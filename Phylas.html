<p>Phylas was a sailor in a fishing vessel that offered to carry Taegan Nightwind and Jivex from Elmwood to Thentia ; the ship returned to fishing on Mirtul 19 of 1373Â DR after their two passengers left it. He was uneasy with dragons, given the Rage of Dragons , but showed some shame after expressing it, once Taegan reminded him of Karasendrieth .</p>
