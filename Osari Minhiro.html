<h2>History</h2>
<p>Minhiro was born to the Osari clan in the village of Osata on the Fochu Peninsula .</p>
<p>At a young age, during a sea voyage with his parents, wako pirates attacked the ship and only Minhiro survived thanks to a jellyfish sent by Ababuio , the deity of good luck.</p>

<p>After the deaths of all of his daughters before they reached 16 years old around 1348 DR , Minhiro retired to live alone and divorced from Toshi, who instead went to work in the village of Seinin .</p>
<p>In 1358 DR , a number of strange killings plagued Fochu and Toshi was killed. Soon after, her ghost appeared to Minhiro in a dream explaining that she had been killed by the minions of Za-Jikku and asked her ex-husband's help to stop the evil.</p>
<p>First, Minhiro told everything to his nephew but Daizan acted too slowly and Minhiro decided to act without the government's support.
Under Toshi's instructions, Minhiro traveled to far Tempat Larang , where he asked for the help of an adventuring party sent there by the Emperor of Shou Lung .</p>
<p>Minhiro said that Toshi had told him that he needed their help to travel to Qui and stop Za-Jikku, a potential menace to all Kara-Tur . They had to enter the demiplane of Qui in order to stop the evil.</p>
