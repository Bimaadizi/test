<p>Milvarune was a major port city in the nation of Thesk in the Northeast Faerûn , on the Sea of Dlurg and nested among the Dragonjaw Mountains .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Even after the Tuigan war, Milvarune stood stoically above the waters of the Sea of Dlurg. The sea shores were clustered with tall stone buildings, and its harbors were decorated with multicolored sails and flags of ships from all across the Sea of Fallen Stars . The city's east gate was the location of a caravanserai , perched against the western city wall, that serviced traveling merchants.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Milvarune stood on the northern shores Sea of Dlurg, the body of water shaped like a large bay, protected from storms and rough weather of the Sea of Fallen Stars. Milvarune was connected to the city of Thassalra to the north via an active trade route that split into two further north. The eastern part of the road reached Phent and merged into the Golden Way . The road between Milvarune and Thassalra was a narrow and steep route that cut across the shortest portion of the Dragonjaw Mountains. There existed several other paths across the mountains, but they were dangerous and not big enough to fit an ox cart.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>From the establishment of Milvarune and its existence as the capital of the kingdom of Milvarn , the rulership of the city and the nation laid in the hands of the High Mage of Milvarune. This form of government lasted until the death of the last High Mage – Lurskas after the formation of Thesk.</p>
<p>As of the late 14 th century DR, Milvarune practiced hereditary oligarchy, with the Merchant Prince leading the city, aided by the merchant council. The Merchant Prince of Milvarune represented their city in the larger Council of Thesk that controlled the nation. Despite being represented in the council, after the Tuigan war, Milvarune was a principality and technically not part of Thesk.</p>
<p>The Mindosel dynasty were the historic leaders of Milvarune. As of the late 14 th century DR, the family has been in power for several hundreds of years. Circa 1372 DR , the Merchant Prince of Milvarune was Auvur Mindosel .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>One of the main industries in Milvarune was fishing , and the city's main source of food was the bounty of the Sea of Fallen Stars. The Sea of Dlurg was considered to be one of the most abundant fishing spots across the entirety of the Inner Sea. Many ships that sailed the Sea of Fallen stars docked in Milvarune to sell their goods or replenish supplies and visit the town's quality inns and taverns. Some of the most common sea routes were Furthinghome of the neighboring Aglarond and the city of Telflamm .</p>
<p>Before the Tuigan invasion, Milvarune was a busy and prosperous caravan origin and destination for numerous merchants moving between it and Telflamm, through which, Milvarune's caravans sold their goods in Rashemen and even Thay . Eight years past the invasion, caravans were routinely moving to and from Milvarune even though the travel was much more perilous than before, and the number of caravans was significantly cut down. As of the mid-14 th century DR, the largest caravan leader in Milvarune was Lord Simgarde , who employed a hundred experienced mercenaries, owned dozens of horses , mules , oxen , and serviced by numerous clerks, drovers, and bankers.</p>
<p>By 1479 DR , Milvarune reestablished its connection with the western nation of Cormyr , and an envoy was assigned to maintain the relationship. Other trade partners of Milvarune were communities of rock gnomes of the Dragonjaw Mountains who supplied the city with gemstones and precious metals.</p>
<p>Steep taxation and import duty were implemented in Milvarune as of the late 15 th century DR. The taxes were aimed at financing repairs of aging streets, sewers, water pumps, and city walls. Most duties were applied to imported alcohol and could be as high as a silver per bottle, two silvers per keg, and four golds per cask , resulting in 20 percent taxation. To no surprise, this gave rise to smuggling in Milvarune.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Every spring, Milvarune celebrated the Dragon Day , a festival known for its riddle competitions between visiting gnomes and copper dragons of the Dragonjaw Mountains.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The City Militia of Milvarune counted almost 200 able-bodied warriors, and the Prince's Guard consisted of almost 60 experienced warriors, fighters , and paladins .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Milvarune was founded by Aubayreer , the first Mage-King in the Year of the Upright Man, 535 DR as the capital of the small kingdom of Milvarn. The city was founded by an influx of Impilturan emigrants in the region. Aubayreer's place on the throne was inherited by Mage-King Nytholops in the Year of the Sifting Sands, 642 DR . Another change of power took place in the Year of the Lost Lord, 719 DR as the throne was claimed by High Mage Lurskas .</p>
<p>In the Year of High Treachery, 752 DR , a gang of daring thieves stole Aubayreer's Workbook from Milvarune's royal libraries. By the Year of the Turning Wheel, 937 DR , the Alliance of the Cities of the Golden Way formed the nation of Thesk with Milvarune becoming its capital, eventually dissolving the kingdom of Milvarn. High Mage Lurskas retained his title and throne until his death, sometime after 937 DR. High Mage Jholnareer – the next High Mage, took the throne in the Year of the Wandering Gnome, 968 DR . High Mage in title only, he ruled as an Oligarch of Thesk.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Grotto, 1237 DR , Queen Thara Olósynne of Aglarond was wed to Elthar Mindosel of Milvarune, forging an alliance between Thesk and Aglarond that lasted well into and likely past the late 14 th century DR.</p>
<p>High Mage Jholnareer died in the Year of the Bold Knight, 1249 DR , marking it the official end of the kingdom of Milvarn. The rulership was passed onto the High Mage's second son Khalreer , the first King of Milvarune and the second Oligarch of Thesk.</p>
<p>The Year of the Turret, 1360 DR was ruinous to the nation of Thesk and the city of Milvarune. Its prosperity was majorly stifled by the ravaging barbarian horde from the east – the Grand Army of the Tuigan led by Yamun Khahan . The damage done by the invasion was still yet to be fully healed as of the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR . The once-prosperous caravan routes were left to be roamed by gangs of bandits, orcs , and other neer-do-wells. The strife also turned noble families and factions against each other, and the famous Theskian unity of the past was lost to petty squabbles and competitions for resources. Locals whispered about the source of the roaming bands of criminals being the doing of the dreaded Black Network . Despite that, Milvarune was the least damaged settlement in the whole of Thesk.</p>
<p>In 1368 DR, a menacing orcish tribe known as the Wolfheads attacked and raided caravans that moved between Milvarune and Thassalra and only caravans that spent extra coins on capable guards managed to reach their destinations.</p>
<p>As of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Prince Auvur Mindosel set his sight on the throne of the neighboring nation of Aglarond. He believed that he deserved the throne because of his ancestor Elthar Mindosel wed Queen Olósynne a century prior.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Notable Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The population of Milvarune was one of or possibly the most diverse group in Thesk. The majority of the inhabitants were humans , with the Theskians of Damaran descent being the main ethnic group. Other major human ethnicities included Aglarondans, Impilturans, and Shou, with a smaller number of Tuigans. The demihuman population included gnomes from the local mountains and Aglarondan half-elves as well as an occasional orc and dwarf . The many ethnic groups and races within Milvarune rarely squabbled, except for infrequent tensions between the Shou and Tuigans, who shared a tumultuous past.</p>
