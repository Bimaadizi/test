<p>Gallor was an "archaeologist" of sorts who partnered with one Charleston Nib in the 14 th century DR . Another perhaps more accurate description for Gallor was that of a "tomb raider".</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Unlike his partner Charleston, Gallor felt their team would be well-suited to sell the ancient items and artifacts they found, rather than donate them to museums.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Gallor and Charleston began excavation on the Sword Coast and uncovered a long-extinct temple-village. The inhabitants of this ancient settlement once worshiped the god Kozah .</p>
<p>During the dig, Gallor planned on having Charleston killed and taking over their operation.</p>
