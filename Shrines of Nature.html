The shrine dedicated to Mielikki was commonly known as the Lady's Hands . While the shrine dedicated to Silvanus was known by many names, including Seatrees Shrine , the Green Garden , the Quiet Place , and Oakenshade House .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This temple complex was located in Waterdeep's Sea Ward , between Bliss Street , Ivory Street , and the Street of Whispers .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>This temple complex garden was walled-in, surrounded by an iron fence, and was very forested. It had a number of beautiful fountains, statues, and shrines within.</p>
<p>Two buildings stood inside the complex. For much of their existence, both buildings stood only a single story tall, but by 1372 DR they had each gotten an additional floor.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These shrines to Mielikki and Silvanus were once separate, unaffiliated structures, but sometime around 1367 DR they merged to become a temple complex and took up the name "Shrines of Nature".</p>
<p>In 1368 DR , the Shrines of Nature was one of the many temples within Waterdeep to receive an endowment from the nobleman Ultas Maernos .</p>
<p>By the 15 th century DR , the scope of the temple complex grew to honoring other nature deities in addition to Mielikki and Silvanus. By this time they also began to deny entry to those who weren't residents of the Sea Ward.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Prior to becoming a temple complex, the high priests Anarakin Iriboar and Briosar Helmsing ran their respective shrines to Silvanus and Mielikki. In addition, the shrine to Mielikki had a ranger -priest by the name of Tehtira Bellsilver . Once their shrines joined together into a temple complex, these high priests continued to be its operators. There were also a number of priestesses that worked within the complex.</p>
