<p>Drow green wine or ulaver , sometimes simply called green wine , was a type of alcoholic beverage fermented with vegetation and fungus of the Underdark .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A typical drow green wine recipe consisted of orbloren , a type of subterranean mushroom, distilled in water and juice of marrult , another species of Underdark fungi. Orbloren mushrooms were boiled in water with added crushed marrult. It was impossible to distill orbloren without the use of marrult as it produced the richest and most valuable drow green wine. The more marrult was added the more flavor the final product had.</p>
<p>The distilled liquid was captured via a cool metallic hood or a bowl hung over the boiling mushroom liquid. The condensation was collected into vessels and chilled in cold underground streams for around forty days. If immature green wine was consumed, it left an unpleasant burning sensation in the imbiber's throat and tongue. Sometimes a few crystals of salt were used to clarify drow green wine if it came out murky. This alcoholic drink could be kept for years after distillation. If the wine was boiled, it quickly turned oily black and became unpalatably burnt tasting.</p>
<p>Contrary to many beliefs, drow green wine was not concocted using spider venom .</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
