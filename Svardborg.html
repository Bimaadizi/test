<p>Svardborg was a frost giant fortress built atop an iceberg in the Sea of Moving Ice . After Ordning of the giants was destroyed, it came under the control of Jarl Storvald as he sought to increase the standing of his kin by bringing about the Age of Everlasting Ice on Toril .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It was a completely isolated settlement situated on top of an ice formation that closely resembled the hundreds that surrounded it.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>The fortress comprised a number of old frost giant hunting lodges, arranged in a circle around a central peak of ice. The core of the iceberg was hollow and flooded with water from the surrounding sea. This created a well-guarded dock that housed the frost giants' vessels.</p>
<p>One of the recovered lodges served as a home for the Jarl, another as a barracks for the frost giants, while the temple of Thrym housed a white dragon .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>While the fortress was protected by over a dozen frost giants there were no structural defenses. The giants believed its remote location precluded its discovery.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the age of Ostoria , Svardborg was an isolated frost giant hunting village. When the giant empire fell, the berg on which the settlement was built floated north into the Sea of Moving Ice. The settlement became covered in ice due to the freezing temperatures of the far north.</p>
<p>Some time later, the mated pair of white dragons, Cryovain and Isendraug formed their lair and accompanying nest within Svardborg's temple.</p>
<p>After the destruction of the Ordning by Annam All-Father , Jarl Storvald sailed to Svardborg aboard the Krigvind and reclaimed the home of his ancestors. He planned to use the settlement as a base from which he could recover the Ice that Never Melts .</p>
<p>Just after the giants reclaimed the village, they found a clutch of eggs left by the pair. The giants blackmailed the dragons into servitude, and locked up Isendraug in Svardborg and bound Cryovain to the Krigvind .</p>
