<p>Azaltin Ibn Issad was a powerful sorcerer who ruled the city of Al-Anwahr during the 5 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Azaltin was a lich as of 1367 DR. He appeared to be a shriveled husk of a man who stood 5 feet and 6 inches (170 centimeters) tall. His skin was blackened by the sun and pulled tight over his bones. His eyes were completely white and he always seemed to have a sad expression on his face. Azaltin always spoke in a soft whisper.</p>
<p>When traveling throughout Zakhara , Azaltin often cloaked his appearance with magic and masqueraded as a sage named Nerim .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Azaltin, depsite being a lich, was humble and noble.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was born into the ruling family of Al-Anwahr 968 years ago.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Azaltin mastered the sorcerous magics of sand and wind . A powerful stoneskin spell protected him from a slew of physical attacks. Since his immortality protected him against the abuse of such powerful magic, Azaltin often used wishes and limited wishes to his advantage. Though he possessed truly powerful magic, he usually only used it to defend himself.</p>
<p>He was one of only several people in Zakhara who spoke the ancient language of Al-Anwahr– Old Anwahran .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Azaltin wore a powerful aba of protection , a fez of disguise , a ring of multiple wishes , a ring of spell turning , and a special ring of invisibility that also cloaked any sounds he made. Other magic items he carried included a portable hole , a crystal ball , a staff of the winds , a soundstaff , and several magical scrolls .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Azaltin was visited by the Loregiver during her quest to spread Enlightenment throughout the Land of Fate. He abused his power as her host and forced her to reveal the secret to attaining immortality with the defense that it would make him a better king. He was successful in attaining everlasting life, but at the cost of the respect of his subjects who viewed him as a monster.</p>
<p>The lich was then betrayed by his vizier, Zeenab , who attempted to seize power through Azaltin's brother Amakim ibn Issad during a revolt. The revolution succeeded but at the cost of the very city they were fighting for which was left in ruins. The victorious Amakim led his followers north to found the city of Muluk .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Azaltin was interested in restoring his name and seeing the history of his once great city remembered accurately. He was concerned with the rising power of the Brotherhood of the True Flame , whom he believed was a threat to lasting peace in Zakhara. Azaltin viewed himself as the unrecognized protector of Zakhara's history.</p>
