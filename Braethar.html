<p>Braethar was a powerful Amnian mercantile family during the 11 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Braethars helped end the venerable Torlath dynasty with the help of their archrivals, the Villax family. King Niskam the Doomed took the throne in the Year of the Crested Thrush, 1094 DR , following the assassination of his great-grandfather King Imnel IV , and he was quickly slain in turn by agents of the Braethars. King Rhor the Lackey was installed as the puppet of the Braethars, but he was killed in the Year of the Dawndance, 1095 DR , by agents of the Villaxes as they installed King Dornak the Puppet King . King Dornak was then quickly slain, and the chaos only ended with the rise of King Erdhinn Wavegold I .</p>
