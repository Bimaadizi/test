<p>Jamzo Bakadi and his brother, Jemzo Bakadi , were prominent thieves from Memnon of Calimshan circa 972 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jamzo and Jemzo grew up on the hot, sweaty streets of Memnon, surviving on crime and thefts. Eventually, they proved to be the finest rogues to have ever been born in the hot Calishite city. They quickly gained a legendary reputation for their skills, cunning, and bravery. The infamy led them to head one of the major crime cartels of Calimshan.</p>
<p>Sometime circa 972 DR, the brothers came up with a plan to pull off the greatest heist of a lifetime. They disappeared in almost complete secrecy, never to be seen again with only the cartel's lieutenant knowing the thieves' brazen plot.</p>
<p>Bakadi brothers set out to rob a great warrior - wizard Sunder Halyndliam of his magical treasures but failed as was evident by their skulls being stored in the mage's crypt underneath Liam's Hold , after it was briefly opened in 1372 DR . The wizard's punishment must've been grand as the skulls showed signs of arcane tinkering and turned into a powerful artifact known as the Bone Brothers Bakadi .</p>
