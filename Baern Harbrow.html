<p>Baern Harbrow was a War Wizard of Cormyr in Suzail during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was rather smug and unpleasant.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He carried a wand of sleep and likely some enchanted rings .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the aftermath of the calamitous Council of the Dragon in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Baern Harbrow, alongside no less than eight Purple Dragons and four more Wizards of War , was guarding the Hall of Victories .</p>
<p>Just as Glathra Barcantle was about to order the capture of the mask dancer and coinlass , Amarune Whitewave , and the Marchioness Immerdusk , Storm Silverhand , Baern Harbrow magically farspoke to Glathra and reported to Glathra that Lord Arclath Delcastle , one of the guests at Council, had cut through his defenses with the aid of the ghost of the princess Alusair Obarskyr . She ordered him to continue defending his post, and after a brief struggle with Storm Silverhand, ordered him to capture the two of them, as they were headed his way. She also warned him that Storm Silverhand could reflect spells.</p>
<p>Once Amarune and Storm arrived, Baern Harbrow put her to sleep with his wand; the war wizards with them then converged on Storm Silverhand, but she reflected their sleep magic with a special ring that allowed her to reflect all five spells on Harbrow himself, putting him out of commission. She later stole his wands and rings.</p>
