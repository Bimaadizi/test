<p>Orbs were a type of arcane implement used by spellcasters to focus their spells.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Orbs all shared their spherical shape, though many were constructed from different materials or were different colors.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The primary use of orbs was to channel the spellcasting powers of arcane spellcasters such as bards , sorcerers , warlocks or wizards , aiding them when casting their spells. By doing so, someone using an orb as a spellcasting focus could eschew most of the more ordinary material components required for a spell.</p>
<p>Some orbs had powers that varied wildly, though many were typically psychic in nature, allowing wizards to attack the mind of their foes or to see into places beyond sight. Some could be used to identify magic items .</p>
