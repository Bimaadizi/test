<p>Yaravindar Ipurnos was one of the last surviving Imaskari . He lived within the Violet Spire , in the Glittering Mountains , as of 1372Â DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Yaravindar had extended his lifespan several times over through magic. He was a young mage during the destruction of the empire. His master, Ondbiras , teleported him to a safe house in the Glittering Spires during the battle that finally destroyed Inupras . His master never returned; when the apprentice returned to Imaskar, he found nothing but ruins and dust. Salvaging what he could, he returned to the Glittering Mountains and built the Violet Spire using elemental slaves.</p>
<p>The ancient wizard maintained most of his age-old beliefs about human superiority and still held gods in great contempt. Although he saw nothing wrong with enslavement of other races, he had mostly given up on that because of the hassle in managing them; his slender purple granite minaret was protected and staffed by a host of summoned elementals and surviving Imaskari constructs . The tower spurned doors, instead employing keyed portals for access and egress. The artificer richly rewarded Tuigan nomads who brought ancient Imaskari magic to him.</p>
