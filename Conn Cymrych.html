<h2>Relationships</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Conn assumed the throne of the High King in the Year of the False Smile, 852 DR , following the death of his father, who went down in a sea battle against Illuskan invaders and took the Crown of the High King with him. Conn survived the battle and managed to save the Sword of Cymrych Hugh —another symbol of his family's authority—but the loss of the battle and of the crown eroded his authority. While the many lords of the Ffolk still acknowledged him as the undisputed High King, they paid no attention to him. As a result, the Ffolk's response to the Northmen raids and land grabs over the following decades was disorganized and largely ineffective.</p>
<p>Conn ruled for thirty-three years before also dying in battle against the Northmen in the Year of the Thistle, 885 DR .</p>
