<p>The Seven Wanderers were a special type of undead that roamed the High Desert of Zakhara . Created from hideous water deprivation experiments by the House of Dhi'b , the wanderers were terrible abominations.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Wanderers looked like human corpses that had crimson eyes and tough leathery gray skin. They wore shredded abas and carried weathered scimitars . They would also mutter incomprehensible phrases as they walked.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>The Seven Wanderers constantly roamed the High Desert in search of water, which they could sense from a mile away. Wanderers usually traveled at night. A wanderer would instantly travel toward the water once it was detected, attacking anything in its path. Once near the source of water, the wanderer would raise its arms high above its head and the water would instantly vanish.</p>
