<p>The Nakalpgotak Sea was a large sea in the Alpuk region of the Great Glacier .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Nakalpgotak Sea was a massive inland sea bordered to the north by the mountains of Nakvaligach and the east by the Keryjek Ridge . A network of shallow streams linked the Nakalpgotak Sea with the Lugalpgotak Sea . With a shape similar to a bowl, the Nakalpgotak Sea was 120 miles (190 kilometers) long with steep shores, some with a sheer 45° angle. The center of the sea had a depth of 700 feet (210 meters).</p>
<p>The majority of the Nakalpgotak Sea was filled with thick pack ice and a large portion of the shore had massive walls of barrier ice, with an average height of 100​ to ​200 feet (30​ to ​61 meters). Floating within the sea were icebergs, some as long as 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) and as tall as mountains. During the warmer months of the year, meltwater from the mountains rushed into the sea, causing the water level to rise significantly.</p>
<h2>Flora & Fauna</h2>
<p>Due to the low population of humans , the lake was home to a thriving population of polar bears and winter wolves . These predators fed on the large populations of fish, birds, and seals that lived within the sea.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the summer of −760 DR , an unseasonal heat wave caused a massive flood, inundating dozens of Iulutiun villages that were located near the eastern and northern shores. As a result, thereafter few Iulutiuns would settle near the sea.</p>
