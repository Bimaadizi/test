<p>The Quiet Multitude was a religious organization in Zakhara whose members followed the teachings of Selan , the Zakharan goddess of beauty.</p>
<p>The Quiet Multitude did not have a favored weapon or symbol.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Mystics of the Quiet Multitude worshiped Selan by meditating under the moonlight. As of 1367 DR , there were dozens of sub-sects of the Quiet Multitude across Zakhara, each with their own unique way of worshiping the goddess. The different sects usually did not get along with each other.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>Beginning in the mid 1200s DR , the Quiet Multitude rapidly spread throughout all of Zakhara, creating unique sects within every major city on the continent.</p>
