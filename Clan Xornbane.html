<p>Clan Xornbane was a duergar mercenary band in the Underdark that was led by Khorrl Xornbane .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Clan Xornbane consisted of several thousand duergar. When their leader Khorrl entered Ched Nasad in 1372 DR , he counted more than 20 wagons, plus more were coming. At that time, they were equipped with crossbows and stonefire firepots.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1372 DR , Clan Xornbane was hired by the Ched Nasadan drow House Zauvirr through a liaison named Zammzt (secretly an agent of the Jaezred Chaulssin ). The band was to fight and destroy House Melarn . However, Zammzt instructed them to attack too early. They successfully killed Matron Mother Drisinil Melarn but House Zauvirr's captives escaped and the duergar contributed to the chaos in Ched Nasad that led to its ultimate destruction. Matron Mother Ssipriina Zauvirr attacked Khorrl, killing him; the band fled the city.</p>
