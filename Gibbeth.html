<p>Gibbeth was a star-like Elder Evil from the Far Realm who had taken a place among the stars of Realmspace . Unlike normal stars, Gibbeth didn't have a fixed place in the sky but instead danced and wavered across Realmspace.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gibbeth was described as a green star that at its core had an utterly unknowable being.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gibbeth and the other Far Realm–infested stars of Realmspace were somehow related to the Eldest .</p>
<p>Scholars who studied stars avoided studying or even talk about Gibbeth. It was believed that Gibbeth's true form was a being of madness, and that this madness was contagious and even dangerous. Even a minor contact with its madness was able to create an aberrant creature known as the Scion of Gibbeth.</p>
<p>It was also believed that, when Gibbeth revealed its true form at the end of time, reality would be unmade just by its gaze.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, and despite all the dangers, Gibbeth was usually sought out by some warlocks to make a pact with it. Neogi were specially adept in seeking out pacts with it and the other Far Realm–infested stars.</p>
