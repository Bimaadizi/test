<p>The Furniture's Fate was a tavern in the town of Thunderstone in Cormyr circa 1369 DR owned by Boffo Arglebargle Cosgrove Bullwubble II .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The tavern was popular with adventurers operating out of Thunderstone, and thus it was a good spot to hear their stories.</p>
<p>As the name suggested, brawls were common, especially those that resulted in broken furniture. The signboard above the door even depicted a chair being broken over a person's head.</p>
<p>Tavernkeeper Boffo, being an eccentric prankster, was usually at the center of these brawls. When he wasn't, he usually had his bouncer Stig lift him up and hurl the gnome into the fray.</p>
