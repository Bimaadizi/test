<p>The Web Mountains was a mountainous area in the Utter East , lying where the Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains joined the World Pillar Mountains . The Web Mountains served as a pass between these ranges.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Web Mountains were defined by a complex maze of gorges constantly filled with dense mist. A river ran through these gorges, fed by a small waterfall in the northwest. In these gorges there sometimes rose stacked pillars of massive boulders. Between the gorges, the land comprised an array of small, high, steep-sided plateaus. Travelers and armies could cross between plateaus via a series of shabby wooden bridges, both beam bridges and simple suspension bridges. Needless to say, it was easy to get lost in such a place.</p>
<p>The land was dry and rocky with occasional conifer trees, some alive and some dead. A forest of them grew in the southeast.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Beefy, club-wielding trolls stood their ground in the Web Mountains. Rocs made their great nests on the high plateaus.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the time of the Bloodforge Wars ( 648 – 657 DR ), the Web Mountains were the site of bloodforge battles fought between Roxanna , princess of Edenvale , and the suitors who sought to win her hand in marriage, in the conflict known as Matchmaker Mayhem . At one point, Roxanna might have retreated into the Web Mountains to avoid assaults on Edenvale Castle , but Connor the Clever would pursue them. At another point, Roxanna and Bryan the Bold might have competed to seize the other's treasures hidden in the Web Mountains.</p>
<p>Some time after, Olgala Zug laid claim to the pass and extracted a toll from travelers. However, the leader of the Legendary Campaign elected to fight a bloodforge battle against Zug instead.</p>
<p>Later, one Dawn Mac Dare made camp in the Web Mountains, from which they advanced on the Legendary Campaign forces, desiring to take advantage of the leader's mission to unify and pacify the Utter East through conquest. Warned of the attack by the army's southern guard, the leader struck at Mac Dare's forces in a bloodforge battle.</p>
<p>Finally, the leader of the Legendary Campaign pursued Anson Darkeye into the Web Mountains, but became lost. Darkeye turned the tables and turned back on the Legendary Campaign, forcing them into a defensive bloodforge battle.</p>
