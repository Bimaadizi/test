<p>The Mountains of Amara were a range in northern Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The mountain range was found to the east of the larger Koryaz Mountains , bordering the low-lying Ama Basin and the Yellow Sea . To the south lay the Bang Zi Mara Shan mountains closer to Chukei and the island of Talmaruk , and to the west deep within the mountains was the Valley of Nanayok . At the northeast edge of the Mountains of Amara was the fallen Netherese enclave of Urvraunt , a long-lost and never rediscovered ruin.</p>
