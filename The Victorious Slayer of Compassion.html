<p>The Victorious Slayer of Compassion , nicknamed Victoricus by Marrec, was a demon who aided Marrec and his party when they sought the Queen Abiding 's controlling token in 1373 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Victorious Slayer of Compassion approximately resembled a wolf, made of blackened ice in a mockery of life. Its eye sockets held red, twinkling hellfire. The creature stank of a frozen corpse, and spoke with a voice that was stark and devoid of warmth. By rubbing its forearms (or forelegs) together, it could make a nerve-wracking trilling sound.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The Victorious Slayer of Compassion often tittered, giggled and laughed, amongst other unnerving noises. It also spat chunks of phlegm-coated ice sometimes.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As other demons of its kind, The Victorious Slayer of Compassion hovered slightly above the ground, never really touching it, moving smoothly any but the most obstructed terrain, such as stairs or overly thick rubble. It was also possessed of sufficient physical strength to challenge even demon lords such as Eschar or break down iron doors. Even upon destruction, the Queen Abiding reconstituted it without sparing a thought. She also called it by the nickname the mortals had given it, suggesting that it shared some of its perception and memories with the Queen Abiding.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1373 DR , after Fallon and Araluen crossed the Barrow of the Queen Abiding , they woke up the demons in that vault. The Victorious Slayer of Compassion lured Marrec 's party to the Barrow of the Queen Abiding with promises of a deal; after they accepted to recover her controlling token, it joined their ranks. Marrec nicknamed the demon Victoricus. After it was destroyed by Eschar , the Queen Abiding reconstituted it upon her release, and bade it accompany them to the exit, where it promptly disintegrated again.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Victoricus was a servant of the Queen Abiding. The Queen's barrow also held a number of other, similar demons, all of which were her servants.</p>
