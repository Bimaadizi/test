<p>A cow was a type of herd animal that was used for the production of beef and milk, the latter of which could be turned into cheese .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Cows could charge their opponents in battle, as well as gore them with their horns.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>Many recipes throughout the Realms required products specifically from cows, such as pepper cheese and later varieties of Elturian Grey , which used cheese, and breek , which used beef. Such products were exported across Faerûn , as well as cows themselves, i.e. , from Chessenta and Saradush .</p>
<p>Inhabitants across Faerûn were known for naming buildings such as taverns after the creatures, such as the Happy Cow in Daggerford , and the Blue Cow in Saerloon .</p>
<p>A cow usually sold for about ten gold pieces , and they were often used as trade goods.</p>
