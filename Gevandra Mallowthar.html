<p>Gevandra Mallowthar , lovingly nicknamed the Evening Rose , was the first Lady of Graces in service of the Court of King Foril Obarskyr I of Cormyr in the early-to-mid–15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gevandra was a stunningly beautiful woman with dark blue eyes and hair. Her uncanny hair color was natural and by many accords, was the result of her half-elven bloodline. These features earned her the Evening Rose moniker.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>As a lady of the Court, Gevandra resided within a suite in the Court of Cormyr . Her quarters were in the western end of the Royal Court, along with the receiving room, connected to the suites via a circular staircase. The receiving room was named Font of Grace, while the chambers were later named after Gevandra Mallowthar—the Rose Rooms.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gevandra Mallowthar left her office in the Year of the Forged Sigil, 1459 DR , and was succeeded by Brunzarra Hethcanter , the second Lady of Graces of Cormyr.</p>
