<p>Raerboth was the 33rd Obarskyr monarch and a king of Cormyr . He was the only legitimate son of King King Ulbaeram . Like so many of his kin, he was killed by his aunt Gorauna . His son, Baerildo was next in line for the throne, but Baerildo was also killed by Gorauna while still an infant, and so Raerboth's half brother Belmuth "the Bastard" next took the throne.</p>
