<p>Nunivytt Threskaal was the eighth High Mage of Silverymoon .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Nunivytt served as High Mage for over a century from the Year of Great Riches, 920 DR , to the Year of the Keening Gale, 1050 DR . He held the title of High Mage for longer than anyone before him, and in future years only Alustriel Silverhand would hold the title for longer. In the Year of the Muster, 990 DR , he stripped the title of Warlord from Tulven because of his abuse of power. Nunivytt then decreed that henceforth the title of Warlord would only be granted during times of great need.</p>
<p>Nunivytt died of natural causes in 1050 DR .</p>
