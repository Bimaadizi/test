<h2>History</h2>
<p>Xoblob survived the detonation of a gas spore in the Underdark , which caused him to inherit a few beholder mannerisms and memories. Driven by a compulsion for power, the deep gnome settled in Waterdeep and bought the Old Xoblob Shop. First he tried to rename the shop after himself but everyone kept calling it the Old Xoblob Shop. So he decided instead to restore the old name and changed his personal name to Xoblob.</p>
<p>A few years after settling in Waterdeep, in 1492 DR , Xoblob witnessed the kidnapping of Renaer Neverember and Floon Blagmaar by some Zhentarim agents but was reluctant to speak about it.</p>
