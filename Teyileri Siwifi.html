<p>Teyileri Siwifi was a wealthy young woman in Port Nyanzaru , Chult , during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She had a bold sense of style and sought to impress those to whom she spoke, if not stun them into silence.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Her father was a close associate of the merchant prince Wakanga O'tamu , and she was known to spend time at the prince's villa to enjoy his menagerie.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the events of the death curse , Teyileri was embarrassed while giving a toast when a man rudely interrupted her. Seeking to make sure it did not happen again, her best solution was to acquire three magnificent necklaces —fashioned from rubellite , silverspruce , and sphene —believing that wearing such items would clearly convey her importance. She therefore contacted the Master of the Market to commission the pieces.</p>
