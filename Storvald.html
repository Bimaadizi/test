<p>Jarl Storvald was the ruler of the frost giants in the late 15 th century DR , at time of the shattering of the ordning .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, after the disappearance of storm giant king Hekaton , all giant lords started their path to reshape the ordning. Storvald first led his minions to reclaim Svardborg on the Sea of Moving Ice , the ancestral home of the frost giants, and managed also to enslave a pair of white dragons .</p>
<p>Later, Storvald planned to find the fabled Ring of Winter in order to start a new ice age, thus achieved frost giant supremacy. This led him to send his servant Drufi in pursuit of the bearer of the Ring , Artus Cimber , resulting in an attack on Bryn Shander and an ill-conceived expedition to Chult . Later, Storvald gained the allegiance of a tribe of Northlander barbarians and the alliance of the Zhentarim wizard Nilraun Dhaerlost , who was also interested in locating the Ring , and so he sent his minions in search of the artifact .</p>
<p>Often, Storvald left Svardborg in his colossal warship Krigvind ("Warwind") to hunt whales .</p>
