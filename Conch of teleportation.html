<p>A conch of teleportation was a device that allowed flawless teleportation to a single specified location.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The item was a large conch shell upon which the uvar ("storm") rune had been carved. Conches of teleportation were typically about 2.5 ft (76 cm) in length.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The item allowed the user to cast the teleport spell once to the location determined by the item's creator, who had inscribed the uvar rune on the shell. The spell always brought any creatures it transported flawlessly to the designated location with no chance of error. The conch regained its magic at dawn.</p>
