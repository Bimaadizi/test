<h2>History</h2>
<p>Silk and other expensive fabrics were the focus of the House of Al-Kamari. The merchant house was able to instill pride in their workers, earning their careful attention to detail when handling the delicate silk . Much of their silk came from large mulberry orchards located south of Huzuz. Silk moths fed on the mulberry until their cocoons were harvested. The Al-Kamari conducted experiments to see if spider silk would be another viable option.</p>
<p>Al-Kamari employed over 1,000 people in Huzuz, most of whom were women. They never hired anyone who had rough or calloused hands, fearing that a worker with rough hands would snag their silk.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Because of their corruption by the yikaria , which was unknown to the entirety of Huzuz, Al-Kamari were the unintentional enemies of the Grand Caliph .</p>
