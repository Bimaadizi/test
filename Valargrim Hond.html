In the Year of the Star Walker's Return, 1490 DR , after conferring with Mystra , Azuth offered the office of Magister to Valargrim Hond upon the retirement of Tannathra .</p>
<p>He defended his office through numerous duels until the Year of the Duplicitous Courtier, 1496 DR , when he was slain in the Eyes of the Beholder club in Ormpetarr , by six Red Wizards sent by Szass Tam . But his slayer never attained the powers of the office, as they were soon after killed by Handrar Rezgult , a Zhentarim mage who was staying in the city. And before he was able to attain the powers of the office, Valargrim Hond's enchanted daggers struck him down, and then escaped. Thus, Azuth offered the role of Magister to Ramarthant Horaerays .</p>
