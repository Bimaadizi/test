<p>Spheres , also known as the Winds of the Gods or Winds in ancient Netheril , referred to "spheres of influence" within the entirety of divine magic . Each deity had a set of spheres of influence in which they were interested and which they embodied. Priests of a deity had access to the spells in that deity's spheres. Some deities provided only limited access (called minor access ) to certain spheres and full access (called major access ) to others.</p>
<h2>Variations</h2>
<p>In the age of ancient Netheril, there were nine winds: Buffering , Perpetual , Predictable , Prevailing , Sporadic , Terrestrial , Transcendent , Wandering , and Zephyrous .</p>
<p>Originally, there were sixteen spheres: All , Animal , Astral , Charm , Combat , Creation , Divination , Elemental , Guardian , Healing , Necromantic , Plant , Protection , Summoning , Sun , and Weather . Eventually, eight new spheres were introduced: Chaos , Law , Numbers , Thought , Time , Travelers , War , and Wards .</p>
<p>The Elemental sphere was subdivided into Elemental Air , Earth , Fire , and Water spheres. The "All" sphere was available to every faith.</p>
<p>Maztican deities granted access to two unique spheres called hishna and pluma , but in return never gave their followers the Necromantic and Summoning spheres.</p>
