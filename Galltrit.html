<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Galltrits on average grew to be 0.5′0″‒0′6″ (0.15‒0.15 m) tall. Their bodies had stony grey skin. They were often very hard to detect.</p>

<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>Much like a vampire bat , the saliva of these creatures possessed both an anesthetic and anti-coagulant properties. This made it so that the nerves and skin around where a galltrit bit became temporarily deadened, preventing their victim from feeling anything, and prolonging the period of bleeding. They would then suck blood from their victim until either full or detected.</p>
