<p>Ulgar's Isle , or Ulgar Isle , was an island in the Pirate Isles in the Sea of Fallen Stars . It was inhabited by the Chessentan vampire Ulgar and his undead minions.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In an attempt to ally with Ulgar, the Twisted Rune sent shiploads of slaves to the isle for the vampire to feast upon. The organization hoped that satiating Ulgar's bloodlust would stabilize him enough for them to learn his secrets.</p>
