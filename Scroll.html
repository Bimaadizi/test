<p>A scroll is a rolled or folded document. Unlike a tome, a scroll is usually a single piece of parchment. Magical scrolls contain the words of a spell that is released when the caster reads the words on the page. Magical scrolls may be scribed by wizards , clerics , or druids .</p>
<p>Scrolls of the appropriate magic may be read by the classes that can scribe scrolls. In addition, rogues can read magic well enough to activate a scroll and occasionally other classes may have the ability to use scrolls although this may be risky for non magic-users.</p>
