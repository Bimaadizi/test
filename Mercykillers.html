<p>The Mercykillers , also known as the Red Death , were one of the fifteen sanctioned philosophical and political factions of the Outer Planes . Originally based in Sigil , and later the stronghold called the Tower of Law in the Astral Sea . The core tenet of this faction was that the entire multiverse would become better through justice, as justice would purge an individual's evil and make them better. Once everyone was cleansed, the multiverse would reach perfection.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The faction once ran the prison in Sigil, acting as the wardens and every so often hunting down those already condemned but not yet imprisoned. They did not make laws nor pass judgement, only administered punishment without leniency.</p>
<p>During the tenure of Factol Alisohn Nilesia , a select few Mercykillers chosen personally by the Factol herself became Justiciars and would hunt down those already convicted but yet to be imprisoned through the darkest pits and farthest points of the multiverse. They devoted their lives to chasing down heinous criminals that had slipped through the fingers of the law.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Mercykillers were originally based in the Sigil Prison from where they hunted down criminals of all types and brought them to justice. After the Faction War in Sigil, the remaining Mercykillers re-established themselves on a floating rock in the Astral Sea and built the Tower of Law, a grim fortress of fifteen levels, that held prisons, torture chambers, barracks, treasuries, and more. From this fastness they would mount forays into the other planes by way of a permanent teleportation circle inscribed in the Vanguard Room. They would round up prisoners accused of whatever crimes they decide upon during the raid and drag them back to their fortress to face the Red Death's brand of justice.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Mercykillers wore bladed armor and at least one pair of manacles . Often a mask or hood would obscure their faces, ensuring the face of justice was detached from its duty.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The faction was allied with the Harmonium and the Fraternity of Order , as the Harmonium patrolled and caught the criminals, the Fraternity of Order sentenced the criminals for their crimes, and the Mercykillers jailed the criminals and kept them imprisoned until their sentences were over. The Mercykillers saw the Sign of One , Society of Sensation , and Revolutionary League as enemies and often clashed with members of those factions, especially those of the Revolutionary League as they sought to destroy the other established factions, particularly those that held up the system of Sigil.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Mercykillers came to be during the Great Upheaval as the Sodkillers and Sons of Mercy united in their pursuit of justice and created their Eight Tenets of Justice more commonly known as the Mercykiller Code. For 633 years, they were the wardens and jailers of Sigil until the Faction War saw all factions disbanded or exiled from Sigil. The Mercykillers tore themselves back into the two factions of Sodkillers and Sons of Mercy, with the Sons of Mercy keeping the job as wardens of the Sigil prison. Many of those Mercykillers that were not in Sigil during this time however joined neither, and instead became roaming groups. That was until a Mercykiller named Andrezhej established a new fortress in the Astral Sea, and built the Tower of Law. From here the Mercykillers acted more like their Justiciars of old, hunting down and dragging back those who they thought guilty of crimes before either incarcerating them at the tower or executing them for their crimes.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>Members joined simply by showing up on the enlistment days that were held once every fortnight. If the potential member had no outstanding issues with the law and was willing to listen to the Eight Tenets of Justice and swear upon each one, then they were henceforth considered a Mercykiller.</p>
