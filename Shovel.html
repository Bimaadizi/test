<p>A shovel was a digging tool that had a curved blade on its end. A very similar tool was the spade .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The ideal shovel had a four-foot-long wooden handle and a curved metal head with a blunt edge, allowing it to carry soil and not be damaged from cutting into heavy earth. These digging and shoveling tools were used by workers and miners across Faerun , Kara-Tur , and Zakhara to excavate dirt, gravel, sand , clay , and other soft or loose materials from the ground. Instead of just being used as a tool, a shovel could also be used as a weapon . Hoes served a similar purpose in breaking up soil, though they were used quite differently.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue sold generic and specialized shovels. Basic coal shovels cost 2 gp , gardening and snow shovels cost 3 gp, whilst postholers cost 4 gp each. Small hand spades could be had for only 2 sp .</p>
<h2>Magic</h2>
<p>There were several magical shovels known around the multiverse .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Crystal Casket, 249 DR , the Magister Galeerie Mulurkrath was killed by a shovel to the head.</p>

<p>In Zakhara , the Pick and Shovel Corps was a group of ex- slaves that won their freedom. The "shovels" indicated the dwarf members of the corps.</p>
