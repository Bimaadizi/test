<p>Narwhals , sometimes known as unicorns of the ocean , were marine mammals known for their long horns.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Grown narwhals were large creatures, their bodies measuring somewhere between 20​ to ​40 feet (6.1​ to ​12 meters) in length, and with horns between 6​ to ​12 feet (1.8​ to ​3.7 meters) long. Their horns were sought after as a source of ivory and were capable of containing great amounts of magic .</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Narwhals were peaceful animals, but would defend themselves using their great horns if threatened or attacked.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>They were most often spotted in groups of between one and six individuals.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Although narwhales favored cold waters, they could be found in a variety of oceans, such as the Sea of Fallen Stars and Sea of Moving Ice .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Communities of sea elves and dolphins occasionally kept narwhals as pets and guardians. In the Sea of Fallen Stars, they were often employed as beasts of burden, owing to their strength and docile nature.</p>
<p>Narwhals were a favored animal of the Seldarine deity Deep Sashelas .</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>Some aquatic races, such as tritons , were known to use occasionally use narhwal horns as a substitute for magic staves because they could hold considerable amounts of magic. They also were one of the few underwater substances strong enough to handle being crafted into a staff of the magi or rod of lordly might .</p>
<h3>Summoning</h3>
<p>A narwhal could be summoned with the summon monster VI spell. For those mages specializing in sea magic the same summon monster VI spell would call upon 1 to 3 narwhals. The clerics of Deep Sashelas could summon between 5 and 8 narwhals with the spell summon cetacean depending on the size and power of the creatures, as long any were within 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) of the caster when the spell was cast.</p>
<h2>Magic</h2>
<p>With the spell Cetacean form clerics of Deep Sashelas could assume the form of a narwhal.</p>
