<p>Naglatha ( pronounced : / n ɑː g ˈ l ɑː θ ɑː / nahg-LATH-ah ), alias the Black Flame , was a Red Wizard of Thay residing in Selgaunt in Sembia in 1357 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Naglatha was a young, black-haired woman with a grim face.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Naglatha quickly rose through the ranks of the Red Wizards thanks to her fanatical zeal and ruthlessness. However, she was loyally devoted to the god Azuth .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Naglatha kept her devotion to Thay a secret from her associates in Selgaunt. She masqueraded as a merchant with a store that traded in magical items and curios from the South. Her shop was located on Larwaken Lane .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Naglatha arrived in Selgaunt early in 1357 DR with a very deep cover; even Alzegund was unaware of her identity as a Red Wizard of Thay . Everyone in the Dragon Reach area thought she was only a merchant with a preference for extravagant tools from south Faerûn . In truth, using the alias "the Black Flame", she was recruiting valorous men to Thay's cause. She always used a black mask in her mission in order to disguise her identity. Once a year she went "to the South" for three months, in truth traveling to Thay to receive new instructions.</p>
<p>Later she rose through the ranks thanks to the "accidental" death of Alzegund in 1364 DR . In 1373 DR , she was involved in a plot by the demon lord Eltab against Szass Tam , but the plan backfired thanks to the intervention of Thazienne Uskevren and Tam promised his vengeance against her.</p>
