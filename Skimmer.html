<p>A skimmer was a type of watercraft built and used in ancient Netheril , notably propelled by a captured being from the Elemental Plane of Air .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Skimmers were boats or ships that were pushed along by an elemental being of air. Depending on the type ensnared, they had different maximum speeds: aerial servants and tempests were the slowest (though still quite fast), arctic tempests were slightly faster, and sylphs and fully fledged air elementals were fastest of all.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Skimmers were first developed as small, fast boats that the youths of Netheril used to speed dangerously across the Moss . When it became known that the Moss was home to lethal gas pockets that slew the joyriders, the Moss was abandoned and the skimmers were instead used to zoom across the Marsh of Deception and Escalade Rill .</p>
<p>Once the magical technology matured, the principles came to be applied to other forms of watercraft. Large merchant skimmers on the Narrow Sea were used to transport cargo and passengers, and leisurely riverboat skimmers functioned as gambling halls and pleasure cruises that extracted money from patrons.</p>
<p>Late in Netheril's history, a variant was being developed that used other planar beings, but they had an almost even chance of gating the user to the creature's home planeâ€”a most unpleasant fate.</p>
