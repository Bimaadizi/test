<p>Around the year 1479 DR , some power called Madri's spirit back from the dead. The entity known as Fossil claimed her soul was linked to Demascus' sword Exorcessum and it was the sword's power that called her spirit. She made common cause with Fossil to hurry the reincarnation of the Rakshasa Kalkan , Demascus's arch enemy. She spied on Demascus in Airspur , apparently hoping to watch his demise at the hands of enemies. However, when Demascus was trapped by a cave-in on Ithimir Isle , Madri gave him a teleportation device that extricated him and saved his life.</p>
