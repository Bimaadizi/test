<p>Montaron was an agent of the Zhentarim who served the organization during the mid–14 th century DR alongside the necromancer known as Xzar .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Seeing himself as exceptionally skilled, Montaron preferred to work for the Black Network alone. He saw little value in the lives of others but believed himself destined for great things</p>
<p>He liked staying in cities more so than being out in nature, and would rather be out during all hours of the night.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Montaron and Xzar absolutely could not stand one another. Though they both held a shared hatred for the Harpers organization.</p>
<p>Over time Xzar developed some fondness for Montaron. When the halfling went missing, he was quite dedicated to ensuring his return.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Montaron and Xzar were tasked with investigating the iron crisis that plagued trade throughout the Sword Coast . They traveled along the Coast Way , en route to the Amnian town of Nashkel .</p>
<p>By the following year , the pair were still traveling through Amn and set up in the city of Athkatla . Montaron was captured by Galvarey 's group of Harpers and seemingly imprisoned within his estate in the form of a bird.</p>
<p>In fact Montaron was killed, and his "transformation" was just a ruse to draw out and assassinate his partner Xzar.</p>
