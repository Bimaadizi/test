<p>Ironspur was one of the three major dwarven holds in the northern Galena Mountains as of the 14 th century DR , along with Hillsafar Hall and Bloodstone Mines .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The city was a rugged settlement situated amidst harsh and dangerous mountainous terrain.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Ironspur was located on the edge of the Galena Mountains within the borders of the Duchy of Soravia in the Kingdom of Damara . It sat not far from the source of the Goliad River , connecting it to the town of Helmsdale and to the rest of Damara. It was connected to the city of Palischuk in Vaasa via the treacherous High Walk across the mountains.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The nearby mountains were mined for silver , iron , and bloodstone , while the city itself was renowned for its forges. Most food and agricultural products had to be imported from nearby Helmsdale.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the defeat of Zhengyi the Witch-King in the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , the dwarves of Ironspur helped to drive Zhengyi's remaining forces from Helmsdale, ending the village's twelve year occupation. The dwarves then found themselves in constant conflict with a group of bandits and former Zhengyian servants known as the Thunkers , leading them to announce a hefty bounty on the outlaws.</p>
<p>Around the same time, the dwarves quickly developed a surprisingly good relationship with the half-orcs of Palischuk following their refounding of that city.</p>
