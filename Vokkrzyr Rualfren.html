<p>Vokkrzyr Rualfren was a cleric of Vhaeraun .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He was the leader of the drow settlement in Ultoksamrin , which made him the leader of the Vault of Cloaked Midnight . Originally, the temple was built by drow escapees from the drow city of Guallidurth . The settlement experienced an influx of drow refugees when the surface city of Allsihwann was destroyed by the combined forces of surface elves and Tethyr .</p>
<p>Despite this background, Vokkrzyr Rualfren advocated cooperation with surface elves in their fight against Lolth and her priestesses, in this case against the temple city of Guallidurth . While his invitation and willingness for such cooperation was widely known, it wasn't known how much success he had with recruitment efforts.</p>
