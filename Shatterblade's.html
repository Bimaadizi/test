<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Shatterblade’s was a one-story festhall of fair condition.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>

<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The food and drink at Shatterblade's was of good quality, though patrons were advised to be prepared for the possibility of a brawl, given the rowdy clientele. Prices were high, reflecting the quality of the offerings. The festhall also offered the company of professional escorts , and its staff, seasoned by experience, quickly learned to anticipate impending conflicts and discreetly retreat to private rooms as tensions rose.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Shatterblade's was owned by Rhaunaguth , a former buccaneer and mercenary leader. Named for the mithral shield that Rhaunaguth famously wields in battle, the establishment was primarily a meeting place for his sellsword associates. At any given time, a minimum of ten of Rhaunaguth's mercenaries could be found here. These chainmail -clad fighters were armed with long swords , light crossbows , and daggers .</p>
