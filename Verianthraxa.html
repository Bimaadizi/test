<p>Verianthraxa was a blue dracolich that laired in Anauroch along with her mate Malygris for a time during the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Namirrha of the Cult of the Dragon dispatched Verianthraxa and Malygris to assault the Citadel of the Raven in retaliation for Zhentarim raids on cult holdings in Sembia . Malygris' Queen undead form was destroyed, as the Zhent forces were well-prepared for the draconic assault. In the years that followed, Malygris entered into a state of depression and took no interest in anything until meeting otherworldy beings that were resistant to his tremendous power.</p>
