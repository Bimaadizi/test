<p>Sheenra Duth was a Harper active around 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Sheenra loved her life and always had a contagious smile on her face. She was able to remember thousands of minute details during her normal walk.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sheenra was born in Athkatla in Amn and lived a normal childhood until her family was caught in a business intrigue; a rival of her father ended up killing her parents and taking Sheenra as a slave. Luckily, she managed to escape and in revenge robbed the man's shop and burned his home.</p>
<p>Sheenra later left Amn with no objective in mind but during the journey was intrigued by a traveling minstrel and followed him. Thanks to this man, a Harper agent, Sheenra arrived at the Twilight Hall in Berdusk , where she blossomed into an able Harper thief and musician. She volunteered for every mission, whether difficult, dangerous, or delicate, until Cylyria Dragonbreast assigned an easy one to Sheenra: she had to infiltrate a caravan with two fellow Harpers in order to deliver a message. Instead, Sheenra seduced the caravan merchant and stole from him a document. It was found that the man was a Zhentarim agent and Sheenra had stolen a list of Zhent agents.</p>
