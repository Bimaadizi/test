<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bruno was a muscled half-orc with a greenish-brown hide. His large frame was clad in chainmail armor . He was a friendly enough fellow, but monosyllabic and somewhat dim.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Bruno attended the same school as the person who would become the Hero of Neverwinter . He studied thieving, trapping, and lock-picking under Ketta , the instructor in charge of the school's rogues, spies, and thieves.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the Wailing Death struck the city of Neverwinter in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Bruno resided and trained in the Neverwinter Academy, honing his knavish skills. However, his graduation was not to be—Bruno's life was cut short in the attack on the Academy that left most of its staff and students dead and the school itself put to the torch.</p>
