<p>Prince Hamukai was a wizard -prince and the ruler of Azumar , a small city in the Netherese survivor-state of Anauria . He famously safeguarded one of the much sought after Nether Scrolls , a duty he upheld for many centuries in a state of near-death after the fall of his city and kingdom.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The prince had a magical sapphire embedded into his hand, one that granted him access to the hidden Vault of Stars beneath the Mastaba in Azumar.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Hamukai was considered by his people to be a selfless and dutiful ruler.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He was interred with a platinum death mask and a copy of his personal memoirs.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Hamukai was watched over by the Sapphire Sentinel , a unique stone golem crafted by the loyal Netherese wizards known as the Consortium of Three . The two communication by means of a sign language developed by the prince himself. The Sentinel retained remained connected to the prince, even for centuries following their seperation, and wanted nothing more than to return to his side.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When he was still a young man, Prince Hamukai took on the mantle as protector of the Azumar Nether Scroll . At some point, the blue dragon Zikzorishka learned of the scrolls location and appeared before the city's Mastaba to seize it for herself. While the Sapphire Sentinel kept Zikzorishka—nearly getting destroyed in the process—Hamukai placed a magical shield around the Mastaba's subterranean Vault of Stars. This barrier could only be opened by the sapphire placed within his hand or by the one embedded within the chest of the Sentinel. By the time Hamukai and the Nether Scroll were secured within the vault, both he and Zikzorishka believed the Sentinel and its namesake sapphire were destroyed.</p>
<p>Prince Hamukai directed his royal wizards to cast upon him a spell that would preserve his life energy in a form of stasis, one that would last for millennium if needed. He was interred within a sarcophagus along with the Nether Scroll inside the Vault of Stars in order to keep it safe from Zikzorishka and anyone else that desired it. If the prince's sarcophagus were opened, his body would rapidly age all the years it had been in stasis in mere moments. Only certain powerful magic could be used to reverse this effect.</p>
<p>His body and the Nether Scroll remained undisturbed within the Vault of Stars as of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR .</p>
