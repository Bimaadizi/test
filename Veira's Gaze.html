<p>Veira's Gaze was a small fishing skiff from the town of Targos in Icewind Dale , active in the late 13 th â€“early 14 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Veira's Gaze only surviving part was its carved and painted wooden prow. It was a figure of a woman gazing ahead of the ship.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some years before the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , Veira's Gaze belonged to the fisher and sailor named Donovan , whose beloved Veira was the boat's namesake. One day, after driving too much before sailing, by some accords, Donovan and Veira's Gaze both perished in a storm over Maer Dualdon . Distraught over the sailor's death, Veira threw herself to the bottom of a cliff and became restless ghost , waiting for her lost love. Many years later, Veira's Gaze's remnants were washed ashore, and its carved prow was displayed in the The Salty Dog Tavern as late as 1312 DR.</p>
<p>Some stories claimed that a group of heroes from Targos delivered the painted prow back to the weeping ghost, granting her piece, shortly after a fateful goblin attack on the Ten-Towns.</p>
