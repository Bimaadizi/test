<h2>History</h2>
<p>Eled was a cruel mercenary who gladly fought for any evil creature that could afford his services. Eventually, he gained infamy for his fearsome power. One of the mercenary's clients was a group of maedar and medusae who paid him with a powerful enchanted granite bludgeon: the Flail of Mae . Eled the Desecrator wielded the weapon with a frightening efficiency until the end of his days, many years before the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR .</p>
