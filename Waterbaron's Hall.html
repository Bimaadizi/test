<p>The Waterbaron's Hall was a palace used by the eponymous ruler of Yartar . It served as their personal residence and the site where they held open court.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It was located in the center of Yartar, near the central marketplace and several prominent establishments. The Fishyard was situated just in front of its entrance.</p>
<h2>Exterior</h2>
<p>A number of lion statues, carved from stone, decorated the exterior of the Waterbaron's Hall. These were in fact elaborately decorated stocks used to hold prisoners in between their punishments.</p>
<p>Unlike the rest of the city, which was traditionally kept dark at night, the outside of the Waterbaron's Hall was illuminated with a number of torches.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The palace itself featured a number of columns that held up its overhanging, gable style roof. The chambers within were quite spacious, carrying the voices of anyone inside.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Its interior was decorated with marble sculptures and fine tapestries.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Beyond the Waterbaron, a number of Yartarran merchants were granted residence within the palace.</p>
<p>It also served as a feasting hall, on occasions when the Waterbaron hosted influential guests. As of the late 15 th century DR , individuals who worked alongside the Lords' Alliance were readily welcome within the Waterbaron's Hall.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The Waterbaron's Hall was protected by a ward that prevented anyone within from having their blood shed. As such, most of those within wielded maces or some form of magic .</p>
