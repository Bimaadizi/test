<p>The House of Knowledge was a celestial plane in the World Tree cosmology model and an Astral dominion in the World Axis cosmology model. In the Great Wheel cosmology it was the divine realm of Oghma on the Outlands . The realm had a strong connection to the magic of true names .</p>
<p>Oghma's library held an original copy of Gargauth 's journal from his time as emissary for the Lords of the Nine . Cyric perused this journal to find a spell that would let him see through all divine barriers and deceptions to aid in finding Kelemvor 's soul.</p>
