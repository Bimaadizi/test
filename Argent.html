<h2>History</h2>

<p>Some time before the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Aun Argent saved his niece Caelar from damnation when she inadvertently opened a portal to the Nine Hells by reading from the Tome of the Nine .</p>
<p>As it turned out, Caelar became the first member of the Argent family to exhibit noticeable traits of their aasimar lineage.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Caelar led a crusade to march on Dragonspear Castle with the goal of rescuing her uncle from the clutches of Belhifet in Avernus .</p>
