<p>The winter fey were a loosely organized faction of fey associated with winter, that is, "deadly cold, biting ice, and blinding snow".</p>
<p>The Prince of Frost was widely considered to be the most powerful of the winter fey, able to bend any spirit of winter to his will, though he was not truly their ruler: much of the time, the winter fey cleaved to their own schemes. However, when they gathered at the Court of Stars , they gathered under the Prince's banner, and the various lords and archfey amongst them would typically gather when he called for war. Additionally, only the winter fey were comfortable in the Vale of Long Night .</p>
<p>At times, when the Prince of Frost called the lords of winter together, they were called the Winter Court.</p>
<p>Another archfey of the winter fey was Koliada the Winter Witch. The icelings , small winter fey that often served various more powerful winter fey as servants and spies, were rumored to serve her even when their apparent loyalties were elsewhere.</p>
