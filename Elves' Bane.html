<p>The girdle known as Elves' Bane was a magical item that protected its wearer from piercing weapons such as daggers or arrows shot from a bow .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This large belt was worn by the infamous highwayman Pandar , of Scardale . He often ran afoul of the elves of Cormanthor , while hiding throughout the forest constantly one step ahead of their chase. While the girdle protected Pandar from the elves volleys of arrows, he was no match for a pit-trap, which served as his home during the last days of his life before he starved to death.</p>
<p>Some time later the girdle came into the possession of a dwarf named Unshey , who in turn had it stolen away from her by an ogre who had a very particular taste for belts and girdles.</p>
