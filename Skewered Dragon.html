<p>The Skewered Dragon was a tavern in Waterdeep circa the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR . The clientele was primarily made up of dock workers that were suspicious of strangers.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This establishment was on an alley that ran between Net Street and Fillet Lane in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep , just around the corner and a few doors down from the Old Xoblob Shop .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Skewered Dragon was in very poor shape. Both front windows were broken and the roof groaned under the weight of a ship's anchor that punctured it.</p>
