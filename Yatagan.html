<p>Sheikh Yatagan was the leader of the Shremala tribe of Bedine during the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The old sheikh had the visage of a wise elder, as shown by his wrinkled face and the fact he had no remaining teeth.</p>
<p>He dressed in vibrant colors that stood in stark contracts to the drab abas worn by the sheikhs of other Bedine tribes, along with the heavy furs worn by the Shremala tribe.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Yatagan and the Shremala were among the Bedine tribes that banded together to drive the Zhentarim from their desert in the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR . In the final battle at Orofin , Yatagan played along with the ruse that the sorceress Ruha was "leading" the charge against the Zhent army while under the effects of magical invisibility, while in fact she had assumed the likeness of the Harper agent Lander , in order to hide the fact he had been assassinated.</p>
