<p>Mikaal Dannihyr was a human male and the head of the Dannihyr mercantile family in Eshpurta , which gave him a seat on the Shield Council as of early 1370 DR, the Year of the Tankard . . Mikaal was the aging grandson of Rhinnom Dannihyr , the Iltarch (chief intelligence officer) of Amn, whom most of the family believed to be dead. The Dannihyr family was in a weak position because of honor debts to the Vymmar family, which held deeds to half the Dannihyr clan's holdings.</p>
