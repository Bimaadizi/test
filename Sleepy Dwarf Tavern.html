<p>The Sleepy Dwarf Tavern was a seedy eatery and tavern in the Temple District of Ravens Bluff in the midâ€“to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Cresno China Shoppe stood next-door to the Sleepy Dwarf Tavern in the Swordspoint neighborhood of Ravens Bluff. The tavern was located at the intersection of three alleyways between Rhabie Promenade and Hawk Passage .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The bar featured horrendous decor and the drinks they offered were quite distasteful. Even worse than what the Dwarf had to offer were the patrons who chose to spend their time within.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Hammer of the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , the street in front of Cresno China Shoppe and the Sleepy Dwarf Tavern erupted in violence. Clergy of Cyric , the Mad God, clashed in a vicious battle with priests of Bane . To make matters worse, Banites were joined by devotees of Iyachtu Xvim halfway through. The battle resumed with numerous civilian casualties and massive property damage for both Cresno China Shoppe and the Sleepy Dwarf. Only one combatant was found still alive by the Ravens Bluff's guardsmen. One notable individual who was severely injured in the skirmish was Meegan , a bouncer of the Sleepy Dwarf Tavern who aided the guard in stopping the street-side war. The incident was reported by Silva Sinderan in that month's Ravens Bluff Trumpeter broadsheet .</p>
<p>Another attack happened in front of the Sleepy Dwarf Tavern in Eleasis of the same year when the city of Ravens Bluff became a target for the dreaded tanar'ri . Civilians left the tavern and cut through a nearby alleyway where some unknown force summoned tanar'ri that massacred the group, claiming the lives of five civilians. The fiends, in turn, attracted the attention of nearby city patrol that ended up dispatching the planar beings.</p>
