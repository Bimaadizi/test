<p>Alamaqu was a tent city in the Plain of Horses of northwestern Kara-Tur . It was the home of the T'aghur tribe.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Situated in the central Chigidi Mountains , the city lay in a valley surrounded by high peaks that formed a defensive barrier. Nearby stood Mount Juqan . A road from Alamaqu ran westward and linked it to the other cities of the Plain of Horses.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Alamaqu was actually little more than a vast campsite containing thousands of tents, collectively as big and as populous as an average city elsewhere. These tents were the distinctive white ger favored by the T'aghurs, arrayed in long lines along paths wide enough ox - and horse -drawn carts. Each was erected over a shallow pit dug into the earth. In the winter, the T'aghurs packed up their tents and drove their sheep herds to greener fields, leaving Alamaqu nearly empty.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>As well as the mountains themselves, Alamaqu was protected by a stone wall some 20 feet (6.1 meters) high. While the T'aghurs were away in winter, a small garrison remained behind to watch over the campsite.</p>
<p>Circa Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) , a force of 300 elephants was also kept ready for war at Alamaqu. These were the result of the T'aghur triumvirate's decision to adopt elephants as a cavalry, but they proved to be too slow and too willful for Plainsmen warfare. Regardless, the triumvirate obstinately refused to abandon the idea.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around Shou Year 2592 (1342 DR) , T'aghur rebels at Alamaqu were planning to depose the tribe's ruling triumvirate, when the traveling lama Torgoja P'a arrived and, in only days, persuaded the rebel leaders to give up their plan.</p>
