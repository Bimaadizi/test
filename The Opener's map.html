<p>The Opener's map was the most important project of the Magister Sarndaen Dalabar , an exhaustive map of the portals of Faerûn . After his death, Azuth and Mystra split the map into pieces and spread them across Faerûn.</p>
<h2>Description and Powers</h2>
<p>The map resembled a mere stone floor, but those who looked closely could see a map of Toril graven into the stone. When a tile was touched, the positions of the gates known to Sarndaen Dalabar were highlighted with twinkling red motes, each of which marked the precise location of a terminus. If a living being touched those points of red light, an arc of red radiance pointed to the other terminus of the gate . Were someone to put a part of their bodies across this arc, they'd receive visions of what was around the terminus; by running a hand in both directions, they could see where both ends of the gate led.</p>
<p>After 1066 DR , the tiles were separated by the gods Mystra and Azuth and spread across the world, as they considered even incomplete, the map concentrated too much power. The separated tiles could still generate arcs if their red motes were touched, but the arcs were static, and terminated where they would be if the map was whole; though one could still see both ends by running their hands, discovering the positions involved some reasoning and guesswork.</p>
<p>The map also included detailed instructions for the operation of the gates .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sarndaen Dalabar had originally created his map in a feast hall within a castle in the Ice Mountains , keeping most of it covered with furniture and beastskin rugs while not in use. After his death, though, it was split in pieces by the efforts of Azuth and Mystra, who scattered the pieces. In a few occassions, adventurers had managed to connect two adjacent tiles since, but no one had managed to assemble all of it since.</p>
