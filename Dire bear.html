<p>A dire bear was a huge version of the typical bear .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Most dire bears were 12 feet (3.7 meters) long and weighed as much as 8,000 pounds (3.6 metric tons). While resembling bears, they also had bony brow ridges and extra-long claws, with a more feral aspect and cold piercing eyes.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Dire bears ripped at opponents with their claws, grabbing hold of them, and they could also bite. When the prey was grabbed, the massive bear would maul the creature with its ursine strength.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Dire bears normally did not attack other creatures that did not bother them. However, they were aggressive in defending a food source or a kill. They were omnivorous, but would tear apart anything if they thought it had food inside. Dire bears were wild beasts , though, and would feast on human flesh as readily as any other game animal.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Encountered alone or in pairs, they lived in small groups or preferred to be alone.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Many giants were known to train dire bears to act as guards or pets, such as hill giants and ettins .</p>
<p>The demon lord Baphomet was known to sometimes have awakened dire bears serving him.</p>
