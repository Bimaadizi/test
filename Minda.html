<p>Minda was a young noblewoman from Cormyr circa 1357 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1357 DR, tipsy Minda was unwittingly instrumental in the assassination attempt on Giogioni Wyvernspur 's life during the wedding reception between Gaylyn Wyvernspur and Frefford Wyvernspur . She continuously asked and goaded Giogi to do his famous imitation of King Azoun Obarskyr IV . He did. It triggered the assassin's magical azure bonds, forcing her to attack the source of Azoun's voice.</p>
<p>Even though Giogi survived, one of the guests, Darol , received a slash to his face, which made Minda swoon over him, to Giogi's disappointment as he spent all day trying to impress the young lady. Darol later was given permission to accompany Minda's carriage back to Suzail.</p>
