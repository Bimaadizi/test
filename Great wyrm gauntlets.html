<p>The great wyrm gauntlets were a pair of unique enchanted gauntlets created by a dragon disciple named Redshadow sometime before 1374 DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The great wyrm gauntlets possessed powerful +6 enchantments that made every punch a deadly danger and guided the wearer's fists toward their desired target. Additionally, each punch blazed with the fire that burned the target. However, the gauntlets' magic came at a price of significantly reduced dexterity.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These legendary gauntlets were stitched together out of a great wyrm 's hide by a dragon disciple only known as Redshadow, many years before the late 14 th century DR . Some stories claimed that the dragon disciple was the great wyrm's child. Sages agreed that the fearsome battle between the two took place in the skies over the Dragonsfire Mountains . Redshadow wore the great wyrm gauntlets until her death, after which the magic items disappeared from history for a long while.</p>
<p>In of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the great wyrm gauntlets were sold by a drow merchant who did business in the Undergate , Westgate 's unsavory underbelly.</p>
