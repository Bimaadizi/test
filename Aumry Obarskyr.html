<p>Aumry Obarskyr was the Lord of Shadowdale from 1300 DR to 1339 DR . His last name, Obarskyr of Cormyr , was known only to a few individuals. He was the husband of Syluné Silverhand . He ruled Shadowdale peacefully until his assassination by Zhentarim agents in 1339 DR. His assassins were captured and killed by Jyordhan , but Jyordhan was himself a hidden Zhentarim agent.</p>
<p>Aumry was laid to rest in Aumry's Tomb , on Watcher's Knoll in Shadowdale . His wife eventually died in 1356 DR .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Aumry had a magical staff and cloak . The staff was stolen from his tomb by Lashan Aumersair of Scardale in 1344 DR and was lost when Lashan's empire fell. It was later replaced by Esvele Greycastle in 1374 DR in an attempt to destroy Syluné, who at that time was a spectral harpist and would remain so only as long as her husband's possessions remained uninterred.</p>
