<p>The Cave of the Elements was a peculiar cavern near the drow city of Sschindylryn that was home to a great many elemental creatures.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Cave of the Elements was a large chamber that was taller than it was wide, with pools of water at the base and irregular formations of stone reaching up to the ceiling. A perilous network of bridge-like stone let an explorer traverse the vertical extent of the chamber (assuming they survived the elementals), finding hidden side passages leading elsewhere in the Underdark . At the very top of the cavern, guarded by a small army of stony elementals was a massive daycrystal formation, lighting the top of the chamber in a warm orange glow as if the sun itself was peeking into the Underdark.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The cavern was located not far from the Boneyard and a portal to Sschindylryn.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The cavern was home to a large number of elemental beings, including earth , water , and air elementals , as well as salamanders . They all co-existed in a strange harmony, not struggling against each other but instead helping and defending each other. This combined threat made the cavern extremely dangerous to interlopers.</p>
