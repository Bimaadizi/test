<p>The Citadel of the Banner Raised Anew was a temple of Arvoreen in eastern Amn , dedicated to the protection and welfare of halflings .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The temple lay on the crossing of the South Road over the Hyrzashyr river, opposite the village of Zinner . It was part of the old lands of Meiritin , and was just north of the Tejarn Hills .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Citadel was built on the site of an ancient ruined Arvoreenan structure from the days of Meiritin. The new structure was built by the halfling Brenth Stoutshield , who sought to organize an autonomous halfling domain within Amn in the style of old Meiritin. From this temple, the High Marshal took in hin parishioners from the surrounding lands, formed an expansive militia, and worked alongside Major Tharundar Olehm of Hillfort Torbold to protect the region from monsters and raiders. During the Sothillisian War of 1370 DR , High Marshal Brenth and most of the militia left in order to fight alongside the Council Army against the marauding hill giants and goblins , leaving only a small reserve to defend the Citadel itself</p>
