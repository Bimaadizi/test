<p>Oldyle Belark was the patriarch of the Belark family in Delzimmer until at least the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR . The Belarks were one of four powerful merchant families that were the de facto rulers of Delzimmer.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Oldyle was an extremely corpulent man with bowed legs and long arms. His hair was black in his youth and he had the family nose, a large, hooked beak of flesh. Because the livery of their personal security force was mostly colored crimson, Oldyle and his family rarely wore this color, except possibly for weddings and funerals.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Oldyle was aggressive and snobbish, but could put his pride temporarily aside and act like a dim-witted brute (the impression that outsiders frequently took on first sight) in order to glean information about possible allies or adversaries in business.</p>
