<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sklorn was a large rocky outcropping rising from the Sea of Swords – an island of fissured granite with temperate woods growing among the cracks. Sklorn had rock-basin pools of freshwater collected from melted snow and summer fogs as well as several freshwater springs. The island's center was a rocky elevation with freshwater streams cascading off it towards the island's harbors. Sklorn was 8 miles (13 kilometers) diagonally in length with its southern shores being approximately 8 miles (13 kilometers) long.</p>
<p>The southern shores had two anchorages on both sides of the island's main harbor, sometimes called Sklorn's Rest . The second harbor was located at the center of the western shores. Many shipwrecks littered the island's shoreline – the legacy of Sklorn being used by pirates and buccaneers.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Sklorn was located to the west of Thelve, with two sister islands to the northwest – the middle Unglur and the westernmost island of Raerest . Together Sklorn, Unglur, and Raerest were known as the Crab Reach , or simply the Reach among the locals. The shortest distance between Sklorn's easternmost cape and Thelve was 10 miles (16 kilometers) of the Sea of Swords, and 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) separated it from Unglur.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>Sklorn was home to a significant population of seabirds – gray coasters , that stained the island's southern shore rocks with white streaks of guano underneath their colony habitats. Several species of predatory sea creatures could also be found on the island. All three islands of the Crab Reach were abundant with crab . Among other occasional inhabitants were castaways and some roaming monsters.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Historically, Sklorn had long been used by pirates. The island's main harbor – Sklorn's Rest, was believed to had been named after a sailor.
