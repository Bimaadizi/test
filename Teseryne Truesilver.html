<h2>Home</h2>
<p>Teseryne had lived all her life in the Delimbiyr Vale. By the early 1370s DR, she made her home in a cottage on the north bank of the Delimbiyr River , near Loudwater . It was nestled amongst flower gardens that produced a dazzling range of colors and shapes when in full bloom. A cobblestone path wended through them to door. Bird houses, a half-dozen at least, were placed around the gardens, with some mounted on poles, others mounted in the trees, and others hanging from the cottage's eaves.</p>

<p>She knew much local lore and history of the Delimbiyr Vale and Eaerlann . She would not receive visitors after nightfall, but during the day would invite them in for a repast such as shortbread and spearmint tea while they spoke.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the spring of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , a group of adventurers visited Teseryne at her cottage when seeking information about the Half-Elven Renegades . A neighbor, Eldrin Whisperbark , a victim of the Renegades, had sent them to her thinking she knew lots of useful things. She did, relating what she knew of the Renegades and their leader, "Princess" Tianna Skyflower .</p>
<p>In the middle of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Teseryne told tales of the adventurers' quests and events in Loudwater and the Vale in the past year. One of these she learned from the grig prince Feythrin .</p>
