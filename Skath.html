<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was a loyal henchman of Speaker Naerth Maxildanarr , leader of Targos.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Skath was in his role when Auril the Frostmaiden descended onto Icewind Dale in the Year of Dwarvenkind Reborn, 1488 DR , spreading her unending winter, and Naerth, together with the Speakers of Bryn Shander and Easthaven , took the drastic step of holding monthly lotteries to determine who of the inhabitants was to be sacrificed to the Cold Goddess and cast out into the freezing tundra to die of exposure.</p>
<p>Finally, in the winter of the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , this period of strife culminated in an attack by a rampaging chardalyn dragon , a creature forged out of black ice by Xardorok Sunblight and unleashed to destroy each of the Ten Towns. Naerth's personal spy network alerted him to the attacks on the other towns, giving Skath time to muster the militia and ready siege weaponry, though invisible duergar sabotaged these defense and murdered townsfolk. Fortunately, the creature was defeated by a group of adventurers and the efforts of the militias of the Ten Towns.</p>
