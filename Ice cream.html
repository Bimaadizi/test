<p>Ice cream was an uncommon variety of frozen dairy dish served as a last kiss of a meal or a smallbite dessert.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Typically made with eggs , sugar , and cream , making ice cream was a long process. Egg whites were whipped with sugar until they achieved a stiff-peak consistency, then the same was done with cream, and the two mixtures were carefully folded into each other and left to freeze.</p>
<p>Some cooks who were blessed with the Gift could use such spells as ray of frost to chill and freeze the ice cream mixture into the cold dessert form. Others could use ice-boxes or freezing temperatures and snow outside.</p>
