<p>Mitcher Trollslayer was one of the regulars of the Hidden Lady in Suzail circa 1357 DR.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Mitcher Trollslayer was friendly with most regulars and workers of the Hidden Lady.</p>
<p>Phocius Green mentioned Mitcher Trollslayer's name to king Azoun Obarskyr IV , Vangerdahast Aeiulvana , and Giogioni Wyvernspur , when the innkeeper was questioned about the mysterious swordswoman and supposed assassin.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1357 DR Mitcher was leaving the Hidden Lady after the last call and stumbled over Alias , a mysterious woman with an azure shimmering tattoo on her arm. She was unconscious and laid out on the inn's front stoop. Mitcher thought her to be one of the Witches of Rashemen due to obviously magic tattoos. It did not stop the innkeeper Phocius Green from giving the woman one of the rooms to sleep off whatever drinking binge he assumed Alias was on.</p>
