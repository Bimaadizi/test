<p>Evil was the antithesis of good and a trait of some creatures, inhabitants, and deities .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>How "evil" was defined was up to the societies that interpreted it. As such, evil appeared in many different shapes and forms, and those who committed evil acts often did not see the harm or destruction they actually caused. Evil beings, those who were generally unconcerned with chaos or law were known as neutral evil . Evil beings that were concerned with using the laws of society to benefit themselves were known as "lawful evil", and those who disregarded the law and revelled in chaos or bloodlust were known as "chaotic evil".</p>
<p>By and large, evil creatures were associated with killing, hurting, and oppressing others. Some deliberately sought to be evil in order to please a wicked deity or patron , whilst others were naturally compassionless.</p>
<p>Some evil beings supported rigid caste structures and slavery, as long as it benefited them. Due to the beliefs of many evil inhabitants, good beings would often try and seek them out, either to convince them of their evil ways, or outright kill them.</p>
