<p>Decatons ( pronounced : /ˈ d ɛ k ɑː t ɑː n z / DEK-a-tanz ) were the lowest rank of hierarch modrons .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Decatons were shaped like spheres atop stubby legs, with ten tentacles and four eyes evenly spaced around the sphere. At the top of the sphere was a mouth.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like all hierarch modrons, decatons had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of clairaudience , clairvoyance , command , dimension door , teleport without error , and wall of force spells at will. Additionally, they were able to cure injuries and cure diseases from all modrons within 144 ft (43.9 m) and 12 ft (3.7 m), respectively. They could also heal and remove paralysis by physically touching another modron.</p>
<p>They could communicate telepathically with anyone in a 44 miles (71,000 meters) radius. and could see in complete darkness from up to 44 feet (13 meters) away.</p>
<p>Decatons were able to fly by generating a lifting gas that allowed it to be lighter than the surrounding air. They typically only did so whenever they were commanding large numbers of base modrons and needed to get an overview of their situation.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>If forced into combat, a decaton used its tentacles in melee combat. They also heavily relied on their spellcasting abilities.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>There were only 100 decatons in modron society. They could communicate with other decatons and with nonatons , and relayed their orders to pentadrones . One decaton was in charge of each of the 64 sectors of their realm in Mechanus , and the remaining 36 decatons served in the modron armies. They functioned as caretakers of the modrons under their command, looking after their physical welfare.</p>
<p>Decatons were always created as the result of pentadrones being upgraded to take the place of destroyed or further promoted decatons.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around −346 DR Netherese archmage and explorer Lady Polaris came upon Mechanus and the modrons. She summoned several decatons to her home to guard her treasures, but was stymied as they kept disappearing after several days. She had more success with the pentadrones she focused on next.</p>
