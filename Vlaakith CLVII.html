<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The last queen of the githyanki, Vlaakith CLVII, died after ascending the throne without giving birth to an heir, but returned as a lich, thus remaining the ruler of the githyanki for over a thousand years. Her home, Castle Susurrus , was located in the Queen's District of the githyanki capital city, Tu'narath , which was built on the corpse of a deceased power known only as " The One in the Void ".</p>
<p>The basis of the Vlaakith line's claim on power was a supposed blood relationship with Gith.</p>
<p>One of the queen's jobs was to decide whether every visitor to Tu'narath should be granted a visa or not. However, Vlaakith CLVII delegated this duty of hers to lesser generals.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Vlaakith CLVII had a number of red dragons under her service. These red dragons feared her so much that they would continue to serve her even if the scepter of Ephelomon would be destroyed.</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Vlaakith was the name of many rulers of the githyanki race after the disappearance of Gith , the rebel leader that united them against the illithids . The original holder, Vlaakith I helped seal the pact between the red dragons and the githyanki. All subsequent queens of the githyanki were named after her.</p>
<p>Vlaakith CLVII stood out among the Vlaakiths for becoming a lich. Her undying reign and her success at getting rid of those who could challenge her were why she managed to retain her throne for longer than any other Vlaakith.</p>
<p>After centuries of undeath , she grew mad. She came up with an idea to become a deity and started to install a priest caste in githyanki society. She also sent loyal lieutenants to quell any unrest that might arise. These were done to gradually prepare for her ascension and encourage the githyanki to worship her as a deity. An inquisitor caste to hunt down people whom she wanted gone also existed. However, many githyanki viewed her as a mad tyrant who would cause their people's destruction or enslavement at her hands even before she reached her goal.</p>
<p>In the late 15th century DR, Vlaakith dispatched a force of githyanki warriors under the leadership of Inquisitor W'wargaz to Toril in search of the Astral Prism , an artefact of immense power that had been stolen by worshippers of Shar .</p>
