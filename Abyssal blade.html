<p>Due to the rarity of materials used in forging these grim blades, they were only wielded by the strongest and the most important demons of the Abyss, such as balor generals, namely, Kazz'Temmet . One such blade ended up in the Moonsea region after traveling the planes for a thousand years. That Abyssal blade remained its strong connection to the plane of its origin even past the events of the Order of the Crippled Fang crisis of 1373 DR .</p>
