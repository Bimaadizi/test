<p>Dexon was a Vaasan warrior that joined several of his countrymen on an expedition to the city of Evereska in the late 14 th century DR . There they reunited with Melegaunt Tanthul , an ally of their ancestors who led them to a series of events that would reshape the face of Faerûn for decades to follow.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was a swarthy and burly man, with a countenance accentuated by a distinguishing moustache. His appearance (and disposition) was akin to that of a good-natured bear .</p>
<p>During one of his battles while fighting along the elves of Evereska, Dexon's leg was badly injured, withered to the point where it could hardly bear his weight.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Dexon was both a steadfast warrior as well as a kind and caring man. While he and his men were always ready for battle, Dexon often found himself a bit flummoxed when confronted with matters of love.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Like his fellow Vaasans that made the expedition to the Sharn Wall beneath Evereska, Dexon was the proud owner of a darksword . His blade had the unique quirk of "talking in its sleep", presumably when sheathed.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The burly Vaasan warrior developed a loving and passionate romance with one of his party's elven hosts, Keya Nihmedu . After a few short months together they fell in love, and Dexon became very protective of Keya, even if he had trouble expressing himself.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dexon joined the expedition from Vaasa to Evereska in the Western Heartlands in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR . After traveling to Evereska in the Greycloak Hills , Dexon chose to to remain within the elven city. During his travels he developed feelings for Keya Nihmedu of the Vale Guard .</p>
<p>In mid– Mirtul of that year, the archmage Khelben Arunsun finally broke through the phaerimm -led siege of Evereska and began coordinating the city's defense with the Hill Elders . Dexon and his men served as the Blackstaff 's personal escorts for a time. When the time came that Khelben's company leave to fight the phaerimm, Dexon was saddened to part ways from Keya.</p>
<p>The pair reunited in battle when the phaerimm attacked the Vine Vale on Mirtul 20 . During the fighting, Keya made use of Dexon's darksword and felt no ill effects—a sensation of cold that left the blade unwieldable after a short time—and realized they had been bonded as family. Keya was expectant with Dexon's child. As Dexon suffered a grievous wound shortly thereafter, the couple were granted leave to rest within Evereska's still-standing walls.</p>
