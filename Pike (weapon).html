<p>Awl pikes , also simply known as pikes , were a member of the spear family of polearms .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These weapons were built similarly to longspears , having long shafts that varied in length at 16​ to ​22 feet (4.9​ to ​6.7 meters), but had a comparatively superior construction and balance that made them far more usable by smaller races like gnomes and halflings . These shafts tended to be made of strong woods, such as those of an ash tree, with their non-bladed ends capped in silver and their grips wrapped in cloth in order to prevent splitting.</p>
<p>The bladed head of a pike was typically leaf- or lozenge- shaped. These heads often had two tongues of steel , which were nailed down the sides of a pike's shaft in order to prevent the spear head from getting hacked off.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>Like many spears, pikes were designed for the purpose of delivering thrusting and piercing attacks from a distance. The great length of the pike, coupled with its widespread deployment with infantry known as "pikemen", also helped to keep enemy forces at a distance.</p>
