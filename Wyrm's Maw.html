<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Wyrm's Maw was created using hide, bone, heavy gray-white scales, skull, and jaws of Frostmaw. The helmet completely covered the face of the individual who wore in.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Once per day, the wearer could unleash a deadly roaring blast cold.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Wyrm's Maw was created after Frostmaw, a great white wyrm, so fierce and huge it could rival a true white dragon , was defeated and slain by the hero ranger named Kellem Longeyes of the Ten-Towns . The helmet was imbued with Frostmaw's deadly frigid breath. Many years after Wyrm's Maw's creation, Kellem Longeyes embarked on the one last hunt into the spires of the Spine of the World and never returned.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , Kellem's helmet was recovered from a nest of two white dragons and their white wyrms in the River Caves just south of the Spine of the World, from whence the Black Raven River began its run south across the Cold Marshes .</p>
