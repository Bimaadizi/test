<p>Nagarr , sometimes marked as Kagarra on maps, also named Yacla around the 9th century DR , was a fortified village found in the Vilhon Reach between Sespech and the Lake of Steam . In 1370 DR , it was a protectorate of Ankhapur .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The village sat on the southwest bank of the Nagawater upstream from where the Nagaflow began. It was on the fringes of the land between the Nagawater and the Winterwood called the Serpents' Holding . The Ankh Road connected Nagarr with Ankhapur to the southwest, paved since 1370 DR.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The mayor in 1370 DR was Torgis Hatchetson . In reality, the true influences were the merchants along Nagarr's docks and Janol I .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nagarr was a simple farming-fishing village, but by 1370 DR with the rise of Janol I of Ankhapur, major reconstruction and increase in population as a trade transit point gradually expanded it to accommodate trade.</p>
<p>The most common stories were told in the inns and taverns of Nagarr all involved the monstrous and mysterious naga . The locals had no idea that separate species of good, evil and neutral naga all lived in the area (which Orswin failed to do with his attempts) and the consensus was the only good naga was a dead naga.</p>
<h2>Armed forces</h2>
<p>As of 1370 DR, 375 members of Ankhpur's Watch were permanently loaned to the Mayor of Nagarr.</p>
