<p>Ripper was a wolf and the pet of the goblinoid leader, Klarg , around 1491 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ripper was said to be mangy, but was loyal to Klarg. The bugbear relied on his pet wolf for protection, but both were willing to fight. Klarg would not, however, fight without his pet, and would flee from combat if Ripper was killed.</p>
