<p>The Gray Ghosts were the only true thieves' guild of Gracklstugh . They were filled with derro and duergar outcasts and a few escaped slaves.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Gray Ghosts had a special interest in a ruined black obelisk they had found that they believed contained "unimaginable power", so they tried to recollect all the fragments of the obelisk and rebuild it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1486 DR , the Gray Ghosts stole a red dragon egg intended to replace Themberchaud as the Wyrmsmith of Gracklstugh from the Keepers of the Flame . The Keepers used all their strength to eradicate the thieves and captured and executed the Gray Ghosts leader. The guild was then led by a triumvirate of renegade derro savantsâ€” Uskvil and the twin sisters Aliinka and Zubriska .</p>
