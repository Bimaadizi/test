<p>Sohei ( pronounced : / s oʊ h ɛ / soh-heh ), sometimes called yamabushi "mountain warrior", were special warrior-priests that could be found in Kara-Tur and the Hordelands . In Shou Lung , they were called no-sheng ( pronounced : / n oʊ ʃ ɛ ŋ / noh-sheng ) Sohei were similar to paladins found in Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Sohei usually served as guardians for monasteries . While they were clerics similar to shugenja , they focused more on their military training. They structured their lives around religious principles but not as strictly as a shugenja. These principles included vegetarianism and discipline. Sohei were often dedicated to their duties to the point of fanaticism. An individual from any caste might train to be a sohei. Upon entering the service of a monastery, they shed all family or clan connections. A sohei's status was based on the power and importance of the monastery, and honor was very important to a sohei, similar to ninjas . Most sohei were human or hengeyokai , although some monastaries had accepted korobokuru into their orders.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>To defend their monasteries or temples from attacks, Sohei trained extensively with weapons as well as martial arts. They also possessed limited magical powers. Sohei can access their ki abilities to go into a berserker-like frenzy. Sohei were able to cast some divine spells, but did not have access to as many divine spells that a shugenja had. A sohei who was dismissed from their order lost the ability to cast divine spells.</p>
