<p>The Spirit of the Sun was a spirit of Wa associated with the sun . He was one of the Eight Million Gods . [ speculation ]</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Wa Year 1663 (1245 DR) , the Spirit of the Sun gave Matasuuri Shogoro , the shogun of Wa, three treasures in recognition of his work to unite Wa. These were a sword, a mirror, and a pearl , all glowing with the sun's light.</p>
<p>However, when Matasuuri Nagahide became shogun in Wa Year 1754 (1336 DR) , he got the idea that the gifts were unlucky, and gave them away: the sword to the Shining Temple of Bishamon , the mirror to the businessman Oshichiro Yoto of Iiso , and the pearl to Yorifusa Ti , daimyo of Hotomori . Then, in Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR) , the Spirit of the Sun visited Nagahide in his dreams, learned he no longer had the treasures, and was offended. The shogun's tairo hired adventurers to retrieve the treasures.</p>
