<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR, Kya Mordrayn and Marjon's father, Pelendralaar, led the Cult of the Dragon to occupy the ruined city of Myth Drannor . The cultists intended on using raw magical power of the pool of radiance under the Castle Cormanthor to infect the cities in the Moonsea with the pool's corrupting soul-consuming magic. During that period of time, Marjon occupied one of the Castle Cormanthor's subterranean officers' chambers. His room was quite spartan, only holding a metal-flame bed and a metal chair. The rest of the room's furniture was incinerated by its moody occupant, judging by the abundant ash.</p>
<p>In the Cult's hierarchy, Marjon reported directly to its higher-ups, namely Ellis commanded the half-dragon's daily activities and Shamoor directed his special tasks and missions.</p>
<p>Soon after the resurrection of the corrupted pools , two independent groups of heroes found themselves opposing the cult. One of the groups managed to infiltrate Castle Cormanthor and destroy Pelendralaar's phylactery , allowing the other group, the Veiled Ones , to slay Marjon's father and defeat Kya Mordrayn. Marjon was very likely to have survived the events of Myth Drannor.</p>
