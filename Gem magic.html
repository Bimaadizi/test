<p>Gem magic , also called gem-magic or gemstone magic , was an application of magic involving the use of gemstones . There were two broad types of gem magic: the first type involved attuning gemstones to store or affix spells for subsequent use, and the second type involved tapping into the natural magical properties of different types of gemstones.</p>
<h2>Gem Attunement</h2>
<p>This form of gem magic was meant to affix a spell to a gemstone for later use. The gem could only be activated—and the spell released—based on some trigger specified by the creator at the time of the gem’s attunement. The trigger could be that the gem was touched, that a certain amount of time had passed since its attunement, or that a certain manner of creature was present or came near the gem. An attuned gem could detect and trigger based on a creature’s type, alignment , race, or appearance, but generally could not detect the relative skillsets or strength of a creature. Regardless of the prespecified trigger, the crafter of the attuned gem could freely handle the stone or even cause the spell to release prematurely if so desired.</p>
<p>These gems could also be attached to other items, in which case their triggering could cause the stored spell to affect or empower that item. When affixed to doors or other large objects, the gems could serve as traps . When affixed to weapons or other pieces of equipment, the gems could provide instant enhancements to the item or protections to its wielder. A common application was to create a gem ward which provided emergency protective spells in response to a nearby enemy. Common wards were empowered with protection from evil , feather fall , protection from arrows , or stoneskin .</p>
<p>A practitioner of this kind of gem magic generally had to be trained in both gemcutting and arcane spellcasting. To attune a gem, the creator had to spend at least an hour casting the spell with all necessary material components . More powerful spells required bigger and more valuable gems, with the weakest spells needing a stone with a value of at least 50 gold pieces while the most powerful spells could require a gem valued at 450 gold pieces. Alternatively, wizards with the proper ability to modify their spells could produce a similar effect simply by casting the spell into a malacon gemstone, while clerics could store healing spells in topaz gemstones to be released upon contact with an injury.</p>
<p>As a general rule, gems could only be attuned with arcane spells, although some deities were known to grant their mystic wanderers the power to attune gems with divine magic as well.</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>This form of gem magic was practiced in ancient Netheril , where so-called "gem masters" created attuned gems and would sometimes embed them as traps in tombs and the like.</p>
<p>By the 14 th century DR , the secrets of the creation of attuned gems had been lost. When such gems were recovered from ancient treasure vaults, they would often release their stored spells unexpectedly before crumbling to dust in treasure hunters’ hands. Although the practice of attuning gems had been forgotten, a somewhat similar practice of using gems to create focal stones endured as part of the practice of enchanting an item . Practitioners used the focal stone spell to affix enchantments and spells into gemstones to be subsequently transferred into a magic item using the dweomerflow spell. However, these focal stones could also release their spells if crushed or otherwise destroyed.</p>
<p>In the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, the practice of attuning gems and creating gem wards had been rediscovered, and some gods were known to grant the power of gem attunement to their more free-spirited followers.</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, the deep gnomes practiced a similar form of magic in which they created spell gems that could store a single spell and then release that spell at the command of the gem's wielder. These items were known to be used by the Stoneheart Enclave of Blingdenstone , and the means behind their creation was a closely guarded secret.</p>
<h2>Natural Gem Magic</h2>
<p>Many gems—whether precious , semi-precious , or otherwise—were known to have potent magical abilities, either on their own or when used properly in the casting of spells or creation of magic items, potions , etc. The innate magical properties of gemstones were sometimes unclear, and with only a few exceptions, it was not possible to access a gem's natural magic without the proper knowledge. Other times, gems could be worn by an individual to gain certain magical benefits, although this often required the gem to maintain contact with the wearer's skin. Furthermore, harnessing natural gem magic was known to be imprecise, and would often yield "flawed" results—in much the same ways that gemstones themselves could be flawed.</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>The ancient Netherese used chrysoberyl to make audio recordings of everything from warnings to instructions to motivational speeches. They also made use of azurite charms to protect themselves from burns in their kitchens (a practice that was also held by folk from Halruaa , Myth Drannor , and Calimshan ).</p>
<p>Many folk across Faerûn were known to make use of innate gem magic. Folk from as far and wide as Waterdeep , Sembia , and Chessenta would wear tremair stones sown into their clothes, offering them protection from curses . In south Faerûn , coral was used for its healing properties. Calishite and Sembian furniture was sometimes trapped by inlaying boakhar , which could shoot bursts of fire. In Telflamm and Turmish , rituals were performed with aquamarine to duplicate other gemstones. In Rashemen , the wychlaran used Laeral's tears to bolster the toughness of their berserkers , while their enemies, the Red Wizards of Thay , experimented with thuparlial to try to empower their fire-based spells. In Impiltur in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, Pelathyon Hawkryn came to be known for wielding "moonstone magic" in which he substituted moonstone for most of his material components.</p>
<p>Other gems were wrongly believed to have properties that they did not, such as amber , rogue stone , soapstone , and Tiger eye agate . Some gems from Kara-Tur were believed to be quite magically potent—namely Shou Lung amethysts , emeralds , and topazes —however Faerûnian scholars were unable to ascertain their true properties.</p>
<p>A form of this gem magic was practiced in ancient Mulhorand , where the god-kings were the first to create mighty gemstone golems which leveraged the natural magics of rubies , emeralds , and diamonds to imbue the constructs with potent abilities. However, the secrets of their creation were lost as the god-kings dwindled, and were only rediscovered in the 1360s DR by Zulkir Aznar Thrul of the Red Wizards, however his understanding of gem magic was incomplete, When he built an army of golems to attack on Rashemen, they proved to be unpredictable and often required a dozen wizards to control. Ultimately, his whole army had broken away from his control by 1372 DR .</p>
