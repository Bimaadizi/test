<p>The apocalypse bindings was a unique belt crafted by a long-forgotten legendary leathersmith in the Domains of Dread , long before the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When worn, the apocalypse bindings greatly boosted the wearer's vitality and combat prowess, both offensive and defensive. It gave the wearer a battle advantage and allowed them to strike with armor-penetrating attacks. When the belt was used in tandem with two other items in the set, apocalypse choker and apocalypse dagger , the damage dealt to one's enemies with the dagger produced painful bleeding cuts that slowly sapped their vitality.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The apocalypse magic items set's history was lost to antiquity, even the name of the belt's legendary craftsman. The stories claimed that the magic belt could, maybe, possibly protect the wearer from being pulled through planar gates into non-benevolent worlds. Others just said that the belt was created to keep the wearer's pants up.</p>
