<p>The wood man , also called the forest spirit or the Wood Man , was the strongest of all nature spirts of Rashemen .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wood man was a towering figure at 50 ft (15 m) tall, resembling a massive humanoid made of wood. The wood man's feet were rooted and its hands were club-like. Branches and leaves of different tree species sprouted throughout its body.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Though terrifying in combat, the wood man also boosted the morale of any Rashemaar troops fighting along side it. Its great hands could easily crush smaller foes in combat.</p>
<p>The wood man was resistant to most forms of magic . It was even more resistant to any magic cast by a Red Wizard . Additionally, the wood man was completely immune to all fire and electricity-based attacks.</p>
<p>As the wood man was literally rooted into Rasheman, they regenerated from physical harm at an alarming rate, making them very difficult to destroy.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>A single wood man was usually present in Rasheman, though rumor held that several could be summoned under dire circumstances. It remained unclear how these creatures were summoned. Some believed the wychlaran were capable of this task, while others believed it fell to vremyonni . Other Rashemaar believed the wood man was a servant of the gods. And some forest spirits did in fact act as servants of the nature deity Rillifane Rallathil .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The wood man appeared to defend Rasheman against foreign invaders. A wood man was believed to have been destroyed by the Grand Army of the Tuigan during their invasion in 1359 DR – 1360 DR . Thayan bombards were reported to have damaged a wood man so severely during one of their first incursions that it was forced to retreat. Despite this, the wood man appeared a year later to answer the call of Liriel Baenre , crushing drow -summoned zombies as it entered the battle.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>The wood man wreaked havoc as it passed through the land, rerouting rivers, destroying hills, etc. However, all damage to the land healed and reverted to its previous state within a matter of days.</p>
