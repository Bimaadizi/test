<h2>History</h2>
<p>While the eruption of volcanoes in Thaymount during the Spellplague of 1385 DR caused desolation across the entire nation, the weather and climate of Eltabbar had largely been normalized and protected by magical means as of the year 1479 DR . The finite number of agricultural farms within the tharch supported the living population of Thay during the latter half of the 15 th century.</p>
