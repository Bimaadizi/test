<p>Octal was the local specialty alcoholic drink from the Maztican city of Ulatos in Payit , later New Amn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The drink was brewed using the pulp from a species of Maztican cactus called Sand Mother . Unlike drinks imported from Faerûn , such as whiskey and rum , octal was much less potent. It was usually kept in jugs or hollowed out and dried gourds .</p>
<p>A single mug of Octal could be priced at up to 20 cocoa beans – the main currency of the pre-New Amn Maztica. This drink was considered a holy drink by the worshipers of Azul as he was the patron god of octal. The goddess Kiltzi was said to look fondly on certain aspects of human affection, such as wild nights of octal-fuelled revelry and love.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Payit and its city of Ulatos and later Helmsport of New Amn was a major producer of octal. The production of the intoxicating libation was taken over by the colonies and Cordell 's Golden Legion following the fall of Payit and Nexal.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
