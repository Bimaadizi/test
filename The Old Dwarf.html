<p>The Old Dwarf was a long-standing tavern in the capital city of Cormyr , Suzail .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Old Dwarf stood on Suzail's Promenade , across the avenue from Cormyr's Royal Court . The old tavern had deep wine cellars, one of which hid passage to Castle Obarskyr . Each of the oaken wine casks was illuminated by its own candle . A heavy iron spell-warded gate separated the cells from the passageways to the castle.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Old Dwarf existed as early as several human generations before the 14 th century DR , and it was believed that the taver's wine cellars were dug out by its original owner the "Old Dwarf" himself. It was also believed that Azoun Obarskyr IV , his father, and an unknown number of Obarskyrs before them, used the passage between the castle and the tavern during their numerous amorous excursions.</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Old Dwarf's entrance was illuminated by a hanging lantern above it.</p>
