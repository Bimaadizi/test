<p>Jerumillis was one of the Blades of the Old Man as of 1374 DR . He was once a cutthroat from the Sword Coast . On the night of Tarsakh 25 , he was on guard duty at the Fortress of the Old Man together with two others. He spotted a faint green glow; meeting up with Galban and Bennig , they pursued the light into the Gallery of Stone Faces , where Jerumillis was slain without ever seeing his attacker, Berun .</p>
