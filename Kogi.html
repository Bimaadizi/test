<p>Kogi was a Winter Sect monk in Nakamaru around 1357 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Kogi was a good instructor at the monastery. Often, he secretly went out with his friend Bupposo .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kogi and his friend Bupposo wanted to play a prank against the Tsuyoi-no-kami monks: they paid Ichi the korobokuru yakuza to find a girl who could seduce the rival monks. So the young maiden O-Shino , acting under the orders of the monks, tempted Anchin and Kaian .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Kogi liked his work as an instructor. Kogi was an easy-going guy, friendly to all who met him. He knew that his irresistible taste for mischief made him a failure as a monk and he lamented that it would keep him from reaching spiritual perfection but it also made his life more interesting. He did not care for his spirit heritage.</p>
