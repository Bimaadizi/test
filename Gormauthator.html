<p>Gormauthator was a skeleton red dragon in 1375 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gormauthator was one of the dragons that assaulted Shadowdale in 1356 DR during a flight of dragons; Syluné Silverhand fought the three more powerful dragons, among those Gormauthator, at the Tower of Ashaba and destroyed the dragons at the price of her own life. In 1375 DR in a effort to terrify the population, the cleric of Shar Esvele Greycastle raised Gormauthator as a skeleton to guard Sylune's tomb.</p>
