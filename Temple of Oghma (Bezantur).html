<p>The Temple of Oghma in Bezantur , Thay was a place of worship dedicated to Oghma .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple was located in south-central Bezantur, the so-called "City of a Thousand Temples." Appropriately, it was surrounded by other temples, notably the Temple of Malar , the Temple of Shar , the Temple of Lliira , the Temple of Helm , and the Temple of Umberlee .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>It was a circular, white marble building with a colonnade.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The temple was primarily a library, boasting an extensive collection on topics ranging from history and religion to philosophy and science.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The local congregation was so small that it almost did not warrant a formal place of worship, however the church of Oghma maintained the temple in order to grow their knowledge about Thayan society.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Many supposed that the library contained tomes on the topics of magic and spellcasting, topics banned by the Red Wizards of Thay . If these rumors were ever proven to be true, the Red Wizards would have immediately sacked the temple and killed all inhabitants.</p>
