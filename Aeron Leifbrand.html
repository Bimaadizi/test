<p>Aeron Leifbrand was a Cormyrean Wizard of War who served in the town of Eveningstar in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Aeron was a human man with a shaven bald head and stubbly chin.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime around the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar , Aeron was recovering in the Eveningstar War Hospital when Peron Uthe arrived for treatment. Peron was infected with a strange disease passed from the druid Halsaime , which turned him into a red musk zombie and began spreading to the other patients. Aeron was among those infected, and eventually transformed into a zombie as well before being destroyed when the hospital was cleansed. A sample from his body was able to be used by head priest Jaskyr Hurim to create an inoculation, allowing Peron Uthe to be safely destroyed.</p>
