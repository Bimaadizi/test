<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, Branimern was studying ancient Nar ruins in the Great Dale . As of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , she ventured into the ruins of Val Murthag in order to recover whatever information possible about ancient, demonic Nar rituals. She subsequently discovered a way to transform herself into a cambion , and proceeded to surround herself with minions ranging from fiends to corrupted fey , including fomorians and cyclopses .</p>
<p>After finishing her research in the Great Dale, Branimern led her minions to Mount Nar where she hoped to unearth the earliest secrets of the Nars from the ruins of Jastaath , where it was said the first Nars to parley with demons had lived. Around or before the Year of the Silent Tear, 1439 DR , she and her entourage destroyed the dracolich Kryonar who had long laired on the mountain, and then proceeded to construct a stronghold on the western face of the peak amidst the ruins of Jastaath Castle. Her towering lair was visible all the way from Bildoobaris .</p>
<p>By the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , she was continuing to pursue the secrets of the Nars, and had grand plans to conquer Narfell, the Great Dale, Rashemen , and even Thay .</p>
