<p>Eustachia Churlgo was one of many children of Millie Churlgo who produced the infamous Churlgo Cheese in the Eastern Farmlands of Daggerford circa 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Eustachia Churlgo was a young and hard-working halfling woman with medium-length brown hair.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Eustachia was one of the best farm workers among the many Churlgo children. She worked efficiently and took her job seriously if not frantically. She often worked outside along with her disgruntled brother Porto Churlgo , tending to the farm's cows , arguably the most important task as they were essential to cheese -making. She often reacted with annoyance and snarky comments to her brother's constant complaints and desires to live large in a big city like Waterdeep .</p>
<p>Eustachia, along with other Churlgos moved their farm from the Dalelands to Daggerford following a nasty extortion business with the Iron Throne . In 1372 DR, the farm where they resided was still noticeably un-lived-in, but the cheese-making business was in full swing.</p>
