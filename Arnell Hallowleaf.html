<p>Arnell Hallowleaf was an elven werewolf who devoted to himself to the goddess Selûne in the mid-to-late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He had the ability to transform into the form of a wolf , a power not entirely uncommon among the Selûnite faithful.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Arnell was married to the human woman Emmeline . Together they had a single daughter, Jenevelle , who was taken from Selûne's grace by the faithful of Shar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the Year of the Elves' Weeping, 1462 DR , Jenevelle was left alone in the woods at night and directed to find her way home, as was tradition among the Selûnite faithful's soon-to-be-adult children. Unfortunately, a group of Sharran priestesses led by Mother Superior Viconia De Vir plotted to abduct the child during the rite and utilize her for their own ends. Arnell Hallowleaf learned of the Sharrans' plan, took on his wolf form and tried to rescue his daughter. He was too late however, and Viconia and Shar's servants abducted Jenevelle.</p>
<p>The couple were taken to the same Sharran church as their daughter, called Cloister of Sombre Embrace . During their imprisonment, they saw their daughter Jenevelle, now renamed Shadowheart, and other Sharran neophytes being brainwashed into worshiping the Lady of Loss. They were made the subjects of their own daughter's training in torture and they had to watch their daughter's memory and personality being erased over and over. The Sharrans also cursed their daughter with a bond of torment between the parents and her. Despite being imprisoned and tortured for years, the couple still hoped to see their daughter to become herself again.</p>
<p>They were intended to be the last stage of Shadowheart's full conversion to the Lady of Loss: to kill her own parents in veneration of Shar. She was intended to become Shar's new Chosen and reform the order of Dark Justiciars from the Gauntlet of Shar .</p>
<p>As the Absolute crisis shook Baldur's Gate , Shadowheart may have discovered her true nature, which led her to confront the dark goddess. Shadowheart could choose to abandon Shar for Selûne and give her long-suffering parents and herself freedom by ending Emmeline's and Arnell's lives, or choose to save her parents and bravely bear the curse.</p>
