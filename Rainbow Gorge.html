<p>Rainbow Gorge was a cleft in the Rauvin Mountains that was generally believed to be the beginning of the River Rauvin . It made up the southern exit from Dead Orc Pass .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Rainbow Gorge was located on the south side of the central Rauvin Mountains, between Mount Gaeram and Faerang's Doom . It connected to Dead Orc Pass to create a pass through the mountains.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Rainbow Gorge was the exit of the River Rauvin from the Rauvinheart caverns , through which the river passed under the Rauvin Mountains from the Cold Wood . Geothermal heat forced the waters out in geysers before emerging in waterfalls out of the cliff face at the gorge. The mist in the air created a constant rainbow. A steep, ancient trail followed the east side of the gorge along Faerang's Doom until it reached Dead Orc Pass.</p>
