<p>The Great Waterfall was a large underground waterfall near the drow city of Sschindylryn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The waterfall was remarkably large and provided as much clear, pure water as anyone could want. It poured out a torrent from the top of the cavern, forming a pool at the bottom of the cavern that drained away without flooding the rest of the chamber.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The cavern containing the Great Waterfall was located on the edge of Sschindylryn's influence and poorly controlled, also beneath the view of the great red dragon Micahrastir . Other nearby sites included Nessaleesa's Garden , Tranquility Grove , and Agathea's hut . The waterflow originated in the Storm Horns before passing into the Underdark , then drained away elsewhere below.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The waterfall was traditionally fought over between the drow of Sschindylryn and a militant group of yuan-ti including Kressp and Massrak . During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar , the yuan-ti managed to take control of the entire area, securing the water supply for themselves.</p>
