<p>Gyudd was a master brewer in Skullport .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>

<h2>Possessions</h2>

He also owned a pair of enchanted hob-nailed boots , passed down to him by his great-grandfather on the man's deathbed, that functioned similarly to a pair of boots of the north . He rarely walked around heavily armed, instead preferring to have a dagger or knife tucked away in his belt for emergencies.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Gyudd ran Gyudd's Distillery . In his free time, he was always in a bar drinking.</p>
<h2>Relationship</h2>
<p>Guydd was the last member of the Melairkyn dwarves and a direct descendant of King Melair IV .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gyudd arrived in Skullport circa 1310 DR and soon started his brewery and distillery. However, some time after the Melairkyn ghosts started to appear, Gyudd tried to silence them by becoming more and more drunk.</p>
<p>In 1375 DR Gyudd's dreams became too strong after the earthquake following the Halaster 's death. He sold his business and hired an adventuring party to accompany him to the Belkram's Fall citadel inside Undermountain .</p>
<p>He was still in operation as successful brewer during the early 1490s DR .</p>
