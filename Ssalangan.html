<p>Ssalangan was a white dragon who worked under Sammaster during the Rage of Dragons of 1373 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>While Ssalangan recognized that the Rage of Dragons was overwhelming, he was still reluctant and unhappy about the idea that transformation into a dracolich would be needed to overcome it. He was somewhat absent-minded, at least compared to his immediate superior.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Ssalangan aided Zethrindor in the conquest of Sossal , both under Iyraclea and after her death.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On Eleint 2 , 1373 DR, Ssalangan was part of Zethrindor's forces as they assaulted Ironspring Grove . Unfortunately, he arrived too late to his superior's fight to be of any assistance. Instead, the dracolich sent him to chase transformed druids.</p>
<p>On Marpenoth 21 – 27 , Ssalangan was with Zethrindor's forces when they assaulted the elven citadel on Novularond containing a portal to the dracorage mythal . He was ordered to search for the adventurers accompanying Karasendrieth in the aftermath of the fighting.</p>
<p>Ssalangan was arguing with Chuth on Nightal 6 about who should become a dracolich first. It took Sammaster's involvement to break off their fight. The rage broke shortly after, but Ssalangan waited for two days before venting his displeasure over the local cell of the Cult of the Dragon , considering himself to have been deceived by them.</p>
