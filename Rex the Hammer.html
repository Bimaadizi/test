<p>Rex the Hammer was a fighter adventurer in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Rex was once an adventuring fighter and the leader and member of the Fine Fellows , an adventuring company from Daggerford .</p>
<p>In 1492 DR , Rex and his fellows descended into Undermountain. There, in the Dungeon Level after Kelim became lost, Halleth Garke accused Rex and his two remaining companions of withholding treasures from him, so Rex and the other two beat Halleth to death and threw his body into a pit. However, Halleth rose as a revenant in order to have vengeance. Unfortunately, he was unable to get out of the pit without help. If Halleth managed to have his vengeance, he finally died for good.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rex proceeded with exploring in the Arcane Chambers and found himself in a battle against a vicious mezzoloth and two nothics .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Rex believed that his party could replicate the exploits of Durnan and his friends but their evil tendencies caused a loss of cohesion that doomed the group. On the surface, Rex was amiable and confident but tried always to bully others in order to command them.</p>
