<p>Barrels were a commonplace liquid container used in Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Barrels were used to store liquids, most commonly alcoholic beverages such as ale , cider , beer , wine , and other spirits, but also clean water. A barrel was a roughly cylindrical container made from wooden staves held in place by metal hoops. The bottom was permanently secured, while the top was usually removable but could be made permanent and cut with a plughole.</p>
<p>Water barrel reservoirs could be set up for easy access for hand-washing and tool-cleaning in workshops.</p>
