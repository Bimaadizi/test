<p>Dog pepper was a diversionary tool used by thieves to distract dogs , similar to aniseed though comparatively less effective.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Dog pepper came in small packets, holding enough to cover a 10 ft (3 m) cube. When dropped on the ground behind them, a fleeing thief could potentially cover-up their scent, though they had better results when throwing dog pepper up into the air. Alternatively, a thief could throw dog pepper directly into the face of a hound to drive them hysterical for an hour.</p>
