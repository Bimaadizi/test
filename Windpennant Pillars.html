<h2>History</h2>
<p>Laeral Silverhand , in her guise as Trennan Beldrusk , investigated Auvrarn Labraster starting by his rented lodgings at some point in 1369Â DR ; she uncovered barely any signs of habitation. She fell into a trap on a magically darkened room on the stable, landing herself in an underground passage, which ultimately led to the mansion behind it.</p>
