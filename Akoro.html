<p>The Akoro was a tribe of goliaths that dwelled in the Abbey Mountains for hundreds of years at least.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>They lived atop Mount Akoro , a peak found along the southern side of the range, overlooking the Tortured Land to the south.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The tribe was believed to be active during the Golden Age of ancient Netheril , well into at least the Shadowed Age .</p>
<p>In the Year of Sycophants, −357 DR , the Akoro goliaths joined a motley coalition of forces from the Moonsea North, alongside the gnolls of Frozen Flindyke , the gnomes of Forharn , and men from the realms of Horreb , Barze , and Varm , to combat an evil primordial being from the Elemental Chaos known as Maram of the Great Spear . Under the leadership of three human generals from lands beyond, they emerged victorious and banished the being back to its home plane of existence.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The history of the Akoro was included in the book, Heart of the Mountain , a rather contentious work that detailed the history of goliaths in Faerûn . The author postulated that the Akoro were once men of the Rengarth barbarian tribes who ascended the Columns of the Sky , a range of mountains in the heart of the Netheril (region) , west of the Abbey Mountains , in order to force answers from the gods in which they had lost their faith.</p>
