<p>Ice Spire ogres were a race of ogre inhabiting the Ice Spires , between the Great Glacier , Silver Marches , and Anauroch .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ice Spire ogres on average stood 10 feet (3 meters) tall and weighed around 500​ to ​600 pounds (230​ to ​270 kilograms). They had dirty-gray hair and skin colors varying from yellow to brown-black, while their irise were a surprising purple hue. Tusks protruded from their lower jaw, their chins jutted out, and they had big floppy ears. They stunk worse than regular ogres, describing as being like rotting meat.</p>
<p>Some clothing seen among these ogres included bronze nose rings and headdresses made from the skull and skin of a wolf .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the late 15 th century the frost giant jarl Ryndölg recruited a number of ice spire ogres and sent them out across the land in search of ancient runes of power.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Ice Spire ogres dwelled, for the most part, in an extensive cave and cavern network situated in the highest part of the Ice Spires. The caves were full of a thick, choking mist that rose from subterranean vents in the deepest caves.</p>
<p>A second tribe of Ice Spire ogres made their homes in an icy chasm called the Dour Fissure . This was the only tribe that possessed the Blood Dance ritual ability, a barbarian 's rage which they viewed as divinely inspired.</p>
<h3>Relations</h3>
<p>Among the giants and giant-kin living around the Ice Spires, the Ice Spire ogres were among the lowest in status.</p>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>The ogres of the Ice Spires revered the ogre god Vaprak the Destroyer , but also obeyed Lanaxis , the Twilight Spirit. Those who lived instead in the Dour Fissure followed the demon lord Baphomet .</p>
