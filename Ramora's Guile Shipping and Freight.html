<p>Ramora's Guile Shipping and Freight was a shipping business in the Lower Port of Skullport in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Ramora's Guile Shipping and Freight was a modest one-story building with a basement.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Ramora's Guile Shipping and Freight was known for its selective business practices. It rarely accepted freight from walk-in customers, consistently claiming full capacity. It was in fact a front for small-time smuggling operations, which specialized in attaching contraband to the undersides of vessels using watertight containers. Smuggled goods were securely stored on-site, protected by four trained war dogs and a series of magical and mechanical traps .</p>
<p>As of 1370 DR , Ramora's Guile focused primarily on transporting smokepowder for the Brigadier .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Ramora's Guile Shipping and Freight was owned by Sheila Kells . Despite numerous attempts by the Pirate Tyrant, Misker , to take over her operations, Sheila had thus far managed to resist them, though many believed it was only a matter of time before she was forced to align with his organization.</p>
<p>In support of their arrangement, the Brigadier provided Sheila with an enchanted dagger for personal defense and a small enchanted crystal globe, which she wore on a chain around her neck. Should the globe be shattered, it signaled the Brigadier, who would then arrive fully armed to defend his assets at Ramora's.</p>
