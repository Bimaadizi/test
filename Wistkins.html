While there they investigated the hut of Wistkins, finding it to be cold and abandoned. All they could find within it was a crude map of the Thunder Peaks he had drawn. This map had the village of Volkumburgh marked, as well as the ruins of the College of Rune Magics and the College of Shaping Magics .</p>
