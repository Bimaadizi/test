<p>Jarlmoot was a landmark in Icewind Dale , serving as the former seat of power for the frost giant jarls in the region.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The site comprised seven giant-sized stone thrones, arranged in a circle facing one another. There was one throne for each of the frost giant's jarls, one of which was claimed by Jarl of Jarls, Reggaryarva .</p>
<p>Hidden beneath Reggaryarva's throne was an underground hallway that featured six braziers inscribed with Jotun runes. By lighting each of the runes with its required ingredient, a person could gain access to a grand chest holding the giant's treasure .</p>
<p>The six Jotun runes were dod , fjell , krig , liv , vind , and wyrm .</p>
<p>A poem inscribed upon the wall offered clues on how to correctly lite each of the braziers.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Jarlmoot was located atop a hill, some ways west of the Shaengarne River .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , the frost giant Gromin'gorn traveled to Jarlmoot in order to face the frost giant specters and claim its hidden treasure.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
