<p>Beljurils , also known as fireflashils or fireflashes , were gemstones only known to exist in the Realms and highly prized for their unusual properties. These jewels were found in ancient rock formations, usually in blue claystone. They also occurred in beljuril dragon lairs.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Beljurils were a deep seawater green with a smooth surface, and all known specimens were roughly the size of a human fist approximately 3 to 5 in (8 to 13 cm) in diameter and not quite spherical. These stones were extremely hard to abrade or cut—mere metal tools wore out quickly and had to be replaced often to make any progress. Because of this, when worn for adornment, they were usually worn uncut or split into halves and mounted in claw settings for pectorals or epaulets. Other mundane uses include beljuril shards as decorative lighting, warning beacons, or nightlights for the extremely wealthy. A typical specimen had a base value of 5,000 gp .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>About once every hour (rates varied from stone to stone and did not seem correlated with size or age) a beljuril absorbed an undetectable amount of energy (heat, light, and vibratory) from within a 30 ft (10 m) radius and re-emitted that energy as a flash of light without heat or sound but with a few very mild sparks of electrical discharge. The light produced was easily noticeable when the ambient light was dim (candlelight or lantern light) and in the dark it was dazzling to the eye.</p>
<p>Alchemists , artisans, and sages attempted to harness beljurils as a power source, but none were known to have succeeded. This stone's affinity for electrical energy made it highly desirable as a component in making wands of lightning and other items that cast electricity spells —shards of beljuril affixed to the tip increased the power of the wand or made it harder to resist, depending on the nature of the spell. Likewise, powdered beljuril was used in ink for inscribing such spells and in magical immersions to enchant items that collected or conducted electricity.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Beljurils were considered prized gems among the drow but their use as decoration was limited to important places like a wizards ' tower, temple approaches, or the temples themselves except for the ones of Lolth . For example, temples to Vhaeraun had a ceiling, which was studded with beljurils to look like a starry sky.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>A dwarven legend told around the southwestern region of the Vast asserted the existence of a natural cavern somewhere northwest of High Haspur whose walls, floor, and ceiling were encrusted with thousands of beljurils. The legend was unspecific about how to access the cave or what may have been guarding it, but warned that all who sought the cave vanished entirely or were found dead with a single beljuril stuffed into his or her mouth.</p>
