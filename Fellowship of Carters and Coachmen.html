<p>The Fellowship of Carters and Coachmen was an association of individuals who owned and operated various means of conveyance to earn income within the city of Waterdeep . These included but were not limited to those who drove carriages, carts, and sleighs and who carried litters or pulled rickshaws to transport others throughout the city streets.</p>
<p>Guild members were granted the freedom of inspection by city watchmen , unless under direct order of a magister or City Lord . However, they were not exempt from being searched by the City Guard .</p>
<h2>Membership</h2>
<p>The Waterdhavian representatives of many caravan companies that operated in the North and Western Heartlands held membership within the guild.</p>
<p>Nobles and other wealthy individuals who owned their own carriages, along with skilled individuals who transported their own goods, were not required to keep membership within the guild.</p>
<h3>Costs</h3>
<p>Entrance fees to the guild varied, depending on ownership of the prospective member. Single cart or litter owners were charged 10 gp and those with multiple means of conveyance were charged 25 gp. Guild dues were a monthly fee of 5 sp .</p>
<h2>Uniform</h2>
<p>The guild's livery consisted of navy blue cloaks and long-brimmed caps, both of which were lined with silver.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>For many years, guild members tried to gain a legal monopoly on the transportation of people and goods throughout the city of Waterdeep. These actions were prevented by the Lords during the midâ€“14 th century DR when they explicitly forbade any restrictions on the use or ownership of inter-city conveyances, and the guild gave up in the 1350s DR.</p>
