<p>Fey'ri were not a true elven subrace. They were to elves as tieflings were to humans and tanarukks were to orcs . The fey'ri were the result of interbreeding between sun elves and tanar'ri in an attempt to strengthen the sun elf bloodline.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The fey'ri resembled elves "the way tieflings resemble humans". Some fey'ri were not visibly different to elves at all, while others had fangs, forked tongues, horns, or barbed tails in varying combination. Some had multiple sets of arms and one or more sets of wings.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Fey'ri considered their bloodline to be very important, and prided themselves on being able to trace it back to House Dlardrageth or the daemonfey . This meant that breeding typically only occurred with other fey'ri or, very rarely, elves, but they generally rejected the notion of elven resemblance as offensive.</p>
<p>The fey'ri would generally look negatively upon outsiders, but were respectful towards intelligence, strength, and flexible morals. Even once having made a "friend", a fey'ri would abandon that person immediately if the fey'ri saw that individual as more than a minor annoyance.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Fey'ri had a talent for the use of magic , and some would practice bladesong . Almost all fey'ri had the ability to change shape, which aided in concealing themselves in society. Other abilities varied, including producing flames, draining life, or resisting spells.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Most fey'ri became sorcerers , rogues , or fighters .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Fey'ri sought to reestablish the old elven realms of Cormanthor with themselves at their head.</p>
<p>They have an autarchic way of life, with a strong sense of community.</p>
<p>After the death of Sarya Dlardrageth , most fey'ri considered themselves to be without a leader. As of 1479 DR , however, Lilianviaten claimed to be an older brother of Sarya and the "Last Heir", and claimed to have escaped imprisonment, roaming freely and undiscovered for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Some fey'ri were raised amongst elves, some never knowing their true nature.</p>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>Despite their elven blood, fey'ri did not worship the good gods of the Seldarine, but neither did they follow the tiefling practice of worshiping demons. Instead, one of the elders of the Floshin house had been converted to Ghaunadaur 's cult for centuries, until the majority of the fey'ri worshiped The Elder Eye, a clear sign of their corruption.</p>
<p>The rare neutral fey'ris had proved receptive to Fenmarel Mestarine , the god of banished elves and pariahs. A few fey'ri had begun worshiping him in secrets in the hopes of learning how to survive in Faerun without drawing the ire of their Ghaunadauran family members.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Fey'ri were born from cross-breeding between four nobles houses of sun elves with succubi in order to strengthen their lineage. The fey'ri fought during the Crown Wars .</p>
<p>The first house was the Dlardrageth from Cormanthor which was imprisoned after being discovered by others elves. During their detention, they made an alliance with three minor houses from Siluvanede . The houses released the Dlardrageth in exchange for magical objects, and they also procreated with demons. In the end, they all got magically locked up until three members of the clan got free and destroyed the magical seal.</p>
<p>After that event, Sarya Dlardrageth launched the invasion of Evereska and then of Myth Drannor with thousands of fey'ri, demons, and orcs but were defeated by Seiveril Miritar leading a crusade of volunteers from Evermeet that later turned into a return.</p>
