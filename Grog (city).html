<p>Grog was a small, agricultural city-state in the ancient Netherese Empire .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The settlement sat in the fork of the Zweihaus River and Westview River , upriver of Fluvion and Heip Lake .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The city was founded as an agricultural town in 753 NY (−3106 DR) , early in Netherese history. Little of import occurred there, with its main claim to notoriety being the creation of its local specialty beer , "grog." Though by all accounts a terrible drink, it remained inexplicably popular in Grog, then spread to became popular among Netheril 's sailors who used it as a rust remover and a vile rite of passage for their guild . The recipe eventually spread across Netheril, and the drink became common in all ports throughout the land.</p>
<p>Grog became the enemy of the militant Jannathan holy order, Jannath's Defenders , who they called "murderers who wantonly massacred entrepreneurs." The rangers operated from the Glorifier and developed a fearsome and brutal reputation, though not an entirely deserved one.</p>
<p>Grog continued its quiet pastoral existence until the farmlands around it began to turn to desert after 3400 NY (−459 DR) , and by 3503 NY (−356 DR) it had been abandoned. The only residents were rumored to be the ghosts of those killed while under the influence of the vile grog drink.</p>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR there existed a book detailing the city's history. This book notably alleged a connection between the city-state and the similarly named variety of alcoholic beverages, grog .</p>
