<h2>Geography</h2>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Because of the "blowscree", the city was also known as the City of Dusk. People usually wore dark, hooded cloaks to protect themselves against the "blowscree", making everyone look alike out of doors.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Lylorn was ruled by a high lord, an hereditary title. In 1479 DR , the high lord was Dauna Lorastur .</p>
<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>Marrauk exported salt to other regions in Laerakond and western Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
