<p>Phaen's robe of rags was an ordinary-looking yet enchanted robe that once belonged to Phaen of the Rags in the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Phaen's robe of rags was just that, a robe sewn together of numerous mismatched ragged strips of cloth. Despite being a magic item , it looked like something a beggar from Luskan could wear. On the inside, the robe was lined with bear 's pelt.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Enchantments were weaved into the robe's fabric. It granted the wearer a +2 defensive enchantment and protected them from the normal and magical cold. Phaen's robe of rags was masterfully enchanted, and its magics were virtually undetectable even to most experienced wizards .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , this robe was worn by Phaen of the Rags, an outcast mage from Luskan's Arcane Brotherhood . He eventually joined the Legion of the Chimera that threatened the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale with destruction. In Mirtul of the 1312 DR , Phaen pretended to be a lowly beggar in Targos while spying for the Legion and magically transporting goblin marauders past the city's walls and fortifications. When his allegiance was revealed, Phaen was slain by a band of mercenaries from Targos and the enchanted robes left his possession.</p>
