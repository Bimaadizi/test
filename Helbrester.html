<p>Helbrester was a city somewhere in the Nelanther Isles . It was founded by a group of Netherese arcanists in the Year of Three Seas' Rage, −334 DR and lasted for just over 300 years.</p>
<p>In Year of Wraths, −8 DR , two liches destroyed the city. Using arcane magic, the liches Thakloamur and Mingaudorr razed the city. The ruins of Helbrester were later sacked by the Tethyrian Clan Fyrson and other pirates of the region.</p>
