<p>Giddeon the Believer was a mage philosopher and the creator of the enchanted kinetic spear , who lived sometime in the late 10 th and early 11 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Giddeon was a renowned researcher and philosopher of the natural arcane magic currents who developed a theory that stated that the world had natural "currents" of magical energy, and one could tap into these "currents." According to Giddeon's teachings, once a wizard could understand the "currents," they could use the flow of energy and draw from it via certain spells or focus devices. It was believed that Giddeon the Believer perished in a massive laboratory explosion of the Year of Three Signs, 1010 DR , with only several items surviving. His kinetic spear was one of these items, created to tap into the world's natural magic currents and channel them into explosive force.</p>
