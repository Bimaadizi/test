<p>Joru was a shaman of the Huroola tribe from the jungles of the Malatran Plateau , active in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Joru traveled and battled unarmed. Uncharacteristically for a Huroola, the shaman was was respectful towards warriors of other tribes, as well as his enemies and opponents.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR , the Tribe of the Wise Ones became aware of a looming threat of the evil spider katanga . The Mother of a Thousand Young was swollen with a thousand children ready to overflow the jungles with ravenous spider creatures. In preparation for the birthing, she initiated a ritual that sent deadly poisons into the rivers cascading off the Fire Mountain . Joru was assigned a group of experienced heroes of the Living Jungle despite him being significantly less powerful than other group members. The shaman's band was heading into the spider katanga caverns, past the living quarters, and straight into the most dangerous part of the lair â€“ the nest to face the Mother.</p>
<p>It was unknown if Joru survived the battle, but the Mother of a Thousand Young was defeated, and heroes returned to the Village of the Wise Ones for their reward and facilitated the clean-up and nature's healing.</p>
