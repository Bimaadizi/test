<p>Chelathra was a slave from the Calishite markets that was given to Tyvbolt Arsurath as a gift. He grew obsessed with grafting magic onto her; she eventually turned on him, prompting his downfall.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was beautiful; while she was his assistant, Tyvbolt Arsurath used magic to further heighten her beauty.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She eventually betrayed her master when she sensed the opportunity.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Tyvbolt Arsurath confirmed that she had no ability for magic. However, in response, he decided to instead alter her body, embedding wands in her arms, and make her capable of spitting slaying spells by grafting ever more magic items in her.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>She was gifted to Tyvbolt Arsurath during his tenure as the Magister , sometime between 537 DR and 544 DR . He became obsessed with making her his assistant; she lacked talent for magic, though, and rather than give up, he decided to experiment on her with spells, grafting wands and other magic items on her body. He also used magic to heighten her beauty.</p>
<p>She turned her arsenal on him in 544 DR , when Annath Sunfall attacked Tyvbolt in the aftermath of the Magister's attack on two red dragons. Weakened from the battle, the Magister called on her to slay the challenger, but she attacked him instead. Tyvbolt destroyed her.</p>
