<p>Kazmil-urshula-kelloakizilian , or Urshula , was a black dragon who claimed to be the progenitor of all black dragons in the Bloodstone Lands . He became a dracolich around 1368 DR , with his spirit found in a phylactery concealed in a book of creation , a relic of the Witch-King Zhengyi .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Urshula was already an ancient and powerful wyrm with his own goblin worshipers by the mid–14 th century DR when a party of dwarves awoke him slumbering in a bog near the town of Palischuk in Vaasa , and the dragon proceeded to attack the town, enraged that people had settled on "his" land. This caught the attention of the Witch-King Zhengyi in the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , and the lich began courting the dragon with offers of dracolichdom. When the dragon refused him, Zhengyi took matters into his own hands, leading a small army of would be dragonslayers to Urshula's lair, and then arranging for his death and sealing his soul within the phylactery.</p>
<p>Years later, in 1368 DR , Urshula's soul was used to power one of Zhengyi's relics , a book of creation, and reformed in a large chamber in the lower parts of a Castle Perilous replica.</p>
<p>He was fought by a party comprising Artemis Entreri , Jarlaxle , Athrogate , and a few others, eventually losing the battle. Urshula's half-decomposed dragon body was mostly destroyed by a magical dragon pendant, designed to be hung over doorways as a defensive ward, owned by Artemis Entreri (gifted to him by Jarlaxle). Once more, Urshula's spirit became trapped in the dragon phylactery, one of two (similarly working) phylacteries in Jarlaxle's possession.</p>
