<p>The Eveningstar bridge was a large stone bridge in the Cormyrean town of Eveningstar .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The bridge crossed the Starwater River with the eastâ€“west High Road on the east side of Eveningstar leading towards Arabel .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The great stone bridge had three arches and two gatehouses atop it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The bridge was built during the reign of King Azoun V at great expense, connecting the High Road across the Starwater and replacing the older, smaller bridge.</p>
<p>During the Darkening of the mid-1480s DR , the village came under attack by drow forces, though they focused on the southern and western sides of the village and not the bridge. Not long after, a company of orcs from the Storm Horns (ostensibly controlled by Archwizard Amskar of Thultanthar ) suddenly raided Eveningstar as well, briefly overwhelming the eastern defenses of the bridge before the garrisoned Purple Dragons pushed them back and secured both ends. They then reinforced the eastern barricades while sending forces into the Storm Horns to determine the source of the attack.</p>
