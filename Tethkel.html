<p>Tethkel was a series of deep mines, accompanied by a small town, within the northern Sunrise Mountains in the country of Rashemen . They were a great source of mineral wealth, rich with iron ore.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The mines held a small community of Rashemi miners who were considered among the most undisciplined, wild people of their land. They boasted that their group consumed the greatest amount of jhuild within the entire nation.</p>
<p>The miners exported their goods to the settlements of Urling and Immilmar where they were forged into tools, weapons and other goods.</p>
<p>Kobolds were known to dig passageways into the mine shafts to conduct raids upon the miners and their operation. Goblin wolf -riders and winter wolves from the Endless Wastes regularly stalked the outskirts of the town looking for an easy meal.</p>
