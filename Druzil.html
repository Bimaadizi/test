<p>Druzil was an imp from the Lower Planes .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Druzil was two feet tall, had a canine face with floppy ears, his mouth was equipped with a set of pointed, yellow teeth, and he often moved his forked tongue in a lizard-like fashion. He had bat-like wings and a sharp barbed tail dripping with poison. The imp had taloned claws for fingers and skinny legs.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Apart from being able to sting and poison an individual with his tail, Druzil also had the innate ability to become invisible at will, though any offensive action by himself would reveal him again. He could also change himself into a different creatureâ€”once he became a centipede in order to escape an attack by Cadderly Bonaduce .</p>
<p>The imp could use a drop of his blood to enact a curse, thus dispelling or at least weakening goodly magic.</p>
<p>Druzil could release little bolts of energy, much like small, green bolts of lightning.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Druzil was summoned several times to Toril 's plane.</p>
<p>He was the acquaintance of Aballister Bonaduce and introduced the magician to the recipe of the Chaos Curse . Druzil stayed with Aballister to see the Curse perform its hideous work on the clerics of the Edificant Library . The imp was a short-time associate of the cleric Barjin when he brought the Chaos Curse to the Edificant Library.</p>
<p>The magician Dorigen also had the doubtful honor of being associated with Druzil while supervising the assault of Ragnor 's troops on the elves of Shilmista Forest.</p>
<p>It was he who manipulated Kierkan Rufo in a manner that led to him becoming a vampire .</p>
<p>He was also used by Cadderly to retrieve information about the balor Errtu (whom he later served) for Drizzt Do'Urden .</p>
