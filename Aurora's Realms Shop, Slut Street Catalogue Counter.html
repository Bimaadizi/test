<p>Aurora's Realms Shop, Slut Street Catalogue Counter was an outlet of the Aurora's Emporium retail chain in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep in the midâ€“14 th century DR . It was one of six such outlets in the city.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It was located on Zastrow Street (formerly Slut Street), next door to the Purple Palace festhall (with a narrow side alley separating them) and two doors up from the Old Xoblob Shop .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was located in a three-story-high tenement building of unremarkable appearance.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>This shop sold the various items found in Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue . Opening hours were dawn to dusk.</p>
<p>The nearby Old Xoblob Shop was not a competitor for the catalogue counter, as the curio shop sold everything Aurora's did not, could not, or would not.</p>
<p>In the late 1400s DR, the store was a good place to get rumors, especially on local shipping at the docks.</p>
