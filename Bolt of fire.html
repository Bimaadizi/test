<p>Bolts of fire were a type of common enchanted crossbow ammunition.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These magic bolts were individually enchanted to burst into scorching fire once fired. This magical effect was fairly similar to bolts doused in flammable oil and lit to fire. As such, bolts of fire pierced and scorched their targets. A stronger variation of these bolts was imbued with a +1 enchantment that guided the missiles to their targets.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR , bolts of fire were often used along the Sword Coast region , as well as the Moonsea . Circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , bolts of fire were among arms and armaments smuggled by the pirates to supply a growing orc and tanarukka armies of Gorgomorz , the Daggerford 's Devil , who was plotting to destroy the city with the aid from the Zhentarim .</p>
