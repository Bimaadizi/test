<p>Returning pikes were enchanted throwing polearms , found in the Western Heartlands of Faerûn in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Returning pikes were imbued with the returning dwarvish enchantment of Clan Ticklebeard that pulled the pike out and ruched it back to the thrower's hands. Additionally, they possessed a +1 enchantment that guided the weapon toward its target and increased its damage, making it magical.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , returning pikes were known for the Crazy Wilbur battle technique invented by the Ticklebeards. Pikes and other returning weapons were swallowed by the enemies and then called back, making a gory mess in the process. One such magic pike was in the hands of Grat the Trader, a goblin of the Cult of the Absolute . The weapon itself was looted from nearby locales targeted by the cult in 1492 DR.</p>
