<p>Impractical Magic was a collection of several volumes dedicated to the phenomenon of wild magic , penned by the wizard Bigby from the world of Oerth sometime in or before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<h3>Volume I</h3>
<p>The Volume I included a conversation between Bigby and his accomplished comrade and sage Otiluke . The tome described the unpredictable effects of the wild magic that could turn the caster's underpants into butterflies and shoes into curry -flavored jelly , when they attempted to cast the fly spell , but despite such hilarious effects, Bigby thought the wild magic's origins were mysterious and harrowing. Bigby theorized that the wild magic might be coming from a sorcerer 's genes.</p>
<h3>Volume II</h3>
<p>The second volume covered the strange topic of the dead magic zones . According to the author, the areas of dead magic first appeared during the Time of Troubles , when the magic of Toril was fractured and reassembled. This calamity left scars where magic was scourged, completely cut off from Mystra 's Weave . Any creature within such an area lost all magical abilities and effects.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Copies of Impractical Magic could be found in the city of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR, including within the thematic bedroom called " Elminster 's Library" in the Sharess' Caress brothel, and among many books dedicated to the Art on the shelves of Sorcerous Sundries in the Lower City .</p>
