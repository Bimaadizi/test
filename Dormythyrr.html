<p>Dormythyrr was the Steward of the Duchy of Brandiar in the Kingdom of Damara in the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Dormythyrr was a brave, handsome, and very wise individual, despite his youth. He always pondered his decisions, being guided by common sense, and was not prone to anger.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Dormythyrr truly cared for his land and the people that lived in it. For this, he supported Gareth Dragonsbane 's claim to the Damaran throne totally.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dormythyrr was a simple farmer living near the Brandair capital of Goliad when the armies of Vaasa , led by Zhengyi the Witch-King , devastated his land in the Vaasan War of 1357 DR , killing all the ruling nobles and leveling Goliad. The duke, Ebelard Brandebury , died as well, leaving no heir.</p>
<p>In the Bloodstone Wars of 1359 DR , Dormythyrr led the commonfolk of Brandiar to create an army in order to support Baron Gareth Dragonsbane of Bloodstone against the minions of Zhengyi. This act managed to unify Brandiar and perhaps save the army of Bloodstone, and he gained the friendship of Gareth and the hearts of his people that day. Dormythyrr then became the provisional ruler of the Duchy. His time as steward saw the reconstruction of Goliad and the new construction of the great Church of Dionysus .</p>
<p>Within a matter of months, it had become obvious to all that Dormythyrr would be declared the new Duke of Brandiar.</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , the main road connecting Goliad to Ravensburg , the capital of Brandiar's southern neighbor of Carmathan , had been named in his honor .</p>
