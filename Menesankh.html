<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before the foundation of Mulhorand and Unther, the Menesankh region was inhabited by Turami tribes that farmed the land for centuries until the arrival of the Mulan . Since that time, and util the late years of the 14 th century DR , the Menesankh became the southern extent of both Mulhorand and Unther.</p>
<p>During the Spellplague of 1385 DR , the Menesankh was devastated by the catastrophe, although it was not hit as hard as the northern regions of Methtir and Taranoth , although its northernmost region, around Dalath, was completely devastated. After the Wailing Years , the Menesankh became part of both High Imaskar and Tymanther .</p>
<p>During the Second Sundering , in 1487 DR , the Mulhorandi rebellion toppled High Imaskar, and Mulhorand became a sovereign territory again, reclaiming their hold over their ancient lands. Tymanther, however, was able to maintain almos all of the Menesankh region after winning the First Tymanther-Unther War , while Unther was only able to reclaims the small part of the territory in the vicinity of Unthalass .</p>
