<p>Thulkaan was a rather perplexed fire giant that appeared in the ruins of Myth Drannor in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The giant appeared alongside the other fiery creatures T'Zull , Nepri , and more fire elementals inside the soon-to-be Burning Library after the city's malfunctioning mythal drew him across the planes. While the others happily set the library ablaze, Thulkaan remained in the archive room that he appeared in, utterly lost and confused (and though he wouldn't admit it, a little afraid). He may have been safely sent back home to the Elemental Plane of Fire by the library-keeping electrum dragon Jurin'ildren and the elf librarian Kaylie .</p>
