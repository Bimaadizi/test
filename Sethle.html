<p>Sethle was an undertaker from Athkatla 's Grave District in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Sethle began taking bribes from Am-Si and several other unsavory individuals to look away as they disposed of the victims of kidnappings in the Grave District's fresh graves. Sethle became a person of interest when one of the victims, Tirdir was rescued from the grave. He was able to give the investigators some clues of who was responsible, along with a piece of red cloth ripped from the kidnapper's clothes. When confronted, Sethle quickly caved in, crying that he did nothing wrong and that "he" would've killed Sethle. The undertaker knew very little about the perpetrator apart from the fact that he was dressed in red. When the corruption was revealed, some said that Sethle was killed, while others were convinced he was allowed to flee Athkatla, never to return.</p>
