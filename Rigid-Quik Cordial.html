<p>Rigid-Quik Cordial was a medicinal potion concocted and sold by Derryth and Baelen Bonecloak of Bonecloak's Apothecary , Baldur's Gate , in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Lady Madeline Whitburn of the Whitburn family of the Upper City , made a discrete purchase of Rigid-Quik Cordial via her butler, Blathers , to aid Lord "Whit" Whitburn 's problem of "stiffness". Lady Whitburn used double the recommended dosage, mixing it with a glass of evening sherry to absolutely no effect. Madeline mailed a complaint letter to the proprietors of Bonecloak's Apothecary demanding money back or an alternative potion that would aid Lord Whitburn. She asked the Bonecloaks to discretely offer an alternative upon Blathers's next visit.</p>
