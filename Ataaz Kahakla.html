Amidst the coral were also whole skeletons of sea creatures, including giant sharks and plesiosaurs . It was an awe-inspiring sight.</p>

<p>The River Tath passed through Ataaz Kahlaka as it turned sharply west to empty into Jahaka Bay between the Mistcliff Mountains to the north and the Kobold Mountains to the south.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>The jungle along the gorge was home to dinosaurs , including triceratops , as well as massive flocks of parrots . The waters were home to crocodiles .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Packs of pterafolk were known to attack travelers within the gorge.</p>
<p>Near the northern exit of the gorge dwelt the "guardian of the river": a particularly ornery plesiosaur which tried to prevent anyone from crossing.</p>
