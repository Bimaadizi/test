<p>The Imprisoners were a group of powerful mages active in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<p>Working for Larloch , they imprisoned spirits in magic items . Their ultimate goal was apparently to preserve some of Larloch's power so he could access it later. The items created were known as Blueflame items and had powerful magic contained within.</p>
<p>The church of Mystra became aware of the plot but Mystra herself apparently refused to allow any interference. The Simbul believed the Blueflame items created by the Imprisoners contained enough of Mystra's power to restore the goddess after her death in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR .</p>
