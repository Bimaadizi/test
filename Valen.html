<h2>History</h2>
<p>Valen was a mortal woman and a thief who served Bodhi as a messenger and carried out her will during the day. She was the first member of Bodhi's vampire coven to approach Abdel Adrian as he was collecting a huge sum of money to pay the vampires' bitter enemies – the Shadow Thieves . Valen offered the Bhaalsawn a meeting with Bodhi, who had a counteroffer: the same information Gorion's Ward was looking for but for 5,000 gold coins cheaper. She let Abdel know that the offer had a limited shelf life and disappeared into the Athkatlan crowd.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Valen was turned into a vampire herself and sent to assassinate Abdel Adrian on the isle of Brynnlaw , along with fellow bloodsuckers Parisa and Del . The trio was unsuccessful, and the Bhaalspawn slew the vampires. Being undead, vampires could only be destroyed in their coffins, so Valen survived the defeat in her gaseous form . Finally, Abdel Adrian confronted Valen once again when he and his companions stormed Bodhi's nest underneath Athkatla's Grave District . Valen, along with every other vampire in the den, was believed to have been destroyed by the adventurers.</p>
