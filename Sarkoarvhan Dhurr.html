<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sarkoarvhan worked as a clerk in Tethyr, enduring the treatment of cruel and pompous masters and clients. Unable to contain himself any longer, he poured his feelings and experiences into writing the novel Arauntril: Lady Death, Lady Flame . The biting and lurid prose proved extremely popular across the Heartlands , leading to an anonymous author creating the even more extreme sequel Arauntril Scourged . Although he was initially greatly upset by the imitation, once Dhurr had the chance to read it he found it quite delightful.</p>
