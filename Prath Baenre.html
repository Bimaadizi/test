<p>Prath Baenre was a young drow wizard of House Baenre in Menzoberranzan .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Prath was described as very stocky, with bulging biceps. Gromph Baenre believed that Melee-Magthere may have been more suited for him, given his martial demeanor.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Prath was in his first year of study at Sorcere . Along with the other mages of House Baenre, he aided Gromph in attacking Nimor Imphraezl through a scrying crystal. His magic missile spell was reflected back on him, nearly killing him. He was very loyal to Gromph Baenre , slicing his own pinky finger when a piece of flesh was needed for a spell during the Siege of Menzoberranzan .</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, in order to allow him to infiltrate House Agrach Dyrr to destroy the phylactery of the Lichdrow Dyrr , Gromph disguised himself as Prath and disguised Prath as Gromph. Gromph chose Prath over Nauzhror Baenre in part because he was worried that Nauzhror would get delusions of grandeur.</p>
<p>When Gromph disguised himself as Prath and entered Prath's rooms, he noticed the use of a frivolous spell that said "Welcome back Master Prath" and also a series of scrolls containing progressively complicated transmutations . After seeing his room, Gromph decided that Prath had some unforeseen potential.</p>
