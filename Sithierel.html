<p>Sithierel was a shadar-kai hexblade who piloted the Necreme in the Shadow Swamp in the Plane of Shadow in the early 1370s DR on behalf of the church of Shar there.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Serving Kithlord Thieraven , Sithierel was most likely the shadar-kai who led the black dragon Despayr through the Shadow Swamp to the Monastery of the Ebon Dome for a meeting with the priestess of Shar , Esvele Graycastle , in the early 1370s DR .</p>
<p>Thereafter, he ferried duped petitioners of the Temple of Mystra in Wheloon over the Shadow Swamp to their ultimate fates.</p>

The trip took around 10 hours. He made his journey every two days, and rested for a night at the monastery. Along the way, he refilled the beacons that lit the route with shadowlight oil and restocked on oil at the monastery. He also occasionally took Sharran leaders to the Shadowscale Warren on the dark lake .</p>

<h2>Relations</h2>
