<p>The Temple of Myrkul was a place of worship dedicated to Myrkul in Bezantur , Thay .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This temple was located near the waterfront in southeastern Bezantur, the so-called "City of a Thousand Temples". Appropriately, it was surrounded by other temples, notably the Temple of Talona to the west, the temples of Sune and Tempus to the north, and the Temple of Leira to the east.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The temple was a proud structure built of gilded wood.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The temple contained a shrine to Shar prior to the Time of Troubles as it was customary for Thayans to honor both Shar and Myrkul whenever a loved one died.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Myrkul had been one of the primary gods worshiped in Thay prior to the Time of Troubles, but after his death during that event, most of his worshipers turned to Cyric or Kelemvor . By the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , this temple was perhaps the last site dedicated to his worship in all of Faer√ªn , and was overseen by Dhimar , the powerless former high priest .</p>
