<p>A Fochlucan bandore ( pronounced : /ˈ f oʊ x l uː k ɑː n / FOKH-loo-kan listen ) was a masterwork magic bandore and one of the Instruments of the Bards .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Fochlucan bandores were 3-string instruments similar to lutes . It was fashioned from striated maple wood and inset with tiger's eye stones .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Fochlucan bandores were superior in every way to ordinary bandores. Like other Instruments of the Bards, they could only be used properly by bards , and could be dangerous if anyone else attempted to play or even carry them.</p>
<p>Bards wielding a Fochlucan bandore had their charming abilities greatly amplified by their magic.</p>
<p>Like all Instruments of the Bards, these bandores had the capability of storing spells. A bard playing a Fochlucan bandore could invoke the spells fly , invisibility , levitate , protection from evil and good , entangle , faerie fire , shillelagh and speak with animals each once a day, until the instrument recharged its magic at the next dawn. However, earlier Fochlucan bandores , those found before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , could only cast cast light , flare , mending , and message , each one a day.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first Fochlucan bandores were created by a legendary bard in the Moonshae Isles named Falataer . He used them to test and reward the students of the Fochlucan level of his bardic college, which came to be regarded individually as a legendary bard college in its own right.</p>
<p>Over time, other bards have copied the original design, while retaining the original name in Falataer's honor.</p>
