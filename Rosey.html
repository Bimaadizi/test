<p>The man known as " Rosey " was a sergeant, or musar in the army of the bakkal of Cursrah between the time of Calim 's binding and that city-state's fall.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Rosey had a birthmark on his cheek that looked something like a strawberry and that had earned him his nickname. He was a hulk of a man. As a musar , he wore a red braid.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Rosey served in the army of Cursrah for twelve years. In −6048 DR , while thoroughly inebriated, he participated in a friendly bar fight with the young officer cadet Tafir , but their raucous competition was stopped by their commanding officer.</p>
<p>Upon leaving the bar, two assassins from the hatori guild attacked Tafir's female companion, having recognized that she was in fact the princess of Cursrah, Amenstar . Amenstar found herself nearly strangled to death by a garrote and carried off to a thieves' den, but was pursued by her friends and many soldiers and civilians from the tavern. Rosey saved her life by punching her captor with a powerful blow, and he began carrying her to safety, but his neck was slit by another assassin, killing him.</p>
