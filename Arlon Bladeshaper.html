<p>After the death of Cymril in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Arlon took the leadership of a few Sons of Alagondar and founded the Nashers faction. Although at first he was leery of embracing an aggressive stance against Lord Neverember, he was convinced by Valindra Shadowmantle to abandon Cymril's methods and embrace a darker path. It was Arlon who took the decision to ally the Nashers with the Thayans and the Dead Rats of Neverwinter, although reluctantly.</p>
<p>A few months later, Arlon supported at first the self-proclaimed " Lost Heir " of the Alagondar line. However, when the "Lost Heir" began to incite a civil war among the citizens, Arlon joined forces with a group of adventurers hired by Lord Neverember to stop the "Lost Heir", as he believed that a civil war was not the best for Neverwinter.</p>
