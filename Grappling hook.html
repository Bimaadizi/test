<p>Grappling hooks were a type of tool used to secure ropes for the purpose of climbing.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Their rigid hooks were typically made of either two, three, or four welded together cast iron bars. Though hooks that could be folded flat were known to exist, they tended to cost roughly twice as much as a standard hook.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>Hooks were designed to be thrown and secured on protrusions, thereby allowing rope to support a climber's weight.</p>
<p>The intended use for grappling hooks was simply to make climbing easier and safer. However, thieves took advantage of the tool and over time it became considered a crucial tool in their line of work.</p>
<h2>Varieties</h2>
<p>A fold-able, single-pronged version of the grappling hook was included in a rope set sold by Aurora's Emporium in its "Thieves' Corner" assortment.</p>
<p>One type of grappling hook was the griffon's claw , which possessed a magically strong grasp.</p>
