<p>Taulmaril , also known as the Heartseeker , was Catti-brie 's magic bow , which passed on to Drizzt after her death (and remained with him even after her rebirth).</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<h3>Longbow</h3>
<p>Heartseeker was a beautifully crafted elven longbow +3 made of polished wood. The elven craftsmen made the bow so strong even stone cannot scratch the marvelous wood, and the deep finish of its polish can be returned by a single brush of the hand.</p>
<h3>Quiver</h3>
<p>The bow was also accompanied by the Quiver of Anariel , which contained twenty +1 alchemical silver arrows which never ran out. When an arrow was fired from Heartseeker, it became a whistling streak of silver light. Arrows launched from Taulmaril could easily bury themselves halfway into stone leaving a burned scorch mark. After a few minutes, arrows fired from Taulmaril magically dissolved, which caused a minor hissing sound.</p>
<p>After the Spellplague , the arrows were depicted as having a lightning effect. Additionally, the arrows could apparently be enchanted with light to create a torch .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally the longbow was a gift from Lady Anariel , Sister of Faer√ªn , to Clan Battlehammer , but in 1356 DR , the Companions of the Hall entered the ruins of the Hall of Dumathoin in Mithril Hall and Regis found the bow hidden in a gap in the stone wall. Later, Catti-brie gave Taulmaril to Drizzt Do'Urden after she was injured in 1370 DR . He kept the bow in his possession even after Catti-brie's rebirth, since she was no longer in practice and generally used her new proficiency in magic .</p>
