<h2>History</h2>
<p>This axe earned notoriety sometime during the 10 th century DR , during the prosperous days of the dwarvish community of the Dorn's Deep . Wielded by the dwarf-hating orc chieftain Guktok, the Chopper slew numerous stout folks of their outposts in the deep north of Faerûn . The orc's hatred was so severe, he relentlessly tortured all dwarves who were unlucky enough to be captured alive. Eventually, the dwarven forces of the Dorn's Deep brought justice on Guktok's head. His clan was whipped out of the face of the north, and Guktok's head was mounted on a pike as a warning to any other dwarf mass murderers.</p>
<p>By 1281 DR , Guktok's Chopper found its way into the ruined halls of the Severed Hand , an elven citadel at the Spine of the World . The axe was wielded by one of the shadowed ghostly orcs who dwelled among many unholy creatures that infested the Hand of the Seldarine .</p>
