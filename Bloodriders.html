<p>The Bloodriders were a unit of several dozen blood warrior cavalry riders in the service of Kazgoroth the Beast. They were created directly from living humans by Kazgoroth's magic .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Bloodriders were once a Norl cavalry unit that served as the personal guard of King Grunnarch the Red , and were said to be the most dangerous mounted warriors among the Northmen . However, they were corrupted by evil forces related to their committing massacres and subsequent firelit festivities during the Darkwalker War .</p>
<p>Bloodriders had stretched grey skin and glowing red eyes. They were able to drain power and sustenance from those they killed. This power was addictive and the Bloodrider leader Laric became fixated on killing and obtaining the power of others. Some of this power even transferred to their mounts which corrupted them toward evil. The hooves of their horses left trails of fire in their wake.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Bloodriders fought in the Darkwalker War against the Sisters of Synnoria .Â Several Bloodriders died before or during the Battle of Freeman's Down . All the rest, save Laric, were killed by Robyn 's magic during the siege of Caer Corwell . Laric was later killed by Kamerynn , aided by Robyn, Newt and Genna Moonsinger , during a failed attempt to sacrifice Robyn and absorb her power.</p>
