<p>Yeti crabs were a species of deepsea crabs that dwelled in the frigid waters of the Sea of Moving Ice in Icewind Dale .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Yeti crabs were large crustaceans named as such after a thick coat of spiny white quills that resembled a yeti 's fur. They were only found inhabiting the areas near the underwater thermal vents in the Sea of Moving Ice. Sages were unsure why these crustaceans died very quickly after being taken out of their habitat.</p>
