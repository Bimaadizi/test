<p>The Sisters of Life and Mercy were a select group of priestesses of Shiallia , the Lady of the Woods.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Sisters were active within the High Forest of northwest Faerûn , ministering Shiallia's teachings to the good creatures of the forest. The High Forest was not without its perils. Because of this, members of the Sisters of Life and Mercy were always accompanied by a trio of swanmay rangers from the Shields of Hope who protected them during their travels.</p>
