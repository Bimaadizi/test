<p>High Hall was a castle standing in the city of Elturel in the Western Heartlands . In the midâ€“14 th century DR , it was the seat of the city's government and the home of its ruler, the High Rider, at the time Lord Dhelt , and also where large commercial meetings were held. In the early 15 th century DR, it was the lair of a vampire lord, and in the late 15 th century DR, it was the residence of the High Observer, Thavius Kreeg , and the heart of Elturgard 's bureaucracy.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It stood on the southern edge of Elturel, atop a bluff or tor at the center of the city and at the edge of a cliff overlooking the River Chionthar . Its walls encircled the summit, and the soaring turrets of the castle dominated the city below. In the 15 th century, the second sun known as the Companion hovered directly over the castle, day and night.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The roofwalks were always manned by guards, on the lookout for returning Hellriders or the smoke or fire of their beacons.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>A powerful freshwater spring rose in the cellars, forming a stream that wound down the hill through the city's Garden area. It guaranteed the city's water supply.</p>
<p>Bells in the High Hall tolled to signal the start and end of the workday, which was vital in a city of perpetual daylight.</p>
<p>The large entrance to the hall had a portcullis that led out into a nearby forest. The entry room was decorated with symbols of Helm , and even had a symbol engraved into the portcullis itself.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A natural stronghold, this site had long been one of the few defensible locations between the Sword Coast and where the Chionthar met the River Reaching . At one time, it was the site of a troll lord's stronghold, and later an ogre chieftain's crude stone fortress, and at one point, the site was also held by orcs . Eventually, they were replaced by humans , who settled and built a castle here to guard against the trolls, ogres, and others. Over time, it became the possession of one lordling after another but remained as a refuge for human settlers.</p>
