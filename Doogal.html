<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , three new residents arrived in Lonelywood â€“ three trappers who did not abide by the local ranger-protector's rules. To Emmerich Hawk 's disdain, the brothers set out to trap forest beasts in the Lonely Wood without any regard for the damage they were doing to the forest. Digby and his brothers only cared about skinning and selling as many rabbit , elk , and even bears , as possible. Doogal was a de-facto leader of the trio and thought Emmerich to be an annoying sniveling brat, who was just one confrontation away from facing with violence.</p>
