<p>Talessyr Tranth was a wizard and beautician in Baldur's Gate in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Talessyr worked from a stall in the Wide , an open market of Baldur's Gate, and was a fixture there around 1366 DR . He specialized in making temporary magical alterations, such as disguises, bodily adornments, changes to costumes, and so on, for clients looking to show off at parties, surprise friends and social rivals, or conceal their true appearance. These disguises could be quite intricate and cost 50â€“200 gp . However, Talessyr did not care if thieves used these disguises for crime instead and was quick to disappear if the authorities became too annoyed.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Talessyr enjoyed creating an air of mystery, such as by getting clients disguised to look like drow or mind flayers to walk in and out of a private tent at the rear of his stall.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Talessyr appeared as a tall man with a mustache and adopted a courtly manner. This was in fact a semi-permanent disguise.</p>
<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>Only long-term residents of Baldur's Gate knew Talessyr was actually female, after her disguise failed during a number of intense magical duels.</p>
<p>One rumor said he dealt with true mind flayers at night and even served a beholder master.</p>
