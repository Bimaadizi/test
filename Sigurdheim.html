<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Sigurdheim was situated in the southeastern area of Norland, in an area surrounded by tall pine forests. The village rested on a small lake, located 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) up a narrow river flowing down from the South Jotenhammer Mountains .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>There were twenty longhouses within this village.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The people that inhabited Sigurdheim were very warlike and suspicious of strangers, keeping the Northlander culture more intact than in other areas of the Moonshae Isles . Besides Northlanders, there were a few Ffolk that lived within the village. However, outside of hunting, the two ethnic groups lived apart from each other and the Ffolk liked raiding less than their Northlander neighbors.</p>
<p>Hunting was a major facet of the village's culture.</p>
