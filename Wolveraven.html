<p>A wolveraven was type of duhlarkin created by Duhlark Kolat himself using the Duhlark's animerge spell .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These carnivorous creatures were a combination of a giant raven and wolverine . A wolveraven had a wingspan of 7 feet (2.1 meters).</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Wolveravens attacked with their hind claws, strong bite, and wing spurs.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Duhlark created four different wolveravens and bred six others from those, so he considered this version of a duhlarkin to be a success. He gave one of them to Khelben Arunsun as a gift. Duhlark released several of his wolveravens into the mountains north of Waterdeep where they helped control the populations of mountain goats and perytons .</p>
