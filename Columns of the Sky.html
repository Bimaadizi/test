<p>The Columns of the Sky were a tall mountain range in the middle of the Netheril region, which during the age of the Netherese Empire was believed to be the home of gods by the Rengarth .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Columns of the Sky were tall narrow mountains in the middle of Netheril south of the Channel Mountains . The Myconid Forest was to the Northeast, the Hadely River flowed northwest from its northern peaks, while both the Pommel Estuary and Conch River flowed south from its peaks before the sands overtook them.</p>
<p>The Columns served as an annoying landmark, as though they could be seen for hundreds of miles, they were nigh impassable and added significant time to journeys in order to travel around them.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Rengarth considered them holy far before Netheril existed, believing them the home of the gods, and killed anyone near the peaks. This caused a constant conflict with the Netherese after the establishment of the town Conch in its foothills.</p>
<p>Winged kenku lived amongst the peaks and harassed the town of Conch prior to being enslaved by the Netherese arcanist Kaeralonn Jurneille.</p>
<h2>Myths and Legends</h2>
<p>The Rengarth had many rumors about ghosts and retribution for defiling the area.</p>
<p>The Akoro goliaths believed their ancestors were Rengarth barbarians who ascended the Columns and were transformed in the act.</p>
