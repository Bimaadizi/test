<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thorstel was imprisoned by Lord Mage Ithil Sprandorn of Saskar after attempting to lord over simple pesant folk with deadly fireball magics in the Year of the Watching Wood, 1065 DR . The Lord Mage famously gave the mageling a speech of of how no wizard could beat death, and mortality was one thing common fold had with even the most powerful weavers of the arcane.
