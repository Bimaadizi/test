<p>Wavegold was the middle ruling dynasty of Amn that lasted from 1095 DR to 1237 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Wavegolds came to rule during the crisis of the Year of the Dawndance, 1095 DR , following the rapid assassinations of King Imnel IV , King Niskam the Doomed , King Rhor the Lackey , and King Dornak the Puppet King . Erdhinn Wavegold I could trace a lineage from the early Torlath dynasty through Jamyll Torlath , and took the throne to stabilize the realm before it collapsed completely.</p>
<p>The family ruled for over a century before misfortune and circumstance put an end to its name. King Belhinn Wavegold II died fighting the orcs of the Black Horde in the Year of the Grotto, 1237 DR , and the crown passed to the husband of his daughter, Princess Peldara . This made his son-in-law King Malek of the Parhek dynasty, the last royal family of Amn.</p>
