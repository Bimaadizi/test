<p>Rashara was a cambion servant of the demon lord Graz'zt in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1486 DR , Graz'zt exiled the twins Gattash and Rashara for some failures, sending them to the Waydown area. Here, however, the cambion twins, using fiendish charm and alter self spells , managed to gain the worship of a tribe of madness-infected kuo-toa , who believed them to be gods. Impressed, Graz'zt sent the hezrou Toad to serve them.</p>
<p>Gattash and Rashara planned to destroy the Red Plumes garrison inside the Waydown and go back to the court of the demon lord. They started sending some octopuses to attack Red Plume patrols.</p>
<p>With their kuo-toa minions, they resided in the Shrine of Twofold Sin in a luxury room they termed their Sanctum of Sin. However, they were killed by some adventurers hired by Arrizz .</p>
