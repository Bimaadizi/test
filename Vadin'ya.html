<p>Vadin'ya was a shady tiefling merchant from the city of Samargol , Samarach , circa 1374 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Vadin'ya had reddish skin, bright red eyes, small horns protruding from her forehead, and a devilish tail, all evidence of her fiendish bloodline. The woman wore navy blue mage 's robes and cut her red hair short. She had stunning looks, a flirty personality, confidently cooky attitude towards the people she conducted business with, whom she often gave diminutive nicknames.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Vadin'ya was never seen without her loyal half-orcish bodyguard Artiuk while doing business. Sa'Sani , a fellow merchant of Samargol, highly disliked and mistreated the tiefling woman, calling her a tart.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Vadin'ya managed her business from the Openpalm Bazar of Samargol. She offered a wide variety of exotic enchanted items, quite rare on the Chultan Peninsula . However, magical goods were not her only trade. Vadin'ya dealt in subterfuge, was an expert on poisons , and she brokered information as well as favors. In 1374 DR, Vadin'ya did business with adventurers hired by merchant Sa'Sani to investigate the strange sabotage of the Vigilant , in exchange for procuring a rare glacier snake for one of her many anonymous clients. Vadin'ya used her extensive knowledge of illicit substances to identify a rare poison â€“ chokemist , that was used in the deed.</p>
<p>Among other items Vadin'ya sought to procure were magical tusks of the feared dire boar Bal'alak and an axe , touched by fire elemental magic from the Mines of Selgol , recently taken over by firenewts . She claimed that the axe was for Artiuk. She offered a generous reward to anyone able to recover one of the pure and flawless gems found in the caverns of the Shattered Spear Batiri tribe. These flawless gems were perfect as if cut by magic and could serve as spectacular magic conduits.</p>
