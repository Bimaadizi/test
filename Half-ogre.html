<p>Half-ogres were the offspring of a human and an ogre .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Half-ogres had a height somewhere between that of a human and an ogre and taller than a half-orc , often between seven and eight feet (210 and 240 centimeters). They usually weighed between 315 and 425 pounds (143 and 193 kilograms).</p>
<p>A half-ogre's skin tone ranged from pale yellow to dull brown or even gray or black. Their thick skin was often covered in warts, and they had dark hair. Half-ogres had black blood.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Half-ogres were not very intelligent, and they typically were greatly lacking in self-control. They tended to enjoy the simple pleasures of life—eating, drinking, and partying.</p>
<p>Many half-ogres worship Vaprak , the god of ogres.</p>
<p>It should be noted that their chaotic alignment was not compulsory for all. Arzastra, a female half-ogre in Xantharl's Keep was lawful good, for example.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Half-ogres were generally thought of as large, strong, and stupid among human civilizations, but considered exactly the opposite way by ogre tribes. They were especially not trusted by dwarves or gnomes , because of their ancestry.</p>
