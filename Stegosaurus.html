<p>A stegosaurus ( pronounced : / s t ɛ g oʊ ˈ s ɑːr ʌ s / steg-o-SAR-us ), sometimes called a bloodspike behemoth , or a spiketail by the inhabitants of the Malatran Plateau , was a gargantuan, herbivorous, herd dinosaur found in Chult .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These dinosaurs were immense and had many defenses to protect them from their many predators. Along their spine from head to tail were a set of alternating bone plates. Their tails ended with a collection of sharp spikes, which were a yard (one meter) long. They had short legs with hoof-like feet.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>A stegosaurus would use the plates on its back to distribute heat from the sun.</p>
<p>They walked on four legs but could rear up to reach the leaves on tall trees.</p>
<p>They had very tiny brains and so were not very intelligent. They tended to stick together in herds of five to eight animals.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>If threatened, a stegosaurus would continuously turn away from the threat, keeping its spiked tail toward the potential enemy. If attacked, a stegosaurus would kick with its forelegs, much like a horse, or it would thrash out with its spiked tail. A stegosaurus was particularly dangerous if charging, and it could easily trample smaller creatures underfoot.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Stegosauruses, like most dinosaurs, originated in Chult.</p>
