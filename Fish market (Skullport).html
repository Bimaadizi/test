<p>The Fish Market was a open-air market located in the Lower Port of Skullport .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This small section of the Lower Port was dedicated to the sale of various seafood, including fish , mussels , and shellfish . Some of the delicacies were imported from the Lands Above, packed in ice or preserved in magical cooling chests, while others were sourced locally from the River Sargauth . To attract potential buyers, some fish were artfully displayed on beds of ice, while others were kept alive in buckets and containers filled with seawater or river water to ensure freshness at the point of sale. Despite these efforts, spoilage was common, and encounters with tainted seafood was a frequent and unfortunate souvenir for visitors to the market.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The overpowering odor of fish, particularly from those being prepared and filleted, was often so strong that it attracted scavengers from the neighboring areas of Undermountain . To safeguard the market's stock, two to four mercenaries were stationed nearby, clad in studded leather armor and armed with spears . These guards were tasked with driving away or eliminating the occasional scrag that was drawn to the scent of the market's wares.</p>
