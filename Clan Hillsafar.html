<p>Clan Hillsafar was a venerable dwarven clan based in Vaasa and renowned across northern Faerûn . They were the largest dwarf clan in the Bloodstone Lands .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The clan operated their mines nonstop, working in shifts so as to maximize their lucrative operation extracting bloodstone and copper . Their miners worked under the constant risk of unearthing the lairs of underground monsters.</p>
<p>Being all too familiar with the dangers of Vaasa, the clan maintained constant vigilance and military preparedness. They were also known to post rich bounties on particularly dangerous monsters, such as dragons or the Wandering Pit .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>Clan Hillsafar lived and worked in their mines beneath the Galena Mountains in the Sunderland region of Vaasa, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of Bloodstone Pass . The entrance to their mines was guarded by Hillsafar Hall , perhaps the greatest fortress in the Bloodstone Lands, and between 50 and 100 soldiers were always alert and on duty.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , Clan Hillsafar was close allies of the Thunkers of the Thunkers and Clan Orothiar of Bloodstone Mines . Mariabronne the Rover was known to be welcome in Hillsafar Hall, and the dwarves occasionally hosted Weird Wingham's Wacky Weapon Wielders .</p>
<p>They had a chilly relationship with the half-orcs of Palischuk , at least in the early days following that town's refounding. They were enemies of the Warlock Knights of Vaasa .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Clan traced its history back to the ancient dwarven realm of Sarphil beneath the mountains of the eastern Moonsea region . They were at the forefront of the expansion of Sarphil's tunnels and mines to beneath the southern shore of the Moonsea , where they encroached beneath the lands of the Elven Court of Cormanthor . Most notably, Clan Hillsafar served as the principle miners of a copper-rich escarpment above the Tailings Bay north of Elventree . These vast mines would be abandoned when Sarphil fell, and would remain so for more than 5,000 years until dwarven settlers out of Myth Drannor reopened them in the Year of the Angry Caverns, 672 DR . However, Clan Hillsafar had left such a mark on this area that when a town of elves , half-elves , and humans was founded to trade with the new miners, they named their settlement Hillsafar in the Clan's honor. Over the next few decades, the name would be corrupted to Hillsfar .</p>
<p>While some Hillsafar dwarves would go on to settle in the North , the clan itself persisted in the mountains north and east of the Moonsea. After the fall of Sarphil to drow and duergar invaders in −4400 DR , the dwarven clans of that realm fled north into the West Galena and Dragonspine Mountains , and Clan Hillsafar would reemerge millennia later in the Galenas. After the Year of Spreading Spring, 1038 DR , when the Great Glacier began to melt and to free the land of Vaasa from its ice, the dwarves were among the first folk to settle there. Clan Hillsafar claimed for themselves caverns below the Galenas, where they fell in love with the pure stone and the fabulously rich mines. They constructed the mighty fortress of Hillsafar Hall to defend this new home.</p>
<p>As of the mid–14 th century DR, the clan was led by King Garumbelly Hillsafar , whom the aspiring King Gareth Dragonsbane of Bloodstone sought to negotiate with. At Gareth's encouragement, the clan began trading with Damara via the Vaasan Gate in the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR . To facilitate this, they dug a tunnel extending the whole 15 miles (24 kilometers) between their mines and the Gate to provide safe transportation. At the same time, they were known to trade over the mountains directly to the Moonsea was well.</p>
<p>Over a century later in the Year of the Second Circle, 1470 DR , the Warlock Knights invaded Hillsafar Hall, and were only driven back after Garumbelly's third son, Borigon , took up the crown. King Borigon then brought together other dwarven clans who were displaced by the Knights, including Clan Orothiar—who were forced to abandon Bloodstone Mines—and then sealed the gates of Hillsafar Hall. This left the clan completely shut off from the outside world for over a decade. In the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR , they began working to help Clan Orothiar retake Bloodstone Mines.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>As of the mid–14 th century DR, the clan was 2,000 dwarves strong, although it had shrunk to 1,500 by the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . They worshiped Moradin .</p>
<p>The dwarves of Hillsafar were both miners and fighters , and always kept their arms and armor close at hand. Even the youngest among their warriors were fearsome foes. The clan counted Bloodstone Runehammers among their ranks, mighty warlords who were sworn to defend dwarven homes from monster attacks.</p>
<p>During the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, the clan was led by the legendary King Garumbelly "Grumble" Hillsafar , a gruff and direct dwarf who was nevertheless a kind and caring leader. In the late 15 th century DR, it was led by Garumbelly's third son, King Borigon Hillsafar .</p>
