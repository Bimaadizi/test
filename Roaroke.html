<p>Roaroke , also known as Rokeheart , was a popular and highly sought after variety of cheese in the Border Kingdoms .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Quality Roaroke was a rare commodity as many loved it and tried to acquire it and, as such, many inferior cheeses that imitated authentic Roaroke existed. These inferior versions of the cheese were, for the most part, made in the Border Kingdoms, whilst authentic Rokeheart was imported from elsewhere.</p>
