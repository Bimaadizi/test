<p>Horns of goodness/evil were horns that had limited musical capability but powerful enchantments .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These instruments were capable of producing only two musical tones: a high ringing carillon peal that acred as the magic circle against evil spell and a low moan that summoned a magic circle against good . Either one of these notes could be produced only once per day.</p>
<p>A variant of these trumpets, horns of goodness that could only protect the user from creatures of good, had a nasty chance of changing the bard who used it. There was a coin-toss chase that if a goodly person were to use it, the horn's magics perverted them, turning them closer to the side of evil.</p>
