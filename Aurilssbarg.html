<p>Aurilssbarg , was the largest settlement on Ice Peak island.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Aurilssbarg was a small town of about 3,000 citizens. It acted as a general trading post for incoming traders (mainly from Luskan who had established a monopoly), as well as those of Bjorn's Hold and Icewolf . Wares such as scrimshaw , oils , animal skins, and other provisions were traded. The other settlements of the isle did not have a dock large enough to serve ships from the mainland, and thus did not have a say in which communities they sold to.</p>
<p>The ground and paths of Aurilssbarg were made up of felled tree trunks. The buildings were also made of wood, and their roofs were covered in turf. Green Hall , the local tavern, was known as the "heart" of the town, and several goats were cooked for its patrons.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>A standing army of 100 soldiers manned up to six longboats. The town also owned a striker , a powerful type of ship in the North that could hold up to 44 soldiers, four ballistae, and a ram.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The residing Northmen were eager to hear any major news from the mainland.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1358 DR , the Heroes of Ascore arrived in Aurilssbarg. The leader of the small town, Tranjer Rolsk , told his guards to capture the heroes, so he could turn them over to Luskan for a reward.</p>
