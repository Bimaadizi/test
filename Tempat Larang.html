<p>Tempat Larang was a lost city of the Anok-Imaskar empire built in the 3 rd millennium before Dale Reckoning . It stood in the Shao Mountains of southern Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Anok-Imaskar was a prosperous empire that quickly spread east, north, and south across Kara-Tur. Eventually, to better govern the new southern lands his nation had claimed, circa −2300 DR , Emperor Kujawa decided to found a second capital city, Tempat Larang.</p>
<p>The emperor ordered the great Larang Highway be built along existing frontier outposts into the Shao Mountains. Many great magical scrolls and artifacts were traded from Tempat Larang to the empire during his reign.</p>
<p>However, the southern empire was harassed by the Segara Sea Lords , powerful and far-ranging pirates of the Segara Sea . When Sangkal Chunbi , governor of Tempat Larang, issued warrants for their arrest, the pirate leader Chan Chiong tried to cut Tempat Larang off from the empire by seizing Sampar , the empire's only southern harbor. However, the canny Chunbi defeated Chan Chiong through a ruse and rehired the pirates, transforming them into a southern fleet for the empire.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the nearby volcano Mount Bakos erupted in −2113 DR , covering Tempat Larang in ash and lava and in poisonous gases that slew the citizens. Thanks to its thick stone walls, the citadel survived intact, and the great wu jen of the city turned the army into stone to save them before they themselves died.</p>
<p>Over the following decades, the empire's southwestern lands were abandoned. According to later accounts, the emperor thought this disaster was an omen from the gods, and hence abandoned his plans for the south, even erasing them from official records. Thus only vague legends of Tempat Larang survived.</p>
