<p>House Sseradess was a tribe of yuan-ti known for their prowess underwater.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>House Sseradess once dominated the Thindol Basin until their lizardfolk slaves were defeated by soldiers of the Shoon Imperium in the Year of Hounds, 293 DR , forcing them to retreat to undersea lairs. They were able to gain back some control by infiltrating the courts in Thindol. However, this ended in the Year of Many Serpents, 605 DR , when all of their agents were discovered.</p>
<p>As of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , House Sseradess controlled all of the waterways of Thindol as well as Labrand's Folly –a large subterranean passage , and the Lapal Sea .</p>
<p>House Sseradess maintained the underwater coral fortress of Khass'insara near Thindol's capital city of Thindar .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Given the relative isolation of House Sseradess' holdings from the other great yuan-ti tribes, this tribe had no allies or enemies among their kin.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>House Sseradess strove to dominate the humans of Thindol since their defeats in the past. However, this was made more difficult by the vigilance of the large number of inhabitants of Thindol who feared snakes. The Sseradess were able to conquer the various kuo-toa tribes of Gathgoolgapool . They used the kua-toa to harvest food and other materials from the sea that could be sold for coin in Thindol.</p>
<p>All members of House Sseradess could breathe underwater and were completely at home in that environment.</p>
<p>The Sseradess poisoned Gurdeth 's wells with a diluted version of the poison used to create tainted ones , resulting in the creation of tainted one and broodguard servants for the house. Some of these creations were executed within the city when they ran amok.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Spiteful Stones, −289 DR , House Sseradess, along with allies from House Sauringar , enslaved the Thinguth tribe of the Guthland . The Thinguth remained as slaves of the yuan-ti until their liberation by the Shoon Imperium in 293 DR .</p>
