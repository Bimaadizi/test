<p>Dreamer's Rock was a hamlet in southeastern Cormyr on the Way of the Manticore , located between Wheloon to the west and Monksblade to the east.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Dreamer's Rock shared its name with the long, flat hill that sheltered the hamlet from storms that came off the Lake of Dragons to the south. The hill ended in a southward-facing cliff.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The hamlet and hill got their name from a long-ago elf mystic named Ilyndrathyl the Dreamer . He often levitated above the hill during a sea storm, facing its fury while apparently oblivious to it. While he did this, he sent his awareness throughout Faer√ªn and to more distant planes . One day during one of his meditations he simply vanished in a burst of flame. It was believed that some entity had realized the elf was observing it, and it destroyed him.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The people of Dreamer's Rock primarily herded sheep and grew vegetables. They surrounded their vegetable plots with ditches and stakes to discourage animals from grazing them.</p>
<p>They also did some copper mining by digging shallow caves into the hill, though most villagers lacked the ability to work the copper and simply sold the ore to passing merchants . Occasionally, these caves were used by beasts that the villagers hunted for food or to stop their predations. The caves were also used by outlaws and smugglers, and travelers seeking shelter from bad weather. Smugglers often paid the locals for the private use of a cave, but some ruthless ones would then kill the villager they paid in order to ensure their silence.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>A prominent family of Dreamer's Rock were the Talvurs , as described in the book The Talvurs of Talvurgates by Eldethelle Talvur . The farming family produced an array of Purple Dragons , adventurers , and other such interesting folk.</p>
