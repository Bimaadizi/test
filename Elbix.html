<p>Elbix was a famous gnome apprentice conjurer who made a name for himself thanks to the greatly exaggerated powers of Elbix's Stonestick .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Elbix was prone to telling lies and telltales, especially if it gave him fame and free drinks in taverns.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before 1372 DR , Elbix managed to summon an elder earth elemental who gifted him the Stonestick , a magic rod . The elemental explained the item's powers to the gnome and was gone. Inspired by this event and the otherworldly gift, Elbix started retelling the story of the elemental and the "powerful" rod he received in exchange for attention and free drinks at the local tavern. The tall-tales grew wilder with years going by, making everyone believe Elbix's Stonestick was a legendary artifact .</p>
<p>Eventually, the gnome town became threatened by a gang of marauding ettins , led by Chief Gnarltooth . Sure of Elbix and his rod's awesome powers, the settlement decided not to set up any defenses or the upcoming battle, thinking the ettins would be wiped out with a single rod swing. The leader of the gnome town summoned Elbix and commanded him to defend his home. The amateur conjurer was sure his death was inevitable, but he did as he was askedâ€”he met Gnarltooth on the field of battle. The ettin chief snatched the little gnome to take a closer look but flailing Elbix accidentally hit him in the eye with the Stonestick , causing Gnarltooth to tumble and impale himself on his own spear . With their leader defeated, the ettins dispersed, and the settlement was safe.</p>
<p>Surviving thanks to unbelievable luck or Tymora 's blessing, Elbix intended not to tempt fate again if danger ever arrived in the town and tossed his "artifact" into the closest river.</p>
