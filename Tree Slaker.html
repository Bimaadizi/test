<p>The Tree Slaker was an otherwise unnamed, malicious, druid who both viciously murdered humanoids as well as served as protector of the Night Trees in Luruar .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Tree Slaker would ensnare, capture and bind humanoids who ventured within the duo of forests known as the Night Trees. He would typically use nature spells like wood shape and control plants to bind his victims to trees and slowly kill them via bloodletting. He was aided in these murders by a few select acolytes, typically other druids or fallen rangers .</p>
<p>Both the malevolent druid, his disciples, as well as some of the more vicious plants of the Night Woods, such as the assassin vines and shambling mounds , all guarded an ancient temple of Chauntea that had been corrupted by some evil force.</p>
