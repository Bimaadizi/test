<p>The Garrison of Surcross in Thay was a building that housed the living portion of the city's Thayan soldiers as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>It was the second-most fortified building in the city (after the Tombstone ) and was a long hall of reinforced, heavy stone.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The building contained many inner passages, rooms, and chambers comprising the communal barracks. Each room of the barracks could house dozens of soldiers, who were segregated by race (into humans , gnolls , orcs , half-orcs , and "other") but not segregated by gender. These barracks were simple, often including not more than a footlocker and a cot for each soldier. The exception was a single, opulent room that served as the barracks for a contingent of warlocks known as the Sunmasters , who had wardrobes , luxurious mattresses , thick carpets, and fine food and wine .</p>
<p>The structure included a main hall, at the end of which were a series of teleportation circles that allowed the troops to instantly travel to the Tombstone, the Gates of Bone , or any of the five Fingers of Szass Tam .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Undead guards watched the garrison's entrances and did not allow entry to anyone who did not have a pass or a uniform, either of a Thayan soldier or a Red Wizard .</p>
