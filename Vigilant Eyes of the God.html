<p>The Vigilant Eyes of the God was an order of the paladins of Helm that sought out evil that threatened innocent lives, and insinuated themselves as a bulwark of protection. They possessed a sterling reputation among the citizens of Faer√ªn , who saw the knights as exemplars of benevolence.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The order was formed sometime around the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . Its ranks swelled greatly following the atrocious slaughter of natives, at the hands of the Companions of the One True Vision , on the continent of Maztica . As many of the Companions were wracked with guilt and sought penance for their crimes, the church of Helm encouraged them to join the Vigilant Eyes.</p>
