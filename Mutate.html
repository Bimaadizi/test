<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Myriad creatures could be transformed into mutates. Notable among these were various humanoid races, along with cloakers and otyughs and others.

<p>While some mutates were created by inadvertent exposure to Far Realm energy and magic, others made the conscious decision to bring it upon themselves.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Mutates often developed some form of psionic power.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Throughout their history, the illithids of Toril conducted experiments upon animals, beasts, and sentient beings with Far Realm energy. Their efforts created many of the mutates that dwelled within the depths of the Underdark .</p>
