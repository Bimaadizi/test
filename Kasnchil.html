<p>Kasnchil was the baron of the city of Surbar in Ulgarth around 1367 DR .</p>
<p>Kasnchil was the most corrupt and greedy of Ulgarth's barons, and this affected his legal judgments. He permitted all kinds of trade through Surbar, which made it a popular port and a prosperous city, but this knew no limits: even Dambrathan pirates could dock there to resupply and refit. However, the serfs thought he made the city prosper.</p>
