<p>The Sibylline Sisterhood was a group of female oracles devoted to Savras , the All-Seeing One.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Sisterhood wandered west Faerûn sharing prophecies and visions with those willing to pay a modest fee. While accurate, the visions were often clouded so that the recipient usually only appreciated their value in hindsight. Most of the members of the Sibylline Sisterhood were novice sibylites .</p>
