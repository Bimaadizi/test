<p>The Purple Rocks were an archipelago in the Trackless Sea located west of Gundarlin beyond the warm water of The River . They appeared as rocky outcroppings, but verdant valleys were sheltered from the storms behind their sparse forested peaks.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Under stormy skies, the islands acquired a dark, purplish hue. It was this feature they were named for.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The dragon Galadaeros considered the Purple Rocks its territory, and it was believed that Flamehome Isle , as he called its lair, was actually one of these two islands.</p>
<h2>Islands</h2>
<h2>Climate</h2>
<p>The Purple Rocks, along with Tuern , Gundarlun and Ruathym , live at the mercy of far harsher sea storms than those on the mainland, and have a winter spanning nearly eight months a year. The Aurilsbreath (as the islanders called the bitter and constant winter winds), froze everything not built on the lee side of the islands. When not frozen by the Aurilsbreath , the islands were shrouded in a dense fog that lasted through the day, and its summers were even cooler than subarctic ones.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Here, like in rural communities all over the North and other outer islands like Tuern , magic use was punishable by death. People of the Purple Rocks appeared to worship Tempus (called Tempos ), Auril and Umberlee , the usual Northman deities, but their idols of those gods all showed many tentacle-like arms.</p>
<p>By the time of the War of the Silver Marches in the late 15 th century DR , the people of Utheraal and Trisk were dominated by the kraken Slarkrethel .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Rocklanders, or the people of the Purple Rocks, were originally a colony from Gundarlun Island . Later, both the western island Trisk and its eastern neighbor Utheraal grew into independent island-nations, with the latter paying Trisk a steep sum of gold to avoid war. This situation ended abruptly in the 1368 DR , when the longships of King Selger landed upon the shores of Utheraal and the battle for control of Vilkstead took place, resulting in the deaths of King Bromm and 200 of the island's best warriors.</p>
