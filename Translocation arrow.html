<p>Translocation arrows , also known as arrows of transposition, were extremely rare types of enchanted ammunition, almost never found in bulk.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Usually, translocation arrows appeared to be regular well-crafted arrows with a green crystal attached to the arrow's shaft, right at the arrowhead. Even when they were kept in quivers, some users could swear their translocation arrows constantly switched places with one another.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Translocation arrows were imbued with potentially dangerous magics. When used as regular weapons, they dealt minuscule damage to their targets. However, their purpose was not offensive, but utilitarian or strategic. Upon a successful hit, translocation arrows blinked the shooter to the arrow's target. When used in combat, these arrows could be wielded by warriors handy with bows . They shot the arrow to instantly be transported into melee fighting range.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , several of these rare arrows could be found in Lonelywood and the wider Ten Towns area of Icewind Dale . And by the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , arrows of transposition were known to see use in the Western Heartlands and in the city of Baldur's Gate . Some of their notable users were Harper quartermaster Talli who served under the High Harper Jaheira , a tiefling refugee smith Dammon , and the deep gnome named Barcus Wroot , all in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
