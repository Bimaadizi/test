<p>Gypsy-bard Class Statistics 2e 2nd Edition Statistics Kit Kit for Bard Requirements Alignment LG NG CG LN N CN LE NE CE Race Elf , half-elf , human List of known gypsy-bards Gypsy was a general term used to refer to itinerant people of a typically roguish nature, though the exact prevalence of rogues among such people was possibly exaggerated. Such people might otherwise be referred to as forest nomads for their rural lifestyles and habit of traveling through woodlands, or in some places as tzigone .</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>People classified as "gypsies" lived rural, nomadic lives, traveling from place to place, sometimes in groups with horse -drawn carts and wagons , such as the vardos . Occasionally they settled in one place for an extended period of time and operated stores. The life of a gypsy was usually had by humans , elves , or half-elves . Elves were generally well disposed to such people, especially wood elves , as were most rogues, bards , rangers , and druids . They ranged the gamut in terms of alignment , but tended towards lawfulness or neutrality .</p>
<p>All gypsies lived by some form of rigid code of personal honor and laws. These were colored by the morality and values characteristic of each individual's alignment, but usually were considered unconventional in some manner by non-itinerant people. A common aspect among these codes was a looser conception of property and ownership, feeling that in many cases ownership was a fleeting thing and not a sacred right. This worldview gave way to a rather roguish nature that instilled among some outsiders a sense of distrust towards gypsies.</p>
<p>They generally did not have any societal hierarchies, although sometimes they would lay claim to the titles of "King" or "Queen" in order to gain advantage in bartering, as was the case with some gypsies in the Vast.</p>
<p>Much like bards, gypsies often knew a great deal of lore thanks to all their traveling, having gathered much knowledge and common sense during their journeys. This, coupled with a common proficiency in music, lead many such people to take up the life of a true bard.</p>
<p>What gypsies were most well known for were their skills in fortune-telling or soothsaying, often charging a price for their services. They often utilized decks of cards in telling fortunes, such as a tarokka deck, or crystal balls.</p>
<p>There existed a great variety of gypsy groups across the wider Realms, as well as beyond Toril itself in the form of the aperusa of wildspace , the Rhennee of Oerth , and in the Domains of Dread , with the most notable group of Ravenloft being the Vistani .</p>
<p>Throughout Faerûn 's Western Heartlands and further to the east in the Endless Wastes there were the Gur , a human ethnic group believed by scholars to be descended from Rashemaar . The land of Rashemen in northeast Faerûn was likewise known to have gypsies that traveled far. The greater Heartlands region and its neighboring regions were also home to an obscure nomadic group called the Valantra , the namesake for spelldancers . In west Faerûn , the nation of Amn was home to large gypsy groups known as the Rom , with one notable member being Kveroslava who met the adventurer Gorion's Ward . And the Dalelands of north Faerûn were home to some gypsy groups, one of which the weretiger Jahed originated from and traveled with most of his life before being dragged into the Domains of Dread.</p>
<p>In the Vast , another region of northern Faerûn, was home to many people that identified as gypsies, especially in the city of Ravens Bluff . There anyone not a member of the city's bards guild had to pay for a temporary permit in order to perform, an exception was notably made for gypsy bards so long as they first paid their respects at the guildhouse after entering the city. Nevertheless, the guild was also host to some gypsy members. Notable gypsies in the city included the silk merchant Madame Coth ; Asmera , a fortuneteller on Bubba Street ; Kisandra , a fortuneteller who offered temporary housing to the wandering gypsies of the Vast at the Crescent Moon ; Madame La Tachia ; and Jadrian , a jewelry merchant and member of the Knights of the Hawk .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Gypsies were often gifted in the Art , though sometimes limited to the school of divination magic. Common spells included clairaudience , clairvoyance , ESP , object reading , precognition , and telepathy . Fledgling mages, not yet skilled enough to use true forms of divination magic, might resort to learning spells that would allow them to fake seances, such as magic mouth , ventriloquism , unseen servant , and audible glamer . In place of arcane magic, other gypsies cultivated a connection with nature and gained the use of druidic spells, such as animal friendship , locate animals or plants , and speak with animals .</p>
<p>Beyond magic, it was quite common for gypsies to be psions , often spontaneously developing powers as wild talents. Those gifted with such abilities typically gained or chose to study the psionic equivalents of clairaudience , clairvoyance , ESP , and telepathy , as well as the unique psionic powers animal telepathy and telepathic projection .</p>
<p>Many gypsies uniquely possessed an ability to lay curses upon people, with some being so powerful that only a deity or the gypsy themselves could undo a curse. They also had an affinity for identifying or recognizing the presence of curses.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Beyond innate abilities, gypsies often possessed or were skilled with magic items that emulated divination spells and utilized them in their fortune-telling, such as crystal balls , medallions of ESP , and the rare deck of many things . However, some merely had mundane crystal balls. In terms of armor , gypsies generally avoided metal forms of protection as their heaviness and noisiness was anathema to a roguish approach. This left them to choose such things as hide armor , leather armor , studded leather , padded armor , and sometimes even elven chainmail , though others felt even the metalwork of elves couldn't be trusted when it came to stealth.</p>
<p>Across many realms it was commonly found that gypsies wore vibrant clothing. In the Vast for instance, gypsy women were well known for dressing in embroidered skirts that were brightly colored.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Rather than engaging in direct confrontations, gypsies preferred the rather roguish approach of stealth and trickery. They were typically quite skilled in fighting with daggers and knives, though were also known to fight with such weapons as bows , crossbows , and one-handed swords like the khopesh and scimitar . They generally forewent two-handed weaponry, such as polearms .</p>
