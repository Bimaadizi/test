<p>A Horn of Valhalla was a wondrous item that had the power to summon forth the spirits of barbarians from the afterlife to fight for the summoner.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The horns came in five different types, which appeared to be normal horns until the command word was spoken. In ascending order of potency, these varieties were ivory , iron , bronze , brass , and silver . Iron horns could summon as few as two barbarians, while silver horns could summon up to ten. Ivory horns of Valhalla pressed three charges, each summoned an ivory shieldmaiden construct to aid the horn's owner in battle.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime long before the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , a bard -specific Horn of Valhalla was created by the respected Reghedmen bard, Beogin , whose songs were sang across many of the northern barbarian tribes. The bard took his Horn of Valhalla into many gran d battles of his tribe. Beogin was ordered by his chieftain to blow the horn were he ever in grave danger, however the bard's pride kept him from doing so as he died in battle with the horn hidden under his fur cloak .</p>
<p>Another variety, an ivory horn of Valhalla , was created by the powerful bard of the Moonshae Isles named Falataer . The original horn was used to test his students and reward them when appropriate. With years passing, ivory horns of Valhalla were copied and imitated.</p>
<p>Years later, Beogin's Bardic Horn of Valhalla ended up in possession of Gerth , a trader proprietor of Gerth's Equipment Shoppe of Kuldahar and a collector of ancient missilery.</p>
<p>Circa 1368 DR , the traveling merchant and instrument-maker Maheer yn Kadar el Saddith was capable of "upgrading" a horn of Valhalla to the version of next higher potency.</p>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , a group of adventurers from the city of Ravens Bluff on the world of Toril traveled to Ysgard in search of the legendary Well of Mimir . While traveling in Asgard , they stopped at the hall of Gloamingard at the same time as the Seelie Court was visiting. Queen Titania , desiring some entertainment, challenged the adventurers to a series of friendly competitions against her fey entourage. For their trouble she offered as prizes an ice sapphire , a Svartalfheim cloak , and a horn of Valhalla made of iron that she referred to as Tyjar's horn .</p>
