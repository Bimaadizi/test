<p>Ilvani was the witch of Ikemmu in the Shadowfell and the twin sister of Natan , the former high priest of Ikemmu. In 1479 DR , Ilvani was sent on an expedition to scout an area of the Shadowfell north of Ikemmu. Her party was captured by a shadar-kai enclave and most of the members were tortured to death. Ilvani survived her imprisonment and was rescued by a group lead by the Ikemmu warrior Vedoran .</p>
<p>A young Shadar-kai in the rescue party named Ashok was falsely accused of conspiring against Ikemmu by Vedoran. Ilvani destroyed a crucial piece of evidence against Ashok although Ashok was still imprisoned.</p>
<p>In 1480 DR , Ilvani began having disturbing visions. In some of the visions, the ghost of a Rashemi witch appeared to her. The visions continued to worsen and whenever Ilvani was near shadow creatures they would go berserk.</p>
<p>Along with Ashok, Cree and Skagi , Ilvani traveled with a caravan led by Tatigan Carrlock to Rashemen to seek the source of the visions. The visions were caused by the spirit of a witch named Yaraella who had been murdered by Sree ,a Wychlaren . Ilvani confronted Sree and put Yaraella's spirit to rest which ended the hauntings. She agreed to remain in Rashemen for a while to help train Yaraella's daughter.</p>
<h2>Mental State</h2>
