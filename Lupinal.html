<p>Lupinals were wolf-like guardinals that lived in Elysium and the House of Nature . They often formed temporary packs as they roamed their celestial home, but were just as often solitary.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lupinals looked half-man, half- wolf , with a wolf-like face, silver-grey fur, and legs on a humanoid body. Although they could be mistaken for werewolves , lupinals were considerably more intelligent and poised.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Like most guardinals, lupinals were normally peaceful but ferocious when in a fight. They were constantly vigilant against evil incursions, and they were typically suspicious of strangers as well. Lupinals had a variety of spell-like abilities, were very good at stealth (which they used to ambush enemies), and used pack tactics to great effect while fighting.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>The ruler of the lupinals was Kharash the Stalker. Lupinals were also known to serve the goddess Mystra .</p>
