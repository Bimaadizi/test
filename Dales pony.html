<p>The Dales pony was a breed of working equine that was commonly found throughout the ranches and farms of the Dalelands . They were also popular throughout northeast Faerûn , as a training pony kept by the wealthy upper class.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These ponies were exceptionally varied in appearance, due to the fact they had been bred with just about every stock of pony or horse from throughout the Realms.</p>
<p>Despite their diverse stock, the ponies of the Dales maintained a few key characteristics: a sure-footed stance, a powerful jump, and a strong sense of self-preservation.</p>
