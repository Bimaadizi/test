<p>The Sighing Vault was a Narfell vault in Dun-Tharos .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The vault extended for several hundreds of yards from the entrance to its middle; it was a single underground space, with a great subterranean ceiling.</p>
<p>There was a second, smaller, round salt-white limestone dome in the approximate middle of the vault. That dome had a single entrance, which led to a narrow corridor that spiraled nine times to a single chamber in the middle of the vault; its ceiling vaulted to about 20 ft (6.1 m).</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>There were dilapidated domes, sarcophagi, containers earthernware and otherwise scattered and broken throughout. Larger vessels of stone and iron filled the cavern, so big that they resembled buildings; there were narrow clear spaces between them. These vessels were sometimes carved with faces, bodies, skulls, and fell symbology. Per Ususi Manaallin , there was little magic to be detected.</p>
<p>The smaller vault in the middle was eggshell white on the inside, with nine pedestals.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>Shapes inside the vault glowed with foul light. Dust had accumulated for over a millenium. The slightest sound created whispering echoes.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The demon Eschar guarded the vault. The inner dome of the vault could only be accessed by walking around it nine times, each time speaking aloud the name and title of one lord of the Nine Hells in order.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of 1373 DR , four of the nine pedestals in the center dome were empty; of the other five, only one held its original item: a night black cloak draped across a perfectly shaped hanger. The last four held items collected by Eschar, including a red dagger made of a single red talon, an orb of hazy green set in a golden ring, a sword made of bone, and the Queen Abiding 's controlling token. After Ususi Manaallin opened the vault, the priest Marrec recovered the token.</p>
