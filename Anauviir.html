<h2>History</h2>
<p>When in 240 DR, Helm Stoneblade found a scrying crystal, and Halidar among his men attempted to escape upon appearing to recognize the device, it was Anauviir that struck that man down. He was the last to kneel when approached by the elf Ruvaen and the prince Elminster Aumar .</p>
<p>During the siege proper, he accompanied Helm Stoneblade as they were led by Farl , a local underworld personality, who knew of a secret passage that allowed entry to the castle through the sewers and ultimately the jakes. He crawled through the pipe leading up to Briost Elthauryn 's chambers.</p>
<p>He continued to fight through the siege, making a last stand at some point together with Helm and Darrigo Trumpettower .</p>
<p>Anauviir survived that point in the confrontation, and during the subsequent coronation, he questioned why Myrjala Talithyn , a sorceress who helped during the fight, did not kneel before the new king. She directed him to ask Mithtyn .</p>
