<p>Oils of elemental plane invulnerability were a variety of different magical oils that could protect one from the elements . There existed an oil for each of the Inner Planes , the six major ones as well as the twelve minor planes.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These oils came in flasks that had enough liquid to coat a single human -sized creature six times or six individuals once.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Those who applied one of these oils to their body were provided total invulnerability to the elemental environmental forces of their oil's respective plane. This included being able to breathe, see, and move around in it without difficulty. For example, those doused in an oil of earth elemental plane invulnerability could pass through the stone on that plane as if it were merely air.</p>
