<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Fist Thadwick was a member of the Flaming Fist cadre, which accompanied Counselor Florrick and Duke Ravengard on a mission to Elturel . They stopped over at Waukeen's Rest inn, where they fell victim to the Cult of the Absolute 's ambush in which Ulder Ravengard was kidnapped. Florrick and her Fists marched towards the Moonrise Towers to rescue the Duke but were waylaid by the dangers of the Shadow-cursed lands . Fist Thadwick and the rest found shelter in the Last Light Inn , where they met High Harper Jaheira and her Harpers who sought to end the life of General Ketheric Thorm , the leader of the Absolute's army.</p>
<p>When a group of True Souls arrived at the Last Light Inn, Thadwick was among those present for the events that followed. He distrusted the arrivals and kept them out of Fist business. It was unknown if Thadwick survived the war with the Absolute; he might had perished after the darkness consumed the Last Light Inn, or else he survived with the rest, storming the Moonrise Towers to end General Thorm's reign.</p>
