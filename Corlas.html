<p>Sir Corlas was one of Rangrim 's warriors in the incursion against the Cult of the Dragon enclave in the Gray Forest , near Lyrabar on Tarsakh 12 . After Rangrim died, he retreated with his men; it took Taegan Nightwind , Jivex , and several transformed elves to help them to regroup.</p>
<p>He wore a lady's scarf tied to his helmet. In Tarsakh 12, he was wearing plate armor, a shield, and a surcoat . He was also quite impatient to withdraw from the fight, but ultimately acquiesced to Taegan's attempts at awakening Vorasaegha .</p>
