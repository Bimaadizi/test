<p>Omen, Herald of the Fall was a powerful falchion found in the ruins of Myth Drannor in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Omen was an adamantine vorpal falchion that blazed with a terrible fire. It could slay almost anything with a single chop, and was further empowered by the wielder's religious fervor.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The falchion was made during the Weeping War , initially as a sign of hope and then of desperation. It eventually ended up in the Cult of the Dragon base hidden in the ruins, which was taken over by the Red Wizards of Thay of Droic Orgul while capturing the dracolich Karliath . The blade may have then been taken by the Cormanthor Elves when Phathroi had them attack.</p>
