<p>Kanabar was a beholder that dwelled within the Greypeak Mountains during the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kanabar was among those beholders enthralled by the phaerimm that escaped from the Sharn Wall within the depths of the Shaeradim in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR . The eye tyrants were ordered to hunt down the Shadovar sorcerer Melegaunt Tanthul and then wipe out the stone giant settlement of Thousand Faces in the Greypeaks.</p>
<p>During the takeover of Thousand Faces, Kanabar charmed a lone giant by the name of Aris , sparing his life from its fellow beholders. Some time later, the elven warrior Galaeron Nihmedu rescued Aris and incapacitated Kanabar with a shadowy, gum-like material, and used its own anti-magic ray to undo the charm placed upon him. Finally freed, the stone giant gripped the devious floating eye in his palm and smashed it on the cliff side like a ripe melon .</p>
