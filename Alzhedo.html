<p>Calishite Alzhedo was a regional tongue of Southwest Faer√ªn , and the main language of Calimshan . Other regions where it was commonly spoken included: Amn , Chult , the Lake of Steam , Lapaliiya , Lantan , the Nelanther Isles , the Shaar , Tashalar , Tethyr , Waterdeep (among dwarves , elves , and gnomes ), the Western Heartlands (among halflings and planetouched ), the Wealdath , Tharsult , and the Old Shanatar region of the Underdark .</p>
<p>Alzhedo, like most primarily human tongues, used the Thorass alphabet .</p>
<p>Alzhedo was a derivative language of Untheric and was in the same language family as Midani .</p>
<p>Common Alzhedo surnames included Basha, Dumein, Jassan, Khalid, Mostana, Pashar, and Rein.</p>
<p>Calishite Alzhedo was very closely related to Old Alzhedo , the language spoken on the Elemental Plane of Air , and this fact lends credence to the theory that the first civilizations in the Calimshan area were made up of travelers from that plane. Alzhedo was spoken at court, in all government and judicial proceedings, and throughout polite Calimshan society. It was a more guttural language than Old Alzhedo, and included many elements from Common , Dwarvish , and Elvish . The majority of Calishites speak the High Calidrian dialect.</p>
