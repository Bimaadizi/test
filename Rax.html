<p>Rax was a powerful shadow mastiff summoned by Variance Amatick in 1373 DR to attack the people of Yhaunn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Rax was exceptionally large and powerful among shadow mastiffs, the size of a warhorse and covered in scars.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On the night of the new moon on Eleasis 15 , in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , the shade priestess of Shar Variance Amatick summoned 18 shadow mastiffs and then pulled forth Rax. Invoking ancient contracts, she offered Rax command of half of the mastiffs and the mission of hunting and killing in the Stiltways while she attacked Moonshadow Hall and her unwilling servant Keph Thingoleir stole The Leaves of One Night from Fourstaves House . In exchange, the lordly mastiff would be allowed to hunt at will in Faerûn for three nights.</p>
<p>Rax agreed to the terms and took the other shadow mastiffs on a hunt in the Stiltways, distracting the city guard and preventing them from defending Moonshadow hall when it too was attacked. Fortunately for the people of the Stiltways, the residents of Fourstaves House—the spellcasters Strasus , Dagnalla , Roderio , Malia and Krin —burst forth to defend the city and managed to prevent the shadow mastiffs from killing anyone. Realizing the threat the great beast and its pack posed, Feena Archwood and Keph forced Variance to banish them early, returning them to their home plane.</p>
