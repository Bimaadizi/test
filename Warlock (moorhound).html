<p>Warlock was a large, strong moorhound owned by Angus Blackstone .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR , Currag Blackstone set Warlock and the pack of moorhounds on an old man who had approached the gate of the manor. With a spoken command, the man was able to stop the pack of moorhounds and with another, they fled, inexplicably jumping a 20‑foot (6.1‑meter) tall palisade.</p>
