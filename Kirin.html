<p>The kirin was a type of tree that grew on the eastern side of the Thunder Peak Mountains in Cormyr .</p>
<p>The herb known as kirin's leaf was derived from these trees. When they were ground up and mixed with certain reagents, it would produce a solution that was bottled and turned into a potion that reversed the emotions of the drinker. If the pure powder was mixed into an existing drink, it also had a mood-altering effect.</p>
