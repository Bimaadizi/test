<p>The Testament of Vraer was a spellbook written by Vraer , a cleric of Kelemvor .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Testament of Vraer was a large rectangular book, 2 feet (61 centimeters) in width and 1 foot (30 centimeters) in height. Its cover was thick, made from the hide of a rothé which was dyed black and textured. There was no title on the cover. Its main distinguishing feature was its spine, which made from a single human bone, both ends carved into skulls.</p>
<p>The tome contained twenty-seven pages of thin parchment, each containing the text for a single spell. It was divided into three sections by three glossy black pages, each showing a different enchanted image.</p>
<p>The first page was called the "Skullpage" and marked the beginning of the "forehand" section. It contained the image of a human skull. The second page, called "Handpage", marked the beginning of the middle section of the tome and show the image of a skeletal human hand. Attached to this page was a strip of black ribbon, decorated with the holy symbol of Kelemvor. The final page, called "Tailpage", marked the beginning of the "afthand" section and showed the image of the skeletal tail of an undetermined creature.</p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>The tome was guarded by powerful magic. It was safe to read for clerics of the Church of Kelemvor . Anyone else who wished to view the contents of the tome had to open it in a specific fashion to avoid triggering the guardian magic protecting it.</p>
<p>To examine the spells located in the forehand section, clerics of other faiths had to open the book at the Skullpage, then the Tailpage. To examine the spells located in the afthand section, the Tailpage had to be seen first, then the Skullpage. An individual who was not a cleric had to open the book at the Handpage then look at either the Skullpage or Tailpage. After opening the book properly, one could read the spells throughout as they pleased.</p>
<p>Failure to open the book properly triggered the guardian magic. If the book was opened at the forehand section, a necrophidius appeared for each spell examined. The summoned necrophidiuses attack all living creatures within 90 feet (27 meters), They continued to do so until either they were destroyed or all living creatures nearby were killed, afterwards they mounted a guard over the tome.</p>
<p>If the book was opened the afthand section, six crawling claws shot out from the page, and another six for each page viewed after. Any magical or physical attack on the tome itself caused chain lightning to erupt from the book. A wounded individual could touch the tome and call out for Kelemvor's aid temporarily received clairvoyance . This effect only functioned every three months per being.</p>
