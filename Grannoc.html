<p>Grannoc was an anchorite of Talos who grew and nurtured a Gulthias tree in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Grannoc was a half-orc who dressed in hide armor and was a devout follower of Talos , the god of storms. He was known to perform eerie dances while invoking his god, and to become enraged if anyone dared to interrupt him.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As an anchorite of Talos, Grannoc was blessed by his god with storm-themed spells , including the ability to cast lightning bolt , and was also a shapechanger who could adopt the form of a boar . Thanks to his connection with the Gulthias tree he had nurtured, Grannoc also possessed the unique ability to command any blights spawned from the tree.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Grannoc was the only member of the anchorites of Talos known to keep a map that marked the location of their headquarters at the sacred Circle of Thunder in southern Neverwinter Wood .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the late 15 th century DR, Grannoc was a member of the anchorites of Talos who venerated their god's servant, Gorthok the Thunder Boar , at the Circle of Thunder.</p>
<p>At some point not long before the arrival of the white dragon Cryovain in the region , Grannoc travelled to the ruins of the Woodland Manse not far from the Circle of Thunder, and planted a Gulthias tree at the bottom of the well. He then took over the ruin as his base, and used the evil tree to nurture and grow twig blights and vine blights that obeyed only him. He sent these blights to range throughout Neverwinter Wood and harass the anchorites' enemies, and several were sent back to the Circle of Thunder to bolster the site's defenses. Meanwhile, three more anchorites joined Grannoc at the Woodland Manse to oversee the raising of pumpkins and boars for the organization's food supply and rituals .</p>
<p>After Cryovain drove the orcs from Icespire Hold in the Sword Mountains , many sought refuge with the anchorites. A contingent took up residence in the Woodland Manse under Grannoc's supervision, and alongside his blights, they used the ruin as a staging ground to launch attacks on Neverwinter hunters at Falcon's hunting lodge . Grannoc himself remained at the Manse, and performed profane rituals involving the consumption of possum entrails to beseech Talos for aid in destroying the hunters.</p>
