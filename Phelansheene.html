<p>Phelansheene was a cursed sorceress trapped in the northern village of Amphail . By the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , she was better known to the Amphailans as the Weeping Witch , a unique ghost tied to the Stone Stallion , the only local inn.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As the Weeping Witch, Phelansheene often appeared as a woman with cascading tresses so long they concealed her face. She wore darkly colored robes but never any shoes, and rarely made a sound as she moved to watch the sleeping guests of the Stone Stallion—before slipping away, either walking or gliding down the halls into another room.</p>
<p>On certain nights, when she truly lived up to her name, the quiet sobbing of the Weeping Witch could be heard. Although she remained out of sight, the sound of her restrained, mournful cries seemed to echo unnervingly close. There were yet other nights when Phelansheene became far more than a mere apparition, corporeal enough to be capable of violence—most often strangling her foes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Phelansheene was a sorceress with a spellbook full of ancient and powerful Netherese spells . Once in Amphail she was engaged in a battle with a Red Wizard of Thay . The Red Wizard ended up trapped in a crystal ball hidden in the village and Phelansheene was cursed to manifest in Faerûn only on nights of a full moon and only in Amphail, because her spellbook remained there.</p>
<p>She was in love with Thorn Tlassalune .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The Amphailians recounted the history of the Weeping Witch as a tragic tale—one that was entirely untrue, at least according to the esteemed Elminster of Shadowdale . Local legend surmised that she had been a sorceress, said to have studied from Netherese spellbooks , which contained, within their pages, potent and unique spells . Of yore, she lived where Amphail would eventually be settled, using her mastery of the Art to protect herself from orcs and their depredations.</p>
<p>Notably, the magic she used to defend herself was transformative, making the local fauna— foxes and hares —into terrible monsters. They were controlled entirely by her, a benefit that would prove unfortunate when the woman who would become the Weeping Witch, one day, erred. She unleashed her beasts onto an innocent visitor and soon realized the horrible truth: that her victim had also been her betrothed. Anguished at the realization, she ran from the scene and from her Art, weeping, only to quickly meet her own demise at the hands of an orcish ambush.</p>
