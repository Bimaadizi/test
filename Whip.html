<p>Whips were a type of exotic, one-handed melee weapon.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The whip was a long, flexible, braided leather cord which tapered gradually from the handle to the tip. The handle was either thick braided leather or leather-covered wood and was 8​ to ​12 inches (0.2​ to ​0.3 meters) in length. When stretched to full length, the whip could be up to 20 feet (6.1 meters) in length. An optional tassel of horsehair or twine on the end (called a cracker) amplified the sound of the whip. The average weighed around 2 pounds (0.91 kilograms).</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>The whip was mostly effective against unarmored creatures. The weapon had an effective range of 15 feet (4.6 meters). Whips could also be used to trip opponents and they were particularly good at disarming. However, it took special training and practice to use a whip effectively without hurting oneself.</p>
