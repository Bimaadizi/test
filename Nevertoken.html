<p>A nevertoken was an enchanted item developed as trading tokens for Halruaan families before later being adopted as badges of recognition carried by members of the Soft Claws , given to them by the dragon Zundaerazylym .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Zundaerazylym's nevertokens were identical, smooth, glossy, silver-blue metal stars with four blunted points, about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) thick and 4 inches (10 centimeters) across. They were relatively light. They had a tiny hole in the center to allow a chain or strap to be tied around them. They were made of some unknown durable alloy. When they broke, they usually burst into flames and crumbled to dust within seconds. They produced a pleasant sound and a particular chord when struck, which was one way to identify whether they were authentic.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Their origins were unknown, and creating new ones would probably require extensive experimentation. They were previously Halruaan family trading tokens, and many early Halruaan families owned similar items, though newer families did not. Zundaerazylym was given a cache of more than a hundred of them in Year of the Watching Cold, 1320 DR by Ensible Mritavvalan , the dying last member of their family.</p>
