<p>Aunrae Nasadra was the matron mother of House Nasadra and the uncrowned queen of Ched Nasad until its fall in the year 1372 DR . According to the House's tradition many of the direct line were named 'Aunrae'.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 689 DR , Aunrae succeeded her grandmother as head of House Nasadra and informally as queen of Ched Nasad. In time, her power over the city became absolute, unmatched even by Yvonnel Baenre of Menzoberranzan .</p>
<p>In 1372 DR , however, during the Silence of Lolth , fighting between House Zauvirr and House Melarn escalated with the participation of the duergar mercenary band Clan Xornbane , secretly manipulated by the Jaezred Chaulssin patron Zammzt . Soon, the duergar stonefire threatened the very existence of the city.</p>
<p>Thus Ssipriina Zauvirr and four other powerful matron mothers ( Umrae D'Dgttu , Nedylene Zinard , Ulviirala Rilynt , and Shi Neerune Hlaund ) summoned a humongous black guardian spider . However, the guardian spider (and soon another guardian spider it summoned) was never in their telepathic control, as the artifacts were divine artifacts tied to the power of Lolth, and they began raging through the city, further compounding the chaos. Eventually, the entire city fell into the chasm in smoke and flames, marking the end of the great days of Ched Nasad.</p>
