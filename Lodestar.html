<p>Lodestar was a creature found in the Demi-Plane of Electromagnetism . It appeared as a 4‑foot (1.2‑meter) globe with a dim gray glow and a bright white center.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>These creatures dwelt within the Demi-Plane of Electromagnetism and occasionally commanded squads of shockers , communicating with them telepathically. Though incapable of dealing physical damage through strikes, they exerted powerful magnetic fields affecting all ferrous metal within 20 yd (18 m) Metal armor would impede movement, and wielders of metal weapons found their attacks hindered. If the lodestone was destroyed, any accompanying aerial servant would immediately flee.</p>
