<p>Ashhold was an ash giant citadel in the Black Ash Plain . The citadel's fortifications were entirely natural and consisted of huge basalt pillars with lava pits and flows.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ashhold was considered a holy land by ash giants, and thus a neutral ground between their tribes.</p>
<p>In 1479 DR , the green dragon Skuthosiin took control of the citadel and used its influence to control the ash giants tribes, and launched a campaign to conquer former Untheric lands, including Tymanther . After the wizard Biri uncovered Skuthosiin as the true mastermind of the giants, Vanquisher Tarhun ordered a joint military operation with all the tymatheran military forces and led a siege to Ashhold. In the ensuing battle, the dragonborn killed Skuthosiin, ending the giant threat to Tymanther.</p>
