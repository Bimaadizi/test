<p>Sharra , who was nicknamed Sharra of the Invisible Dragon , was an archmage who inhabited the city of Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sharra was famous for rousing the city of Neverwinter by using her magic so that every citizen in the city heard her warning when Calishite forces attempted a surprise attack a night. When she was still an apprentice in Waterdeep she blasted down a building in an escape when she got caught between rival wizards slinging spells at each other. The alley where she blasted the building was later called Sharra's Flight .</p>
