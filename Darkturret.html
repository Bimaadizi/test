<p>Darkturret was a ruined castle located on the banks of the River Orlaphar in Gontal . Because it was exposed to the Spellplague , the ruins of Darkturret existed outside time and space.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>As a place that existed outside time and space, the castle could shift through time, trapping within its ruins creatures and adventurers from any time period of either Abeir and Toril . The ghosts of the members of the Garrandar family were also trapped forever in Darkturret.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Darkturret was originally built long ago by a unnamed wizard to serve as its home. After being affected by the Spellplague, the original site was removed from normal time and space. In 1429 DR , members of the Garrandar family commissioned the construction of a castle in the ruins of the original Darkturret, and since nobody knew anything about the original site or the wizard who build it, historical records credited the Garrandars for building the place.</p>
<p>It was believed the Garrandars used the place to hide wealth stolen from other Twelvefold families. The other families joined forces and swiftly attacked and destroyed Darkturret in revenge. The ruined stronghold became a haunted place inhabited by terrible undead and other monsters from the Glaur Barrens and other places and time periods of Abeir and Toril.</p>
