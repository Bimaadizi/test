<p>The Orrery of the Inner Planes was an enchanted mechanical object, the origin of which was up for debate. Some scholars believed it to be a marid device, while others thought it to be a creation of the cooperative efforts of both the marid and dao , which seemed highly unlikely.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Orrery of the Inner Planes looked like a large clock.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The orrery showed the relative positions of the planets, moons, and stars, as well as the junctions of the Inner Planes . In the hands of a competent navigator, the orrery could be used to travel between all of the Inner planes, including all Elemental planes , the Ethereal plane , and the Prime Material Plane .</p>
<p>Any ship with the orrery mounted on deck could traverse all of the elements, gliding through solid stone, "sailing" underwater, etc . Additionally, the orrery protected both the vessel and all passengers from adverse elemental effects. A ship on the Prime plane could even levitate with the orrery on board.</p>
<p>Incompetent navigators who attempted to use the orrery often wound up on dangerous planes of existence instead of their intended destination.</p>
