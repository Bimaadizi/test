<table border='1'><tr><th>Type</th><td>Writing script</td></tr></table><br>
<p>Davek was a runic script used by the Dwarven and Giant languages of worlds such as Nerath and Eberron . It was used to a much lesser extent for Dwarven on Toril , where Dethek was widespread.</p>
<h2>Writing</h2>
<p>Only those who were versed in Dethek could distinguish Davek from it. Most human commoners, having only a passing familiarity with Dethek, would just recognize Davek script as looking vaguely Dwarvish. If they made an actual effort to try reading Davek script, they would conclude that its words were nonsensical.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This dwarven script originated on another world, likely Nerath, where it was developed to transcribe Dwarven. The Giant language came to use it following the dwarves' long servitude to the giants there.</p>
<p>Over time, planar travelers from these other worlds brought to Toril books written in Davek, items labeled with it, and some knowledge of it until it began to be known on Toril.</p>
<p>One group introduced to this alphabet were the dwarves of Ammarindar , who at least partially inscribed their special stepping disks with the script.</p>
