<p>The Deepwash was a freshwater lake and, as of 1370 â€“ 1372 DR , the largest lake in the Vilhon Reach . The northwestern stretch was known as Shalane Lake in Erlkazar .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Deepwash lake was almost as deep as Lake Esmel in Amn . It was filled by tributaries from the Cloven Mountains (such as Arglander River ) and the Deepwing Mountains , and by Shalane River flowing from the icecold Impresk Lake . The lake's main outlet was the Wintercloak River . The Deepwash was known to be filled with fish. Fishing was safest in the Shalane Lake region, because a huge dragon turtle residing in the Deepwash did not enter those waters as often.</p>
<p>The Shalane Lake stretch formed part of the eastern border of the barony of Shalanar in Erlkazar , and the whole of the lake served as the northern border of Ahlarkhem .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The lake was very deep and was home to a very large dragon turtle, with a shell 30 feet (10 meters) in diameter, who resided near the lizardfolk city of Surkh . In Surkh, the dragon turtle was highly respected, and some even worshiped it, believing it to be an honor to be killed and eaten by it. The turtle was large enough to capsize ships and had a very high intelligence.</p>
