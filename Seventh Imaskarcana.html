<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Seventh Imaskarcana resembled a large, golden key.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Seventh Imaskarcana held the entire body of Imaskari knowledge about creating permanent extradimensional spaces. It likely had other powers as well; those probably put it in line with the powers and abilities of the First Imaskarcana and Fifth Imaskarcana , as well as probably the Third Imaskarcana .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Seventh Imaskarcana was created under the orders of Lord Omanond in −3891 DR .</p>
<p>It may have been rediscovered by a priest of Bhaal, named Tyaral , from a ruin known as Maskana . The ruin was an outpost, which had been built atop an abandoned Imaskari complex razed by the Mulan slaves during their revolt. The Imaskari in the complex took all their books and valuables before abandoning it, but an earlier cohort of artificers had secretly hidden the Seventh Imaskarcana there, so that the inhabitants of the complex could serve as unwitting guards.</p>
