<p>Spite Harrowdale was a thousand-year-old archmage who posed as a 12-year-old apprentice mage in the magical academy of Dweomercore during the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Spite was extremely intelligent; he was fluent in a number of languages and possessed great talent as a practitioner of the Art .</p>
<p>He appeared as a young Rashemi boy who demonstrated typical magical skill for someone that age. He owed his youthful appearance to regular imbibing of potions of longevity .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Spite viewed the "Mad Mage" Halaster Blackcloak as a superior magical power and wanted to learn as much as he could from the similarly ancient wizard. He viewed his time in Undermountain as a grand adventure.</p>
<p>While enrolled in Dweomercore, Spite came to realize that the headmaster of the academy was not actually Halaster Blackcloak, but rather an arcanaloth assuming his form. Spite maintained a similar deception, demonstrating competence in only the most basic spells to maintain his ruse of being a pre-adolescent magic student. Unlike Spite's classmates, the arcanaloth saw through the archmage's deceit as well and kept a close eye on his activities.</p>
<p>While he was enrolled within the academy, in the late 15 th century DR, Spite sought to steal Halaster Blackcloak's personal spellbook .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The archmage was accompanied by an oni mage named Kumar who, like Spite, altered their appearance to that of a half-orc woman named "Dumara". Kumar saw Spite as an older brother figure, while the archmage felt that the oni was his only true confidant.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Within his personal dormitory, Spite kept the two volumes of his spellbooks, the Spells of Spite . They were hidden within a Leomund's secret chest , in a room protected by a glyph of warding .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before he joined the academy of Dweomercore, during the 14 th century DR . Spite lived in Undermountain within the realm of Wyllowwood . He met Kumar after the oni had found his way into Trobriand's Graveyard by means of a portal , and the two spent their time creating magical traps that caught interlopers who dared trespass into the deeper layers of Undermountain.</p>
<p>He and Kumar made their home within a set of ruins nestled into an isle in the middle of the River of the Depths . In addition to his room, he had a small laboratory and holding cells that housed the subjects of his arcane experimentation.</p>
