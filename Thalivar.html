<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in the late 13 th century DR, Thalivar built his tower in the middle of Leilon on the Sword Coast North . It served as the center for the wizard's magical research. The tower was fitted with a planar beacon , which lured extraplanar creatures toward it, and special holding cells that could then be used to capture these creatures. However, upon Thalivar's discovery of a Netherese artifact called the Ruinstone in the ethereal plane, a wild magic surge disabled the protective wards keeping his captured test subjects docile. The creatures broke free, damaged the beacon, and collapsed part of the tower onto the wizard, killing him. However, Thalivar's spirit remained bound to his tower.</p>
<p>Thalivar's tower was torn down in the midâ€“1480s DR on the orders of Lord Protector Dagult Neverember of Neverwinter . The tower was cleared of the dangers within and then rebuilt by Neverwintan soldiers under the supervision of the mage Gallio Elibro . Once the tower finally became safe for people to enter, Thalivar's ghost began possessing Gallio, taking control of him during nights in order to continue his old planar research. Neither Gallio nor Thalivar were actually aware of this arrangement, with the former believing he was simply having restless sleep and the latter believing he was still alive but trapped in a nightmare in which his tower was in ruins. A group of adventurers laid Thalivar's ghost to rest, freeing Gallio from his possession and allowing him to continue his research.</p>
