<p>Fyerdetha's Discourses on Power was a treatise scroll on the topic of supernatural power and its sources, written and published sometime before the destruction of the city of Phlan in the beginning of the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A copy of Fyerdetha's Discourses on Power was left in Mantor's Library in the city of Phlan as the city fell into ruins during a Rage of Dragons of the Year of Thunder, 1306 DR . The Heroes of Phlan came across the scroll in the library's philosophy section in the Year of the Lion, 1340 DR , during the campaign to liberate the Old City from its master â€“ Tyranthraxus . The treatise also shed some light on the mysterious pool of radiance from which the Possessing Spirit drew strength.</p>
