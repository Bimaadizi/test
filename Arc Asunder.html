<p>Arc Asunder were a type of enchanted halberds that possessed magics that dealt death electricity damage to their targets.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Arc Asunder possessed a +1 enchantment and arced electricity onto its targets upon a successful strike. Additionally, the weapons increased the wielder's ability to parry attacks and glowed with blue light, illuminating 10 feet (3 meters) around it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These enchanted halberds were thought to have originated from the great wastes of the Anauroch desert. Sages believed that the electricity that enchanted Arc Asunder came from heavy thunderstorms that ravaged the region's air. The original creator likely wanted the weapons to be as dangerous as the Great Sand Sea itself.</p>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR , Arc Asunder weapons could be found in the city of Neverwinter on the Sword Coast North as well as the Market Triangle in Westgate .</p>
