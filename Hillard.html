<p>Hillard was a Captain of the Purple Dragons of Cormyr in the late 15 th century DR , who was stationed in the prison-town of Wheloon .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1485 DR , Captain Hillard was in charge of manning the defenses of the walls surrounding the prison city of Wheloon when the Shadowfell Nexus overlapped with the docks, depositing a small army of living shadows and enraged prisoners amidst the shocked Cormyrean forces. After the attack was repelled and a War Wizard brought down the magical barriers separating the docks from the wall, Hillard speculated on the goal of the attackâ€”only to realize that the target was the Sharran prisoner Dedryk Black , who was being held for questioning in the magistrate's office. Indeed, the attack was a distraction for the shadar-kai assassin Teralyn to slay Magistrate Cornelius Latrimor and send Dedryk and other Sharran prisoners to freedom through the Shadowfell .</p>
