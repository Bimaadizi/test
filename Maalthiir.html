<p>Maalthiir was a merchant and a wizard who came to rule the city of Hillsfar in the Moonsea in the 14 th and 15 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When Maalthiir was middle-aged, he was a tall, thin man with a crinkled face. He maintained a shaved scalp, but allowed stubble to grow on it and wore a long dark-gray goatee beard.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Maalthiir was a greedy, sadistic individual who had a distinct devotion to mercantile power. He regularly arranged for random executions and torture within his realm.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Maalthiir was noted as carrying a scepter with him. It was made of some dark metal and its head was the shape of a draconic claw.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Maalthiir was noted as having a single friend from before his rise to power: Wak Rathar .</p>
<p>Maalthiir fostered a wizard apprentice, Mordak Brelliar , who acted as Maalthiir's chief advisor and second-in-command. Mordak intended to overthrow Maalthiir and foster an alliance with Zhentil Keep to rule the Moonsea by getting as close to him as possible, a plot of which Maalthiir was well aware.</p>
<p>In the first decade of Maalthiir's rule, rumors linked him romantically with a priestess of Umberlee named Dualah . After the marriage of Selfaril Uoumdolphin and Dmitra Flass , Maalthiir and Tola Vrass , the Khazark of Hillsfar's Thayan enclave began to court each other.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Maalthiir was formerly a member of Hillsfar's city council. Then, in the winter of 1356 / 57 DR , Maalthiir overthrew the potentially corrupt Council of Hillsfar using blackmail and threats of harm.</p>
<p>When the City of Shade began attacking its neighbors in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Maalthiir allied with his longtime foes, the Zhentarim and, even more shockingly, with the daemonfey of House Dlardrageth to fight in the Dalelands against the army of Seiveril Miritar . Maalthiir eventually betrayed House Dlardrageth by refusing to march his forces against Shadowdale and the daemonfey responded with overwhelming force, causing Maalthiir to flee Hillsfar and go into hiding.</p>
<p>Maalthiir returned twelve years later, retaking his place as First Lord and sending all of the nonhumans who'd moved to the city during his absence to the city's arena.</p>
<p>Eight years later, in the Year of the Secret, 1396 DR , Maalthiir, who feared the increasing power of Myth Drannor , created a puppet council that included elves and half-elves and relaxed his xenophobic policies outside the city proper, hoping to prevent an incursion from the City of Song.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Malachite Shadows, 1460 DR , Maalthiir attempted to make the transformation into undeath as a lich . His attempt went awry however, and he died.</p>
