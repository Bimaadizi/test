<p>Wilders were a tradition of psionics users that drew upon raw emotion and passion to fuel and trigger their abilities. Within the scope of psionic traditions, wilders stood as opposites to the disciplined and meditative psions , though the two drew from the same well of psionic powers.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Wilders and psions were among the most commonly found form of psionics users in the Realms. Among human regions, they most frequently arose in areas that were built overtop of the ruins of ancient psionic civilizations. This included the Vilhon Reach , where the psiocracy of Jhaamdath once stood, and anywhere that stood above duergar or illithid cities. Wilders could also frequently be found in areas with strong wild psionic fluctuations. Other regions where wilders could commonly be found included the Shaar .</p>
<p>In contrast to psions, wielders of the Invisible Art that largely required some form of schooling to further unlock their psionic powers, the abilities of a wilder were always innate and required no schooling, making most largely self-taught. However, not all eschewed academics, for in the mid-1370s DR at least two of the instructors at the College of the Eclipse in Riatavin were wilders, and many wilders received training in Skullport 's Hall of Mental Splendor to become cognition thieves .</p>
<p>Often times, wilders arose from those who were left on their own for extended periods during childhood, sometimes forced by outside circumstances to live in the wilderness. When returned to civilization, such wilders would often strive to impress others with their psionics in an effort to ameliorate the many years they had spent in solitude.</p>
<p>Their desire to use the Invisible Art was often paramount, though a wilder would not turn down currency or items that could potentially enhance their abilities.</p>
<p>Wilders were more likely to spring up among humans than any other race. Elves , gnomes , and halflings were usually incapable of putting themselves in the emotional moment required for wilders to trigger psionic abilities, though those among the ghostwise halflings who displayed psionic powers had no such difficulties and often chose to follow this tradition. Some rebellious dwarves found the way of the wilder appealing. And the tradition was overall similar to the culture of half-giants . When raised in communities where their kind was sparse, blue goblins were liable to take up the path of a wilder. And some aboleths developed themselves as wilders.</p>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>Wilders were often too focused on themselves to devote themselves to the philosophy of a deity or organized religion.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>For most of the general populace in the Realms, psionics and wilders alike were unrecognized or barely understood, often confusing them with traditional spellcasters of magic. Consequently, a commoner 's view of a wilder could differ little from their attitude and reactions towards arcane spellcasters, which in many cases could mean a sense of distrust</p>
<p>Among the other traditions of psionics, psions were often distrustful of them due to their philosophical differences and soulknives were somewhat uncomfortable around them, but wilders themselves were amicable towards interacting with all sorts of users of the Invisible Art.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>This tradition of psionics users were found to run the whole gamut of alignments . They were typically rather adventurous, turbulent, somewhat impatient, and above all eager to utilize their psionic powers. They delighted in interacting with others and the undertaking dangerous quests, as both were ideal opportunities to use and showcase their powers.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Wilders manifested their powers through the sheer force and passion of their emotions, the abilities growing more powerful the greater a wilder's passion towards whatever they were doing. Unlike wizards , who had to prepare their spells , a wilder's psionic powers were ingrained within their mind and thus always at the ready.</p>
<p>Early into their psionic development, wilders acquired such acute intuition that they became deftly aware of touch-based attacks and were capable of avoiding them with ease.</p>
<p>Due to their temperamental personalities, wilders struggled with the use of powers from the telepathy discipline. This difficulty with using telepathic powers became amplified for a wilder as their mastery of psionic powers improved. However, those who undertook training to become cognition thieves overcame this mental block.</p>
<h3>Wild Surge</h3>
<p>Through the fervor in which they pursued the use of their powers, wilders developed a unique ability to wild surge . This was a literal surging manifestation of their psionic powers, far beyond what they were normally capable of, making their emotions rise to the surface. A wilder could trigger this whenever they manifested a power, however, every use of wild surge had potential to psychically strain the wilder, what was known as a psychic enervation . Thus, wilders stood at risk of injuring themselves through careless use of the power.</p>
<p>In time, wilders developed a sense of euphoria while wild surging that could improve their general capabilities within combat.</p>
