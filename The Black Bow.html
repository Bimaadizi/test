<p>The Black Bow was a powerful enchanted longbow and a weapon of vengeance thought to be blessed by Tyr , Hoar , or Bhaal .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Black Bow was a quite ordinary, crudely made, and dusty weapon in appearance.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The bow possessed a powerful +3 enchantment that dealt powerful damage, guided its arrows toward the target, and increased the movement speed of the shooter's hands.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Black Bow was created at some point before the late 13 th century DR by Jonan of Suzail , a retired soldier and a Cormyrean settler of the Western Heartlands . Jonan spent years campaigning for the Dragon Throne and eventually saved enough to marry his childhood beloved and settle a new plot of land. They built a home and a humble farm to the north of Baldur's Gate and east of the Trollbark Forest . Five years later, the farm and all its neighbors were ransacked and torched to the ground by a gang of raiders. Jonan's wife and child both died in the raid.</p>
<p>Weeks into his grief and rage, Jonan crafted the The Black Bow by hand and rubbed the weapon with the ashes of his dead family, creating a powerful tool of vengeance. The Black Bow ended up slaying every single raider and every person who's ever done business or consorted with the bandits.</p>
<p>Sages speculated on the topic of how the The Black Bow gained its enchantments. Some believed that it happened only after the veteran's death and the weapon was blessed by Tyr, Hoar, and some even claimed that Bhaal has a hand in the weapon's enchantment. The theory depended heavily on who thought Jonan's actions to be justice, vengeance, or murder.</p>
<p>Over time this weapon changed hands until ending up in possession of the blacksmith Conlan in Kuldahar in the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR .</p>
