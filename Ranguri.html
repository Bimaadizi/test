<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time in the early 8 th century DR , the Kuong deserted the capital at Parmahana and made an exodus through the jungle, founding a temporary capital at Beradandar , before moving on to the permanent capital at Ranguri.</p>
<p>From Ranguri, the priest-kings turned their attention north, conquering fresh territories and making their first incursion into the southern jungles of Laothan , building their empire.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ranguri was a city of stone, from its temples and palaces to its flagstoned streets lit by torches. It was also a city of water, with running water available in the palaces and public facilities and an extensive system of canals. These were used for travel around the city and to drain excessive water, as the city flooded heavily in the rainy season.</p>
<p>The core of the city was an interconnected complex of palaces and temples that was big enough to be a town in its own right. From here, the kingdom's bureaucracy and temples were managed in detail.</p>
<h2>Organizations</h2>
<p>The Jarvatya , a formidable jinyan crime family, were based in Ranguri.</p>
