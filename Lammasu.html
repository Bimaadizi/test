<p>A lammasu ( pronounced : /ˈ l ɑː m ɑː s uː / LA-ma-soo ) was a noble and stern magical beast that looked like a cross between a lion and an eagle . Lammasus sought to promote goodness throughout the world, living in isolated ruins and abandoned temples.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A lammasu had the body of a lion , the wings of a giant eagle , and the face of a human . They were capable of flight.</p>
<p>The average lammasu measured 8 feet (2.4 meters) in length and weighed about 500 pounds (230,000 grams).</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Lammasus were creatures who preferred isolation but concerned themselves with the well-being of good creatures in general. Their outwardly stern demeanor belied their capacity for compassion. They were cordial in nature towards other good creatures and were often willing to assist them in combating evil . They would almost always join a fight if a good creature was in danger. According to some they would attack evil creatures on sight, while others gave evil creatures a chance to leave their lairs, firmly asking them to go.</p>
<h2>Ability</h2>
<p>According to early scholars, all lammasu possessed an innate ability to turn themselves invisible and dimension door at will. Their bodies also radiated an aura similar to the spell protection from evil, 10' radius . However, later scholars claimed that a lammasu was limited to using greater invisibility on itself up to twice per day and dimension door once per day. They also possessed a limited form of telepathy.</p>
<p>Lammasu could cast divine magic , including spells from the good , healing , knowledge , and law domains. All lammasu knew the spells cure critical wounds and cure serious wounds , whilst only a small percentage of them knew the spell holy word .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Beyond their use of priestly spells, lammasu fought by use of their sharp front claws. In some circumstances, they would use their telepathy to communicate with nearby lammasu to ask for aid.</p>
<h2>Sub-Species</h2>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Lammasu organized themselves in prides, much like lions. Their societies were very structured, reflective of their lawful good nature, and lead by one or two greater lammasu. They worked to keep down the population of evil creatures in their area, often protecting frontier settlements.</p>
<p>Once a month, on the night of a full moon, all pride leaders within a given area would meet up in an event called "the Whitemoon". There they would discuss until dawn how their ongoing efforts to combat evil were going. According to many accounts, their collective presence would cause a bright glow to emanate from their meeting spot.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Lammasu were commonly found on the Prime Material within temperate and warm climates, such as in deserts, where they made their homes in old abandoned temples that they considered themselves to be the guardians of. Their communities were always spread out from each other at a distance of 25 miles (40,000 meters).</p>
<p>In the Gulthmere Forest , lammasu could be found living on the Machran Spire most of the year.</p>
<p>Beyond the Prime Material, lammasu were most commonly found in Mount Celestia , the divine realm of the Pridelands in the Beastlands , and in the divine realm of Merratet , wherein existed a whole village of lammasu. Additionally, both lesser and greater lammasu could also be found within the Ethereal Plane, though only the latter could be encountered in the Astral.</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>In addition to speaking their own language , lammasu commonly spoke the Common Tongue , Celestial , and Draconic . Greater lammasu additionally knew how to speak the limited lawful good tongue .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>These creatures generally harbored a strong emnity towards lamias and manticores , the latter especially as it was not uncommon for those less familiar with lammasu to misidentify them as being manticores.</p>
<p>They served as servants for a variety of different deities across the Realms, including Arvoreen , Cyrrollalee , Horus-Re , Isis , Osiris , Solonor Thelandira , Torm , and Yondalla . They were most strongly associated with Nobanion , who was sometimes depicted as a lammasu himself and whose church considered both lesser and greater lammasu to be members of the clergy.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>A tuft of fur from a lammasu was required as a material component for the Nobanionite spell lionheart .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In −30,700 DR , a number of lammasu defeated a much larger force of Aearee-Krocaa , killing one thousand.</p>
