<p>Dernall Forest was a woodland on the isle of Alaron in the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The forest was a perilous place that was known to become more fey and otherworldly as one traversed deeper into it.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This forest covered a large portion of Callidyrr in central Alaron. The Swanmay River flowed through it from roughly northwest to southeast. It was also traversed north to south by High King's Road . Its northern boundary was the foothills of the Fairheight Range . On the west side was the Drowned Forest and some coastal towns. The eastern border faded into the fields of Talffolk and the southern border was bound by the rolling hills of Stirgewick . Caer Callidyrr , the capital of the Moonshaes, stood on the northeast edge of the forest. The Dernall Forest touched the western border of the Central Plains .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the Dernall Forest was under siege by creatures sent through a rift from the Feywild by Great Gark , the Goblin King of Nachtur . The breach in planar integrity was deep in the heart of the forest and the troops of House Kendrick were hard pressed to repel the growing evil presence.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The woods were patrolled by rangers of Callidyrr, who knew to travel with caution.</p>
<p>By the 1300s DR , the forest had become a dangerous place due to the presence of bandits and outlaws who struck fear even in the hearts of the High King's soldiers. One of these brigand leaders, more honorable than many, was a man named O'Roarke who had been outlawed by High King Reginald Carrathal for voicing his firm conviction that Carrathal was not a legitimate ruler of the Ffolk .</p>
<p>As of the late 1400s DR, creatures reported to be in the forest included fomorians , goblins , werewolves , and worgs . Unseelie fey of the forest were known to lead travelers astray, and sometimes to their deaths. These dark inhabitants threatened the local people of Callidyrr, prompting the druids of the forest to go to battle against them every day. As of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , they were steadily losing ground to the fey.</p>
