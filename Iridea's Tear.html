<p>Iridea's Tear was a magical bracer that was given to Jherek Wolf's-get in order to help him defeat Iakhovas .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Iridea's Tear appeared as a pinkish iridescent bracer that went from the wrist to the elbow. It was as light as a second skin but stronger than steel . If the wielder so wanted it, it would simple fade into the skin, ready to come out again at its owner's whim. It could be willed into different shapes, recreating hooks, daggers , or shields . It also provided magical protection against hostile spells.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Iridea's Tear was a gift that Song Who Brings Bright Rains had prepared for he who was foretold to fight Iakhovas. The whale bard never managed to give it to Jherek in person, as Iakhovas killed him after irrupting into Ser√¥s in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR . Transported by another whale bard, Jherek reached the buoyant rotting body of Song Who Brings Bright Rains and was instructed to cut out Iridea's Tear from his body, as the whale had kept it hidden inside his body. Jherek could not do it, so he tried to mentally call it. Iridescent tendrils jumped out of the whale's flesh, latching onto his arm, shifting into a bracer. Afterwards, the whale bard bonded him with the bracer, which caused him excruciating pain. He survived though, and the bracer accepted him.</p>
<p>Jherek would use the bracer as a means to defend himself and attack, as it could be willed into a weapon , a shield, or as a protective item against magic . It saved Jherek's life when Iakhovas cast a lightning bolt against him.</p>
