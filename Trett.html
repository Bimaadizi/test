<h2>History</h2>
<p>Trett, during one of his travels in 1489 DR , acquired a necklace made from a blue dragon tooth. She decided to sell it to the Ironhanded , Phlan 's Ironworkers' Guild. He met Yanna Hammerbound , a high-ranking member of Ironhanded, at the Madame Freona's Tea Kettle for an exchange. However, a lightning bolt spell from inside the item hit Trett. The situation was resolved by adventurers hired by Buhrell Caah , who wanted the item in order to neutralize it. Trett presumably survived.</p>
