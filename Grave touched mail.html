<p>As of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , a set of grave touched mail was worn by an unidentified corpse buried in a shallow grave just outside the town of Elmwood in the Moonsea .

Whether the item's enchantments were a result of the previous owner's grim fate or came from some enchanted who created the chainmail remained a mystery.</p>
