<p>The Love of Black Bess was a unique enchanted mace dedicated to the Lady of Misfortune, Beshaba .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Love of Black Bess was enhanced with a powerful +3 enchantment as well as Beshaba's divine magics of bad luck. Each successful hit had a chance of taking away the target's luck. Additionally, the mace's creator attached a ring of readiness to the Black Bess . The owner of its twin ring could summon the mace to fly into their hands with a simple command.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Redani , a cruel mage who worshiped Beshaba and lived sometime before the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , was the creator of The Love of Black Bess . Redani was known for two things: her arcane prowess, and her skills of seduction. The magical mace was a regular gift to the woman's new consorts. Every time Redani grew tired of a lover, she gave a new consort the ring of readiness and sent him to slay the predecessor. New paramours always slew their mark with ease. A single word sent The Love of Black Bess flying out of the old lover's hands and into the new one's. Ultimately, Redani's death came from a priest of Hoar , the god of poetic justice. The said priest was Gural of Chessenta , who came across a skull of one of Redani's ex-lovers felled by The Love of Black Bess and embarked on a quest to bring justice to the Beshaban wizardess. Gural animated all of the consorts slain by Redani, ending her cruel existence.</p>
<p>The Love of Black Bess changed hands over time before ending up in possession of the blacksmith Conlan in Kuldahar by 1281 DR .</p>
