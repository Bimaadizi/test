<p>The Nine Sentinels , or Sentinel Towers , were a collection of prominent ancient towers scattered across the Tejarn Hills of southern Amn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Sentinels remained mostly intact despite their great age, outlasting many other Calishite structures long fallen to ruin. They were built as simple outposts with small garrisons, with a signal-fire brazier and mirror atop used to communicate with their neighbors.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Nine Sentinels were roughly evenly spaced across the length of the Tejarn Hills, from just above the Tethir Road near Brost in the west to the eastern edge beyond Hillfort Keshla .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Sentinels were built during the Third Age of Calimshan ( −1900 DR to −900 DR ), as part of a chain of army garrisons and signal towers scattered across the hills of what was then the wild frontier of the Ralamnish Ridings , linked by the South Road . The signal network was later joined with the city of Xandar in the Small Teeth , finished in 250 DR .</p>
<p>As the fortunes of Calimshan waxed and waned, the majority of these structures fell to ruin and disappeared into the rocky hills, but nine towers stubbornly remained over more than two-thousand years. Their original names were long lost, but gained new ones from an Amnian bard who titled each one in a song about the ghostly signals of the "Nine Sentinels."</p>
