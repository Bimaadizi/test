<p>Grimvalda was a member of Clan Ironvein , a family of hill dwarves renowned throughout Battledale , and the head chef of the outlaw keep Vulture's Roost in the Dalelands in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Grimvalda typically dressed in a vest woven of gold threads and a pair of loose-fitting pants that were trimmed with gemstones . She also had copies of the keys to all of the stronghold's doors.</p>
<p>Within the hidden compartment of her bedroom's trunk, Grimvalda kept a small pouch of gold pieces and a sketch of her husband within a copper picture frame.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Grimvalda lived and worked in Vulture's Roost as part of the household servants alongside her brother Starnbrow Ironvein , their niece, Dunrain , and nephew Dezivan . Within the mansion-like estate, she shared the eastern living quarters with Dunrain.</p>
<p>Though her brother Starnbrow was the head of the servants, Grimvalda was the lord and sovereign of the keep's kitchen. They all worked eighteen- bell shifts, waking up five bells after midnight and retiring to their quarters one bell before midnight. On occasion, they spent quality "family time" together within the manor's private dining room, a room that they otherwise went into to have private meals alongside their employer and her two trusted lieutenants, the half-orcs Darok and Szorp .</p>
<p>Along with the lieutenants and other servants, Grimvalda had special permission to enter the war room of Vulture's Roost without prior authorization.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She was married to a man by the name of Daltagar , who ran a dwarven alehouse in the Sembian city of Yhaunn .</p>
<p>Grimvalda and her family were treated well by the warlord Aleta "the Vulture" Vanmarwin and their counsel was trusted in all nonmilitary matters. To her, they were the closest thing she had to a family. Though they recognized she was far from perfect, Grimvalda and the others were dutifully loyal to Aleta. Unlike all other residents of Vulture's Roost, she and the other Ironveins would only ever refer to her as "Lady Vanmarwin", never as her persona "the Vulture".</p>
<p>Like many dwarves, they took pride in their work. They believed Aleta was worthy of respect and took umbrage with anyone that questioned her hospitality and with any unwelcomed intruders that defied her. And in times of need they would rally around in her defense, brandishing clubs .</p>
<p>As her employer had a taste for gourmet food, a considerable amount of funds were spent towards supplying Grimvalda and her kitchen with both rare ingredients and rare, hard-to-find recipes. She was even given access to nine leather -bound cookbooks that Aleta had compiled herself.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the Harper spies Elariel Taias and Kimach Taias were discovered in the vicinity of Vulture's Roost, shadowing a patrol of the Vulture's brigands. They managed to capture Kimach, but only wounded Elariel before she fled deep into the woods, eventually escaping into Eoghan's grove. The titular treant Eoghan , a longtime ally of the Harpers, provided Elariel shelter and managed to convince some dryad allies to create false trails leading away from the grove. As hoped, her pursuers eventually gave up on looking for Elariel and returned to Vulture's Roost with their sole captive.</p>
<p>With a member of the Harpers in captivity, over the coming week the Vulture invited the Zhent warmage Toren Witherfield and his envoy of representatives to Vulture's Roost, planning a grand feast and to present Kimach before them as an offering. Aleta Vanmarwin hoped that this would be just what she needed to further solidify her worth in the eyes of the Zhentarim and securing their aid in expanding her influence over Battledale and Tasseldale . She also believed that this would serve to fan the flames of the conflict between the Harpers and the Zhents, keeping them distracted from her own activities, and consequently through their conflict drive more hamlets and villages into seeking protection under her.</p>
<p>Aleta and her servants prepared an extravagant feast for her guests of seven entr√©es. They set the feast hall's table with magnificent sets of gold dinnerware for sixteen people, fragile crystal wineglasses and decanters , and silver candelabras . On the expected day of the feast, Grimvalda and the other dwarves worked tirelessly to have everything prepared.</p>
