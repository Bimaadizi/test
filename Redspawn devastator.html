<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Redspawn devastators attacked with their fangs, sometimes flinging opponents around.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Redspawn devastators were powerful, rivalling true dragons in might, but they were still little more than beasts. They were few in number. Devastators typically lived in remote areas, and their hunting grounds were littered with scorched bones.</p>
