<p>The Isle of Gargantuas was one of the Outer Isles of Wa in Kara-Tur and home to gigantic monsters, called gargantuas .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The island was often rent by volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, which devastated the landscape. The air was humid, bearing the stink of sulfur and coal and dense with explosions. Deep granite pits dotted the island, forming traps for the gargantuas.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around Wa Year 1765 (1347 DR) , two krakentua had a titanic battle with more powerful spirits of the ocean. Badly wounded, they escaped to the Isle of Gargantuas to heal and recuperate. One krakentua stayed to rule the island and its monsters by Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR) , while the other went to the Fochu Peninsula , seeking humans to worship her.</p>
<p>Around Wa Year 1776 (1358 DR) , the second krakentua would inflict a vision of a battle on the Isle of Gargantuas on adventurers who visited her at Shinkintin .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The insectoid and reptilian gargantuas battled each other relentlessly. There were also humanoid gargantuas , who also got in on the action.</p>
<p>They were ruled over by a krakentua, who contented himself with watching their never-ending conflicts and developed a plan to recruit and train an army of gargantuas and attack southern Wa.</p>
<h2>Wildlife</h2>
<p>The rare and prized blue mandarin duck could be found on the Isle of Gargantuas, among other inconveniently hazardous locales.</p>
