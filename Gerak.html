<p>Gerak was a hunter in Sembia in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gerak lived in the small village of Fairelm in Shadovar -dominated Sembia with his wife Elle .</p>
<p>He was conscripted into some of the Shadovar's wars against Cormyr but always went back.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Awakened Sleepers, 1484 DR , Elle announced to Gerak that she had finally become pregnant. Therefore, he decided to go hunting to support his growing family. When he returned, however, Gerak found all Fairelm's inhabitants slaughtered and Elle with a curse upon her. This was the work of Sayeed and Zeeahd .</p>
<p>Later, Vasen Cale and his squad, together with Orsin , came to help.</p>
<p>After witnessing the corruption and death of Elle, Gerak decided to join Vasen's party hoping to have vengeance.</p>
<p>After helping to rescue Mask , Drasek Riven ultimately gave his dogs to Gerak since he could not take them where he must go and advised Gerak to stop drinking his sorrows away and to live despite the horror he had faced. Gerak agreed to take the dogs and promised to give up on drinking.</p>
