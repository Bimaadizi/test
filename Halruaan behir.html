<p>The Halruaan behir was the smaller, more magical cousin of the serpentine behir .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like all behir, the Halruaan variety had the appearance of an elongated crocodile with over a dozen legs and brilliantly-colored scales adorned with many horns. This sub-species was about half as long, and were less-than-half as heavy. They were also selectively bred as pets, with breeders choosing to emphasize traits of unique coloration and the sheen of their scales.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Due to selective breeding, Halruaan behirs were noticeably less intelligent than the larger breed.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Because hatchlings were trained not to bite or constrict their handlers, these behir relied on their electric breath weapon to defend themselves from predators. This was noticeably more potent than other varieties. They would also release a static discharge from their body when agitated.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>Halruaan behirs were often kept as guardians, occasionally as pets and even more rarely for sport fighting. This activity was looked-down upon but not exactly considered illegal. People would often put muzzles on them that were made of leather and electrum .</p>
