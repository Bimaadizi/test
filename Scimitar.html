<p>The scimitar ( pronounced : /ˈ s ɪ m ɪ t ɑːr / SIM-i-tar ) was a one-handed, martial melee weapon of the sword family.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The scimitar was similar to the falchion in that it was a "backsword", sharpened on one edge and the other edge was thicker to give it strength. Scimitar blades were 2​ to ​3 feet (0.61​ to ​0.91 meters) long and almost always curved, though a few were angled like a khopesh . Starting at the hilt, the blade might taper gradually to a point or might increase in width and then rapidly come to a point. The hilt was one-handed and had quillons .</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>Scimitars did not have the damaging power of longswords or other heavier swords, but with skill they could hit vital areas better than most. Using the one-sided, curved scimitar required special training and was therefore classified as a martial weapon.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Scimitars first became available in the Netheril Empire in 1800 NY (−2059 DR) . They had developed from the khopesh, which were created a thousand years prior. During this time scimitars were primarily utilized by drow .</p>
<p>In later centuries, these blades were commonly favored by Calishites and some druids .</p>
