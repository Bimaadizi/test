<p>Cirotralech was an obscure primordial who slept in the caves beneath the section of Howling Mountains located in Fimbrul , Laerakond .</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>It was believed that Cirotralech had multiple heads. At least one was made of fire, and another of ice.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Cirotralech was entombed in Fimbrul alongside his consort, a titan known as the Bride , and his other servants. In the Present Age , nobody save for a small band of mad cultists remembered the existence of this primordial, and all records about it had disappeared as well.</p>
<p>In 1480 DR , a small cult of those madmen, known as the Sons of Winter , led by the scholar Rathloff , attempted to awaken Cirotralech, and there is a possibility that they may have succeeded.</p>
