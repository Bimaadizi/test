<p>Spelt was a grain-producing grass found in Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Spelt was cultivated for its grain in ancient Netheril alongside wheat , bran , timothy , oats , and rye .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Spelt was affected by the wheat rust blight, which destroyed the plants and their grains during the time of Netheril. The spreading disease was cured in 3165 NY (−694 DR) by the arcanist Candlemas , who used a complex combination of magics to propagate a cure and save the crops.</p>
