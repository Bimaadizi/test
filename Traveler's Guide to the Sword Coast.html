<p>Traveler's Guide to the Sword Coast was a many-volume collection of travel guides dedicated to the Sword Coast area of Faerûn , published sometime before 1492 DR .</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<h3>Volume IV: The Risen Road</h3>
<p>The fourth section of the Traveler's Guide spoke of the Risen Road , the route that connected the cities of Baldur's Gate and Elturel , which ran parallel to the River Chionthar . It stated the road was a preferred alternative for those that did not wish to travel by river barge.</p>
<p>It highlighted some notable landmarks that could be found along the road, including the grand temple of Selûne , the nearby village of Moonhaven , and Moonrise Towers .</p>
<h3>Volume VIII: The Outer City</h3>
<p>The eighth section of the book discussed the Outer City of Baldur's Gate. It detailed the numerous industries that helped keep the city running, but were deemed too unpleasant to be housed within the city's walls.</p>
<p>The author shared their opinion that any upstanding travelers should not spend too much time in the Outer City. Even the Lower City was a preferable place to spend one's time.</p>
<h3>Volume IX: Inns and Guesthouses</h3>
<p>The section of the tome that talked about travelers' accommodation in the city of Baldur's Gate mentioned several establishments of note. The Blade and Stars was one of the inns mentioned. The guide informed travelers of the inn's easy-to-spot signage depicting a wooden shield , with a curved blade against a background of stars. It was a welcoming and quite inn that served somewhat plain grub but offered clean lodgings.</p>
<p>Another inn in the guide was the famed Blushing Maiden Inn . The guide warned visitors of its boisterous atmosphere of revelry that lasted into the night. Its namesake was a large wooden mermaid displayed to the establishment's patrons. Lastly, Elfsong Tavern received a limited entry as a dimly-lit inn known for its ghostly singing elven maid and its proprietor named Alan .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, some copies of these volumes were in heavy everyday use. Some of the copies found in the wild suffered damage from elements, rough use, and age. Some were missing covers and binding altogether and had hand-written notes by the books' previous owners.</p>
