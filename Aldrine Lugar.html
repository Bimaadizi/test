<p>Aldrine Lugar was a somewhat famous sailor who survived being stranded on a small island in the Sea of Swords and floated back to Daggerford on a giant gourd, which later came to be known as the Castaway Gourd .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Aldrine Lugar's ship was caught in a storm. She ended up being swept off deck and woke up on a small rocky island. The island was almost barren, lacking any means of survival, apart from some blueberry plants. The sailor consumed all the berries within the first couple of days and soon resigned to her fate of starving to death alone. The only company on the island she had were fluttering colorful butterflies that she came to see as a symbol of freedom. Her salvation was washed ashore one nightâ€”a giant floating gourd from the swamps of the Lizard Marsh . Aldrine knew of the Marsh's lizardfolk and their enormous gourd flask and decided to tempt the good graces of Umberlee . She carved the word "butterfly" on the colorful gourd, attached herself with vines from the island, and set off into the Sea of Swords. Three days later, she found herself washed ashore not far from the Delimbiyr River 's neck.</p>
<p>Eventually, Aldrine Lugar's tale became popular among seafarring folk of Daggerford, and the famous gourd was proudly displayed in Torleth's Treasures , the curio shops of Gillian's Hill circa 1372 DR .</p>
