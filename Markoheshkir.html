<p>Markoheshkir was a powerful, enchanted quarterstaff imbued with elemental energy by the goddess Kereska , allowing its wielder to harness her power.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Markoheshkir seemed to be made of some metallic substance. It glowed with a yellow-orange light. The top of the quarterstaff was decorated with a dragon made of some kind of metal.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>In addition to serving as a formidable bludgeoning weapon and reliable walking support, Markoheshkir was a +2 enchanted quarterstaff that amplified the wielder's spells .</p>
<p>The quarterstaff could be attuned to a specific element, granting access to additional spells and effects aligned with that element. This attunement was achieved through the casting of Kereska's Favor , a spell uniquely available to those wielding Markoheshkir . Even those without prior magical know-how could invoke this spell.</p>
<p>The staff allowed the wielder to cast a spell without expending any resources, though this could only be done occasionally.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point prior to the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Kereska imbued the quarterstaff Markoheshkir with her power, granting a humanoid wielder elemental energy sourced from the goddess.</p>
<p>At another point prior to 1492 DR, the weapon was acquired by the notorious human wizard Lorroakan , who kept it in his base of operations: Ramazith's Tower in Baldur's Gate .</p>
