<p>Kadarasto , also called the City Most Sinister , was found in the heart of the jungle within the Cities of the Ancients in east Zakhara .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Kadarasto sat atop a bluff above the Nogaro River , about 100 mi (160 km) up the flow from Dihliz .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The city's appearance was dominated by an unusual lightless and angular architecture. Kadarasto's long history was present in many ruins in the city and the surrounding countryside, which was believed to have once been the old kingdom of Kadar .</p>
<h2>Religion</h2>
<p>The Enlightenment came late to this part of Zakhara , and its natives had a reputation of secretiveness, savagery, and idolatry giving Kadarasto the title "City Most Sinister". This was evident in the slight stature of the various mosques to the Enlightened gods when compared to other cities in Zakhara.</p>
<p>The Cult of Ragarra maintained a stronghold within the catacombs beneath the city. In addition to that, many shrines and idols could be found above ground in select allies. This somewhat open worship of Ragarra , a savage goddess in a supposedly Enlightened city, was a stark contrast with how other settlements within the Cities of the Ancients viewed Ragarra's worship.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Most of the populace was believed to derive its income from rice and more notably the antiquities trade, such as tomb robbing.</p>
