<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Salmon Bay jutted south into the island of Alaron where the Sea of Moonshae and the Sea of Swords met. It cut southeast into the kingdom of Gnarhelm for approximately 30 miles (48 kilometers), nearly bisecting the kingdom into eastern and western halves. The southern end of Salmon Bay was connected to the Vasty Drink by a small unnamed river. The mountains of Hardangheight framed the bay's western shore.</p>
