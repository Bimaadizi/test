<p>Falataer was a powerful bard , musician, and instrument maker from the Moonshae Isles , famed for creating the original Instruments of the Bards of Toril .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Long before the 14 th century DR , Falataer was known as a wise teacher and a bard of impressive powers. He ran a bardic college on the Moonshae Isles and tested his students with the Instruments of the Bards , later gifting them to his best students. Over the centuries, Falataer's designs were copied, and the instrument retained the great bard's name as a sign of respect. Many of the copies Instruments of the Bards were less powerful than his originals, however.</p>
<p>By the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , it was believed that there were only about twenty Falataeric Cli lyres left in existence, at least those exquisite lyres that were hand-crafted by the great bard in his workshop back on the Moonshae Isles. One of these instruments was sold at the Chromatic Scale , a musical instrument shop in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate .</p>
