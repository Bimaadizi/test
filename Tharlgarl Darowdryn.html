<p>Tharlgarl "Steelfists" Darowdryn was a member of the noble House Darowdryn , one of the oldest and wealthiest merchant families of Arrabar and all of Chondath in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tharlgarl was a huge man who resembled a bear who prided himself for his great white mustaches that hung below his chin. His nickname â€“ "Steelfists," came from the man's habit of wearing a heavy set of gold -ornamented pompous plate mail , even in Arrabarran sweltering hot and humid climate.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Tharlgarl "Steelfists" Darowdryn could often be seen accompanying and guarding his aunt Ariskrit Darowdryn , the aging matriarch of House Darowdryn.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On Tarsakh 10 of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Ariskrit and Tharlgarl Steelfists attended Emriana Matrell 's grand celebration of becoming an adult, an Arrabarran tradition for a woman's 16 th birthday. During the celebration, Tharlgarl and Ariskrit witnessed an assassination attempt on Hetta Matrell 's life orchestrated by the cabal of Talriccis , Pharaboldis , and, as later revealed, Hetta's own family, as retaliation for the matriarch's disapproval of the sneak coin activities.</p>
