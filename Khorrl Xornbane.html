<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1372 DR , Clan Xornbane was hired by the Ched Nasadan drow House Zauvirr through a liaison named Zammzt (secretly an agent of the Jaezred Chaulssin ). The band was to fight and destroy House Melarn . However, Zammzt instructed them to attack too early. They successfully killed Matron Mother Drisinil Melarn but House Zauvirr's captives escaped and the duergar contributed to the chaos in Ched Nasad that led to its ultimate destruction. Matron Mother Ssipriina Zauvirr attacked Khorrl, killing him; the band fled the city.</p>
