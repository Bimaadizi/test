<p>The Lontles were a family living in Ravens Bluff in the Vast in the late 14 th century DR . They owned a shop selling rowboat fittings.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Their shop stood in the Burnt Gables neighborhood of the Crow's End district of Ravens Bluff, next door to the Downunda Patisserie . This was a middle-class business area, and nearer the upper-class area than the poor area.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>They sold oarlocks and other fittings for rowboats. By 1370 DR , however, Jemima Chisolm of the Downuda Patisserie had recently hired some of the Lontles to run errands buying and fetching ingredients such as flour , fruits , nuts , and sundry seasonings.</p>
