<p>Janas was one of the Blades of the Old Man as of 1374 DR . He possessed a short sword and a Topsider's Crutch , given unto him by Talieth as part of his induction in 1371 DR , which meant he got guard duty far too often. He was afraid of Sauk , remembering what he had done to Chiganis . According to Ferluk , he was a Nar . He joined Talieth's conspiracy to kill the Old Man of the Mountain a few months before his death. On the night of Tarsakh 25 , he was on guard duty at the Fortress of the Old Man ; after distracting him with his treeclaw lizard , Perch , the ranger Berun killed him while making his way in.</p>
