<p>House Hrost Ulu'ar was one of the ruling drow Houses of Menzoberranzan in the Northdark in the late 13 th and early 14 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>House Hrost Ulu'ar rose to its Ruling Council status sometime before the Year of the Singing Skull, 1297 DR , when it held the seat of the fifth House of Menzoberranzan. By the Year of the Adder, 1328 DR , Hrost Ulu'ar took the fourth House's place after the fall of House De Vir . However, 1328 DR also took House Hrost Ulu'ar's seat, leaving it likely completely destroyed at the hands of House Xorlarrin , which also claimed Hrost Ulu'ar's spot in the center of Qu'ellarz'orl .</p>
