<p>Sardok was a thief helping the wizard Trifakas in his quest for Martek 's sphere of power. Together with the wizard, they became stuck in the Garden of the Cursed until other adventurers arrived.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Sardok's constitution was outstanding; he also had excellent dexterity and optimal intelligence for a wizard, though he was a thief.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The thief was cruel, cunning, and usually rude.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Sardok truly believed Trifakas was going to get them out of the Tomb, and he was more loyal to him than Pawnis was.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The drow had arrived together with Trifakas and Sardok about one week before the adventurers who ultimately resurrected Martek did. He and Sardok were the last of Trifakas' band; the wizard decided to pose as an emissary of Grandal to the Guilders who lived there. Sardok and Trifakas decided to live in a hut away from the Guilders. The three discovered they were trapped soon after; when new adventurers came bearing every Star Gem of Martek , the thief helped investigate these new arrivals.</p>
<p>If Trifakas' band managed to acquire the Star Gems, they may have proceeded with the trials of Martek. In such a case, they may have been found dead by the entrance of Martek's treasury.</p>
