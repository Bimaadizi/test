<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Sarafin was a member of an adventuring band that included the gnome Yonks , the half-orc Zog , and the tiefling Quinara . The group traveled the Sword Coast in search of steady adventuring work. They traveled from Waterdeep to Baldur's Gate during the Absolute crisis and, unable to find work, planned to move out to Neverwinter as the city was searching for adventures. During her stay in Baldur's Gate, Sarafin took a swim in the River Chionthar but emerged dirtier than before the plunge. The river was polluted at the time by Lord Gortash 's machinery.</p>
