<p>Floodblest was a small farming village located east of the city of Neverwinter along the southern bank of the Neverwinter River .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Those who traveled east from the city of Neverwinter, along the Neverwinter River, reached the small town of Floodblest. It stood relatively close to the edge of the Neverwinter Wood and neighbored the city of Nightsedge further east, on the opposite bank of the river.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Most trade in Floodblest came from its farming community. Apart from that, the town served as a layover and a rest stop for those who traveled from further east to the city of Neverwinter, or from Neverwinter to the neighboring town of Nightsedge.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid-14 th century DR , the village of Floodblest became afflicted by a mysterious disease . The Lord-Mayor of Floodblest thought that the hard times were orchestrated by a vile villainous spellcaster hiding somewhere in the village. The first omen was the town's well going dry shortly before the disease became apparent. Lord-Mayor's hired adventurers managed to discover that the city's well led to a mysterious dungeon in its depths; however, those who tried to venture in were never seen again. The Lord-Mayor sent an aid request to Nasher Alagondar of Neverwinter, hoping the western neighbor could send a band of able-bodied adventurers to find the cause of the ill-luck.</p>
