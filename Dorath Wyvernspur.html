<p>Dorath Wyvernspur was a dowager matriarch of the Wyvernspur family circa 1358 DR and one of the very few Wyvernspurs able to transform into an actual wyvern when using the family's heirloom, a mummified wyvern's spur .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Dorath Wyvernspur was a tall, robust older woman with thin lips and a hawk-like nose, similar to many other members of the Wyvernspur family. She wore her black-streaked-with-grey hair in a tight bun. She had a perfect stiff and proper posture and body language.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Even though she raised him, she constantly nagged her great-nephew Giogioni Wyvernspur for his clumsy and unlucky mishaps and his adventure-lust that he shared with his long-dead father. The nagging only got worse after he dishonored the family by ruining a wedding celebration while imitating King Azoun Obarskyr IV .</p>
<p>Giogi thought Dorath to be a horrible gossip and too friendly with King Azoun's court wizard, Vangerdahast .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>At one point, Dorath had a pet land urchin . Due to another one of Giogioni's misadventures, it was eaten by a giant snake .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1357 DR , Dorath was present at the wedding of Gaylyn and Frefford Wyvernspur at the Dimswart Manor outside of Suzail . During the celebration, a sellsword named Alias , being controlled by mysterious forces, attempted assassination of Giogioni. The young nobleman survived the attempt, but, as always, was nagged by Dorath and blamed for the scuffle.</p>
