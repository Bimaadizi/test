<p>Mhairdren Phull was the patriarch of House Phull of Waterdeep .</p>
<p>Around 1440 DR , Lord Phull purchased a title of nobility from the impoverished original Phulls. Shortly after the new Phulls moved into the family mansion, Mhairdren's second son Blakrho murdered his older brother and blamed the crime on a younger brother. The City Guard initially believed Blakrho but Mhairdren caught his son beating his mother and was thrown down a flight of stairs and gravely injured. Blakrho fled Waterdeep with most of Mhairdren's coin and his best wine .</p>
