<p>Tarikat Island was the largest single island of Al-Tarik Islands in the Golden Gulf and Crowded Sea within west Zakhara .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Tarikat Island was found near the center of the archipelago. It measured roughly 100 miles (160 kilometers) in length with a width of about 45 miles (72 kilometers). A large unnamed mountain range dominated the interior structure of the island. The range's southwest region was split by a wadi that reached both the northwest and southeast shores. Rocky outcroppings formed the shore of Tarikat Island, with coral reefs and sand banks surrounding the vast majority of the coast. Natural bays sat at the island's north and south ends.</p>
