<h2>History</h2>
<p>Valmir was originally a thief from Darromar . After a falling out with his guild, he moved around Tethyr , where he learned some of the Art . Somehow, he impressed Merzan while on the run from a noble, who offered him an audition with Alaodin , a few years before 1374Â DR . He had become Talieth 's lover since.</p>
<p>Kerlis , Valmir and Dren stayed behind to watch Berun and Lewan when Sauk decided to hunt down some yaqubi , expecting them to be carrying gold. Berun disabled them and fled, though Sauk's party caught up to them by the next morning.</p>
<p>When in Sentinelspire, he employed a fireball to release Talieth and Sauk from their vine bindings at the Tower of the Sun on the night of Tarsakh 25 . He survived the whole evening.</p>
