<p>Chonis' Temple was the name given to a ruined structure in western Cormyr. It lay east of Eagle Peak , in the foothills of the Stormhorns .</p>
<p>The ruins were thought to have once been a temple, and prominently bore the name "Chonis", written in the Thorass alphabet , a feature it shared with the Tomb of Chonis . Hence, it was called "Chonis' Temple". None knew who or what Chonis was, however; some speculated it was a long-forgotten deity, demigod, or fiend.</p>
