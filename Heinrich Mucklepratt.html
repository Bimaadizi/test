The book discussed the mysterious Moonwells found throughout the Moonshae Isles. When he removed the horn from the book a jolt of energy shot through his body. Ever since then he was obsessed with Moonwells and finding one. He learned about the existence of a single Moonwell on Snowdown and wished to visit the sacred place.
