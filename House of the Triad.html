<p>The House of the Triad was one of the celestial planes of the World Tree cosmology . A plane that exemplified the rule of law upholding the principles of good, it contained the realms of Ilmater , Torm , and Tyr , as well as Helm and Siamorphe .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The plane's main feature was the great mountain Celestia , which was surrounded by three smaller mountains, each of which hosting the realms of Ilmater, Torm, and Tyr. The realm of Siamorphe was located in a valley between Celestia and Tyr's realm, while Helm's realm had no fixed position in the plane.</p>
<p>In general, the House of the Triad was a resplendent plane that shone with heavenly radiance, marked by bright palaces with majestic marble halls.</p>
<h2>Cosmography</h2>
<p>The House of the Triad was connected to the lower branches of the World Tree , but there were no known portals that led to or from the plane. The central mountain, Celestia, was considered a divine realm in itself and was described to be identical to its Great-Wheel counterpart, although no deities resided there according to the World Tree cosmology.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The plane was inhabited by archons and archon paragons that lived in the plane and served Ilmater, Torm, or Tyr. Many archons lived on the surrounding mountains and served their deities directly, but the enormous central mountain, Celestia, was home to most of them. Archons that lived on Celestia were ruled by Zaphkiel , but also seemed to serve the various deities in the plane. The mountains were also inhabited by angels , who served the Triad , and took on the bulk of the missions to other planes. In addition, the plane was home to formians who occasionally served Helm and Siamorphe, but usually led their orderly lives undisturbed by divine interference.</p>
<p>The House of the Triad was also home to battle dragons and radiant dragons , who were not uncommonly seen throughout the plane.</p>
<h3>Petitioners</h3>
<p>Most of the plane's petitioners were lantern archons who were not committed to the plane and were free to leave it at will. Petitioners who tended more strongly towards neutrality , as well as followers of Helm or Siamorphe, retained the forms they had in life, but with the benefits of immunity to electrical attacks and petrification , as well as a greater resistance against physical attacks than they had in life.</p>
