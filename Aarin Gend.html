<p>Aarin Gend of Neverwinter was Lord Nasher 's personal spymaster in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was a strongly built human man with dark skin and hair, typical for Chultans .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>As spymaster, he was determined and ambitious to succeed despite the consequences whilst he kept a calm, and at times witty, exterior. He also struggled with his loyalties and worried deeply about repeating a situation where he would have to choose between his work for Lord Nasher and his heart, but ultimately he always chose the greater good for Neverwinter.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Aarin was an ally to Aribeth de Tylmarande and did his best to find her when she was missing before ultimately discovering her betrayal and fighting against her. He also worked closely under Lord Nasher. Later, he grew infatuated with Captain Kettia Freeborn during his time in Icewind Dale and the feeling was mutual.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As a rogue , Aarin had high persuasive abilities, skill with a blade, and great stealthiness. He also could forge documents.</p>
<p>During his time in Neverwinter, he showed skills in leadership and assisted in saving the city and its inhabitants.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He owned an amulet that he might have given away as a sign of his love for the recipient. He was armed with an enchanted +1 shortsword , a similarly magical dagger , and he wore an enchanted set of +1 studded leathers .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Aarin was born as a slave in Calimshan but escaped that life by killing his former master and avenging his mother's death, though he later admitted to being ashamed of the act. He went on to work for a pirate named Randall the Red on the Sword Coast , where he gained skills and information. Lord Nasher imprisoned Aarin after killing Randall but Aarin was soon given a chance to make up for his past mistakes.</p>
<p>Aarin later worked undercover in a thieves' guild in order to get close to and kill the leader, Calliara . However, he had fallen in love with her and gave her an ultimatum: to leave the thieves guild and criminal life, and potentially run away together, or die at his hand under the command of the justice system. Neither of them backed down so a fight ensued and Calliara was killed in the process. Aarin continued to work for Lord Nasher and Neverwinter and aided both greatly.</p>
<p>By the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Aerin had already served Neverwinter for twenty years. That year he played a role in protecting Neverwinter through the outbreak of the Wailing Death , the Cult of the Eye 's plots, and an attack from Luskan , aiding the adventurer who wold later become the Hero of Neverwinter .</p>
<p>Soon after the plague and the war ended, the Hero of Neverwinter had a falling out with Lord Nasher and left Neverwinter, soon disappearing and thought dead. Aarin Gend grew close with the Hero, and with them gone, missing, Aarin was tortured by black melancholia , made worse by his disagreement with the Lord of Neverwinter over the execution of Aribeth de Tylmarande. According to what Aarin shared with others, he demanded to be dismissed from service or be executed like Aribeth, and eventually, Lord Nasher dismissed the spymaster, saying his debt to Neverwinter was paid in full. However, that was not true. Aarin was tasked with finding the famed Hero of Neverwinter by Lord Nasher himself. After the Hero disappeared, Aarin tapped into his spy network to try and track them down. He followed rumors to Waterdeep to no avail. When rumors reached his ear that someone matching their description was seen in Icewind Dale, the spymaster headed north. In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Aarin came across the Hero after they were found washed ashore in Maer Dualdon with no memories of the past. They met in Targos , and the spymaster joined his friend in tracking down the lost memories and, along the way, stopping the doom that hanged over the Ten Towns .</p>
<p>Standing side by side with the Hero of Neverwinter and several other adventurers, Aarin stopped the strange blue-skinned shaman calling himself Iceblood and stopped demigod Arctus from decimating the region. Their adventure culminated in a battle of Targos, where Arctus the Walking Winter was defeated and returned to his glacial prison. During the adventure, Aarin grew infatuated with Captain Kettia Freeborn of the Grim Voyager whom they helped to get rid of a nasty night hag curse . Aarin and Kettia made an agreement to have the Hero sail into the Sea of Moving Ice to find the mysterious Masked Lady who was responsible for the Hero's amnesia . After that voyage was over, Captain Freeborn was to sail to Neverwinter to deliver both the spymaster and the Hero to Lord Nasher. However, that was not to be. Spymaster Aarin Gend found the Hero only to lose them again. The Hero of Neverwinter was sent into the Underdark by magical means, leaving their companions behind in the Sea of Moving Ice.</p>
