<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 1490s DR , the Absolution Council—Jarnathan, Kriv Norixius , Voss Anderton , and Jil Torbo —were to meet in Revel's End to consider a pardon for Edgin Darvis and Holga Kilgore for the crimes of skulduggery and grand larceny. However, a storm delayed Jarnathan's journey so the council started without him, but Edgin kept inquiring about Jarnathan's absence, when he'd arrive, and how unfortunate it was that he'd miss out on his story. He hoped that Jarnathan would free them. And he would, just not in the way that anyone expected. When Jarnathan entered, Edgin enacted his 'plan', with him and Holga fighting off the guards, grabbing the aarakocra, and jumping through the window, forcing him to fly them to ice below. Jarnathan was knocked out by the hard landing, but survived.</p>
<p>More than a year later, the same council met to consider Forge Fitzwilliam for pardon, but were wise to the same tricks and refused him. Forge also grabbed Jarnathan and tried to jump through the window, only to find it bricked up behind a curtain, stunning both himself and the poor aarakocra.</p>
