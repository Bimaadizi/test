<p>The Blackstaff was the name for a series of powerful magical staves, created and used by Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun and/or his successor.</p>

<p>It was believed that Khelben Arunsun, who carried the first Blackstaff title, selected a new Blackstaff every time he left Blackstaff Tower . However, it always appeared as a long wooden staff. It was longer than an average human was tall, roughly seven feet from base to tip. A ring of bulbs circled the staff at about eye level, and the staff was topped by a curved claw shape. The entire staff was pure black in color.</p>
<p>Samark Dhanzscul , the sixth Blackstaff, carried a staff known as the Duskstaff, which was a twisted metal staff with a crystal on top that flashed various colors. It was unknown whether this was an iteration of a Blackstaff or a different staff. The Duskstaff could only be moved by the current Blackstaff or by someone wielding Ncral's Ring .</p>
<p>Vajra Safahr , the seventh Blackstaff, carried a silver-shod Blackstaff. The Blackstaff she carried when proclaiming her status as the new Blackstaff was the "true blackstaff", a large rune-inscribed duskwood staff with silver veins. The whole staff was blackened by use. Atop the staff was a large axe head in the shape of snarling wolf head, which had glowing green eyes.</p>
