<p>Eugenius was a Netherese priest and arcanist who worked with Karsus in the later years of Netheril .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Eugenius intervened when Karsus attempted to build a new set of reflecting mirrors around the edge of the Eileanar enclave , with the goal of reflecting back any stray unused magical energies produced by the mythallars in the Mythallar Housing . While Karsus expected it to create a standing wave as the magical energy was reflected back and then exponentially increase the power of the mythallars , Eugenius pointed out the high likelihood of the experiment simply destroying the enclave in an enormous explosion. Miraculously, Karsus heeded this advice and abandoned the project, sparing the enclave another potential Karsus-induced disaster.</p>
