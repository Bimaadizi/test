<p>Uncle was what some called a particular reclusive wizard who owned a keep in the Kryptgarden Forest on the Sword Coast North . After his death, he left his keep to a relative who was either his niece or nephew.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The wizard known as Uncle was a recluse who did not maintain contact with people outside his keep, even family. Nevertheless, he was kind enough to treat his servants well, and made a point of celebrating their birthdays each year with parties. He was also conscious about security, as he filled his moat with invisible spears and had a secret escape route out of his keep.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The wizard's most significant possession was Uncle's Keep , a modestly sized but well-decorated building in the southern end of the Kryptgarden Forest. In his keep, he kept a number of guards and servants. He also had a stable full of livestock, which included a pony .</p>
<p>He owned a magical mirror that could cause someone to be enthralled by their own reflection. He owned many other magic items , including enchanted weapons .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Before his death, the wizard lived a somewhat solitary life in his keep although he made regular visits to Red Larch .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The wizard had few relatives. He was married to a woman from Red Larch, and had a friend who was a wandering druid .</p>
<p>He occasionally thought about his distant niece or nephew, to whom he was considered 'long-lost,' and who inherited his estate after his death.
His keep made him a target of the Lostafinga tribe of hobgoblins .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>About five years before his death, the wizard saved the life of a lord of Waterdeep , who repaid him by granting him a tract of land in the south end of the Kryptgarden Forest, as well as a keep there and money.</p>
<p>Some time after, the wizard became married to a woman from Red Larch. His wife and their unborn child both died during childbirth.</p>
<p>Two years after the death of his wife, the wizard's keep was raided by a patrol of the Lostafinga tribe of hobgoblins. They killed his hirelings, and the wizard as well. As he bled out from a fatal arrow wound, his last act was to write a will in ink and his own blood, leaving the keep to a particular niece or nephew of his.</p>
