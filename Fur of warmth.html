<p>A fur of warmth was a magic item rumored to be taken from creatures native to the Paraelemental Plane of Ice .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This item was a white fur measuring 5 feet (1.5 meters) by 8 feet (2.4 meters).</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Anyone wearing a fur of warmth still felt the cold of their surroundings but did not suffer any harmful effects that it could cause. The fur also negated some of the physical harm caused by any cold-based attacks from magic or by creatures.</p>
<p>To benefit from the fur's magic it simply needed to be draped around the wearer's shoulders like a cape. The fur's magic would be rendered useless if it was cut into more than one piece.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Specialty priests of Waukeen called goldeyes had a chance of receiving a fur of warmth as one of the magic items they were given upon their admission to the clergy.</p>
