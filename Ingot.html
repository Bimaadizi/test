<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before 1368 DR , Ingot, along with his gnoll tribe, occupied the old abandoned keep on the coast that came to be known as the Gnoll Stronghold . In 1368 DR, the gnolls of the stronghold captured Dynaheir , a Rashemaar wychlaran . Ingot expressed a desire to roast the witch and taste her flesh instead of keeping her in the stronghold's cellars. As a result, he was banished by his fellow gnolls. Embittered, Ingot wandered the area of the Dryad Falls to the stronghold's east and encouraged adventurers to conquer the Gnoll Stronghold.</p>
