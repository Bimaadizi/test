<p>Anaglathos was a blue dragon and a one-time ruler of Turmish in the 1240s DR before being slain by the paladin Corwin Freas .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>By the time Anaglathos claimed the rulership over Turmish, he already was a powerful ancient dragon .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Anaglathos was a cunning and power-hungry blue wyrm who used his magical abilities and raw power to rise to power. As a Lord of Turmish, he was a ruthless leader who charmed, intimidated, and destroyed all who stood against him. Like many other dragons, Anaglathos was an avaricious individual who claimed and hoarded the wealth of his kingdom.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The dragon Baurthaglos , also known as Anglaspark, was a child of Anaglathos. He laired in the Orsraun Mountains but didn't seem to have the same aspirations of rulership as his father.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lord Sjorn Sendreth of Turmish drained his nation's treasury in a fruitless War of 1220 against the dwarves of Ironfang and to replenish it, a call for adventurers and treasure hunters was put out. Turmish-sponsored treasure hunting parties were sent into the Orsraun Mountains , where Anaglathos, an ancient blue dragon, hid his hoard. In the Year of the Yellow Rose, 1242 DR , the adventuring Company of the Sabred Tooth was guided through the mountainous perils by a local ranger Forier and his trusted animal companion , a wolf named Emerald . The band uncovered Anaglathos's lair and swiftly started collecting the treasures. Anaglathos remained out of sight, and despite his first instinct to unleash his deadly lightning breath on the intruders, he decided to use trickery. The wyrm slew Emerald and took its shape, accompanying happy adventurers back to Alaghôn and magically charming the Company of the Sabred Tooth. As they passed through Turmishan settlements, the dragon used magic to enthrall leaders and his draconic might to scare folk into submission.</p>
<p>The treasure-hunting troupe was granted an immediate audience with Lord Sendreth due to the immense wealth procured. Without wasting time, Anaglathos revealed his true form and swiftly disposed of the Lord of Turmish, claiming the title. This was how the Reign of the Wyrm began. Anaglathos's rule was characterized by swift deaths of any who opposed the new lord and collection of most of the nation's treasures in the dragon's hoard in Alaghôn. Lacking interest in commerce, trade rapidly declined in Turmish, leaving very little mercantile activities in the nation. And Turmishans were nothing but meals and playthings for the cruel despot. During his rule, Anaglathos lent dungeons of the palace to a lich -queen of Unther . The undead guest ended up outliving the blue-scaled tyrant.</p>
<p>The Reign of the Wyrm was cut short in the Year of the Purple Basilisk, 1247 DR . A rebellion rose against the Anaglathos, and many members of the said rebellion were roasted on a stake. However, that act did not scare the rebels away and instead instigated the Night of Redemption . During that hot summer night that helmed the changing season, paladin Corwin Freas led a band of adventurers to face the blue dragon. Corwin and his bad emerged victorious, and Anaglathos met his demise. The grateful folk of Turmish crowned Lord Corwin Freas as the new ruler. His right was very short-lived, ending a year later, in Year of the Cockatrice, 1248 DR , with the abolition of monarchy and establishment of the Assembly of Stars .</p>
