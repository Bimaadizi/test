<p>The Bounty of the Goddess was a temple of Chauntea located in the town of Archenbridge , in the Dalelands during the mid–14 th century DR . It was run by High Harvestmaster Thaliach Mindogar , and staffed by several lesser clerics .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple was located in the center of the city, on the River Way—the most exclusive neighborhood of Archenbridge.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The temple had a magnificent façade, with a large arched doorway flanked by two towering pillars that resembled stalks of wheat. This facade led into a large barn filled with plants and crops all sown into the temple's floor of tilled earth.</p>
<h3>Statue of Chauntea</h3>
<p>In the front garden of the temple was a large, stone fountain in the shape of Chauntea. In this depiction, sculpted by the famous dwarven stonemason Feldyn Fullbellow , the All-mother took the form of a barely clothed woman emerging from a blossoming flower extending one hand into the air. From her hand emerged an arc of water, which was blessed by her priests three times per day.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>In addition to typical temple services, the Bounty of the Goddess sold vials of the blessed fountain water. A single vial cost 25 gp , or 20 gp for visiting clergy or dedicated followers of Chauntea .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the 14 th century DR the worship of Chauntea was a large part of life for many of the Archenfolk , even in the face of expanding commerce and mercantile enterprises. This was due in large part to the leadership of High Harvestmaster Mindogar: under his guidance, the church's identity transformed from placid and reliable to a local power with political and economic influence.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Chauntea had become the most-worshiped deity within Archenbridge.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Local tales told that if a priest of Chauntea was slain in the Arkhen Vale , the fountain water would turn to blood. It was said this blood could cure disease, infections from fungi or molds , mummy rot , lycanthropy , and withering , and that it could even make barren lands fertile. The clergy understandably discouraged people from spreading such rumors.</p>
