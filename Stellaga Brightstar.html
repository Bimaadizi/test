<p>Mornmaster Stellaga Brightstar was the Lathanderian high priestess of the Glory of the Morning temple in Archenbridge .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was a rather tall and lean woman.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Mornmaster Stellaga was a soft-spoken and diplomatic leader, who could be quite an upstart when she so chose.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The efforts of Stellaga and her priests brought much wealth and prosperity to Archenbridge and greatly improved the lives of its residents.</p>
<p>While she was dedicated to her work, Stellaga took little time to indulge in her more secret indulgences, including dancing, adventuring and enjoying romances with travelers from far-off lands.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Stellaga was aided in her duties by Hand of Lathander, High Morninglord Orblin Storntar and 15 other clergy members of the temple.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On one occasion, the barbarian Belorn "Battleaxe" attempted to escort Stellaga and commander Jalia Mossgreen to a revel hosted by the Arkhen Clan . Despite being influential leaders both, Stellaga and Jalia managed to get into a fairly serious fight that evening. It was Belorn that came out worse for wear however, when he attempted to "protect" them from one another.</p>
