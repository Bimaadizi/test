One fateful night, they came across a site of a goblin ambush in a forest outside Silverymoon . Three fellow adventurers— S'feria Ranul , Oagla'ta , and Nyzeil Nighthammer —were fighting for their lives, and the trio of women rushed to help. The group dispatched the bandits with natural ease, battling in synch. S'feria became enamored with the new allies' battle prowess and convinced them to join her adventuring band, the Sisters of the Blood Moon .</p>
