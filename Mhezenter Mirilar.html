<p>Mhezenter Mirilar was a human thief in the city of Wheloon in Cormyr in the midâ€“14 th century DR . He worked at Rallogar Hardware but was also a thief.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mhezenter was a thin man with a beak-like nose. He feigned being deaf .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>During the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR , Mhezenter worked for Zendaros Rallogar at Rallogar Hardware, loading crates of goods. He slept in the store's attic at nights. However, he was also a thief, and usually spent his nights robbing local warehouses and caravans passing through.</p>
<p>He was available to train other thieves, if they could catch him and survive a duel with him, for a sufficient payment. Mhezenter shrugged off attempts to blackmail him, then attacked and fled those who might threaten him.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Mhezenter wielded a slim, rapier -like short sword and darts , both of which he took to poisoning if he felt threatened. The poison induced sleep, but was old and had lost a little of its effectiveness. He also possessed a necklace of fireballs (with a single use left in 1358 DR), and a ring of the ram , which he hid elsewhere in Wheloon, though he retrieved it if in danger.</p>
