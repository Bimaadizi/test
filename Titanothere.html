<p>The titanothere ( pronounced : / t aɪ ˈ t æ n oʊ θ ɪər / ty-T@N-o-theer ), also known as brontotherium , was a massive ancient horned mammal related to rhinoceri .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Titanotheres had an appearance similar to that of a rhinoceros. The key difference was that titanotheres were much larger and had a large, blunt horn on their snout. Some had two or even more horns and they came in various shapes and sizes. Others lacked a horn completely. Some had stony hides, very thick and strong enough to provide protection. Others were covered in horny plates or thick, shaggy fur.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>These massive creatures had irritable dispositions.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Titanotheres were dangerous prey. When threatened, a titanothere would not hesitate to charge at a predator. It was strong enough to throw a humanoid up to 20 ft (6.1 m) with a blow from its horn. Titanotheres also trampled smaller targets, crushing them.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Titanotheres were herbivores and lived in small herds.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Titanotheres were known to live in the Chultan Peninsula .</p>
<h3>Usages</h3>
<p>The hide of a titanothere was often used as leather armor . An intact titanothere hide sold for up to 70 gp and provided enough material to craft armor for large humanoids.</p>
<p>The Pterafolk of the Chultan Peninsula considered their flesh to be a delicacy.</p>
<p>A titanothere could be summoned by the conjure animals spell .</p>
