<h2>Activities</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Belkram was the high cleric of Dumathoin in Clan Melairkyn. Somehow, he acquired the Crown Adamant, which Belkram granted to King Melair I for his coronation. Afterward, Belkram was tasked by Dumathoin to always keep an eye upon the crown.</p>
<p>However, in time he tried to find a way to end his task, growing so desperate that he betrayed the location of the Crown to the drow of House Tanor'Thal . The drow raided Melairbode and Dumathoin cursed him to become an undead and guard the Crown for all eternity. For a time, he lived as a hermit in the Underdark . Later, trying to die, he jumped inside a lava tube but in time his body regenerated itself.</p>
