<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before it was turned into a mind flayer via ceremorphosis , N'ghathrod was a spacefaring elf . Although it had no memories of its past, it retained some of the elven sense of beauty. Before becoming a pirate, N'ghathrod lived in an illithid colony on the planet Glyth .</p>
<p>Sometime in the late 15 th century DR , while orbiting Toril , N'ghathrod's ship was captured by Halaster Blackcloak and transported to the Caverns of Ooze in the depths of Undermountain . Halaster stole the ship's spelljamming helm and left the marooned crew and the derelict ship to rot away. After some time, the illithid had to resort to eating the brains of its crew in order to survive. After it killed four of the orogs in the crew, the remaining orogs escaped. N'ghathrod then proceeded to wait in its lair for the appearance of other food sources.</p>
