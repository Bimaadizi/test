<p>Pelek was a deep gnome of Blingdenstone and a ghost in Gracklstugh in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Pelek lived in Blingdenstone until he met Buppido . He fell in with him and followed him to Gracklstugh. There, however, he discovered that Buppido was a mad killer, and Buppido killed Pelek. Some time after, probably because of the energies unleashed by the demon lords circa 1486 DR , he rose again as a ghost in Buppido's lair. He could only be given peace if someone took his remains back to his hometown and buried them there.</p>
