<p>According to Masked Lord Nymara Scheiron , Justin Tym was considered "no friend" of the Lords of Waterdeep , which was possibly precipitated by his publishing of an unauthorized and highly inaccurate biography of Khelben Arunsun , penned by Kaeti Blye .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At the time of making his career-defining publishing deal with Volo, Justin thought that he was taking advantage of the gazetteer, whereas his business partner thought the reverse was true.</p>
<p>When Volo's Guide to Waterdeep was published by TWL, the review of the Hanging Lantern festhall exposed the activities of the Unseen therein, rendering Volo a major target for that organization. Sometime in the latter months of the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR , Unseen leader Hlaavin exacted his revenge by disguising himself as Justin, intercepting one of his customary lunch meetings with Volo by rescheduling it from around highsun to the early morning, long before the company owner would be at his office. Hlaavin tricked Volo into handing over the only manuscript for Volo's Guide to All Things Magical, the Revised, Authorized, Expanded Edition , promising to pay a generous advance later that afternoon, and after their meeting was over, he burned it in the office hearth before Justin could return, at which point the mirrorkin took on the form of an unsuspicious window cleaner. When interrogated, Hlaavin told the publisher that Volo had left him a message, saying that he was unable to attend their meeting due to pressing business matters. Justin took this to mean that Volo was afraid to see him due to not having finished his manuscript for his Guide to the Moonsea , and was convinced by the cleaner to head home, none the wiser to Hlaavin's deception.</p>
<p>When Justin's secretary came to work a while later, Hlaavin retook the company owner's guise and told her to inform Volo that he'd no longer be welcome at TWL, feigning anger at the traveling author standing him up for lunch. He then took off himself, satisfied with his revenge. Later that afternoon, Volo returned to the offices for his advance payment as arranged by the disguised Hlaavin, only to be forcefully escorted off the premises by the similarly deceived secretary. Justin himself only heard of this incident the day after, and being unable to intuit what had happened, he fired yet another in his long line of secretaries.</p>
