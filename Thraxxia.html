<p>Thraxxia was a half-fiendish daughter of the demon lord Graz'zt .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Though she had no known succubus blood, Thraxxia physically resembled an alu-fiend , with an attractive, feminine human form, upsloping eyebrows and small, batlike wings. She was, however, far more powerful, having gained the might and magical powers of a nalfeshnee through trickery and guile.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thraxxia was the daughter of Graz'zt and a long-dead human monk . After killing three of her half-sisters to prove herself to her father, she then served as Graz'zt's personal assassin.</p>
<p>During the imprisonment of Waukeen , Graz'zt plotted to magically disguise Thraxxia as the goddess of wealth, counting on Lliira to transfer Waukeen's portfolio to Thraxxia in Waukeen's stead. This plot was thwarted by a band of adventurers in 1370 DR .</p>
