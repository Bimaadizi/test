<p>Gaheid Slickjaw was a dragonborn commoner, displaced by The Absolute , and as a refugee, sought shelter in Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gaheid was a large green-scaled dragonborn with axe -shaped horns and flaming red eyes. He wore a plain frilly-necked tunic and simple tan-colored breeches .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , an army assembled by the Cult of the Absolute moved from the Moonrise Towers in Chionthar Valley to menace the city of Baldur's Gate , displacing countless refugees in the process along the way. Gaheid Slickjaw and his beloved Hunkers Boolean found their way to the Rivington district outside the city walls, but, like all other refugees, they were refused entrance. The two men had to live in the tent city, only able to gain entrance with proper paperwork. Gaheid thought, somewhat sheepishly, that picking fights with the Flaming Fist mercenaries was a bad idea, to what his partner called him the "most cowardly dragonborn in the Realms ." Despite calling Gaheid a blockhead, Hunkers claimed to feel love for the man.</p>
