<p>Mituki was the ancient Reghedmen Hero of the Fox and Sky of Icewind Dale .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>A great forked tree on the western bank of Maer Dualdon was considered to be a monument of the ancient hero's glory by the local Reghedmen barbarians. The tree was almost 60 feet (18 meters) high around 1269 DR when the Great Thaw happened, melting the tundra's permafrost. During that time, the Accursed Tower that towered over the tree disappeared into the ground, and the Great Tree of Mituki bent backward away from the lake. The barbarians thought it was the hand of Mituki himself that buried the evil tower.</p>
