<p>A cloaking helm was a type of spelljamming helm that allowed the navigating mage to create an illusion of empty space around the ship to effectively cloak it from detection.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>While the cloaking helms created the appearance of invisibility from afar, the pilot and crew were still able to see the ship while it was in use. The only way to detect a cloaked spelljamming ship was through the use of ESP , detection, or scrying spells , or the refraction of bright light upon the ship's surface, which was visible within a range of about 1000 yards (0.9 km). This appeared as a blurred, rainbow-like effect around the ship's silhouette.</p>
<p>The cloaking field could be maintained for 3 hours every day, only when the ship was traveling at slower speeds. Any contact with another vessel, or firing of its weaponry would undo the illusion.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These helms were designed and crafted by a group of Arcane and wizards working together, for the Seekers in their information-gathering endeavors. Soon after word spread of their development, many of these researchers were assassinated and the helms sought with fervor. Few remained spread across wildspace , and as of the late 14 th century DR the few known cloaking helms not in use were in the possession of the Arcane.</p>
