<p>A dead box was a container that prevented the properties of the contents from being detected by any normal or magical means.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These boxes could be of any size (ranging from tiny coffers to entire rooms), but the sides of the dead box had to be made of solid slabs of atharstone . This made them both very durable and very, very heavy for their size. The sides were further sealed with a mixture of natural rubber and gorgon blood.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A dead box negated any and all efforts to detect the presence of magic, aura, alignment , temperature, etc. coming from inside the box. For this power to function properly, the box had to be airtight shut.</p>
<p>As in mortar , the use of gorgon blood in the construction process likely helped block scrying and certain eavesdropping spells . It might also mean that the walls could be warded against astral and ethereal travel.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was said that the name "dead box" originated both as a reference to the item's magic-deadening properties as well as a promise of what might happen to anyone foolish enough to hide inside of one to escape detection.</p>
