<p>The Were-Tongues or Were-Tongues of Lycanthropy was a general term to refer collectively to the racial languages of lycanthropes . Every type of lycanthrope had its own distinct racial language. These languages were not mutually intelligible, thus weretigers could not speak the language of werebears and vice-versa.</p>
