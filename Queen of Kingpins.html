<p>Queen of Kingpins was a record book compiled by the Flaming Fist mercenaries of Baldur's Gate on The Guild and Nine-Fingers Keene sometime in or before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>The book held information on the Guild, including the name and description of one of its thugs, Tusgront , who guarded the entrance to Nine-Fingers' base or at least one of the Guild's hideouts in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate. The book also had detailed information on the Guild's individual thugs, whom the Flaming Fist considered to be quite dim-witted. The book's tone changed when it talked about Astele Keene herself. It noted her sharp intelligence and used sullen, fearful tones.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A copy of Queen of Kingpins was stored in the basement and the printing room of the Baldur's Mouth offices in the Lower City in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR .</p>
