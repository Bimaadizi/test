<p>Kender Stumblenoodles was a simple one-dish eveningfeast meal created by the kenders from the faraway wold of Krynn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Traditional Kender Stumblenoodles were prepared by following several simple steps. First, the cook browned minced cow 's meat with diced onions and peppers . Then, tomato sauce, chopped tomatoes, and water were added to the browning pan to simmer. Noodles were cooked separately and later mixed into the meat and vegetable sauce.</p>
<p>Another version of cheese -drenched Stumblenoodles was also known to have existed. A pot -full concoction of flour , paprika , garlic powder , and red pepper were mixed with butter and, later, whisked with milk . Once thickened, the cook was to add mustard and cheeses. Then the cheese sauce was mixed with cooked noodles and baked in a greased baking dish, and topped with bread crumbs.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Historically, Kender Stumblenoodles was a more complex dish. According to the legend of its creation, kenders once needed to come up with a hearty meal for a horde of people, and they combined two popular kender dishes: Saucy Beef and Vegetable Stuff and Noodles that Look Just Like Aunt Helmley's Elbow, but Without The Warts. With time, kenders perfected the dish and claimed that Stumblenoodles always tasted better when mixed last-minute whilst entertaining a hoard of guests, to reenact the original legendary event that birthed the dish.</p>
<p>Another legend, born much later, talked about a different version of the dish and claimed that it was born on the waves of the Blood Sea of Istar, from a culinary battle of two kenders, when their pots mixed together in a hectic kerfuffle. Yet another legend came from kender adventurers who claimed that the other cheesy version of the dish was born from a draconian pursuit, in which a kender used the dish's ingredients and thrown weapons.</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , a cook named Kaga from the city of Daggerford came to prominence thanks to the cheesy version of Kender Stumblenoodles, which he so humbly renamed to Kaga's Stumblenoodles . The dish was especially popular among the children of Daggerford who did farm work for Kaga, for which he paid with Stumblenoodles imbued with minor magic.</p>
