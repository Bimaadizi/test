<p>The Reading Room was a fortified temple of Deneir in the Earthfast Mountains between Impiltur and the Vast in north Faerûn . It was located far to the south of the main temple of the Master's Library on Iron Dragon Mountain .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Although every devout follower of Deneir made at least one pilgrimage to the Master's Library, most only got as far as the Reading Room, which supported the Library.</p>
<p>A secret nonliving matter–only gate spell allowed notes and texts to be passed between the two, so that copies of texts could be lent to visitors.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Reading Room was governed by a Keeper ; a kind old woman in the late 1360s DR. She sent messages through the gate , and was aided and protected by loyal watchghosts .</p>
