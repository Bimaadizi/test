<p>Newt was a faerie dragon who lived in Myrloch Vale in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Newt's hide was orange and his body measured 2 feet (0.61 meters) in length, longer than the average faerie dragon.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Newt made the acquaintance of Tristan Kendrick when the prince and his companions were on a mission to rescue Keren Donnell . When they were escaping from the firbolg fortress, he helped them by creating illusions that distracted the giants. A few days later, Newt found Kamerynn after the unicorn 's attempt to cleanse a corrupted Moonwell of the Earthmother . It was crippled and blinded but the faerie dragon found out that it could see illusions and thought about a way to help Kamerynn by recreating the surroundings as an illusion so the unicorn could run towards Genna Moonsinger , the Great Druid of Gwynneth . The two creatures helped her rescue her daughter, Robyn Moonsinger , from Laric the Bloodrider who had kidnapped her. Finally, Robyn rode the unicorn while Newt helped it with its illusions so she could help Tristan in the fight against Kazgoroth .</p>
