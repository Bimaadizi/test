<h2>History</h2>
<p>While being mind-ridden by the evil vampire archmage Manshoon in late Mirtul of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR during the lead-up to the Council of the Dragon , Burrath guarded Lord Oldbridle during a dinner with a would-be noble and merchant, Andranth Glarvreth. Through him, Manshoon lied that there had been men following Lord Oldbridle in the street, which made Glarvreth's guards leave to hunt them down.</p>
<p>Unfortunatelym, several men burst through the windows moments later, and the unguarded Lord Oldbridle was slain, while Andranth Glarvreth escaped down a secret passage. Burrath was able to slay his Lord's murderer before following Glarvreth down the passageway; there, Glarvreth told him that the man with a grudge against he himself was Kormoroth, whom Burrath had just slain. He then dropped a portcullis, barring Burrath from accompanying him; the bodyguard took a different path out the house.</p>
<p>He then went to Immaero Sraunter 's property, where he was drugged and slept on the man's bed, all on Manshoon's instructions.</p>
