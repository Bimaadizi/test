<p>Hothal was a Baron of Galadorna during the mid–8 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was mostly seen in full, large, helmless armor.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>His men wore full armor, like him, or green-and-silver. He served King Baerimgrim , and fellow baron Feldrin was an ally.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the moot called by King Baerimgrim in the Year of Mistmaidens, 764 DR , Baron Hothal made a bid to become king, supported by Feldrin, promising he could make peace with Laothkund by giving them the mines of iron and silver in the forest. Despite his backroom dealings being unappreciated by his fellow barons, there was serious consideration for his offer. However, Baron Tholone 's bid later counted more supporters than his own, making Feldrin desert him and try to make a deal with the others, that he'd support Tholone's too if Hothal was slain on the spot. However, as the King tried to crown Tholone, they were both slain by a spell from Nadrathen . In the ensuing chaos, Hothal made an attempt to slay Nadrathen, getting himself killed by crossbowmen which were almost certainly mind-controlled by the mage.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>He was said to only take off his armor in order to don bigger pieces of armor.</p>
