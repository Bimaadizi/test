<p>The precious stone spinel was not native to North Faerûn . Spinels came to the region from traders with the Southwest and from visitors to Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Red spinels were said to come from southern desert country, while blue spinels came from the east, and the rare green spinels came from the jungles of Chult and Mhair .
