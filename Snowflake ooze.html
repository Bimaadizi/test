<p>Snowflake oozes were a type of ooze found in snowy and icy lands.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Unlike other oozes, snowflake oozes possessed an intricate crystalline structure, appearing lacy and fragile and like a huge snowflake, so they could be quite attractive, at least by ooze standards. They could reach diameters of around 10 feet (3 meters) with a thickness of roughly 4 inches (10 centimeters), yet they could compress their bodies to pass through gaps of only 1 inch (2.5 centimeters). They weighed 250 pounds (110 kilograms). At a glance, they could be mistaken for a bank of ordinary snow.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>They crept slowly around their area, hunting after warm-blooded creatures and trying to freeze them.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>They emanated an intense cold, enough to cause freezing injuries to any creature within 5 feet (1.5 meters). Naturally, snowflake oozes were immune to cold and cold-based attacks, and vulnerable to fire.</p>
<p>Despite its size, a snowflake ooze's volume was actually mostly air, making it difficult to attack effectively. Any piercing strike against it had a good chance of passing right through without doing it any injury.</p>
<p>Moreover, if struck with a blunt weapon, then, rather than be damaged, a snowflake ooze would crack apart and split into two snowflake oozes half the original's size. This could happen up to two times, making four oozes, before the resulting oozes were too small to split further.</p>
<p>They were skilled at climbing and, in areas of snow and ice, their snow-white coloration gave them camouflage.</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>The unintelligent ooze had no clever tactics, simply attempting to use its pseudopods to wallop, grab, and crush prey. Like its aura, its touch dealt freezing injuries.</p>
<h2>Habitats</h2>
<p>Encountered alone, snowflake oozes lived in cold climates where snow and ice could be found, in mountainous areas and in deep caves and tunnels.</p>
<p>Snowflake oozes were found in far northern Faerûn , from Icewind Dale to Narfell , where they preyed on travelers. It was reported that they shared caverns with some white dragons .</p>
