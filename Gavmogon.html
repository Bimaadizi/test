<p>Gavmogon , also known as the angry eye god to some of his lesser minions, was a beholder who had been transformed into a mindwitness following his enslavement to a colony of mind flayers . He menaced the region around Phandalin in the late 15 th century DR , even coming to be seen as a threat among the fey and the other beholders in the area.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He had a large, glowing central eye around which danced his four smaller eyes.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Gavmogon was mentally unstable and driven by a need for revenge against his mind flayer captors, which turned into a wish to destroy all other creatures that would not bend to his will. He was drunk on his own power and prone to gloating.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Gavmogon controlled a massive artifact known as the hollow of dominion , an underground chamber that channeled psychic energy to allow the wielder to commune with the minds of everything within 30 miles (48 kilometers) as well as to project psychic thoughts and control over vast distances. He claimed the complex in which the hollow was located as his lair, and from it was able to detect the presence of any intruders and assault their minds with distressing visions of their worst memories. Naturally, Gavmogon was highly protective of his control over the hollow of dominion and especially of its control device, the dominion rod .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Gavmogon worked to exert his will over the Phandalin region, believing that he had to prove his superiority by annihilating the minds of everything around him. He agitated monsters, spread madness, and caused chaos. His presence could be detected by some creatures in the form of "eyes in the sky".</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gavmogon was enslaved by the elder brain of a mind flayer colony based out of a crashed nautiloid in the Sword Mountains , who transformed him into a mindwitness and gave him potent psychic powers. He managed to escape from the mind control in the late 15 th century DR upon discovering the hollow of dominion , which held far greater power than the elder brain. He soon began projecting his influence on the region, leading to strange magical occurrences and more aggressive monsters. The magical disturbances he caused had the effect of attracting a coven of hags to the area, intrigued by the mysterious powers that were disturbing the fey in the region.</p>
<p>Gavmogon personally extended his control over monsters of Crooked Forest . At one point while there, he came across and nearly wiped out a tribe of goblins . The survivors came to revere him as a god —their "angry eye god"—even as he abandoned them. The tribe took on the name of the Angry Eye , and performed sacrifices in the name of their god as they awaited his return. He furthermore agitated a group of gnolls in the forest, prompting them to capture travelers to sacrifice to Yeenoghu . During one of his trips to the Forest, we was briefly glimpsed by one of the gnolls' captives, Alana Hallwinter .</p>
<p>About a year after his initial escape from the mind flayers, Gavmogon finally sought his revenge against the mind flayers. He used the power of the hollow of dominion to manipulate the elder brain into performing a ritual that would supposedly repair their downed nautiloid. Instead, the ritual inflicted madness on the mind flayers as well as all other creatures within 20 miles (32 kilometers) of their colony. This had the result of driving out a group of yuan-ti lairing in the mountains, who began conducting human sacrifices at a quarry near the Old Owl Well .</p>
<p>Gavmogon next began to enact his plan to use the hollow of dominion to inflict madness upon the town of Phandalin and the monsters in the surrounding area. Within a few tendays , an explorer named Aladair identified Gavmogon's lair as the source of the madness, and went to investigate. Subsequently hearing of Aladair's disappearance into said lair, Lady Ilsa Wisemantle of Neverwinter convinced the Town Council of Phandalin to send adventurers to help. At the same time, Gavmogon's machinations caught the attention of other beholders in the region, who both feared his power and wanted it for themselves. One of these rival beholders, Varunto , sent their own agent, the elf Faltrand , into Gavmogon's lair to intercept Aladair and defeat Gavmogon.</p>
