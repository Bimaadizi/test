<p>Earthfast plate was a type of full plate armor forged by the shield dwarves of Earthfast in the Earthfast Mountains of north Faerûn . It was famous for its non-magical strength.</p>
<h2>Construction</h2>
<p>Earthfast plate armor was a full plate armor of great strength, equivalent to full plate +2 but without being magical. It was said to be as good as the work of the legendary lost Clan Ironstar . For this, it was extraordinarily expensive.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Most suits of Earthfast armor were, naturally, designed for dwarves. Although the Earthfast dwarves could once be commissioned to make their armor for outsiders, they stopped when their city fell under constant siege from orcs and goblins . They had barely enough time to make and maintain their own, let own forge new sets for others. Thus, the few suits sized for non-dwarves were usually well-guarded treasures of wealthy families, in Amn , Sembia , Waterdeep and other places.</p>
<p>After Princess Alusair Obarskyr of Cormyr fought alongside the Earthfast dwarves in the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , they made her a suit of Earthfast plate armor made of finest mithril steel. Ironlord Torg mac Cei nicknamed her "the Mithril Princess".</p>
<p>During the Horde Wars of the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , the 2000 Earthfast dwarven pikemen of the Army of the Alliance wore their full plate armor, untested against Tuigan arrows . During the First Battle of the Golden Way , the Earthfast armor proved effective, with Tuigan arrows simply bouncing off where they did not strike exposed joints or open visors.</p>
