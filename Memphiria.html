<p>Memphiria was the divine domain of the Pharaonic and Mulhorandi deity of death, Osiris .</p>
<h2>Cosmology</h2>
<p>In the Great Wheel cosmology , Memphiria was one of the three triangular divine realms that made up Heliopolis . Under the World Tree cosmology , it was likewise part of Heliopolis, which in that cosmology was a neutral plane that was shared by all members of the Mulhorandi pantheon.</p>
<h3>Planar Traits</h3>
<p>In the Great Wheel cosmology, undead were deprived of their special innate abilities while in Memphiria. For example, the mummies of this realm did not produce mummy rot .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>In both cosmologies Memphiria was a desert realm, though in the Great Wheel it had a cool and chilly temperature to it. It also included both a surface area and an underground area, the latter reffered to as the "Underworld".</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In the Great Wheel cosmology, this divine realm was also primarily inhabited by petitioners. They moved slowly about their business and weren't as lively as the petitioners elsewhere in Heliopolis, but were still largely content with their lot in life. Underground, the spirits of kings who ruled wisely in life ruled over the spirits that had served them in life.</p>
<p>Beyond petitioners, his realm in the Great Wheel was inhabited by mummies (though they were not evil ) and a variety of other undead creatures that were not of evil alignment . The mummies of this realm would rise up to seek vengeance upon those who despoiled their graves, while other undead came to the realm in order to complete some form of quest or out of a desire to reclaim some semblance of a normal, mortal life. The petitioners of this realm treated the undead no different from the living, through they would fearlessly attack any undead that was evil.</p>
<p>In the World Tree cosmology, his realm was said to be inhabited solely by petitioners of Mulhorandi origin, though these petitioners were all non-evil corporeal forms of undead.</p>
