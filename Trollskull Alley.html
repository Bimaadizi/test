<p>Trollskull Alley was an alley located in the North Ward of Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The alley was a narrow passage that wound through the interior of the city block surrounded in the North and South by Saerdoun Street and Delzorin Street and in the East and West by Whaelgond Way and Windborne Way , respectively. Two entrance points existed into the alley from Saerdoun Street and one from Delzorin Street. The alley itself ran parallel to Delzorin Street at its eastern end.</p>
<p>At the southeast end of the alley, closest to the intersection between Whaelgond Way and Delzorin Street, a removable metal grate opened into a surface shaft that led to the Waterdhavian sewer system.</p>
<p>The narrow alley was marked by its architecture of closely-constructed rowhouses. Several business buildings also backed onto it from the surrounding streets.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a fireball was detonated in the alley by a nimblewright in the service of Yalah Gralhund , as part of an assassination attempt on the gnome Dalakhar . The blast killed eleven people, including Dalakhar and two of his Zhentarim pursuers, a group of halfling street artists, and several other civilians.</p>
<p>The nimblewright's objective was to obtain from Dalakhar the Stone of Golorr , an item that contained information on the whereabouts of a large treasure that had been obtained illegally by Dagult Neverember during his time as Open Lord and lay hidden somewhere in Waterdeep. The blast injured Urstul Floxin , who was also in pursuit of Dalakhar, but he managed to survive and take the stone to Gralhund Villa .</p>
