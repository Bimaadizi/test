<p>The Anai River was a river in the Plain of Horses region of northwestern Kara-Tur . It was the longest river in the region.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>With headwaters in the Chigiogi Mountains and Chigidi Mountains , the Anai River meandered southward through the northern Chigidi Mountains. Next, it turned west and flowed through the northern taiga , where it divided into many branches and lakes that watered the woodlands and farms there. The two largest were Lake Gusang in the east and Lake Yetuq in the west, near the Torgny Branch.</p>
<p>Back in the mountains, however, another branch of the Anai flowed northward, entered the Ama Basin , and was one of the many tributaries of the great Ama River .</p>
<p>While the Anai River was easily navigable by boats in the warm season, it froze over in winter. This forced the use of carriages and sleighs pulled by horses along the ice itself, in order to transport goods and people.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Many of the lakes fed by the Anai produced salt , the color of which varied with the soil in the lakebed. Green salt was most commonly used, while white salt was favored by the wealthy and red salt was thought to be only good for animals. Lake Gusang produced white salt.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>In the taiga, the Anai flowed past the Guychiang city of Peqqir .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>It was thought by some that the Anai River's gajar-un ejin (a local god that watched over the river) controlled the freezing and melting of the winter ice according to his whim. If those traveling the river offended him, he would melt the ice in moments to drop them in the cold water. However, if they were friendly, he might cause the river to freeze over just as quickly to let them go over.</p>
