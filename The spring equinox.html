<p>The spring equinox was a powerful magical ring found in Myth Drannor during the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The ring embodied the equally balanced power of the sun and moon , and channeled the full power of the spring season and spring equinox . It helped the wearer avoid all sorts of danger, and let them strike more rapidly and relentlessly in combat, draining the energy from the foe and exhausting them. A powerful charge of electricity built up in the ring all the while, eventually unleashing a deadly blast of lightning at the unfortunate target.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The ring was found in the ruins of Tyrintar's Hall when the Elves of Cormanthor searched for the lost Eilistraee's Wanderer Uhlsdrin Nirveth .</p>
