<p>The Crimmor Guard was a trained organization of armored fighters responsible for defending the city of Crimmor and patrolling its surroundings.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Guard served many purposes related to defending the city, such as patrolling the streets or manning the surrounding walls and towers.</p>
<h3>Ranks</h3>
<p>The Guard had specific titles for the members of their forces. A patrol usually consisted of twelve members, whose commanding officer was called the helm . Helm commanders were called resker , a title also used by the jailers. Commanding above every other members were the four high swords , who reported directly under the Mayor.</p>
<p>One was able to recognize the rank of a guard by counting red teardrops of blood visible on their tabards, above the city symbol: one drop for a helm , two for a resker and three for a high sword .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>During the mid-to-late 14 th Century DR , members of the guard wore chainmail under red tabards emblazoned in gold with the city symbol. During a patrol, every member wore a helmet , gauntlets , and thigh-high boots fitted with pouches. They fought using longswords , daggers and slings , the latter also being used to keep doves from nesting on building facades.</p>
<p>Should they need to apprehend an offender, guards carried with them leather thongs, leg-hobbles (made of stiff leather), collars and leashes. Those equipment was kept inside their leg-pouches.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Guard worked closely with the Bargemen , who patrolled the Alandor River , the westbound River Road , and the docks.</p>
<p>They also worked with the Shadow Thieves guild, which regulated criminal activities in the city and enforced a strict no-theft policy.</p>

<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>According to Volothamp Geddarm , guards were nicknamed Lobsterlouts because of the high-backed armor they wore made of rigid maroon leather.</p>
