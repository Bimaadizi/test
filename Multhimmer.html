<p>Multhimmer was a merchant , importer and shopkeep who ran a general store in Ashabenford in 14 th century DR . He would buy just about any kind of item but charged fairly high prices, adding a 20% markup on goods from his shop. He did occasionally deal in stolen goods, but was very careful not to bring in stolen items from the local Mistran.</p>
