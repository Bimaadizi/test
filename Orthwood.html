<p>Orthwood was a noble house of Cormyr .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The House was stripped of its nobility in the Year of the Wall, 1227 DR , when Nelnar Orthwood discovered his son Nars was plotting against the Crown and the son killed the father. The family lands and wealth were taken by the Crown to compensate their creditors. Nelnar's wife and daughters were allowed to say in a house owned by the Crown on the east side of the Starwater River and were given an annual stipend to provide a modest life.</p>
<p>The House regained its place in the Cormyrean nobility in the 14 th century as evidenced by Asbras Orthwood , a Knight Royal.</p>
