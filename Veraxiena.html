<p>Veraxiena was a great green dragon that dwelt within the King's Forest of Cormyr in the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Veraxiena was supremely arrogant and confident, as many elder dragons were, and considered lesser mortals a source of food and treasure. She was open to making deals with them, though, so long as she didn't have to do anything and was generously rewarded for it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the late 15 th century DR, Veraxiena moved into her new home, a swampy patch of land in the depths of the King's Forest. In the shortly following Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar , Cormyrean adventurers came across Veraxiena and tried to get her to take a side against the drow invaders. She was well aware of the potential threat posed by the forces of Cormyr and Sschindylryn , but didn't care what they did with each other so long as they left her alone. After some fraught negotiations, she may have been convinced to avoid eating Cormyreans for the duration of the war in exchange for a large amount of treasure.</p>
