<p>Hemish was a farmer living in Fullpoint . He took care of the newborn Araluen from 1368 DR to 1373 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In autumn of 1368 DR , Hemish found a baby, Ash , close to Fullpoint . He could not find the foundling's parents, and so took her in, looking for advice from Mausa at some point. Within a month, he sought new clues close to where he had found her; all he found is that the spot where she was had turned to blight. On the way back to the village, Ash manifested the ability to heal and revitalize sick animals, using this ability on Mausa's horse; Hemish discovered she had a gift.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1373 DR , Fullpoint was attacked by blightspawned volodni who took his daughter; he took an injury to his head during the fight, which incapacitated him. A priest of Lurue come from afar, Marrec , healed him, and explained that he had come to find a child in his care. Though Hemish was cagey at first, he finally revealed that he was not surprised someone had come for her, given her gift for healing.</p>
<p>When the priest returned with his adopted daughter, he asked Hemish to let her travel with him. Though initially reluctant to give her up, he soon relented. Once Ash finally became the aspect Araluen, she still held Hemish in high regard, for his kindness.</p>
