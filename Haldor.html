<p>Haldor was a Captain and the leader of the Targos Guard who served Speaker Kemp of Targos in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Haldor was a tall human woman with a light skin tone and long black hair. She wore the uniform of the Targos Guard: a set of chainmail , and was armed with a longsword and a shield , decorated with the Guard's heraldry.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Captain Haldor was a direct and no-nonsense woman who valued order and civility but used harsh words. Despite that trait, she was polite and tolerant towards those who would appear alien to the old or small-minded. She was an optimist who believed in the strength of the Ten Towns.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Haldor reached the position of a Captain sometime before the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , when Targos was flooded by refugees from the smaller of the Ten Towns , as various strifes began ravaging the region. She regularly had to deal with heightened tensions between people of towns that historically were bitter competitors. Some of the frustrated refugees from Termalaine claimed that Targosians hired a shaman to burry the town under the snow and destroy its fishing vessels. That was the year when Captain Haldor met the famed Hero of Neverwinter and accompanied them to meet Speaker Kemp and acquire the Hero's help in dealing with the strife.</p>
