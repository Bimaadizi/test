<p>Sohars were a type of ship commonly used by Calishites to ship goods.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>On average, from bow to stern these ships measured 90 feet (27 meters) in length, had a beam (width) of 25 feet (7.6 meters), and required a depth of at least 4 ft (1.2 m) in order to float.</p>
<p>Sohars sported three masts and had a small forecastle. They could hold up to 100 tons (91,000 kg) of cargo and supplies, around as much as a cog , though sohars tended to be faster and more maneuverable than most cogs. Each sohar could man a crew of up twenty individuals, but the average number of crew one could find on a sohar would be around eight individuals. The bare minimum of individuals needed to sail a sohar were four.</p>
<h2>History</h2>

<p>By 1371 DR , sohars were becoming a more common sight in the Inner Sea.</p>
