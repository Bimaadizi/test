<p>Epic magic , also known as true dweomers or high-level magic , was magic of incredible power. It was usually associated with ancient magical kingdoms like Netheril , but became severely restricted with Mystra's Ban after Karsus's Folly in the Year of Sundered Webs, âˆ’339 DR . Nevertheless, items and places of epic magic could still be found by the 14 th century DR .</p>
<p>Mystra placed a number of limits and impediments upon the use of such magic. These restrictions are as follows:</p>
<p>These limitations maintained an illusion of non-function; after the events of Karsus's Folly, Mystra altered the enchantments used in high-level magic such that they could not "take hold of the Weave ", as well as made some of the symbols and glyphs mentally damaging to any creature trying to read, memorize, or experiment with them. This led to a widespread, though mistaken, notion that mortals could no longer cast epic magic at all, as was Mystra's intention. Despite the secrecy, Mystra commanded that some knowledge of these limitations be disseminated through visions to any mages who prayed to her, Azuth, Oghma , or Savras specifically and directly about such things.</p>
<p>Mystra's Magisters were exempt from these limitations, as their attempts would always succeed. However, Mystra and Azuth were free to immediately reverse the spell's effects, and the Magister would lose their office and seemingly die for their transgression. In truth, they would be thrust into Mystra's Choice .</p>
