<p>Delphe was a star elf abjurer and a Keeper of the Cerulean Sign .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Delphe was reassured by her little superstitions, often murmuring "All's well in the Well" when nothing had happened.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Delphe was in charge of the Inner Bastion of Stardeep . and of monitoring The Well in particular.</p>
<h2>Equipment</h2>
<p>Delphe once possessed a Cerulean Sign , an amulet with potent magical powers against elder aberrations though it was destroyed in 1375 DR by Telarian using the sword Angul-Nis .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She considered Cynosure too unimaginative, and Telarian too humorless, though the former could make her laugh sometimes. There was some friction between her and Telarian from when a few years before, she'd been chosen to wield the Sign instead of him.</p>
<p>Eventually, she came to school Raidon Kane on the use of his bonded Cerulean Sign.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Delphe specialized in abjuration . Amongst the spells she could call upon quickly were wall of force , lightning bolt , and a version of black blade of disaster which she knew as a spellscythe .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Delphe's time as a Keeper started about a decade before 1375 DR . In Midwinter of that year, she thwarted one new escape attempt by the Traitor . Though Cynosure was of some help eventually on that day, she began to suspect the construct was not functioning properly.</p>
<p>Delphe confronted Telarian some days later after finding a letter from Captain Brathtar , learning about the Epoch Chamber and the raid on a nearby wood elf encampment on the same day that the raid was taking place. During the attack on Kiril Duskmourn, Delphe sterilized a well-born avatar generated from a simultaneous escape attempt; for that reason, she did not learn that Kiril had been attacked by the Knights in time. Considering the simultaneity implied the attackers were in league with the Traitor, she ordered the Causeway sealed, and disconnected all instances of Cynosure from the command functions in Stardeep.</p>
<p>She agreed later to reinject Cynosure into the loop, instance by instance. However, Telarian left her to this task alone. Due to fatigue, she decided to bring Cynosure back to functions with a small number of nodes, so that it could help her root out the infected nodes. Cynosure was able to inform her that the one subverting him was Telarian, and reveal the true extent of his subversions. She immediately sought him out, finding that he had ridden out of Stardeep through the Underdungeon; When he returned with Kiril Duskmourn , she tried to talk to her, and convince her that Telarian was the actual traitor. Before she could, Raidon Kane triggered a teleportation into The Well manually.</p>
<p>Telarian's sword severed half her hand and sundered the Sign she carried. Her hand was quickly regenerated by Cynosure, and she was joined by Raiden in combatting another Well-born avatar. After the battle, Delphe asked Raidon Kane to use his bonded Cerulean Sign to reinforce the wards around the Well. He accepted.</p>
<p>Per the construct Cynosure , as of 1396 DR , she had re-entered Sildëyuir fifteen years prior (placing the date in 1381 DR ) and never returned to Stardeep.</p>
<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>Telarian accused her of being the one that had been subverted by the Traitor when he was talking to Kiril Duskmourn.</p>
