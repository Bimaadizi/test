<p>The Fools Finger , also seen as Fool's Finger , was an obelisk standing in the Greypeak Mountains in the Delimbiyr Vale .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It was situated somewhere on the northern side of the range, some three days by foot from Shining Falls . It was a marker of the unofficial boundary between the Delimbiyr Vale and the wild, monster-plagued Fallen Lands beyond.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Standing at a lean, it was a massive pillar of stone formed of an unidentified magical stone that radiated cold and had a rosy red glow. The surface was crumbling, possibly because of the souvenir hunters.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Around 1372 DR , Hendris Teinel of the Scarlet Shield inn in Loudwater promised free meals nightly to any adventurer who could bring him back a piece of the Fools Finger obelisk. Despite the quality of the Scarlet Shield's food, many adventurers took him up on this for the sake of a ready source of food, luring many into the dangerous mountain territory and almost as many made it back with one of the stones. These he carved into small shields and sold to merchants leaving for Waterdeep . Apparently they were quite popular there among adventurers and nobles, who used them to make their drinks cold and glow. However, Hendris required them to be at least as big as his own, sizeable, big toe.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It's unknown for certain what the Fools Finger was or where it came from, but it was commonly believed to be an artifact of the fallen empire of Netheril , perhaps a part of one of its flying cities .</p>
<p>In Eleasias of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , adventurers returning from Fools Finger with some stones for Hendris met others returning from a failed effort to find Iirikos Stoneshoulder 's lost dwarven complex, and still more patrolling the road between Loudwater and Shining Falls . Near Tanglefork Woods , they rescued Blaz Merrymar from being tortured by Skar 's bandits.</p>
