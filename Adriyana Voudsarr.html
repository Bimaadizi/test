<p>Adriyana Voudsarr was the Magister from 278 DR to 292 DR . Mystra transformed her into Adriyana's Garter at her request.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>At the time of the duel from which she would emerge as Magister, she was wearing ragged clothing; her speech appeared to be back-country.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Adriyana was little interested in acquiring more magic , or in dominating those around her. She had a great love of the land around her, and much empathy.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Adriyana lived in a pond-side hut.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Adriyana was capable of polymorphing herself into a leaf with eyes, using that spell to survey the forest while drifting along on the breeze.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Before becoming the Magister, Adriyana had the habit of turning herself into a leaf with eyes. During the first part of her tenure as the Magister, she thoroughly trained local elves and humans as mages, teaching them love of the land as well.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Adriyana Voudsarr became the Magister upon defeating her predecessor, Ergrith Klavulgrun "Kingslayer", in a mage-duel upon discovering him taunting and torturing one of his hunters. After becoming the Magister, she was not seen in wider Faerûn for some years; challengers did not come to her for some time, as many had to rebuild their strength in the wake of the Kingslayer.</p>
<p>When challengers started to come to Adriyana, she turned away many; most made the error of rousing her rage by destroying the forest around her. After more than a dozen contests, her last victory was against Blaermar of Athkatla , whose fire spells caused such devastation that she requested Mystra remove her from office, offering her own life in exchange. Mystra accepted, and turned her into Adriyana's Garter .</p>
