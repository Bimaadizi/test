<p>After completion of construction of Seldarine's Hand circa 900 DR , the inhabitants of the citadel lived in a close alliance with the dwarves of Dorn's Deep. The troops of the elven citadel were outfitted with the best armor and weapons created by the crafters of both races. By 1281 DR , the Seldarine's Hand had been ruined for centuries and came to be known as the Severed Hand. After the citadel's fall, several shields of the Hand remained in existence and could be found inside the ruins until the Severed Hand was transported to Limbo in 1306 DR .</p>
