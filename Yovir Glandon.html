<p>Yovir Glandon was the high priest of Kelemvor in Phlan during the late 15 th century DR . He was also a member of the Order of the Silent Shroud .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Yovir was a reserved man, speaking as little as possible. He had no interest in the city's politics but hoped for the best for his people.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Yovir served as a priest of Kelemvor and caretaker of Valhingen Graveyard for 40 years.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , with rumors of dracoliches and ghost ships wandering the Moonsea on the rise, a madman arrived in the city speaking about a ghost ship. This convinced Yovir to hire an adventuring party to investigate the matter.</p>
<p>Some time later, the growing increase of undead activities in Valhingen Graveyard inducted him to once again hire adventurers to aid the acolyte Cassyt in their investigation on the matter.</p>
<p>During the coup instigated by Dragon Cultists , Yovir was nowhere to be found. It was later discovered that he died during the coup.</p>
<p>Around the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR somehow, likely with the help of the Dark Powers of Ravenloft , he was raised as an undead vampire . He fought against the army that tried to reclaim the city but at was destroyed for good by some adventurers .</p>
