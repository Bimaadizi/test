<p>The clairsentience discipline of psionics revolved around the expansion of senses, identification of other beings, and psionic information gathering. Such powers could grant other senses like darkvision or true sight , the ability to sense poisons or danger, visual or auditory information taking place miles away, offer glimpses into the past or near future, or predictions of the far future. Some of the most representative powers of this discipline included clairvoyant sense , object reading , precognition , psionic true seeing , and ubiquitous vision . Its equivalent among the schools of magic was divination . Much like the divination school, clairsentience had a subdiscipline called Scrying .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Clairsentience powers often exuded from the manifester in a cone-shaped area of effect that moved with the caster and extended out towards whatever direction they were facing. Often committing one's time to further scrutinizing of an examined area could lead to deriving further information from a manifested power.</p>
<p>Creatures that were immune to divination magic were typically likewise immune to clairsentience powers.</p>
