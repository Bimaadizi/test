<p>Chandlerscross was a clean, fresh-looking town in Scardale located on the River Ashaba within the great canyon called the Scar . This town rose to prominence, and even served as its capital city, during the occupation of the dale by a coalition of foreign forces during the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>While in 1356 DR the town was barely noticeable, by the late 1360s it had become a bustling center of trade, having evaded the chaos and destruction that was rampant in Scardale Town . Following that settlement's devastation during the Shaking Plague in 1370 DR , Chandlerscross was designated as the capital of Scardale.</p>
<p>Throughout the 1400s DR , Sembian merchants consolidated the nation's power over Scardale through a series of underhanded deals and betrayals. These actions culminated with Sembia's mercenary army marching on Chandlerscross and slaughtering many dalesfolk in the Year of the Walking Trees, 1421 DR . After their bloody coup, the merchant nation re-established Scardale Town as the capital of the dale.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>During the town's tenure as the capital of Scardale, Chandlerscross served as home to both the Provisional Governor , the inaugural incumbent of which was Khelvos Dermmen , and the Scardale Council .</p>
<p>The city watch was composed entirely of Scardalefolk, a point of pride for the dale after years of foreign occupation.</p>
