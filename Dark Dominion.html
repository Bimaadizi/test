<p>The Dark Dominion referred to the tunnels within a 5 miles (8,000 meters) radius of Menzoberranzan .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Drow patrols were a constant presence in the region, searching for banned creatures, monsters and surface elves and challenging them once spotted. A few guard outposts could also be found in these tunnels. At least ten of the tunnels that started here lead to the surface, including one that lead straight past Blingdenstone and into Mithral Hall and another that lead to the High Forest .</p>
