<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This darksteel tower shield was enchanted with a potent +2 defensive magic. When used to defend against individuals and creatures that followed and embodied good, these shields became as powerful as a +4 defensive enchantment.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Shields of Darksteel Tower originated in the infamous Darksteel Tower that stood looming over the surface of Faerûn some years before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . This tower was briefly lorded over by a vicious coven of surface drow elves. The tower was tirelessly guarded by black cotton -shrouded high priestesses at all hours of the day. The location of the evil drow was eventually discovered by the Harpers and, after a long struggle, the Darksteel Tower was destroyed. The Shields of Darksteel Tower were all that was left from the fallen tower, undamaged by Harper weapons and spells.</p>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR, several of the shields of Darksteel Tower could be found on the Sword Coast North in Neverwinter , the Jewel of the North, and as far as the eastern nation of Rashemen and its city of Mulsantir .</p>
