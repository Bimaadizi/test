<p>The Singing Dryad was a tavern and dining hall located in the village of Snowmantle during the 14 th century DR . It was one of the few businesses that survived the occupation of the settlement by Zhentarim forces in the year 1355 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The original owner of the Dryad, Juliana Saan 's father, was killed when the Zhents took over Snowmantle. The leader of the Zhentarim, a wizard by the name of Ragnoth , transformed the establishment into a messhall for the Zhentilar troops under the command of Grimbones the Bold , to which Julianna reluctantly acquiesced. She was particularly careful not to wrong the Zhents, in order to preserve the legacy of her father.</p>
<p>In the year 1369 DR , the Dryad was frequented by a gang of Zhentilar recruiters led by the half-orc Gruel .</p>
