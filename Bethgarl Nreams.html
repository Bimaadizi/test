<p>Bethgarl Nreams was a cheese trader of Athalantar in the mid-3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>

<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He had a very squeaky cart.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>His wife was Ammuthe .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On the day after the slaying of King Belaur Aumar of Hastarl and the coronation of Helm Stoneblade as its new king, Bethgarl Nreams went to Hastarl by early morning, through a road that placed an old grave-shrine to his left on the way to Hastarl. He was startled by the sight of a ball of blue flame there, in which he saw two forms, a man and a woman engaged in some nondescript act. He decided to drop the cart and run.</p>
<p>Later he returned with his wife, who admonished him for dropping the cheeses. However, upon seeing the ball of blue flame, which was still there, she panicked, and ultimately ran away. He had since grown relaxed, and picked up his cheeses, then winked at the ball, and got startled anew as he noticed it winking back, so he made haste to get to Hastarl, where he was surprised by the commotion at the gates.</p>
