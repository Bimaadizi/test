<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tharqualnaar was founded in −458 DR as a military garrison for adult male merfolk from the north to gather tithes to Umberlee.</p>
<p>Since −334 DR , the merfolk were tasked with guarding Umberlee's Cache.</p>
<p>In 1355 DR , the population of Tharqualnaar boomed, as merfolk refugees fleeing Laakos' Reef bolstered the ranks, transforming the settlement from garrison to village.</p>
<p>The village was nearly destroyed in 1369 DR by the Army of Iakhovas in the Deepwater War , but was replenished by merfolk traveling from up and down the Sword Coast . Since that time, merfolk acted as members of the City Guard.</p>
