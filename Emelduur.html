<p>Emelduur was the name of a rich and influential family in Khôltar , south Faerûn , circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . They were one of the twenty Onsruur families— human Houses that each had a seat on the council of lords.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Emelduur bloodline favored short, supple bodies and handsome features. They were a talkative bunch with seemingly boundless energy. The children were raised on schemes and intrigue until it was second nature to them.</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>The Emelduur clan made their fortune by pushing quick deals, being first into a market, and manipulating commodities and other players to their advantage. Given the choice, they preferred the excitement of speedy transactions in a changing environment over forming a long-term plan and seeing it through.</p>
