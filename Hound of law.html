<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Hounds of law could rapidly transform themselves into various animals, such as dogs , elephants , hawks , horses , panthers , rats , sharks , and snakes . Transformed hounds of law were usually more powerful than normal animals.</p>
<p>They could move between the Astral Plane , Ethereal Plane , and Material Plane at will. They had the ability to become invisible, and would sometimes detect other invisible creatures.</p>
<p>When tracking a creature, hounds of law could sense residual magic to follow it if it used flying or teleportation magic.</p>
<p>Hounds of law were unaffected by all but a few spells, including protection from alignment , magic missile , and maze .</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Hounds of law were lawful creatures bred by the vaati. As such, they were loyal to their masters and would sometimes be sent on solitary missions. A few hounds bred by Wendeam vaati were lawful good like their masters.</p>
