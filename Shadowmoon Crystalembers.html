However, she was resurrected in Evermeet as a wild elf by Queen Amlaruil Moonflower using mysterious spells .

<p>Shadowmoon represented elves among the three members of the Elder Circle. For a long time, she led the Elder Circle under the name Shadowmoon. However, following the Spellplague of 1385 DR , which altered nature's ecosystems, Shadowmoon succumbed to a Shar -induced madness. She changed her name to "Cindermoon" and slowly descended into insanity.</p>
