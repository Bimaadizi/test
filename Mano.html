<p>Mano was a human member of the Neverwinter militia in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mano was a muscular human man with a light skin tone, chestnut hair, and scruffy face. He wore the Neverwintran militia uniform of navy blue and white colors.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the time the Wailing Death ravaged Neverwinter in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Mano was placed to guard the city gate between the districts of the City Core and Beggar's Nest , the task that was physically draining thanks to the extreme unrest in the poor district of the city. The area was stricken hard by the plague, forcing many to flee the infected area and others – left to die on the streets, their bodies – burned, and, to make matters worse, the plague awoken a zombie plague, leaving Mano defending the City Core from refuges and monsters alike. Some were allowed passage through Mano's gate though – the city guard, as well as Helmite priests who established a shrine in Beggar's Nest. He was also aware of the Shining Serpent Inn in the district where Harben Ashensmith , a friend of the city guard, was organizing the locals.</p>
