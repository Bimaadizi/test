<p>Alsapir's Rock was a tiny island in the Red Rocks in the Sea of Swords of the Sword Coast North . Notably, it was once the lair of the copper dragon Gaulauntyr , called Glorytongue.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Part of the Red Rocks archipelago, it lay just north of Waterdeep and so near the coast and Mount Sar that it was rarely marked on maps and sea charts.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>On its western side was a many-branched sea cave carved out by the waves, with tidal waters flooding its entrance. Here was where Gaulauntyr had made her lair. Although she had moved away by 1372 DR , she left behind her food source—a captive deepspawn that produced boars , deer , rothé , and sundry other prey animals to satisfy her appetite. Unfortunately, while the deepspawn kept birthing them, there was no food for them and no way out of the caves, so they simply starved and died.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It acquired its name after a fisherman called Alsapir met his death here when a storm smashed his boat against the rock.</p>
