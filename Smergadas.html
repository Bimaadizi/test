<p>Smergadas was a young adult male red dragon who attempted to settle in the Dessarin Valley , sometime before the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The young, brash Smergadas attempted to settle in the Dessarin Valley in an area very near to the town of Red Larch , having taken a liking to the region. After flying around for a day without opposition, he feasted on local deer, then landed to rest. Claugiyliamatar , unhappy with Smergadas' presence within her territory, flew out and picked up a massive boulder from the top of a mountain and dropped it on him while he slept, killing him. She then feasted on his remains.</p>
<p>The boulder, as left by Claugiyliamatar, would come to be known locally as Lance Rock .</p>
