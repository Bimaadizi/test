<p>Shadowtop was a type of common tree that grew throughout Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Shadowtops could grow to be 90 feet (27 meters) tall, growing at a rate of 2 feet (61 centimeters) per year. Their irregular, feathering leaves grew at the very top of the tree, having dark green tops and a coppery hue on the underside. The tops of Shadowtops were prone to fire.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Shadow-wood was fibrous, making it undesirable for building but good for ropemaking. The fibrous wood was good for cookfires as it burned hot and slow without giving off much smoke. Shadowtop torches, which could be purchased for 1 sp , burned longer than other wood torches and gave off less smoke.</p>
<p>Shadow-wood was used to make magical staves , rods and wands . The dagger Applebane had a shadow-wood handle.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
