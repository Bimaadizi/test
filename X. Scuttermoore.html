<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Absolute crisis of Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the Guild of Baldur's Gate targeted X. Scuttermoore, presumably as part of the Guild's protection racket or unpaid debts. When Scuttermoore began running low on coin, the Guild claimed their deposit box key from the Counting House ; however, that did not stop harassment and demands of payment by the agents of the Guild.</p>
