<p>A miscellaneous manifestation was a minor manifestation of a deity .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deities could show their powers through major manifestations and minor manifestations. A miscellaneous manifestation fell into the latter category.</p>
<p>As "miscellaneous" manifestation suggested, the term was a catch-all term for manifestations that did not fall in other categories. These smells, sounds, auras, and even possessions but also unique manifestations of a deity.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous manifestations were used by deities used to convey information, but due to their often-vague nature and reliance on interpretation, they were sometimes misunderstood.</p>
<h2>Mortals' Reaction</h2>
<p>When a follower received a unique miscellaneous manifestation, their standing among other followers of his or her faith might improve. In fact, there was a high chance for that. For example, when Shakti Hunzrin received the unique manifestation of Vhaeraun , the flitting shadow , Nisstyre became immediately convinced that he could ally with her.</p>
