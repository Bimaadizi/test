<p>The hammer pony was a breed of war pony that originated from the gold dwarf realm of the Great Rift in the Shining South . They were bred for their strength and endurance in battle and were just as comfortable underground, even in the Underdark , or above on Toril 's surface.</p>
<p>They were not well known beyond the Shaar and were not often sold beyond the dwarven trading town, Hammer and Anvil . While they were sold for 400 gp within the settlement, they could go for as much as 1200 gold pieces in a shop outside the Shaar.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Large and muscular in appearance, for a pony that is, they were able to support the full weight of a dwarf armored in plate mail . While they ranged in color from a light brown to black, they always had blonde manes and feathering around their ankles.</p>
<p>Although they would eat grass, as all horses would, their favorite food was fungus .</p>
