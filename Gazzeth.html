<p>Gazzeth , or simply the ruined orc city , was a long-abandoned ruin of a city along the coast of the Moonsea .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It lay between the city of Thentia and the Seawave ruins, and between the Ruined Trail and the shore of the Moonsea .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The name 'Gazzeth' was lost to history and, given the legend surrounding it, few in the Moonsea were eager to find it. By the mid-1300s DR, the ruins of Gazzeth were known simply as "ruined orc city".</p>
<p>Orcs from the ruined city destroyed Seawave, a nearby colony of Thentia.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Giant forms of many kinds of vermin infested the ruins as of the late 1360s DR, which kept people away. At one point, it was also inhabited by orcs .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>A legend formed around the city's forgotten name, claiming that if the name of the city was ever discovered, then its long-dead inhabitants would rise, gather into an army, and march on Thentia.</p>
<p>There were rumors in Thentia that dragons and beholders might be establishing lairs in some of the ruined cities to the east, which would include Gazzeth.</p>
