<p>House Haldoneir was a very haughty and old human noble house of Cormyr that was renowned for its historical involvement in the nation's warfare.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Members of the Haldoneir family tended to be tall and gracile people of striking beauty. They were hardy and long-lived folk who traded in warfare, and because of the battlefield loses, humble in numbers. Many speculated that the family's good and slender looks was the evidence of the Haldoneirs being more than friendly with elves in the past.</p>
<p>The family's heraldry was an image of a dragon 's head of a crocodile like maw. The dragon species was not known nor identifiable from the image. The dragon's head silhouette was black and faced left with its maw open, forked tongue extended, and breathing a jet of flames out. The image ended in a straight line that severed the head, three drops of black blood dripping from it as well as a sword that pointed horizontally to the left. The sword was known as the Wyrmdeath .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Haldoneirs were historic members of Cormyr's Purple Dragons and occasionally, reached high rank and gained trust of the Crown. At least three Haldoneirs reached the rank of Highknights – personal agents of the crown. Many generations of Haldoneirs joined the Purple Dragons, however, the numbers of serving family members greatly reduced with generations, leaving the 14 th and 15 th century DR Haldoneirs living a live of leisure, financed by the coin from their many properties in Suzail, Selgaunt , and Urmlaspyr .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The family retained Wyrmdown , a large countryside manse northeast of Immersea . Another family holding was Ormvraezel Keep , a castle with its own hunting forest and farmlands, in northwestern Sembia. The hunting lodge called the Boarhunt Towers was located in central Sembia. And the main home for the family was located in Suzail – High Oronel , as well as several secret townhouses in the capital and two apartments in Marsember .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Opposed to the Crown of Cormyr, Haldoneirs allied themselves with shady Sembian organizations such as Fire Knives and various slaver organizations. The family was not above using Fire Knives to dispose of its relatives and selling their own daughters into slavery when coin was sparse.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The family's first notable individual was Ryneth Haldoneir who lived during the reign of Ondeth Obarskyr . Ryneth was a farmer, archer , and an occasional mercenary who resided in the settlement that would eventually become Suzail . The Haldoneir family arrived to Cormyr from elsewhere and remained part of the Forest Kingdom for many centuries to follow. Despite that, the family was never known as the Dragon Throne loyalists. By the late 14 th and 15 th centuries DR , Haldoneirs were commonly known as one of the "founding families" of Cormyr and having "blood as regal as any family of the realm." In the early days of the Forest Kingdom, Haldoneirs took arms on behalf of the early Obarskyr monarches. Tales also claimed that the family was known for taming dragons in the years past, however, that was nothing but a legend, inspired by imaginative minstrels and the family's sets of scale armor and dragon's head helmets and other dragon-like adornments.</p>
<p>Haldoneirs owed their ennoblement to widow Lady Vaerestra Haldoneir , who loyally served as an advisor to King Dhalmass Obarskyr and was highly regarded by the High Wizard Jorunhast . She shielded King Dhalmas from a poisoned dagger with her own body, sacrificing her life in the process. Thankful for the deed, the monarch made the family into a noble house and gave Mreldon Haldoneir , Vaerestra soldier son, the title of the first Lord Haldoneir.</p>
<p>However, by the early part of the reign of Rhigaerd Obarskyr II , Haldoneirs became embittered over Lord Esmarl Haldoneir 's removal as the Royal Privy Advisor due to him becoming corrupt and concealing his investigation's from the Crown in exchange for bribes. Since Esmarl's fall from grace, the Haldoneirs became some of the most avid proponents of such claims as Obarskyrs not being true rulers of Cormyr, and that they were nothing but old-blood family that took the throne through lies and immoral actions. In the 14 th century DR, the family's attitude towards the crown was well known through royal spies and Vangerdahast Aeiulvana , the Royal Magician. As such, House Haldoneir was cut off from the King's Court and the family was largely ignored. The only reason, according to truthful rumors, why the family had not been stripped of their nobility was due to at least two Haldoneir ladies begging King Azoun not to disgrace their family. One of them was Lady Aglathna Haldoneir of whom king was very found of. Her successor, Lady Ulandra Haldoneir , was also instrumental as she became a close friend of King Azoun's. Despite his affections, King Azoun also had Vangerdahast enspell his loins so none of his proclivities with Ladies Haldoneir resulted in an Obarskyr bastard.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, the Haldoneir Family were stagnant, enjoying lives of luxury and hedonism. They lived off the real estate coin and spent it on mistresses and brightlads, participated in many voguish cults, conspiracies, and business fads that failed and went our of fashion more often than not. They were also known for sponsoring merchants and cabals who sought to evade the crown's rule and groups that fostered seditious intents. The Haldoneir numbers were also kept in check thanks to common feuds among themselves, resulting in assassinations.</p>
