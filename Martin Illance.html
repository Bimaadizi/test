<p>Martin Frayault Illance was a member of the Illance noble family of Cormyr in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>With the good looks of the Illance men, Martin was darkly handsome and among the most attractive of the young men at the Royal Court in the late 1360s DR, but some thought he had teeth that were too big and incisors too pointy, and smiled too much for them.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Martin was capable of displaying charm and wit, while also pretending to be self-effacing and able to fade into the background and listen in on conversations. He was a womanizer.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>To arrest the declining fortunes and influence of the Illances, Martin was considered to be the best hope of the family. Though he clearly tried to turn his good looks into an asset and made advances toward various women at court, many noble families warned their eligible daughters to avoid him, and both princesses spurned him. Duke Bhereu even considered him "the most untrustworthy young noble in the kingdom" and Baron Thomdor described him as "that proud flower of the Illance line" and didn't like him, while gossips like Blaerla Roaringhorn called him a "popinjay". Regardless, it seemed inevitable that someone would fall for him and marry despite family interests or good sense.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Martin Frayault was named for the traditional family name Frayault and for his grandmother Delamartina Illance , in order to distinguish him from his uncle Frayault Illance .</p>
<p>Some time before 1367 DR , Martin Illance attempted to seduce Crown Princess Tanalasta Obarskyr but she saw through his attempts and rejected him. He then immediately turned his attention to Tanalasta's younger sister Alusair Obarskyr , but she had already been warned about him by Tanalasta, who'd told him all his favourite lines. Alusair threw him through a window, his fall broken only by a table, which left him with a dislocated shoulder. He would later insist that he had sustained the injury during a barroom brawl.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Martin was involved in the abraxus affair , and joined those who supported Aunadar Bleth in his bid to usurp the Dragon Throne. Arriving in the Hall of the Dragon Throne, he subtly threatened to draw his sword on the defiant Cat Wyvernspur . The attempt failed, and Martin's fate is unknown [ speculation ] but he remained alive by 1372 DR .</p>
