<p>Cheese was a form of preserved milk , derived from the solid portions of curdled milk being separated from the liquid (whey), that was prepared in a variety of ways. The color, flavor, marbling, and texture of cheese all varied depending upon how it was prepared. It was a product widely available in Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>Cheese was most often found in 1‑pound (450‑gram) circular or elliptic wheels, or in rectangular loaves, which could then be divided further in wedges, or hunks. Some cheeses could also be found in large 100‑pound (45‑kilogram) wheys, for example when ordered in bulk from Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue .</p>
<p>In Scornubel , cheese was often sold in chunks known as a "fist".</p>
