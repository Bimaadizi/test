<p>The Matsutomo clan were a samurai family in Wa and the leaders of Aru Province on and off through the 1600s and 1700s on the Wa Calendar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Wa Year 1608 (1190 DR) , the shogun Eiko officially recognized the settlement of Aru and decreed it the capital of the new Aru Province. Choosing the completely loyal Matsutomo clan to lead it, he appointed the clan head Arata Matsutomo as its first daimyo ; the Matsutomos dutifully relocated to Aru. Arata served ably for two decades, until Wa Year 1627 (1209 DR) , when bandits aided by unidentified supernatural creatures ( tengu being one possibility) massacred a large pilgrim train in one of the mountain passes. The shogun reprimanded Arata for this failure of security. The next year , Arata's samurai guarded the next pilgrim train, but they too were attacked and slaughtered to a man. The shogun removed Arata and the Matsutomos from power, passing the province to the Toda clan.</p>
<p>The shogun returned Aru to the Matsutomo clan in Wa Year 1640 (1222 DR) , now under Koji Matsutomo. A weak man, Koji was liked by peasants but hated by rival nobles who'd moved to Aru. He survived two attempted coups in Wa Year 1645 (1227 DR) and Wa Year 1649 (1231 DR) , and thereafter focused only on protecting himself and his clan. As a result, he neglected the province's administration and corruption got out of control. When in Wa Year 1652 (1234 DR) the annual shipment of tax payments at Uwaji was 30% less than reported on the manifest, Koji and the Matsutomos were removed, with the province passed to the Kubahachi clan.</p>
<p>The daimyate went back to the Matsutomos in Wa Year 1717 (1299 DR) . Vowing to do better, Masakito Matsutomo was efficient and enlightened, if strict, but too old to reign for long. He died in Wa Year 1725 (1307 DR) and was succeeded by his son, Hisao. Hisao lacked his father's wisdom and corruption flourished in Aru Province again. Many of his advisors established their own "business interests", most egregiously charging pilgrims a "visitation fee" to worship at the Shining Temple of Bishamon . When the shogun heard of his violation of tradition, the Matsutomos were removed again in Wa Year 1730 (1312 DR) .</p>
<p>In Wa Year 1758 (1340 DR) , shogun Matasuuri Nagahide returned the daimyate once again to the Matsutomos. Benju Matsutomo , a renowned samurai and one of Nagahide's generals, governed well but as he grew older he worried about his family's future. Deciding his ancestors' failures resulted from overambition, he resolved to be as quiet, safe, unobtrusive, and error-free as he could, hoping that if the Matsutomos could hold the daimyate for a few generations, they might achieve a better position. He remained in power through Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR) .</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Regularly removed from power for one failure or another, the Matsutomos had a history of bad luck and even shame with regards to the province. One rumor even claimed—falsely—that it was a curse, insisting that Aru would suffer whenever a Matsutomo became daimyo.</p>
<h2>Home</h2>
<p>When they were in power as daimyos of Aru Province, the Matsutomos lived in its capital, the town of Aru , at the daimyo's donjon in the Castle District. Some family members lived there, but the daimyo's wife and children lived in a yashiki in Wa's capital, Uwaji , as effective hostages of the shogun.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>A family heirloom was a katana of quality make. It had been in the family for ten generations by the time Benju wielded it.</p>
