<p>Rings of youth were magical rings that could be found in Zakhara , the Land of Fate.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Any wearer of these rings only aged at one-third of the normal rate. These rings were usable by any class. These rings only slowed the aging time from the moment they were put on. Removal of the ring would bring the aging time back to normal, but the wearer did not rapidly age from the time since they first donned the ring.</p>
