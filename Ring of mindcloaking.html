<p>A ring of mindcloaking was a magic item , similar to a ring of mind shielding , that protected the wearer from a variety of effects, no matter if they were psionic or magical in nature. Unlike the ring of mind shielding , however, a ring of mindcloaking was able to project false information in response to the probing, appearing as if the wearer's mind was unguarded.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A ring of mindcloaking protected the wearer from a greater number of phenomena than a ring of mind shielding . The psionic discipline of ESP was one such example, as were spells that allowed one to know alignment , detect evil , or even detect lies , but this was not necessarily an exhaustive list. A ring of mindcloaking wielded by a sufficiently experienced wearer could then be used to present different thoughts and an altered alignment â€”this not only blocked, but actively deceived, any attempts to divine the contents of their user's mind.</p>
<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
<p>Rings of mindcloaking were in frequent use among the more influential members of the Kraken Society , a mysterious information network that operated primarily in the Savage North and nearby Trackless Sea . Prior to his death, Alahar Khaumfros , a member of the group and Waterbaron of Yartar , was one wearer of such a ring .</p>
