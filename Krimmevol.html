<p>Krimmevol was a wide-reaching family from Amn that achieved great political and mercantile power.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The family had most of its interests in the field of running caravans, and to that effect owned the majority of the land in Crimmor, and owned nearly half of the businesses that dealt with caravans. Unlike some other families, the Krimmevols actively supported the elected mayor of the city and kept politics from ever upsetting the peaceful and profitable economics in play. The family also held a large amount of influence in Eshpurta , with Jharvex Krimmevol sitting on the Shield Council for several decades. Their significant interests in Riatavin were controlled by Mundal Krimmevol , who came to control a quarter of all caravan-related business in the city.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The primary family estate was Crystalgates Manor in the city of Crimmor , with secondary ones in Athkatla and Riatavin .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Krimmevols in Amn had good relationships with the Crytrapper , Coprith , and Zoar families, and lacked any real enemies among the domain's mercantile houses.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Krimmevols were descended from the rulers of the duchy of Cortryn , a realm neighboring Amn that was absorbed in the 8 th century DR .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Wailing Winds, 1000 DR , the Krimmevol family joined the Spulzeer and Coprith families in the founding of Riatavin. The leading figure of the operation was Riatan Krimmevol , who gave his name to the new settlement.</p>
<p>By the mid–14 th century DR, the Krimmevols were one of the most powerful families in Amn, controlling vast swathes of business and trade in many of its cities and influencing the politics heavily.</p>
<p>Following the secession of Riatavin in 1370 DR , the Krimmevols sought to normalize trade between the two realms and have a new duchy formed around it—either as part of Tethyr or as an independent realm, with Mundal Krimmevol as the duke. By supporting Pehllus Tanislove 's plot to become King of Amn, they hoped to reform the duchy of Cortryn as an autonomous entity. Through this, the Krimmevols would ultimately control most overland trade between Amn and Tethyr, making them even more rich and powerful. They attempted to achieve this with their own influence, as well as with the Knights of the Shield through Lady Ninvara Krimmevol 's relationship with Lord Bly Ruldegost .</p>
<h3>Krimmevols of Ithmong</h3>
<p>Artek Krimmevol 's branch of the family was exiled from Amn and pursued by assassins, arriving in Ithmong in Tethyr just after the Ten Black Days of Eleint in the Year of the Bright Blade, 1347 DR . They claimed a fortified stone building and made it into Krimmevol Hall , but Artek and his son Dyotor were killed by assassins within four years, leaving Jyordan in charge of the family as a teen. Within a decade, the family was established as the leading blacksmiths and weaponsmiths of the city, with Jyordan building a close personal friendship and business relationship with Julian Gallowglass , son of Lord-Mayor Ernest Gallowglass .</p>
<p>Their fortune turned foul again with the Reclamation Wars in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , as Jyordan had by chance sold weapons to Yusef Jhannivvar just before he began his own bid for the throne. Jyordan gave assistance to Zaranda during her siege of Ithmong, betraying his long friendship with Julian Gallowglass, but then flipped once more when his trade partners in Myratma were threatened by Zaranda's forces. Jyordan, his three brothers, and their 14 sons took to the streets of Ithmong on the Night of Cold Claws and started killing all who called Zaranda their Queen. They killed scores of innocents before guardsmen contained them and the Purple Warlock suddenly appeared. The wizard turned nine Krimmevols to stone (creating the famous Krimmevol Court ), slew four with fire, and cut the hands off the remaining five using a blade barrier . The situation resolved, the Purple Warlock vanished and the Krimmevols were taken into custody.</p>
<p>The surviving men were transported to the Cloister of St. Ramedar , where they attempted to escape repeatedly over several weeks. Errilam managed to escape over the walls and fall to his death at the bottom of the cliff, but the remainder were sentenced to death as traitors, and subjected to hanging and drawing-and-quartering. Those Krimmevols who partook in quieter crimes against the realm were banished to Trademeet in Marpenoth of the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , while the uninvolved members of the family were allowed to remain in Tethyr and practice their trades as before, with many becoming official Royal Blacksmiths and Krimmevol Hall becoming a royal guard armory. Though innocent, many of the women of the family chose to exile themselves back to Amn and take up quiet religious lives in penance for their sons' and husbands' crimes. Some went to serve the Church of Waukeen in Murann and Esmeltaran , two went to Loviatar , and three became priests of Cyric .</p>
