<p>The cragwardens were defenders of the ancient dwarven stronghold of Highhome on Gwynneth in the Moonshae Isles . These dwarves were accordingly known by the title of Cragwarden .</p>
<h2>History</h2>

By the late 15 th century DR , only a small retinue of cragwardens remained in Highhome as the last guardians of their ancient fastness.</p>
