<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The gnome had swept-back blonde hair and wore a suit of scale mail armor. He fought with a greatsword that was similar in height to him.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Gimblebock led a band of looters including Andorn , Barton , Cefrey , Haseid , Mari , Quelenna , Taman , Torgga , and Warryn . They tried to break into an ancient crypt near the shore of the River Channath . During their excavation, a nautiloid crashed close by, and the gnome immediately laid claim to it. Taman argued with him, saying they didn't know for sure what the nature of the crashed object was, but Gimblebock was sure that it was a ship.</p>
