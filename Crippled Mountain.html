<p>The Crippled Mountain , originally known as the Celestial Mountain , was a volcano located in Skelkor , Laerakond .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Celestial Mountain was the lair of the red dragon Rhodrolytharnestrix , the most powerful of the dragon tyrants of Abeir . To kill Rhodrolytharnestrix, the dragonborn rebels Iskdara , Shurideh , Reshvemi , and Thuchir went to the interior of the volcano during the Battle of the Crippled Mountain , and using a powerful artifact known as the Eye of Blazing Rorn , triggered a powerful eruption that destroyed the mountain. Since then, the mountain became known as the Crippled Mountain.</p>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>The ash from the eruption fell for forty days, and the dragonborn began to call themselves the " vayemniri " (Ash-Marked Ones, in draconic ), so that they would always remember the way they gained their freedom. Likewise, Clan Verthisathurgiesh , one of the most powerful clans of Tymanther , was named after the Crippled Mountain.</p>
