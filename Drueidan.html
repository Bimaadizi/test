<p>Druidic was the secret language of druids .</p>
<h2>Speakers</h2>
<p>All druids were taught Druidic, and they were forbidden to teach the language to anyone who was not a druid.</p>
<h2>Script</h2>
<p>Druidic made use of its own alphabetic script.</p>
<h2>Sublanguages</h2>
<p>Druidic was actually a language subgroup composed of two distinct but similar languages. The vast majority of druids spoke Drueidan ; those from the Moonshaes spoke a language called Daelic .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Drueidan was developed by a powerful group of druids who worshiped Silvanus . Silvanus made an agreement with the other nature gods of the Faerûnian pantheon to allow druids all over Faerûn to speak it.</p>
<p>Daelic, on the other hand, was developed by druids who worshiped the Earthmother .</p>
