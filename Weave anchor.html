<p>A weave anchor was a mortal being, object, or a place that was invested with part of the divine essence of Mystra . Such entities served to stabilize the Weave should anything happen to the goddess.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Creation of the anchors was imposed upon Mystra by Ao the overgod, in order to keep the goddess's power in check and to increase the stability of the world.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Rune Lords Triumphant, 1487 DR , High Prince Telamont Tanthul began a campaign to seek out the weave anchors of Faer√ªn , in order to drain their energy and aid Shar with her efforts to destroy the Weave.</p>
<p>That same year, Storm Silverhand , Elminster Aumar , and his granddaughter Amarune Whitewave traveled across the Western Heartlands seeking out lingering magical wards , so that they could help create new ones and strengthen the Weave. Ultimately, Elminster joined Laeral and Alustriel Silverhand , along with the Srinshee to destroy the anchor at Myth Drannor to prevent it from being corrupted and keep safe the city's people.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Weave anchors stabilized the Weave around them, causing antimagic fields , dead-magic zones , and disjunction effects (like Mordenkainen's disjunction ) to fail around them. They were also one of the reasons the Weave didn't collapse completely during the Spellplague .</p>
<p>Weave anchors kept a connection to the Weave even when they left Realmspace , allowing Mystra to communicate with them and to see through them. They also had a tendency to live longer than the usual lifespan of their kin, and to escape death against the odds.</p>
<p>It was possible to create new weave anchors at locations that had been magically warded .</p>
