<p>A jar of preserving was a type of enchanted jar that allowed for one to preserve any type of material indefinitely.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These jars were round in shape and made of glass , with glass lids that screwed into place. They weighed around 2 pounds (910 grams) and could hold up to 2‒7 gal (0.0076‒0.026 m³) of liquid or 0.27‒1 ft³ (0.0076‒0.028 m³) of material.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A jar of preserving put any type of material or small creature that was placed within it into a state of suspended animation. This meant that any plant matter would never wilt or rot; creatures would never age, hunger, or thirst; and spell components would never lose their potency. Some later versions were found to lack the capacity to keep creature's alive, but kept their corpses from rotting.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Creating a jar of preserving often required use of the spell gentle repose .</p>
