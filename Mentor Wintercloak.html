<h2>History</h2>

<p>As a member of the Incanists' Society , Mentor helped found and direct the Incanistaeum magic school. In the Year of Austere Ceremonies, 667 DR , he was the only human member of the early Council of Twelve .</p>
<p>From 426 DR to 440 DR Mentor tutored the young Khelben Arunsun (at that time still unnamed). In the Year of the Hunting Ghosts, 659 DR , Mentor also tutored the young Uthgardt mage Tulrun . During this period, Mentor was believed to have collected new spells created by his apprentices in a tome titled The Wizards' Workbook , which found its way into the possession of the wizard Flamsterd of the Moonshaes , who scribed a copy for his friend Elminster .</p>
