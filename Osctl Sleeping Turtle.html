<p>Osctl Sleeping Turtle was a ruler in Far Payit in Maztica .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Osctl was one of the seven cheitains in the Ixtzul valley when the Star Worm fell from the sky. He was the first to reach the creature, still encased in a meteorite, and intended to make a bargain with the creature so he could gain power.</p>
<p>What happened afterward was unknown, except that the Star Worm was bound in a magical slumber. The city of Ixtzul was founded by Osctl's tribe over where it slept, and he became the first Revered Counselor of Ixtzul. By claiming that he had made a bargain with the Star Worm and it was their protector, the tribe gained power over the other tribes.</p>
