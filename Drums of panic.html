<p>Drums of panic were a variety of magical kettle drums that induced a state of fear in nearby creatures.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Largely unremarkable in appearance, these drums always came in pairs and had hemispheres of 1​ to ​1.5 feet (0.3​ to ​0.46 meters) in diameter. Each of these drums weighed around 5 pounds (2,300 grams).</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These drums emitted a moderate aura of necromantic magic. Once per day, when both of the kettle drums within a drums of panic pair were played they would induce a state of panic in all creatures within 120 feet (37 meters), though those within a 20 feet (6.1 meters) of the drums would be unaffected, this area acting as a "safe zone". When played in the hands of a proper bard , however, the radius of this inner "safe zone" could be reduced to any radius they desired. Additionally, when played underwater the effective range of drums of panic doubled to 240 feet (73 meters).</p>
<p>Those who succumbed to the magic would attempt to flee as fast as possible in the opposite direction of the drums. Creatures within an animal-level of intelligence were more susceptible to the effect. Additionally, it was much harder for creatures to resist the effects of drums of panic played in the hands of a bard, with its power to effect the mind scaling with a bard's skills.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Turning a pair of kettle drums into drums of panic required a spellcaster with skills in crafting wondrous items and the spell fear .</p>
