<p>Rings of flinging were enchanted rings that improved the wearer's skills and aim with flinging and throwing.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Some of these rings were bands inlaid with rubies . The ring made the wearer stronger and more powerful when throwing things at their opponents, dealing increased damage.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Historically, rings of flinging were used by organizations like the Harpers , who often preferred to stay out of a blade's reach and often found themselves chasing or being chased across the rooftops during moonlit nights. These rings allowed the Harper agents to end wrongdoers with good aim and a loose roof tile. In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , one such ring was being offered for sale by Arron , a lightfoot halfling druid traders of the Emerald Grove in the Western Heartlands .</p>
