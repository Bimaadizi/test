<p>The Giant's Folly was a festhall in the village of Reddansyr on the Dragon Coast . It was run by the successful tavern-owner, Gandios Laffabar who turned a lost wager into a new opportunity.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Giant's Folly was located inside an overturned boat, an unusual site that played a role in how the bar earned its interesting name.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point in his life, Gandios made a wager with a fire giant involving a boat being pulled inland from the port city of Westgate to Reddansyr. While the giant won the first bet, the pair made another bet for ownership of the boat itself, which wound up in Gandios' favor. After emerging victorious in the end, Gandios opened the festhall he could call his own, thus the Giant's Folly was born.</p>
<p>The Giant's Folly was so successful as of the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR that Gandios considered having a second boat pulled in from Westgate, specifically by another giant .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Gian's Folly became known as an information clearing-house, which rather annoyed the local chapel of Oghma .</p>
