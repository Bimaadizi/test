<p>Mount Nar was a massive mountain in the Firward Mountains of Narfell . Its perpetually snowcapped peak was visible across most of that realm.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The huge, rugged mountain with its bluish glaciers was a dominant feature across the plains of Narfell. The mountain was clearly visible as far away as N'Jast , and as of the mid–15 th century DR , the ruins on the western side of the mountain were visible from Bildoobaris .</p>
<p>Mount Nar's glaciers dominated its western and northern slopes and extended all the way to the mountain's base. In the summer, meltwater from the mountain fed the streams around Bildoobaris, signaling the start of the Trade Fair .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In ancient times, the capital of the Nar kingdom of Jastaath was located atop Mount Nar, and their powerful demonbinders altered the weather to make the mountain warm and hospitable. However, after the kingdom was abandoned, the mountain became covered in snow and ice, and the ruins of Jastaath became lost beneath the snows. The kingdom came to be remembered only in archaic texts and local legends.</p>
<p>As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, the mountain was the domain of Kryonar , a white dragon dracolich who murdered anyone who approached the peak. Kryonar was so feared that no Nars dared to scale the mountain.</p>
<p>Beginning in the mid–15 th century DR, the ruins atop the mountain had been claimed by Branimern Rythil , who slew Kryonar and sought to uncover the ancient secrets of Jastaath to enable her to conquer the surrounding lands. She constructed for herself a towering stronghold amidst the old ruins high on the western slope, and beginning around the Year of the Silent Tear, 1439 DR , this structure was visible from Bildoobaris.</p>
