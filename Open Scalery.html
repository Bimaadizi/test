<p>The Open Scalery was a fishmongery in the city of Ravens Bluff .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Open Scalery was a one story building made of clay brick with a tiled roof.</p>
<h3>Interior</h3>
<p>The front half of this building served as the store, while the rear half of it served as the living space for its owners. The store front also opened to old storage room which had been enchanted to maintain a temperature of 58 â„‰ . Within a barrel of dried fish in this room the proprietors hid most of their wealth.</p>
<p>The front of the building was decorated with all manner of nautical paraphernalia, including nets and tarred ropes . There was a brine trough, where fish were cured before being dried, and a counter where the store's goods were sold. The counter had a glass front and shelves for displaying the day's catch. Sitting atop it were a balance scale and a cutting board.</p>
<p>The living quarters of the building consisted of three bedrooms, a parlor, and a kitchen. The parlor featured a fireplace with a hidden niche, wherein some of their coins were hidden, as well as a variety of weapons on display. These included two cutlasses , a longsword , a shortbow , and two quivers full of arrows .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Open Scalery sold a variety of seafood. It operated six days a week, from late morning until sunset. The store's prices were relatively reasonable and the proprietors were willing to haggle. Though they were not above fixing the price by holding their thumb on the scale while a customer was distracted by Kira.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>This store was lived in and run by Leif and Kira Alltbeir , the heads of the Fishmongers Association . It was also lived in by their two children, Eric and Sheila , though they worked elsewhere.</p>
<p>Leif handled the business of buying fish, doing so each day in the late afternoon, while his wife handled most of the selling.</p>
