<p>King Seltarir was the ruler of Estagund in the Shining South during the 11 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Seltarir became king of Estagund when his older brother, King Selkarin , died during an invasion of Dambrath before producing a son. Seltarir inherited a country where most of the young fighting men had perished in failed invasions of neighboring countries. Famine was also a serious problem at this time, resulting in Seltarir making a trade with a wealthy merchant named Jeradeem , exchanging his crown for diamonds worth nearly one million gold pieces . This new-found wealth gave him a seat on the Shining Lands ' Council of Merchants and led to the formation of Chaka Seltarir .</p>
