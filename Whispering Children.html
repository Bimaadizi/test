<p>The Whispering Children were twenty-two powerful artifacts in the form of portraits. In reality, they were the transformed demipower children of the god Oghma . The paintings were referred to as Whispering Children because they whispered secrets to those nearby.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Shortly after ascending to godhood, Oghma fathered many demipower children. A few of his children decided to each specialize in an area of knowledge of their choosing. But twenty-two of the children were turned away from Oghma by Cyric , who transformed them into paintings. The goddess Mystra attempted to take the paintings from Cyric but he scattered the paintings across Faer√ªn and most were lost. Lord Kasdrian Norjah of the noble House Norjah of Airspur managed to collect seven of the Whispering Children by the late 15 th century DR . The knowledge held by the Whispering Children was dangerous even to the gods, especially to Oghma.</p>
