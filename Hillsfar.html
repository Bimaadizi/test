<p>Hillsfar was a powerful city-state located on the southern coast of the Moonsea . The city was heavily involved in trade in the region, acting as a hub for cities and settlements in the surrounding area. A person from Hillsfar was known as a Hillfarian.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<h3>Laws</h3>
<p>In the late 14th century DR , the city of Hillsfar was ruled by the iron fist of the wizard Maalthiir and there were two standing "great laws":</p>
<p>By the late 15th century DR, the city was ruled by a senate of thirty-one wealthy merchants and guildmasters. However, since the senate could rarely agree on anything, actual rule of the city fell to the First Lord Torin Nomerthal .</p>
<h2>Defense</h2>
<p>Although Hillsfar was a walled city, fortified with a steel gate, it was the military force of the Red Plumes who ensured the city's security from foreign forces in the 14th century DR. Although they technically operated autonomously, they were in fact another extension of Maalthiir's reach.</p>
<p>In the 15th century DR, the military was known as the Tower Guard and was supplemented by a powerful mages guild.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Although trade in the Moonsea was typically carried out through rivalries and competition, almost all the goods of the region passed through Hillsfar in the hands of middlemen and intermediary merchants. The city was once a port where stolen and illicit goods were traded (despite Hillsfar having a law that stated piracy was punishable by hanging), but this was no longer the case by 1359 DR . Hillsfar was a known exporter of velvet.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Founding & Early History</h3>
<p>The settlement was founded in the Year of the Covenant, 673 DR by elves , half-elves , and humans on the western edge of Tailings Bay . It was originally named Hillsafar after a dwarven clan , but within a few decades, the name was simplified to Hillsfar. The city was founded for three reasons: to trade with the dwarven settlers who had emigrated out of Myth Drannor the previous year to the Scarp at Tailings Bay; to keep drow out of the region; and to maintain a watch over Moander's Crypt . The city was ruled over by council of men and half-elves, as well as representatives of the Elven Court , giving the Elven Court a measure of control over Hillsfar.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Scarlet Sash, 679 DR , an army of monsters spawned by deepspawn that emerged from the Beast Marches almost destroyed the city.</p>
<p>Some time after 913 DR , Rauthauvyr "the Raven" used political pressure on the Elven Court to allow the construction of a road connecting the Sembian city of Ordulin to Hillsfar, thus securing the riches of the Moonsea for Sembia's financial future.</p>
<h3>14 th Century DR</h3>
<p>In the Year of Thunder, 1306 DR , Hillsfar fought and defeated Mulmaster in the Moonsea War alongside Melvaunt , Phlan , Sembia and Zhentil Keep .</p>
<p>In Kythorn of the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR , during the Flight of dragons that afflicted the region, the largest dragon of the flight attacked Hillsfar and, although slain by the city's defenders, fell into Hillsfar's harbor, blocking it from approaching ships until the corpse could be destroyed. A month later, in Flamerule, Hillsfar joined the military alliance of Cormyr , the Dalelands , Sembia , and Zhentil Keep to oppose the forces of Lashan Aumersair .</p>
<p>In 1357 DR Maalthiir overthrew the city's ruling council using blackmail and fear of violence. He then declared himself the First Lord, a position with absolute military power, which he retained through the violent mercenary group known as the Red Plumes. Extending his own xenophobic tendencies, Maalthiir then banned all non-humans from the city. The Red Plume mercenaries were especially hard on the halfling population, considering them all thieves. Every single halfling was thrown out of the city with extreme prejudice. The Mercenaries came for them in the middle of the night, forcing the halflings out without a chance to bring the valuables or sell their land and businesses. This event gave the Red Plumes the name of Red Death among the halfling folk.</p>
<p>In 1360 DR , Hillsfar was involved in the Cormyr-led military alliance to defeat the invading Grand Army of the Tuigan , though they ended up only sending 600 men, mostly Red Plumes, to actually take part in the fighting.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , a pool of radiance emerged in Hillsfar's harbor, starting to aggressively consume lives of the city's residents . The spawn pool originated from the ruined city of Myth Drannor where it was corrupted and abused by the Cult of the Dragon . Kya Mordrayn 's cult cell spread tentacles of her corrupted pool , feeding it in cities across the Moonsea , empowering it. Subsequently the Cult's plans were shattered and its leaders slain by the Veiled Ones . With the main pool of radiance gone, Hillsfar was saved.</p>
<p>The following summer, a secret alliance was exposed between Maalthiir and the Sembian government when Sembia was found to be propping up Hillsfar's independence from Zhentil Keep .</p>
<h3>15 th Century DR</h3>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , a new periodical publication called Beldrouk's Bright Banners appeared in Hillsfar, quickly becoming favorite for its blunt political commentaries that voiced off against the Red Plumes and Hillsfar's cruel leadership. The paper's anonymous contributors were announced wanted criminals by Hillsfar but even the publisher and printer remained unknown.</p>
