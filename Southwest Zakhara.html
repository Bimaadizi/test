<p>Wild southwest Zakhara comprised a number of uncivilized islands in the western part of the Crowded Sea . Most of them were part of one of the two archipelagoes of Jazayir al-Sartan and the Djinni's Claws .</p>
<h2>Geographic limits</h2>
<p>To the north , the tip of al-Suqut Mountains and al-Tarik Islands bordered southwest Zakhara within the Pearl Cities region. In the east , the Nada al-Hazan and Steaming Isles archipelagoes were its neighbors. To the south lay the Islands of the Utter South and beyond the endless waves of the Southern Ocean , while to the west uncounted leagues of the Great Sea separated it from the lands south of Maztica .</p>
<h2>Jazayir al-Sartan</h2>
<p>The verdant Isles of the Crab formed a crab-shaped archipelago. They were settled by only a few enlightened Zakharans, but home to monsters and savage tribes of halflings , humans , ogres , and ogre magi , as well as the dreadful sartani .</p>
<h2>The Djinni's Claws</h2>
<p>The jungle-covered island chain of the Djinni's Claws, roughly in the shape of a lower arm and hand, was a dangerous place for any outsider. While the northern islands of Yadd al-Djinni and larger Kaff were inhabited by pirates, monsters, and undead , the southern isles of al-Zira were supposed to be the territory of the marids , but dao and djinn also dwelt there.</p>
