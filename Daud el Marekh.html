<p>Daud yn Khadil el Marekh was the last bakkal of the Marekh Dynasty and the First Age of Calimshan .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Daud was originally a ship captain, but when the Sunrise Plague of −3332 DR wiped out nearly the entire population of Calimport , this left him as the surviving heir of his family.</p>
<p>Daud ruled as bakkal for twelve years, but his power grew weaker and weaker, as few were willing to live in the former capital of Calimshan after the plague.</p>
