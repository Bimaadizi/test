<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The few survivors who encountered Xenz all described him differently and often forgot the details from his attack.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Xenz raided from his ship the Beauty's Eye , rarely leaving survivors in his wake. Any village he raided was utterly sacked with the population enslaved.

His reluctance to step foot onto Dragonisle and Immurk's Hold kept him from ruling over the whole of the Pirate Isles.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Xenz was rumored to be allied with Zhentil Keep . His complete control over all who joined his ranks lead many to believe magic was being used to control the minds of his followers.</p>
