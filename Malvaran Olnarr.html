<h2>Activities</h2>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Who he reported to was unknown to the drow replacing Inder Dunseltree as of 1369 DR . He considered Inder a business rival.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Malvaran Olnarr was one of the guests at Halonder Eldeglut 's party on 1369 DR where the latter was drugged, captured and seized by drow infiltrators wishing to replace him with an imposter. He flirted with Namra Dunseltree , who was actually Qilué Veladorn , who had in turn replaced the drow that had taken the woman's place. She inquired briefly with her husband as to who she was flirting with; Malvaran was quick to inject himself into the conversation, though he did so in good cheer.</p>
