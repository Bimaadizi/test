<p>Ferrous dragons were a type of dragon distinguished typically by the color and composition of their scales, that was like that of various ferrous metals, hence the name. Though they were a mix of good, neutral, and evil, the majority had an evil alignment. Despite them being the same type of dragon, many hated each other. Ferrous dragons did not have a central deity they worshiped, and instead followed the commands and orders of Gruaghlothor.</p>
<h2>Types</h2>
<p>Although there were originally 12 ferrous dragon species before the Iron Wars, the following species are the only ones still known to be alive:</p>
<p>Chromium dragons</p>
<p>Cobalt dragons</p>
<p>Iron dragons</p>
<p>Nickel dragons</p>
<p>Tungsten dragons</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>A very high majority of ferrous dragons are lawful and follow a hierarchy amongst their species created by Gruaghlothor, where the most powerful dragon species has more importance and superiority than others below them. From highest to lowest: iron, chromium, cobalt, tungsten, and nickel. Ferrous dragons also have families. A few families can come together to join a clan lead by the most power member. All the clans of a ferrous dragon species are then lead by a greatwyrm, who reports directly to Gruaghlothor.</p>
<p>The tungsten and evil dragons all hate each other, but they must follow Gruaghlothor’s wishes and thus refrain from combat amongst themselves. Because of their current situation, survival of the ferrous dragons is the highest priority and fighting other ferrous dragons isn’t tolerated.</p>
<p>The ferrous dragons all view metallic dragons in different ways. The evil dragons see metallics as abominations they must destroy. Neutral ferrous dragons feel indifferent about metallic dragons, and simply accept their existence. Good aligned ferrous dragons see metallic dragons as the purest form of metal. Despite these views, all ferrous dragons revile chromatic dragons. Gem dragons and ferrous dragons are generally good with each other and get along well, especially with amethyst and emerald dragons.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Ferrous dragons had more iron concentrations in their blood than other dragons. This gave them an innate power to sense metals, but also made them drawn to them. Some ferrous dragons were even able to subsist completely off of metals.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before Humanoids populated the world and there were only dragons, ferrous dragons were the most powerful and dominant dragon species. A war eventually broke out, still before Humanoids , that would mark ferrous dragons till the end of times. Called the Iron Wars, at least 12 species of ferrous dragons fought for centuries. Two unnamed ferrous dragon species were brought to extinction because of the war. The war ended shortly after the Nickel dragons joining Gruaghlothor’s side. The other 5 ferrous dragons that hadn’t joined their rightful ruler fled after the war ended, their fate unknown. Ferrous dragons oddly stay quiet when asked about them. Postwar, Gruaghlothor put his wishes out that all ferrous dragon must avoid fighting, despite how much they hate each other, should their species continue to exist.</p>
<h2>Notable</h2>
<p>Gruaghlothor - The ruler of all ferrous dragons and the first ferrous dragon to ever exist.</p>
