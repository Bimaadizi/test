<p>The moonlight glaive was an enchanted Selûnite weapon that once belonged to Dame Aylin , a daughter of Selûne in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The moonlight glaive was a magic polearm that glowed, illuminating an area of 20 feet (6.1 meters) around it. It also possessed a strong +2 enchantment that strengthened the weapons and guided the blade toward its targets. The moonlight glaive also dealt additional radiant damage with each slash. The wielder could also unleash the moonlight butterflies with a swing of the glaive. This magic summoned a vortex of illusory butterflies that glowed with Selûne's pale light. Swarmed by the magical insects, creatures trapped inside their area were made much easier to attack and suffered psychic damage.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The moonlight glaive belonged to the Nightsong , Dame Aylin, who was imprisoned in the Shadowfell by Shar in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . Aylin was ready to gift the powerful Selûnite glaive to those who would free her from the ancient prison.</p>
