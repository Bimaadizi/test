<p>Imaskari kamas were exotic weapons enchanted with the ability to cause acid damage. They may have been created by the Imaskari , given the tainted aura they showed, but rather probably were modeled after Imaskari devices.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Besides being enchanted, imaskari kamas dealt as much acid damage as they dealt slashing. Though most were modest in magical strength, a few found in the Underdark were of a might that trascended, almost twice over, some of the most powerful magical weapons available.</p>
