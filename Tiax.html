<p>Tiax was a wandering cleric of Cyric who wandered west Faerûn during the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Not nearly as mad as his god, but insane nonetheless, Tiax claimed that Cyric had granted him visions of world domination. He made it his life's mission to fulfill those visions by attempting to create a worldwide theocracy in Cyric's name. Tiax was not very successful in this endeavor, but it did not stop him from reminding everyone whom he met of his goal. Over and over again.</p>
<p>He always referred to himself by name and spoke in the third person perspective.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Tiax had the innate ability to summon ghasts .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 1360s DR, Tiax was proselytizing in the streets of Baldur's Gate . By Uktar of the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , he was imprisoned by the Flaming Fist within the dungeons beneath their headquarters in the city.</p>
<p>Some time later Tiax took a job with several other adventurers tasked with escorting a bride-in-waiting and her rather large dowry, to the home of her groom in Amn . With him were the noble paladin Ajantis , the warrior Shar-Teel Dosan , the ranger Kivan , and Eldoth Kron . Unfortunately it appeared that during a fight with hobgoblins Tiax was utterly destroyed by some magical blast.</p>
<p>He got better, though, and traveled south to Amn , where he was subsequently captured by the Cowled Wizards in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR . He was imprisoned within the island asylum of Spellhold for being a "deviant" spellcaster. When the Hero of Baldur's Gate arrived in Spellhold, Tiax and the other inmates were released in order to help attack the more powerful Irenicus . Tiax was killed in the ensuing spell -battle, his dying words stating that his death was but a minor inconvenience to his plans for ruling all.</p>
