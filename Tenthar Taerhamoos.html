<h2>History</h2>
<p>At the start of the Chaos of the Art in spring of the Year of the Awakening Wyrm, 767 DR , Tenthar Taerhamoos barricaded himself in Phoenix Tower, and had his golems dig trenches right until they decayed into nothing.</p>
<p>About two tendays later, Tenthar Taerhamoos sought out the counsel of Kadeln Parosper in the House of the Ladystar , which had its gates closed, as a mob had formed just outside. Unable to cross the gates with his spells, he learned only that the priests of Mystra knew no more than he did about the Art, and was attacked by the mob; he retaliated with chain lightning before teleporting away. Back at his home, he teleported to the forest near Starmantle after learning someone had used a portal near Tangletrees to go there, suspecting the elves were on the move. He brought with himself a wedge of cheese .</p>
<p>At the woods near Starmantle, in what was then the Dead Place , he ambushed a number of Sharran Dreadspells who were distracted fighting the elven wizard Starsunder , and Tenthar's rival of many years, Umbregard of Galadorna. His deadly spell appeared to cause some feedback, causing the death of Dread Sister Avroana all the way back in the House of Holy Night . They later shared a drink with Elminster Aumar, a Chosen of Mystra , who came to heal them on Mystra 's behalf.</p>
