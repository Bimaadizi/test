<p>Iticala trees were a species of tall sap-producing deciduous trees found growing in the jungles of the Malatran Plateau .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Iticala trees were tall trees with thick and thorny trunks. The trunks rise high towards the sky, with branches and leaves growing halfway up the trunks and all the way to the top. The branches spread out evenly and stretched parallel to the ground, lush with numerous large red-veined leaves. The tree was known for producing iticala sap at the joints where the branches emerged from the trunk.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>Iticala sap was a natural secretion of the iticala trees. It was a thick and oily viscous substance with a strong scent. The sap was harmless and served as a food source for tiny flies as well as large leaf spiders . The sap left grease on the fingers of those who touched it and could serve as a high-quality lantern oil .</p>
<p>Saru — ape -like humanoids of the Living Jungle —knew of the sap's flammable properties and used it to devastate the breeding grounds of luroki , a disease-spreading insect.</p>
<p>Iticala sap could also be used to create healing iticala curing jelly .</p>
