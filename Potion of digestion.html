<p>A potion of digestion was a variety of potion that greatly expanded an imbiber's consumptive capabilities.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Those who imbibed this potion were granted not only the ability to digest any organic substance, all without suffering any deleterious effects, but all such substances became immediately appetizing to their palette. However, the potion did not enhance any part of the consumptive process beyond digestion - if an individual wanted to eat a plank of wood for example, they would have to manually break it down into consumable pieces. The duration of a ‘’potion of digestion's effects could lasted anywhere from one to four days.</p>
