<p>When petitioned by a joint delegation of Gulthmere druids and Xorhunian elves to cease Turmish's logging operations, Githsberry made a show of inviting all his lords to discuss the issue. This gathering was merely a political facade, however, as Githberry had no intention of heeding the druids' request.</p>
