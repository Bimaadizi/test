<p>Wedonai was a Chultan of the Tabaxi tribe in the late 14 th century DR who died while on an expedition in the Shining Sea .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , sometime around the month of Flamerule , a group of eccentric entertainers, entrepreneurs, and scientists embarked upon a colonizing expedition to an island they discovered in the Shining Sea off the coast of Chult , which they dubbed the " Forgotten Island ". Led by a charismatic Waukeenar priest named Devlin , they sought to create a tourist attraction on the isle that would attract wealthy people from all across the Realms. Three months later, things began to go awry for the expedition. On Marpenoth 5 , Wedonai and a strong fighter by the name of Argus were patrolling the island when they came across the horrifically mutilated corpse of a stegosaurus . Wedonai would go on to express concerns about angered forest spirits , whilst Angus would tell Devlin that the creature's wounds suggested an attack from another dinosaur .</p>
<p>On Marpenoth 11 , five velociraptors attacked the expedition site's messhall and both men aided in fending them off, though Argus would die in the process. The next day Wedonai left with the half-elf scout Jarkus and the mage Briella Farthing to check on the Sacred Heart of the Beast , an ancient Sunite relic the expedition had brought with them that was supposed to have tamed and made docile all of the animals on the island. By Marpenoth 15 , they reached the summit of the volcano where the relic had been set up, encountering the hierophant druid Baerwald , who engaged them in a conversation about how their group was threatening the balance of nature on the island and should depart. The discussion went on to take a violent turn and both Jarkus and Wedonai tried to attack the druid, but were ultimately immobilized and left trapped within a cavern beneath the island that was home to a colony of olive slimes .</p>
<p>Sometime between then and Marpenoth 23 , the two men died from the olive slimes and metamorphosed into slime creatures . Their prone bodies were later discovered by a group of adventurers hired by Briella's father Maskin . The two bodies sprung to life as the adventurers got close to them and had to be fought off, finally ending their existence.</p>
