<p>County Valashar , or Lathmarch , was known as the " Gate to the Highlands " of Tethyr . Located roughly in the southern reaches of the historic kingdom of the same name , Valashar had a large population of monsters.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Valashar was one of the Golden Marches . Being the northeasternmost area of Tethyr, it bordered the kingdom of Amn in the north and the Snowflake Mountains in the east. The Shining Stream marked its southeastern border. Its sister counties of Hazamarch and Morninggold were to the south, and County Spellshire was to the west.</p>
<p>The county rose high above sea level, over 2,000 feet (600 meteres), and was at the highest elevation of any other region of Tethyr. The Tethir Road passed through its lands.</p>
