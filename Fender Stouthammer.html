<p>Fender Stouthammer is a young dwarf of the Stouthammer clan. He was among those that followed Torgar when he left Mirabar for Mithral Hall. He was captured by Tos'un Armgo in a sneak attack with a poisoned blade. He managed to warn refugees from Nesm√© of an ambush before being skewered by a sharpened branch. He is later healed by a Cleric of Lolth, Kaer'lic Suun Wett . Tos'un and Kaer'lic present him to Obould Many-Arrows as a gift. He returns home in the company of Drizzt Do'Urden .</p>
