<p>Bloodrose bushes were a decorative plant from Teziir .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The bloodrose was a darker rose bush with blood-red flowers.</p>
<h2>Cultivation</h2>
<p>These roses were at first only known to have been grown by a conclave of clerics near Teziir , then gifted to the Lord of Suzail . In the Year of the Wailing Winds, 1000 DR , they started growing in the wild in the Battle of Bones ; though all of the roses died that year, enough were taken to propagate the type.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Bloodroses were pricey to cultivate because of how delicate they were, but that made them all the more valuable.</p>
