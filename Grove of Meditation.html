<p>The Grove of Meditation was a large stand of magnificent pine trees located in the southwestern area of Synnoria in the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>It was a great boon to elves who practiced magic . Elven magic-users with a high degree of intelligence were the only ones who could benefit from the grove. When an elven mage or fighter -mage meditated in the grove, they were able to advance their abilities further than they would otherwise. However, that elf would have to meditate in the Grove of Meditation for up to six months, morning until evening, every day. After this, the goddess granted them enough insight to advance themselves. The grove was a reusable resource; an elf could use the grove for as long as they still had something to learn.</p>
