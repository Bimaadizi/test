<p>The Nightstar was the selu'kiira of Saelethil Dlardrageth in which the old secrets of Aryvandaar were recorded.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Nightstar was a dagger-shaped deep purple crystal about 3 in (0.08 m) in length with pale glyphs. It contained more than seventy spells.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the destruction of House Dlardrageth by the Coronal of Arcorar , Ithraides discovered the selu'kiira and concealed it, but created three telkiira that would lead to its location. Any wielder of the Nightstar selu'kiira not of House Dlardrageth would be possessed into carrying it to a member of the house. Araevin Teshurr recovered the Nightstar from the vault of Ithraides beneath a white tower in the Elven Court area of the forest of Cormanthor .</p>
