<p>Malsheem , also known as the Citadel of Hell , was an infernal fortress-city found in Nessus the deepest layer of the Nine Hells . It was the home of Asmodeus ― the Faerûnian god of indulgence and lord of the Nine Hells ―along with his army of infernal guardians.</p>
<p>Asmodeus' city was not accessible by teleportation and could not be viewed by scrying , unless the archdevil allowed as such. The only known portal that led into Malsheem was found deep within Cania , which was guarded by 9,999 gelugons at all times.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The citadel of Malsheem was beyond impressive in design and scope, a design that originated from Asmodeus himself. The fortress constructed from Baatorian green steel , and its inner halls were built from gold -veined marble bathed in ever-present golden light. Malsheem was the largest stronghold in all the Outer Planes , and considered among the mightiest in all of cosmology .</p>
<p>The city was constructed in the form of a colossal stalagmite, many miles wide and just as far tall, with a cross-shaped base that extended for miles along the depths of Nessus. A nearly infinite number of tunnels and passageways extended outward from Malsheem into the surrounding landscape, adjoining infernal garrisons and barracks for Asmodeus' army of devils .</p>
<p>An oppressive aura of dread permeated the entirety of Malsheem. While it was large enough to house millions upon millions of devils, some areas of the city were entirely uninhabited. These desolate halls held no notable landmarks, and were eerily silent. Even when no sounds were readily apparent, the faint cries of imprisoned souls could be heard as if in whisper.</p>
<h3>Function</h3>
<p>The city of Malsheem served as a meeting place for the Dark Eight , the generals that commanded the forces of the Hells in the Blood War .</p>
<p>Malsheem also served a second function as a repository for certain souls that had Asmodeus deemed noteworthy enough to hide away from others.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The city-spire of Malsheem was situated within a seemingly bottomless crevasse that split open the center of Nessus, where the Hell's Lips gorge gave way to Reaper's Canyon .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>It was rumored that Malsheem was to be the site of an infernal ritual known as the Bringing . During this rite, night hags would provide millions of soul larvae to the Dark Eight, which would subsequently be outright destroyed in one swoop. It was said this would grant the generals the ultimate power to destroy the tanar'ri once and for all.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The city was home to the thousands of devils that composed Asmodeus' army. Notable among these infernal shock troops was the legion of 1,001 brazen devils , armored guardians that sought no personal glory and only existed to serve the Lord of the Nine.</p>
<p>It was said that the iteration of Asmodeus encountered in Malsheem was merely his avatar , and the true Lord of the Nine dwelled deeper within Nessus.</p>
