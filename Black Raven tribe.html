<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1340 DR , the barbarians of the north were targeted for Tyranthraxus , The Flamed One, to be taken over or used as allies for his army. The Chief of the Black Raven Tribe allied with the Flamed One after he was promised to be put in charge of all the barbarian tribes under Tyranthraxus's rulership.</p>
<p>During Lord Nasher's younger days, before he assumed the throne of Neverwinter in 1329 DR , his adventuring group, including Dumal Erard , Ophala Cheldarstorn , and Kurth , rescued the Black Raven Tribe from an evil white dragon .</p>
