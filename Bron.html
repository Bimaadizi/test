<p>Bron was a human fighter and paladin of Eldath and the Lord of Iriaebor in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He believed strongly in the city, feeling that if the in-fighting of his time were to stop, they could become a much greater power in the Western Heartlands .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Year of the Wyvern, 1363 DR , when Ravendas took over Iriaebor, Lord Bron was sent to the dungeons. After the Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon defeated Ravendas and the Shadowking , Lord Bron was found in the dungeons, but one of the members of the Fellowship, Tyveris , had become a well-known hero in Iriaebor by leading the charge in freeing the prisoners underneath the High Tower of Iriaebor , so there was a disagreement on who should be the next lord, even though Tyveris didn't want that job. Bron proposed Tyveris take up a position as his advisor instead, helping him reestablish the city, so he agreed. Everybody in the city was thereby made happy.</p>
