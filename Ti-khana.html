<p>A ti-khana was a magical mutation of deinonychus , carnivorous species of dinosaur .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The ti-khana was a unique creation born from yuan-ti experiments and hybridization, representing a modified version of the deinonychus dinosaur. These beings had a similar appearance to their forebears: reptilian creatures that move bipedally. Their physiques were somewhat more elongated compared to a deinonychus, stretching to approximately 14 feet (4.3 meters) in length. They had a height of about 8 feet (2.4 meters) and a weight nearing 900 pounds (410 kilograms). Their skin was protected by robust, vividly colored scales, and they featured a pair of prominent fangs that protruded amidst their array of sharp teeth.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>A ti-khana attacked its prey with a leap similar to that of a deinonychus, using its rear claws to deliver a powerful rake attack. It employed its forearms for grasping and its formidable jaws for biting, enhancing the already formidable attack strategy of a deinonychus with the addition of a potent toxic venom.</p>
<h2>Abilites</h2>
<p>A ti-khana was able to use detect poison at will. The ti-khana possessed the ability to transform into a viper , ranging in size from small to large. This transformation capability was akin to the effects of a shapechange spell. In this transformed state, the ti-khana could utilize either its own poison or that of the viper form it has assumed, opting for whichever was more potent.</p>
<p>The ti-khana had the ability to generate a compulsion effect that targeted a single creature within a range of 30 feet (9.1 meters). This resulted in the creature developing an aversion to snakes that lasted for ten. minutes. This aversion compelled the affected individual to maintain a distance of at least 20 feet (6.1 meters) from any snakes, yuan-ti, or ti-khanas, whether they were alive or deceased.</p>
