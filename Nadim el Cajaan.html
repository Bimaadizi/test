<p>Ynamalik Nadim yn Rahimat el Cajaan was a sorcerer -prince of the Cajaan Dynasty of the Third Age of Calimshan , who survived his family's fall.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Third Age of Calimshan , there was steady trade in rubies between the Netherese city of Tzindylspar and Calimshan, by means of a portal . However, Calimshan fell to the beholders of the Alimir Hive in −1428 DR , with the death of Nadim's relative Syl-Pasha Violir IX .</p>
<p>Power-hungry Nadim sought a means of overthrowing the beholders who now enslaved his people, and he devised a plan. He strongly suspected that the ruby vein of Tzindylspar surrounded an earth node with a link to the Elemental Plane of Earth . The next year , hoping to use the node as a means to summon an army of elementals , he and a several other survivors from his family first gathered a small army of monsters and traveled through the portal . They caught the Netherese off-guard and conquered Tzindylspar in less than a tenday .</p>
<p>Nadim and his followers transformed the earth node into a dao shrine, but he died of heartstop before he could perform the magic to open a portal to the Plane of Earth. Because Nadim had sealed the portal back to Calimshan, he followers—none of whom possessed his magical talent—could return home.</p>
