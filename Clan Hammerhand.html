<p>Clan Hammerhand was a shield dwarf clan of both Ravens Bluff in the Vast , and of Earthfast in the Earthfast Mountains in north Faerûn and the Earthroot region of the Underdark .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Hammerhands were a clan with a long history, being well established in Earthfast of old and in Sarbreen before it fell in the Year of the Bloody Crown, 649 DR . Though they eventually moved out of Earthfast, they remained in Ravens Bluff, the human city built over the ruins of Sarbreen.</p>
<p>Several members of Clan Hammerhand fought in the Horde Wars of the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , in which the dwarves of war-torn Earthfast also took part. After the war, the Hammerhands decided to resettle in their entirety in Earthfast. This necessitated warring against the local goblinoids besieging the city. Therefore, two hundred Hammerhands became mercenaries to gain experience and earn money to support their clan.</p>
<p>Arriving in the late 1360s DR, the Hammerhands were much-needed reinforcements for Earthfast. Their assistance gave the dwarves there time to fortify the defenses of Alagh Rorncaurak before 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Clan Hammerhand was led by Garren Hammerhand in the 1360s DR. It included 200 mercenaries.</p>
<p>Hammerhand mercenaries cost 5 gp per person per week, or a portion thereof.</p>
<h2>Areas</h2>
<p>While in the process of resettling in Earthfast, Clan Hammerhand remained based in Ravens Bluff.</p>
<p>For their mercenary trade, they kept offices in Ravens Bluff and Tantras in the Vast, and in Telflamm in Thesk . They mainly operated in the Vast and in the Bloodstone Lands .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>To be distinctive, dwarven mercenaries of Clan Hammerhand decorated their hair and beards with beads, from plain stone to bejeweled gold .</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>Hammerhand mercenaries were all infantry soldiers, but carried a variety of different weapons, usually hammers but also battleaxes and footman's picks . They were skilled at subterranean maneuvers and sieges.</p>
