<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As a werewolf, Tyver appeared as a gray wolf .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tyver served Selûne as a werewolf of the New Moon Pact, fighting against the faith's enemies around Berdusk in the Western Heartlands . In 757 DR , the High Moonmistress Brima Chintamn of Bright Lady's Tower in Chancelgaunt declared the New Moon Pact a heresy, and Tyver was among those captured and executed.</p>
<p>When Feena Archwood investigated the mystery of the New Moon Pact in 1373 DR , Tyver's spirit appeared in her dreams alongside the other members of the Pact to defend and guide her through the challenges to come. After she uncovered Velsinore 's heresy and they mutually slew each other, Feena's spirit was met by a Shard escort to the afterlife, but Tyver and the other Pact members encouraged her to return to life and join the New Moon Pact herself. With the aid of Julith Harkspur 's healing, Feena was revived and ultimately continued the legacy of the Pact.</p>
