<p>Khirad , also known as the Star of Secrets , was a star-like Elder Evil from the Far Realm who had taken a place among stars of Realmspace . Unlike normal stars, Khirad didn't have a fixed place in the sky but instead danced and wavered across Realmspace.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Khirad was a blue star.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Khirad, like the other Far Realm-infested stars of Realmspace, was somehow related to the Eldest .</p>
<p>Wherever an apocalypse of some sort happened in Realmspace, Khirad was the most brilliant star in the sky. Sometimes, Khirad's radiance revealed secrets and gruesome insights.</p>
<p>Khirad was one of the stars the warlock Japheth Donard sought out in 1396 DR , after having lost his pact with the archfey Neifion .</p>
<p>Sometime in the late 15 th century DR , a vestige of Khirad's power had found its way into the domain of Barovia in the Shadowfell , where it offered pacts with creatures who approached it. To those few Khirad bestowed the gift of divination , giving them the ability to use the scrying spell up to three times. Even non- warlocks could be granted this ability from the star. Those who were granted the gifts of Khirad had their voices turned into whispers, and their smiles seemed cruel and evil to onlookers.</p>
