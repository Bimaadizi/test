<p>Therapeutics was a book of research into divination through oneiromancy, written by Margritt Oji sometime before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>Margritt Oji's work discussed the writer and researcher's attempts to trigger hallucinations through means that included certain types of incense . However, after numerous unsuccessful attempts to trigger dreams and visions, the oneiromancer in question resorted to taking an undisclosed substance recommended by her own clients. The woman refused to reveal the name of the substance, but it was a fruitful attempt. The oneiromancer's dreams ended up being captured in a painting on a nearby canvas, as intended.</p>
<p>The image was a stance one, depicting a different world, possibly Earth or Eberron , or another similarly technologically advanced crystal sphere . The painting showed massive flying vehicles with what appeared to be some sort of windmills attached to their sides, like wings, and large wheeled locomotives that moved along the rails, with a single humanoid automaton waiving at the painting's observers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A copy of Therapeutics ended up in the House of Healing in the town of Reithwin , deposited there before the settlement was consumed by the shadow-cursed Lands sometime before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR . More copies could be found in the city of Baldur's Gate in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR .</p>
