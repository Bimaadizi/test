<p>A pouch of winds was a magical bag that, when opened, allowed its holder to summon a strong wind to the aid or detriment of sailing ships.</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>This magical item looked like an ordinary leather pouch that was full to the point of bulging with its contents.</p>
<h2>Function</h2>
<p>When a pouch of winds was opened, the user would decide if favorable or contrary winds were wanted. If the former was chosen, the current weather conditions would change a strong and steady gust blew in the direction that they chose. If the latter was selected, a wind of the same force would blow against the current direction of any ship in sight of the user. In either case, the winds would last for 2â€“24 hours, after which they would return to their original course and patterns.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>These pouches were created with use of the spell wind wall .</p>
