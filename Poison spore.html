<p>Poison spores were a substance extracted from myconid organs – pockets of poisonous gas, that evolved to be their defense mechanism in the cruel and unyielding Underdark .</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Poison spores sacks were valued by alchemists , who used them to produce noxious spore grenades . This thrown poisonous bomb-like weapon was the result of combining myconid poison spore sublimate (a sickly-sweet vapor distilled from the spores) and certain types of alchemical ashes.</p>
