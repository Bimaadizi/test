<p>Barze , known as the Fallen Kingdom of Barze as of the 15 th century DR , was an ancient kingdom in the Moonsea North .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The kingdom was located north of the Moonsea and west of what later became known as Vaasa . It sat in a fertile dale between two arms of the West Galena Mountains , and was bordered by the Vercy Wood to the west.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Barze was founded by the Netherese arcanist Barze in the Year of Rough Hands, −456 DR . The previous year (the Year of Hostile Badgers, −457 DR ), he had traveled with his followers from the Negarath Enclave in Netheril , fleeing persecution. He named his new nation after himself. The small realm was renown for its war wizards .</p>
<p>The Kingdom of Barze lasted from −456 DR to −357 DR . That year, the kingdom pledged its support to an alliance with the forces of Horreb , Varm , Flindyke , Mount Akoro , and Forharn to defeat Maram of the Great Spear . This expedition was led by the Dark Three , and while it succeeded at driving back the primordial , merely 1 in 25 members of the alliance survived to return home. The kingdom of Barze fell after the sorcerer-king Barze was assassinated by "one hailed as a hero", who was suspected to have been one of the Dark Three, Bhaal .</p>
<p>Shortly after Barze's death, the kingdom was conquered by the Twisted Ones and their ruler, the general Tyranthraxus . Tyranthraxus ruled cruelly, laying waste to the land and slaying the remaining princes of Barze and the lands of Horreb and the Vane to the south, until he was imprisoned in a vial of shining water and sunk beneath Lake Longreach .</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, the story of the kingdom's founding was the subject of a chapter in a book called The Great Diaspora of Netheril .</p>
