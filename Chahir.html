<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Whilst having the formidable array of powerful abilities afforded to most vampires, Chahir also utilized numerous sorcerous powers in conjunction with these to get the jump on interlopers. Often Chahir would turn himself invisible and seep out of his coffin undetected in his gaseous form before unleashing potent lightning bolts upon his foes.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>During his many years of preying on tomb robbers, Chahir had amassed a sizable amount of silver and gold coins and even an emerald . He stored this treasure in his wife's vacant coffin. In addition, Chahir carried a number of magic items on his person, which included a wand of magic missiles , a ring of protection , a cloak of resistance , and some bracers of armor .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Chahir was married to another vampire who had been destroyed in Daggerdale some time before 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hailing from an ancient and obscure noble family, Chahir was in some way connected to the vampires that troubled Daggerdale in 796 DR . Interred with his wife, who was also a vampire, in a mausoleum within the Dordrien crypts, Chahir preyed on numerous travelers over the years. At some point, his wife was destroyed in Daggerdale and by 1372 DR Chahir instead shared his mausoleum with a pair of tomb robbers whom he had transformed into vampire spawn .</p>
