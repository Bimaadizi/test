<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tybald Dunn married to Ambere a number of years before the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR somewhere south of Icewind Dale. The cooper promised her a "bright new future" and the couple moved to the cold frontier town of Lonelywood. By 1281 DR , Tybald Dunn and Ambere had a hellion of a daughter, and the wife grew unhappy and resentful of her family for being trapped in the frozen backwater of the north. During Baldemar Thurlow 's reign as the speaker of Lonelywood, he and Tybald had a strained relationship. Tybald thought the speaker to be an opportunist who was bad at bargaining and politics, and in turn, for voicing criticism, Baldemar threatened the cooper with withholding caravan contracts. But even without being cut off, speaker Thurlow tossed only scraps, making Tybald's life a struggle. He did do some business with the locals. One of Tybald's customers was Kieran Nye , the owner and bartender of the Whistling Gallows inn for whom the cooper constructed wooden kegs.</p>
