<p>The Underwater Realm of the Wizard was a large sunken peninsula on the island of Flamsterd within the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Once a promontory that comprised nearly half of the southern side of Flamsterd, the peninsula itself had been rendered into a wasteland by magic before exploding and sinking beneath the surface of the Trackless Sea .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Underwater Realm was created in the Year of the Hooded Falcon, 1291 DR , when the wizard Flamsterd moved his tower beneath the waves so that he could pursue his magical studies in solitude. He sent away his warring apprentices and enlisted the aid of druids to help him with the preparations, but the result was the apparent explosion of his tower and of the entire peninsula. The southern half of his island was flooded as the sea rushed in, becoming the Underwater Realm, while the northern half was left bleak and barren. Flamsterd survived as planned inside his tower, which was encased in a massive bubble of air at the bottom of the sea. The submerged realm came to be seen as a place of intrigue for daring adventurers .</p>
<p>Flamsterd was thought dead for many decades before once again inviting apprentices to serve him in the midâ€“14 th century DR . While the name "Underwater Realm of the Wizard" had originally referred only to the area of Flamsterd's tower, it had come to refer to the whole underwater region by the late 15 th century DR.</p>
