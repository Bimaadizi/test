<p>A haures was a type of quasi-undead demon that were dedicated to fighting.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Haureses were massive demons with the upper body of goristro situated upon a spider-like lower body.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Haureses enjoyed fighting and would charge into the middle of enemies so as to fight more. They only "shared" combat with their allies begrudgingly, only because they could not be everywhere at once.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Haureses were capable of climbing like a spider, and jumping great distances (most often in order to get into combat). They could also shoot out short bursts of spiderweb to pull enemies closer, or unleash blasts of necrotic energy.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Haureses were without fear, and always went after the strongest melee combatants first. They fought with a pair of war picks .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Haureses were rarely seen outside of the Abyss , where they acted as leaders, frontline soldiers, and executioners, although they were sometimes sent to the Underdark as scouts. They typically kept company with other demons such as mariliths , balors , and glabrezus , and were known to lead companies of armanites and jovocs into battle.</p>
<p>Their spider-like form was seen as an afront by Lolth , and other demon lords found it amusing to send haureses to harass her forces.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The original haureses were created by Orcus from the corpses of goristros that died defending him. They were then experimented upon for centuries to perfect their form.</p>
