<p>Zitembe ( pronounced : / z ɛ ˈ t ɛ m b eɪ / zeh-TEM-bay ), known as Grandfather Zitembe , was the head priest of the temple of Savras in Port Nyanzaru during the late 1480s or early 1490s DR .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Zitembe could conduct a ritual which could grant him visions from Savras relating to questions asked by visitors to the temple. He referred to this as "consulting the guides".</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the events of the death curse in the late 15 th century DR, Zitembe was granted visions that allowed him to know that the curse stemmed from the city of Omu . At the same time, he had to contend with pressure from agents of the Zhentarim who wanted his help to scry the location of Artus Cimber and the Ring of Winter , however he refused for fear of helping such evil individuals. He also had to deal with the concerns of one of his acolytes , Inete , who was plagued by visions of the Red Wizards haunting the Aldani Basin . As he was too busy to look into her visions, he granted her permission to investigate on her own.</p>
<p>Following the end of the death curse, Zitembe was granted a vision from Savras which alerted him to the machinations of the yuan-ti abomination Kress'voon , who was plotting to recreate the death curse in Orolunga with a device called the Death of the Sun .</p>
