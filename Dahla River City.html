<p>Dahla River City was a quiet waterfront village in ancient Netheril .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The town was located east of the Shinantra Mountains and south of the Hidden Forest , at the point where the Dahla River entered the western Hidden Lake . Its closest neighbors were Trinity to the south and Hoyden to the north.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The village was first settled in 3365 NY (−494 DR) . The pioneers cleared the area south of town to plant crops and build ranches, and led quiet, isolated lives. In 3456 NY (−403 DR) , the Dahla River flooded and almost destroyed the town, leading to the construction of the nearby Whitewater Bridge in 3465 NY (−394 DR) .</p>
<p>The isolation of Dahla River City was such that their first indication that something was amiss in Netheril was a sudden phaerimm attack in 3520 NY (−339 DR) , which destroyed the village. The few survivors fled south into the new wastelands of Netheril, witnessing the aftermath of the battles between the sharn and phaerimm, with only a handful surviving to join the Netherese successor states thanks to the intervention of a group of adventurers .</p>
