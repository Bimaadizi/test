<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Leader of the Bedine</h3>
<p>In the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , Sheikh Sa'ar was approached by Yhekal , an agent of the Zhentarim that hoped to form an "alliance" between his tribe and the outlander merchant's group. The meeting was interrupted by the Qahtani sorceress Ruha and the Harpers agent Lander , who warned that the Zhentilar army slaughtered the Mtair Dhafir and Qahtan tribes. Sa'ar sided with Ruha and Lander, and had his people abandon their camps and ride off, barely avoiding a raid by the Zhents' asabi mercenaries. They traveled to the Well of the Chasm to regroup with tan allied tribe, routing the Zhent camp outside the oasis, and joining the Raz'hadi in another victory at the Battle of the Chasm .</p>
<p>Following the battles, Sa'ar and Utaiba brought together fifteen other sheikhs of the Bedine tribes to the sacred Elah'zad oasis to confer on what was to be done with the Zhentarim threat. They ultimately decided to fight as one united people, gathering all the Bedine within over a tenday 's ride away from the oasis. Under the united leadership, the Bedine went on to claim victory against the asabis at the Battle of the Fissures , and finally turn away the Zhentarim from the Sword during the siege of Orofin .</p>
<h3>Change of Life for the Mahwa</h3>
<p>Over a decade later, in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the Shadow Sea formed over the Shoal of Thirst , a result of the terraforming and weather manipulation caused by the Shadovar residents of the returned Netherese city of Thultanthar . Sa'ar and the Mahwa saw this new source of water as a blessing and they regularly camped upon its shore. In short time they forewent their nomadic ways and accepted the new leisurely lifestyle presented to them.</p>
<p>That same year Sa'ar reunited with Ruha for the first time since their shared victory over the Zhentarim. Ruha had been discreetly traveling across Anauroch with her new allies Caladnei and Hhormun of Cormyr, in search of Thultanthar's resting place. The two parties each used the others' strength to their advantage: supported by the Cormyrean mages, Sa'ar stole a herd of the Shadovar's flying veserab mounts, and the Cormyreans used the Bedine's raid to draw out the location of the Shadovar's forces, leading back to their city.</p>
