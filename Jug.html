<p>A jug was a kind of liquid storage container, resembling an enormous bottle or flask . Carafes , decanters , ewers , and pitchers were similar but distinct items that focused more on pouring.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A typical jug held 1 gal (3.8 L) of liquid, such as water or milk . They were usually made from ceramic clay (sometimes earthenware ), glass , or metals, formed with a narrow neck and given a stopper to seal it shut. Some jugs had spouts or lips designed to effect accurate pouring, and a handle to make them easier to carry.</p>
<p>Pitchers were usually open-topped and designed specifically for pouring, with a molded spout and sturdy handle. Decanters resembled large, decorative bottles, intended for pouring fine drinks such as wine or sparkling water . They would have a handle to ensure that body heat from holding it did not warm the beverage within.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
