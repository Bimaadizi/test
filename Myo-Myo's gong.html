<p>Myo-Myo's gong was an enchanted gong and a shield that once belonged to a famed ghost hunter Myo-Myo from Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When used as a shield, Myo-Myo's gong offered enchanted +2 defenses to the wielder. Once per day, the shield's wielder could trike the gong, unleashing a wave of spiritual energy that burned demons, ghosts, and all sorts of evil spirits. This magic was similar to the effects of the holy smite spell .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This gong was inscribed with geometric patterns and imbued with divine magics by the titular seven stone monks of the Seven Stone Monks Temple in T'u Lung for the famous ghost hunter Myo-Myo. As of the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , Myo-Myo's gong was in the hands of a conniving drow merchant, Nym , who traveled the North and sold his magical curios. The drow was still in possession of the gong during his visit to the Wandering Village , east of the town of Kuldahar in 1312 DR .</p>
