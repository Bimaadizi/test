<p>It consisted of nine separate groups, each with only four or five members. They kept a number of small enclaves in unexplored locations throughout the Upperdark level of the Underdark. From these places, they gave aid to those who came to them and spread their dogma of enduring suffering to the denizens of the subterranean world.</p>
