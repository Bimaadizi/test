<h2>Possessions</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kana was a somewhat renowned warrior who served the Crossroad Keep some years before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , assigned to it by Lord Nasher Alagondar . She took over the seneschal's position after the fortress's commander, the Kalach-Cha , left the Crossroad Keep. She left the position in pursuit of the Way of Swords , spending some time away, learning the warrior's life path, and seeking perfection with a single weapon—her trusted katana. In the 1374 DR , Kana returned to northwest Faerûn and eagerly honed her skills sparring with traveling adventures in the vicinity of the Crossroad Keep. She did not pursue an adventurer's life and refused companionship, insisting that the Way had to be traveled in solitude.</p>
