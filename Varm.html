<p>The Varm were a tribe of nomads who dwelt in the Ride in the Moonsea North . They were one of several independent tribes known as the Horse Nomads of the Golden Steppes .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Varm were a contemplative and peaceful tribe, preferring to avoid conflict and seek peace with their neighbors. They venerated primal spirits , practiced totem magic , and aligned themselves with the land and with natural balance.</p>
<p>They ranged the Ride as horse -riding nomads, and their primary domain was located about a tenday 's ride south of the Tortured Land . It was said that, although they shunned the Tortured Land as a place of evil , for generations they made a pilgrimage into it each Ches to venerate the spirit of a glowing spring.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>While the Varm were a peaceful people, they were not immune to the inter-tribal feuding of the Ride. In particular, they were aligned against the warlike Vaegould tribe.</p>
<p>In times of great peril and mutual threat, they were known to ally themselves with the armies or adventurers of settled lands to defeat a common foe.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to Varm oral tradition, they traced their lineage directly to the ancient human culture that founded the Citadel of the Raven during the First Flowering . Scholars believed that they could also trace their ancestry to include the Rengarth tribes of Netheril .</p>
<p>Some of their tribal practices were documented in The History of the North , although the accuracy of its portrayal was questionable.</p>
<p>In the Year of Sycophants, −357 DR , the Varn aligned themselves with armies from Horreb , Flindyke , Mount Akoro , Barze and Forharn to defeat Maram of the Great Spear . This alliance was led by the Dark Three and, although it succeeded in driving back the primordial , the forces suffered devastating casualties. The memory of this event lived on in fables until the late 15 th century DR , and the tribe's shamans passed down a Horreb ritual cube whose magic was meant to be awakened if ever Maram returned.</p>
<p>In the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR , the Varm's shaman—who was also their chieftain —feared that Maram's return was at hand, and so she sought out adventurers who might be able to decipher and make use of the Horreb ritual cube .</p>
