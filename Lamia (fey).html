<p>Lamias were a type of shapechanging fey that appeared in the Realms in the period between the Spellplague and Second Sundering .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In their true form, lamias were swarms of black scarab beetles with a collective consciousness, though some exhibited other types of swarms, such as spiders . These swarms molded themselves around the bones of powerful fey creatures to form a coherent shape, then used their powers to disguise themselves as an attractive humanoid . They could take on the form of any race or gender, though typically took on the form of either eladrins , drow , or humans .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Though made up of a swarm, lamias were highly intelligent collective consciousnesses that possessed some of the memories and knowledge of their first victim. Some were driven by a need to consume other sentient beings, whilst others craved knowledge and would go to any length to acquire magical power and arcane lore.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>In addition to being able to change their shape at will, lamias could stun other creatures or drain life-force by touching them.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Every time a lamia slayed a humanoid, another beetle or equivalent creature manifested in their swarm. Eventually a lamia's swarm would grow too large and they would be forced to reproduce. This was done by slaying a powerful fey creature, then dividing itself between its current body and the new corpse. The filled corpse was gradually eaten from the inside out and then arose as a new lamia, retaining some of the victim's memories and knowledge.</p>
<p>Lamias often enslaved other, weaker creatures to act as their bodyguards and minions.</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>Lamias generally spoke both Common and the Elven language .</p>
