<p>Razorvine , often called "the kudzu of the Outer Planes ", was a creeping and climbing weed native to the Lower planes that was common in Sigil and other locations across the multiverse . Its fast rate of growth and the razor-sharp stems and thorns that gave the plant its name granted it the reputation of an environmental hazard.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Its small, serrated, heart-shaped leaves were so dark that were often considered black, usually growing on short sprigs near the plant's triangular stem. The leaves themselves were harmless, but the stems had elevated ridges that ran along the edges that were extremely hard and sharp.</p>
<p>The plant itself was not intelligent or aggressive, and could not move. The danger of the razorvine was in trying to handle it, brushing past it, or falling into it. The deep cuts caused by the stems could easily kill an unprotected creature who fell into a patch just by struggling to get free. Remaining motionless could prevent some of the damage. Armor and magic items such as a ring of protection or a cloak of protection provided some defense from the razorvine, but spells and items that misdirected an attacker, such as blur , bracers of defense , or boots of striding and springing did not help at all.</p>
<p>Each individual razorvine plant consisted of between two and twenty vines that grew in patches 12​ to ​20 feet (3.7​ to ​6.1 meters) long. It grew in chaotic and tangled systems, so it was impossible to tell exactly how many plants existed in a large patch. The plant grew extremely fast, at a rate of at least 1 foot per day (30 centimeters per day). Even after killing all vines, the plant grew back after just a few days, unless the central root system was destroyed.</p>
<p>Dried razorvine patches occasionally formed balls that could be blown by the wind.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Very few natural creatures were capable of eating razorvine, but the weed was known to be eaten by the voracious quills , porcupine -like creatures native to the Outer Planes . It was also greatly enjoyed by fhorges , creatures similar to boar that roamed the Outlands , Acheron , and the Nine Hells .</p>
<p>In Sigil, part of the duties of the dabus included pruning the razorvines around the city. The previous day's growth was cut, dried, and then sold as firewood.</p>
<h3>Uses</h3>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The exact origin of razorvine was unknown, but it was speculated that the plant had been first brought to Sigil from some jungle in the Abyss .</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , the Emerald Enclave sent adventurers to investigate reports of razorvine growing in the Marsh of Chelimber . The vines had infested the Island of Brutes , a large island located within the marsh.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>It was rumored that a visitor to Ribcage was killed and quartered for trying to smuggle razorvine cuttings into the city, shortly after it was cleared of a previous razorvine infestation.</p>
<p>The razor-sharp grass that grew on the plains of Cathrys was thought by some to be a lesser version of razorvine.</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>Razorvine was a favored plant of the deity Deep Duerra .</p>
