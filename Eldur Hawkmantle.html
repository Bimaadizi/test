At the dungeons, they intended consult with five sages, Orkrash , Garendor , Loagranboydar , Argrant and Wyshbryn , who had been sifting through ancient records to determine if any nobles at the time could have been inherited some secret powers of sorcery, so they might have been control the ghost. He figured that all rather quickly on his own at the slightest hint from Glathra.</p>
