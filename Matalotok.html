<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Matalotok was a large black warhammer, made of cold iron with inlays of nickel and silver . It was cold to the touch and was constantly surrounded by mist.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Matalotok was ancient, and was crafted by Thrym . At some point, it fell into the hands of the Witch Queen Iggwilv , who in turn bestowed it upon Kostchtchie . The eventual Prince of Wrath wielded Matalotok to great effect, dominating his frost giant tribe and even slaying three minor demon lords with the weapon. The warhammer would remain in Kostchtie's possession for many years, up until the archduchess Zariel took it from him sometime prior to the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR .</p>
