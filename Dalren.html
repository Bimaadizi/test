<p>Lord Dalren was a noble of Neverwinter on the Sword Coast North in the 1370s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the war against Luskan , Lord Dalren supplied Lord Nasher with troops and resources to fight the Luskan forces. It is most likely that Lord Dalren's gifts to Lord Nasher were to cover up more egregious crimes. The trade was questionable, angering Sand in particular, who felt Dalren did not deserve to live past the war.</p>
<p>Shortly before the Kalach-Cha arrived in Neverwinter, Dalren was visited by Ammon Jerro , who had "unfinished business". Jerro killed Dalren and walked away (since Dalren did not have a silver shard ), while the Neverwinter Watch locked Blacklake District to investigate this murder.</p>
