<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>The book was a manifesto of Araj Oblodra that recounted the fall of House Oblodra in the 14 th century DR, with the family estate being dragged into the Clawrift of Menzoberranzan . It was believed that all members of the Oblodra family perished, yet Araj Oblodra survived, the house's last living daughter. She lamented the drow priestesses who enjoyed throwing their consorts into the Clawrift after copulation at its edge. By her own words, Araj planned on traveling to the Clawrift's depths to find the lost home to use her family's and all the useless men's bones and gore to grow copies of the dead. She planned to use the obedient flesh as her army and as an army for the new House Oblodra. All the drow houses that would refuse to acknowledge the new House Oblodra would pay. Araj planned on using her explosive tinctures to blow the undersupports of the drow houses of Menzoberranzan, collapsing them into the Clawrift one family at a time. Araj Oblodra would be known as the Queen of her new swarm of obedient flesh.</p>
