<p>Flar , also rendered as Flarr , was a warrior and adventurer who was a leader of the Company of the Gryphon up to the late 13 th century DR . Notably, Flar was a wielder of Namarra , the Sword That Never Sleeps.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point, the Company of the Gryphon killed a goblin wielding an enchanted sword named Ghaur . Flar, the company's then leader, claimed the sword and found it was the legendary Namarra , which the goblins of the Valley of Khedrun had looted in the plundering of Mirabar during the Goblin Wars in 753Â DR .</p>
<p>Later, to pay for training in the combat arts, Flar gave Namarra to Thulmar One-Eye of Port Llast around the 1270s DR.</p>
