<h2>History</h2>
<p>The pale green ioun stone came about when the dying warrior Rigar Trueblood begged his companion, the mage Spectorial , to preserve his skill and fortitude in battle. Although reluctant, Spectorial acceded and extracted these qualities from Rigar's soul, placing them in an ioun stone so that others might benefit from them.</p>
<p>It eventually fell into the possession of Pai'Na , a half-drow druid lurking in a giant spider nest beneath Athkatla 's Graveyard District in 1368 DR .</p>
