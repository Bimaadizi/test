<p>Ravia ( pronounced : / r ɑː ˈ v i ə / rah-VEE-uh ) was a member of the Cult of the Eternal Fire in the Moonsea .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Ravia was a cruel and pernicious individual, and believed that she couldn't be stopped. She delighted in cruelly taunting others for their wasted efforts.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1491 DR , Ravia was ordered by her master to deliver a " devastation's orb " to the cult's chapter in Mulmaster . However, during a stop in Elmwood , the orb spontaneously detonated, razing the village. The only survivor was Ravia, who was kept in custody first by Mulmaster's City Watch and then by Zora Rosealine Culkin , owner of the village. Her fellows managed to free her just after Ravia recovered from her injures and she joined them. In the end, she was defeated by an adventuring party hired by Zora.</p>
