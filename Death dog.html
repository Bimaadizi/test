<p>Death dogs (or deathdogs ) were vicious and hateful two-headed dogs who had a taste for humanoid flesh and were infamous as spreaders of disease .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They were ugly hounds, resembling large wolves with black or dark gray fur and whose two mouths were filled with sharp teeth. Death dogs' double bark was loud and penetrating, seemingly supernaturally so. They stank of death, and this stench lingered wherever they had been.</p>
<p>They had the keen sense of smell common among canines, as well as sharp ears and eyes.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Death dogs had a deep burning hate for everything. They were aggressive and attacked travelers and explorers on sight. They hunted at night and favored ambushes, often focusing their ferocity on any creature in which they perceived weakness, frailty, or infirmity. They were known to take full advantage of the unsettling effect that their two heads had on most prey, and they seemed to revel in causing fear.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Death dogs preferred to attack in overwhelming numbers. They would pounce on their prey, using their two jaws independently to take out the legs of their prey before mauling it. They fought recklessly, trying to injure and infect their prey with their diseased bites. If forced to retreat, they lingered nearby and waited for their victims to succumb to their infected injuries.</p>
<p>A death dog's saliva had a potent poison that caused a rotting disease of a creature's flesh. Left unattended, it brought death in a matter of days. Death dogs were known to attack any intruders in their territory even when not hungry with the goal of infecting them with this malady, which they would then allow to take its course before returning once they were hungry.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Death dogs originated in the Shadowfell , where their bites transformed victims into corrupted undead . They occasionally found their way to the Material Plane via shadow crossings , where they were known to inhabit dry underground environments such as in the Underdark , as well as plains, deserts, and other arid lands. They were known to be found on the Plain of Standing Stones , where they could be encountered day or night. They tended to prefer to hunt at night, and their dark fur was well suited to camouflage at night or in caves.</p>
<p>Owing to the disease which they spread, death dogs were literal plagues upon the lands they inhabited, and were said to be associated with everything from death gods to legendary cursed rulers.</p>
<p>On the Shadowfell, they sometimes aligned themselves with shadar-kai . On the Material Plane, they did not maintain any lairs and instead traveled in packs of up to fifty individuals.</p>
