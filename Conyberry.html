<p>Conyberry was a small farming village on the eastern edge of Neverwinter Wood .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Conyberry consisted of around a dozen houses standing close to the eastern side of Neverwinter Wood, sheltering within the forest edge like many such villages in the area. The neighboring homesteads and farms extended east and south, separated by a small cart track leading to Triboar .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>People in Conyberry cut trees from the forest only when required. For food, they hunted in the forest's fringes, such as snaring rabbits, and grew crops. They also sought trade with any travelers who came through the area. Mostly self-sufficient, they bought linens, clothes, dishes, and cooking wares from traveling peddlers.</p>
<h2>Defense</h2>
<p>For being a community of farmers, Conyberry was well organized for defending itself. The village and surrounding farms could muster about 140 fighters , who were very skilled with bows and slings . After dark, the townsfolk kept lookout from atop their roofs, wielding scythes , swords , and crossbows . An unusual defender of Conyberry was Agatha , whom the villagers looked on almost in affection as a protector and friend.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The village was famous for the magical grove that was home to the elven banshee named Agatha.</p>
<p>Despite trolls and bandits dwelling in the hills to the south, travelers found it faster to pass them and journey through Conyberry, in any season but winter. A harsh winter, also known in the region as "wolf weather", caused hungry wolves to enter the community and raid food stores and coops.</p>
<p>Conyberry was also home for several good-enough carpenters, Martin von Mensch the bladesmith, and two brewers who fermented disgusting beers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR , the Companions of the Hall , Drizzt Do'Urden and Wulfgar the barbarian , entered the small community in order to procure Agatha's mask from the Ghost of Neverwinter Wood's lair. After being confronted by the townsfolk, who defended Agatha as their own, the heroes proceeded to take the mask from the banshee's grove without harming her.</p>
<p>During the Spellplague , parts of Conyberry were exchanged with parts of the equivalent region on Abeir , destroying most of the town and the surrounding lands. Survivors from Conyberry allowed the few Abeirans who survived the travel from their world to Toril to live with them, and for a time the new mixed community thrived.</p>
<p>However, members of the Uthgardt Gray Wolf Tribe , out of fear of the Spellplague, saw the Abeirans as "evil invaders" and the folk of Conyberry as their "supporters", and a few decades after the Spellplague attacked the town as a retribution for the "Abeiran invasion", forcing the survivors of the attack to join their tribe.</p>
<p>While the Gray Wolfs maintained their alliance with the Netherese , Conyberry was used by the Gray Wolfs as a place to store supplies and as a training grounds, but after the Netherese were destroyed, the barbarians abandoned the town and left it laying in ruins.</p>
