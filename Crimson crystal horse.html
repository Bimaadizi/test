<p>Crimson crystal horses were a unique variety of golems created to celebrate the Protector's Jubilee , an anniversary celebration of the city's rebirth, hosted in the late 15 th century DR in Neverwinter , the Jewel of the North.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Crimson crystal horses were, as it was evident from the name, carved of red crystal . They emitted magical sounds that vaguely resembled the sounds of a real steed channeled through a tunnel of crystalline materials. The surface of these golems was smooth to the touch and reflected light magestically as if made out of blood-filled gemstones .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>These constructs were crafted purely for ceremonial use. However, they also had some limited use in battle. Their body could be shattered in battle, dealing devastating damage to the owner's enemies, and, when a crimson crystal golem was near, its owner received a boon of increased accuracy and increased chance of dodging attacks.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Crimson crystal horses' creation took place at the very end of the late 15 th century DR. By the order of Lord Neverember , Protector's Jubilee Parade and Festival goers were given an opportunity to purchase crimson crystal items and constructs.</p>
