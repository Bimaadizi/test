<p>Griffon Hall was a grand military hall, located on Griffon Trail in the Swordspoint neighborhood of Ravens Bluff , that served as the home to the Knights of the Griffon .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most striking in all of Swordspoint, this four-story hall featured magnificent architecture and decoration, featuring glorious statues of griffons along its parapets and main entrance. The front doors were enchanted with a blade barrier spell that would trigger in the case of an open attack.</p>
<p>The roof of the hall was flat, allowing for the knights to take off and land when mounted atop their griffon steeds. These magical beasts were stabled in the tree-walled, makeshift-roost that was situated near the landing. Hitching rails and water troughs were readily available for convenient care and tacking.</p>
