<p>Upon an utterance of its command word , a wand of grease unleashed a single spell stored within. Each wand held a number of charges and disintegrated upon the use of its last spell.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>One notable creator of wands of grease was the enchantress Elytharra Dinnesmore of Neverwinter who took residence in the town of Targos sometime before the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR . She started enchanting wands of grease to slow and frustrate any creatures and savage species of the North that occasionally attacked the Ten Towns .</p>
