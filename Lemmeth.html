<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lemmeth was a part of Eskrel Starbridge's forces when seeking Elminster in Shadowdale in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR . During the search, Lemmeth managed to hold Thal , a doppelganger and accomplice of another doppelganger pretending to be Elminster, for questioning. The same force found Storm Silverhand masquerading as Elminster Aumar; fearing another doppelganger, he employed a moonglow to suss her out. After proving she was not a shapeshifter, Lemmeth left the talking to Eskrel, who was outplayed completely by Storm.</p>
<p>He was later somewhat suspicious of Eskrel because of this.</p>
