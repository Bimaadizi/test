<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first Foundation was the weapon wielded by the High Inquisitor of Auril long before the late 14 th century DR. She was a coldblooded and cruel woman who felt pleasure when she cracked the skulls of her enemies. At first, the satisfied this profane fetish my using an enchanted mace but as her desire grew, so did her need for a stronger weapon. When the Inquisitor got her hands on the Foundation she led her followers to attack a tribe of ogres who refused to join her Aurilite army. The Foundation killed many ogres but it disappeared alongside its mistress when the High Inquisitor followed an oni mage into the cave system that the ogres called home.</p>
<p>More common versions of the Foundation with a simpler +1 enchantment were forged by Master Blacksmith Marrok of Shining Knight Arms and Armor shop of Neverwinter to help the heroes who sought the cure from the dreaded Wailing Death of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Later the same year, more powerful versions were created by Master Blacksmith Barun of Beorunna's Well to help the forces of Neverwinter stand against Lady Aribeth the Betrayer , who led a marching army of Luskan in the deadly but short-lived Neverwinter-Luskan war.</p>
