<h2>History</h2>
<p>These giant spiders were bigger, stronger, dramatically faster, and smarter than their kin that did not have the taint of the lower planes . Their powerful venom caused delirium, and fiendish blood made them unaffected by mundane and magical fire. The Demons of the Samarlogh were known among the inhabitants of the jungles and settlements nearby for their malice and relentless hunger. As of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the Demons terrorized the intelligent creatures of Samarach .</p>
