<h2>History</h2>
<p>These weapons were crafted by the dwarves of Clan Hillsafar in the depths of the Galena Mountains. They were crafted in a variety of designs and possessed different magical powers. The first dwarven bloodstone blades were forged as gifts to a band of dwarven adventurers who helmed a campaign against the "Thunkers," a band of giant bandits. These eccentric adventurers named themselves "Anti-Thunkers" after securing Clan Hillsafar's mining business from the giant menace. In the 1370s DR , the Anti-Thunkers moved on from the land of Damara, and copies of their bloodstone blades began appearing in other regions of the Realms. In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , dwarven bloodstone blades were sold in Westgate , among countless unique and rare weapons and armor on the city's Market Triangle .</p>
