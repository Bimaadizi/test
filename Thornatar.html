<p>Thornatar was a War Wizard of Cormyr in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the aftermath of the massacre during the Council of the Dragon in late Mirtul of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Thornatar reported to Glathra Barcantle on the status of the castle. Per his report, wounded nobles had been returned to their lodgings with an active listening spell on them. Of the spells, three had been abruptly broken, he believed, by hired mages, while the rest had not revealed anything of note.</p>
<p>Glathra Barcantle told him to continue listening, especially for Lords Emmarask and Halvaeron . Shortly after his report, the Marchioness Immerdusk , Storm Silverhand , arrived accompanied by the mask dancer Amarune Whitewave and demanded to speak to King Foril Obarskyr I , who was in seclusion after the attempt on his life.</p>
