<p>Surrell was one of the richest mind flayers on Glyth and a leading breeder of humanoids for illithid consumption.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Surrell was the owner of the 12 Skulls Ranch , a humanoid breeding ranch with a herd of over 12,000 oortlings located in one of the few surviving forests on the surface of Glyth.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>On his ranch, Surrell conducted experiments with selective humanoid breeding. He worked tirelessly, underground by day and on the surface by night, fine-tuning the oortling race so their brains tasted better for mind flayers. The products of his work made him famous across Realmspace and even known in Greyspace . His herds were sold at a high price to other mind flayers, but were considered a delicacy.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Surrell's success drew the envy of other breeders from the planet.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Selective breeding of oortlings by mind flayers using techniques such as the ones performed by Surrell was one of the causes of the decline of the oortling race. Although a few oortling colonies still existed that remained untouched by mind flayers, the ones who were captured had their curiosity and creativity bred out of them, leaving behind a broken race of docile, frightened, and cattle-like people.</p>
