<p>Aphril was a seer and an inmate of the Spellhold asylum in 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wizard was kept in Spellhold, the Residence for the Magically Deviant, for her sage-like abilities. Experimenting with planar travel gave her awareness of sights beyond the known world. Aphril was driven mad by her ability to stare through and across the planes , as well as at their denizens.</p>
<p>She did not sleep much, and would apparently be studied so that some good may come of her condition. Her eyes did "not close when closed", so she was never truly alone, always surrounded by mysterious places and creatures.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR , Aphril was amongst the inmates at Spellhold when it was taken over by Jon Irenicus . When Gorion's Ward arrived seeking Imoen , despite Aphril's initial caution, she was goaded into battling the evil elven archmage to avenge the torments she had suffered under his hands. Unfortunately, like the rest of the inmates, she evidently perished.</p>
