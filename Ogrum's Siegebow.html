<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ogrum's Siegebow was a mystery, and its origins were unknown. The first time the weapon appeared was in the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR , when Slogg Ogrum singlehandedly besieged the town of Priapurl in the Eastern Heartlands . When the orc was defeated with the help of the Mindgulph Mercenary Company , Ogrum's vast arsenal of weapons was uncovered, however, no one really uncovered the reasons for the orc's siege of the town.</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Ogrum's Siegebow was sold in Westgate , among countless unique and rare weapons and armor on the city's Market Triangle .</p>
