<p>Halfling Downs was a particularly fertile stretch of land found in the Duchy of Carmathan in Damara .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Halfling Downs was situated amidst rolling hills in the southeast corner of the duchy along the borders of Impiltur and the Barony of Ostel . It was nestled between Ravensburg and Zarach .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>For its size, Halfling Downs was one of the most productive farmlands throughout the Bloodstone Lands as of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , and boasted the largest crop yields per farmer in all of Damara.</p>
<p>The halflings of the region tolerated visitors but preferred to be left to themselves, until an incident with a rampaging bulette required the assistance of the Twilight Riders of Bloodstone . This bulette had escaped from the Circus of Doctor Trundles in 1357 DR , and terrorized the region for many months before the Riders defeated the beast without a single casualty while passing through the area in 1359 DR . Their heroics did much to warm the people of Carmathan to the idea of accepting Bloodstone’s baron, Gareth Dragonsbane , as their potential future king.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The farmland was inhabited primarily by tallfellow halflings who prided themselves on hard work and tended to keep to themselves, preferring to stay out of the drama of human politics in Damara. A small population of human farmers also called the region home.</p>
<p>A rowdy band of halfling adventurers known as the Kneebreakers hailed from the Downs.</p>
