<p>Cedarsproke , sometimes referred to as Cedarspoke , was a small, independent city in the middle of the Gulthmere Forest inhabited and ruled by druids .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cedarsproke was considered a druid fortress that an invading force had never taken, and it was the only settlement in the Gulthmere Forest.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Cedar River divided the city in two.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Gulthmere Forest was ruled by a druidic circle of thirty-three members that met in Cedarsproke. The number of members never increased, and the membership rotated seasonally. In 1372 DR , the city was governed by Zalaznar Crinios , a druid and a very popular ruler. The Grand Druid was the leader's official title and every word was the law. Any visitor who had unfavorable opinions of Eldath or Silvanus was recommended to keep them to themselves.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Merchants and traders occasionally used Cedar River to transport their goods into Cedarsproke; however, most unloaded their goods in the city of Starmantle to the west and traveled from there by land. The religious significance brought a high number of pilgrims to the druid stronghold every year, and many adventurers traveled to Cedarsproke in search of ancient lore and history. The volume of visitors gave rise to several businesses that catered to guests of Cedarsproke.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Cedarsproke was established circa 200 DR by a druidic enclave dedicated to the worship of Silvanus , the Forest Father. Cedarsproke quickly became popular among the initiates eager to join the Church of Silvanus .</p>
<p>In Year of the Druid's Wrath, 717 DR , the neighboring kingdom of Turmish came to clash with the druids of Silvanus and the Emerald Enclave. The Windlass , the wizardly conclave that ruled Turmish at the time sent a part of their army to attack Cedarsproke. The troops never reached Cedarsproke as the agents of the Emerald Enclave decimated them as they moved through the Orsraun Mountains . This attack on the city led to the druids of Cedarsproke convinced the Church of Silvanus of distancing themselves from the Emerald Enclave to avoid future dangers. Following this, a powerful hierophant of the Enclave established a new base on the island of Ilighôn .</p>
<p>In 1196 DR , the holy Mielikkian spellbook , Yornar's Trail Companion , was delivered into the hands of the priest Klavaeron of Cedarsproke by the ranger Rhighaermon O'Antlers and his new wife Dathae of Essembra. The couple had traveled to the druid town while on their honeymoon.</p>
<p>By Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , the druids of Cedarsproke were engaged in a "pacifistic" war against the cult of Malar that plagued the region. Even though the druids did not take aggressive moves against them, reserving to defensive actions, the Grand Druid offered a reward to adventurers willing to stand against the cult of the Beastlord.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The residents of Cedarsproke were simple folk who sought to live off land and druids who rarely interacted with the Emerald Enclave , the major power in the Vilhon Reach. Silvanites of Cedarsproke lived in harmony with Nobanion , the Lion King of the Vilhon Reach, Dragon Coast , and Shining Plains .</p>
