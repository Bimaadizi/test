<p>Nat Wyler's Bell , or simply known as the Bell , was a cheap dive tavern and an inn located in the slums of Phlan , of the Moonsea region.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Bell stood in the heart of the slum district of Phlan. Its distance made it a popular stupor for the individuals trying to avoid the city guard or the members of the Council of Ten .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Nat Wyler's Bell was a small establishment of no particular note apart from its smell of stale ale and the second floor's common sleeping area with only three beds.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Even though a tiny building, it had several tables, often occupied due to the dive's low prices, a bar , and the kitchen. The furniture, the walls, and the door were old, showed significant wear, and scratches. The main room was often busy and cramped but was pretty quiet as most guests liked to keep to themselves.</p>
<p>The most notable thing in the Bell was Nat Wyler, its owner. By 1367 DR , Nat Wyler has been dead for around 20 years, and his body has been part of the detour. His preserved body was posed behind the bar holding the titular bell of bronze .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Nat Wyler's Bell was known for its cheap but bland food and alcohol. Many locals with not much coin in their pockets came into the Bell to fill their bellies with food, drinks and then sleep it off in the common room upstairs.</p>
<p>The sleeping arrangements were not the best in the city, and the Bell used not the most comfortable corn husk-stuffed mattresses.</p>
<p>The Bell rented its private rooms out circa 1340 DR for 12 sp a night, and the common room was priced at 8 cp per bed a night.</p>
<p>The food selection was limited, and most guests ordered cheap ales , especially doughy breads , and cheeses . The most popular item on the menu, however, was deceptively easy to drink firewine that packed a wallop. It was a common belief that the tavern mulled their own firewine in the kitchen's washtub.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1340 DR, following the tumult of the recent years, the Bell was a common meeting place for dangerous, unlawful individuals, ruffians, thugs, and swords-for-hire. The tavern was spread over a much bigger part of the building during that time. The Bell had eight private rooms and a much bigger common sleeping area that cost fit up to 20 customers.</p>
<p>Then the bar was named after its one-time owner, Nat Wyler. At some point circa 1347 DR , he was turned into a popular, but somewhat grim attraction for the clientele of the bar.</p>
<p>By 1367 DR, a sneaky but friendly gnome Gnahac Gnarlnose became the owner of the Bell, and at some point, the tavern lost ownership of a big part of the building, significantly shrinking its business.</p>
<p>In 1369 DR , Nat Wyler's Bell served as a home for a thief Kestrel for several months. She and her fellow thieving friend Ragnall could often be seen dining in the fine establishment. The Bell's infamously strong firewine was responsible for the formation of the Veiled Ones , the adventuring group who subsequently fought against the Cult of the Dragon 's sinister plot. Imbibing more firewine than expected, Kestrel, in her blackout drunk state, volunteered to stand guard over the recently resurfaced pool of radiance in Phlan . That task eventually led the sentries to travel to Myth Drannor and stopping the evil cult.</p>
