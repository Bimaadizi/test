<p>Earth gliders were natives of the Elemental Plane of Earth .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Earth gliders looked like a manta ray with a long tail with a sharp spike of bone at the tip. Its skin was rough and had a texture like stone. They lacked eyes and their large mouth was filled with sharp teeth. Earth gliders had long wings, part of which protruded on both sides of their heads, forming sharp horns.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Earth gliders had a natural immunity to fire and a resistance to electricity. They were capable of detection the presence of any creature in direct contact with the earth within 60 ft (18 m). Earth gliders moved through the earth the same way a marine animal swam in water, leaving behind no tunnel or any sign of their passing. They were unable to move through metals.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Earth gliders were hateful and sadistic.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Earth gliders were fierce and merciless fighters. Their bite delivered a potent poison, the effects of which mimicked a flesh to stone spell. In battle, they used their horns to viciously gore an opponent, and used their powerful tail to bludgeon a target.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>In addition to being carnivorous, earth gliders were also able to feed off of dirt and stone.</p>
