<p>Eldura Moreen was a great inventor and bloodforge mage in the Utter East during the time of the Bloodforge Wars ( 648 â€“ 657 DR ).</p>
<p>Eldura worked tirelessly within the Hall of Wonder to discover the essence of the bloodforge. But the leader of the Legendary Campaign resolved that no-one should know the secret of what the gods had wrought, and went there to put an end to Eldura's quest in a bloodforge battle.</p>
