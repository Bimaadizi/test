<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Celedon was excitable and mischievous but with a kind heart. He liked the thrill of a heist and would occasionally steal from evil folk just for the challenge, although he was quick to give away his spoils to those in need. He was also a bit of a procrastinator, and hesitated to make assumptions.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Celedon was known to possess a spellbook , a long sword +1 luck blade , a ring of protection +3 , potion of fire breath , a oil of etherealness , a rod of alertness , and a mirror of mental prowess . He also had scrolls containing the spells contingency , forcecage , and volley .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Celedon was the leader of the scouting network Spysong in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR. He had the task of keeping a close watch on the Grandfather of Assassins . The Grandfather in turn placed a 1000 gold piece bounty on his head.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The bard Riordan Parnell was his cousin.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Celedon, along with his cousin Rioardan, would scout throughout the Galena Mountains , and discovered locations like the Cave of the Whispering Wind . The two of them were among the strangers brought together by Gareth Dragonsbane to respond to the requests for aid coming from Bloodstone Village following the Vaasan War , and Celedon would go on to serve as both a commander and the Chief Scout in the army of Bloodstone in the Bloodstone Wars . Celedon's actions were directly responsible for the end of that war, and for the permeant defeat of Zhengyi the Witch-King , when he stole the Wand of Orcus and brought it to the Seven Heavens for destruction.</p>
<p>Following the liberation of Damara from the Witch-King in 1359 DR , Celedon was knighted for his efforts. He helped to found the intelligence network Spysong, and was considered a hero across most of Damara . Once of his first major projects was to personally investigate a mysterious cloud that had settled over Suncatcher Mountain .</p>
<p>A decade later, he participated in the battle between Gareth Dragonsbane, who at that time had become King of Damara, and Bregan D'aerthe for control of northern Vaasa .</p>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , he played a central role in saving Gareth's life during the invasion of Damara by Sammaster 's forces during that year's Rage of Dragons .</p>
