<p>Thalvan was a merfolk kingdom in Serôs , the realms beneath the Sea of Fallen Stars .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In −1399 TS (−1469 DR) , a massive horde of merrows and koalinths invaded the Hmur Plateau , igniting what would become known as the Fourth Serôs War . Their numbers too great to be overcome, they overran the Plateau and brought about the fall of the Republic of Tivaan . Feeling desperation, a mermaid stole a powerful artifact known as the Emerald Eye of Kyron from one of the towers of the Dukars of Myth Nantar , believing it could drive away the invaders. However, she became corrupted by the Emerald Eye , taken over by what some believed to be the spirit of its original owner contained within the artifact, the Mad King Kyron of Thalorlyn .</p>
<p>With her mind corrupted by the Emerald Eye , the mermaid imposed herself upon the invaders. She proclaimed them to be the Second Kingdom of Kyron and became their leader in a continued conquest of the Hmur Plateau. The war would eventually come to an end in −1396 TS (−1466 DR) , with the possessed mermaid killed and the Emerald Eye taken back into the custody of the Dukars. The mermaid's body would be buried in the Plains of Duna, subsequently renamed the Haunted Plains , and the Kingdom of Thalvan would be founded by King Darmox as the successor to the Republic of Tivaan.</p>
<p>The Aryselmalyr Empire , having over the past century subjugated the merfolk of Serôs under the reign of Coronal Essyl Merynth , promised Thalvan protection under its new leader, the kindly Coronal Vaeqiis .</p>
