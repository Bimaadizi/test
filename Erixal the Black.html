<p>Erixal the Black , the Wizard of Alaghôn , was a sage from Turmish whose works were published before 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Erixal the Black was known for his musings about the Emerald Enclave , a major organization of the Vilhon Reach , that protected nature, often by cruel and violent ways. The sage claimed that nothing was done in the Reach without the tacit approval of the Enclave. Erixal considered the druids and elves to be the biggest threat to industries and businesses of the Realms. However, the wizard himself always haltingly states that he has no problem with the organization whatsoever.</p>
