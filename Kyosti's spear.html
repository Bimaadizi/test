<p>Kyosti's spear was an enchanted hunter's spear wielded by Kyosti of the Wandering Village until his death in 1312 DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Kyosti's spear was a masterfully crafted and ensorcelled polearm , imbued with a +1 enchantment that guided its tip towards the target when wielded in melee or if thrown. The design and magics of the weapon had a chance of dealing devastating piercing damage to its target.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kyosti, along with the best artisans of the Wandering Village, deep in the cold tundra of the Frozenfar , spent many mons crafting and enchanting his weapon. The resulting polearm was a simple-looking weapon like its owner and the village. Kyosti still carried his spear when he was lured away from the village by his wife Carita and her lover Leevi . The hunter was murdered by the couple, and his spear was left in a makeshift grave along with the mutilated body in the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR .</p>
<p>Some days later, a group of mercenaries from Targos arrived to the Wandering Village, seeking passage to the remote town of Kuldahar . The village's elder Suoma offered guidance in exchange for several good deeds for the village. One of them was investigating Kyosti's disseverance and his mute ghost appearing in the wilderness. Subsequently, the adventurers discovered the truth of the grizzly murder, and the hunter's ghost gifted them with his prized spear as a reward for letting his spirit rest.</p>
