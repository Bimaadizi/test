<p>The Qahtan were a tribe of the nomadic Bedine that traveled across the Anauroch desert in the years leading up to the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Like all of the Bedine tribes, the Qahtani people were led by a male sheikh.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>They preferred to make camp at the El Ma'ra oasis, but laid claim to a stretch in the north of the desert.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The tribe enjoyed a brief friendship with the Mtair Dhafir tribe.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the summer of the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , the Qahtan were plagued by no water in their territory of the desert, on the northern sands of the Sword , and traveled south to the lands of the Mtair Dhafir. Sheikh Sabkhat of the Mtair Dhafir offered up an alliance between the two tribes: their people would share the region for the summer, after which the Qahtan return north to their home. The union between the tribes was bound by the marriage of Sa'ar's daughter Ruha to Ajaman , the son of the Qahtani sheikh.</p>
<p>That same year, the sheikh of the tribe was approached by Lord Zarud of the Zhentarim , who hoped to forge an "alliance" with the tribe. According to Zarud, the Qahtani leader chose not to enter into such an agreement.</p>
<p>Following the refusal, nearly every member of the Qahtan were slaughtered by a night time raid of Zhentarim warriors and their asabi mercenaries. The only known survivor was Ruha, the young Qahtani woman who was hiding the fact she had sorcerous powers, and Kadumi a young warrior who had been traveling on a lone camel ride across the desert as a rite of massage into manhood.</p>
