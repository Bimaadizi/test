<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Eldryn was an old human Thayan man. He was bitter and paranoid. He was afraid of being back-stabbed by his many wanna-be successors. He was said to be more prepared for an attack and betrayal than a beholder .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The Zulkir of Abjuration layered his robes with many woven defensive magics. Eldryn's specialization were automatically-triggered counterspells , many of which were unique spells developed by the bitter old man, and their secret formulae were taken to the grave with Eldryn's death.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Eldryn Lammaraster took the position of the Zullkir of Abjuration sometime before the late Year of the Starfall, 1300 DR . His name was among several zulkir names that became widely known after being named and described in the book called Twelve Winters Under the Lash , penned by an anonymous slave and smuggled out of Thay sometime in late 1300 DR.</p>
