<p>The Temple of Lliira was a place of worship dedicated to Lliira , the goddess of joy, in the Thayan city of Bezantur .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple was located in southern-central Bezantur, the so-called "City of a Thousand Temples." Appropriately, it was surrounded by other temples, notably the Temple of Talona , the Temple of Auril , the Temple of Oghma , the Temple of Sune , the Temple of Helm , and the Temple of Malar . It was also quite close to the Temple of Umberlee , Ilmater's Cathedral , and the House of Cyric .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The temple consisted of a central hall made of white marble surrounded by multicolored pavilions and tents.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The temple was a joyful place that advocated for hedonism, altruism, and individualism. This made the temple moderately popular with the decadent citizens of Bezantur, but decidedly unpopular among the Red Wizards who ruled the city.</p>
