<p>Rault , who was called the Wise , was the Northlander Jarl and later King of Norland in the Moonshae Isles during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Rault was wise and pragmatic thanks to his long decades of experience. He believed that only through cooperation and unification could the Northlanders and Ffolk of the Moonshaes survive the many dangers that they faced.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Rault ruled from Stormbanner Hold in the city of Rogarsheim . With the decline in power of House Kendrick , and the restlessness of his own Northlanders, Rault declared Norland's independence from High King Derid .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Rault's son and grandson were Olfgaut and Olfsvenn respectively. He also had a brave and wise granddaughter.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Born in the Year of Deaths Unmourned, 1394 DR , Rault grew up hearing stories from his elders about a time before the unification of the Moonshaes , and had long held an admiration for House Kendrick's achievements of peace. However, when the Storm Maiden rose to power in Norland in the late 15 th century DR, she and her followers pushed for the Northlanders of Norland to return to their warlike ways, and pressured Rault to either secede from Kendrick rule or else to be overthrown. He relented to the demands to declare independence, but as of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Rault knew it was only a matter of time before the Storm Maiden forced him to abdicate anyway. He saw the favor of destiny in the Storm Maiden and could easily see her ruling not only Norland, but the entirety of the Moonshae Isles as well at some point.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , Rault still ruled, but wars with the Storm Maiden had left him with no male heirs after both his son and grandson were slain. As the title of "jarl" had been used to denote vassal-kings of the Kendricks, Rault had taken on the title of "king of the Norls" by this time.</p>
