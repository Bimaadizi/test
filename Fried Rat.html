<p>The Fried Rat was a restaurant on Rat Alley in Luskan established by two retired shiphands who had developed a taste for rat after long periods at sea, and wanted to serve it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The restaurant burned down long before 1370 DR . Two theories existed: one was that flaming grease was responsible for the fire, and the other was that discontented wererats were to blame.</p>
