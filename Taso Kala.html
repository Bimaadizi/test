<p>Taso Kala was a drow matron who lived in Ust Natha .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1369 DR , she crushed a sect of Ghaunadaur worshipers, but fled to the south-east of Ust Natha. She may have asked Gorion's Ward and companions to perform a service for her, which was apparently demanded by Lolth . The service was to destroy the sect completely, which was led by a high priest and the mage Relonar . She would, however, give no reward, apart from allowing the adventurers' continued existence.</p>
