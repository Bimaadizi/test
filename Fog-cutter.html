<p>Fog-cutters were a type of lantern specifically designed to illuminate through fog.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The design of the fog-cutter was similar to the bullseye lantern , with the addition of an amber -colored focusing lens that illuminated foggy areas better than a regular lantern. It was inspired by lanterns used in lighthouses with a similar mechanism to illuminate through sea fog.</p>
<p>Fog-cutters were available for purchase through Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue .</p>
