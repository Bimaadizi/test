<p>Broalaunt was a Thayan cursed by Samaerra , an apprentice of Larloch , to become a boar after he became too familiar with her at a Magefair . He had to achieve a series of unbindings by performing great tasks; such as eating thirteen rabid chipmunks, and kissing the Simbul , among others. As a boar he was known as Warpig , and his companion was a half-orc named Orokh .</p>
