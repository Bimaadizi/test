<p>Kamal el Drakhon was syl-pasha of Calimport during the Third Age of Calimshan . He was famous for commissioning the formation of el Qysanallojal , the Imperial Navy of Calimshan .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the entirety of Kamal's reign, the empire was at war with the beholders of the Alimir Hive , led by Qyraaptir the Bloodeye . To help in the fight against the eye tyrants, Syl-Pasha Kamal commissioned the formation of the Imperial Navy, around the year −1150 DR . This decision was crucial in leading to the defeat of the beholders 70 years later, as it vastly sped the transportation of Calishite troops to where they were needed in the war. Furthermore, the new navy greatly increased the political and trade power of the empire with other nations.</p>
<p>Around the same time, the syl-pasha ordered the expansion of the Pasha's Sabban and the Armada Ward and restructured other areas of Calimport destroyed by the Villaflames conflagration of −1156 DR .</p>
