<p>Guild of Trusted Pewterers and Casters was one of the registered guilds of the city of Waterdeep , specializing in the casting of metal items.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>

<h2>Activities</h2>

These bars measured 1 foot (0.3 meters) in length and 3 inches (0.076 meters) in both height and width. This mixture was the basis for all castings conducted by guild members, though guildsmen always liked to add their own "secret ingredients" to their castings in order to further refine the quality of their products.</p>
<p>The Guild's its title of "trusted" referred to its common policy of discreteness. Guild members would melt down objects and re-casting them without badgering their clients with any sort of inquiries or comments.</p>
