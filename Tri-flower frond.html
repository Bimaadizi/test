<p>A tri-flower frond was an aggressive plant common to the jungles of Chult .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A fully grown tri-flower frond reached between 6 and 7 ft (1.82 to 2.13 m) tall, and sprouted three large flowers at its top: one orange, one red, and one yellow.</p>
<p>When spotted from a distance, tri-flower fronds appeared indistinguishable from ordinary plants, and were often found in small groups.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Normally, tri-flower fronds did not initiate an attack until a creature came very close to them. However, they were also known for sneaking up on camps during the night.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Tri-flower fronds attacked by sequentially using its differently colored flowers. The first attack was a powerful anesthetic poison from the orange flower that could knock a creature unconscious for at least a minute. The second was an acidic sap ejected from the yellow flower. The third attack consisted of trapping a creature in acidic tentacles sprouting from the red flower.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>These creatures were common throughout Chult and were found mainly in jungle and beach areas, as well as within ruins.</p>
