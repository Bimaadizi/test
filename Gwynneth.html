<p>Gwynneth was an island in the Moonshae Isles traditionally settled by the Ffolk , and the largest island in the archipelago. As of the late 15 th century DR , Gwynneth was called Sarifal by its fey inhabitants, who controlled most of the island by that time.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gwynneth was an island of lush nature and severe weather. Following the rise of Sarifal, it had become a breathtakingly beautiful, wild, and magical place by the late 15 th century DR.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Gwynneth lay south of the Sea of Moonshae , with Oman's Isle and Alaron to its north, Snowdown to its east, and Moray and Flamsterd to its west. It was dominated by three massive mountain chains: the Black Mountains in the north, the Cambro Mountains in the east, and the Highlands in the west. These mountains collectively formed a great and lush valley known as Myrloch Vale , which dominated much of the northern half of the island. Following the return of Sarifal to the island, this area became suffused with the magic of the Feywild .</p>
<p>Much of the western coast was dominated by tall granite cliffs or poisonous bogs with few beaches or inlets, meaning the only safe harbor on this side of the island was at the terminus of Corwell Firth where Caer Corwell sat.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>Unicorns could be spotted in the wild places of the island. After the Ffolk were driven from the island in the 15 th century DR, the pastoral southern lands where they had once settled became overrun with wild moorhounds and violent owlbears .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<h3>Corwell</h3>
<p>The south of Gwynneth had long been the domain of the Ffolk Kingdom of Corwell , ruled by the kings and queens of House Kendrick from Caer Corwell. This realm began to shrink as fey overran the island beginning in the late 14 th century DR before finally collapsing in the early 15 th century DR.</p>
<h3>Oman</h3>
<p>The northern coast of Gwynneth had fallen under the control of the Northlander Kingdom of Oman as of the mid–14 th century DR. When Oman's Isle was overrun by giants in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, the Kingdom collapsed. The Northlander settlers on Gwynneth would eventually be expelled by the fey at the same time as the Ffolk of Corwell in the early 15 th century DR.</p>
<h3>Sarifal</h3>
<p>The fey who claimed Gwynneth as their own in the 15 th century DR comprised the Kingdom of Sarifal . It was ruled by High Lady Ordalf and her son, Prince Araithe , and generally did not allow humans to set foot on the island. Although they claimed the whole of the island, their rule was resisted by giants in the Highlands , fomorians in the Underdark , unseelie fey at Citadel Umbra and Caer Corwell , and human holdouts at Borth and Kingsbay in the east.</p>
<h3>Synnoria</h3>
<p>Hidden in a secret valley was the ancient Kingdom of Synnoria , home of the Llewyrr high elves of the Moonshaes. Long ruled by the Most Serene Matriarch Ate`Niah , this realm swore allegiance to Sarifal as of the late 15 th century DR.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In ancient times, the le Shay had founded their capital city of Karador on Gwynneth before retreating into the Feywild many centuries before the arrival of the first humans. During their reign, the first of the Llewyrr elves and dwarves would settle the island.</p>
<p>Gwynneth was the site of the first human settlements on the Moonshaes when the ancestors of the Ffolk arrived in the Year of the Executioner, 140 DR . It was named for Gwynneth "the First Mother" , who had led them to the island and founded the settlement that would become Caer Corwell. After conflicts with the Llewyrr and amongst each other, the Ffolk would become the dominant inhabitants of the island until the arrival of the first Northmen raiders in the 3 rd century DR. As of the mid–14 th century DR, the entire northern coast of Gwynneth as far south as the mountains of Highhome was under the control of the Northman kingdom of Oman.</p>
<p>By the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, the Ffolk and the Northlanders had come to live together in peace, and the greatest threat to Gwynneth were Nelanther pirates along the southern coasts.</p>
<p>In the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR , the fey city of Karador rose once more from the waters of the Myrloch on the heart of Gwynneth, and the noble le Shay High Lady Ordalf proclaimed the return of the realm of Sarifal with herself as queen of the whole island. The human kingdom of Corwell subsequently fell into ruins. Humans would be all but banned from the island during the 15 th century DR.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>For most of its history, Northlanders lived on the northern part of the island and the Ffolk lived in the southern lowlands of the island. The Llewyrr elves lived in Synnoria and firbolgs lived in Myrloch Vale.</p>
<p>In the Underdark beneath the island lived drow and fomorians. The drow lived beneath Winterglen in the northeast, and practiced an unusual version of the Lolthite religion in which they honored their goddess as a multifaceted version of her ancient identity, Araushnee . The fomorians were divided into nine clans, and over generations had overseen the construction of a long highway 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) underground that followed the Cambro Mountains .</p>
