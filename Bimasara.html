<p>Bimasara was the Padhrasattva of Barter within the Padhran religion .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In statuary, Bimasara was depicted as a man with a pleasant smile, with one hand holding a sheath of barley and the other held up with palm up to receive payment.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before the city was destroyed, Kushk in Ra-Khati held a large collection of Bimasara's followers. They dwelled in the trade city's third district, where they acted as go-betweens and agents so Ra-Khatian and foreign merchants never met, and thus were viewed as "unclean". However, they skimmed a very small percentage of every sale, and so in time grew wealthy. With this money, they built their temple, called the Holy Mountain of Kus .</p>
<h2>Practices</h2>
<p>Followers of Bimasara undertook a series of tests within the bowels of Mount Kus . Only the wisest of them were able to make it to the Tower of Harmony that sat atop the mountain.</p>
