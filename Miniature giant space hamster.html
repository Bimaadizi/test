<p>Miniature giant space hamsters , sometimes called giant pygmy space hamsters or simply space hamsters , were one of the many variants of giant space hamsters that could be encountered across different worlds.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Miniature giant space hamsters were identical in size to regular hamsters .</p>
<p>These creatures were apparently quite intelligent and had the ability to talk in whispers, though most of the time they just made normal hamster squeaks. They were considerably more intelligent than regular hamsters and possessed short-range telepathic abilities, which they kept hidden from most creatures they encountered. According to advertising brochures found in Sigil, they were gentle with children.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>If they found themselves in a fight, miniature giant space hamsters had the ability to target the eyes of their opponents with a ferocious attack, which was capable of blinding them for a few seconds.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Unlike most giant space hamster variants, miniature giant space hamsters did not fill the ecological niches usually associated with large animals such as rhinos and elephants and were instead usually kept as pets. Although being native to wildspace , they could be found on many worlds of the Prime Material plane .</p>
<p>The Prime Exotics shop in Sigil sold miniature giant space hamsters for 1 gp each. Availability was limited.</p>
<p>The Infernal Rapture restaurant in the Nine Hells often served cooked miniature giant space hamsters. They had been deep fried, and seasoned with herbs and tears.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to Minsc , a miniature giant space hamster was a giant space hamster that had been miniaturized.</p>
<p>Like all giant space hamsters, they were not naturally evolving creatures, but were instead created by gnomes originally from Krynn . Gnomes experimented with giant space hamster breeding by mixing enchanted substances from a variety of monsters into the process, which produced several varieties of giant space hamster. Among those, miniature giant space hamsters were one of the more unusual varieties.</p>
<p>Other sages argued that the first miniature giant space hamsters were created as a result of wizards using magic to shrink giant space hamsters. The process was believed to have made the creatures more intelligent, as well as having granted them telepathic abilities.</p>
