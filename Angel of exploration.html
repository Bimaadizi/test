<p>Angels of exploration were a kind of astral angel that thrived in tasks requiring exploration.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Angels of exploration had porcelain-white skin, glowing, icy eyes, and wings made of magma. They carried flaming swords and wore golden armor; their bodies trailed off into misty ether below the waist.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>At least one angel of exploration was extremely loath to transport other beings across planar boundaries, to the point it considered dropping them in Avernus and going on its merry way; it only obeyed in the first place because of a pre-existing pact. However, its curiosity won out once it was told it was heading for a previously unknown location, and it accepted the task with certain enthusiasm.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Angels of exploration could use their swords to rend gashes in the Planes, which they used to transport objects across them. When involved in tasks of transportation, their strength was far beyond what their bodies could ordinarily manage.</p>
<p>They could fly, and their wings played some role in their movement.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>They used their swords to fight.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Angels of exploration were known to serve other angels as advance scouts.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The archfey Neifion bound Mapathious , an angel of exploration, in 1396Â DR to lower both him and the warlock Japheth Donard in a trek bell down to Xxiphu . Once in Xxiphu, the angel was attacked by the kraken Gethshemeth , who slew it.</p>
