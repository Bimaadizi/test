<p>Arsonist's oil was a type of magic oil that turned resistance to fire to a vulnerability.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Arsonist's oil was a white oil, usually packed in round glass containers that could be quickly opened and applied to weapons in the heat of battle or tossed at an enemy with ease.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When a weapon coated with this oil stricken a creature or an object that possessed resistance to heat, flame, and high temperatures, such as a cambion , they immediately lost the protection from that element, becoming vulnerable to fire. The effects of this oil had no effect on those who were immune to fire.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>A recipe of this elixir required a mixture of alchemical sublimate of unmelting ice mephit 's frosted ears and certain types of ashes.</p>
