<p>Susztam Mar-Shinn was a drow illusionist and shadow adept . He was the Head Student of the Inverted Tower and a user of the Shadow Weave in Szith Morcane in the mid-to-late 14 th century.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Uncommonly for a drow , Susztam appeared somewhat plump and seemed almost meek upon cursory inspection. He customarily wore dark shirts of grey and black trousers . Susztam wrapped himself in a spider-web patterned cloak of arachnida .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Although appearing less hardened than others of his race, Susztam Mar-Shinn was just as malicious and ambitious as the rest of his kin. Testament to this was his dream of eventually surpassing and taking over from his master, Solom Ned'razak , as archmage of the Inverted Tower .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Noted as Solom Ned'razak's best student, Susztam was a skilled illusionist and also a practitioner of the Shadow Weave . Since delving into the secrets of the Shadow Weave, his illusions were empowered by his understanding and noticeably harder to dispel.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Bow, 1354 DR , Susztam became the head student of the Inverted Tower under Solom Ned'razak's tutelage. At least until 1372 DR , during the Silence of Lolth and the coup of Szith Morcane by worshipers of Kiaransalee , Susztam maintained this position through careful preparations against any intruders.</p>
