<p>Magic-suppression cuffs were bracelets or manacles that prevented the wearer from casting spells or using other magical abilities.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Magic-suppression cuffs were worn loosely about the wrist, and consisted of two overlapping loops of golden metal that met at a lock. A cuff was locked or unlocked with a key.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Anyone who wore a magic-suppression cuff was unable to call upon their magical abilities, including spellcasting or powers such as wild shape . Only a single cuff on one wrist was necessary to subdue the magic of even a mighty wizard . It was not necessary that the cuff be secured tightly to take effect.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the High Sun Games were revived in Neverwinter during the late 1490s DR , magic-suppression cuffs were placed on spellcasting participants to prevent them from using magic to survive the Games. A collection of such cuffs , along with their keys, was maintained in a storage area beneath Neverwinter arena .</p>
<p>As part of the Games, a group of adventurers and thieves— Edgin Darvis , Holga Kilgore , Simon Aumar , and Doric —were sent into the Games to die by Lord Forge Fitzwilliam and the Red Wizard Sofina . Magic-suppression cuffs were placed on both the sorcerer Simon and the druid Doric, who confirmed that they were unable to use their magical abilities while wearing them. However, Doric was able to lose her cuff after her arm became stuck in a gelatinous cube , and the loose-fitting manacle came off when she pulled out her arm. Subsequently, the party escaped beneath the Arena and found the keys to remove Simon's cuff . When they later fought the powerful Sofina, the party only managed to win by deceiving her into letting down her guard so that Edgin's daughter, Kira , could sneak up using her pendant of invisibility and affix Simon's magic-suppression cuff onto Sofina's wrist.</p>
