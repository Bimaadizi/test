<p>A mirror of madness was a phenomenon that acted as a viewing portal into the Abyss , functioning as a window; those who gazed upon it risked madness . The mirror was always positioned on a wall.</p>
<p>The mirror of madness was created when Abyssal cults corrupted a location for several years. The mirror recognized the cultists and their allies as allies and any other creatures as enemies, and acted as a trap for the latter. Those attacked could experience effects from immobilization to domination of their will. If the mirror was physically attacked, it would lash out at the surrounding creatures.</p>
<p>Creatures with rogueish , arcane , or divine inclinations had the greatest chances of resisting the mirror's effects and destroying it simply by standing in its proximity. Once destroyed, the mirror's effects ceased.</p>
