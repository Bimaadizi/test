<p>The Lionshield Coster , also called the Lionshields , was a merchant company based in the fortified city of Yartar , that operated throughout the greater Dessarin Valley during the 15 th century DR .</p>
<p>The merchant company's symbol was a image of a lion's head placed upon a wooden or metal shield . In some instances the lion was colored blue, while in others it was emblazoned over a blue background.</p>
<h2>Bases of Operation</h2>
<p>The merchant company were able to ship finished goods, such as supplies of armor and weapons , to small settlements and towns all throughout the northwestern region of Faer√ªn .</p>
<p>One such settlement was the newly settled frontier town of Phandalin near the Triboar Trail and the Sword Mountains . The town's trading post was overseen by Linene Graywind . The organization also had a trading post in Nightstone , run by Darthag Ulgar , and a store called the Lion's Share in Triboar , managed by Narth Tezrin and Alaestra Ulgar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time during the late 15 th century, the trading post in Nightstone was sacked by a band of goblin led by Boss Hark after the town itself was devastated by a cloud giant .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR , incoming shipments to the Phandalin post were not received, indicating that bandit activity in the area had seized the goods. Linene Graywind mistakenly believed these raids were caused by the Redbrands bandits and refused to sell them weapons. The missing shipments were actually caused by goblins from the Cragmaw tribe .</p>
