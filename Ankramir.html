<p>The Principality of Ankramir was the southwestern principality of Tethyr .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Ankramir included the duchies of Kamlann , the Purple Marches , and Ankaram , and was the location of Tethyr's former capital and largest city, Zazesspur .</p>
<p>The region was sparsely populated, relative to other areas of Tethyr. In cultural feel, it was akin to Calimshan , which bordered it to the south.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Formally, this principality was under the authority of Princess Cyriana Rhindaun in 1370 DR , who was the daughter of Queen Zaranda Star Rhindaun and her consort King Haedrak Rhindaun III . Since the princess was a young child at that time, the ruling of the principality was handled by Cyriana's regent, Vajra Valmeyjar , the Duchess of Ankaram.</p>
