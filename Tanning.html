<p>Tanning and tawing was the process of working a raw animal skin into usable leather and its variaties such as parchment and vellum . Though a vital part of producing tough clothing and the fittings for all sorts of finished products, it was an intensive and rather unpleasant process. A person that worked in the tanning industry was known as a tanner.</p>
<h2>Production</h2>
<p>From the raw hides sourced from a wide variety of animals (or even people), they would be scraped free of hair and flesh with specialized knives to produce a smooth uniform material. The thinner the animal's skin, the more delicate the work would become, with rabbits requiring a wooden "knife" to gently prepare it. Beyond this, the cleaning and preservation of leather required the extensive use of large amounts of noxious chemicals, like lime , tannic acid , and vinegar . The hides were soaked in barrels full of these substances for weeks or months, with varying concentrations depending on the stage of work.</p>
<p>Many tanneries had attached leatherworking shops, which turned the leather into finished goods like boots and riding tack . Others simply sold their product for artisans to use elsewhere.</p>
<h2>Practice</h2>
<p>In some areas, the professions of skinners, tanners, and leatherworkers were controlled or regulated by trade guilds , like the League of Skinners and Tanners in Waterdeep , which supplied the bulk of leather used by artisans of other guilds such as the Saddlers' and Harness-makers' Guild , Order of Cobblers and Corvisers , and Order of Master Tailors, Glovers, and Mercers .</p>
<p>Because of the foul smell and toxic waste produced by tanning and tawing, tanneries were almost always kept on the outskirts of towns, downriver, or entirely separated.</p>
