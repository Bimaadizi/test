<p>The Scarlet Sheath was a tavern located in the city of Wheloon in Cormyr . Its proprietor was Anthara Shalymarr .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The building was once an abandoned ruin, until was taken over and lightly renovated by Anthara Shalymarr. She turned it into the Scarlet Sheath tavern by 1358 DR .</p>
<p>On more than one occasion, Zhentarim agents assassinated people in the Sheath by sticking long blades through the tapestries and holes in the walls.</p>
<p>The famed traveller Volothamp Geddarm once visited the tavern and said he liked it.</p>
<p>The Scarlet Sheath was still in operation by 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>Structure & Interior</h2>
<p>The tavern was quite obviously once a burned and ruined building, and still looked like it. Anthara simply and determinedly nailed tapestries over the holes and burn marks. Thus, the interior was dusty and seedy, and resembled a dilapidated harem. The furniture was very comfortable.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The regular patrons were quick to defend the waitresses from patrons who mistreated them, while Anthara was handy at throwing a knife at any who got too lusty with her.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Scarlet Sheath was the local drinking hole of Wheloon. Many tired farmers went there at the end of a working day, as did merchants passing through. It provided comfortable furniture and swift service from the pretty and friendly waitresses.</p>
<p>Anthara held that a tavern should be separate from daily matters, where people could talk freely. She had an agreement with Lord Sarp Redbeard , ruler of Wheloon, that patrons would not be held responsible for things said while in her tavern. Thus, the Sheath served as a "fire flume" or safety valve, as a useful outlet for locals to vent their feelings. It also served for illicit dealings, though anyone could overhear such conversations.</p>
<p>Volo said he liked the Scarlet Sheath, but recommended that fussy or cautious travellers go elsewhere.</p>
