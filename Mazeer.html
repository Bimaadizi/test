<p>Mazeer was a member of the College of Conjuration in the city of Sshamath .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Haunting, 1377 DR , alongside Gilkriz , Mazeer was one of the conjurers sent to help teleport the combined force of Sshamath wizards and priests of Eilistraee to the main temple of Kiaransalee , which they planned to attack.</p>
<p>Later, she, along with Telmyz, a Nightshadow , were scouting underwater tunnels for a way to locate Kiaransalee 's temple. But they were attacked by a giant water spider . Telmyz was yanked out of the water and Mazeer summoned a water elemental that broke two of the spider's legs and turned into a powerful whirlpool. Although the water elemental fought on her behalf, the whirlpool it created slammed her against the surrounding rocks, breaking a rib and injuring her hand. With her last gulp of air, she commanded the water elemental to get her out of the water, which it did. When the water elemental destroyed the spider, she realized that she was the first to arrive at the place where the temple was located but was attacked by an undead creature. Despite rebuking the undead's assault, it damaged her psyche. Mazeer slowly lost her mind and unintentionally killed herself by falling into the water and drowning.</p>
<p>After the destruction of Kiaransalee and of the Voidstone , the priestesses of Eilistraee went out to search for her body in order to bring it back to the Promenade of the Dark Maiden and try to resuscitate her.</p>
