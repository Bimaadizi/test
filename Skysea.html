<p>The Skysea was a zone in the Raurin where an ancient magical battle had reduced the sand to glass across a span of miles. At its center lay the Isle of the Cursed , still holding the ruins of Medinat Muskawoon .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The ground seemed to drop into a sea much like the sky as one approached the edge. The surface mirrored the dunes around, and the clouds above. No opposite shore was visible, only the sky and the clouds merging into the horizon. The air was dry, and so hot that it was dangerous to breathe. A dark island, seemingly afloat in the sky, was visible through the haze of heat. The glass averaged a depth of 10 feet (3 meters), being too hard to crack for most creatures.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Skysea was approximately 40 miles (64 kilometers) across. It lay about 500 miles (800 kilometers) north of the Dustwall Mountains . One of the branches of the dry bed of the River Athis led into it, having once fed the lake around Medinat Muskawoon. The Isle of the Cursed lay in the approximate middle of it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Skysea was created after a battle between the wizard Martek and the efreet Khalitharius left a magical flame that burned for twenty years over the landscape, creating a huge sea of melted glass.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Purple worms existed beneath Skysea, and sometimes hunted by cracking the glass if they felt vibrations above. Skittercrabs were unique to the area, and could be dangerous at times. Everything else that dwelled in the Skysea was either an apparition or undead , some of which rode cloudskates .</p>
<h2>Hazards</h2>
<p>On the Skysea itself, the air was outright deadly by day, even if not breathed; this effect increased the further one was from the shore, reaching a maximum at 100 feet (30 meters) from the shore. Some spots became even hotter as the Skysea concentrated the sun's rays. Going through the Skysea without a cloudskate was suicidal for most.</p>
