<p>The Hammer of Tyr was a holy relic of the church of Tyr , god of justice.</p>
<p>A powerful weapon against evil and the undead , it could cast extraordinarily powerful turn undead and sunray spells, as well as heal allies. The Hammer could be also be used as a +5 warhammer and when thrown it returned to the wielder's hand.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Hammer' s greatest power was to destroy pools of darkness when thrown into its waters.</p>
