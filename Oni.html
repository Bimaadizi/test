<p>Among animals, oni preferred black-colored ones.</p>
<p>Oni also were very fond of treasures of all varieties. Some oni would swallow their treasures to protect them, regurgitating them later.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Oni often lived in desolate areas, or they might make homes along highways or within cities, living in disguise. In rare cases, they might even rule over small human villages.</p>

<p>Males and females were equally powerful.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The origin of oni remained a mystery to scholars. Many believed that they were the corrupted spirits of evil humans, but others thought them to have been created specifically by the Celestial Bureaucracy to test humans and establish a balance between good and evil. Still others saw many similarities between the oni of the east and the ogres of the west and argued that they were in fact related races, or that oni were related to trolls. Other sages told the tale that oni were descended from the god Vaprak 's three sons, Anori , Hakuni , and Muaj .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>It was said that an island populated almost exclusively by oni was said to exist somewhere in the Celestial Sea , but if true, no human explorer had ever found the island and returned. Strangely, the island was said to be guarded by thousands of one-foot tall black oni with powers as great as larger oni.</p>
<p>It was rumored that amethysts could repel oni.</p>
