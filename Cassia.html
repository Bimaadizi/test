<p>Cassia trees were found in the Sword of Anauroch , and harvested by the Bedine . The Bedine usually traded plant resins such as cassia, myrrh, frankincense, and dragons' blood to the D'tarig and other outsiders in exchange for metals they couldn't obtain otherwise. The D'tarig were their most common trade partner and also harvested cassia and other resins themselves, typically selling it on to Zhentarim merchants who then exported it to the rest of the Realms .</p>
