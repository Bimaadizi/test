<p>Castle Grimstead , originally founded as Castle Greatstead , was a castle in Shadowdale , in the Dalelands .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>North of the castle was cavenauth , a cave mouth that lead down into the Shadowdark .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 834 DR , Castle Greatstead is constructed by the adventuring company Glittering Band with the aim of driving back the drow who inhabited the nearby Twisted Tower .</p>
<p>In 864 DR , the castle was overrun a combination of drow forces from above and below the ground and partially destroyed by explosions.</p>
<p>Circa 1367 DR , the castle's walls were pitching at dangerous angles and the wood had mostly rotted away. It was uninhabited at that time. By 1375 DR , the Zhentarim occasionally patrolled the areas, viewing it as a potential hideout for rebels. By this time the cellars of Grimstead had also been made connected to the Shadowdark.</p>
