<p>The Burning Truth was a larger-than-life bardic band that venerated the fire deity Kossuth through explosive performances of percussive instruments, chanting, and pyrotechnics in Ravens Bluff in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>When The Burning Truth was discovered by the Bards' Guild of Ravens Bluff , the band consisted of six members: Aranwe Nauril , the lead and bongo player; Javert Lorrell , who wielded various percussion instruments and chanted; Jennith Maelstrom , a chanter who played the kettle drum ; Gnorris Kneebreaker , the man in charge of a massive bass drum , playing it from within, as well as pyrotechnics; Demonius Othello Tiburian Lethario III , the handler of a Kara-Turan war gong , wielder of flames, and the group's religious advisor; and lastly, Dirtbeard , who played koto drums .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The band was discovered in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , by the Bards' Guild of Ravens Bluff after the recent death of The Cobalt Flame , which led many to think that the Ravenaar theater scene was to enter a lull. An aspiring politician who'd recently lost an election, Harmony of Milil , had assembled a new band, a choir of romantic youths. Yet the famous bard was not the talk of the town. In contrast with Harmony of Milil's group was The Burning Truth, a rambunctious band of drummers accompanied by heavy pyrotechnics. The band's debut was reported on by Jacinth Moonspring in the pages of the Ravens Bluff Trumpeter . According to Jacinth, The Burning Truth was looking for another singer, or, as she put it in print, "a true singer." Jacinth also complimented the band's grand pyrotechnics and found the music to be quite enjoyable.</p>
<p>The new band was in a bit of a brewing storm, however, as they worshiped Kossuth, the God of Fire, and their performances openly venerated the deity without approval or authorization from the Clerical Circle of Ravens Bluff. Jacinth did note that, despite the performances of Harmony of Milil being veneration of Milil and The Burning Truth's being worship of Kossuth, for most of those who listened to both bands' music, it was just that: music.</p>
<p>By the next year, The Burning Truth's performances were regularly hosted by the Ravens Bluff Opera House , while the band operated out of the city's Temple of Tyr .</p>
