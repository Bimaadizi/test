<p>Death knives were a variety of concealed knives used by rogues .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These weapons could be made to resemble a variety of different inconspicuous objects, such as some form of tool, a quill pen , a case for a comb or spectacles , or more rarely a bladeless knife. The blade of a death knife was concealed within barrel and spring-loaded, shooting forward once a user pressed upon some catch on the object's handle.</p>
<p>The level of concealment for these knives was far from fool-proof, as they could be discerned from any close inspection. Additionally, some models were known to leak out any poison laced upon their blades.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>These knives varied in their legality. While some of the more liberal and shady parts of the Realms allowed for their sale, in many other parts they were considered to be illegal. But even in areas where they were technically legal to acquire, doing so was no small feet.</p>
