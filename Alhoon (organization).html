<p>The Alhoon were a group of mind flayer students that studied under the great Netherese arcanist , Ioulaum .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Alhoon were illithids of Ellyn'taal and embraced lichdom under the guidance of their teacher.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Sundered Webs, −339 DR , Ioulaum permanently left his enclave in Netheril and from then on lived in his Underdark base, which was near the city of Ellyn'taal. Ioulaum, who was a lich, took apprentices from this city of mind flayers. This group of students went on become the first illithiliches , and named themselves the Alhoon.</p>
<p>The Alhoon studied under the Netherese lich until the Year of the Closed Scroll, 329 DR . At this time, Ioulaum used the minds of the Alhoon to create an undead elder brain . After this, Ioulaum merged his sentience with it, becoming the Oracle of Ellyn'taal. Though most members of the Alhoon were destroyed in the creation of the elder brain, some of them escaped to other parts of the Underdark. Some believed that these illithiliches actually killed Ioulaum, though this was not true.</p>
