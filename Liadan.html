<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , as the Cult of the Absolute planted its roots in Baldur's Gate and ravaged the Western Heartlands , Felogyr's Fireworks shop fell under the cult's sway. Its proprietor, Avery Sonshal , was made into a True Soul and used the shop as a front for the cult's terrorist activities. During that time, Liadan was employed as a Feloguard, standing guard of the shop's first floor and Avery himself, as he dealt with regular customers, selling them fireworks . Liadan knowingly or unknowingly also guarded the shop's areas that were off-limits to all but the Banite members of the Cult of the Absolute.</p>
