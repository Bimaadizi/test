<p>A chatkcha ( pronounced : /ˈ tʃ ɑː t k tʃ ɑː / CHAT-k-cha ) was a type of exotic throwing weapon invented by the thri-kreen and unique to them.</p>
<p>The chatkcha was a kind of triangular throwing wedge with three piercing points. The thri-kreen carved it from a crystalline material. It could deal critical injuries to a target, and was effective to 20 feet (6 meters) and could be thrown up to 270 feet (82 meters). A thrown wedge that missed its target could even return to the thrower.</p>
<p>A warrior needed to be highly trained to use one, as it would cut an unprotected hand, but it was much more familiar to the thri-kreen. Collectors would pay for one in good condition.</p>
