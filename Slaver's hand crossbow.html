<p>The slaver's hand crossbow was a type of fine drow repeating light crossbow used by House Avithoul in the mid-1480s DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The crossbow automatically coated each bolt with a mixture of poisons that weakened and incapacitated those they struck, even putting them to sleep on the spot.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These crossbows were a result of House Avithoul's development of alchemy and weaponry, and were specialized for incapacitating slaves non-lethally. Slavemaster Banister Avithoul in particular carried one, and when Cormyr attacked House Avithoul inside Sschindylryn they may have claimed them as prizes.</p>
