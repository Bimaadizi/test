<p>A Thayan golem was a variety of golem constructed and sold exclusively by the Red Wizards of Thay . They were vigilant sentries for those who wanted to enjoy the distinct "golem-enhanced lifestyle".</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>On a superficial level, a Thayan golem represented a humanoid guardsman standing 6 ft (1.8 m) tall. They were formed from polished Thayan oak but bore no markings that linked them to their native Thay.</p>
<p>One of the golem's forearms was replaced by a built-in longbow . The golem was quite skilled with the weapon, capable of mimicking the combat feats of skilled archers.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>While Thayan golems lacked the comprehensive spell immunity enjoyed by most other forms of golem, they were completely impervious to magic missiles . They maintained the usual immunities poison , diseases , energy drains , as well as mind-altering spells and effects.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The origins of Thayan golems traced back to the first attempts the Red Wizards made to establish one of their enclaves in the Dalelands . The native Dalesman rebuked the golems as shameful and extravagant due to their cultural appreciation for archery and longbows as weapons.</p>
<p>The Red Wizards then tried a different tact, offering their golems for sale to the neighboring nation of Sembia , as a defense against the brigands of the Dales. Since then, they have garnered the reputation as something of a status symbol among Sembian merchants.</p>
<p>As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , the process for constructing a Thayan golem remained a secret known only to the Red Wizards. The minimum price at which they would sell one of these constructs was about forty thousand gold pieces .</p>
