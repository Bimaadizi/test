<p>The Gilded Feather was a pretty-parlor, or beauty salon, located in Suzail , the capital of Cormyr in the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Gilded Feather stood on Suzail's grand Promenade , two city blocks west of Castle Obarskyr with Danain's hardware store and the Witch-Duke's Bride as its neighbors to the east. By the late 15 th century DR , the Gilded Feather was the most prestigious and expensive pretty-parlor in Suzail. The shop's staff and proprietors scoffed at masked dancers from less reputable establishments in the city.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Lord Arclath Delcastle sponsored Amarune Whitewave 's fellow masked dancers from the Dragonriders Club to be primped at the Gilded Feather at great expense, despite the pretty-parlor's sneering attitude towards these common dancers.</p>
