<p>The Book of Shangalar the Black was one of the spellbooks of the former Grand Vizar of Calimshan , and runemaster of the Twisted Rune known as Shangalar . It was one volume within the collection of the lich 's larger body of work.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This surprisingly heavy tome was thinner than a finger and had a blank cover, save for the name " Shangalar " written in Thorass on the bottom-right corner. It contained four pages of electrum , linked to the binding with small, tarnished silver rings.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After forgoing the leadership as Grand Vizar, but before achieving lichdom, Shangalar journeyed through a ruined city in the desert of Anauroch and was robbed of his spellbook by the master thief , Athchos the Black . Athchos escaped the desert wasteland for Iriaebor , where he proceeded to recite the book to a cabal of wizards led by Orlstar Meir for the tome's reproduction. The thief then attempted to lease the tome to a mage in Elturel but was slain by a swarm of crawling claws . Although the book was lost, Shangalar renamed himself "Shangalar the Black", a designation of pride for his slaying of the thief.</p>
<p>The spellbook popped up years later in Neverwinter , having been unmistakably recited by a sage named Ourgos . Soon after it was stolen by agents operating out of Luskan and its whereabouts have been unknown since.</p>
