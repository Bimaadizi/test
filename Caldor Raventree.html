<h2>History</h2>
<p>Caldor Raventree was one of the War Wizards that had tried to capture Marlin Stormserpent after the calamitous Council of the Dragon in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR . After the raid on Stormserpent Towers was cut short because of deadly poisonous smoke, Caldor reported it took sixteen spells to clear it out. He also reported seven had died, and more were likely to die in the aftermath due to inhalation. Raventree also volunteered to interrogate the survivors for any clues on Marlin's whereabouts. Blamreld rejected that, believing that Caldor would treat the survivors as suspects.</p>
