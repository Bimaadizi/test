<p>House Gulderhorn was a noble family of the kingdom of Tethyr and later the city-state of Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Gulderhorns adopted the obscure goddess Siamorphe as their deity sometime after fleeing from Tethyr. It was unknown if this occurred whilst on the road to the City of Splendors, perhaps when the family were passing through the city of Baldur's Gate , or if it happened within Waterdeep itself. They had prominent roles within the church , running the Chapel and Chalice of the Divine Right .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>In the city of Waterdeep, the Gulderhorns lived in the Assumbar Villa in the city's Sea Ward . Back in Tethyr, the family were the lords and ladies of County Morninggold , part of the duchy of Golden Marches and the Principality of the Iltkazar Highlands . Their properties in the county included Morninggold Keep , estates east of it, and a fortified manor in the county's southern reaches called Mount Noblesse .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The family had a relatively good marriage-bound alliance with the Assumbar noble family. Whilst the rumors that circulated around them both due to the Gulderhorns' faith were a source of bemused pride for the patriarch of the Assumbars, Lady Circe Assumbar detested the Siamorphan faith, which in turn impeded the continued development of Siamorphan worship in Waterdeep and kindled tensions with the Gulderhorns' matriarch.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Bright Blade, 1347 DR , as the Ten Black Days of Eleint ravaged Tethyr, the Gulderhorns fled the kingdom, finding a new home in the city-state of Waterdeep. There the Gulderhorn matriarch secured her family a place among the nobility by marrying her daughter off to Lord Laeros Assumbar , patriarch of House Assumbar. In their absence, Sheriff Peren Voranwell would occupy the Gulderhorn estates back in Tethyr, claiming he was protecting both it and the nearby village of tenant farmers from "raiders and looters".</p>
<p>In the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , amidst the Time of Troubles , a group of nine young nobles banded together to defend the city's Sea Ward from the undead minions of Myrkul . Under the leadership of Marquise Scion Aalangama Gulderhorn , a minor Siamorphan priest , the nobles managed to halt the invaders outside of Moonstar Villa . Due in part to the religious practices of the Gulderhorns, rumors circulated during this time that Siamorphe herself had manifested in Assumbar Villa and protected both the North and Sea Wards from suffering large-scale damage at the hands of Myrkul.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the Time of Troubles, Aalangama received a vision, an edict, from Siamorphe. It pushed her to gather together a number of Waterdhavian nobles, as well as nobles of Tethyrian birth, who had either escaped the Ten Black Days of Eleint and its ensuing chaos themselves or were the children of nobles who had. Together they traveled to Tethyr, set on fulfilling Siamorphe's edict of restoring the kingdom from its state of anarchy and finding a proper heir to its throne. In the month of Alturiak they would arrive and declare themselves to be a new knighthood , the Order of the Silver Chalice .</p>
<p>At some point during their stay in Tethyr, the Order took back control of Morninggold Keep, using it as base of operations. In the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , Aalangama and her knights visited the long-abandoned Gulderhorn estates and found Lord Voranwell suffering from delusional insanity , convinced he was a monster. They tried to keep the mad man at bay with their spears , but in his delusions he impaled himself upon them.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , a former adventuress and commander in the Tuigan War Zaranda Star , used the spoils of that war to purchase the Gulderhorns' titles to County Morninggold and its keep from the Order of the Silver Chalice, who needed operating money to continue their efforts in restoring nobility in Tethyr. However, they would maintain ownership of Mount Noblesse, opting to use it as their new base of operations. From then on, Aalangama and the Order fought in support of Zaranda in the Reclamation Wars .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , on Mirtul 3 , Zaranda Star was proclaimed queen of Tethyr by the citizens of Zazesspur , ushering in the Rhindaun Dynasty . In gratitude to the Order of the Silver Chalice for their valiant efforts, Queen-Monarch Zaranda recognized them as a knightly order and restored the Gulderhorn family's rights and titles to County Morninggold.</p>
