<p>Jhingleshod ( pronounced : /ˈ dʒ ɪ ŋ g ʊl ʃ ɑː d / JING-gul-shahd ), also known as The Iron Axeman , was the former man-at-arms and nearly immortal adversary to the wizard Wulgreth of Ascalhorn that later became an undead knight. He served as Wulgreth's servant in life during the 9 th century DR and his eternal stalker in undeath during the centuries that followed.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>From a distance, Jhingleshod appeared as a knight of the Realms, albeit in rust-stained armor. Upon closer examination however, his form resembled that of animated armor , with skin formed of interlinking plates of iron . His visage was that of a soulless skeleton, with two vein-streaked eyes that were black as coal .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Since his own lifeforce was connected to Wulgreth, Jhingleshod could only truly die and be at rest when Wulgreth was no more.</p>
<p>Jhingleshod's unfortunate demeanor was a direct result of his tortured existence. As he roamed his woods, the Iron Axeman remained aloof and disconnected from others, save for when he saw opportunity to end it all, when he reacted with outbursts of desperation and obsession. He remained suspicious of others that claimed they could release him from his curse, fearful of and threatened by the inevitability of being tricked once again.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He always carried with him a massive axe , a weapon that was too unwieldy for most mortal men.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Jhingleshod was all-but indestructible while the undead Wulgreth remained on Toril. His iron-formed body could reform itself as if he were mere pieces of metallic clay being combined together.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As of the late 14 th century DR, Jhingleshod spent his entire existence roaming around the Dire Wood searching for some means to destroy Wulgreth and finally achieve peace.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Giant's Oath, 883 DR , Jhingleshod left Hellgate Keep with his master Wulgreth, who was fleeing from the influx of fiends . They traveled to the ruins of Karse where Wulgreth hoped to gain power from the petrified body of Karsus . While in the midst of casting a powerful epic spell , Jhingleshod turned on his master and slew him to prevent him from summoning more fiends. The mis-cast magic released a massive amount of arcane energy at once and transformed Wulgreth into a lich . The blast also transformed the area of the High Forest into what later came to be known as the Dire Wood, a patch of petrified trees that became overrun with undead.</p>
<p>The undead mage hunted Jhingleshod down and punished his former servant by torturing him until death.</p>
<h3>Undeath</h3>
<p>Just as his master, Jhingleshod arose as an undead monstrosity, cursed by his failure to slay Wulgreth. He remained trapped within the blighted wood he helped form, unable to undo his how existence until the lich Wulgreth was destroyed.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Jhingleshod encountered the Evereskan tomb guardian Galaeron Nihmedu , along with his companions Vala Thorsdotter , Melegaunt Tanthul , and Malik el Sami , as the group passed through the Dire Wood. After assessing Galaeron's character, Jhingleshod offered him a bargain: he would guide the elf and his allies to the Karsestone in exchange for their help in destroying Wulgrath.</p>
<p>Jhingelshod and his companions traveled for some distance and eventually arrived at a black pyramid set atop the Karsus Butte , the petrified remains of the ascended arcanist after which it was named. After venturing within, they destroyed a demilich hoping it to be the remains of Wulgreth. Unfortunately they were mistaken, as the undead remains were merely those of an ancient sharn imprisoned within. After spending some time investigating the pyramid's inner chambers by magical means, Galaeron and Melegaunt came to the conclusion they could find no clues as to Wulgreth's whereabouts nor his phylactery .</p>
<p>Just as Jhingelshod resigned their efforts to failure, the lich Wulgrenth ambushed them just as they entered the chamber with the Karsestone . A fierce battle broke out and eventually Galaeron cleaved the lich's skull in half. At Jhingleshod's direction, they gathered its remains and began the search for his phylactery. After staying overnight within the black pyramid and having no luck with their search, it gradually dawned on nearly all the members of the group the Karsestone itself was Wulgreth's phylactery. Cursed by Mystra to always speak the truth, Malik inadvertently shared this revelation out loud, triggering Jhingleshod's paranoia and rage.</p>
<p>Believing they wanted to steal the Karsestone with no intent of helping destroy Wulgreth, Jhingleshod attacked them all and nearly killed Vala. Galaeron drew upon the whole magic that permeated the Karsestone and shot a beam of gold energy, blasting the Iron Axeman in half. That was not enough to stop Jhingleshod, as his top half clung on to Galaeron as both they and the Karsestone shot out of Karsus' remains into the pool below. Jhingleshod's two halves reformed just as the Karsestone ascended into the skies and a mountain descended in its place . Jhingleshod's ultimate fate was unknown however, as it was believed that Wulgreth's undead remains were already reforming within the stone corpse of Karse.</p>
