<p>Zoartik was one of the most violent mind flayers of Ch'Chitl in 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Zoartik suffered from a mental problem: he could not completely sublimate the mind of his original drow host. This caused homicidal reactions every time that Zoartik saw drow or even drow-made items. Unconsciously, Zoartik was trying to finally suppress the remains of the drow personality</p>
