<p>The Berun's River was the largest and the easternmost tributary of the Neverwinter River , located in the Neverwinter Wood .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The river's mouth was located in the foothills just north of Berun's Hill , east of the Neverwinter Wood. The river flowed west until it merged with the Neverwinter River. Like other tributaries, Berun's River waters were warm and teemed with fish , turtles , and other aquatic life. Thankfully, unlike the River Morgur , Berun's River had no "river monsters" inhabiting its waters.</p>
