<p>House Illance was a noble house of Cormyr based in Suzail .</p>
<h2>Holdings</h2>
<p>Although the family was based in Suzail, it had deep roots in Marsember and owned many properties through a complicated web of small companies bearing the names of others. The family owned a palatial home in Marsember known as "Iyrinthorn", and a summer house at Stag Well .</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>The family's menfolk were notorious womanizers and were frequent patrons of Mask Dance clubs. The family was involved in some illicit dealings, and persistent local rumors of ongoing slaving operations using their Marsember-based vessels and warehouses plagued the family.</p>
<p>The House was an enemy of the House Cormaeril .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some members of the family plotted with Luthax against King Draxius in the Year of the Empty Hearth, 629 DR .</p>
<p>Several unnamed members fought with King Galaghard III against the Witch-Lords in the Year of the Thirsty Sword, 900 DR .</p>
<p>House Illance was among those who fought with Arangor and King Azoun II against the dragon Thauglor in the Year of the Dracorage, 1018 DR , where one of their houses in Suzail was destroyed.</p>
<p>House Illance slowly lost influence at the Royal Court over generations, and weak family leaders poorly managed and invested the family fortune, but the family was never in ruin.</p>
<p>By 1479 DR , the family's fortunes had improved through deals with the Seven Suns Trading Company .</p>
