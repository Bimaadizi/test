<h2>Relationships</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Born in 1098 DR , Imbrar was the eldest son of King Imphras I and Queen Sambral. He was a paladin like his father before him.</p>
<p>Imbrar became king in 1122 DR at his father's death. His short reign ended in 1127 DR when he vanished during a military campaign against the hobgoblins of the Giantspire Mountains. His sister had observed the hobgoblins rebuilding their forces through one of the Scrying Stones , so the king had marched against them. Neither the army nor the hobgoblins were ever seen again. With grief, Ilmara took the throne after her lost brother.</p>
<p>What Ilmara never learned was that her brother had been changed into a death knight by the succubus Soneillon .</p>
