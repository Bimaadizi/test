<p>The heavy boltslinger was a kind of repeating heavy crossbow found in the mines of Tethyamar during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This crossbow was especially effective at penetrating armor, and was imbued with powerful electrical energy that shocked those it hit.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Using the excellent drow hand crossbows as a base, weapon designers went to work on scaling the weapon up to a more efficient crossbow. The heavy boltslinger was an experimental prototype from this effort, and was found in Ironvale Deep after the defeat of Kir'tan Melarn , an agent of House Argith as they invaded Tethyamar.</p>
