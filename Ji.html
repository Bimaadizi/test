<p>Ji was a town in Tabot , central Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It lay in the southern foothills of the Po Yul Dzayul Range , at the end of the Lokar Pass on the road between Draya and Chophon . South of Ji, roads led east and west to Tsetu and U'Chan Gompa . The road between Ji and U'Chan Gompa was safe and saw heavy traffic around Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) .</p>
<p>Above the town of Ji stood Noko-Ji Peak , and its name meant "the blow high over Ji".</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the soldiers of Shou Lung invaded and seized the whole of northern Tabot in Shou Year 894 (−356 DR) , with the fate of the nation hanging in the balance, artisans in Ji fashioned the five crystalline warriors and a group of great dang-ki and wu jen animated them and gave them magical abilities. On the third day of the fifth month, the ragged defenders of Tabot and their five crystalline warriors confronted the Shou Lung army as they marched out of Lokar Pass. Though the battle was terrific, they were victorious, and went on to reclaim all of the conquered lands. The crystalline warriors went into the mountains to await the day when Tabot again had need of them. The date of the battle would be considered holy and celebrated as Crystal Day.</p>
