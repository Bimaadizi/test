<p>History of the Crusade was a book written by the bard Thom Reaverson in the early 1360s DR . It gave a careful and unbiased account of King Azoun IV 's crusade against the Tuigan Horde in the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the war, Thom Reaverson wrote History of the Crusade while in Suzail , Cormyr , at the king's request. At the time, he provided translations and guidance for Koja of Khazari , who was a guest of Azoun in Suzail for over a year and who, also at the king's request, wrote up an account of his experiences with the Tuigan. Koja felt History of the Crusade was a more complete account of the war than his own.</p>
<h2>Locations</h2>
<p>One copy was in the possession of King Azoun IV of Cormyr in the early 1360s DR . By 1362 DR , the temple of Deneir in the city of Procampur in the Vast had a copy, bound together with Koja 's Life among the Tuigan .</p>
