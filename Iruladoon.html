<p>Iruladoon was a quasi-extraplanar forest that was located on the eastern bank of Lac Dinneshere in Icewind Dale . It was created by Mielikki specifically for her apparent Chosen , Drizzt Do'Urden , in order to house and instruct his friends, the Companions of the Hall , prior to their reincarnations.</p>
<p>Catti-brie and Regis were the first to arrive here after their deaths in 1385 DR . Although from the point of view of the outside world they spent nearly eight decades there, it seemed to them as mere tendays . Catti-brie spent her time dancing and singing, gaining instruction from the goddess Mielikki. Wulfgar was next to arrive after his own death, and then Bruenor Battlehammer in 1462 DR . Catti-brie explained to them that Drizzt was going to be in trouble, so they had the opportunity to be reincarnated to meet him in 21 years on Kelvin's Cairn in Icewind Dale . Although Regis was eager to help his friend, Wulfgar and Bruenor were more reluctant. Wulfgar decided to move on to the afterlife to wait for him, (although he later changed his mind, ) but the other three were reborn on Toril in the year 1463 DR .</p>
<p>In 1466 DR , Drizzt Do'Urden and his companions at the time ( Dahlia Sin'felle , Artemis Entreri , Ambergris , Afafrenfere , and Effron ) presumably spent a night here that turned out to last eighteen years in the outside world. . The demiplane seemed to disappear after they woke up in 1484 DR .</p>
