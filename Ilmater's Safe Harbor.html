<p>Ilmater's Safe Harbor was a soup kitchen, run by the Ilmatari priestess Mother Brenia , in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep in the late 15 th century DR . It was known to be frequented by almost every beggar in that ward.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The building's layout consisted of a cooking area, a dining room, a small room in the back, and a cellar. These rooms were provided illumination by means of lanterns and a heavy, iron chandelier of candles .</p>
<p>Within the building's cellar was a hidden door, which opened to rough-hewn rock tunnels leading into the Warrens .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Being a soup kitchen, this establishment provided free meals for the impoverished citizens of the Dock Ward. Additionally, in the building's small back room, Mother Brenia tended to the sick.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In addition to Mother Brenia, the soup kitchen was run by a number of volunteers, as the elderly priestess could not afford to have a paid staff with the shoestring budget she ran the establishment on. Some of the known volunteers included Niela Snowdrop , Rik Milsean , and Ulmani .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point during the late 15 th century DR there was a string of disappearances of both beggars and stray dogs in the Dock Ward. This began not long after Ulmani, Rik Milesan, and some others began volunteering at the soup kitchen.</p>
<p>A month later, the City Watchman Girnan Svann found himself frustrated at his superiors' not viewing the string of disappearances as something worth looking into. He went on to hire a group of adventurers at the Blue Mermaid to investigate, informing them that each missing beggar was connected to Ilmater's Safe Harbor, but that it could be a false lead.</p>
<p>Looking around the establishment, the adventurers eventually discovered its hidden cellar door. Traveling through it, they came upona group of thugs dressed as Sharrans and accompanied by horribly mutated dogs and wolves . After beating up the thugs, the adventurers recognized some of them as the newer volunteers and that their Sharran identities were merely a red herring to distract from the mysterious mage they were truly kidnapping people for.</p>
