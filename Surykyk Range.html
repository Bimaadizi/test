<p>The Surykyk Range was a frozen chain of mountains in southern Alpuk in the Great Glacier .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The slopes of the Surykyk Range were icy and barren, and the wind and snow quickly covered any tracks. Some of the peaks concealed networks of tunnels and caverns beneath them, which connected to the surface via deep fissures and crevasses. These could be up to hundreds of feet (dozens of meters) deep and up to 60 feet (18 meters) wide, and could became treacherously concealed by the snow.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The mountains formed a southward-angled "V" shape with Mount Akka at the southernmost point. They sat due north of Vaasa beyond the Lugsaas Chain .</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , the Great Glacier had continued its centuries-long retreat northward, and the Surykyks sat on its southern boundary with the newly founded giant kingdom of Kultaakarr along its southern slopes.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>The Surykyk Range held popular nesting grounds for kupuk , especially in the south. The mountains' tunnels, caverns, and valleys provided excellent shelter to build their nests and raise their pups, as well as multiple routes to flee or hide from predators, such as the tirichiks that also haunted the caverns and crevasses.</p>
