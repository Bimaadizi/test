<p>Howling wolf charms were small enchanted trinkets created by the Reghedmen shamans of the Tribe of the Wolf .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These magic charms were small pieces of silver , fashioned in semblance of a wolf 's head.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>To activate an howling wolf charm , one must grip it hard and howl into the sky. This summoned a gray wolf under the command of the charm's owner. It was believed that they had limited power. With time and use, they became tarnished and eventually turned into silver powder once the last wolf was summoned. The strength of summoned wolves was similar to that of creatures summoned via the summon creature III spell.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , one of these charms belonged to Guthewulfe Henghelm , a boisterous traveling trader of the Tribe of the Wolf who visited the town of Targos before returning back home with new goods. Guthewulfe was eager to bet the trinket in a braehg drinking competition. Circa the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , an amulet version of the charm was a part of the curio collection of Mintassan the Magnificent, a planeswalker from Westgate .</p>
