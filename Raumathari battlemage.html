<p>Raumathari battlemages were the elite war-minded spellcasters of ancient Raumathar , an empire that rose and fell over a millennium before the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>These battlemages considered themselves to be the enemies of ancient Narfell and the demonic forces with which they cavorted.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>All battlemages were required to attune themself to a single sword , using it as a focus rather than some other implement. This ritual took three days to perform, and required material components upwards of 1,000 gp in value.</p>
<p>This extra effort was rewarded with a unique power. Raumathari battlemages could in effect channel certain memorized spells through their sword as they struck down foes in battle. A creature struck by the weapon was also struck by the effects of the channeled spell, so long as they did not resist the effects.</p>
<p>They could also apply metamagic effects to their spells at a rapid pace, without extending the duration of a spell's casting time.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the final conflict between Raumathar and Narfell, the battlemages led the efforts to destroy the Narfelli capital of Val-Murthag .</p>
<p>There were few practitioners of Raumathari battlemagic in the millennia following the collapse of the great eastern empire.</p>
