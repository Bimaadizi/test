<p>The Moonsea Ride , also called the Mountain Ride in Cormyr , was a road that ran north-east from Arabel until it reached Hillsfar on the southern shores of the Moonsea .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>From Arabel, it ran past Castle Crag and through Gnoll Pass in the Storm Horns . Forces from Castle Crag patrolled the road until Gnollpost , an outpost at the midpoint of Gnoll Pass. From there, it was patrolled by the garrison of Halfhap till Mootpost , which lay halfway to Tilverton.</p>
<p>At Tilverton, it intersected with the North Ride before passing over Tilver's Gap into Mistledale . It then met with Rauthauvyr's Road and the Standing Stone before leaving the Dalelands behind and cutting through the Rimwood and Midwood of Cormanthor . After emerging from the forest, it carried along till it met Hillsfar at the shore of the Moonsea .</p>
<p>The Stonebolt Trail split from the Moonsea Ride in Gnoll Pass and ran north through the Stonelands , bypassing Halfhap and Tilverton as it met the North Ride at Shadow Gap .</p>
