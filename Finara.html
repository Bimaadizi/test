<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before the Spellplague, Finara had been a mage, living in a tower; she proved unable to grasp the new make of spells after the Spellplague. Determined to regain her magic or die trying, she headed for Ormpetarr, looking to acquire a spellscar of her own. There, she joined Hadyn and Raidon Kane at some point in 1396 DR in a trip into the Spellscarred Land, where she brought her burro.</p>
<p>They followed the Pilgrim's Path across the Granite Vortex , deciding to cross the bridge that led through it. When Hadyn was slain by the spellscarred land, she decided not to finish the trip, and went back with her burro; only Raidon Kane persevered. By 1479 DR , she had made it back to Ormpetarr, where she opened an inn, Finara's.</p>
