<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 1490s DR , the bard Edgin Darvis sung "Juice of the Vine" to rouse his fellow prisoners while cutting ice at Revel's End prison, though the guard Tobias ordered him to shut up. He also sung it to cheer up his companion Holga Kilgore after they departed her ex-husband Marlamin at Longsaddle . He thought it was one of Holga's favorites.</p>
