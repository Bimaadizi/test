The unlucky Bruno Indomicus found himself indentured to Captain Grisly and Bosun Gannet of the Blushing Mermaid as well as to Brinks, loosing coin in Baldur's Bones . Brinks demanded Bosun Gannet chop Bruno's finger off as a warning, but the innkeeper turned the request down, offering instead to buy the dwarf's debt out.</p>
