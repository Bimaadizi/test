<p>Amah was a city-state of the Free Cities of the Vilhon Reach that maintained neutrality between Turmish and Chondath . Along with the cities of Nleeth , and Reth , they were sometimes referred to as the Southsands Games.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Amah was settled in Year of the Bright Plumage, 320 DR , originally to be used as a neutral training center for mock-battles Turmish and Chondath. The cities of Nleeth and Reth, served the same function, one alien with Turmish, wile the other - with Chondath. Both were established the same year. After the mining town of Aelor exhausted its gold production, it lost its population to the neighboring city of Amah.</p>
<p>In 1358 DR , the Mayor of Amah at the time - Pachipol , participated in a meeting of leaders of both Chondath and Turmish to discuss the menace of the arcanaloth Yrkhetep .</p>
<p>As of 1370 DR , Amah and Nleeth were still used as training centers for outside armies, however bloodshed of the towns' past was abandoned. The visiting armies of Turmish and Chondath clashed in competitions of combat mettle and tactics. The neighboring Hlondeth had no interest in expansion, to the city-state of Amah was left to its autonomy. Dediana Extaminos , the yuan-ti ruler of Hlondeth, was focused on effective rulership of her domain, however if possibility to take over Amah or other neighboring city-states arose, she was willing to consider expansion.</p>
