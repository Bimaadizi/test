<p>Frying pans of perfection were enchanted cooking implements that were used to produce meals of the finest quality.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A frying pan of perfection possessed an enchantment that allowed the pan to prepare one excellent meal for one once per day, granted the owner had a fire going on which the pan could rest. No food needed to be placed within the pan as the meal was fully produced through magical means. Each meal created through the pan's magic was excellent in taste and quality. If the pan's owner wanted to make more than one meal per day, they had to rely on their own skills and ingredients until the following day.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the midâ€“14 th century DR, a frying pan of perfection belonged to a group of people drained dry by a gang of vampires , and soon after, to Lord and Lady Diamond and their servant Jeeves . The pan was left unattended, filled with freshly created eggs and bacon after the trio's murder.</p>
