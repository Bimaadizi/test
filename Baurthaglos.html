<p>Baurthaglos , more commonly known as Anglaspark , was a blue dragon son of the blue wyrm ruler of Turmish , Anaglathos .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Anglaspark was an adult dragon who inhabited the secluded and untamed Orsraun Mountains . The blue dragon shared the region with only one other known dragonâ€”a red wyrm named Emberspeak . Anglaspark was a spawn of the infamous blue dragon Anaglathos, who claimed rulership of Turmish in the Year of the Yellow Rose, 1242 DR . Even though Baurthaglos's activities in the late 14 th century DR were limited to devouring fat Turmite cattle and occasional raids on the city of Orbrekh , some sages theorized that he might be harboring a grudge over Anaglathos's death or even schemed a takeover of Turmish. However, neither of these two suppositions had any evidence to support them.</p>
