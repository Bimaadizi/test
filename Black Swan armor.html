<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The armor possessed a strong +2 defensive enchantment and offered resistance against fire, ice, electricity, and acid. Additionally, the armor's beauty effortlessly boosted the wearer's charisma.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Black Swan armor was created in the heyday of the Hand of the Seldarine and Dorn's Deep 's era of cooperation. The metal shell was forged by the renowned dwarven smith Karador and its enchantments were woven by Elameth of Five Trees, who was the author of Elameth's Compendium of enchantments. The armor was created for a female elven marshal and so, after the citadel's fall, it was not looted by orc marauders. Sometime in or shortly before the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , the Black Swan was stolen from the ruins by Maiden Ilmadia , a renegade elf devotee of Revered Brother Poquelin . She was wearing the armor when she was defeated by the Heroes of Icewind Dale.</p>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Black Swan armor ended up in the hands of the shady drow merchant Nym . It was available for purchase from his camp outside Bryn Shander 's wall.</p>
