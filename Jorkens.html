<p>Jorkens was a jealous sailor and a mate aboard the Lustrous Lass in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Dizby was a human male with a clean-shaven head.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Captain Harfang passed Jorkens with a promotion, giving the quartermaster's position to Old Dizby , a doom-sayer and a fool in Jorkens's eyes. Vindictively, Jorkens slipped out from the Lustrous Lass while anchored at the Crone Island , where Harfang made a deal with the Gloom Crone , and made a deal of his own. Jorkens smugly praised his smarts, but it was never wise to deal with hags . Captain Harfang was granted "enough gold to last the rest of her life," but soon enough, the Captain realized that the bag of gold contained only six real gold pieces among the dross. As soon as she tossed the false gold aboard, Harfang came down with deadly sea plague that ended the lives of the entire crew in a bit over a tenday after the deal was made.</p>
<p>The bodies of the dead, including Jorkens', were left aboard the Lustrous Lass and quarantined after she drifted into the harbors of Baldur's Gate .</p>
