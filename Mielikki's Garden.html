<p>Mielikki's Garden was the forest on the eastern side of Ilighôn , an island off the coast of the Vilhon Reach .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mielikki's Garden was a thick oak forest on the island's eastern side. It was bordered by the Elder River to the west and Hierophant trail to the south. A large treant gathering, the "village" of Archentree , stood in Mielikki's Garden on the eastern shores of the Elder River. Sages debated whether it was treants who seeded the forest with its abundant oaks or if it were the oaks that attracted the treants. Another settlement in Mielikki's Garden was the island's port city, Sapra , nestled on the border with the Great Forest at the base of the Hierophant trail.</p>
<p>Squirrels were among the forest's inhabitants.</p>
