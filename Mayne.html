<p>Elder Mayne was the mayor of Highcliff on the Sword Coast North in the 1370s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Elder Mayne was the mayor of Highcliff when the lizardmen attacked the boats. He tasked the Kalach-Cha to resolve the situation. The Kalach-Cha could've defeated the lizard tribe (when Slaan leads the Kalach-Cha to the cave they inhabit), or persuade the tribe to stop the attacks and join Highcliff.</p>
<p>If the tribe was persuaded to join Highcliff, after the King of Shadows began his attack, the lizardmen occupied the town. Mayne asked of Kalach-Cha to save the village, to speak with the lizardmen's shaman.</p>
