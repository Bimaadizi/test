<p>An air elemental (sometimes called a wind elemental ) was a being made up of wind and living air . It appeared as a shapeless cloud that moved rapidly in any direction, even against the wind.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When summoned to the Prime Material plane , air elementals typically appeared as an amorphous, ever-shifting cloud. Whenever they made the rare attempt to speak, it resembled either the high-pitched shriek of a tornado or the low rumbling moan of a thunder storm.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Air elementals were capable of altering their bodies in the form of a small whirlwind. Over the ages, the height and diameters of these whirlwinds varied significantly, especially depending upon how powerful an air elemental was. Some were reported to be as small as 8‒16 ft (2.4‒4.9 m) tall, while others were reported being as tall as 40‒80 ft (12‒24 m) tall.</p>
<p>Free-willed air elementals dwelling on desolate moons in wildspace , known as moon devils , contained swirling dust and frost and had cold attacks.</p>
<p>Though they all roughly shared the same abilities, those in the Elemental Plane of Air that were incapable of being summoned were known to possess even greater powers.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Air elementals typically fought creatures by either blasting them with strong gusts of wind or shifting into their whirlwind form.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Diets</h3>
<p>Air elementals subsisted solely on the consumption of air.</p>
<h3>Summoning</h3>
<p>These elementals could be summoned to the Prime Material plane through use of the spells conjure elemental , conjure air elemental . conjure lesser air elemental , elemental servant , elemental summoning , summon monster III , and summon monster VI .</p>
<p>There were also magical items that could achieve this, such as a censer of controlling air elementals , a censer for summoning hostile air elementals , elemental gems , the Elemental Scourge in Kossuth's House , the Zakharan instrument nay of the djinn (but only if played by a bard or rawunin ), and the Tome of Twelve Seals .</p>
<p>In terms of divine magic , the specialty priests known as airwalkers were granted the power to summon an air elemental once per day or incredibly powerful ones once per tenday by their deity Akadi . Upon reaching a certain level of skill, airwalkers summoned their first air elemental in a religious ceremony called the Fellowship of Flight .</p>
<p>Halcyons , specialty priests of Aerdrie Faenya , had access to the conjure air elemental spell and the most powerful among their ranks were granted an innate ability to conjure forth an air elemental once per tenday for a period of one hour. Aerdrians notably considered these elementals to not be servants of the priest who summoned them, but rather of Aerdrie Faenya herself and thus were to be respected.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Aerial servants often tried to accompany them wherever they went, but air elementals strove to avoid them. They viewed the aerials as an inferior form of air elemental and discouraged other kinds of air elementals from interacting with them.</p>
<p>The warping magic of lunar dragon lairs produced moon devils in the region, which would dissipate if the dragon died.</p>
