<p>The Cormyr Stairs was one of three major pedestrian stairs that connected the Lower City and the Old Town in the Cormyrean city of Tilverton .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Cormyr Stairs were the stairs in the western side of town, just by the city gate that led towards wider Cormyr and the Gnoll Pass . The stair climb was the only way into the wealthier and less crowded Old Town apart from passing the Upper City Gate on the southernmost side of Tilverton. Directly to the stair's south stood the ruined Tilver's Palace . Halfway up the Cormyr Stairs stood the landing with the Helm 's shrine â€“ the Altar of Shields .</p>
