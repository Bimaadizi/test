<p>Adarbrent ( pronounced : / ɑː ˈ d ɑːr b r ɛ n t / ah-DAR-brent ) was a noble family that lived in Waterdeep during the 14 th century DR . They were among the leading shipping clans as of 1372 DR , possessing the city's third-largest fleet and holding strong ties with the Master Mariners' Guild .</p>
<p>Their headquarters was the Horizon Sails building within the Dock Ward .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>As of 1368 DR , the patriarch of the Adarbrent family was Lord Royus Adarbrent , with no acting consort. Alroy Adarbrent was Royus' eldest son and designated heir. In 1372 DR there were eighty-six living members of the Adarbrent noble family.</p>
<p>The majority of human family members were of Chondathan ethnicity.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The family were founding members of Horizon Armada , a league of ship-owners among the city's nobility that managed the sea lanes, coordinated their various fleets, and commissioned maritime maps.</p>
<p>In the 1300s DR, the Adarbrent noble family of Waterdeep had pact a pact with the verdant prince known as King Witchthorn in Kryptgarden Forest . For decades the family sent its firstborn child of each generation to pledge an oath to Witchthorn. The children performed an unknown service to the king by their eleventh year and in exchange the family businesses and their homes were protected by secret fey guardians. This arrangement was unknown to all but the eldest son and daughter of each generation. The Adarbrents profited greatly from the arrangement and Witchthorn asked nothing in exchange, so they saw the mysterious fey as a paternal benefactor, heedless of whatever long-term plans he might have and the risk of binding each new generation to them.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The family owned a villa in the North Ward , on the east side of Shield Street between Julthoon Street and Manycats Alley .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The family traveled from Cormyr to Waterdeep in the Year of Storms, 1310 DR to seek further wealth and prosperity with the Adarbrent Shipping Company . Finding immediate success, they quickly improved their station in life, joining Waterdeep's nobility in 1317 DR .</p>
<p>Lady Adarbrent gave birth to her third son, Ellis in 1344 DR . Some time later she passed away. Lord Royus never stopped mourning her death.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1372 DR , the impulsive and adventurous Syllia eloped to New Waterdeep with her lover, and fellow Harper, Farid al-Nisr . Lord Royus and her brothers didn't respond well to the news.</p>
<p>While some of Royus's brothers in House Adarbrent became rich from the cross-sea trade with New Waterdeep on the continent of Maztica , the Deepwater War left the family financially unsure. Following these developments, Lord Royus began to explore borrowing gold, at a very low interest rate, from Fahd yn Sarsor al-Nisr , Syllia's father-in-law. Unbeknownst to anyone in House Adarbrent, the senior Al-Nisr was Yrshelem within the Rundeen , who sought to takeover the financial holdings of the Waterdhavian family.</p>
