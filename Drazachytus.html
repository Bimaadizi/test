<p>Drazachytus was a fearsome red dragon of ill repute who laired in the Graypeak Mountains of the Savage Frontier some years before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Drazachytus' renown came with the red wyrm's death. The ambitious adventuring mage named Visdun Fardara sought to gain renown through heroics. After a series of failures, he spent most of his money to purchase a powerful wand of disintegration in the City of Splendors, Waterdeep , and traveled to Drazachytus's lair in the Graypeaks. With a single use of the wand , Visdun turned great Drazachytus into a pile of sand. The adventuring wizard collected Drazachytus' ashes to use it as proof of his heroic deed. Visdun Fardara was praised as a hero for an entire week until Drazachytus's ashes were stolen from Visdun's strongbox by a rival wizard who wanted to use the remnants of the great red dragon to conduct magical experiments.</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the ashes of Drazachytus were in possessions of planeswalker Mintassan , displayed in his curio shop in Westgate 's Market Triangle .</p>
