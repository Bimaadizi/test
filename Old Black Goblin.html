<p>Old Black Goblin was an expensive and exclusive type of porter served in clubs of Cormyr and Sembia .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This black-colored porter was brewed with cherrywood ash licorice root. Kegs of Old Black Goblin were branded with a "hunched-black-stick-figure" image.</p>
<p>This drink was an extremely rare commodity, found only in the most exclusive clubs for the rich and noble. Old Black Goblin's production was shrouded in secrecy. Its several well-hidden breweries were located somewhere in the backcountry of Interior Faer√ªn , and the recipe itself was rumored to be kept under lock and key by a noble house. The noble family's name was a secret as well, with only one clue being them growing wealthy in the late 14 th century DR through sales of Old Black Goblin.</p>
