<p>Xakamt was a beholder which died and then arose as a strange doomsphere wreathed in fire. It was bound to serve the will of Mythalanir , the Eternal Flame of the Flaming Brazier temple in Bezantur during the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Xakamt was best described as a weird hybrid between a ghost and a blazing bones .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>It acted only as an enthralled servant and protector of Mythalanir. Xakamt would remain hidden nearby its master and leap into combat if he was injured, sweeping its antimagic gaze over Mythalanir's enemies.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Xakamt invaded the Flaming Brazier in the Year of the Helm, 1362 DR , seeking to steal a rumored trove of magic items . Empowered with contingency spells to prevent its death, Xakamt entered the temple but was slain when embraced by a fire elemental . The simultaneous burning, activation of the contingency , as well as firing of Xakamt's disintegration ray caused the beholder to transform into a flaming spectral undead creature. Presumably as a punishment from Kossuth , Xakamt found itself irrevocably forced to follow the orders of Mythalanir, the high priest of the temple, who had the beholder act as his bodyguard.</p>
<p>Mythalanir would go to great lengths to keep Xakamt's existence a secret in order to make it a more effective guardian, and as of 1370 DR , he was largely successful. Only a few individuals had discovered Xakamt and lived to tell the tale, and when a conspiracy was hatched to murder Mythalanir by Klanak Famouth and Mythrell'aa , these conspirators had no idea of the beholder's existence.</p>
