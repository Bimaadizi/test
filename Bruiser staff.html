<p>Bruiser staves were enchanted staves of powerful physical might.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bruiser staves were simple-looking wooden masterwork quarterstaves from 6 feet (1.8 meters) to 9 feet (2.7 meters) long. They were sometimes carved out of stout oak .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Bruiser staves possessed a +5 enchantment that effortlessly guided the wielder's weapon towards their targets and could damage even creatures who usually were unaffected by weapons of lesser enchantments. This magic, however, granted a limited boost to the staff's damage output. Despite that, the bruising enchantment wounded each successful strike's targets, causing bleeding. It also had a chance of stunning the targets.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , a bruiser staff belonged to the Archmage of the Underdark city of Rilauven , Malavon Despana , who operated from the caverns underneath the Spine of the World .</p>
