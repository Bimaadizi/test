<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , during the Absolute crisis , Farlin led a gang of Guild members in dealing with the Stone Lord and his men. The new kingpin secretly served the Absolute and was trying to remove the Guild's influence from across the Gate. Farlin's group faced a band of the Stone Lord's men led by Cairos, who served as Stone Lord's envoy. In his foul attitude and arrogance, Funglesby would not believe that Minsc of Rashemen was Stone Lord even if he confronted the tiefling directly. The groups clashed under the Wyrm's Crossing bridge in Rivington over a shipment of supplies. However, the meeting devolved into a battle and either of squads's fate remained uncertain.</p>
