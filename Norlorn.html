<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was a wispy white shadow, trailing off into smoke below the waist.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Noldorn had grown rather aggressive about protecting the Vale. He showed concern that his fellow, Elaethan , was becoming more like the men by scrying on their minds.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He was largely unaffected by spells that destroyed undead, or even chain lightning . Amongst other things, Noldorn could create barriers of force, almost certainly through wall of force , and he could unmake mage-killer creatures.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He was a guardian of the Sacred Vale .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>One of his fellow guardians was named Elaethan.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 241Â DR , Noldorn arrived at the scene after Elminster Aumar escaped Heldebran ; he mistook Elminster for an elf, due to him being transformed and wearing a kiira . He ultimately left Heldebran at the mercy of his own mage-killer , slaying him and then the mage-killer itself. Later he'd remark that Elaethan was thinking too much like a human.</p>
