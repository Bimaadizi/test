<p>Arc welders were prototype dwarven tools intended for welding metal using electricity, but in the hands of an artificer they functioned similarly to Eberronian rune arms . Several of these novel devices could be found in the dwarven city of Tethyamar on Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Arc welders consisted of a main device and separate power-supply materials that connected to a slot on the back. Many safety precautions were recommended when operating arc welders, including but not limited to avoiding looking directly into the aperture, not pointing the welder at non-metal apparatuses while powered, keeping the device out of water, not attempting to disassemble the device or power-supply materials, and wearing safety goggles when operating the welder.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Depending on if it was a short- or long-range variant, arc welders could either discharge a wide field or a single long beam of electricity, with the power building up over time. In addition, in the hands of an artificer the device passively increased the potency of their electricity-based spells and made their other weapons more deadly, including electrifying them. It also made it easier to stun, trip, and pierce the armor of an opponent.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prototype arc welders were found in and around the mines of Tethyamar in the Year of the Rune Lords Triumphant, 1487 DR , during Hal Stoutheart 's expedition to the mines of Tethyamar. A long-range welder could be found in Mineshaft 214S with the mad dwarf Egil Hakon , while a short-range welder was in the possession of the drider slaver Phy'xzar at a drow camp.</p>
