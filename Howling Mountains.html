<p>The Howling Mountains were a vast range of mountains located in northern Laerakond . The nations of Fimbrul and Relmaur were located within its mountains. Most of the forbidden primordial cults of Laerakond operated out in the Howling Mountains.</p>
<h2>Geographical features</h2>
<p>The Howling Mountain range was a wasteland region composed of snow capped mountains, deep chasms and hidden valleys ravaged by terrible blizzards and storms that prevent even dragons to fly in winter, or giant fog clouds capable to block all vision and distort sounds in summer. The mountains were so vast and maze-like that even primordials could hide in its ranges without fear of being spotted. The hidden high valleys within the mountains were full of oni and their orcs servants, as well as game such as boar and elk .</p>
<p>Below the Howling Mountains mighty peaks were located giant cavern networks full of meltwater rivers and lakes where most living things in Fimbrul and Relmaur dwelt. Its caverns hold the richest known veins of raw metal ores and gemstones in all of Abeir , and later, in all of Toril as well.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the War of Fang and Talon , most of the surviving primordials of Abeir went to the Howling Mountains to hide from the wrath of their dragon steeds, and eventually entered into a coma-like sleep.</p>
