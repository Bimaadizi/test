<p>The Grand Hoist was an unfinished lift designed to ferry goods back and forth between Waterdeep and Skullport . The hoist was designed to bypass the dangers of Undermountain and the Lapel Sea .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The grand scheme was conceived by a former leader of the Mandible gang. Two teams began digging the shaft, one under Waterdeep and the second in Skullport. The project was a series of disasters that bankrupted most of its investors. As of 1479 DR , the Mandibles continued work on the project although at a reduced pace.</p>
