<p>Tarhun Mnemonis was a butler in the employ at Lady Jannath's Estate in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tarhun was a dragonborn man with pale tan hide and fiery red eyes. He wore an attendant's finery and wore a fanciful top hat.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Tarhun Mnemonis and Chamberlain Mercer were two of the most trusted servants of Lady Firelia Jannath of Baldur's Gate. When the Lady's estate became haunted by Firelia's new husband's ex lover, all of the estate's servants were dismissed, including Bailey , Furbleston , Cyrilla , Jooli , Phubbs , and Chef Marjoram . All but Tarhun were placed on temporary leave with the pay of half-wages and allowance to seek temporary employment elsewhere. Butler Mnemonis, however, remained positioned at the estate's doors, turning away guests, collecting the wedding gifts and best wishes on Lady Jannath's behalf, and ensuring everyone that she was spending time with her new husband and nothing else. Tarhun's loyalty prevented him from informing anyone of the true reasoning for the Lady not accepting guests. For the same reason, he would let some eager adventurers in who were insistent on investigating the strange happenings, calming that he was on holiday, like the rest of the staff.</p>
