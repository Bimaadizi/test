<p>Immersea was a medium-sized town in the Immer Stream Valley of Cormyr . It was the ancestral home of the Wyvernspur family .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As of the late 14 th century DR , Immersea was a settlement of around 100 buildings and several manors that lacked any fortifications. The town was surrounded by a mosaic of green and gold farm fields. Most things in Immersea were of various shades of brown: buildings, roads, mud-caked children, even horses and oxen . The cobblestone streets of the town were lit with lanterns hung atop tall poles at night.</p>
<p>Near the center of the town was a statue of a mounted King Azoun III fighting a group of bandits known as Azoun Triumphant , adjacent to the town's Market . The biggest and grandest point of interest was the Redstone Castle , the ancestral home of the Wyvernspur family.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Immersea stood on the Calantar's Way and was most commonly used as a stop-over for travelers who ventured to and from Arabel and Hilp . The settlement was perched on the westernmost edge of the Wyvernflow freshwater lake on Mistfisher Bay , also known as Immer Bay, where the Immer Stream joined the lake. Immer Stream began on the lush Spring Hill just west of Redstone Caste and cascaded off the hill forming the beautiful Selûne's Stairs . The town was connect to the city of Arabel and the sleepy village of Hilp to the north via Calantar's Way, the city of Dhedluk thorough Starwater Road to the west, Hilp to the north, and Wheloon through Blister Trail to the east.</p>
<p>Immersea was known for its storms. The reputation birthed a Cormyrean saying, "scowling like an Immersea storm." Mists are very common, and much of the land was covered in flowering vines.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Rulership of the town laid in the hands of the Lord of Immersea appointed by the Crown of Cormyr. Lord Mensel of Cormyr was a Lord of Immersea more than a century before 1312 DR . He was generally beloved for his kindness and humanitarianism. In the 14 th century DR, Samtavan Sudacar of the noble House Sudacar was the ruler of the town. He was beloved by his subjects but disliked by Suzail for his exceedingly poor leadership. During his rule, the true governorship was in the hands of herald Geldroon Cultspiir who did his best to keep Immersea running. By 1367 DR , Lord Samtavan Sudacar was close to retirement and paid little attention to running his town. Despite all that, Immersea remained one of the very few Cormyrean cities that openly voices their dissatisfaction with the Crown. During Samtavan's reign, the town's laws were quite lax, trade was unrestricted, and weapons were allowed to be carried in the open, unbound by peace-strings. Most garrison, guard, street-cleaners, and other maintenance was financed by Immersean nobility and merchant families, namely the Wyvernspurs, Cormaerils, Thunderswords , and others.</p>
<p>Before Samtavan Sudacar, the Lord of Immersea was Wohl Wyvernspur of the local noble House Wyvernspur until his death circa 1350 DR . As Wohl's son was a child, the rulership was assigned to Lord Sudacar, who was graciously invited by the Wyvernspurs to share the family home.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Apart from mostly human inhabitants, Immersea head a large population of various livestock beasts . For humanoids, Immersea offered numerous tiny inns, taverns, and stores, many of which catered to passers-by and single-night customers. A dark beer called Elminster's Choice was a famous libation made and exported from Immersea and beloved by adventurers across the Wyvernwater, much to Elminster Aumar 's chagrin. Most shops in the settlement were tailored to the needs and wants of travellers and caravans. Numerous weavers, net-makers, cordwainers, coopers, crate-makers, and hardware merchants could be found in Immersea.</p>
<p>Immersea farms raised cattle, sheep , and grew barley as well as corn . Apart from farming, Immersea produced fish, with the local group of fishers, known as the "Mist Fishers", being a popular attraction. The "Mist Fishers" embarked on their fishing journey in the early mist-filled mornings across the Wyvernwater. At the end of the day, fishers returned to harbor bearing a rich catch from their drag-lines and scoop-nets. Sunsets and sunrises on the lake were especially spectacular and helped the "Mist Fishers'" popularity. Freshwater eels , silverfin , trout , crabs , and greenbacks were among the most abundant catch. By the late 15 th century DR, the fishing industry in Immersea began to suffer, possibly due to over-fishing. This led to fishers down on their luck, turning to other profit methods. One family of note, the Ghelks , opened a successful crab hatchery in a warehouse building south of the docks.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, the town expanded along both sides of the Mistfisher Bay , slightly to the west, as well as along the Calantar's Way. The town opened numerous potteries, weaver shops, and printing houses.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Immersea maintained a humble garrison that included militia members only. Like everywhere in Cormyr, Immersea had Purple Dragons stationed in the town. However, they were never seen in uniform while on duty.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , just a month before the Time of Troubles struck Faerûn , a band of adventurers from Immersea, the Company of the Lynx under the command of Knorrel Talbot recruited a young and talented wizard named Midnight . The heroes had recently slain a great wyrm on the Wyvernwater after the creature swallowed a diplomatic envoy from Anauroch .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Dragon, 1352 DR , Immersea, along with other cities on the Wyvernwater, Hultail , Thunderstone , and Wheloon , were captured by the would-be king and rebellion leader Gondegal , also known as the Lost King. However, his reign was ended abruptly, and Gondegal himself disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>In late Ches of the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , a halfling " bard " and Harper , Olive Ruskettle , became involved with the plot to steal the heirloom of House Wyvernspur – the titular Wyvern's Spur . Along with Giogioni Wyvernspur and Cat , Olive faced off with the undead minions and the flying fortress of Flattery Wyvernspur , a first attempt to create a sentient construct by Finder Wyvernspur . The flying fortress was the size of Immersea and loomed over the town as the heroes battled for the life of the newborn Amber Leona Wyvernspur . The battle culminated with a fierce aerial battle between Flattery, who took on a shape of a blue dragon , and Giogi, who transformed into a huge red wyvern using the magic of the Spur. The Wyvernspurs successfully stopped Flattery, and the conflict led to Giogioni taking the role of the patriarch of his noble house.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, Immersea continued to grow and prosper. The town's population passed 4,000 souls in winter and reached 4,800 in summer, thanks to nobility from Arabel and Suzail, who owned summer residences in Immersea or rented homes for the season overlooking the beautiful Wyvernwater. House Wyvernspur remained the most powerful and prosperous noble hose in Immersea. Among non-noble wealthy families of the town were the Beldrar , Coldreth , Fostren , Ghelk , Sagrask , Tranther , and a hin family of Perinpost , who rose to prominence.</p>
