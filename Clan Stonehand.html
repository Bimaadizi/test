<p>Clan Stonehand was a family of dwarves that lived in the town of Daggerford circa the midâ€“14 th century DR . They were skilled masons that had lived there for generations prior to the Era of Upheaval .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Many of the clan's members fought during the Second Dragonspear War of 1363 DR .</p>
<p>Sometime before 1372 DR , the clan was led by Kurgin Stonehand . During his reign, the clan owned a mine not far from the swamp home of an old black dragon Zarkursk . Eventually, the Stonehand warriors defeated the wyrm and inherited its horde of gemstones . This suddenly made all the young members of the clan highly desirable bachelors, especially among the women of the Clan Licehair . To battle with these unwanted advances, Kurgin Stonehand commissioned creations of so-called dwarven belt of charming . These magic items were enchanted to plummet the wearer's appeal and charisma to levels well below the dwarven standards.</p>
