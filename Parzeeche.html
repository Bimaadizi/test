<p>Parzeeche was a general goods and supplies merchant from the town of Port Llast circa 1374 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Parzeeche appeared friendly and eager to wave people towards his stall; however, he could not hide his sleaze.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Parzeeche could be found in the market of Port Llast where he recited not-very-well-rehearsed self-appraising sales pitches for his goods. He often forgot the script and complained that he should've written it down. Parzeeche's business was doing well enough during the time Port Llast was taken over by the neighboring northern city of Luskan .</p>
