<p>The molten orbs were a set of metal spheres that were crafted and enchanted by Coriolis Rillevay for use in battle. It could be found in Waterdeep as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The central and largest orb had a fiery core that glowed through cracks in the surface, while two smaller and solid orbs orbited around it. The entire constellation of the molten orbs , in turn, would either float above the wielder's head or orbit around them from beyond arm's reach.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The molten orbs could be directed to launch an injurious beam of fire at a target, and seemingly at random, it might choose to also fire additional beams at other targets as well.</p>
