<p>Viconia's Walking Fortress was a unique and powerfully enchanted tower shield used by Mother Superior Viconia De Vir of the Cloister of Sombre Embrace in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This ornate shield's name was derived from the defensive "Walking Fortress" battle technique that aimed to annoy one's opponent by not allowing it to land a single blow.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Viconia's Walking Fortress possessed a potent defensive +3 enchantment. The wielder of the shield could use its weight and strength to return the attacker's force back at them in a powerful burst of concussive force that had a chance of knocking the opponent prone. Once per hour or a period of short rest and recharge, Viconia's Walking Fortress could surround its wielder in a reflective shell that reflected all missiles that were fired at the wielder, back at their point of origin. Lastly, once per day, the wielder could activate the shield's warding bond enchantment that gave the wielder protection against spells and disadvantaged the attackers' physical, ranged, and magical assaults.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Viconia De Vir came to possess her unique tower shield sometime before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , when she was always seen carrying it whilst surrounded by the faithful of the Cloister of Sombre Embrace.</p>
