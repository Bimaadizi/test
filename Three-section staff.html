<p>Three-section staves , also known as three-piece rods , were a type of Kara-Turan martial arts melee weapon. Some considered it to be a member of the flail family of weapons, due to having similar origins.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A three-section staff was composed of three sections of hard wood that were of equal length, typically measuring around 2​ to ​3 feet (0.61​ to ​0.91 meters) in length. These sections were connected at their ends by either chain, leather, or rope .</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>A three-section staff required two hands to use. The weapon was considered useless in the hands of those who weren't properly trained in its use. They could be used to strike at an opponent, block their attacks, or to catch and break an opponent's weapon.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Much like how the threshing flail later developed into the flail, the three-section staff originally developed as an agricultural tool for threshing grain and over time became increasingly utilized as a weapon. Eventually, the kau sin ke and nunchaku were developed from them.</p>
