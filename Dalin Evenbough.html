<p>Dalin Evenbough was a halfling merchant aboard the Vigilant in 1374 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Merchant Evenbough was a fair-skinned slender hin with cautious personality. When pressed to defend himself, Dalin wielded a shortbow , staying away from the immediate danger of the front lines.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 1374 DR , Captain Lastri Kassireh and the Vigilant sailed from the Sword Coast to the nation of Samarach on the Chultan Peninsula . Onboard the ship were several passengers, including Dalin Evenbough and Volothamp Geddarm , who journeyed to meet with a wealthy yuan-ti trading company leader—Lady Sa'Sani . The voyage was cursed with bad luck and numerous strange occurrences: food supplies were mysteriously spoiled, freshwater barrels ruptured, one of the crew, Kellen , got drunk and drowned, Volo almost got poisoned, and new ropes became frayed. In reality, the ship was sabotaged. Dalin Evenbough was rightfully worried for his life aboard the ship.</p>
<p>While most of the crew's lives ended in a deadly storm, Dalin survived. The Vigilant's shipwreck was washed ashore not far from the city of Samargol , and Dalin, Volo, and several other passengers ended up defending themselves against flesh-hungry Batiri .</p>
