<p>Dransagalor was a black dragon . An acquaintance of Sammaster , the two of them met, alongside Cylla Morieth , in Uktar 9 of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Caught in the early stages of a Rage of Dragons , he attacked Sammaster together with Ormalagos ; after he calmed their frenzy, Sammaster warned them a frenzy without end was coming and offered them the transformation into a dracolich . Though Needle was skeptical, Dransagalor had portents in his dreams that the frenzy would be truly without end, and was thusly resigned to his fate as a dracolich.</p>
<p>He could cast the most elementary dismissal spell for most magical effects, likely dispel magic .</p>
