<p>Janesta Leafgrace was a wood elf and Natal Peacethorn 's friend.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On 1375Â DR , Jamesta was part of a group that studied standing stones which showed the path to a causeway . One day they found the mist between the stones dissipating and the path open for the first time. Entering, she and Natal Peacethorn saw the Gate of Stardeep . The day after, their encampment was attacked by Empyrean Knights . As she had gotten up early to examine a cougar 's tracks, she was not at the encampment, leaving her as the only survivor. During the attack, she saw Natal dragged out of his home.</p>
<p>She hid during the attack, and made it back to Relkath's Foot , where she told of the attack, with the aid of the Masters of the Yuirwood . Janesta identified the precise location of the Causeway Gate to Stardeep to all present.</p>
