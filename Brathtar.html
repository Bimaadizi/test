<h2>Activities</h2>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Until Telarian began his scheme to free the Traitor , they were friends.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around ten years before 1374 DR , Brathtar received Keeper Nangulis ' Cerulean Sign after the latter was transformed into a sword. He was to pass it to the next keeper of the Inner Bastion . The knight Telarian often joined him and the captains for dice games and white wine, which the commander imported from Sildëyuir at great cost. They once explored the Underdungeon beneath Stardeep, where Brathtar had saved Telarian's life from some revived fossils and then ordered the entrances closed.</p>
<p>On 1375 DR , after Midwinter , Brathtar received orders from Keeper Telarian to eliminate an elven encampment that had wandered too close to Stardeep 's entrance. Though he agreed to the task, he left a letter for Delphe , asking her to meet with him at her earliest opportunity. He eradicated the encampment, but one survivor escaped, and he lost their trail.</p>
<p>After they began receiving retaliation from the Masters of the Yuirwood , Brathtar was ordered by Telarian to hide all signs of fight; after he failed at that task, Telarian judged him a traitor. When Brathtar began to question Telarian's orders again, the Keeper slew him on the spot with Nis .</p>
