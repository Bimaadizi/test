<p>A disc of secrets was an un holy symbol of Shar that bore an illusion to conceal its appearance, allowing a Sharran cleric to hide their true allegiance.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The disc of secrets normally appeared to be a blank silver disc on an ordinary silver chain. Beneath this illusion was an unholy symbol of Shar , a black disc of jet within a ring of purple amethysts .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A shadow illusion was laid on the disc of secrets ; this was partially real and could not be disbelieved. The command phrase, "Reveal your secret to no one", ironically revealed its true appearance.</p>
<p>In all respects, a disc of secrets served as an unholy symbol of Shar in the hands of one of her clerics. The magic's only purpose was to conceal this fact.</p>
<p>Uniquely, a disc of secrets belonging to Shan Thar , a cleric of Cyric , bore a second illusion. Speaking the command word "lies" after the first command phrase caused the jawless white skull to appear within the black disc.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Fashioning a disc of secrets required knowledge of the shadow conjuration spell and a mastery of Shadow Weave magic .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Discs of secrets were employed by the clerics of Shar and Cyric behind the false Temple of Mystra in Wheloon and those involved in operations in the Vast Swamp , in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR .</p>
