<h2>History</h2>
<p>Icingdeath was killed by Drizzt Do'Urden and Wulfgar on Eleasis 26 in the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR , after Wulfgar threw his warhammer Aegis-fang into an icicle that fell and impaled the dragon in the heart. They slew Icingdeath so Wulfgar could fulfill the unfinished quest of his father Beornegar , and claim a trophy that would enable him to challenge the leader of his tribe to a duel. The dragon's horns served as this trophy.</p>
<p>Ingeloakastimizilian's nickname came to be attached to one of Drizzt Do'Urden's scimitars , Icingdeath , which he found in the dragon's hoard. The dragon's body and horde remained untouched well into the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , haunted by Ingeloakastimizilian in his ghost dragon form, guarding the horde from being looted.</p>
<p>Even a century after he was slain, Icingdeath's frozen corpse remained within his lair in Evermelt. It became a site of veneration by cultists of Auril led by Bjami Tengervaald , who worshiped them as a manifestation of their goddess. Eventually, the Ice Witch Hedrun Arnsfirth directed her simulacrum to animate Icingdeath's remains as an undead, skeletal dragon to fight off a band of adventurers within Evermelt.</p>
