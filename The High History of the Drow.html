<p>The High History of the Drow was a tome detailing major historical events involving the dark elves .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The history of the dark elves could only be generalised, due to the tendency of the drow to rewrite it.</p>
<p>The book was split into three main sections; in order, these were 'The Descent', 'The Dark Wars', and 'The Drow Today'. The first part detailed the "descent of the drow", where dark elves fled underground following a series of defeats against elves , dwarves , humans , and others. The second part documented how drow began to fight against dwarves and among themselves, leading to the collapse of Bhaerynden 's ceiling. The final section detailed how drow acted centuries later.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The tome was written by the sage known as Shahaerynus of Myth Drannor . In the 14 th century DR , it was studied by Elminster 's apprentice, Susprina Arkhenneld , who desired to write a sequel to the important historical document.</p>
