<p>Methild was the court bard of the ancient kingdom of Chilldion as well as the namesake, and possibly the creator, of Methild's harps , who lived long before the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The legend that told Methild's story stated that he was a bard who lived in a tiny valley kingdom called Chilldion far from other civilized realms . One winter night, a coven of three hags took over the valley after ensorcelling the royal family. The hags were planning on eating the family whilst they were immobilized by the foul holding magics. After a long day of conquest, spellcasting , and slaughtering of the innocent, the coven grew tired and ordered Methild, the court bard, to strum them a song. But the bard was loyal to his king and brought along his enchanted harp . He played the instrument and focused its magics on the king first, dissolving the holding spell and allowing the king to sneak away. Methild continued to play and remove magic from everyone restrained by the hags, one by one. When every victim was freed, Methild could play no longer, and the coven realized the treachery. The bard did not escape and became the hags' supper instead of the king's family.</p>
