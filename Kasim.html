<p>Kasim was the first and older wife of the Turmish merchant wizard Akabar Bel Akash , a friend and a companion of a hero named Alias . She also led the family business - the merchant company of House Akash circa 1357 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Kasim was a business-savvy serious woman who did not understand Akabar's adventure-lust, at least that was what the would-be adventuring wizard thought.</p>
<p>Kasim extremely disliked the smell of wet wool .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Traditionally, men and Akabar himself were little more than a face for their wives' enterprises. This made Kasim the leader of the trading company, her fellow wives handling other daily business tasks, like accounting, while Akabar was conducting the trade and accompanied the shipments to the clients.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Kasim was Akabar's first wife and main business partner. Their relationship, like the tradition dictated, was more of a business nature than love and affection, more common on the Sword Coast .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By 1357 DR, Kasim was mainly in charge of her family's trading business House Akash . The family organization traded in fine weaves and spices, and Akabar was traveling across the cities on Lake Dragonmere conducting business and raising funds for the new partner, new wife, to expand the merchant company, as per Turmish tradition.</p>
<p>By 1358 DR, the new wife joined the House Akash to expand the family business. Zhara , the new wife, was, in reality, one of the echoes of Akabar's friend and adventuring companion Alias.</p>
<p>Akabar, accompanied by his third wife Zhara traveled to Shadowdale , to address his recent prophetic nightmares of the god of rot Moander 's return in 1358. Unfortunately, that adventure was the last one for the wizard Turmishman, as he perished destroying the god, receiving the post-mortem status of a hero.</p>
