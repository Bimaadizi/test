<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wand of citrine force was a slender rod made of translucent yellow glass.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The wand of citrine force had two known modes of functioning. One of the modes of functioning cast a spell akin to ethereal chamber on the target it was pointed at, except that unlike the spell, the wand's function could function outside of the ethereal plane . Its second function was its ability to create obstacles; it could be used to block out portals, for instance, in this way. By touching the wand to its effects, those could be dispelled.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1373 DR , Ususi Manaallin held such a wand. It was almost spent; she used it five times during her quest to confront the Rotting Man , the first in order to block a portal, and the second time in order to encase the demon Eschar in a glassy case. While under the influence of the vampire Damanda , Ususi employed two charges to trap Elowen , her companion; she employed one last charge to distract the Rotting Man.</p>
