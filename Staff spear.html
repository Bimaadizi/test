<p>Staff spears were enchanted staves that transformed into piercing weapons upon command.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Staff spears appeared to be nothing but a mundane quarterstaff. Upon uttering a command word, these weapons manifested a sharp spear tip, turning it into a fully-functional polearm . These weapons radiated a slight aura of alteration magic and possessed a +2 enchantment that improved the wielder's aim and damage output. Its transudation magic made staff spears easily wielded by anyone who knew how to handle a simple staff.</p>
