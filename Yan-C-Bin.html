<p>Yan-C-Bin ( pronounced : / j ɑː n ˈ s i b ɪ n / yan-SEE-bin ), also known as the Prince of Evil Air , was a powerful archomental from the Elemental Plane of Air . He was referred to by a number of names and titles, including the Prince of Evil Aerial Creatures , the Shadow of the Four Winds , and the Howling Hatred</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Yan-C-Bin commonly appeared to his followers as a tall, thin, elderly humanoid with long hair flowing in the wind. His true form was akin to a tornado.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Yan-C-Bin was flighty and quick to react to things, but he was also a rational thinker with a desire for intellectual stimulation and a love of scholarly pursuits. It was said that all creatures in the sky of any plane feared Yan-C-Bin. But he also had a strong sense of honor and would generously reward those who helped him.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Many primordials considered Yan-C-Bin to be untrustworthy and avoided him.</p>
<p>Yan-C-Bin and those that served him had a strong dislike of the servants of Ogrémoch and the Prince of Evil Earth himself. But his greatest rival is the good Princess of Air, Chan , against whom he has been waging a secret war of information and sabotage.</p>
<p>He was worshiped by the Cult of the Howling Hatred , and their companion organization, the Feathergale Knights .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Dawn War , Yan-C-Bin learned of the existence of the Elder Elemental Eye and convinced other primordials, including Olhydra and Imix , to join forces and serve that power in the hopes that they would be able to conquer the world. Following the Dawn War, the gods sealed Yan-C-Bin inside a mobile palace made of solidified air.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Yan-C-Bin was summoned to the Throne of Blood on Gehenna by the mortal devotee of Bhaal , Amelyssan . The Prince of Evil Air was present during the battle between her and the Bhaalspawn Abdel Adrian .</p>
<p>During the 15 th century DR , circa the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR , Aerisi Kalinoth and the Cult of Howling Hatred sought to summon Yan-C-Bin to Faerûn in the Howling Caves around the ruins of Besilmer .</p>
