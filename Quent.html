<p>Quent was a caravan master in Aglarond during the late 14 th century DR.</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>Quent had black hair, and long years of experience were apparent on it.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was the master of the caravan which Raidon Kane signed up with as a guard in 1375Â DR . Per Raidon Kane, he was obviously a veteran of several trips, who ran a tight ship with good discipline. Quent boasted of a secret pass across the River Umber to reach Emmech faster.</p>
<p>Quent was, however, greedy and adventurous enough to try to make a shortcut across territory patrolled by Thay in order to circumvent a tax on the usual trade roads.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>He knew how to wield a bow.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He exchanged some barrels for boxes outside Phent on the first leg of their trip, heading directly for Emmech through a lesser-traveled route south the next day. One day later, they crossed a slender ravine in the Dragonjaw Mountains before making camp. With half a day's light left, Quent sent a scout forward. The scout returned with a Thayan patrol in pursuit; during the attack, Quent attacked them with his bow.</p>
<p>When he arrived at Emmech , he unloaded his wares, which comprised several kinds of fruit. He paid his crew quickly, and began making deals soon after.</p>
