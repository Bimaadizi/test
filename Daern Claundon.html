<p>Daern Claundon , also known as Orcbane , was a dwarven adventurer from the Sword Coast North who had risen to fame in the Heartlands as of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR for his hatred of orcs and his tireless pursuit of killing them.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Daern claimed to have discovered a lost dwarven city beneath the Mosstrunks , an area deep within the woods of the Elven Court of Cormanthor . He entreated the dwarven community of Tasseldale with tales of how well preserved the ruins were, but declined to share how he had found them in the first place. News of his discovery quickly spread as far as Mulmaster , and it became rumored that he had found great wealth, powerful artifacts, or both.</p>
