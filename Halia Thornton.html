<p>Halia Thornton was a Zhentarim agent and the original guildmaster of the Phandalin Miner's Exchange in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Thornton was a calculating agent with huge ambitions. She wished to further the Zhentarim cause by taking over Phandalin and adding it to their territory. Thornton wished to do this by slowly establishing her guild as the governing body of the village.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was a fierce but patient woman who was dangerous to cross. She had few qualms about helping those who seemed like valuable business partners, and equally few qualms about stabbing those same people in the back if it suited her (or even if they were simply rude to her).</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Thornton owned a house to the southeast of the Miner's Exchange.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She was not harassed by the Redbrands , the local outlaws, even though all the other businesses seemed to be. She desired to control the Redbrands to bring the town under her iron fist.</p>
<p>Halia was a dedicated agent of the Zhentarim. When she met adventurers whom she thought could be useful to the Zhentarim, she would invite them to join the Black Network or refer them to Urlam Stockspool in Triboar for work.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR , Halia wished to exploit adventurers that had come into town. She would tell them the location of the base of the Redbrands, and where they loitered, as well as offer them a reward for their leader 's head. Halia hoped that she could use this information and the reward as leverage to control the new adventurers into doing her bidding. This way, she could assume leadership of the Redbrands.</p>
<p>During an ongoing regional conflict between the Cult of Talos and a sect of Myrkul followers, Halia kept close tabs on both groups' spies operating in Phandalin, although she was not averse to working with them if the opportunity made sense.</p>
<p>Following the decision by Phandalin's townsfolk be governed by a Town Council instead of a Townmaster, Halia campaigned for and was successfully elected to a two-year term on the council, alongside retired soldier Sildar Hallwinter and the former Townmaster Harbin Wester .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Duplicitous Courtier, 1496 DR , Halia was killed by the sect of the Zhentarim loyal to the Manshoon in Waterdeep as a way to muscle in on Phandalin . She was replaced at the Miner's Exchange by the Zhentarim affiliate and Manshoon-loyalist Sharna Quirstiron , who convinced the town that Halia had left Phandalin because the mines were failing under her oversight. This disappearance of one of their town councilors led to another reorganization of Phandalin's political structure in which the remaining two councilors, Harbin and Sildar, vied for the new position of mayor.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Halia had come across information that the Redbrands had a goblin contact who knew the location of Cragmaw Castle .</p>
