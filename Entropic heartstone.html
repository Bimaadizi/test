<h2>History</h2>
<p>The gemstone was worked on by Graz'zt for an unknown scheme as he imbued it with his essence, until he one day tired of it. It was later found in the tunnels of Tethyamar by a drow slaver group led by Phy'xzar the drider . A bold warforged may have proceeded to use the gemstone as a docent, despite it appearing to be a terrible idea.</p>
