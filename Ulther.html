<p>King Ulther was a regent who lived, died, and became a ghost , long before 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ulther's reign was cut short when his nephew, the next in the line of succession, Prince Zherost , filled King's gold -plated plate mail with deadly contact poison . Ulther wore the poisoned armor to a knight tournament and passed the following day. However, his spirit did not depart the Prime Material plane . Instead, it became bound to the armor he died in, haunting it like other ghosts haunted homes and castles. Prince Zherost wore the same plate armor to his coronation, and as the ceremony went on, the ghost of King Ulther drove his nephew to panic. Before the coronation ceremony was completed, Zherost dashed out of the castle, striking in terror. As he fled, the Prince stumbled and plummeted into the castle's moat and drowned. It was said that both Zherost and Ulther were still bound to what became known as the Haunted Armor .</p>
<p>In 1372 DR, the Haunted Armor was located in Torleth's Treasures of Gillian's Hill , available for sale with not many brave or stupid buyers.</p>
