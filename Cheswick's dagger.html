<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1354 DR, nobleman Cheswick Goldwaters of Sembia was replaced by a greater doppelganger agent of the Unseen. The creature remained in the guise for the next twenty years, leading the man's wife Amberlyn Goldwaters to feel lonely, alienated, and unloved. The cruel ruse ended in 1374 DR when the doppelganger came face to face with the Hero of Daggerford . "Cheswick" bribed the nomadic tribe of frost giants , the Bloodaxe (tribe)Bloodaxes , to take his wife and use her to lure the Hero of Daggerford into a trap. The Hero slew the giants and rescued Amberlyn. The doppelganger knew his ruse was over, and he fled to report to his shapeshifting masters, leaving Cheswick's dagger behind for the Hero of Daggerford to recover it as well as leaving the hint in unraveling the threat plots of the Moonsea engraved on the dagger's blade.</p>
