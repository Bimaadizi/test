<p>Oleg's Weaponforge was a rather unsuccessful smithy found in Daggerford during the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It was located in the town's Caravan Quarter in western Daggerford along Guild Alley and Rogar Alley .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The half-orc Oleg crafted quality armaments including those that were required by mounted fighters. He was well-known for making longswords and bastard swords that often struck more accurately than other blades, if only for a certain time.</p>
<p>Despite the high caliber of his work, Oleg was often ridiculed by the local townsfolk and his forge attracted few local patrons. He did find steady clientele from among the adventurers that passed through Daggerford.</p>
