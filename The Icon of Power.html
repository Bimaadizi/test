<p>The Icon of Power was a traditional enchanted Loviatan halberd from the temple called the Black Spires of the Maiden .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Icon of Power bore a powerful and deadly +3 enchantment and allowed the wielder to brand their opponents with the symbol of pain three times per day, magically reducing their agility and defense, making them a much easier target for the heavy halberd.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The temple of the Black Spires of the Maiden stood in the Vale of Wailing Women and was mostly ignored by the churches of good deities who considered Loviatar an enemy. Nevertheless, the Black Spires had a significant garrison, led by the Whip of Obedience , traditionally armed with the Icon of Power . The blade's name and reputation inspired the temple's troops to strive for perfection and do better in their duties.</p>
<p>Sometime before 1281 DR , an unnamed thief from Elturel made stealing the Icon a personal challenge. The heist was successful and the halberd was sold to the Church of Bane . The weapon remained within the Banite temple in Anauroch , called the Obsidian Chapel , out of contempt for the Whip of Obedience's failure to protect the Icon of Power . Eventually, the Obsidian Chapel was plundered and razed during a Bedine raid.</p>
<p>Some time later, by 1281 DR , the Icon of Power ended up stored within the frozen Icasaracht's Temple on Lac Dinneshere in Icewind Dale .</p>
