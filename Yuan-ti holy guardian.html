<p>Yuan-ti holy guardians were a specialized subgroup of yuan-ti created to guard temples and other sacred places.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Holy guardians looked like massive serpents that were almost 7 feet (2.1 meters) when rearing upright, and weighed about 270 lb (120 kg). They had dark, patternless scales of mostly uniform hue except for some lightening towards the tail.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Yuan-ti holy guardians were dedicated to their purpose in life: protecting the holy places of their god. They were alert and diligent in this duty, and would die if necessary to accomplish it. They would disobey even clerics of Sseth when their order went against temple teachings.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Yuan-ti holy guardians were both venomous and capable of sensing venom and poison nearby them at will. They could psionically change the color of their scales to blend in with their surroundings, and could turn into a viper at will. Once each day, a holy guardian could produce an effect similar to the spell Evard's black tentacles , although the tentacles were also coated in poison.</p>
<p>Holy guardians could innately replicate the effects of the spells animal trance , cause fear , and entangle at will; deeper darkness , dispel magic , neutralize poison , resist energy (on themself only), and suggestion thrice per day each; and baleful polymorph (into a snake only) once per day.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Yuan-ti holy guardians could and would attack with their venomous fangs, or constrict enemies with their serpentine bodies. They were also known to use well-made scimitars or composite longbows in battle. Typically, holy guardians sought to use cover, traps, and other tactics as needed to gain advantages while fighting.</p>
