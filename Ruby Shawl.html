<p>The Ruby Shawl was a festhall located in the city of Berdusk in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It stood among the 3- and 4-story 'tall houses' of the wealthy Berduskan merchants that ringed the Castle Hill area.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Like other such establishments in Berdusk, the Ruby Shawl's signboard was illuminated with continual faerie fire , so that it glowed at night.</p>
<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
<p>Volo charitably described the Ruby Shawl as the typical "another" festhall of any city, and clarified he meant it was "a coarse, sleazy hole". It was known for its drunk and desperate clientele, and Volo cautioned that only the drunk and desperate need try.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Persistent stories told of an invisible magical brooch that had been misplaced by an inebriated guest in the escorts' quarters, leading adventurers to sometimes try and search them. The establishment denies the existence of such an item. However, some escorts had hired poor wizards and clerics to visit them in their rooms and try various spells of detection in efforts to find it.</p>
