<p>Nizidramanii'yt was a black dragon of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR who allied with Jon Irenicus .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nizidramanii'yt joined with Jon Irenicus to attack Suldanessellar in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR . Once there, the dragon guarded the Goblet of Life to prevent anyone from following Irenicus to the Tree of Life .</p>
<p>Thus, Abdel Adrian and companions had to face Nizidramanii'yt and acquire the Goblet. They could fight or bargain for the Goblet, but the dragon would only give it for all of their treasure—both gold and magic items —whilst lying that he had no other treasure himself.</p>
