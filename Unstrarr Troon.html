<p>Unstrarr Troon was a veteran member of the Purple Dragons in Suzail during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was young.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1479 DR , Hethel and four more Dragons acted as escorts for the War Wizard of Cormyr Ellard Gauntur in his pursuit of the renegade Rorskryn Mreldrake . Following Ellard Gauntur's impressions, they went to a portal to the King's Tower in Marsember first, where they found a woman; from a stain in her clothes, Ellard Gauntur quickly figured out it was Rorskryn transformed, but not until she'd already crossed. The group followed through the portal, except for Unstrarr Troon, who stepped back briefly to inform Corleth Fentable . Then the evil vampire archmage Manshoon sent the death knight Targrael after them to hide Mreldrake's trail.</p>
<p>Targrael found Unstrarr Troon running up the stairs after his delay, and caught up with him in a landing, slaying him very quickly.</p>
