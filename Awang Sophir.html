<h2>History</h2>
<p>Awang Sophir was a mysterious monk who arrived in Suijeng with four students from Petan to participate in the Komite. He was a master of the mystical style of silat but knew nothing about Chu' Yuan . Awang Sophir managed to finish among the tournament's finalists.</p>
<p>In one of the final rounds of the tournament, he competed against an adventurer but Awang was disqualified for his use of a magical lucky charm. Awang promised vengeance against the adventurer.</p>
<p>Later, Awang tricked some villagers into believing that his adventurer opponent and their companions were demons and sent them to kill them, but with no success.</p>
<p>Soon after, Awang took control of the leaderless taring village of Gigit in Kutuk Valley . He ruled there until his adventurer opponent and their companions and/or the previous vampire ruler Xi-Chu came to Gigit. Awang quickly escaped using his ring of teleportation to avoid a confrontation.</p>
<p>Following again his adventurer opponent and their companions, Awang was attacked by tigers and injured. However, he was nursed back to health by a barbarian tribe. Again he tricked the barbarians into believing that his adventurer opponent and their companions were demons and led them to Tempat Larang to have vengeance.</p>
<p>At Tempat Larang, he attacked the adventurers and Osari Minhiro just before they entered the demiplane of Qui but Awang was defeated. Nevertheless, he followed his enemies into the demiplane.</p>
<p>In Qui, however, Awang couldn't manage to find the exit and at last was killed and eaten by a pack of jackals .</p>
