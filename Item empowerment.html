<p>Item empowerment was the process by which a psionicist could imbue a weapon with power, similar to the process of magical enchantment .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<h3>Intelligence</h3>
<p>Every item that was imbued with psionic power was also instilled with an intelligent personality, capable of communication with any would-be user. This persona was influenced by the feelings and mindset of the psionic crafter, specifically during the time of the item's creation. If the user developed a relationship withe personality within their empowered item, it would typically function with higher efficacy.</p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>It was noteworthy that items created via psionic powers could not be detected by magical divinations .</p>
<h2>Differences from magical enchantment</h2>
<p>Unlike how a mage would use specific spells from a variety of schools of magic , psionicists could only use powers from a single science or devotion . Also, items that were to be empowered would have to be of the highest quality.</p>
<p>Despite the differences in the nature between their respective sources of power, psionically empowered and magically enchanted items were not mutually exclusive. An item that was empowered could be enchanted, and vise versa.</p>
