<p>Askume was a fungus that grew in the Underdark .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Askume grew in patches on warm cavern walls. Each reddish-orange patch was 1‒3 in (2.5‒7.6 cm) in diameter.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>Each patch of askume, when crushed, could yield 2–4 applications of a dust that could be blown into the face of an individual. The dust caused an allergic reaction making the recipient's tongue and windpipe swell, leading to suffocation and possibly death.</p>
<p>Those who purposely grew askume and sold it were vigorous in their protection of the patches for a dose of the poison could sell for up to 150 gold pieces each.</p>
