<p>Moonhaven , also referred to as the blighted village , or Bogrot , was a small settlement in the Western Heartlands that had ties to a nearby Selûnite temple. It fell into ruin after being repeatedly assaulted by soldiers, and remained in ruin for well over a century.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Alongside the temple, Moonhaven was situated on the Risen Road , some ways east of Moonrise Towers near the border of Elturgard .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Moonhaven formed sometime after the founding of the nearby temple of Selûne . It was raided by Dark Justiciars a number of times in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR .</p>
<p>In the early years of the formation of Elturgard, during the mid–15 th century DR , the Hellriders made multiple patrols around and near the village. This upset several of its residents, including Damon Briska , a descendent of the town's founders.</p>
<p>As of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the town was under control of a band of goblins that operated under the orders of Fezzerk , of the Cult of the Absolute .</p>
