<p>A tomb demon was a type of demon found within the Abyss . Tomb demons were the result of the power of the Abyss on mass graves, and often represented the horrible joining of a humanoid and snake, all with bone.

Orcus used his necromantic powers to raise the dead followers of Sylbarax, thus creating the tomb demons.</p>
