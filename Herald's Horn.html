<p>The Herald's Horn was an inn and brewery in the Western Heartlands in the mid-3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Herald's Horn was within Skuldaskar , at most one day of travel from Skuldask Road and around a tenday of travel to the southeast of the Reaching Woods . It lay in a small hollow, surrounded by open fields.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The signpost was on the corner of a paddock, reading "Be Welcome at the Herald's Horn". The sign had a painting of a silver horn. Several buildings close to it reeked of hops , and the gate had an overhanging iron horn. Beyond it lay a muddy yard. An iron gong hung close to the entrance.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The atmosphere smelled of cedar , and had at least one hearth with a chimney. The place had flagstones covered in sawdust, used tree trunks as pillars, and was poorly illuminated. Many planks bore the scorchmarks of old fires, and beetles wandered the floors freely. The smell indicated the whole place was used sometimes as a brewery.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Herald's Horn provided meals and rooms. As of 241 DR , the prices were two sp for a bed, another two for meals, and each tankard of drink was 1 cp . The ingredients for the meals served inside were strongly implied to include radish and pepper .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The perimeter was surrounded by a stockade wall. The owner, Drelden , claimed to throw out anyone who drew steel inside.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 241 DR , Elminster was a patron of the establishment for a night after losing his horse ; the owner, Drelden, claimed at the time to have built the place himself. During his stay, he met with the Red Blade , and purchased a Wyrmtongue scepter from Surgath Ilder .</p>
<p>Surgath was killed later by Heldebran , while that evening, Elminster's room was set upon by four different attackers.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Additionally, at least one more staff member was present: a young boy.</p>
