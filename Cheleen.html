<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She was the great-granddaughter of the black wyrm dracolich Calathanorgoth the Old One, the daughter of the black wyrms Vilholin and Wastirek , and the sister of the black dragons Woklef , Aswidorg , and Kasidikal .</p>
<p>Around 1479 DR , Cheleen took the adult male dragon , Sjachmalsvir as a mate and they had a brood of four eggs together.</p>
<p>Sjachmalsvir, calling himself "Thoss Fyurnen" was being worshiped by a tribe of lizardfolk , much to Cheleen's displeasure, and as such, to be rid of them she magically cursed the waters of her mate's lair with a horrid rotting disease.</p>
