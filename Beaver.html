<p>A beaver was a small common mammal.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Beavers constructed homes from wood that they gnawed from trees. Their homes were often close to, or in, ponds.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>They were of no threat to adventurers, as they dealt minimal damage and were not well naturally armored. Such small creatures were not particularly fast on either land or water.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Beavers appeared in packs from as little as ten, to up to forty.</p>
<p>Humans , dwarves , and others of the goodly races throughout Faer√ªn , would often kill and skin beavers for their pelts. Such pelts were valued at 2 gp each.</p>
<p>Giant beavers , huge and dangerous beavers, were known to exist in the Moonshae Isles .</p>
