<p>The Elfhold was an ancient crypt hidden under the Wyvernstones of Hullack in the Hullack Forest , Cormyr .</p>
<p>It was once used as a burial vault by the elves of House Amaratharr , where their remains were interred in small crypts carved into the walls of the grotto. The legendary human druid Hullack of Eldath , whose name lived on in that of the forest, was also buried here. It was said that Hullack could manifest as a ghost to those who came peacefully to seek long lost lore.</p>
