<p>The Scions of the Granite Tower were a group of swordsmen and women operating out of the Granite Tower in western Vaasa as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Scions were charged with defending the Granite Tower, and did so with a combination of swordsmanship, stealth, and strength. They did not necessarily remain at the Tower to protect it, and would sometimes travel or become adventurers . Each Scion was trained to wield a sword from an early age, and was generally a skilled fighter or swordmage .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The Scions' signature weapons were the powerful darkswords , which had been gifted to their ancestors as part of a pact with Melegaunt Tanthul , a Prince of Shade . A Scion rarely traveled without their darksword .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR , members of this group considered themselves "blood scions" of Bodvar the Black , the leader of their people who formed the pact with Melegaunt Tanthul in the Year of the Moat, 1269 DR . Their ancestors included not only the original wielders of the darkswords —the Moor Eagle tribe of Vaasa—but those original wielders' descendants who aided Melegaunt a century later in bringing about the Return of the Archwizards in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The ranks of the Scions were limited in size by the fact that only twenty darkswords were made for their people.</p>
<p>While their Moor Eagle ancestors had all been human , the Granite Tower had welcomed a pair of elves in 1372 DR, and soon their half-elven descendants became eligible to wield the darkswords as well.</p>
