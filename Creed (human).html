<p>After the Siege of Neverwinter in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Sergeant Creed was stationed at the Fallen Tower Tavern in the Tower District . He helped coordinate efforts to free that part of the city from occupation by the Many-Arrows orcs .</p>
<p>To accomplish this, he ordered an adventurer sent by Sergeant Alphonse Knox to slay orcish forces in Waukeen's Way to avenge the torture of Neverwintan captives. After this, Creed ordered the adventurer to rescue fellow guardsmen who had been captured while on patrol and threatened with torture at orc hands. To fighter and barbarians , he gave temporary field commissions with the rank of corporal and had them confirm that the Guard's barricades along Pedlars Path were well-secured and report their status to Janros. Finally, he tasked the adventurer with finding lost dispatches from slain Neverwintan couriers and completing their delivery to Janros; these would give Janros insight into the whereabouts of Karr Nevrim , a Nashers agent who colluded with the Many-Arrows orcs.</p>
