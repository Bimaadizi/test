<p>Threskel , also known as the Land of the Bone Wyrm , was an impoverished kingdom and one of the Old Empires of east Faerûn . It was famously ruled over by powerful and evil dragons , each of which engaged in their political struggles with one another, giving little if any regard to the people under their dominion.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The scattered cities of Threskel were dotted among arid lands that were too often poorly suited for farming. Its people lived hard lives that were not made better by the constant struggles that sprang up between their draconic overlords.</p>
<h3>Weather</h3>
<p>The climate of Threskel was made worse throughout the 15 th century due to the billowing volcanic smoke that spewed forth from the great volcano in the realm's northern lands.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Threskel was situated along the southern coast of the Sea of Fallen Stars , north of Chessenta and Unther , two nations that each claimed the land for their own at some point during recorded history.</p>
<h3>Geographic Features</h3>
<p>For most of its history, Threskel was a sparsely populated land that comprised wind-buffeted valleys, low-set plains, and harsh stonelands. After the Spellplague the landscape of northwest Threskel became dominated by a massive plateau that formed from these plains. Akadi's Dance was situated on the western side of the nation's northern shore, with the Long Beach across the shore's eastern side, along the Sea of Fallen Stars and northern Alamber Sea . The peninsula of Watcher's Cape lay in the northwest of Threskel, extending out into the sea.</p>
<p>After the change of Threskel's landscape, a small body of water called the Jade Pond formed south of the plateau.</p>
<p>Threskel's most famous landmark was Mount Thulbane , the realm's highest peak and an active volcano that continuously filled the nation's skies with smoke and ash after years of inactivity. The Fields of Pryollus lay at the base of the mountain, separating it from the Dragonback Mountains.</p>
<p>The Riders to the Sky was a range of hills and mountains that wrapped along the eastern side of Threskel. Its northern-most peak was Dragonback Mountain , the dormant volcano that housed the lair of the Great Bone Wyrm . The Barren River, that formed over the previous Jade River , flowed westward from Threskel's plateau before emptying into the Bay of Chessenta , while the broad River of Metals extended northeast from the Methmere and poured into the Alamber Sea.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>The lands of Threskel gave way to scattered verdant vegetation.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Throughout the late 14 th and 15 th centuries, dragons reigned over Threskel, most notable among them Alasklerbanbastos , the Great Bone Wyrm. He was served by the vampiric Jaxanaedegor , self-proclaimed Viceroy of Threskel.</p>
<p>While the people of Threskel, especially those in the capital of Mourktar , considered themselves to be an independent nation, foreign beliefs held that it was a part of greater Chessenta.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>While there was no overall culture for entirety of Threskel. the people of its cities borrowed features and attitudes from their neighboring lands. For example, those from Mordulkin shared a similar attitude with those from Chessenta while people from Mourktar and the eastern region were more alike with the Untheric peoples.</p>
<p>As with the other lands of the Old Empires, the Turami people were considered something of lower-class citizens in Threskel.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Some people in Threskel managed to make a living farming crops or more commonly by herding domesticated animals. They then sent their goods off for trade in the port cities of Mourktar and Mordulkin.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some years after the death of Tchazzar at the hands of Gilgeam during the Time of Troubles , the dracolich Alasklerbanbastos saw his opportunity to seize power within the region. In the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR , the Great Bone Wyrm claimed dominion over all of Threskel, and bequeathed each of its cities to his chromatic dragon followers as vassal-states.</p>
<p>Over a decade later, the chosen of Tiamat Rauthstokh sought to claim Threskel in the name of the Dragon Queen. Despite this, Alasklerbanbastos' control over the nation remained strong and defiant against usurpers. The greater threat to Threskel and its undead ruler came in the form of the restored Tchazzar, who returned to the realms as a mortal in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR during the Rage of Dragons . The great red wyrm laid his claim over Threskel and fought to restore his dominion over the region. Fortunately, the Great Bone Wyrm's rule was bolstered in the Year of the Lost Keep, 1379 DR , when it was supported by the church of Bane and the nation of Thay , their valuable trade partner across the sea.</p>
<p>Mount Thulbane erupted some time during the 15 th century DR , covering the skies over Threskel in smoke and black ash.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the resurrected Tchazzar rallied his army to defeat Alasklerbanbastos, subjugating Threskel as a vassal state of Chessenta. During that time the "Threskel frontier" as it was called became rampant with bandit activity and roaming bands of monstrous creatures.</p>
