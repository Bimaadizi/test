<p>Torgan Minerson was a human male, and the proprietor of The Roots of the Earth tavern in Eshpurta , Amn , in early 1370 DR, the Year of the Tankard . Torgan was once trapped in a mine cave-in and claimed he saw visions during the traumatic experience. He subsequently retired from mining and opened his tavern, which also housed a shrine to Grumbar , the King of the Land Below the Roots. Torgan retold the story of his entrapment and revelations to any who would listen.</p>
