<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ferdinand was a middle-aged human man with chestnut hair and a light skin tone. He was notably more relaxed than all of his teaching peers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ever since Ferdinand was a youth, he knew he wanted to work with animals but did not care for secluded life of a druid or a ranger . As an adult, Ferdinand worked at the Neverwinter Zoo , and eventually, apprenticed under the Academy's Keeper of Exotic Creatures. When the Keeper retired, Ferdinand took over. In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Ferdinand worked as an Academy instructor specializing in exotic beasts and monsters, teaching the students creature habits up close. Ferdinand's menagerie included a dire spider , an ettercap , a stag beetle , a hook horror , and an umber hulk , among others. Ferdinand was not the only person who cared about his beasts. Yusam , a local druid, visited Ferdinand's menagerie to inspect the creatures and them being well-treated. However, there were never any issues, Ferdinand cared for the beasts as if they were his children, always taken care of and monitored for injuries and sickness. The beasts were also ensorcelled to make them harmless to the students and the menagerie's visitors. His life was taken in the attack on the Academy that eded most of the school's students' and teachers' lives.</p>
