<p>Ha-yoon Kim was a human commoner from the Rivington district of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ha-yoon's name and appearance suggested a Kara-Turan descent. She hid her hair under a maroon coif and wore a corset , with a simple white ribbon for decoration around her neck.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the army assembled by the Cult of the Absolute moved from the Moonrise Towers in the Chionthar Valley to menace the city of Baldur's Gate, displacing countless refugees along the way. Pressured by the refugee crisis, Baldur's Gate closed the Wyrm's Crossing bridge, separating Rivington from other parts of the metropolis and turning it into a refugee tent city. Unlike many other inhabitants of Rivington, Ha-yoon Kim thought the looming threat of the Absolute to be nothing to worry about. She placed her trust in Lord Enver Gortash and his capability and desire to protect the Baldurians.</p>
