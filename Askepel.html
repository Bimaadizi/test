<p>Lord Askepel was a leader of the Knights of Synnoria on the island of Gwynneth in the Moonshae Isles during the late 15 th century DR . He was a key participant in a Synnorian plot to overthrow the ruling le Shay of Sarifal .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Askepel was old even by elven standards, and had lived so long as to have become a shell of his younger self: he'd lost nearly all of his ability to feel passion beyond pride and self-interest; he felt little kindness, love, or sense of friendship; and he had little interest in art or music.</p>
<p>He was coldly intelligent but arrogant and supremely assured of the superiority of his people, so much so that it made him incapable of understanding what motivated them. He assumed that other races simply did not share the morals of the Llewyrr, and he believed that the likes of humans should see it as an honor to be able to work alongside his Knights regardless of their needs or grievances. He reacted to any disagreement from humans as an insult, or as if he had smelled something foul, and made no effort to conceal his contempt for those he perceived as lesser. Any offense committed against the Llewyrr was a grave and severe act in his eyes.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He had a cousin (his father's sister's son) named Oemeril Talos–claere , who served as a guardian of the borders of Synnoria.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Askepel and his fellow conspirators against the le Shay operated out of an abandoned fortress known as Harrowfast that sat on the border of Synnoria . His dissatisfaction with his rulers had grown beginning in the early 15 th century DR as it became clear to him that the le Shay could no longer be trusted.</p>
<p>In the late 1470s DR, a fellow member of the Knights named Mindarion successfully brought fomorians and humans into a discussion of alliance to overthrow the le Shay. The Knights of Synnoria lacked the numbers to win a war against the le Shay's supporters and drow mercenaries, and so this alliance was necessary for them to succeed in their desire to be free of High Lady Ordalf and to replace her with her half-Llewyrr sister, Amaranth . However, the savvy Mindarion was badly injured just prior to the meeting, leaving Askepel to negotiate in his place. Askepel seemed unable or unwilling to acknowledge the fomorians and humans as true allies, instead expecting them to unquestioningly serve his interests. Negotiations deteriorated slowly, they collapsed after the human leader, Captain Rurik , and a companion of the fomorians, Suka , accidentally trespassed into Synnoria and killed three Llewyrr while escaping, including Oemeril Talos–claere. After Rurik fled from Harrowfast, Askepel and his Knights confronted the fomorian princess, Marabaldia , and attempted to take Suka into custody. In response, Marabaldia invoked her "evil eye" to stun him, and despite his self-assurance that her powers would not work on him, he was struck completely immobile. Askepel survived the ensuing battle—although he lost his sword —while Suka and the fomorians fled from Harrowfast with the help of Mindarion.</p>
