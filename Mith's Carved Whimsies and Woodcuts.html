<p>Mith's Carved Whimsies and Woodcuts was a specialty woodshop in Sundabar that belonged to the extremely skilled, though somewhat child-like, woodcarver Mith Tlalant .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Mith reveled in delighting the children with small, wooden carvings of animals, monsters and even personalities of Faer√ªn .</p>
<h2>Repuitation</h2>
<p>Despite their innocent nature, Mith's hand-size crafts were popular enough to be found in far away lands such as Kara-Tur and Maztica . They sold for a fairly steep price of 700 gold pieces , but foreign collectors were willing to repurchase them for thousands of gold pieces.</p>
