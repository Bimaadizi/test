<p>The Regal was the enchanted helmet that belonged to an unnamed individual who sought to eliminate all drow in the Underdark , sometime before 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Regal possessed several defensive enchantments. The item absorbed part of the punishment dispensed at the wearer; additionally, it granted them resistance to fire and acid, both mundane and magical. The Regal's design made it more challenging for the wearer to see through.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , The Regal was worn by a lone one-person-crusade against the drow of Underdark. The man's name was lost to history, and his campaign was ended prematurely in violence. His body was buried in an unmarked grave, and The Regal was claimed as a trophy by the drow who slew the crusader. Since then, the helmet surfaced in several locations in the Underdark and on the Sword Coast . In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , the The Regal was seen in the hands of clerics of Cyric in Mulmaster .</p>
