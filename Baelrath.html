<h2>History</h2>
<p>After Ashmadai cultists had taken over the city of Helm's Hold during the 1470s DR , several of the devil -worshipers made their way to the crypts found beneath the Cathedral of Helm . Just after their Prophet Rohini was slain upon the cathedral's altar, the Ashmadai in the catacombs managed to complete the ritual to bring forth Baelrath to the Prime Material Plane , warping the stone and earth around their summoning circle .</p>
<p>The great pit fiend enjoyed a short stay on the Prime however, as it was nearly immediately slain by the same heroes that struck down the cult's prophet moments earlier.</p>
