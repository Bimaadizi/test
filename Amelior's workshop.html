<p>This workshop was the residence of Amelior Amanitas when he lived in the village of Volkumburgh in 1358 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This workshop was situated west of the village's inn, the Crimson Wyrm .</p>
<h2>Exterior</h2>
<p>This workshop was a huge structure, towering over every other building in Volkumburgh. It had a heavy oakwood door, with an elegantly painted nameplate that read, "A. Amanitas — Alchemist." There was also a hidden door off to the side.</p>
<p>The frame of that main door was marked with many alchemical and magical symbols, as well as many copies of Amelior's personal sigil . Any attempts made to force the door open by physical or magical means would cause the perpetrator to be shrunken down to 3 inches (0.076 meters) in height.</p>
<h3>Interior</h3>
<p>The entry room of the workshop was small, dusty, and dimly lit. It had bags, books , bottles, scrolls , and all manner of containers scattered about. On one of the walls was a wardrobe, that in actuality was a covert entryway into the workshop's main room, opening into a loft.</p>
<p>This main room was cavernous in height, built to support the 30 feet (9.1 meters) tall Awtawmatawn that Amelior sought to reconstruct. Around the edges of the room were glowing globes on pedestals. A complex system of scaffolds surrounded the construct , with narrow wobbly catwalks and ladders . Once the construction of it was finished these scaffolds were disassembled, all clutter was pushed aside, and a complex web of block and tackle was erected in order to lower the construct's head into place.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Amelior Amanitas came to the village of Volkumburgh in 1358 with the goal of reconstructing the fabled stone golem known as Awtawmatawn, he constructed this towering workshop to conduct his work in.</p>
<p>When a group of adventurers he had hired to deliver one of the golem's legs from Suzail arrived at his workshop, they were confronted with a huge bladder that Amelior had inflated and painted to look like a beholder . He was using it hold the place of the Awtawmatawn's missing head and laughed riotously at how the adventurers responded to it.</p>
<p>Eventually, the adventurers managed to acquire the rest of the golem's fragments for him. A few days then passed, with Amelior sequestered within his workshop and refusing to see anyone. A week later the day finally came for him to complete his construction of the golem and he sent his manservant Erek to invite the adventurers to witness the moment. As he lowered its head on to the body with block and tackle, its eyes began to glow. Ten minutes later the evil spirit that had been inhabiting the fragments of the golem finally regained full control of the Awtawmatawn and began to rampage across the village, destroying Amelior's workshop in the process.</p>
<p>Amelior's manservant Erek shielded him with his body as the building fell around them, saving his master's life but sacrificing his own in the process. After the adventurers found him within the rubble and acquired magic items from him to fight the golem with, Amelior revived Erek and used one of his exotic one-use artifacts to travel back in time. They then emptied his workshop of important valuables, returned to the present, and escaped on his flying gasbag before they could face retribution from the villagers.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In addition to Amelior Amanitas, this workshop was lived in by his manservant Erek and Amelior's many colorful cats .</p>
