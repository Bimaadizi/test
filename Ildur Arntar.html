<p>Ildur Arntar was a human fighter and innkeeper of the Nighthunt inn, which stood on the Dawn Pass Trail a day's ride east of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale , in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ildur was once a ranger and adventurer until he lost his divine powers; he would never speak of how and why.</p>
<p>By the mid-1360s DR, he had settled down with his family as the proprietor of the Nighthunt. He was still there as of 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He and his wife, Shaltana had four daughters, two of whom were restless and keen to become sword-wielding adventurers themselves. He was also aided at the inn by six former adventuring companions. They were famous for their prowess in battle, at least in the area.</p>
<p>Ildur was both an ally of the Harpers and an enemy of the Zhentarim . In particular, he was a vocal critic of their grip on Llorkh , so some feared the Zhents would target him for it.</p>
