<p>Chandri was a Selûnite priestess and the chief healer of Moonshadow Hall in Yhaunn during the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Chandri organized the infirmary of the temple and provided healing for those who required it, using mundane healing supplies, alchemical potions , and divine healing magic . The infirmary fell under the auspices of the senior priestess Velsinore , who handled the accounting and logistics of supplying the infirmary. Unknown to Chandri, Velsinore sourced many of her medications from the Sharran priest and alchemist Bolan .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By 1373 DR , Chandri served under High Moonmistress Dhauna Myritar and, in Eleasis of that year, she served under Moonmistress-Designate Feena Archwood during her brief tenure at the temple. When Dhauna forced Feena to infect her with lycanthropy , Chandri healed Dhauna's wounds and attempted to administer belladonna to counteract the curse. Dhauna refused to take the treatment and used lunar magic to forcibly transform into a werewolf , so Chandri and the others locked their former leader in a secure cell, though not before the werewolf destroyed much of the infirmary.</p>
<p>In the investigation that followed, Chandri assisted Velsinore in examining the records in the archives that Dhauna had accessed. Following Feena's uncovering of Velsinore as a heretic before the temple, Velsinore inflicted a deadly wound on Mifano as a distraction, and Chandri saved his life with her healing magic.</p>
