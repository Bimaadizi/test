<p>While in her humanoid form, the matriarch kept a small study and laboratory nestled within a cave in the upper reaches of the Whispering Depths.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to Eliette's Bloody Journal , her past on the surface of Faer√ªn was filled with regrets. At some point, she fell into the hands of a minor drow house . Throughout her captivity, Eliette devoted herself to the spider goddess, Lolth , witnessing visions of the house's demise and the death of their matron mother . Patiently awaiting the prophesied day, Eliette carefully planned her escape and managed to break free, reinforcing her allegiance to the goddess.</p>
<p>While Eliette was dwelling in the caves of Whispering Depths , she heard whispers from the darkness, which she interpreted as speech from Lolth herself. She believed this was her calling to undergo a transformation. Some time later, she received a pair of spiderstep boots , a gift from the spiders within the surrounding caves.</p>
<p>The Tattered Journal said, that some time later, she found the dead body of a drow arachnomancer . Being of "organ and bone" Eliette dreamed of taking a form more appeasing to her goddess. She believed that the gifts from Lolth were the signs that the time of her transformation was at hand.</p>
<p>Within the pages of her Web-Covered Journal and Burnt Journal , she conveyed her eagerness about the chance to deepen her connection with the goddess. She decided to go through the ritual called Transcendence . In her cave study Eliette researched the ways to become a phase spider matriarch and kept most of her journals written in some manner of code, with notations added in common . She tried using some spells, but they were not enough. She had a Ritual Diagram describing the process of transcension.</p>
<p>During or before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the she made her final transition, taking on the form of the massive phase spider . Over the next while, it appeared as if she began to produce some manner of webbing from her body. She became capable of laying and hatching large clutches of eggs.</p>
