<p>Twinkledust was a type of fireworks , on par with firecrackers , made using smokepowder in the Blade Kingdoms .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Twinkledust was considered harmless and childish toy by military men of the Blade Kingdoms. In 1217 DR , when Lomatran Blade Captain advocated for the use of arquebuses and smokepowder for warfare, Blade Captain Orlando Toporello angrily compared it to playing with firecrackers and twinkledust as opposed to soldering with honest swords and more traditional arms.</p>
