<p>"Y'lara" was a yochlol trapped in Menzoberranzan in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A yochlol was sent by Lolth to help Archmage of Menzoberranzan Gromph Baenre in a demon lord summoning ritual in late 1486 DR . The yochlol knew the true plot behind the spell. However, after the summoning, Gromph also understood the true meaning of what he did, and he magically trapped the yochlol in his private sanctuary before it escaped the city. Posing as a drow priestess called "Y'lara", the yochlol tried to obtain someone's help in order to escape.</p>
