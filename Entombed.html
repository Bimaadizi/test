<p>Entombed were a variety of human or humanoid undead creatures encased in a large hulking shell of mobile green-tinted ice, created when a humanoid froze to death and bonded with the ice around it.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The shell of ice that formed around the dedicated humanoid corpse resembled an ogre in size and shape. The body was usually well preserved, and its face was frozen in an eternal scowl of fear or sorrow. The body's skin tone often took on a frozen whiteish hue. Their shells of greenish ice were able to move and kill.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Entombed possessed darkvision and tremorsense , allowing them to see in the dark and feel where their victims were when they touched the ground. As undead, they were unaffected by mind-affecting effects and magics, poison , sleep , paralysis , stunning, diseases , and death magic . Their abilities nor energy could not be drained, they could not become tired, and they could only be resurrected if willing.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Entombed could slide through through ice and burrow through snow, making ambush their favorite tactic. Travelers who moved across frozen lakes were vulnerable to a surprise attack from below and entombed could attack from out of the lake while remaining protected by the lake's ice. They tried to grab the victims and drag them into the ice. A mere grapple by an entombed froze the victim via its supernatural cold. Humanoids who were killed by an entombed and dragged into the ice, or died within the ice, turn into entombed themselves within six to twenty-four seconds. The new entombed were under full control of their undead creator.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Entombed were undead creatures who needed no sleep, food, nor drink. They could not speak but were able to hear and understand the Common Tongue .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Jaluth Alaerth , the Overwizard of the North, uncovered a Netherese ruin in The Giants' Walls of the Reghed Glacier and using her magics, created a handful of entombed to serve as her protectors.</p>
