<p>The Surprising Habits of Kara-Turian Warlords was a self-help book of dubious nature that promoted the Sharran House of Grief of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The book was a rough assembly of printed pages and a bound cover.</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>The Surprising Habits of Kara-Turian Warlords had little to do with Kara-Tur and, instead, was aimed at helping those readers who disappointed their elders in a strangely cruel tone. The book's long-winded text could be summarized as a propaganda of obedience and advertisement of the House of Grief's services.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , The Surprising Habits of Kara-Turian Warlords could be found in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate and was available in the House of Grief's small garden.</p>
