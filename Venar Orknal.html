<p>Venar Orknal was a bloodforge mage in the Utter East during the time of the Bloodforge Wars ( 648 – 657 DR ).</p>
<p>Venar was on a campaign to unify the war-torn and fractious Utter East through conquest, exactly like the rival Legendary Campaign . For months, Venar Orknal and the Legendary Campaign leader had outwitted each other with no victory. Finally, they agreed to a contest of skill and bloodforge battle prowess within the Puzzle Palace , with the loser to give up their mission and claim to the realm for all time.</p>
