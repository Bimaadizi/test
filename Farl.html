<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early Life</h3>
<p>According to Farl, his mother had been a courtier who bore Neldryn Hawklyn , the most powerful of the Magelords of Athalantar , an unwanted child, so he had her killed and meant for him to die too, but slew the wrong baby by mistake as he had been rescued by a coinlass friend of his mother. His adoptive mother was then killed at some later date, by another coinlass, "almost certainly" one who worked at the Kissing Wench . He bore a grudge for that against Neldryn, and had little sympathy for coinlasses.</p>
<h3>228-229 DR</h3>
<p>One snowy day in 228 DR , at some point on or after the month of Hammer , Farl met and befriended the young price Elminster Aumar after the latter came to Hastarl and was promptly targetted by the bullyblade Shildo . The young thief convinced Shildo that the stranger was already claimed for experimentation by another Magelord, making him desist. Though the stranger introduced himself as Eladar the Dark, Farl eventually managed to pry out of him that his parents were killed by a dragon-riding Magelord, and that he was an outlaw sworn to kill all the Magelords. At some point in their relationship, Farl urged Elminster to buy himself a night of lovemaking, with a woman, which he did.</p>
<p>Eladar and Farl began to work together. They used an alley in Hastarl to stash their loot, in a nook hidden behind a loose brick. By summer of the Year of the Black Flame, 229 DR , they had plans to instead use a hollow gargoyle as a hiding hole. At around that time, the two also were interrupted at the Kissing Wench tavern, where Jansibal Otharr , a local idle noble heir, almost had Eladar killed, which was stopped only by the actions of Thelorn Selemban , a rival rake, and Adarbron , a local swordsman. The two thieves had their revenge, however, by knocking out Jansibal while he was enjoying the affections of local coinlass Shandathe Llaerin , then luring Thelorn into the same stall and knocking him out as well. They stole away with Shandathe, and hurled her into the window of Hannibur , a local baker, anticipating a violent response from the two nobles and their entourages; the two thieves laid low at an old cemetery, where they took shelter in Ansildabar's Last Rest for three days and three nights. There, they decided to scout out a couple rich houses, including one that Farl had been thinking about for five years: he'd managed to bribe a server to let him take the job for the evening, so as to get himself inside. He had no such arrangements for Elminster, who went on his own.</p>
<p>Farl took the place of a server at that house during one evening, but midway through the evening, all the guests were evicted violently; later that night he managed to knock out a guard that was chasing his friend Eladar, who told him Neldryn Hawklyn had been killed by the Magister of Mystra which he had summoned, and the Magister in turn had killed a number of others. Farl and he immediately resolved to rob the houses of some of the dead; while they tried that, they clashed with the Moonclaws gang for the first time. Due to the intervention of the Moonclaws, Farl and Elminster were detected, and had to escape with no loot.</p>
<p>After Farl and Elminster failed to rob some Calishite silks, again because of the Moonclaws, Farl met with over a dozen other thieves and called for the formation of a rival gang, which he dubbed the Velvet Hands . The gang was joined by Eladar, Tassabra, Jhardin , Chaslarla , Rhegaer , Larrin , and Tarth ; present at the meeting, but refusing to join were Klaern Blaenbar , and his brothers Othkyn Blaenbar and Korlar Blaenbar . After the Blaenbar brothers left, Farl exchanged some signal with Jhardin. By the next morning, the Blaenbar siblings were dead, and Farl told Elminster that he believed Jhardin had done it, and approved of the killing, as he believed the Blaenbars were in league with the Moonclaws already.</p>
<p>The Velvet Hands were attacked by more of the Moonclaws that very night; Farl survived, and decided they needed to hit back, choosing to do so just as the Moonclaws robbed Athalgard . Though they managed to kill some of them, a gargoyle from Athalgard came after the Velvet Hands, and by the time they managed to destroy it, they were surrounded by the Moonclaws. Though Farl and Tassabra managed to slay Storntil of the Moonclaws, Farl was slain, Tassabra was mortally wounded, and only Eladar managed to leave in reasonable health; all the other Velvet Hands perished.</p>
<h3>Resurrection and Later Life</h3>
<p>Farl was shortly after resurrected by the Magister of Mystra, Dorgon Heamiiolothtar , alongside Tassabra . After that resurrection, Farl continued his thieving career together with Eladar; they were together for one last heist at the nuptial room of Peeryst Trumpettower and Nanue Glarmeir , where they were once more impeded by the Moonclaws. However, after that heist, to Farl's appreciation, the Moonclaws just didn't have the numbers anymore. Elminster also left the gang at around that time.</p>
<p>By 240 DR , Farl had become quite well-to-do indeed, a wealthy man of Hastarl, a trader and investor, though he was still the leader of a new generation of Velvet Hands thieves. He was approached by Elminster again, who revealed to him that he was the Crown Prince of Athalantar, and that he had secured the cooperation of the elves of the High Forest as well as the outlaw Knights of Athalantar , asking Farl for his aid in seizing Athalgard and breaking the reign of the Magelords and King Belaur Aumar both. Farl accepted.</p>
<p>During their attack on Athalgard, Farl's Velvet Hands were instrumental in seizing magic items, spell components, and other instruments that mitigated the threat of the Magelords, while the leader himself struck the towers of the Mage Royal himself, and that of Malanthor Drymm , where he almost came to harm. He later helped Anauviir and Helm Stoneblade , then outlawed Knights of Athalantar, find their way into Athalgard through the sewers. He also fought with some of the Knights and his own thieves to actually seize Athalgard.</p>
<p>During the coronation after the successful siege, Farl entered the throne room at the head of his guild. He took part of the dancing afterwards; he left early on later, being already in the streets with Tassabra by dawn of the next day.</p>
