<p>Selûne's Promise was a mace once wielded by the Selûnite priestess Fassa "the Melancholy".</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The mace was colored white and blue. The words "Never Forget" were carved into its shaft.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Already a formidable weapon normally, Selûne's Promise was especially effective against incorporeal undead . With every strike, however, there was a small chance that the wielder would temporarily lose their resolve and flee from battle.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Winged Gift, 1156 DR , Fassa, leader of a band of Selûnite undead-hunters, was the sole survivor of the group after a disastrous foray into the Sepulcher of the Dim . In agony, the priestess prayed to Selûne that she may never forget what had happened on that fateful night. The Moonmaiden granted this request in the form of Selûne's Promise , which appeared on Fassa's bed the night of the following full moon.</p>
<p>Fassa would go on to become a near-fanatical hunter of undead in the years leading up to her early death at the age of 33. During the night of a full moon, in the company of her fellow clergy, the priestess renounced her faith in Selûne, and a few hours later she threw herself off of a cliff into the Moonsea . Her mace was left behind in her room, and would be kept by the church for many years, until a later high priest threw the grim object into the same lake in which its owner met her demise.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , the mace had made its way to an Eldathyn temple in Dragon's Eye .</p>
