<p>Lord Dermod Ophal was an Amnian nobleman who lived in the City of Coin, Athkatla during the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Dermod Ophal was extremely snobbish, and dismissive of those lacking social status. The married couple would loudly whisper about an appearance of anyone who approached them, deciding where they were from and what status and wealth they had.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Lady and Lord Dermod Ophal were regular patrons of Waukeen's Promenade in the Center District of Athkatla. They sat atop a large wooden platform surveying the wonders of the marketplace without resorting to speaking to the lesser people that conducted business within.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Both Lady and Lord Ophal were active in Waukeen's Promenade around the time a great magical battle between the Cowled Wizards and unlicensed spellcasters —the cruel archmage Jon Irenicus and Imoen —destroyed a section of the amphitheater, in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR .</p>
