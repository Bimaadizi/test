<h2>History</h2>
<p>Femter Deldrannus was one of the Dreadspells sent with Elryn to find and slay a Chosen of Mystra near Westgate two tendays into the Chaos of the Art in the Year of the Hearthstone, 797 DR . During the first leg of the trip, he had Uldus Blackram lead the way, while holding the noose around the man's throat. When Uldus Blackram was killed by Ilbryn Starym , Femter found this funny.</p>
<p>Once they found the ruin, Karsus' Keep, Femter helped loot the place of magic, and in particular found a ring that cloaked against seekings and hid all dweomers. The team of Dreadspells then sought to bring down the whole ruin on top of two people they spotted, a self-styled god Azuth and the Chosen of Mystra they sought, by using all their looted magic to hurl destructive spells at them. Once their looted magic failed against Azuth, despite bringing down the ruin, they fled.</p>
<p>When Dread Sister Klalaera appeared and herded them back against Azuth, she used some agonizing power on Femter to convince the others before having him stand and walk. They were stopped partway by Umbregard and Starsunder , two mages that appeared suddenly, and he made another attempt to escape, which was cut short by her control again. She then used him to absorb an attack from Starsunder, which left nothing but chunks of him.</p>
