<p>The Tesh Inn was a luxurious inn and festhall found in the city of Zhentil Keep during the mid-to-late 14 th century DR before that city's destruction.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Tesh Inn was located in Zhentil Keep's Foreign Quarter on the south bank of the River Tesh . The inn sat in the far eastern corner of the quarter on Bridge Street near the South Tesh Gate .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This was easily the most lavish inn located within the Foreign Quarter. The luxury within the inn came at a price of 30 gp per evening which included meals, lodging, and entertainment.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Exotic escorts from Chult , Calimshan , and Chessenta quickened the hearts of the Tesh Inn's patrons.</p>
<p>Though it survived the destruction of Zhentil keep in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , the entertainment to be found within suffered greatly. The inn still rented 44 rooms to patrons at the same prices. The inn was the Foreign Quarter's most prominent festhall, featuring exotic women to entice patrons.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Tesh Inn was owned by Lord Payr'adar who infused the inn with his southern style. Most, if not all, of the employees of the inn, including the escorts, were members of the Zhentarim who gathered information for the Black Network.</p>
