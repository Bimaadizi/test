<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR, Urdek was a part of a gang of three criminals who operated out of abandoned Valjevo Castle in Phlan. On one fateful day, the three chiefs were discussing splitting the day's loot between them. Urdek being the largest man out of three, attempted to threaten them with his stiletto, demanding a larger share, only to murder one of his buddies and wounding the other. During the same moment, the dreaded pool of radiance breathed back to life, refilling the crescent-shaped hole in the ground, empty for decades. The pool devoured the dead thief and grasped the wounded one. Urdek watch in morbid curiosity as his two recent allies were twisted into undead creatures. The whole scene was witnessed by Kestrel , another thief who was hiding her own loot nearby.
