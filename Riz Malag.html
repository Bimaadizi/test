<p>Riz Malag was a destroyed settlement in the Underdark beneath Cormyr , somewhere near the drow city of Sschindylryn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Long ago, Riz Malag was destroyed by forces from Sschindylryn, who attacked by opening a portal into the middle of the settlement. By the 15 th century DR , Riz Malag was a crumbling ruin inhabited only by forces from Sschindylryn, with the old portal still active and offering a direct route into the drow city. Mind flayer allies of the drow made up part of the defenders, along with the magister Durnibas Uxyndar who studied water elementals . The hezrou Chorzan also found an opportunity to pass into the Prime Material plane there, appearing on an overlook above the ruins.</p>
