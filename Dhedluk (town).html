<p>Dhedluk ( pronounced : / d ɛd ˈ l uːk / dead-LUKE ) was a village in the King's Forest of Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Dhedluk was a beautiful village of about 100 rustic cottages interspersed with gardens, dappled by sunlight reaching down through the eaves of gigantic mossy trees. It was a popular place for nobles and Purple Dragons to retire to, which was why a small stone and timber hut could be sold for upwards of 16,000 golden lions .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Dhedluk lay in the heart of the King's Forest, with the Ranger's Way linking it to Waymoot in the southwest and Starwater Road leading north to Eveningstar and south to Immersea .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The expansion of cleared land was severely curtailed and regulated, so little logging took place. The local business was mostly made up of skilled woodcarvers and herbalists who took advantage of the woodlands and bogs around the village, with some minor farming and gardening in the available space. Three quail ranches and a boobrie farm were also in operation in the 1360s DR , with boobries wandering the area freely hunting snakes and vermin.</p>
<p>By the 14 th century DR , the cutting of live wood without authorization was considered a severe crime, eventually being punished by hanging.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The village was protected by a wooden stockade and a local militia.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dhedluk was originally named after and ruled by the Dheolur noble family who lived there. The family was eventually disbanded after opposing the Crown one too many times. A local woodsman by the name of Dhedluk was made lord of the village in recognition of his loyalty, and the name changed to match his. Despite this, decades later it continued to be known as Dheolur by those from particularly isolated parts of the realm.</p>
<p>In 1369 DR , the events of Halaster's Higharvestide resulted in a tribe of kobolds , led by Vhue , coming to reside in the thick forest about half a day east of Dhedluk. Their existence remained secret, as the few who stumbled across them were slain.</p>
<p>By 1479 DR , those who were caught cutting live wood were hanged on the defunct portal arch nearby.</p>
