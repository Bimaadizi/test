<p>A Steward of the Grove , also known as a Watcher over the Grove , was a powerful druid of the Earthmother who acted as a caretaker and guardian of a Great Grove on the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Once a druid became a sufficiently powerful spellcaster, they were eligible to have a Great Grove entrusted to their care. These Stewards' primary duty was to tend to the moonwell at the center of their grove. They spent most of their time cleansing the moonwell as they spoke prayers to the Earthmother. If not tending to this duty, they were never far away and could be swiftly summoned. They took their duties incredibly seriously, and valued the sanctity of their moonwell over their own lives.</p>
<p>Stewards were also entrusted with overseeing other druids. They were always accompanied by two lesser (although still quite powerful) druid guardians, and if unable to tend to their duties for some reason, they enlisted another powerful druid to assist them.</p>
