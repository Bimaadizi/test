<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime shortly before the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Glisena Foesmasher , the daughter of Baron Thuragar Foesmasher of Sespech refused Ridimere Cordwin's advances. Since then, the man's father, Vandemar Cordwin, sought revenge against Baron. Whether this was caused by the failed courting, was unclear. However, that did not stop gossips and rumors on the topic.</p>
