<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Chessae had short white hair and wore a suit of light armor.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Chessae was a close friend of Kelgoth Darksong , and was his first follower in Eilistraee's Wanderers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Chessae and the other drow followed Kelgoth Darksong to Myth Drannor , with the goal of restoring the mythal and impressing the Elves of Cormanthor . The group stayed at the fortified camp there , but the surface elves were uncooperative and refused to join in on their outlandish quest. Frustrated by this, Kelgoth went into the ruins on his own, setting an example for Zelliira and Uhlsdrin Nirveth as they searched for the Key to the Mythal . Unfortunately, Kelgoth was slain by the dangers inside the Safehold of the Speculum , leaving Chessae to discover his fate when she sent a group of adventurers to rescue him. Their plan was ultimately vindicated, as the Icon of the Elves was found and recovered.</p>
