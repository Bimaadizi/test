<p>Turien Battlewake was the old dwarf mayor of the free city of Lachom in the Vilhon Reach , in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Turien's rule was guided by his own bitter experiences, as well as stories of his parents and grandparents about Lachom's tumultuous past and the city's suffering at the hands of Chondath .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , a band of fire giants from the Deepwing Mountains , led by a witch doctor named Kinondra , started menacing the city and burning down farms outside Lachom's walls. Turien put out a call for adventurers brave enough to end the menace. Unbeknownst to the Mayor, the fire giant raiders were hirelings of the short-reigned ruler of Arrabar â€”Lord Simon Dessino . The lord was attempting to show Lachom that the city needed protection and alliance with Arrabar. He was ready to order his giants to attack the city and deal several humiliating defeats that would leave Turien Battlewake no choice but to ally with the much-hated nation of Chondath.</p>
