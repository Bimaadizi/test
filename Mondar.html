<p>Mondar was a dwarf and resident of Dalekeva .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa −700 DR , a group of Netherese hunters preyed on the masses nearby Dalekeva. A dwarf known as Dorlas heroically slew one of the riders, but died in the process. Mondar and two other dwarves worked through the night to construct a coffin for the dwarven hero. Mondar led the funeral, and invited two of Dorlas's comrades, Sunbright Steelshanks and Greenwillow , to sprinkle soil upon his coffin before it was sent down the river.</p>
<p>Dorlas's items were distributed by Mondar to other members of the funeral, and the barbarian, Sunbright, accepted Dorlas's warhammer to honor him. Mondar promised to pass the word to Dorlas' relatives that lived in the Iron Mountains .</p>
