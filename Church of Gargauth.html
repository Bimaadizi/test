<p>The Church of Gargauth was a collection of clerics and specialty priests, called malefactors , devoted to Gargauth , the Hidden Lord.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The split between Gargauth's clerics and malefactors was roughly equal, but the Hidden Lord saw more potential for his personal gain through malefactors. Titles within the clergy in ascending rank included Supplicant and Lord of the First Pit (Second Pit, etc. through Ninth Pit). Higher ranking clergy attained their own personal titles that were variations of the true name of a baatezu destroyed by Gargauth in the past.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>All agreements between the clergy of the Church of Gargauth and others were documented with signed contracts in the name of the Lord Who Watches. Gargauth personally enforced any breaking of one of these contracts by an outsider, visiting the offender with his divine wrath. In contrast, Gargauth encouraged his clergy to break a contract if it was in his favor.</p>
<p>Gargauthans kept their faith a secret from others. They were tasked with enticing and corrupting others into signing binding contracts with Gargauth. Furthermore, Gargauth's faithful were tasked with hindering the Churchs of Shar , Iyachtu Xvim , Loviatar , and Cyric . Even more resources were spent in conflicts with the faithful of Lathander and Tyr .</p>
<h2>Celebrations</h2>
<p>Gargauth's faithful recognized several holy events including the Unveiling and the Binding .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Dark Pit of Maleficence , hidden within the ruins of Peleveran within the Landrise , was a prominent center of power for Gargauth's followers. Others temples of Gargauth were found beneath the cities of Baldur's Gate , Bezantur , Laothkund , Myratma , Sheirtalar , Teziir , and Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Orders</h2>
<p>The Church of Gargauth did not sponsor its own knighthoods, but they were heavily involved with the operations of the Knights of the Shield .</p>
