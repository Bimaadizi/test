<p>Able was a warrior-cleric of Tyr who was a part of the rescue team sent to the Utter East to rescue Piergeiron the Paladinson 's bride circa 1371 DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Able was a close friend and an ally of Miltiades , Harloon , Trandon , and Kern Desanea of Phlan, where he was well known for his skill with a warhammer and clerical war magic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , on Eleint 17 and 18 , Able, along with other paladins of Phlan, was in attendance at the wedding ceremony between the Open Lord of Waterdeep Piergeiron the Paladinson and Eidola of Neverwinter .</p>
<p>The wedding was a disaster that resulted in the bride's abduction. Able was part of the rescue team assembled by Khelben Arunsun to travel through Undermountain to reach the only portal to the Utter East that was in the vicinity of the city. Blackstaff was unable to teleport the paladins to the portal directly because of Kern's anti-magical abilities, leaving the party with only one choice—traveling through Skullport .</p>
<p>When the paladins reached Skullport, the group was tasked with aiding zombies by the mysterious Skulls of Skullport in penance for destroying one of the watchers. The group split apart in search of undead to aid. Able felt fear of the undead caused by his past failures to turn them with the power of Tyr; he sweated profusely, his breath was caught in short heaves and gasps. Even so, he had to perform the task. Able found himself in a city filled with the undead and, upon noticing a zombie that used to be a teenager, the cleric lost the last of his composure. He tried to destroy the walking corpse with his turn undead ability, and it failed. Instead, Able took his warhammer to the undead and disposed of the body. The cleric felt that he aided the zombie by releasing its spirit.</p>
<p>After the paladins passed out of Skullport, they encountered a group of ettins . An unfortunate skirmish let to the death of Harloon , for whom Able delivered a prayer before the rescue team had to move on.</p>
<p>Closer to the destination, the paladins came across tanar'ri aiming to use the same portal as the heroes. Barlguras were using a magical mirror located not far from the portal to create duplicates of themselves. Another battle broke out. Able felt the terror of not being able to access his god's divine powers to save his comrades. Thankfully, at the last moment, Tyr granted the cleric the power to stop the advancing tanar'ri. Able held them off long enough for the rest of the paladins to escape. A barlgura seized the cleric, ripping his head off but granting Able a heroic death in service of the god of justice.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Able had iron-black hair and deep chocolate eyes. He kept his chiseled jaw clean-shaven even though it remained shadowed even with daily shaves.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Able was a devoted follower of Tyr, but still had deep-seated insecurities and fears that interfered with his divine abilities. He felt shame and fear of the undead after one of his failed attempts to turn undead almost cost him his life. He was prone to panic facing the undead ever since.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>During Abel's heroic sacrifice, he was granted divine ability by his god. The symbol of Tyr on his warhammer burned bright, eliminating the entire cavern in holy light. He was able to hold a group of barlguras back, saving his comrades.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Able, like many other paladins and clerics, carried a holy symbol of his faith.</p>
<p>He also wielded a warhammer adorned with Tyr's scales of justice on its head.</p>
