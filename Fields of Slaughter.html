<p>The Fields of Slaughter was a large plot of land running between the Spine of the World and the Severed Hand .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The fields were named after a great battle that took place between elven and orcish forces. The blood was said to have been so much that the fields were red for months. Long after, however, the fields were used extensively as a pathway for merchants, travelers, and adventurers.</p>
