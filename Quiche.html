<p>Quiche was a type of small savory open-faced hand- tart handfood from northwest Faer√ªn and the city of Neverwinter .</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Neveren quiches were pies typically filled with cheese , spinach , and mushrooms . They could be consumed hot as well as cold. Elminster 's favorite variety was made with yellow cheese and meat. During some of his trips to Earth and Ed Greenwood 's home, Elminster partook in a variety of Earth's mass-produced quiches, which he didn't care for, and once he even made quiche with a mysterious local meat called "spam."</p>
<p>Tupidratkrea's summon quiche spell had some relation to the tarts, presumably summoning them via magic.</p>
