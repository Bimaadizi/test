<p>Seelie were a kind of jovial sprite seen only in the Yuirwood of Aglarond .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These creatures varied greatly in their appearance. Most resembled small graceful humans with a height range of a single inch to one foot. They could alter their height within this range at will. Seelie could have animal appendages as well. All seelie could fly, but not all of them actually possessed wings.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Seelie usually avoided direct conflict, preferring instead to prank targets and remain hidden. They could become invisible at will. They wielded tiny swords and bows that were treated with a sleep poison capable of knocking opponents out for several hours. Seelie often rode mounts such as large insects wielding lances treated with the same poison.</p>
<p>All seelie could use magic but only had a few spells at their disposal. Potential spells included: sleep , dancing lights , shocking grasp , fog cloud , irritation , improved phantasmal force , stinking cloud , slow , Tasha's hideous laughter , polymorph other , and Otto's irresistible dance .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Seelie were shy creatures that did not usually initiate contact with the world outside of the Yuirwood. When they did it was usually for some mischievous purpose. Seelie society was comprised of commoners, nobility, and royalty. The spellcasting abilities of seelie increased with their station. They spent much of their time feasting and reveling, rarely doing anything that appeared to be actual work.</p>
<p>These creatures claimed to live on invisible demiplanes that were perhaps still connected to Toril via the Yuirwood's ancient magic. They hated their vile cousins–the unseelie .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The seelie were locked in a conflict with their cousins that lasted for centuries. Neither side seemed able to get advantage over the other.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>These faeries had practically no effect on the outside world. All of the sustenance they required was derived from the demiplanes where their homes were located. Rarely did they actually hunt or forage within the Yuirwood.</p>
