<p>Connel Greylore was a skilled archer that served as a sentry and leader of the armed forces of Shadowdale during the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the Zhentilar army marched upon Shadowdale in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Connel led the sentries that took roost in the trees beyond Krag Pool . In the opening exchanges of the battle that would follow , Connel and his arches rained volleys of arrows upon the first Zhent soldiers that stepped foot within their range, maneuvering others into wooden stake traps they had erected.</p>
<p>This success was quick-lived however, as Connel was taken down by a volley of arrows launched by Zhent archers in response.</p>
