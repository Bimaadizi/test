<p>Crab was a collective name given to a number of species of crustaceans found in the Realms and often used in culinary pursuits. There existed mundane and giant crabs, as well as saltwater and freshwater varieties.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Crabs were foul-tempered crustaceans encased in shells with its colors differing depending on the species. They had powerful pincer claws that, depending on the crab's side, could open an adventurer 's armor like a tin can. They were also known to be able to become one's familiar or an animal companion , while giant crabs could be dominated through magic and turned into fine mounts.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Crabs were commonly cooked across the Realms. In Calimshan , crabs were served boiled and stuffed.</p>
<p>In Cormyr , soft-shelled crabs were breaded and fried, served dusted in sugar . Another Coemyte treat was Marsemban tarts that contained diced salmon and crab.</p>
<p>Along the Dragon Coast , clams and crabs were abundant in Westgate , where the city's poor descended on the beaches to dig for their next meals.</p>
<p>In the Dalelands , freshwater crabs were caught for food in Archendale , along the shores of the River Arkhen .</p>
<p>On the Sword Coast , crab meat was used to make crab cakes , like specialty dish of the Elfsong Tavern in Baldur's Gate .</p>
<p>In the Frozenfar, numerous crab species inhabited the Sea of Moving Ice, but smaller crab was fished out of Maer Dualdon and used as a food source by the locals. The meat was nutritious but quite bland in flavor. The region's crabs consumed serpent stars and fishers sometimes used them as crab fishing bait. The crab fishers of the Ten Towns used pots to trap the critters.</p>
<p>Sharkey's Bar & Grill of Ravens Bluff in The Vast sold live-caught crabs, and served cooked giant crab's legs or whole giant crabs. Crabs were also the specialty of the Fresh Fish shop and The Lambent Eye , where crabs were fried in lemon beer . And Fish Tails served fishcakes made with various sea-critters, including crab. And in the nearby Mossbridges , the Golden Goblet Inn had stuffed devil crab on the menu.</p>
