<p>Eveningstar Gorge , or Starwater Gorge , was a gorge in Cormyr that was notable as being the location of the infamous Haunted Halls .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The rocky gorge was beautiful and had very steep walls. The gorge was often full of mist, which flowed down from the High Moors .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Eveningstar Gorge was located north of the town of Eveningstar , where the Starwater River broke through the Stonecliff . This allowed one of the only routes up to the dangerous Stonelands , as it was the only gap in the Stonecliff along the entire length of the High Road from Tyrluk to Arabel . The gorge was very narrow 5 miles (8 kilometers) from the town and widened as one went south.</p>
<h2>Flora & Fauna</h2>
<p>The base of the gorge was covered with scrub trees and thickets, some of which produced berries. Brave children from the town played there often.</p>
<p>Tressym , the famed winged cats, were thought to have originated in the Eveningstar region, and most of the population lived and hunted in the gorge, keeping rodent numbers low.</p>
<p>In the winter, wolves would migrate down from the Stonelands to the gorge to hunt, giving rise to the term "wolf winters" for particularly harsh winters in the region.</p>
