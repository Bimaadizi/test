<h2>History</h2>
<p>Florizan was born as the youngest son of a royal family in a kingdom far to the south of Waterdeep . From a young age, he was trained in dance, music, and poetry.</p>
<p>When he was 10 years old, he was the sole survivor when the family was betrayed, overthrown, and killed. He was smuggled out of the palace by his music teacher, and joined a travelling circus under his new identity as "Florizan Blank". His experiences living in both luxury and poverty gave him a keen sense of the importance of kindness and truth.</p>
<p>Florizan began his adventuring career at the age of 16. At some point, he saved the life of a witch by using his powers of persuasion to avert her execution. In gratitude, she gave him his signature mask.</p>
<p>After having gained a great reputation for his acting, Florizan eventually returned to his old home where the tyrant who slew his family still reigned. He wrote and performed a play that exposed the tyrant's crimes and incited a revolution, overthrowing him. At this time, Florizan refused the chance to retake his family's throne as he preferred the travelling life of an actor.</p>
<p>When hobgoblins raided Red Larch , Florizan attempted to track them into a forest, but had little luck. However, he came across a pseudodragon and—realizing that it was amenable to his charms—considered breaking off his search to tame the creature. He hoped to offer it as a familiar to a spellcaster in exchange for curing a friend who had recently contracted lycanthropy .</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , Florizan was known to be a performer at the Pink Flumph theater in Waterdeep.</p>
