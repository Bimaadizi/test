<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early Life</h3>
<p>Kira was born in the mid-1480s DR to Edgin Darvis and his wife Zia in Targos, one of the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale. Edgin was at that time an agent of the Harpers , having taken the oath whilst Zia was pregnant with Kira. Zia was beside him, supporting his choice and knowing the risks, even that their unborn child might lose her father. /> Overall, Edgin defended Faerûn from "creatures, crooks, and cretins" as he put it, but given his family's modest living standards with cheap clothes for Kira, Edgin came to chafe at his Harper code, even though Zia hardly cared. During his tenure as a Harper, not long before the birth of his daughter, Edgin faced a wailing banshee , whose voice he later compared to his uncontrollably crying newborn.</p>
<p>Then, on one mission, Edgin and two fellow Harpers captured a Red Wizard of Thay in his treasure-stuffed lair. Seeking revenge, four Red Wizards rode into Targos one night and came to his cottage. But Edgin was away, so they attacked Zia, but not before she was able to hide the newborn Kira in a hidden compartment in the wall. When Edgin came home, he found Zia laying dying to a Red Wizard blade that prevented resurrection . Afterward, Edgin blamed himself and quit the Harpers.</p>
<p>Suddenly a single father and penniless, Edgin struggled to take care of young Kira for the following few months. Then, down on his luck, Edgin had a chance meeting with the exiled Elk tribe barbarian Holga. After Edgin had suffered many sleepless nights and the unending cries of the newborn, he went with Kira to the Trip and Shuffle tavern in Targos. Desperate for some food and comfort, Edgin used his dwindling emergency funds for a bowl of stew, a tankard of ale , and milk for Kira. Calm and relaxed, Edgin slipped into sleep with the cooing baby next to him. When he woke up, Holga was there, holding Kira. Still groggy and confused from passing out, Edgin lashed out at the stranger taking his child, but Holga stopped the attack with one hand before it could begin. Edgin quickly realized that the barbarian woman and his newborn were enamored with each other. Holga had noticed the father dozing off and kept an eye on the newborn, keeping her safe. After dinner, Holga walked the young father home and hesitated to leave. Edgin realized that she had nowhere to go and offered Holga a room to stay for a few days. Holga never left and Kira never cried again. The duo became fast friends, even like adopted siblings, though she later alleged she just needed someplace to sleep out of the cold and had felt sorry for Kira. Holga helped care for Kira, becoming a mother figure to her. Without coin, skills, or other prospects, the pair turned to crime, at first just to provide for Kira. When both tried to rob the same pawn shop in Targos—the shop's owner was an agent of the Zhentarim , and the goods ill-gotten—this led Edgin and Holga into a life of adventuring and theft.</p>
<p>Four years later, they made a smash-and-grab robbery of a jewelry store, simply breaking the window with a rock and making off with the jewels. Holga gifted one piece, a jeweled pendant, to Kira, who promptly disappeared! Fortunately, she soon reappeared with what they realized what was a pendant of invisibility .</p>
<h3>Child Thief</h3>
<p>Eventually, when she was old enough to understand what they did, Kira insisted on joining them. After that, they took the girl with them on their robberies, having Kira sneak about unseen inside manor houses to steal valuables and pass them out to Edgin while Holga took the heavier stuff. In one incident, Edgin and Holga robbed the house of the unscrupulous Lord and Lady Bantakent , while the invisible Kira played up a fake ghost haunting to distract the owners, even waving their dog Miffles through the air.</p>
<p>Later, in the 1490s DR, Edgin, Kira, and Holga formed a team with the confidence trickster Forge Fitzwilliam and the sorcerer Simon Aumar after a chance meeting at the Trip and Shuffle in Targos. Throughout their schemes and heists together, Forge was always urging them to set their sights on higher targets and greater riches. Nevertheless, Edgin retained something of his old Harper sensibilities and saw to it that they never hurt anyone and only stole from those who wouldn't suffer for the loss.</p>
<p>Finally, one night whilst they were celebrating a score at the Trip and Shuffle tavern in Targos, a mysterious hooded figure calling herself "Lady Sofina " met the team. She wanted to hire them to help her steal the treasures of Korinn's Keep , a Harper storehouse that only a Harper could enter—Edgin. Against his better judgement, Edgin accepted, with hopes of finding there a Tablet of Reawakening with which he could restore Zia to life. However, this time he reasoned it was too dangerous to bring Kira and so left her with a friend in Targos, promising it would be their last robbery. He also didn't tell her of the Tablet for fear of getting her hopes up only to dash them later if he failed. But Edgin and Holga would not return, having been arrested and incarcerated in the Revel's End prison. Instead, it was Forge Fitzwilliam who collected Kira from Targos and together they moved to Neverwinter.</p>
<h3>Ward of Neverwinter</h3>
<p>Over time, dear 'Uncle Forge' lied to Kira and turned her against her father, until Kira thought he'd just abandoned her to seek more riches, that is, the so-called "Tablet of Riches". Forge kept the real Tablet of Reawakening hidden and never shared Edgin's true reasons. He presented himself as a having turned over a new leaf. When Lord Dagult Neverember suddenly took ill, Forge seized the opportunity. He waged a political campaign financed with his ill-gotten gains and became Lord of Neverwinter with Sofina as his chief advisor. Forge, Kira, and Sofina all moved into Castle Never , and sometimes, Kira would use her pendant of invisibility to sneak around the castle. Though Forge might claim Kira saw Sofina as a role model, in turn wizard disturbed the girl.</p>
<p>After two years, Edgin and Holga escaped from Revel's End and came to Neverwinter to collect Kira. At Castle Never though, they had a less-than-warm reception. Lord Forge kept them waiting and Kira was now eleven years old and while she was happy to see Holga, she was estranged from her father, and also his prison-made mittens were less than impressive. She blamed Edgin for leaving her and didn't believe him when he gave his real reason for going off on the robbery, that is, to resurrect her mother. Finally, Forge revealed a wanted poster with a bounty for Edgin and Holga, causing Kira to run away in tears. Afterward, Forge met with Kira, pretending to console her, but lied to her still, cruelly claiming he'd given Edgin and Holga the 'Tablet of Riches' and they simply left without her. In fact, he and Sofina had arranged their secret execution, but Holga and Edgin managed to escape and infiltrate Castle Never and rescue Kira.</p>
<p>However, much later, Edgin and Holga, joined once more by Simon and their new teammate Doric , infiltrated Castle Never as part of an elaborate heist and rescue mission. At the time, Kira was glumly watching the High Sun Games in the new Neverwinter arena from the window of her room in Castle Never. Edgin found her room confessed he had been terrible father, for abandoning her to resurrect his wife, not the mother she'd never known. But it fell on mocking ears—it was not Kira at all, but Sofina, who threw off her disguise and caught him in her Evard's black tentacles spell.</p>
<p>Shortly after, Forge took Kira out of the castle and hurried with her to the docks, where he had a ship loaded with treasure waiting to take them out of the city. But the ship had already been seized by Edgin and friends. Edgin apologized to Kira and called her to him, which was when Forge showed his true colors and took her hostage, threatening the child with a knife. Fortunately, a well-thrown potato from Holga took care of him. Kira fled back into Edgin's care and the team sailed away on the boat. With Kira having realized all of Forge's lies, father and daughter were finally able to reconnect. While the group at first sought to sail away and claim the riches for themselves, with Edgin at last taking the long-sought-after tablet of reawakening , the sight of Sofina invoking the horn of beckoning death over the arena quickly changed their minds. Edgin and the others devised a plan.</p>
<p>Returning to the city, Edgin encouraged Kira to use her pendant of invisibility to stay safe and out of sight while they fought the Red Wizard. He also gave her a magic-suppression cuff from the games for the key part of her plan. Finally, when Sofina cast a time stop spell, though herself victorious and stopped to gloat, Kira crept in and slipped the cuff around Sofina's wrist, negating all her pellcasting abilities. In fact, Simon had managed to counterspell the casting and he and the others had only pretended they were stopped in time. Doric wild shaped into a snowy owlbear and put the defenseless Red Wizard down for good.</p>
<p>However, in the battle, Sofina had struck Holga in the heart with her Red Wizard blade , just as Zia had been murdered years before. The barbarian died in Edgin's and Kira's arms. As he and Kira grieved, Edgin realized that his and Kira's relationship to Holga was now much more important than clinging to the memory of his lost wife, and that it was Holga who'd been as a mother to his daughter. Thus, Edgin and Kira chose to use the tablet's one charge to revive Holga instead and the reunited family had a tearful hug.</p>
<h3>Saviors of Neverwinter</h3>
<p>With the negation of Sofina's magic, the former Lord of Neverwinter, Dagult Neverember awoke and resumed his resign. His first acts were to award the saviors of Neverwinter medals of heroism.</p>
<p>Kira went with Edgin and his friends to Doric's village in the Neverwinter Wood to celebrate their victory. Though Edgin had an opportunity to return to the Harpers, he chose to stay with "his people"—Kira, Holga, Simon, and Doric.</p>
