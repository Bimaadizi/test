<p>Pavel was a farmer in Neverwinter and student at the Neverwinter Academy who retired to an innkeep's life in Icewind Dale during the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the city of Neverwinter put a call out for adventurers to investigate the deadly disease known as the Wailing Death in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Pavel and his twin brother, Bim , forewent their life as farmers and joined the academy. When the academy was attacked that same year, Bim died in the initial assault and Pavel joined the Hero of Neverwinter for a brief time as they escaped from the depths of the academy into the city proper.</p>
<p>Surviving the assault on the Neverwinter Academy, Pavel returned back to his family's farm, only to discover his parent dead from a plague . Crushed by the loss of his twin brother and parents, Pavel decided to start anew somewhere else, away from the painful memories. The young man sold the farm and everything he owned and headed north. Arriving to Targos , one of the Ten-Towns of Icewind Dale, Pavel decided to spend all of his saving on purchasing the Luskan Arms inn that was happened to be on sale at the time by its previous owner. Pavel found peace in running the inn and the business was good, he even created a brew named after his beloved brother â€“ Bim's Brew . In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , the Hero of Neverwinter happened to find themselves in the Ten Towns as Icewind Dale faced encroaching doom and strife and Targos was flooded by refugees from the smaller of the Ten-Towns. Pavel was elated to see his old friend and offered them free lodgings, refusing to take a single copper .</p>
<p>After the Hero of Neverwinter emerged victorious in a great battle for Targos and the defeat of demigod Arctus , Pavel promised to name a drink after then, thankful for yet another heroic feat of theirs.</p>
