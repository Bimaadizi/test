<p>Thessaltrices were one of the four known thessalmonsters , a species of crossbred hybrid creatures. A thessaltrice was the result of crossbreeding a thessalhydra and a cockatrice .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The thessaltrice looked almost identical to a thessalhydra. It had a large reptillian body, a long tail that ended in a pair of sharp pincers, and a large central mouth instead of a head. Surrounding this mouth were eight serpentine heads. Unlike other thessalmonsters, the eight heads of a thessaltrice resembled that of a cockatrice, not a hydra , and were covered in feathers.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Each of the thessaltrice's eight heads had the ability to petrify a target via physical contact. This petrifying ability was so powerful it extended into both the Astral and Ethereal planes . If one of the heads was severed from the body, it regrew over a period of ten days.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Each of the serpentine heads acted independently and injected a poison with each bite.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Thessaltrices were found only in warm climates within jungles and swamps. They made their lair within caves.</p>
<p>Some were known to be found in the land of Chult .</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>Juvenile thessaltrices were sometimes used as guards. Thessaltrice eggs were worth up to 5,000 gp and a live juvenile up to 10,000 gp.</p>
