<p>The Golden Sword of Ammatok was an important sword in the kingdom of Koryo in Kara-Tur .</p>
<p>Each year after he took the throne in the 1350s DR , a ceremony held on Wei Do Peak to honor King Wanang Sun culminated with the king himself ritually beheading the most infamous criminal in the kingdom's prisons. This act symbolized his power to defeat evil in the kingdom. It was rumored that when the king wielded the Golden Sword of Ammatok to do this duty, a spirit of the Celestial Heavens would appear beside him and consecrate his rule under their guidance.</p>
