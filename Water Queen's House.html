<p>The Water Queen's House was a temple of Umberlee in Baldur's Gate in the midâ€“14 th century DR . It was the city's oldest temple and one of the only true temples to the Sea Queen in the Realms at the time, thanks to the tolerance and openness of the Baldurians. The name was said to be a euphemism.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It was located in the northern docklands along the waterfront.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Established some time before 1358 DR , it stood through 1367 DR and after 1372 DR .</p>
<p>By the end of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the Water Queen's House, under the leadership of the Flood Tide Allandra Grey , planned to have enough money to purchase Nurthammas family's shipping yard. The church believed that the docking dues had been too generous. With the temple's control of Baldur Gate's docks, tariffs would be increased and the city's wealth would eventually rival that of Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>At the time, Jalantha Mistmyr was the lead Storm-Priestess of this temple to the Bitch Queen and she was aided by eight zealous priestesses and sixteen followers.</p>
<p>As of 1482 DR , Allandra Grey served as Flood Tide of the temple, and led about twenty priestesses, called waveservants.</p>
