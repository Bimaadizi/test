<p>Scathrys was a black dragon or fang dragon , possibly pseudonatural , that lived in Gethshemeth 's lair in Taunissik during the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Scathrys had teeth as long as Anusha's forearm. The creature's chin was full of spikes, and its face resembled a skull with deep-set eyes, each lined with two rows of horns.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>For whatever reason, Scathrys was unwilling to tangle with incorporeal creatures, and seemed to derive a strange mirth from taunting and lying.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Scathrys was capable of perceiving, however incompletely, incorporeal creatures, with sufficient accuracy to dodge some of their attacks. Per Raidon Kane , who was wielding Angul at the time, the dragon bore a certain taint that he couldn't abide, suggesting some sort of aberration taint. Its breath weapon was a line of acid, and it could induce terror with a roar.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1396Â DR , Scathrys dwelled in Gethshemeth's lair. It participated in the ambush set for Seren Juramot , Nogah , Japheth Donard and Thoster , breathing acid at them from concealment and then frightening them with a roar.</p>
<p>When Raidon Kane entered the lair, the dragon almost pounced on him, but stopped as it noticed the invisible presence of Anusha Marhana 's dreamform, who demanded to know of the fate of those who had entered the lair before, referring to Japheth , Thoster, and Seren Juramot . Rather than attack, it decided to taunt the intruders and urge them on their way to the kraken , claiming that the comrades Anusha wanted to rescue were vowing fealty to it.</p>
