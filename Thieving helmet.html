<p>Thieving helmets were special helmets worn by some rogues .</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>One of the most important senses to a thief is his sense of hearing. Common helmets muffled the ability to hear lock mechanisms or approaching guards, among other things. A thief wanting to protect their head and still be able to hear had the option of wearing a thieving helmet.</p>
<p>Thieving helmets were invented by a gnome from Waterdeep . They had special ear canals added to the structure of the helmet that amplified incoming sound to a thief's ear. These helmets sacrificed some structural protection in order to make way for the ear canals, but were better than nothing.</p>
<h2>Prices</h2>
<p>A thieving helmet cost 10 gold pieces .</p>
