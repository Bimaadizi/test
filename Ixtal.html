<p>Ixtal was the easternmost settlement of the Maztican nation of Huacli , first to fall to the bloodthirsty Nexalan empire in the 12 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ixtal was a minor town with a population somewhere between 5,000 and 15,000 humans . It was located at the southern end of the mountain chain that separated the Valley of Nexal from the arable valley where the city-state Pulco stood.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ixtal's most notable historic event took place in the 12 th century DR, during the reign of Ipana III as the Revered Counselor of Nexal . During the era of growth, Ipana sought to satisfy the Nexalan deity – Bloody Zaltec . The Revered Counselor led the empire's armies to subjugate settlements of Cordotl and Palul only to be turned around by the defenders of the Maztican nation of Kultaka . Disheartened by that loss, Revered Counselor Ipana turned his attention to his western neighbor – Huacli. The military campaign was ruinous to the Huacli peoples, and Ixtal fell to the Nexalan armies, becoming yet another subjugated city-state of the empire. For the remainder of the Nexalan empire's existence – into the 14 th century DR, Ixtal paid regular tributes to Nexal – food, precious materials, and slaves.</p>
