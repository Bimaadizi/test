<p>The Sea of Moving Ice , also referred to as the Floating Land by the Reghedmen barbarians, was a collection of icebergs and frost-covered isles that floated in the waters of northwest Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Sea of Moving Ice was located west of Icewind Dale and northwest of the Cold Run .</p>
<h2>Geographical Features</h2>
<p>Almost completely uncharted, the ice masses set wide enough apart for a ship to pass. The ice of the sea changed so that all but the most experienced seafarers could be caught off guard. Proof of such are a collection of ancient ice-locked ships.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Along with seals , walruses and polar bears , the Sea of Moving Ice was also home to other dangers. Lairs of ice trolls could be found in errant shipwrecks, and white dragons often made home within larger icebergs.</p>
<p>Few humans made their home among the icy bergs. Among the few that did were the nomadic Ice Hunter tribes, and whalers who dwelled upon the sea's icy shores.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Chilled Marrow, −343 DR , the arcanists of Ythryn found a mysterious stone spindle that beneath the seam, an artifact that dated back to the ancient kingdom of Ostoria .</p>
<p>The Waterdhavian whale hunter Jendren Uruth made regular excursions into the sea in search of ambergris during the late 1480s DR .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>A portal in the Sea of Moving Ice led to the High Ice in north Faerûn . It was protected by the orc druid Thurghom .</p>
<p>While the majority of the Reghedmen tribes believed the bergs of the "Floating Land" to be forbidden, the Tribe of the Seal once attempted to settle its isles.</p>
