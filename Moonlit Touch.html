<p>The Moonlit Touch was a festhall and nightclub in the city of Arabel in Cormyr in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . It was highly recommended by Volothamp Geddarm .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The club was located in the southwestern quadrant of the city, on the same street as the shop of Daglar Maermeet , an armorer.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Moonlit Touch sold a very large assortment of quality beverages for fair prices. Food was free with entrance and was served on platters carried around by staff. The platters contained a variety of greasy handfoodsâ€”for example, deep-fried breaded quail or drumsticks made from turkey .</p>
<p>Escort services were available here, but guests negotiated prices with the individual escorts.</p>
<p>The Touch was primarily a dance club. Attendees spent most of their time dancing around the establishment, accompanied by happy music from the resident minstrels, sometimes while bearing candle lamps . Some older men in the city were known to come to the club simply to drink and to people-watch the younger dancers. (One such observer in 1368 DR was a retired high-ranking Purple Dragon officer, who knew many rumors about Arabel, the Zhentarim , lost treasures, bandits, and even weredragons .)</p>
