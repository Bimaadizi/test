<p>Fredegast was the young sheriff of the halfling town of Waukeshire in Bloodstone Barony in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Fredegast was an able, bright and charismatic military leader but could be brutal and efficient in dealing with his enemies.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1357 DR , Fredegast was the leader of the halfling militia and the sheriff of Waukeshire, and was therefore a key member of the Alliance of Belt Watchers , a mutual defense arrangement with the dwarves of Clan Orothiar and the centaurs of the Warrenwood .</p>
<p>In 1358 DR , Fredegast and 150 of his archers ambushed Gareth Dragonsbane 's party, mistaking them for bandits. After learning from Garlen and Garvin that the party had come to aid Bloodstone Village , Fredegast wished them luck but was unwilling to commit his own militia to their cause at that time. However, he soon became an important ally to Gareth, and his archers aided the forces of Bloodstone in the Bloodstone Wars .</p>
<p>As of 1359 DR , he was still sheriff but was primarily responsible for the operations and upkeep of the Warren , a massive underground fortress constructed by the Alliance of Belt Watchers.</p>
