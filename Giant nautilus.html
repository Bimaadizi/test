<p>Giant nautilus were an extra-large variety of their diminutive cousins native to the Elemental Plane of Water .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Giant nautiluses looked much like the ordinary nautiluses that were found in the oceans. Adult giant nautiluses had spirally coiled shells of 50‒60 ft (15‒18 m) in diameter, and twenty strong tentacles encircled the mouths of the giant nautiluses which they used for every kind of manipulation necessary. They were very long-lived, with a natural life span of between 3,000 and 4,000 years. They had a form of telepathy that allowed them to communicate with any intelligent creature, regardless of languages spoken and understood.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Often called “druids of the deep” due to their absolute neutrality and great insistence on maintaining the balance of the underwater world, and they were known to be used by tritons , merfolk , and locathah as impartial judges to mediate disputes among themselves and the different races. They considered sunken ships a terrible eyesores and would actively help in removing them, even going so far as to protect those who were removing the ships from the great predators that lived in the depths. While they were totally uninterested in treasures of any kind, that were not stupid nor naive, and understood the concepts of avarice and greed. Thus they would demand that sunken vessels carrying mundane cargo be removed before they allowed those storing treasure to be taken away, and that the entire vessel were removed, not just the cargo. Giant nautiluses seldom attacked humans or any other intelligent ocean-faring or dwelling race unless in self-defense, even the sahuagin and ixitxachitl were safe as long as they refrained from attacking. For all of their peaceful ways the giant nautiluses were quick to stop any who overfished or polluted the areas where they held sway. If their pleas and attempted negotiations went nowhere they would intimidate the offenders. If even that went on deaf ears they would resort to force, dragging down small ships and rocking the larger vessels until damaged.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>In combat the Giant nautiluses would attempt to constrict their foes with some of their tentacles, and bite their victims if they could drag them into their mouths. They additionally use their spells to either pacify or slay their foes.</p>
