<p>The Golden Fox Martial Arts School was a once-renowned school in the city of Akkaido on the island of Tsukishima in Wa .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>While the school was open, all individuals who reached the rank of the Master were gifted special enchanted Golden Bamboo Staves . The school's end came in the early-to-mid-14 th century DR , then the Masters of the Golden Fox came into a conflict with the notorious Yakuza . By the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the Yakuza emerged victorious in the conflict, and to ensure the Golden Fox Martial Arts School would never be reestablished, they hunted down and destroyed the Golden Bamboo Staves . Even though there were seven in existence, at least one of the weapons was saved and taken out of Wa.</p>
