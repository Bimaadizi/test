<p>The Khopet-Dag , also known as the Spiderhaunt Peaks , was a mountain range located in the Endless Wastes .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Located north of the Shalhoond sat the Khopet-Dag mountain range, most famous for its large number of giant spiders , which gave it its nickname "Spiderhaunt Peaks".</p>
<p>Rocky and dry on the north side, and wooded on the south, the mountain's environment was ideal for the many spiders that lived there.</p>
<p>The silk of these giant spiders was highly prized for its use in making clothing and ropes that were lighter and stronger then normal, but also far more expensive.</p>
<p>Yaqubi , people who collected the valuable giant spider silk for a living, frequented the mountains, guarding the secret locations of their web harvesting grounds, and the secrets behind the tools used to harvest the sticky spider web.</p>
