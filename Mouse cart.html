<p>A mouse cart was a enchanted cart specially sized to be drawn by a mouse and that could be expanded to human proportions.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Each instance of a mouse cart resembled a wooden cart, complete with two wooden wheels and a leather harness, but in a miniaturized state.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Once the harness of a mouse cart was placed upon a mouse, or any creature that was polymorphed or otherwise transformed into the form of a mouse, the cart would grow to human proportions. The harnessed mouse would retain its size but fall under the effect of an enchantment. This enchantment not only enabled the mouse to pull 250 pounds (110,000 grams) of cargo but also compelled to obey all oral commands issued by the individual that had harnessed them, forgoing their natural instincts and behavior. However, the enchanted mouse would not fight if commanded and would not engage in actions it would naturally be incapable of performing. The enchantment persisted as long as the mouse remained harnessed.</p>
<p>This magical effect would only function on mice and no other type of creature.</p>
