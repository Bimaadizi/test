<p>The Cult of Ragarra was a religious organization in Zakhara dedicated to the worship of Ragarra , the savage Zakharan jungle goddess.</p>
<p>As of 1367 DR , the Cult's power was severely diminished compared to their influence throughout the Cities of the Ancients during the centuries that predated the spread of Enlightenment .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The primary goal of the Cult during the 14 th century DR was to reestablish worship of their goddess by any means necessary. It was not sheer coincidence that the number of crocodiles living in the rivers and canals of the Ruined Kingdoms increased drastically with the resurgence of the Cult. Any who still dared to oppose Ragarra met grisly ends while traveling the waterways in the region.</p>
<p>Priests of Ragarra visited the villages of the jungle, demanding tribute for their goddess. Any who refused had their personal property rended .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before its decline, the empire of Kadar outlawed worship of Ragarra and destroyed all temples associated with the goddess, littering the jungle with ruins.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Cult of Ragarra was based in the heart of the wild jungles of the Cities of the Ancients region of east Zakhara , mainly within Dihliz , Rog'osto , and Kadarasto . Their main base of operations was a secret temple found within the ruined undercity in Kadarasto.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Prince of Kadarasto, Nari ibn Aman secretly courted the Cult of Ragarra, allowing them to infiltrate his city.</p>
