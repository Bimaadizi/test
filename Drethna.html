<p>In the late 15 th century DR, the anchorites of Talos used their magic to send a number of ankhegs to attack a logging camp in Neverwinter Wood , and Drethna was placed in charge of observing whether anyone came to interfere. Rather than to fight, however, she preferred to simply keep watch in her boar shape, and to race off to the anchorite base at the Woodland Manse if she spotted anyone new or suspicious in the forest.</p>
