<p>Windghosts were mysterious flying aberrations possibly native to another plane. They received the name "windghosts" after the creatures' ability to glow with faerie fire in the night skies.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These flying creatures of considerable size were shaped like cones with the larger base ending in the fanged gaping maw. Above the creature's mouth were two large pupilless milky-white eyes. Windghosts had a rough but flexible blotchy skin of gray-purple color. The front of the body had two retractable 4 feet (1.2 meters) to 20 feet (6.1 meters) long tentacle appendages on two sides of the maw.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Windghosts' own language consisted of bird-like chirps, thundering rumbles, and hissings.</p>
<p>Even though alien, puzzling, and frightening, the windghosts were not aggressive creatures. Their appearance and sudden arrival often provoked attacks from scared creatures of the land.</p>
<p>They did not place any value in treasure or magic items.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Windghosts had an ability to lit their eyes and bodies with faerie fire that was easily spottable in the night sky.</p>
<p>Windghosts were immune to the spells and abilities that affected one's mind and were resistant to psionics .</p>
<p>Windghosts had the ability to slowly regenerate . Any and all effects of air magic could only deal half damage to windghosts, and they were not affected by the wind wall spell.</p>
<p>When more than two windghosts were at least 90 feet (27 meters) from each other, they could harmonize emitting a "windsong". That sound made it impossible for anyone who heard it to concentrate enough to read, cast spells, and to hear normal speech. It usually took around 6-12 seconds for the effect to set in. The windsong itself lasted from 6 to 48 seconds, but even if stopped, the effects continue for another 18-42 seconds.</p>
<p>They also could magic shift , arguably their most dangerous ability they eagerly used in combat. On top of that, they possessed spell-like abilities of antimagic field , dispel magic , and spell turning . All available to cast at will.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>The creature's tentacle arms were not used to deal damage, instead, they carried items or hold the opponent.</p>
<p>The battles with windghosts tend to end before they began as the conical aberrations swoop from the skies swallowing their prey whole (medium-sized prey or smaller). The bite damage following the swoop increased against non-fliers and depending on the elevation the creature descended from. If the swooping did not kill the prey outright, windghosts could not repeat the maneuver unless they disengaged and flew back up into the skies. They rarely swooped into combat without surrounding themselves with magical protections beforehand.</p>
<p>If the prey was unfortunate enough to get swallowed, they were swirled inside the stomach's acid. If the prey survived the stomach for longer than 6 seconds, they were regurgitated. The stomach acid could blind the victims.</p>
<p>The windghosts used their most dangerous ability wrapping dweomers (also known as magic shift ) in combat. This ability allowed them to move dead-magic zones placing themselves of the enemy spell-slingers inside. This ability also allowed the windghosts to throw up a barrier of a field that intercepted all incoming magic and redirected it's effect somewhere else, usually back at the spellcaster. This field could only affect one magical effect per 6 seconds, and the windghost could choose which magic to be intercepted and where it was to be redirected.</p>
<p>If overpowered, windghosts fled, flying straight up until safely away from danger.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Windghosts were simultaneous hermaphrodites, bearing both male and female reproductive systems.</p>
<p>These aberrations were unnaturally long-lived and simply spent their time drifting in the winds observing the life below.</p>
<p>Sages believed that windghosts had no natural enemies nor predators. Even though windghosts could consume the creatures they fought, they never attacked for food, instead, they preferred consuming carrion and plants, drinking by submerging in water and absorbing the sun's energy by simply flying through the skies.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Windghosts were a favored monster of the deities Aerdrie Faenya and Shaundakul . The latter was known to send one or more of them to aid his worshipers whenever they were surrounded in the wilderness and making a desperate last stand. Outside of such circumstances, his priests were also occasionally accompanied by them.</p>
<p>Whenever he went hunting in the Beastlands or Ysgard , Shaundakul typically had windghost attendants alongside him.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR , windghosts were seen swimming in the skies over the ruins of Myth Drannor .</p>
