<p>The Well of spells was an itinerant cylinder of magical light that appeared in various caverns throughout Toril . The change from one location to the next depended purely on the will of the deity Mystra .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The well appeared as cylinder of golden light, of varying diameter. It had no top or bottom; any mage who reached the topmost point would appear at the bottom, and vise versa.</p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>The magical effects of the well varied depending on whether or not the person stepping through it was an arcane spellcaster and if it was their first experience. There was no limit to the number of spellcasters that could be in the well at the same time. They could readily speak to and interact with one another, but could not attack or trade at all; their appearance to others within the light was intangible and almost ethereal. Any wizard or mage stepping into the well would levitate and fly within its field at a fairly slow speed. This effect would continue for some time after which the spellcaster would float gently back down to the ground.</p>
<p>If it was their first visit, the caster would face a monster that materialized in the well's center. The mage could choose to flee or engage the beast in combat, during which neither side could use magic or psionic powers. Were a mage to succeed in this battle of brawn they would be granted knowledge of an additional, randomly chosen, spell . Arcane spellcasters who returned to the well for subsequent visits would receive an important, though cryptic, vision of a person, item or location that was paramount to their life.</p>
<p>The well had a different set of effects on non-wizards. They could not perceive the people within its field, only the radiance of its light, and it would not cause them to float. It would, however, cure them of any charm effects, curses , including lycanthropy , and even remove any geases placed upon them.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The well would appear in any size cavern anywhere from the depths of the Underdark to the heart of a mountain peak.</p>
