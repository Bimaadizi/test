<p>Heggr Splitsteel was a dwarven weapon merchant who sold wares in the Underdark in the late 13th and early 14th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Heggr sold wares in the area south of a House Despana camp, near Rilauven . The weapons merchant sold a variety of weapons, included magically enhanced ones.</p>
<p>Heggr set up trade with a derro savant ( Myrvek ) and a drow ( Wode ), despite their races not typically getting along. He made it clear that he wouldn't let "ancient grudges stand in the way of good coin". These mercantile tactics gave his clan the edge in trading. It was noted by Wode, however, that he didn't like being associated with his fellow traders. Furthermore, if he was found out by his clan, he would have been exiled. Despite this, he often engaged in banter with Myrvek and Wode.</p>
<p>The dwarf was particularly religious, being a priest of Abbathor. He didn't like his clan name to be revealed, and would curse those in the name of Abbathor and Clangeddin , if they revealed it. He, himself, was poor at keeping secrets.</p>
<p>Heggr used a warhammer and shield to fight.</p>
