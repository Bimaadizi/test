<p>Nula was the Maztican goddess of animals.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nula was capable of appearing as any kind of animal, but she most often appeared as a wise long-limbed monkey with a sinuous, prehensile tail. Nula showed happiness by loud exhilarated laughter and celebrations, always larger than life. In anger, the goddess screamed and pounded her chest with great face. She was known to have wild swings of emotions that suddenly switched from one extreme to another.</p>
<p>Nula had separate aspects for different categories of animals each. She had an aspect of a carrion-eater, cat , fish , bird , and monstrosities , among many others.</p>
<h2>Divine Realm</h2>
<p>The small realm of Tochitl was Nula's home in the planes. It stood in Asgard , the top layer of Gladsheim . Nula's realms was filled with beasts of all shapes and colors.</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Nula was less important to the Mazticans than the other deities, because the Mazticans did not keep much livestock, and Maztican society was far more dependent on agriculture. Hunters and fishermen would pray to Nula before setting out. No sacrifices were offered to her, save a small offering of seed or bone placed on the ground, and she had few priests.</p>
<p>Nula had Maztican priests and worshipers who venerated her or several gods at the same time. Apart from humans, Nula was worshiped by the jaguar-folk tabaxi , scorpion people tlincalli , and wild halflings of Far Payit . The Little Folk considered Nula to be their prime deity, and the only sacrifices given to her were occasional human trespassers and prisoners. More commonly, Payitlan halflings offered Nula pieces of each creature slain by the hunters as a tithe.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nula came into existence during the Immortal Era of Maztica inhabited by the gods. Kukul , the father of all things, and his wife Maztica bore children that shared their divinity. They birthed Qotal , the Plumed One, followed by Zaltec the Bloody, then the twins Plutoq , Tezca , and Azul were created, followed by daughters â€“ Kiltzi , and later sisters Watil and Nula. After the True World started flourishing, the gods started squabbling. The great war and betrayal arrived when jealous Zaltec slew his mother and her husband Kukul died of grief. Enraged, Qotal battled his younger brother, starting a divine war in which the siblings took sides. Like her older sisters, Nula sided with Qotal. However that alliance did not last on the universal scale of godly time. After Zaltec's first defeat, Qotal grew jealous of love and affection displayed by humans and wanted some of his own. He then took his sister Kiltzi by force. Following this unspeakable act, Kiltzi fled in fear and shame to Zaltec's side. Nula and her sisters followed. Horrified of his deeds and the strife it cause his human subjects, Qotal left Maztica, leaving his bloodthirsty brothers growing their worship among Mazticans.</p>
<p>Following the colonization of Maztica by New Amn and the prophesied return of Qotal, Nula found herself rapidly growing in prominence as the continent welcomed its growing populations of horses , cattle , and pigs , brought from across the ocean.</p>
