<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The city was famous for a common theme in its artistry, carvings of snakes that were plastered with gold leaf.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Phelajarama was located near the source of the waterway later called the River Tesh . After the ruined city was swallowed up by the sands of Anauroch , it remained under the stretch of the desert called At'ar's Looking Glass .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Eleasius of the Year of the Harpist's Delight, −33 DR , Asram was struck by a horrendous plague, an apparent result of the interloper goddess Kiputytto attacking the goddess Talona in the city of Phelajarama. Talona emerged victorious by bringing down her plague upon the city, forcing the inhabitants to offer their prayers, while Kiputytto struck back in a similar manner. Talona's plagues overcame the curative resources of the city, leaving the population dead within a month.</p>
