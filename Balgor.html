<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the army assembled by the Cult of the Absolute moved from the Moonrise Towers in Chionthar Valley to menace the city of Baldur's Gate , displacing countless refugees in the process along the way. However, Sylvie Summerworth was not particularly frightened by the encroaching army. Unlike his friends Sylvie Summerworth and Randalf , Balgor was worried over the looming army. While Sylvie ranted over missing mail, Balgor was annoyed by her caring more about post rather than possible description of Rivington in a war with the Absolute.</p>
