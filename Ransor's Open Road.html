<p>Ransor's Open Road was a caravan outfitter in Triboar in the Dessarin Valley in the mid-to-late 14 th century and late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It lay in the north of the town, between the north caravan campground and Othovir's Harness Shop .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The store sold supplies, animal feed, and gear; sold and exchanged horses and other draft animals; and hired guard services to caravans. Their guards were selected from a roster of ticketed mercenaries who'd come to Triboar looking for work. They were interviewed while being examined by a wizard using ESP to determine their trustworthiness, then granted a certification ticket and lodged in a barracks on site to wait for a client and their place in a job roster. However, these tickets were often sold, swapped, shared, or stolen, so they were not a guarantee.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The business was in operation by the mid-1360s DR.</p>
<p>In the 15 th century DR, the owner of the establishment died and the store was shut down. No business arose to take its place, leaving it abandoned for many years, to become overgrown with weeds and infested with various vermin. Locals removed many of the wooden shingles from its roof, using them to repair their own.</p>
<p>When fire giants assaulted the town after 1485 DR , the shop was finally destroyed in their wake.</p>
