<p>Flymber Bubbins was an aspiring acolyte of the Open Hand Temple of Ilmater located in the city of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Flymber and Homer Bubbins were born some years before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR in the town of Beregost in West Faerûn . At some point, Homer Bubbins set out to pursue a career as a member of the clergy of Ilmater in Baldur's Gate. Despite what he said in his letters, Homer did not become the "right-hand temple manager" under Father Lorgan , but joined the criminal organization known as the Guild . Eventually, in 1492 DR , Flymber Bubbins followed in his twin's footsteps and left Beregost to join the Open Hand Temple. Mama Bubbins happily announced that in her birthday letter to Homer.</p>
