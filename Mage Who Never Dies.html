<p>The Mage Who Never Dies was the mysterious master of the Flooded Forest in the Vast and the Moonsea regions of north Faer√ªn in the late 14 th century DR . The title was given by folk around Ylraphon , but whoever or whatever this being was remained unknown.</p>
<p>The Mage Who Never Dies was said to have claimed the southern part of the Flooded Forest as his domain circa 1370 DR . This included the duskwood forests at its southern edge and the Mage's Tower , with the village of Tavilar lying at the southern border.</p>
<p>Some folk in Ylraphon rumored that certain evil groups and orcs , who regularly stocked up on supplies in Ylraphon before venturing into the Flooded Forest, served the Mage Who Never Dies.</p>
