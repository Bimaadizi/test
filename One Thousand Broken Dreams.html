<p>One Thousand Broken Dreams was a unique magical elven warblade.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>It was a +3 holy drow bane longsword fashioned of mithral .</p>
<p>The sword harmed evil creatures who dared grasp it, weakening them until they set it down.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The sword was thousands of years old by the 14 th century DR . It was made by an elf worshiper of Sehanine Moonbow named Datharian Mistwatcher when his home city was destroyed by the drow . Soon after, Datharian was slain in battle against an army of driders , and the sword passed into other hands.</p>
<p>The sword later fell into the hands of a female elf known only as the Stargazer , and she slew hundreds of drow with it over her lifetime. When she realized her sister had been killed in the Battle of Nine Arrows , she died of grief, whereupon another elf, a young archer, picked up the sword and left before approaching drow reinforcements could claim it.</p>
<p>One Thousand Broken Dreams came into the possession of many different elves since then, typically once every few centuries, before disappearing again.</p>
<h2>Legend</h2>
<p>There was a rumor that if the longsword was ever drawn by a good drow, it would shatter into a thousand moonstones (each worth around 50 gp ). Furthermore, if true, these stones could each be used to cast atonement on a drow and thus redeem them.</p>
