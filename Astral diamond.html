<p>Astral diamonds (abbreviated " ad ") were tiny, glowing crystals that were used as currency on planes of existence with commercial economies in the World Axis cosmology . On Toril , they were regarded as valuable gemstones .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Astral diamonds were clear, faceted gemstones that glowed with a faint silver light. As currency, a standard astral diamond weighed 1/500 th of a pound (0.9 grams)—a tenth as much as a gold piece —and was worth the equivalent of 10,000 gp . They were often traded in sets of 5 or 10 linked together in silver or mithral settings, and were used for large transactions in markets across both the Astral Sea and the Elemental Chaos , including in Sigil and the City of Brass .</p>
<p>Astral diamonds could also be used as decorative elements (e.g., as jewelry or set into items ), as spell components , and to craft lenses .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Astral diamonds occurred within astral dominions , and in particular, they tended to be found in dominions that were inhabited and lively. Mining operations attracted great interest, and abandoned mines often became home to deadly occupants. The richest veins were said to be in places like Mount Celestia . Rough astral diamonds had to be refined before they could be used as currency.</p>
<p>The Nar were known to craft steel "death masks" studded with astral diamonds.</p>
<p>Xorvintrothian artificers created devices that used lenses made of astral diamond. These lenses were tempered in the chaotic energies of Limbo , resulting in an ability to not only focus light but to filter undesirable energies. They were used to charge and to disable Far Realm batteries .</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , astral diamond had been used to create the Fang Light , a magical and eternal beacon that helped to guide ships through the reefs and shoals off the west coast of Aglarond .</p>
