<p>The vundwood was a species of tree that grew throughout Faerûn , particularly abundant in the hills of the Western Heartlands and the Tunlands of Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These scrubby trees were relatively short, rarely growing over 15 feet (4.6 meters) tall. Their wood was reddish-brown in color and smelled somewhat of cinnamon , and were covered in thin, dark-red bark with many small outwardly growing branches. The leaves were pale-green and bordered with white, that turned to yellow when winter was approaching or as the tree neared death.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>These trees were often used as firewood or felled and dragged into tangled arrangements to form pens for livestock.</p>
<p>When vundwood was used in the creation of magical items it imbued them with a sort of arcane echo, whereby they gained extra changes every few months if they were not entirely depleted.</p>
<p>In addition, vundwood served as a universal replacement material component for both arcane and divine spells related to the recalling of expended spells or the augmentation of a spellcaster's magical capacity.</p>
