<h2>History</h2>
<p>Goraun was one of Maerjanthra Shalace's apprentices while she was alive. He was working under her since at least approximately 1351 DR , the birth of Narnra Shalace , who was twenty or twenty-two years old in 1373 DR . At that time, he was a witness to Maerjanthra's plot to bear Elminster Aumar a child, on which she was aided by Khelben Arunsun , who under duress from the goddess Mystra gave her a potion to override Elminster's control over his own fertility. He recounted this to Jonczer.</p>
<p>Shortly after Maerjanthra's death, Goraun disappeared after a break-in killed his fellow apprentice Rorgel .</p>
