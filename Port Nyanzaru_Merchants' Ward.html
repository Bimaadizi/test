<p>The Merchants' Ward of Port Nyanzaru , Chult was home both to many temples and to the grand villa estates of the city's merchant princes . As such, it was considered the city's upper-class district.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Merchants' Ward comprised the western half of the walled portion of Port Nyanzaru, abutting the Harbor Ward to the east. The southern portion of the ward was an open space dominated by the Grand Souk , a huge covered marketplace. Much of the rest of the Merchants' Ward was built on and around two steep hills: Temple Hill to the north and Throne Hill in the center if the ward. A wide stone bridge atop arched columns connected the tops of these two hills, while a second bridge spanned above the Grand Souk to connect the hilltop to the slopes of the southern mountain overlooking the city, where several merchant princes' villas were located. Access to these hilltops was restricted by walls and gates.</p>
<p>The ward was characterized by decorative banners and elaborate stonework.</p>
