<h2>Membership</h2>
<p>To be invited to join, a prospective member must have achieved some noteworthy feat and have it recognized by the society's committee.

Despite providing financial support for the expeditions of the legitimate members, these individuals, referred to by Artus Cimber as "Warts" rather than Stalwarts, diminished the prestige of the society.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Society of Stalwart Adventurers was founded around the 2 nd century DR by Dhalmass Rayburton and four other members. However, Dhalmas later confessed to Artus Cimber that he'd just allowed the use of his name to the original founders of the society.</p>
