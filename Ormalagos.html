<p>Ormalagos , also known as Needle , was an adult green dragon who was killed by a tribe of batiri goblins in Chult .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Per Sammaster , the nickname "Needle" was an allusion to her skills in torture: she keep creatures in states of incredible pain for hours using only her claws, despite her size. She was also capable of casting spells, most likely ice darts and shadow spray .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On Uktar 9 of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , she was in the Gray Forest near Impiltur , accompanied by the black dragon Dransagalor ; while in the throes of a nascent Rage of Dragons , she attacked Sammaster and Cylla Morieth . The lich responded by casting a abate dracorage to calm the rage, and then offering her the transformation into a dracolich in return for her help in running a local enclave of the Cult of the Dragon . She did not refuse at the time.</p>
<p>Ormalagos kept her lair in Chult, in the sinkhole that would come to be known as Needle's Bones . She rightly suspected her lair had been discovered by batiri raiders, and was in the process of moving her hoard to a new lair when the goblins struck. While she was away, they filled the murky water at the bottom of the sinkhole with masses of quippers , and upon her return, trapped her inside using vine nets. Caught between the quippers eating her from below, and the batiri pelting her with spears from above, Ormalagos eventually died, but not before killing nearly the entire goblin tribe.</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, a pair of legendary claw-like weapons existed in Chult. These Needle's Rest claws were believed to had been crafted using claws of Ormalagos herself.</p>
