<p>Homer Bubbins , better known as the Bad Twin Bubbins , was a halfling member of The Guild from the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Homer Bubbins was born in the town of Beregost in West Faerûn . At some point, Homer Bubbins pursued a religious career in the Open Hand Temple of Ilmater in Baldur's Gate. Or, at least, that was what Mama Bubbins believed. Homer wrote letters home, continuing the charade, claiming to serve and live happily under Father Lorgan and even claiming to have reached the title of the "right-hand temple manager." In reality, the man known as the "Bad Twin Bubbins" joined the infamous Guild.</p>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Homer's twin brother, Flymber Bubbins , became inspired by his brother's lies and decided to move to Baldur's Gate and join the Open Hand Temple, as reported by Mama Bubbins in a birthday letter to her prodigal son.</p>
<p>Homer Bubbins was present at The Guild's Guildhall in Baldur's Gate's Undercellar during the Absolute crisis of 1492 DR and an attempt by the Zhentarim to seize control of the weakened criminal cartel. However, Bad Twin Bubbins's survival past the tumult of these two conflicts remains unconfirmed.</p>
