<p>Half-dwarves (also known as halfbloods ) were hybrid humanoids born through the union of a dwarf and another humanoid race. Half-dwarves of dwarf-elf hybridization were sometimes more specifically called dwelves ( sing : dwelf ).</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Biologically, half-dwarves were almost indistinguishable from dwarves, except that half-dwarves were slightly taller. They were not considered a distinct race.</p>
<p>The physical and mental characteristics inherited by dwelves varied between individuals. This meant that some dwelves had more elvish characteristics and some had more dwarven characteristics.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Half-dwarves were usually the result of a dwarf mating with a human , gnome , elf , or halfling .</p>
<p>The fertility and offspring of half-dwarves was similar to that of half-elves . If a half-dwarf mated with a pureblood dwarf, the offspring would be a pureblood dwarf. If a half-dwarf mated with another half-dwarf or a nondwarf, the offspring would be a half-dwarf.</p>
<h3>Culture</h3>
<p>Like half-elves, dwelves would adopt the cultures and gods of whoever raised them.</p>
<p>Non-dwarven mates who entered into dwarven culture were honored and respected by dwarves for their bravery and loyalty.</p>
<h2>Homelands</h2>
<p>Half-dwarf races were common in Ardeep , Eaerlann , and Myth Drannor at one point in history but by 1358 DR were unheard of.</p>
