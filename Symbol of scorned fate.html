<p>Symbols of scorned fate were special types of Tymoran holy symbols of various power levels imbued with the Lady Luck's divine magics. These symbols first started being used by the Church of Tymora post- Spellplague .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Symbols of scorned fate were shaped like double-headed coins .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These holy symbols were enchanted to allow their wielders to elude fate for a split second. When the owner of a symbol of scorned fate was affected by a spell effect, the double-headed coin's magic was activated. It protected the owner from said negative effect for a short period of time, thus cheating fate. This power needed some time to recharge. Additionally, these magic coins enchanted the wielder's combat prowess, by improving their aim and damage output. Additionally, the wielder seared the targets of their strikes with Tymora's divine radiance.</p>
