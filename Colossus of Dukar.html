<p>The Colossus of Dukar was a gigantic monument in the underwater city of Myth Nantar depicting the near-mythical triton of the same name , the first Grand Master of the Dukars , an ancient Serôsian order of wizards .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Colossus stood within the Dukar Quarter of Myth Nantar, next to the Dukars' Academy , with its legs straddling the entrance to Dukar's tomb.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This statue stood 90 feet (27 meters) tall, making it the tallest structure in the city. It was completely carved from lucent coral , which naturally gave off a bright glow and thus made the Colossus the source of one-fourth of all light in Myth Nantar. It depicted Dukar with his legendary Grandmaster's Tapal raised overhead in his right arm.</p>
<p>The Colossus was notably the site of one of the few portals within the city that the dukar Qos would freely divulge to anyone. This hidden portal opened to the former gates of the city of Akhanmyr and in order to activate it one had to swim in a loop around the Colossus's head three times before swimming straight upwards.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In −168 TS (−238 DR) , a group of dukar of the Jhimari and Numos orders went rogue, wanting to transform Myth Nantar into their own city-state by the name of Nantarum. Sometime later around −150 TS (−220 DR) , on the day the merfolk king Ristan laid siege against them, the thirty rogue dukars were standing around the Colossus of Dukar as the city's mythal let off bursts of magical energy. The dukars were later found by the attackers to have been petrified into coral statues, lining the avenue leading to the Dukars' Academy, their faces frozen with looks of contrition.</p>
<p>On Marpenoth 30 , 1369 DR , when Iakhovas and his forces launched an assault upon the city of Myth Nantar the Oghmanyte bard Pacys stood atop the Colossus of Dukar, overlooking the battle. From there he played upon his instrument saceddar , singing a ballad he had written for Myth Nantar's defenders to magically inspire them.</p>
<p>Late in the year 1370 DR , among the thirty petrified dukars a sea elf of the Order of Jhimar by the name of Radom mysteriously returned to life, leaving only twenty-nine petrified dukars around the Colossus.</p>
