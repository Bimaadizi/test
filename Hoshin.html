<p>Hoshin was a shukenja adventurer in Kozakura .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hoshin's early history was shrouded in mystery: some said he was a samurai fleeing his household after a love affair with a clan rival's daughter; he was a pirate and the only survivor after a shipwreck; he was an impostor searching for a good hiding spot for illegal activities as a yakuza or ninja; or he might be an illegitimate son of the shogun . The only clear fact was that as a young man he presented himself at the gate of the Floating Cloud Monastery , a temple following the Way of Enlightenment philosophy. He remembered nothing from before that time.</p>
<p>Hoshin often traveled Kozakura spreading the teachings of the Way of Enlightenment. One of his goals was to go to Shou Lung to visit the birthplace of Way of Enlightenment.</p>
<p>In 1357 DR , Hoshin was among the candidates considered by Ko Mei Kho for a mission in Akari .</p>
<p>In 1358 DR , Hoshin was traveling to Shou Lung to visit the Cliffs of Tanghai when he was possibly approached by Ko Ho San .</p>
