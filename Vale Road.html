<p>The Vale Road was the primary route leading north out of Hulburg on the Moonsea , and connected the city to the farming community of Winterspear Vale and to Thar beyond.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The road originated in Hulburg. It passed through Harmach's Foot , a square in Old Hulburg , on its way north out of town. As it left the city, it turned east rather than cross at the Burned Bridge , the junction with Keldon Way , and remained on the eastern side of the Winterspear River heading north into the farmlands of Winterspear Vale.</p>
<p>After about 3 miles (4.8 kilometers), the road passed through a narrow gap in Lendon's Dike as it neared Lake Hul . Rounding the lake, the road forked at an old dairy farm, with the road to Glister heading west into Thar and a cart track heading east and north into the Highfells to Garumn's Climb through the Galena Mountains to Vaasa .</p>
