<p>The black obelisks were a series of magical artifacts originating from ancient Netheril that possessed various forms of incredible power, including the potential for time travel .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The obelisks were said to be otherworldly in appearance, described as being formed from either obsidian , a polished rune -covered black stone, or a type of unidentified black metal. The monolithic devices were formed to gradually narrow from a wide base, to a pyramid-shaped peak in a range of different heights. Different obelisks were created in a variety of sizes, anywhere from 15 ft (4.6 m) to even 50 ft (15 m) and 60 ft (18 m) tall.</p>
<p>At least in one instance, it was observed that any shard broken off from an obelisk would be somehow "absorbed" back into the whole by merely touching it to the surface.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The most notable and powerful power associated with the obelisks was the ability to alter time and reality. An individual could merely reverse the age of every nearby being by a decade's time, or even go so far as to transport an entire world thousands of years in the past within their timeline. Full activation of these powers required another powerful artifact with magical charges that seemingly had to be keyed into an obelisk, as was the instance with the staff of power belonging to the arcanist Iriolarthas .</p>
<p>The obelisks radiated auras of arcane energy, often in the form of abjuration magic. A spellcaster could readily tap into this energy to teleport themself and anyone else touching the device to a random location. These teleportation powers were known to have been linked to an "ebon pool" of black ooze and small, corresponding black marbles.</p>
<p>More than one obelisk was known to harbor a powerful extra-planar creature within its form, including a nalfeshnee , and even a couatl called Tezca-Zyanya .</p>
<p>They were seemingly unaffected by energies from the Far Realm , and were observed to elicit some form of reaction from the faerzress that permeated the caverns of the Underdark .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The predecessor of the Netherese obelisks were those created by an enigmatic group of spellcasters known as the Weavers . These were capable of altering time and reality on a grand scale, effectively working as a safeguard in the case a truly catastrophic event was brought upon their place of origin. At some point in time the Oerthian being Vecna procured one of these obelisks, along with the specifications of their creation, and used it to remove the artifacts creators from existence.</p>
<p>The information regarding the obelisks' creation eventually found its way to Netherese arcanists , who built the Faerûnian variety that could still be found millennia after their empire's demise . While the obelisks ultimately failed to save Netheril in the known world, several of them were stolen or otherwise recovered, and hidden away in remote locations throughout the Realms.</p>
<p>Some time after the Year of the Iron Dwarf's Vengeance, 1485 DR , cloud giants from a floating castle stole the obelisk from its namesake town of Nightstone on the Sword Coast North , believing it to be a relic of ancient Ostoria .</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Knowledge of the obelisks, along with their function and creation were wholly lost to time on the planet of Toril .</p>
