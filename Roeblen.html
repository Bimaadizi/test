<p>Roeblen of Bezantur , or Roeblen of Thay , was a Red Wizard of Thay in the mid-14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>He had hair and beard cut and oiled to a razor sharp shape, and thick, powerful fingers.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The man was easily amused, making rude gestures in the mirror when by himself. He was also intensely arrogant.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He had created a Sword of feebleminding and distributed two trapped crystal balls . He'd also managed to snatch a Staff of Silverymoon from Alustriel in 1369 DR ; during his fight with her, he carried an amulet that protected him against magic missile , almost certainly a brooch of shielding .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Beyond the magic implied by the devices he'd created, he employed fireball , wall of force , disintegrate , a relatively simple spell to open doors, likely knock , and a transmuting spell that converted one of his arms into a deadly, reptilian, snaking thing about fifty feet long with claws strong enough to sever an arm, leaving wounds that quickly covered themselves with reptilian scales.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was part of a strange cycle-teleporting effect that allowed him to trade locations with fellow Red Wizard Thaltar Glaervar , but in return, he was bound to do the same whenever called on by Azmyrandyr , with little warning time. This cycle had been forced upon him as part of his participation in an extensive cabal; linked into the same cycle were Auvrarn Labraster and an especially large umber hulk .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR , Roeblen answered a call from Azmyrandyr, who employed a teleporting link to swap himself out of a fight against Alustriel Silverhand and thus escape from Silverymoon , where he'd been summoned by an umber hulk, who had in turn been called by the merchant Auvrarn Labraster, whom Alustriel believed to be hiding information regarding a murder. He did not get much time to prepare, and was barely able to snatch up his sword of feebleminding . Though he skewered her with it, it barely slowed her down.</p>
<p>He then hurled a fireball at the roof to create suppressive debris, and tried to open a door, but was unable to break Alustriel's extant ward on the doors with his magic. Seeing Taern Hornblade and an elf join the fray, he guarded himself with a wall of force ; Alustriel's magic missile entered from above the ring-shaped force, but he took no damage thanks to an amulet. He disintegrated the wall rather than dismiss it, and then attacked with a different spell that converted one of his arms into a horrifying 50-foot snaking thing with immense claws. He managed to slice off Alustriel's arm with it, and the wound immediately became covered with snake scales as a side effect. He was able to wrest Alustriel's staff of Silverymoon from her, but thanks to a fleshfire spell she cast, his arm quickly became covered in flames; he called on the cycle to swap out for Thaltar Glaervar , tapping out of the fight.</p>
<p>Later, the Simbul slew him through his link to a trapped crystal ball of his' that allowed him to spy on the user. She slew also the Red Wizard Irlmarren , whom he was spying on: she shaped a spell that paralyzed them both, making smoke come out of their eyes, and then decapitated them by making the trapped balls explode. From her comments, this wasn't the first she'd heard of him.</p>
