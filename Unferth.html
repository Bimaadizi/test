<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The priest and his partner Ghald were the Kraken Society's top operatives in this part of the North , specialized in advancing the agenda of the society through theft, intimidation, and assassination. He was usually the spokesman but Ghald was in command.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1491 DR , a patrol of the Twelve near Triboar had defeated some cultists of the Cult of the Eternal Flame and recovered a devastation orb . They went back to Yartar with the orb, but just after they put it in the city's vaults, Nareen Dhest stole it. After examining it, the Hands of Yartar decided to sell it in an auction at the Wink and Kiss tavern.</p>
<p>Hearing this news, Ghald and Unferth decided that the Society needed the orb, so they formed a partnership with Haliyra Ravenfast to obtain it.</p>
<p>Ghald, Unferth, and some minions waited in a tomb near the tavern but the intervention of some adventurers ruined their plan and Ghald and Unferth were defeated.</p>
