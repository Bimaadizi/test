<p>Zhai was a half- drow , halfâ€“ wood elf rogue of the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Zhai seemed to be a lone wolf who dismissive toward others and more comfortable with working by herself, something which stemmed from her mixed heritage which made her difficult to fit in among wood elves of Cedarleaf. Even so, she would go out of her way to help her home community without hesitation, even allowing Rannek and Illius to help her defending it from Cireka and Ygorl's raid.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>She was able to use twin daggers and had skill at hiding herself.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Zhai was raised in the wood elf village of Cedarleaf by her drow mother and wood elf father, until they were killed indirectly by the slaad Ygorl in a raid against the town.</p>
<p>Feeling insecure in the home of the wood elves, Zhai left them and became a rogue. She was captured by orcs attacking a town but was freed by Rannek during the battle. Soon thereafter, Zhai acquired a ring of jumping .</p>
<p>Zhai later gained a reputation in Damara around 1368 DR , with Ellery Dragonsbane hearing tales of her and mentioning them to Jarlaxle Baenre .</p>
