<p>Sode was a type of armor used in Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The sode was a protective armor that shielded the wearer's shoulder. Typically square or rectangular in shape, it measured approximately 1 square foot (930 square centimeters). The sode was securely attached to other armor pieces, particularly the corselet, using cords. As a result, it could not be worn independently and necessitated the presence of the do-maru , hara-ate , haramaki , or haramaki-do .</p>
<p>During battles, it was not uncommon to tie a piece of cloth known as the sode jiruchi over the sode. This cloth was often dyed or painted with a distinctive emblem or badge that identified the wearer.</p>
