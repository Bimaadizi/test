<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Raman typically wore dark brown and blue clothing, to contrast with the pale colored clothes that his brother preferred. Though sometimes he swapped outfits with his brother to confuse others.</p>
<p>On his person, Raman Byrrd wore his magical bracers of defense and was armed with an enchanted dagger . The brothers also owned a spelljammer ship.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was very close with his twin brother, and the two would sometime imitate each other to confuse outsiders.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The most notable event in Reman and Ramen's lives was their father's mysterious disappearance that was punctuated by the transfer of ownership of a spelljammer ship. Sceptical of their father's claim of a flying ship they were shocked to receive it upon a desolate mountain peak, not wishing to sell the last item their father purred the family fortune into, they decided instead to turn the magical vessel into an amusement ride.</p>
