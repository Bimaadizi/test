<p>Sheik Jolarr was the leader of a tribe of magic -hunting Bedine warriors that wandered the sands of the Anauroch desert during the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Despite his destructive goals in life, Jolarr was quite the honorable man. He only considered spellcasters among the people with whom he held true enmity.</p>
<p>Jolarr was a skilled outdoorsman, expert rider, and master swordsman when he held blades in each hand. He was particularly adept at hunting down and slaying members of the Zhentarim .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As the leader of 300 Bedine, Jolarr led raids against Zhentarim camps, rogue spellcasters, and magical creatures they encountered in the desert. Ironically, the tribe made use of a handful of sorcerers who were adept at counterspelling but never cast offensive magic. There were no clerics under Jolarr's leadership, and spiritual worship was fulfilled free of the Power .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Due to his magic-hating nature, Jolarr kept no enchanted items , but rather kept a pair of masterwork blades , a saber , and a short sword .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When he was was a young boy, Jolarr's tribe launched a raid on a Zhentarim caravan and met stiff resistance. While the rest of the youth of the tribe stayed in the back of the conflict as observers, they were nearly ensnared by the wizards of the Black Network, but managed to retreat. Unfortunately, Jolarr's father was not so lucky and died by a dark spell cast by another magic-wielding Zhent .</p>
<p>Jolarr grew to both fear and detest magic, taking up the life of a forsaker , and united his tribe under this hatred. Under his leadership they transformed from a peaceful nomadic tribe into a ferocious army that sought out and destroyed Zhentarim forces, delivering extremely brutal deaths to their mages and acolytes. This zealotry extended beyond the dark organization, and they began to hunt down other arcane practitioners, including fellow Bedine spellcasters, and magical beasts such as lamias , and they destroyed any constructs they encountered, such as the numerous portal s that dotted the sands of the Anauroch desert.</p>
<p>On one occasion, Jolarr and his raiders stalked the lamia noble sorcerer Koreeis and their lamia clan into the Netherese ruins of Hlaungadath , but were halted by the presence of dark magic.</p>
