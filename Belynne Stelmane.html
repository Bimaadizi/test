She was left in a coma for several days while she and the aberration engaged in a psychic battle for control of her mind. Though she was able to conduct business for the Knights of the Shield for some time, she continued to struggle to merely control her body and mind for over a decade, well into the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR .</p>
<p>During the rise of the the Absolute that same year, she was murdered by Bhaalists in the Elfsong Tavern in the Lower City . She was paralyzed with crawler mucus and stabbed thirty six times, with the cause of death being blood loss.
