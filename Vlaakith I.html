<p>Vlaakith I , also known as the Lich-Queen , was the second prolific leader of the gith people, and the first of at least one-hundred-fifty-seven rulers of the same title. She began the millennia-long dynasty of undead queens that ruled over the war-hungry githyanki of the Astral Plane .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>While she proved an adept leader, ever-efficient in her manipulations, Vlaakith I was a wholly treacherous individual. She held no true loyalty to her allies, and over time continued to serve only her own selfish interests.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She was once the most trusted advisor of Gith , the singular individual after which both the githyanki and githzerai peoples were named.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Vlaakith I emerged notable among the gith people when they rebelled against the ancient Illithid Empire , under the leadership of Gith. To garner allies in their struggle, Vlaakith I first attempted to negotiate with Dispater , the archdevil of Dis , but ultimately proved unsuccessful. Vlaakith I did however compel Gith to descend into the Nine Hells and meet with Ephelomon , consort to Tiamat , the evil queen of the chromatic dragons . A pact between the two powers was forged: red dragons were granted to the gith warriors, while Gith herself would remain in the Nine Hells. Vlaakith I would rule over the gith people for a time, until Gith herself would one day return to the Prime. The pact was upheld, and many red dragons served Gith's descendents for millenium that followed. Vlaakith would, as Gith supposedly decreed: "Carry on the Eternal Crusade" in her name.</p>
<p>As Gith was forced to enter negotiations on behalf of her people by herself, it appeared to the gith people she had perished. In truth however, Gith sacrificed herself for her peoples' success and continued freedom. Vlaakith meanwhile was given the opportunity needed to seize power for herself. Over time, Vlaakith I began to view herself as a divine being and banned worship of all other entities.</p>
<p>Gith's son Orpheus was one of the few aware that Vlaakith had betrayed the rebel-queen. He led Gith's honor guard in a second rebellion against Vlaakith I. This conflict came to be known as the War of the Comet . While Orpheus and Gith loyalists fought with terrible ferocity, the True Heir was bested by Kith'rak Voss and imprisoned within the Astral Prism .</p>
<p>After the complete ascendance of Vlaakith I as their leader, there emerged a rift between opposing factions of the gith people. Zerthimon emerged as a powerful spiritual leader who led the emergent githzerai , while Vlaakith I led the githyanki to the Astral Plane , where they founded the city of Tu'narath atop the remains of The One in the Void .</p>
<p>Having crushed their immortal foes, Vlaakith realized the war-hungry githyanki people required a singular purpose to keep them united. She made the 'grand proclamation' that the githyanki must be recognized as the true rulers of the Prime Material Plane. Each world within would be theirs for the taking, to shape and remold as she saw fit. Any githyanki warrior that proved themselves in battle could themselves achieve 'ascension', and be welcomed to her divine court.</p>
