<p>Flink Thunderbonk was a deep gnome apprentice wizard of Blingdenstone in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Flink was an apprentice wizard of Yantha Coaxrock , leader of the Stoneheart Enclave in Blingdenstone. He went with his mistress to Mantol-Derith around 1486 DR , but there Yantha argued with Krimgol Muzgardt , a duergar merchant, about Fraz-Urb'luu 's gem.</p>
<p>Flink, also influenced by the madness spread by the demon lord through the gem, hid it, and went to the drow section to buy some spell components he believed Yantha needed. There, however, a gargoyle guard stole the gem from him. He remained hidden in the drow section in order to find the gargoyle and recover the gem.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The arrival of the demon lord inflicted him with a madness that caused him to both want to please his mistress and greatly fear her.</p>
