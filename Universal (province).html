<p>In the Zakharan tradition of magic , the universal province encompassed a number of spells that were not specific to the four elemental provinces of sand , sea , wind , and flame . Universal spells could be learned by all Zakharan sorcerers and elemental mages , no matter their specialization. The universal province is not to be confused with the much narrower range of universal spells that were not considered part of any of the schools of magic distinguished by Faer√ªnian magic-users.</p>
<p>All magic users in Zakhara could use universal spells. Due to the land's unique form of magic, Ajami (foreign wizards) were only capable of universal spells even if an equivalent spell existed elsewhere. For example, the Zakharan fireball was based on the elemental "flame" magic unique to the Land of Fate . Only alien elementalists could learn spells from the equivalent Zakharan element. To learn other forms of Zakharan magic, they had to first give up their outland traditions at the cost of permanently losing access to all the spells that they learned before.</p>
