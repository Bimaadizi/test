<p>Segarrans were humanoid –animal hybrid servants of the savage goddess Ragarra that could be found in the jungles of east Zakhara . They were created through priestly spells and came in two distinct sub-species.</p>
<h2>Lesser Segarrans</h2>
<h2>Greater Segarrans</h2>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>The great bay adjacent to Zakhara's greatest expanse of forest, the Jungle of Monsters , was called the Segara Sea (though not in Midani ). It is unclear if the similarity of the name to the segarrans was accidental.</p>
