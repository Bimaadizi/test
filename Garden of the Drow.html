The retreat strongly resembled dwarven design, likely indicating it's origins with the Clan Melairkyn , later taken over by the drow . The Garden's entrance was hidden behind a gate , guaranteeing seclusion and privacy to its occupants. The main entrance to the complex was accentuated by a large decorative planter seeded with various mushrooms that could cause nausea and dizziness if consumed.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Even past its prime, the retreat's interior showed aged luxury and a well-planned layout; past the main entrance, the building sprawled into numerous halls and rooms. The main banquet hall was decorated with old but well-made furniture. Behind the banquet hall, numerous private sitting areas could be found.

However, some of the unique plantlike remained, including the famous crystal roses. The Garden emanated quiet and relaxation even when the area was infested with monsters or taken over by the drow .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Garden of the Drow was likely part of Melairbode and with the final dwarf survivors of the Clan Melairkyn abandoning the settlement, was taken by the drow who transformed it into a secluded, serene monastic retreat for their kind. Following Halaster Blackcloak 's arrival to Undermountain, the drow abandoned the complex to the dungeon's dangers and monsters.</p>
<p>By 1370 DR , the Garden was relatively spared by the ravages of time and subterranean critters. When Matron Azurna brought her evil alliance to Undermountain, the Gardens became one of the strongholds of the drow on the Dungeon Level. Azurna knew that centuries ago, Halaster hid one of the spider statue fragments inside the complex, and the drow were attempting to recover the item. During that time, a love-stricken young noble from Waterdeep descended into Undermountain, searching for one of the crystal roses that grew inside. Asborn Moonstar was able to sneak past the drow into the central garden chamber, and that's where he was trapped. The cruel drow watched the youth starve to death inside the beautiful and serene Garden.</p>
<p>Soon after the young Moonstar's death, one of Khelben Arunsun 's agents discovered his corpse and pushed drow elves out of the stronghold. He left Asborn's body in the Garden and retrieved a crystal rose for his grieving fianc√©, and found the hidden spider piece . The Garden of the Drow was without occupants once more.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, apart from the drow who briefly occupied the retreat, many rooms were infested with giant beetles , giant and mundane rats , and other minor pests.</p>
