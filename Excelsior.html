<p>Excelsior was a gate-town leading to Mount Celestia from the Outlands .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Excelsior was one of the few gate-towns without a city wall. The bricks comprising both the buildings and roads of Excelsior were yellow, speckled with particles of enchanted silver and steel , which emanated a glowing light. The buildings also radiated a natural warmth. This made the city famous in the Outlands.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of city walls, Excelsior was far from defenseless. Orbiting around the city were up to a dozen floating fortresses called picket keeps. Each keep housed a paladin lord and their retinue.</p>
<h3>Gates</h3>
<p>The Gate to Mount Celestia was located at the top of the highest tower of Excelsior. The interior of the tower was a twisting maze of staircases. Most ended at an observation deck, from where an individual had a clear view of the gate-towns of Fortitude and Tradegate . Only one staircase led to the Gate. Those who ascended to a certain height suddenly discovered themselves suspended in midair, 20 feet (6.1 meters) above the ocean, right at the foot of Mount Celestia.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Excelsior was ruled by the High Chancellor. Occasionally, one of the paladin lords issued a challenge to become the new High Chancellor. A short but bloody battle between the paladin lord and their followers versus the High Chancellor's forces would determine the winner of the challenge.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The residents of this gate-town were calm and pleasant. Its population, mostly paladins, was composed primarily of humans and a few archons and devas . Only visitors of good alignment were truly welcome. Any others were not explicitly asked to leave as long as no law was broken, but were regarded with suspicion at all times.</p>
