<p>A sword was a melee weapon that in its simplest form consisted of a blade and a hilt. This definition includes those weapons that fit the archetype of blade with the additional restriction of a minimum size. For game purposes, weapons are divided into three size/weight classes: light, one-handed, and two-handed. All swords are in either the one-handed or the two-handed class (or both) with the exception of the shortsword which is classified as a light weapon. It is included here mainly because of its widespread use and because it is used by smaller races in the same fashion as the other swords are used by larger races.</p>
