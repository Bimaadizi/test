<p>Duar's Retiring Room was a room in Castle Obarskyr in Suzail , Cormyr , in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1479Â DR , during the aftermath of the massacre during the Council of the Dragon in late Mirtul of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the undead Highknight Targrael borrowed an enchanted gemstone from Duar's Retiring Room, which she believed would be eventually spotted. This implied the room was patrolled with some regularity.</p>
