<p>The Wheloon Prison boat was a large boat that was used by Har Pornoth and Frolo Sledge to transport prisoners for the Wheloon Prison .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The boat had a wide, flat deck and a single mast with a sail. The ship's wheel at the rear was covered with an open-sided pavilion to keep the elements off. Cargo (or passengers) were loaded into the lower deck through a hatch in the deck.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Har and Frolo used the vessel for running cargo, but later took up prisoner transportation between Eveningstar and Wheloon . At one point in the late 15 th century DR , they transported Magistrate Barthold Moncrief and his prize prisoner, Dedryk Black , along with a team of Purple Dragons for security. While encamped for the night on the shore of the Wyvernflow not too far from the destination, the group was attacked by lizardfolk led by the shaman Srass Marnanr , who had been hired by the Shadovar to rescue Dedryk. Thanks to the assistance of adventurers , the raiders were dispatched and Dedryk recovered intact.</p>
