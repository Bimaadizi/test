<p>The Wight on a Waterdragon was a restaurant in Marsember , Cormyr .</p>
<p>It took its name from the sculpture on the roof, shaped into a wight riding a creature like a blue dragon but with fins instead of legs. It was carved in Marsember itself by Jathoom Berl .</p>
<p>The building was formerly used for fish packing and thus still smelled of fish. It was filled with makeshift furniture but enjoyed good business nonetheless. It served Purple Dragon and Shadowdark ales, zzar , and a homebrew liquor known as Harbor Bottom . Food consisted of a choice of cheeses from across the Inner Sea , a seafood pie made with a variety of seafood and potatoes , a selection of sauces, pâté and a selection of roasts.</p>
