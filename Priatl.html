<p>Priatl was one of the three leaders of the Azatl settlement in Nexal in 1362 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Priatl ruled over the territory alongside the human quarter and the human market. In his territory's restricted areas, humans must be killed on sign.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Priatl was a kind of religious fanatic. He believed that they lived in a new world where the Viperhands would rule over humans. He believed Jeordros a fool and Michitl too weak, so in his mind he was the best candidate to be leader of all Azatl.</p>
