<p>Dwarvenhome was a shield dwarf realm beneath the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Dwarvenhome comprised vast natural caverns and long tunnels spanning beneath the southern Moonshaes. The caverns were filled with long stalactites and glowing fungi that illuminated the area in an eerie green light.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>From its northernmost exit, Dwarvenhome spanned from the Fairheight Range on the island of Alaron and extended south beneath the Dernall Forest and the town of Codfin to run below the Strait of Alaron to the Taeya Bog on the northern shore of Gwynneth near the Winterglen forest. Some tunnels may have also connected all the way to Highhome on Gwynneth. The tunnels had multiple outlets, including one just south of Codfin and two primary exits on the coast of Gwynneth, and it took several days to travel through the tunnels from one island to another.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dwarvenhome was established circa −8000 DR after dwarven refugees from the Mindstalker Wars became cut off from their homes in Shanatar , and thus began exploring the remote Underdark passages beneath the Sea of Swords . They would eventually settle in the caverns that came to be known as Dwarvenhome.</p>
<p>Dwarven settlers would subsequently establish the realm of Highhome in the Cambro Mountains of Gwynneth (then the domain of the fey realm of Sarifal ) circa −7000 DR , and would subsequently clash in an extended war with a tribe of giants that they dubbed the " fir-bolg ". This only ended circa −5000 DR when the dwarves imprisoned the giants' leader, Grond Peaksmasher , beneath Oman's Isle .</p>
<p>When Kazgoroth first attacked the Moonshae Isles circa −2000 DR , the dwarves allied with the Llewyrr elves to drive back the Beast's forces, notably the fomorians of Vor Thomil who enslaved the firbolg and once again drove them to fight the dwarves. After many decades, the dwarves and elves were victorious.</p>
<p>Following the events of the Darkwalker War in the mid–14 th century DR , the forces of Dwarvenhome mustered against the threat of dark dwarves who had appeared in the Moonshaes.</p>
<p>Following the return of the fey of Sarifal to Gwynneth in the late 14 th century DR, the dwarves of that island came under attack by evil fey led by fomorians and spriggans . , and were forced to all but abandon Highhome save for a small group of cragwardens who stayed behind to defend it. Notably, Clan Rustfire were chased by the evil fey through the Dwarvenhome Tunnels all the way to northern Alaron, where they allied with Clan Rookoath . By the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , these clans also contended with a coalition of orcs , trolls , and shadow creatures led by a shadow dragon who sought to dislodge them from the Fairheight Range. By the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , the dwarves had gained the upper hand in this conflict.</p>
