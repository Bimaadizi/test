<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the Gorion's Ward found himself and his companions in the City of Coin. Eventually, their paths crossed with the Harpers of the city. Harper agent Rylock allowed Abdel Adrian into the Galvarey Estate, where Meronia greeted visitors to the Harper Hold. It was believed that the Bhaalspawn ended up working for Harper Berinvar . Subsequently, the high-ranking Harper Galvarey may have attempted to imprison the Gorion's Ward out of fear of his godly parentage.
