<p>Minter was a thief of the Moonclaws gang of Hastarl in the early 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Minter was part of the Moonclaws team that attempted to burgle the room to which Peeryst Trumpettower and Nanue Glarmeir retired for marital activities on their wedding night in the Year of the Black Flame, 229 DR , only to encounter the Velvet Hands , a rival band, already at work. He got knocked out of the ensuing tussle early.</p>
<p>To Farl's appreciation, he was likely dead, captured, or otherwise no longer fit to practice thievery in the aftermath.</p>
