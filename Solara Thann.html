<p>Solara "Sinker" Thann was a giantslayer and paladin who roamed around the Savage Frontier in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Solara preferred to fight her foes up close, but was willing to hang back when necessary in order to let one of the traps devised by her ally Lai Antolio do its job.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time after the shattering of the Ordning in 1485 DR , the Savage Frontier became a hotbed of squabbling giant activity. Having sworn an oath to protect the natural order of things, Solara felt it was her duty to protect against this rising threat by becoming a giantslayer. To this end, she eventually joined up with two other adventurers to form a giantslayer organization â€” Hook, Line, and Sinker .</p>
