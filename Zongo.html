<p>Zongo was a triceratops owned by Faroul and Gondolo , a pair of hapless jungle guides operating out of Port Nyanzaru , Chult during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Zongo was slow-moving and notably flatulent.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Zongo was sold to Faroul and Gondolo as a racer for competing in Port Nyanzaru's dinosaur races . However, upon realizing that Zongo was hopelessly slow, they realized that it was only useful as a beast of burden. This became something of a boon after the pair ran out of money and sought work as jungle guides because they could claim that their fee included a triceratops to help haul supplies.</p>
