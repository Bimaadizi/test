<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the city of Baldur's Gate was threatened by the encroaching army of the Cult of the Absolute . The crisis flooded the city with refugees, elevating tensions among its citizens and allowing a new power to take rulership of the city â€“ Lord Gortash . Flant Borlley eagerly consumed the new lord's propaganda from the curbside preachers and from the pages of the Baldur's Mouth Gazette. Augur Harxkellan was a Gortash loyalist whose words attracted Flant's attention as he worshiped Enver Gortash, thinking him to be an underappreciated genius.</p>
