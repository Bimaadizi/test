<p>The Moon Women were a group of Lesser Immortals of the Celestial Bureaucracy , the dominant faith of Kara-Tur .</p>
<p>They had the great responsibility of maintaining Heaven itself. They refilled the oil lamps in the Sun , polished the crystal orbs of the stars, and steered the motions of the Moon and the constellations . Since these governed the Kara-Turan calendar , Moon Women were the patron saints of festivals, portents, auspicious moments, and other matters of time.</p>
<p>Moon Women appeared as young women of slender build and wearing gauzy blue robes. They were often almost transparent.</p>
<p>It was believed they prized Mokan River pearls .</p>
