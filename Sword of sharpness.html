<p>A sword of sharpness was a powerful magical sword that dealt devastating damage to its targets.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Only certain types of swords could be enchanted to become swords of sharpness ; namely, those that slashed their targets rather than pierce them. Such swords included longswords , greatswords , and scimitars , among others.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Whenever a blow from a sword of sharpness connected with an object, it always dealt the maximum possible damage. Particularly precise hits not only dealt even more damage but also incurred a chance of severing a limb or part of the target's body.</p>
<p>In addition, the sword accepted a command word to start shining, illuminating a radius of 20 feet (6.1 meters). This property was deactivated once the command word was spoken again or if the sword was sheathed.</p>
