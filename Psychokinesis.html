<p>The psychokinesis discipline of psionics revolved around the manipulation or transformation of matter and energy, described by some as the movement and rearrangement of objects, down to very tiny motes of reality or molecules. Telekinesis was the purest expression of this telekinetic force, with for a time almost all psychokinetic powers requiring it as a prerequisite, but other representative powers included concussion blast , energy current , energy wave , matter agitation , and matter manipulation . Its equivalent among the schools of magic was evocation .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The displays or "visual effects" given off by many psychokinetic powers were spectacular, going above and beyond the standard displays manifested by powers of other disciplines. This discipline's powers were also noted for being able to inflict devastating harm to opponents.</p>
<p>Creatures that were immune to the effects of evocation magic were likewise immune to psychokinetic powers.</p>
