<p>Belarbrith was a more exotic species of tough and hardy root vegetable that survived cold winters and closely resembled a carrot .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Belarbrith's taste could be described as that of an apple pie (the variety that did not include cinnamon ). The edible root was chestnut -brown, blotched with gray. It was chewy and hard like an overgrown carrot. The vegetable's flesh was lighter brown and flecked with dark red knots or nodes.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>The wild vegetable could be foraged across the Eastern and Western Heartlands . However, by the late 15 th century, it was over-consumed and hard to find near settlements or busy roads. Belarbrith was very commonly cultivated in the Dalelands , Cormyr , northern Sembia , and was gaining popularity on the Sword Coast North . In the northern lands of the Savage Frontier , near Everlund and Silverymoon , Belarbrith's growth rate was greatly reduced because of the weather, producing a small, thin vegetable, while southern regions birthed fat and plump roots size of a human forearm.</p>
<h2>Usages</h2>
<p>Belarbrith roots were thoroughly cleaned of soil and fine hair-like roots, eaten raw, or peeled and sliced into disks. The vegetable was also often used as a culinary thickener or for flavor contrast in pork stews . When boiled and mashed, belarbrith was cooked into a type of dessert soup often consumed in the winter.</p>
