<p>Dimensional planes were pseudo-realities that permeated all the known planes of existence . Some considered them to be building blocks of reality that allowed for the coexistence of all the planes. The concept of these planes was typically beyond what the minds of most humanoids could fathom.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The known dimensional planes included the Temporal Prime and spatial dimensions , with potentially others existing.</p>
<h2>Types of Dimension Planes</h2>
<h3>Temporal Prime</h3>
<p>The Temporal Prime was a dimension in which the various timestreams of the multiverse could be observed and used to move through time, i.e. , time travel . Many sages on the Prime Material and even some chronomancers believed it to be a kind of demiplane within the Ethereal Plane , calling it the Demiplane of Time , trying to make fit it into their pre-existing notions and theories on the multiverse. However, many chronomancers swore that "dimensional plane" was the more technically correct term for the Temporal Prime.</p>
<h3>Spatial Dimensions</h3>
<p>The first three spatial dimensions were referred to as length , width , and depth or height . Some believed there were only up to five spatial dimensions, though far more existed.</p>
<p>The majority of lifeforms, such as humans and humanoids, existed in three-dimensional space and could only perceive the first three spatial dimensions. Some life forms could be found in higher dimensional spaces, such as the misi , which existed solely on the fourth through sixth spatial dimensions. Creatures of higher dimensional planes were often noted as not being able to see or interact with creatures of the lower dimensional planes.</p>
<p>With the right tools, powerful mages could open their perceptions to higher dimensional planes, such as Szass Tam , who created a nine-dimensional map of all then-surviving Dread Rings in Faer√ªn whilst wielding the crystal staff of the Zulkir Yaphyll in 1478 DR . However, this was an incredibly strenuous endeavor for even the most powerful of living or undead mages like Szass Tam, who collapsed from exhaustion shortly after dispelling his ninth-dimensional map. In addition, the rare potion of the fourth dimension allowed imbibers to temporarily enter and perceive the fourth dimension whilst retaining perception of three-dimensional space.</p>
