<p>Battle Garde was the divine realm of Garagos , originally known as Targus to the Netherese , a Faer√ªnian demigod of war.</p>
<h2>Cosmography</h2>
<p>To those who subscribed to the Great Wheel cosmology , Battle Garde was said to be originally located in the plane known as Limbo . But following defeat at the hands of Tempus , Garagos's disposition changed and he no longer felt comfortable in Limbo, so moved his realm to the second layer of Pandemonium .</p>
<p>According to the World Tree cosmology , Garagos nomadically roamed the celestial plane of Warrior's Rest and declared whatever region he happened to be in as Battle Garde.</p>
