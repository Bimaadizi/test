<p>Flamsterd Tower , also known as the Tower of Flamsterd and later as Flamsterd's Sunken Tower , was the home and laboratory of the eminent sage Flamsterd . It sat beneath the Trackless Sea just off the coast of the island of Flamsterd within the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The tower once sat atop a promontory on the seaward side of a large peninsula that comprised much of the southern half of Flamsterd. After it descended below the waves, this came to be known as the Underwater Realm of the Wizard .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The high tower and its surrounding gardens were covered by a massive bubble of air, which was permeable by living creatures but not by seawater. Inside this bubble was fresh air and temperatures that mimicked daily weather.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The tower hosted Flamsterd's laboratory, where he invented new spells and researched old magics .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Flamsterd erected his tower after moving to the island on which it sat, and he soon invited his apprentices from Waterdeep to join him as well as began recruiting students from among the local Ffolk . While welcomed at first (as the many wizards improved life on the island), the inhabitants of the Tower eventually drove away the locals as the apprentices began warring with each other.</p>
<p>Finally, in the Year of the Hooded Falcon, 1291 DR , Flamsterd sent his apprentices away (or transformed them into amphibians) and enacted a plan to move his tower to the bottom of the sea so that he could continue his research in peace and solitude. With the aid of powerful druids , he successfully shifted his tower and the surrounding peninsula safely beneath the waves, but this created a loud and massive explosion that left the rest of the island a wasteland. Flamsterd himself was thought to be dead for many decades following the incident.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The sage was once again inviting apprentices to join him in the mid–14 th century DR . Offering tutelage and safe haven for young mages , Flamsterd soon boasted one of the highest concentrations of arcane spellcasters in all of Faerûn . Food was plentiful within the bubble because fish were prone to accidentally pass through and fall into the tower.</p>
