<p>Nyrulna was a powerful, enchanted trident that was forged using wind as one of the components.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nyrulna was an ornate trident with three sharp crystalline prongs with a turquoise-blue color. Nyrulna shined with a glowing light in a small radius.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>In addition to serving as a formidable piercing weapon , Nyrulna possessed a +3 enchantment that made the magical fishing tool deadlier and guided the wielder's hand toward the target. Wielding the weapon made the user faster, jump higher and farther, and immune to injury from fallinge.</p>
<p>Upon being thrown, Nyrulna would return to its throwers hand. The user could not be forced to drop the trident. When thrown, the weapon created a thunderous explosion that dealt damage in a blast centered on the target.</p>
<p>Using the trident's magical properties, the wielder could rush forward and create an air vortex that blasted foes and possibly inflicted bleeding upon their enemies. They could also use Nyrulna to imitate the effects of the spell gust of wind , with the addition of dealing thunderous damage to those caught in it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nyrulna was crafted by the Forgemaster Lirrico for a champion of Akadi , Lady of the Winds. The main ingredient was the very wind of his home city, and no winds blew there for a full year after it was complete.</p>
<p>At some point prior to 1492 DR , the weapon found its way to a part of a jungle in Chult , where the djinni Akabi would send individuals that wronged him while visiting the Circus of the Last Days . There it lay in a locked chest next to the portal exiting the jungle.</p>
