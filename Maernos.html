<p>The Maernos ( pronounced : /ˈ m eɪ ɛ r n oʊ z / MAY-er-noz ) family was a human noble family in Waterdeep . The family line died out when Ultas Maernos passed away without a living spouse or heirs sometime around 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The family patriarch was Ultas Maernos in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR . He was a widower, having lost his wife and children to the plague in Amn in the Year of the Saddle, 1345 DR . He refused to remarry and the noble house went defunct after his death.</p>
<p>The Maernos family retained a trio of halfling adventurers that became known as the Defenders Three .</p>
<p>The family coat-of-arms consisted of a pair of praying hands with green sleeves and three silver spear heads on a royal blue field.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>House Maernos was primarily in the moneylending and financial services business, and specialized in assisting the various temples in Waterdeep with money matters.</p>
<p>In 1368 DR, Lord Maernos gave significant financial help to the newly recognized prince Haedrak Rhindaun III in his bid to rescue Zaranda Star and take over the throne of Tethyr .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The family villa and compound were located in the North Ward between Copper Street and the High Road about five blocks south of the Upper Towers . The north side of the compound faced Delzorin Street and the south side faced Sidle Street . The south wall was adorned with roaring lions' head sculptures.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>With no heirs, Ultas petitioned the Lord's Court in 1368 DR to be allowed to bequeath his holdings and wealth to the ten major temples and the Plinth , to be equally distributed by the Lord's Court. The family compound was to be converted into a temple specifically for use by the non-human residents of Waterdeep. After a closed-door session, the Magisters and the Lord's Court agreed to allow his request. By this time, Ultas had already started renovating his villa, buying paintings, carvings, and sculptures by elven , dwarven , and halfling artists appropriate for a place of worship.</p>
<p>After Ultas' passing, the Maernos compound became known as Holyhands House and was run by the Defenders Three. As of the 1490s DR, it was still in operation.</p>
