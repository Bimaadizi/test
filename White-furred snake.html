<p>White-furred snakes , also known as snow serpents , were a species of constrictor snake native to cold regions.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As their name suggested, these snakes were covered in white fur, highly adapted to the sub-arctic climate. Their hairs were barbed so as to gain better traction on snow and ice. They grew to be up to 100 feet (30 meters) long, and were warm-blooded.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>White-furred snakes would lie in wait for prey along snowy mountain paths. They attacked with a powerful bite, but the danger lay in their ability to constrict and crush their prey.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>White-furred snakes hunted in arctic hills, mountains, and plains, and could also be found in rough terrain and ruins.</p>
<h3>Homelands</h3>
<p>They were endemic to the Bloodstone Lands of Damara and Vaasa .</p>
<p>White-furred snakes could also be found on the world of Nehwon , and huge versions were rumored to have been seen in Pandemonium .</p>
<h3>Uses</h3>
<p>Their fur could be used for a wide range of unusual functions, and fetched a hefty price quite unlike the skins of the ordinary giant constrictor snakes.</p>
