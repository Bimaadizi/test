<p>A manual of golems was a book that contained instructions on how to construct a specific type of golem .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In order to read a manual of golems , the reader needed to be a reasonably accomplished spellcaster. Individuals unable to read the manual who attempted to do so risked damaging their own psyche.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Constructing the golem was an arduous job that required several days to complete and only allowed for small resting periods. Once all the instructions were followed, the manual burst into flames and burned to ashes. Sprinkling those ashes on the newly constructed golem brought it to life, under the control of its builder.</p>
<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
<p>Withers , an undead servant of Acererak charged with maintaining the Tomb of the Nine Gods in good repair, owned a manual of clay golems .</p>
