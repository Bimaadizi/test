<p>The Church of Milil was the primary religious organization of the followers of the deity Milil , the Lord of All Songs. The clergy of Milil were known as Sorlyn , although the reason was long forgotten.</p>
<h2>Dogma</h2>
<h3>Beliefs</h3>
<p>Practitioners of the Mililan faith viewed their life as a song, which started with their birth and would end at their final moment. They strove to find new songs and tunes or to create original ones, to master new instruments, and to share their knowledge with others. They considered songs as more than just lyrics and music, but as a complete whole, a process that included the initial idea until its completion.</p>
<h3>Attitudes</h3>
<p>Worshipers of Milil shared a love for music, and a need to take an active part in it. They were musicians, singers, composers, and dancers, but never simple listeners. They tended to favor a hedonistic lifestyle, enjoying fine foods and drinks and the company of others. They loved beautiful things such as well-built edifices, works of art, and natural wonders such as the invigorating radiance of the sun rising over a magnificent natural landscape. The church welcomed all genders equally, but was mostly composed of physically attractive members.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<h3>Creation and retrieval of knowledge</h3>
<p>The majority of the clergy spent their life away from adventuring, preferring to create new songs and to hone their musical skills. They however didn't stay cloistered in their temples, traveling to perform their art in front of others. Sorlyn both has a role as artists, creating new pieces; and as keepers of knowledge. They used the singing stone spell in order to create repositories of tunes, making some available in their temples and hiding other in caches to ensue the survival of music against all odds.</p>
<h3>Teaching</h3>
<p>It was customary for Mililan priests to offer singing courses and training with instruments to their flock in exchange for donations to the church. The price of such a service would vary, from a simple meal or drink for commoners to a hefty price for the very wealthy. They also made a good living in crafting and repairing instruments, again charging more to richer clients.</p>
<h3>Jurying</h3>
<p>It was traditional for clerics to act as jurors for musical contests. They were also asked to arbitrate in bardic disputes between individuals, companies, or colleges.</p>
<h3>Adventuring</h3>
<p>Part of the clergy, especially tuneservants , were more adventurous and would join adventurers on their quests in order to compose ballads narrating their exploits. Others embarked on solitary expeditions, trying to find rare instruments or recover forgotten songs from ages past. They would also protect or rescue musicians who were facing dangers, from the common minstrels to the greatest bards.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<h3>Society</h3>
<p>While relations between clergy members were generally good, friction sometimes occurred between tuneservants and more traditional members of the church. The main points of discontentment were the usage of holy spells for selfish reasons by tuneservants, and their support of irresponsible adventurers. In addition, temples run by tuneservants tend to forego traditional songs and hymns in favor of more recent works.</p>
<p>While all churches paid heed to the patriarch of the faith, his influence was stronger in northwest Faerûn and dwindled the further away one moved from Waterdeep. Distant congregations such as the ones in Sembia paid the Patriarch no more than lip service, and only paid attention to his most urgent communications.</p>
<h3>Clergy</h3>
<p>About half the clergy was made up of clerics . The remainder were tuneservants , a few bards and mystics , some spellsingers , spelldancers , loresingers , and an order of paladins .</p>
<p>In Serôs , some dolphins were priests of Milil, and they were known to employ whales to sing whalesongs for them.</p>
<h3>Titles</h3>
<p>Sorlyn considered titles to be important, and used them carefully. Tuneservants were an exception to the rule—they were pretty lax about the formal titles of other clergy members, except that of the Patriarch of Song.</p>
<p>The church used both titles and temple ranks, in addition to a few more specific denominations.</p>

<h3>Known Shrines & Other Places of Worship</h3>
<h2>Equipment, Spells, & Relics</h2>
<h3>Ceremonial Garb</h3>
<p>Robes of the Sorlyn were made of rich crimson fabric, garnished with golden decorations depicting subjects such as dragons , bards and warriors. They often wore metal chimes as jewelry, but removed them if they would impede music-making. Sorlyn usually kept their hair cut short in order to better listen to tunes, and to avoid issues when playing instruments. Tuneservants that choose to keep their hair long would keep them bound in golden hair-nets instead.</p>
<h3>Dress and Armor</h3>
<p>It was common for adventuring Sorlyn to wear heavy armors. Those armors were ornamented, in a similar way as their ceremonial dresses.</p>
<h3>Holy Symbols</h3>
<p>Some Sorlyn would use a real harp as their holy symbol , whereas others would wear it as a piece of jewelry.</p>
<h3>Weapons</h3>
<p>When threatened, members of the clergy relied on maces and enchanted musical instruments in addition to their spells.</p>
<h3>Relics</h3>
<h3>Others</h3>
<h3>Sorlyn Magic</h3>
<p>Some of the spells bestowed by Milil to his clergy could be cast by followers of other faiths as well. Doing so imposed powerful constraints on the caster though, and could anger their own deities.</p>
