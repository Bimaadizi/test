<p>Nathlekh , called the City of Cats , was a city on the Dragon Coast and the capital of the Shou nation of Nathlan in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Located at the western edge of the Gulthmere Forest on the shores of the Lake of the Long Arm , Nathlekh was built around a granite plug, atop which the Pride of Nobanion stood, seemingly as an extension of the rock.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was originally populated by feline lycanthropes worshiping Nobanion and Sharess . It had a significant population of mundane cats (including lions ) and its mysterious rulers were known as the Cat Lords. All of these factors certainly earned it its moniker.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Halflings' Lament, 1386 DR , the Spellplague caused the ground underneath the Shou ward of the city to rise several hundred feet higher then the rest of the city. This destroyed much of the non-Shou parts of the city.</p>
<p>In the Year of Deaths Unmourned, 1394 DR , the city outlawed refugees and fey from entering the city.</p>
<p>Settled by more and more immigrants from Kara-Tur over the centuries, by 1479 DR , the city had become populated almost entirely by Shou and the small nation of Nathlan had grown up around it. The citizens of Nathlekh were suspicious of outsiders. They forbade anyone not of Shou descent (especially non- humans ) from taking up residence in the city and restricted visitors to a single, special section of the city. By this time, the city had largely ceased to be called the "City of Cats".</p>
<h2>Law & Order</h2>
<p>Under the Cat Lords in the 1300s DR, a trio of lammasu judges passed judgement once a week on lawbreakers.</p>
