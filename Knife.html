<p>Knives were a common sort of cutting tool used in everyday life, with a multitude of potential functions. Knives resembled daggers , but tended to be smaller and used for non-combat purposes.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The average knife was a small single-edged, pointed blade, but they could also be serrated or hooked for specialized purposes. Typical heavy-duty blades were usually made from iron or steel , but dining cutlery could make use of brass and silver designs, and knapped flint or sharpened bone could also serve as cutting tools.</p>
<p>Knives and other small blades were often kept sharp through the regular use of a leather strop , a stiff piece of treated leather.</p>
