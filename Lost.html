<p>The Lost were a group of wood elves that lived in the Border Forest during the Age of Humanity and the Era of Upheaval . They were isolationist in nature, foregoing the wondrous isle of Evermeet for their ancestral home in the Dalelands .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When human forces expanded logging operations in the Tesh Valley , the woodlands that came to be known as the Border Forest were separated from the larger forest of Cormanthor . The isolated elves retreated deeper into the forest, separated from their kin.</p>
<p>One of the wood elves, Raunaeril the Rose , continued to maintain a relationship with the Dalesfolk. He met a woman in the village of Snowmantle , and in the year 1311 DR had a son, Lanseril Snowmantle , the only half-elf who had shared bloodlines with members of the Lost.</p>
<p>When Zhent forces took hold in the area around the Border Forest in 1330 DR , the elves cut off all contact with the outside world and came to be known as "the Lost".</p>
<p>In 1369 DR a group of adventurers came to the Border Forest, in an effort to free Snowmantle from the grip of the combined forces of the Zhentilar army and the more-nefarious Zhentarim agents. Upon their arrival they met the keeper of knowledge for the Lost. This wise old wood elf Tanseril , happened to also be the father of Raunaeril and grandfather of the recently imprisoned Lanseril (whom he regarded as "the half-breed"). While he couldn't allow any of his kin to leave their home, the ancient lorekeeper aided the adventurers in their efforts to save his grandchild by giving them a scroll of conjure nature elemental .</p>
