<p>Eiresse was a tiny pirate cove on the island of Gwynneth in the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It lay near the southwestern tip of the island, nominally a part of the kingdom of Corwell . It faced the eastern capes of the island of Flamsterd .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>By the cozy harbor stood a small tower, where lived the pirate Cairak Redbeard and Alabhansree Alanasker , known locally as as "Cymra Shanbadhe", The Lady in Silver, but really a princess of Ormpur who'd gone missing in 1357 DR . They still lived there by 1372 DR . Beneath the cove were winding natural sinkholes that led to the sea, where cold-water giant octopuses laired.</p>
