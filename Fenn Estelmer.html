<p>During the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR, Kyriani used Fenn to attend a party at Castle Waterdeep in order to investigate the purported avatar of the goddess Selûne , who was guest of honor. He introduced Kyriani to Open Lord Piergeiron , who spoke of her heroism in stopping the skeletal colossus , but Fenn didn't seem to be believe it, nor that she was a mage. He grew bored when she spoke of divine matters with Piergeiron and Khelben Arunsun , and she disposed of him with a kiss and a sleep spell. When he awoke looking for, she strode right past him to confront the false avatar . Later, he sighted her riding through the sky with Rellamyn on the back of an asperii , and was a bit heartbroken.</p>
<p>Fenn was with Kyriani on the hottest day of summer, in the Selûne's Smile tavern as Vajra Valmeyjar arm-wrestled Timoth Eyesbright while Onyx the Invincible collected bets. Fenn asked Kyriani which one to bet on, but she teased that he try his arm on the winner. At that point, Aviss and Fellandar escaped from their extra-dimensional prison to wreak a path of destruction in the city, and Kyriani and Onyx pursued and fought them. When all was done, Fenn was impressed with Kyriani's prowess.</p>
