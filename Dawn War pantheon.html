<p>The Dawn War pantheon was a pantheon of gods worshiped on the worlds of Nerath , Exandria , and other worlds of the multiverse .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<h3>Membership</h3>
<p>The gods of the Dawn War pantheon were a small group of deities that banded together during the Dawn War . They kept a loose alliance of coexistence (even between gods of Good and Evil ) and mutual help against common enemies. The alliance was maintained by the "compact of heaven," in which the gods agreed to share power in the natural world and shared control over angels . The compact included Evil in its terms but not Chaos , making it troublesome for chaotic deities to enforce the power of the compact at times.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The gods of the Dawn War pantheon were "universal" gods, meaning that even if they were "racial" gods they were worshiped by members of all races instead of just the races they created.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, the Dawn War pantheon was an alliance of gods under the terms of the "compact of heaven". Despite rivalries and hatreds between its members, the gods of the Dawn War pantheon were aware that the existence of their alliance (and by extension the survival of their rival deities) was necessary to survive against threats such as the primordials or the Far Realm .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Dawn War pantheon was created out of necessity, as a small group of gods from different worlds allied together to survive during the Dawn War. When the primordials attacked the worlds of Realmspace , the gods of the Dawn War pantheon were summoned to Abeir-Toril by Sel√ªne and Shar to help the twin goddesses to defend Realmspace.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR , some of the Dawn War gods still had some degree of influence on Toril .</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The following were the members of the Dawn War pantheon known on the world of Nerath:</p>
<p>In the world of Exandria, a minor goddess named Raei was also considered part of this pantheon.</p>
