<p>Fang Island was a small island that sat in the mouth of the River Mirar in the city of Luskan .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The island was uninhabited and craggy, and earned its name because its sharp rocks were known to tear apart any boat or barge that was swept downriver. It hosted a self-sustaining area of wild magic that would randomly discharge dangerous spells . Although rare, these magical bursts could illuminate a dark night in the city.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The island lay between Harbor Arm Island and the inhabited islands in the River Mirar's mouth ( Blood Island , Closeguard Island , and Cutlass Island ).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Arcane Brotherhood had plans to build on the barren Fang Island as of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , and its wild magic zone was the result of a failed effort by them to create an extremely powerful ward there. They subsequently were unable to remove this phenomenon.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Bent Blade, 1376 DR , the island was seized by Deudermont and Ship Kurth , and was used as part of a blockade of the river in their battle to drive Arklem Greeth and the Arcane Brotherhood out of the city.</p>
<p>During the traumatic events of the Spellplague in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , the island was suffused with fire and light as it lifted into the air as an earthmote . It remained above the city for a century, occasionally spawning terrifying monsters or spilling acid rain.</p>
<p>Following the Second Sundering , it had returned to the river and was once again noted for its tendency to tear ships apart. It remained uninhabited.</p>
