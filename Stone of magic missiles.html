<p>A stone of magic missiles was a rare magical weapon.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was a featureless, white oval stone akin to a hen's egg, able to fill an entire human palm. Faint sparkles coalesced around it from time to time, soon fading.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Upon grasping the stone, any sapient creature was instantly aware its purpose was to emit harmful bolts of magic, up to four a minute, in the manner of the magic missile spell. However, those who didn't cast spells could only fire off one at a time, instead of four. It could operate up to four minutes at a time, thrice a day; if operated a fourth time, it would stop working for about two weeks, or maybe just under two and a half tendays.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Talatha Vaerovree kept such a stone hidden in Castle Endreth , where another Magister had hidden it.</p>
