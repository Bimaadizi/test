<p>The A-Ling Shan was a mountain range located in the Hordelands .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>An extension of the great Yehimal , this mountain range divided the southern portion of Raurin from the Katakoro Plateau . It also marked the northeastern and eastern borders of the kingdom of Ulgarth in the south. The Jumpa River flowed past the A-Ling Shan in the north-west.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like its parent the Yehimal, the A-Ling Shan was a tangled labyrinth of high, ice-capped peaks. The frozen peaks of this range, most notably the Mahamsaratsu Shan in the east, reached high into the sky. Most reached elevations of between 17,000 ft (5,200 m) and 24,000 ft (7,300 m). The A-Ling Shan was among the "high peaks" category of the ranges of the Hordelands, which were typically formed from folded and upthrust granite , with jagged profiles.</p>
<p>Several notable glaciers, including the Shigatse Glacier and the Glacier of the Dragon , were found within the A-Ling Shan range. The glaciers crept at almost the very sides of range. Lakes from glacial run-off formed at the base of the mountains as melting snow and ice were trapped by rocky depressions. Flash flooding was a known danger in the region.</p>
<p>The mountain range was mostly unexplored and unsettled, and only a single pass, Yarlhang La , opened through it in the north, joining the Old Caravan Road . In the west, there were no known points that afforded a crossing of the Jumpa River Gorge below Yarlhang La, so the only passage into the A-Ling Shan was via the eastern valleys.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Among other terrifying monsters, yetis and dragons were known to make their homes on the cold slopes of the A-Ling Shan, and raided the nearby lands for food. In particular, the Glacier of the Dragon was a major nesting ground for white dragons . Greater oni could also be found in the mountains.</p>
<p>Local fauna included cave bears and snow leopards .</p>
<p>Mahamsaratsu Shan was said to be home to a powerful but evil spirit that lured people to their deaths.</p>
<p>The fortress monastery of the Tiger's Nest stood concealed and inaccessible on the northwestern face of the A-Ling Shan. It was home to the mystical Invisible Tigers monastic order.</p>
