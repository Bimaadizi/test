<p>House Basadoni , also known as the Basadoni Cabal and the Basadoni Guild , was one of the more powerful thieves' guilds of Calimport in Calimshan in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was led for many years by its namesake, Pasha Basadoni .</p>
<p>The Basadoni Cabal took in a young Artemis Entreri as a member. He rose to the rank of lieutenant in the guild before leaving to work for Pasha Pook .</p>
<p>When Enteri returned to Calimport in the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR , Pasha Basadoni invited him to join again, but Entreri refused. Soon after, some high-ranking members of House Basadoni tried to kill Entreri to maintain the guild's prestige, but Entreri killed them allâ€”at the price of involving Jarlaxle and Bregan D'aerthe . At last Entreri and the drow assaulted Basadoni's palace and confronted the pasha. Basadoni acknowledged the power of the drow and offered instead an alliance with them with himself as figurehead leader and Jarlaxle commanding from shadows. Entreri seemingly accepted the pact but then killed Basadoni in cold blood, claiming the leadership of House Basadoni for himself.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR , House Basadoni became the front for Jarlaxle's attempts to widen his band of rogue drow's influence to the surface world. Artemis served as the figurehead of the house during the ruse. However, Jarlaxle increasingly fell under the influence of Crenshinibon until his two lieutenants, Kimmuriel Oblodra and Rai-guy , enacted a plot to overthrow him. He was only rescued from his own follies by Entreri, who claimed to need Jarlaxle alive to protect him from the two drow lieutenants. Jarlaxle made an agreement with Kimmuriel for co-leadership of Bregan D'aerthe while he and Artemis went traveling around the surface. This coup within Bregan Daerthe left House Basadoni in turmoil.</p>
