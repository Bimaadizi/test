<p>Ojy was the spiritual guide of the village of Golden in the land of Koryo in Kara-Tur long before the 14th century DR . [ speculation ] He was known for forging the magical shuriken called the stars of Ojy-do .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When bandits besieged the village of Golden, the villagers were forced to defend themselves and Ojy was pressed into work as a weaponsmith, though he knew little of metalworking. With every accurate strike of his hammer, he thanked his guiding spirits, and so the stars of Ojy-do were forged from the strength of his faith. They proved just as resilient. . He also crafted other weapons, and with his creations, the villagers fought back.</p>
<p>By 1372 DR , stars of Ojy-do circulated around the northwest Faer√ªn and the Sword Coast North .</p>
