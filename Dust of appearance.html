<p>Dust of appearance was an enchanted powder capable of revealing invisible objects.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When thrown into the air, this fine metallic powder would coat everything, revealing all hidden objects, including those that were invisible, out of phase, ethereal, etc. The dust also revealed mirror images and projected images for their true nature. The effects of items such as a cloak of displacement or robe of blending were negated as well. The dust worked to reveal both living and nonliving things, lasting for 2–20 minutes.</p>
<p>Dust of appearance was stored in hollow bone blow tubes within a pouch or in small packets made of silk . Each tube represented a single use, covering a 10 ft (3 m) radius when thrown. The dust would cover a cone area measuring 1 ft (0.3 m) at the base by 20 ft (6.1 m) long and 15 ft (4.6 m) wide at the end if blown from the tube.</p>
