<p>Bakkal's Creek was a tributary of the River of Ice in Calimshan .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This icy-cold stream flowed calmly from the foothills of the Marching Mountains until it joined with Two Falls River from the west at the Cold Eyes to form the River of Ice. As the creek traveled south, it carved a deep canyon along its banks.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Until the Third Age of Calimshan , a temple once stood on the banks of this creek, dedicated to a dark god whose name is now lost to history. The bakkals , the ancient theocratic rulers of the nation of Coramshan and of Calimshan's First and Second Ages , used to ceremonially bathe in the stream after performing symbolic rituals at the temple as part of their coronations. The temple was destroyed by beholders during the Orb Marches .</p>
