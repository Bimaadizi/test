<p>Quess'Ar'Teranthvar , also known as the Golden Grove of Hidden Knowledge was a collection of five sets of ten Nether Scrolls each, changed into the form of a tree.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A High Mage named Tyvollus Aluviirsan transformed one set of the original metal scrolls into a thin golden beech tree, with golden metal leaves and a trunk that held the face of a treant . In the tree's foliage were a small silver bird and a snake with golden, silver, and electrum scales. The bird and snake were said to represent Corellon and Mystra , both deities of magic.</p>
<p>Just like the original scrolls, the Quess'Ar'Teranthvar was highly resilient to alteration or destruction. Its form had to continually be magically maintained by Tyvollus Aluviirsan; if he were separated from it the tree would have collapsed into molten metal. After twenty years or less, the metal would have once again reformed itself into the original metal scrolls.</p>
<p>Purposefully changing the tree back into its original scroll form involved the use of prolonged rituals , or powerful Netherese relics , such as the Chalice of Amaunator .</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The elves learned that the scrolls had to be read in order, and also that every race that read them learned different information. For example, one of the main thieves of the scrolls was Rilmohx Sha'Quessir , a gnome elf-friend who learned a vast knowledge of illusion magic by glancing only briefly through the scrolls. The elves also learned that altering the scroll's form into something different allowed for hidden meanings to be revealed.</p>
<p>The Nether Scrolls , in this form, allowed for six different ways of learning its secrets:</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The empire of Netheril had acquired a set of the Nether Scrolls , a fact that explained their rapid rise and their mastery of magic. The elves arranged for the theft of the scrolls from the Netherese in −3095 DR , and secreted them away in Windsong Tower , in the city of Cormanthor . High mage Tyvollus Aluviirsan transformed the stolen set into the Quess'Ar'Teranthvar for use by the People. After its creation, The high mage remained with the tree, needing to use all of his concentration to force the tree to retain its shape.</p>
<p>The first human to learn magic from the tree was Ecamane Truesilver . He spent ten months in meditation with the Quess'Ar'Teranthvar in the Year of Loose Coins, 580 DR , earning great wisdom and prematurely whitened hair in the process.</p>
<p>In the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR , agents of Hadrhune ripped the Quess'Ar'Teranthvar out of Windsong Tower, unbeknownst to the warriors of the Cormanthor War , and spirited it away to the Anauroch desert. Darcassan the Farseer managed to get word of the theft to the Liberators of Shadowdale but couldn't help them find its location other than to suggest that they search for the Crypt of Augathra the Mad .</p>
<p>The adventurers found the crypt along with the Lost Sage , who granted them a vision of a way to destroy the tree before the Shadovar could use it for their own ends. The adventurers managed to succeed in their task, dissolving the Quess'Ar'Teranthvar and scattering the component Nether Scrolls to the winds.</p>
