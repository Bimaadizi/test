<p>The Legacy of Deep Death was a temple dedicated to Myrkul , located on the sea bed of the Sea of Swords during the 14 th century DR . It was unique in that it was the only Myrkulyte temple created after the deity's destruction during the Time of Troubles . The temple was magically constructed by three cleric - liches who continued to venerate the Lord of Bones beyond his destruction on Toril .</p>
<p>The temple was protected by number of monstrous sea creatures including an undead kraken and horribly mutated sahuagin .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Myrkul was destroyed by Midnight atop the Blackstaff Tower in Waterdeep in 1358 DR , his body swelled with grim energy that was on the verge of exploding. Just prior to this, the young mage cast a dimension door , in an effort to transport the Dark God's body away from the city, over the Sea of Swords. Myrkul's body detonated in the sky, spewing forth a mephitic cloud of death that rained down in a 5 miles (8,000 meters) radius. The sea floor was was permanently tainted and continuously produced throngs of aquatic undead, including lacedons and sea zombies . The temple was erected in the center of this tainted area.</p>
