<p>The Fang of Skulls was a giant spike of stone that jutted out from the center of the Dead Orc Pass . It was named for the hundreds of skulls, tusks, and other bones that decorated its length, all of which were gathered from foes and prey slain by the Tornskulls orc tribe.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The menhir stood 40 feet (12 meters) tall. The skulls and bones attached were lashed to the peak's side by means of leather thongs. Intertwined with this mass of bone material was a crude ladder that allowed the orcs to ascend its height.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>It was rumored that a portal existed at the Fang's peak, though its destination was entirely unknown.</p>
