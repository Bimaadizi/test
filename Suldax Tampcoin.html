<h2>History</h2>
<p>Suldax started his career in the Shadow Thieves as a thief and moneylender. Soon, he proved so talented that he was promoted to guildmaster of racketeers and then even guildmaster of con artists and tricksters (nobody had ever before held two different guildmaster positions). At last, Suldax ascended to the Shadow Council.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Suldax had an uncanny knack for estimating weight and balance. He could estimate the weight of precious metals to within five percent of its actual value without any particular efforts. If the metal was pure, he could even determine how much it was worth.</p>
