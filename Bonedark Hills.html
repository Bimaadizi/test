<p>The Bonedark Hills was the name given by the people of Thesk to a bleak and gray region of badlands in eastern Thesk and western Thay created by the upheavals of the Spellplague . The area was known to the Thayans as the Contested Lands .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The land was broken by the rising and eruption of the Thaymount , resulting in scree fields and steep terrain riddled with twisting passes and tunnels. The region was covered by clouds of volcanic smoke and blanketed in ash. The sun was often not visible through the haze, and even when it was, the sheer cliffs of the looming Thayan Plateau to the east blocked the sunrise for several hours, casting the land in shadow. Travel through the area could be difficult and exhausting.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Bonedark Hills were a broad area across eastern Thesk extending into Thay's political boundaries down the western base of the Thayan Plateau. Precarious switchback trails led up the jagged, nearly vertical cliffs of the Plateau to Thay proper, with tax stations , guard posts, and arcane siege engines protecting the routes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The region was formed during the apocalyptic events of the Spellplague in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , and left the towns of Nethentir , Nethjet , and Surcross broken. In the century that followed, Thayan forces would begin to fortify these towns, much to the concern of Thesk. By the late 15 th century DR , the Thayans—at the behest of Szass Tam —had begun transforming these forts into Dread Rings and his agents continually tested Thay's neighbors' borders by raiding villages to capture slaves to work in Thayan mines. Seeking some advantage in this relationship, Thesk founded Echo Village as a trade outpost in hopes that establishing commerce with Thay.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the tensions between Thay and Netheril flared and the Netherese enclave of Kolthunral arrived in the area in a surprise attack to deny the Thayans access to the Shadowfell Road , which they were using to further their ambitions at a Dread Ring across Faerûn near Neverwinter . Over the following months, the flying city unleashed a bombardment that decimated a large swath of the land, forcing Thay onto the defensive at both Surcross and Veil .</p>

<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The residents of the area lived mostly in very small and scattered communities.</p>
<p>As a border region between Thesk and imperialistic Thay, the Bonedark Hills were patrolled by murderous Thayan soldiers (both living and all manner of undead ), including gnolls and orcs . These patrols sometimes rode skeletal steeds or made use of chariots —both heavy vehicles pulled by undead beasts as well as lighter ones that propelled themselves by magic .</p>
