<p>Recorder stones , also known as sensory stones , were a variety of enchanted gems unique to the Society of Sensation planar faction of Sigil .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These stones were small, round in shape, and made of many semiprecious minerals.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Recorder stones allowed people to encode or "record" upon them their experiences, in the form of single or set of sensations. It usually took about an hour to record an experience, though long or complex ones could take an entire day to encode.</p>
<p>Once an experience was encoded upon a recorder stone , it could be accessed and experienced by anyone just by activating the stone, which required physically touching the stone and focus one's thoughts, though it was possible to enchant a recorder stone to only provide access to a specific user. Once a stone was activated, its user would lose all sense of reality and become engulfed in the sensation(s) of the stone.</p>
<p>Generally, whenever a recorder stone was removed from the sensoriums of the Civic Festhall, they would revert to unenchanted rock. Though there were some exceptions to this. In addition, it was possible to become addicted to the experiences provided by recorder stones .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Ayryn Farlight held a scrying session for select members of the Society of Sensation, using her sorcerous gift to observe and record activities of various deities of Toril on to recorder stones . When she attempted to scry the goddess of luck Tymora . Her magic sight was redirected by the goddess to observing Jasmine and Joel of Finder Wyvernspur 's Band. Eventually, her sight was focused on Milil who was delighted to have an audience. The deity used magic to affix the scrying and performed the following songs: the Baker's Daughter , a jaunty hin tune - Pipeweed Dreams , a lengthy ballad - the Seven Sisters , followed by Three Thayvian Roses , the Purple Dragons of Cormyr , and a number of Faerunian folk songs about such mundane things as milking cows , weather, and crops. Eventually, the Sensates started getting bored of the performance, to what Milil responded by starting to sing an opera - the Fall of Myth Drannor . The long and torturous performance was a punishment for trying to record activities of gods. The entirety of this event, like all scrying gatherings of the Sensates, was ultimately encoded upon recorder stones .</p>
