<p>Bottles of the healer were enchanted bottles that magically refilled themselves with special curative wine .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Wine created by such bottles was foul-tasting, dry, highly alcoholic, and thin.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>One bottle produced enough wine to emulate the effects of the cure light wounds spell . The enchantments eventually refilled the bottle once it was emptied. The same magic prohibited a person from carrying more than one bottle of the healer at the time. If a person carried more than one bottle, all the bottles immediately cracked, losing all magic and curative wine inside.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , a precious wine box of holding belonged to the maedar winemaker Vorlon who ran the Morden Winery , located in a valley outside the village of Dragon Falls in the Vast . His extradimensional box contained more treasures: an enchanted bottle of the healer and a rare crystal bottle of elverquisst bottled in ancient Myth Drannor . The maedar offered the box and its contents to the adventurers who helped him work out the deal between his winery and its rightful owner, Shauna Morden of Ravens Bluff .</p>
