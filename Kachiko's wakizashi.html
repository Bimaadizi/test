<p>Kachiko's wakizashi was a unique enchanted blade from somewhere in Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This wakizashi possessed a powerful +3 enchantment that improved the wielder's aim and dealt more powerful damage than an ordinary blade. Upon a successful slash, Kachiko's wakizashi had a chance of temporarily stupefying the opponent, effectively reducing their perceptiveness with each landed attack.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Little was recorded of the weapon's history. The only thing known for sure was its owner – a female warrior named Kachiko who wielded this wakizashi somewhere in Kara-Tur, sometime before the 14 th century DR .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Kachiko's wakizashi , along with several other magic items from Icewind Dale, ended up in the hands of the merchant named Joluv who traveled from Icewind Dale to the City of Coin, Athkatla , to sell the items to wealthy Amnian adventurers. Joluv peeled his wars from the Copper Coronet in Athkatla's River District .</p>
