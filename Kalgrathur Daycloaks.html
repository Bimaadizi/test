<p>Kalgrathur Daycloaks was the Magister from 887 DR to 889 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was vigorous, burly and handsome, with a craggy, broken nose. His hair was shaggy and gave him the appearance of a wolf.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He had a temper and roaring voice that were described as matching those of a wolf. His hobbies included card games, fowl hunting with throwing knives or javelins, and collecting lore about his family.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before being the Magister , Kalgrathur Maurmurra sought lore about his family, the Daycloaks of Halruaa , who had been exiled for a crime he could only guess at. He also cofounded the Nightfire Lances , a mercenary group, and took power in Maurmurra , where he used a spell to force the previous king, Uemer Vordryn , to slit his own throat, and the other courtiers to bow to him, becoming High Lord of Maurmurra in 882 DR . His reign was unpopular, and he kept using his mercenary group as protection against his own forces, which were reluctant to attack other baronies as he sought in his constant bids to enlarge his realm.</p>
<p>While enlarging his realm, he came across the Castle of Beasts , where he slew Sharglar Dulrathran , acquiring the mantle of the Magister , much to his surprise. He ignored Mystra 's mandates for the Magister, slaughtering anyone who showed so much as interest in magic within territories he conquered. She finally ran out of patience and forced him into hour-long states of feeblemind whenever he cast a spell. Though this did not affect his health in other ways, another mage, Jonsryn Daerathal , soon slew him in battle.</p>
