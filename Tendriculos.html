<p>The tendriculos was a type of monstrous plant creature whose origins in the Realms were uncertain.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The tendriculos was best known for possessing an extremely rapid regenerative ability, allowing it to quickly grow and regrow its body, with whole new leaves and vines appearing on it within just a few minutes.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>The tendriculos fought by grappling creatures with its large tendril vines and then attempting to swallow them whole.</p>
