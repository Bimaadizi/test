<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gunhild was the guard captain of Stoutheart's group, and worked to protect the dwarves from the myriad threats beneath the earth as they looked for the jewels of ardor . Unfortunately, a House Argith drow expedition from Sschindylryn arrived as well and began enslaving the dwarves to mine the jewels for them. Once the drow stronghold was located, Gunhild sent a team to destroy their forces and slay their leader, the High Priestess Talice Argith . She waved off any mention of focusing on recovering the jewels of ardor, and so her team fought their way into the drow outpost and slew the High Priestess, saving many slaves in the process. When they returned Gunhild's mood had changed precipitously, and she was greatly angered that they had not recovered any jewels of ardor while on their assault. Only the fact that they had destroyed the drow army stayed her wrath.</p>
