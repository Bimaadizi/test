<p>The Shard Shunners were a gang of halfling wererats operating in Waterdeep in the late 15 th century DR. Their name came from their refusal to deal in silver , called shards in Waterdeep, because of their wererat nature.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Shard Shunners committed petty crimes around the city. Around 1492 DR , they were pickpocketing patrons at the Endshift Tavern in the Field Ward as retribution for a disagreement between the tavern owner and one of their members.</p>
<p>They were hired by Emmek Frewn to harass a group of adventurers. The adventurers had reopened Trollskull Tavern , a bar that he had personally tried to buy but was outbid. He opened his own establishment nearby, Frewn's Brews , and felt that the Tavern was too near to his own business.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The gang operated from a halfling-owned hostel on Spices Street in the Dock Ward .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>There was a tenuous alliance between the Shard Shunners and the Xanathar's Thieves' Guild . The hostel that served as a base of operations for the Shard Shunners shared a cellar entrance to the sewers very near to one of the Xanathar's underground hideouts.</p>
