<p>Skull Island Prison was a prison on Skull Island in Skullport .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This isolated two-story castle stood at the southern tip of Skull Island. It served as a holding facility for slaves who have been sold and were awaiting transportation to distant lands. The castle was encircled by seven square towers, each strategically positioned to allow guards to unleash volleys of crossbow fire in the event of an attack. Typically, four guards were stationed in each tower, though this number was increased when the prison becomes overcrowded or the island fortress faced a threat.</p>
<p>The interior of the castle was composed of narrow corridors and small, confined cells where slaves were kept. A heavy portcullis stood ready to be dropped in the event of a siege or assault, though such incidents have been exceedingly rare, and the portcullis has not been deployed for over a century. The castleâ€™s defenses, while robust, were largely maintained as a precautionary measure, as Skull Island has not faced a significant external threat in recent memory.</p>
