<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Brida had dark hair and a terrible scar.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Brida was next to Dorlan Nyrotha as he attempted to pry open the chest where Anusha Marhana hid aboard the Green Siren as a stowaway in 1396Â DR . Anusha was using her dreamform to explore the ship unseen; when she brought her dreamform to try and stop him, Brida caught a glimpse of the ordinarily invisible form on a mirror. As Dorlan was rendered unconscious by the dreamform's power, she took the reflection for a ghost , and called for help.</p>
