<p>The Gulder's Good Grub Inn (previously Gulder's Good Grubb Inn ), was an inn in the city of Tantras in the Vast . It was located on the eastern edge of the city, just near the city wall.</p>
<p>Around 1358 DR , it was known as a cozy establishment, typically full of regular patrons year-round, except in the worst of winter. The conditions were good and the prices cheap. However, it was commandeered by the Guard of Tantras for use as an army barracks during the Time of Troubles of that year.</p>
