<p>Lif was a poltergeist that haunted Trollskull Manor in Waterdeep in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lif was a half-elf barkeeper who even after his death couldn't abandon his old tavern on Trollskull Alley and tried to scare away all new owners. In 1492Â DR , Volothamp Geddarm acquired the place at a low price and later formally gave it to some adventurers whom he had hired to save Floon Blagmaar .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Lif's life was his work. If a new owner opened another tavern inside Trollskull Manor , he could gradually become quite accommodating to them.</p>
