<h3>Species of Catastrophic Dragons</h3>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the legends surrounding the Dawn War , it was claimed that Io , creator and god of all dragons, was slain by a primordial. In the aftermath, most dragons chose to serve either Bahamut or Tiamat , but some lost faith in gods altogether and, believing that the primordials would win the war, turned to those powerful entities and offered them their service.</p>
<p>Seven of the primordials accepted the service of these dragons, and transformed- or perhaps corrupted- them into catastrophic dragons. They sowed great destruction during the war, and survived the primordials' downfall only to scatter across the planes.</p>
