<p>Daerdatha "Darkspells" was a drow sorceress involved in the infiltration of Scornubel during the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Daerdatha changed spell-spun disguises often. Even close associates were not sure what she actually looked like.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Daerdatha was forceful, decisive, practical, but above all ruthless, willing to eliminate her own associates without even a second thought over the most trivial signs of hesitation.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>She was a sorceress, with enough abilities to pass for a cleric . She knew at least one spell that transformed its targets permanently into different shapes, which she used to create disguises for her fellow drow. She could directly affect the minds of her fellows, in some cases, sending not just commands but memories, and even painful admonishments, apparently being able to even grant that power for other people to execute on her behalf. One of her spells allowed her to mind-touch people, even through underlings in her command, lessening risk to herself. Another spell allowed her to make heads explode.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>She carried a crown of sorts, which she used for some magic. It was highly likely the crown was enchanted .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Daerdatha was a central figure in the infiltration of Scornubel during the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . She likely trained some of them.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The sorceress had personally recruited Anlaervrith Mrantarr to the infiltration of Scornubel, and kept close tabs on her, using magic to force commands into her mind at times. She was also in contact with several other drow in the infiltration, including the one impersonating the husband of Anlaervrith's assumed identity, and the warrior Quztyr .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point prior to Dove Falconhand 's investigation of her drow infiltration of Scornubel, Daerdatha had recruited a number of drow, including Anlaervrith Mrantarr, to serve as spell-changed infiltrators in that city.</p>
<p>On the night they were to attempt the taking of Halonder Eldeglut and his wife Iyrevven Eldeglut , Daerdatha discovered Anlaervrith Mrantarr had been supplanted by a different drow; when she had Quztyr, one of her warriors, attempt to mind-ream her, he was struck senseless by blowback. She immediately had him slain by his fellow Nuelvar Faeroenel . Linking her mind with that of several of her fellows by means of her crown, she was able to glean that the drow was Qilu√© Veladorn , one of the Seven Sisters and a Chosen of Mystra . She determined then the best way to deal with her while preventing divine vengeance was to break her wrists, gag and blindfold her, and finally throw her into the river to drown and be eaten by fish.</p>
<p>After the Chosen was hurled into the River Chionthar , Nuelvar Faeronel sighed with obvious loss, leading to her snap decision to explode his head on the spot.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>When deciding on how to kill Lady Veladorn, Daerdatha made reference to a decree then, that "no more drow blood shall be spilled in this city", thus making it a requirement to kill her bloodlessly. This was likely a ruse, as she had moments before had one of her warriors slit another's throat, and killed that warrior immediately after her execution by making his head explode. Both deaths almost certainly spilled some amount of blood as a result.</p>
