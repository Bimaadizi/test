<p>Old Thindar was a portion of Thindar that had been swallowed by the sea.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Old Thindar composed the main portion of Thindar's port district. This section of this city would slowly erode with each storm that passed overhead, eventually leading to a complex of ruins that were completely submerged under the waters of the Thingulph . Daring adventurers often tried to search the sunken ruins for hidden treasure but few returned because of the presence of dangerous yuan-ti .</p>
