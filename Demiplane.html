<p>Demiplanes were ill-defined planes of unusually small size that lay either within other planes or outside the known planes depending on which cosmological model one used. Demiplanes were typically, if not always, of finite size.</p>
<h2>Characteristics</h2>
<p>According to earlier sources, demiplanes were planes still in the formation process, unfinished somehow More modern sources considered the demiplanes to be a catch-all classification for planes of generally measurable size and limited access, sometimes limited sufficiently that not even the ethereal plane or the astral plane were accessible, save from specific spots in other planes. They had great variety of possible conditions within. They were always extradimensional spaces.</p>
<p>Demiplanes could be naturally occurring, but most were created by deities or by wielders of magic, using a spell such as genesis , or by psion shapers with the power of the same name . Zagyg Yragerne of Oerth was notorious for creating demiplanes. Demiplanes that touched upon the Wall of Color in the Ethereal Plane had portals of unique and consistent colorations leading to them.</p>
