<p>The Cloister of St. Uzurr was a monastery of Ilmater that lay at the heart of city of Uzurr in Lapaliiya and was home to the Order of St. Uzurr .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was founded during the time of the Shoon Imperium ( 27 â€“ 450 DR ), when Ilmatari missionaries of the Order of St. Uzurr traveled from Calimshan to Lapaliiya. On a hilltop west of the Lapal Way, they constructed a walled monastery with a cloister, named the Cloister of St. Uzurr after their patron saint . In the following centuries, a city grew up around the monastery, which became known simply as "Uzurr".</p>
<p>A member of the Order was a spy working for the yuan-ti House Eselemas and reported on Kadar's research into curing tainted ones and broodguards . In response, yuan-ti purebloods began infiltrating Uzurr on Eleasias 1 , the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , with the aim of assassinating Kadar.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Both the monastery and the city were governed by the Abbot of St. Uzurr. Circa 1373 DR , this was Abbot Kadar al Ilmater .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Order, Cloister, and city cultivated, produced and exported olives, wines , and assorted spices to support themselves.</p>
