<p>Xargithorvar , better known by his nickname Foilsunder , was a green dragon of unknown age who laired in the Winterwood near the Wintercloak River of the Lake of Steam region in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Even though the exact location of Foilsunder's lair was unknown, it stood somewhere around 20 miles (32,000 meters) away from the Wintercloak River.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Rumors of Xargithorvar lairing in the Winterwood started appearing several years before the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR ; however, not many took them seriously. Despite that, the wyrm had been calling the forest his home for several decades by that point. At least three groups of adventurers ventured into Winterwood to find Foilsunder's lair, but none returned.</p>
<p>During the Dracorage of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Xargithorvar became affected by the event and went into a frenzy across Winterwood, destroying everything in his path. Local rangers counted around a hundred orcs to have been displaced by the rampage, sending the horde towards Ilmater 's Monastery of the White Willow .</p>
<p>As of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Xargithorvar came into conflict with the Winterwood cell of an elven extremist group—the Eldreth Veluuthra . The elves sought a way to drive the green dragon from the woods the cell considered their own.</p>
