<p>Furjur's Flying Carpet was a shop on Northwind street , in the city of Sundabar , that specialized in a variety of items from the Shining South . It was owned by the famous Waterdhavian merchant Furjur the Flippant though ran in his absence by six young shop-keeps.</p>
<p>Though it was more of a general or specialty goods store, the Flying Carpet was the only place locals of the vale could visit to find miscellaneous, replacement items they might need in a hurry, save for a visit to Silverymoon .</p>
<p>The Flying Carpet was full of items that were far out-of-place in the north such as brass lamps , revealing clothing woven from thin fabric, beaded curtains and even an actual old, dusty flying carpet , which was available for sale at the low cost of 45,000 gp .</p>
