<p>Ithmong , known as the Stormwracked City , was a city in Lapaliiya in southwest Faerûn in the mid–14th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It stood on the Lapal Way on top of a cliff that stood 50 feet (15 meters) high at the head of Ithmong Bay and beside Ithmong Peninsula. Owing to its position, Ithmong suffered the majority of storms that traversed the Shining Sea , hence its title.</p>
<h2>Government & Religion</h2>
<p>The ruler of Ithmong held the title "shoonsar", a hereditary position. Around 1373 DR , it was led by Shoonsar Darhost "the Mongrel" Tharsuir . It was the next most politically powerful city in Lapaliiya after the capital, Sheirtalar . In practice, the Overking of Lapaliiya needed to negotiate with the Shoonsar to have decrees passed by the Grand Council.</p>
<p>The civic deity of Ithmong was Bhaelros , also known as Talos , the Storm Lord.</p>
<h2>Population</h2>
<p>Despite the havoc wreaked by the storms, Ithmong was a metropolis of 46,729 people, the second largest in Lapaliiya after Sheirtalar.</p>
<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>Ithmong's docks were constructed inside a series of a dozen linked seacaves at the base of the cliffs. Together, they gave the city an underground port district. A high volume of goods from the Lapaliiyan hinterlands and Halruaa passed through these, making it the second richest city in the realm.</p>
