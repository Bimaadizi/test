<p>Yquog was a barghest whelp member of the Legion of the Chimera in the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , the town of Targos in Icewind Dale was besieged by the Legion of the Chimera. One of the Legion's surprise attacks involved teleporting goblins from underground tunnels into the Targos docks. The next attack came as a direct assault on the town's palisades. Lord Ulbrec Dinnesmore of Targos ordered a group of mercenaries from Luskan to follow two of his scouts, Ennelia and Braston , southeast to the goblin fortress.</p>
<p>The fortress and the caves underneath were not just occupied by goblins but also by other monstrous humanoids and Iyachtu Xvim –worshiping monsters, including barghests in various stages of life. Yquog was one of them and harbored a grudge against another member of the Legion. Unlike other creatures of the Legion, Yquog was more interested in exchanging favors with the adventurers after they infiltrated the fortress's caves. A Dekanter goblin named Kruntur stole a message sent to Yquog by its master, and failure to follow the message's instruction would incur wrath and dire punishment. Yquog wanted the adventurers to retrieve the message from Kruntur, preferably without slaughtering him and the other Dekanter goblins. As a payment for the service, Yquog offered an enchanted item taken off the corpse of an unlucky adventurer. It was revealed that Kruntur stole the message because Yquog stole magical bracers from his brother, and Kruntur wanted them back. It was unrecorded if the adventurers from Luskan negotiated the exchange of the message for the bracers or decided to move forward using more violent methods.</p>
