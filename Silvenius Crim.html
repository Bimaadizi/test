<p>Silvenius Crim was a wizard agent of the Arcane Brotherhood of the Host Tower of the Arcane and the proprietor of Icewind Enchantments in the town of Targos in Icewind Dale in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Silvenius was a pale-skinned human man with wavy chestnut hair, a sour expression, and the posture of a powerful mage. He preferred transportation through magic to walking.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Silvenius Crim was present at the Host Tower of the Arcane when it was stormed by the Hero of Neverwinter and their companions. The mage witnessed the adventurers cut down members of the Arcane Brotherhood who fell to Maugrim Korothir 's mental domination, including Valindra Shadowmantle , who was killed by the Hero. Silvenius survived, but the experience left him traumatized. Soon after, Silvenius became aware that the Archmage Arcane had returned his favorite wizard, Valindra back to life, believing that she possessed some grand destiny. Silvenius admitted that the Hero of Neverwinter saved the Host Tower of the Arcane despite killing many of its mages.</p>
<p>By Mirtul of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , when the Ten Towns were facing looming destruction by an ancient evil, Silvenius Crim had recently arrived from Luskan and opened Icewind Enchantments, a shop that dealt in magical goods. This venture was not Silvenius's favorite assignment, and he could not stand the backwater town and its coinless inhabitants, but such was his punishment for deserting the Host Tower during the Hero of Neverwinter's assault. Secretly, Silvenius Crim was tasked with manning Icewind Enchantments by his superiors at the Host Tower of the Arcane. He was ordered to perform research in the Art and to seek "economic opportunities."</p>
<p>One such magical research included performing a complex and dangerous ritual of summoning a snow weird . The wizard was to perform the ritual using rare materials provided to him by Luskan. Silvenius was to ask the elemental creature, a font of esoteric knowledge and prognostication of the future, about one topic to pass the knowledge back to the Hosttower. To help him with the ritual as bodyguards, Silvenius Crim acquired the help of the Hero of Neverwinter, who was promised a question of their own. The mage recognized the Hero but he did not consider them an enemy as he cared about magical research more than he cared for the Arcane Brotherhood's goals.</p>
<p>When the snow weird was summoned, Silvenius presented his first query: who or what was threatening the Ten Towns? The weird begged the wizard to be returned back to the elemental pool of snow she was ripped away from, as a snow weird could never survive without it. Nevertheless, the weird answered the mage's question: the ancient demigod of war and winter, Arctus , was about to break out from its prison and lay waste to Icewind Dale. The snow weird raged and begged in pain to be released. Silvenius's second query was at the behest of the Host Tower: what was Valindra Shadowmantle's destiny? The snow weird went berserk in desperation and attacked, yelling the prophesy of Valindra becoming the Scourge of Neverwinter. The Hero was never given an opportunity to ask their question. Still, together with their allies, the group ended up either slaying the desperate elemental or destroying the summoning circle and sending the creature back to the Elemental Plane of Air . As payment for their aid, Silvenius paid the Hero in gold coin. Eventually, Silvenius Crim may have offered aid to the Hero and the Targos Guard when the city was attacked by Arctus and its army. On orders from Speaker Kemp , Silvenius lit huge magical braziers around Targos, offering its people protection against Arctus's deadly dire blizzard.</p>
