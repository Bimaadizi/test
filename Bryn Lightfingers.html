<p>Bryn Lightfingers was a strongheart halfling ranger from a clan in Red Larch in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Though often quick to anger, she also possessed an open mind and was very curious.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bryn's entire family earned a living baking with crumblecake being their staple. When she and her siblings came of age they struck out from home to become adventurers, going their separate ways in the process.</p>
<p>She initially trained with the rangers of Ardeep Forest , and developed a relationship with their leader, Corissa Windroot , who was tasked with the safekeeping of an artifact known as the Infernal Stone . Corissa was however seduced and killed by the succubus Madelith , in an unsuccessful attempt to gain control of the Infernal Stone.</p>
<p>Bryn's training ended when her group band was forced out of the forest by Eldreth Veluuthra . As chance would have it she reunited with brother who encouraged her to join the Order of the Burning Dawn . Bryn eventually earned a position of leadership with the Burning Dawn.</p>
<p>Circa 1487 DR , Bryn was informed that the Infernal Stone had resurfaced, and traced it to a Luskan citizen, who turned out to be under the control of Madelith. With the help of the Champion of the Burning Dawn , the stone was recovered and Madelith banished to the Hells .</p>
