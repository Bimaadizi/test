<p>Koji Kubahachi was a head of the Kubahachi clan and a daimyo of Aru Province in Wa during the early 1700s on the Wa Calendar .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>As a ruler, Koji was a cruel strong-man with a nasty temper and an excessive vindictive streak.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Most notoriously, in Wa Year 1713 (1295 DR) , when Koji levied a special tax to pay for castle improvements and a certain fishing village fell short, Koji killed every inhabitant, razed it, salted the earth, and did the same to two neighboring villages, insisting they must been aware of a plot to defraud him.</p>
<p>In Wa Year 1717 (1299 DR) , two ninjas infiltrated Aru disguised as pilgrims and tried to assassinate Koji. They were killed in the attack, Koji couldn't identify who hired them, and in revenge and as a message to his unknown enemy, he executed every one of the pilgrims in the train. At this excess, shogun Masanori gave Koji "permission" to "take the final step on the road of life", and returned the daimyate to the Matsutomo clan, under Masakito Matsutomo .</p>
