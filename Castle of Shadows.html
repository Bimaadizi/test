<p>The Castle of Shadows was the main base of the evil malaugrym and of their leaders, who held the title of Shadowmaster .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The castle was located on the Plane of Shadow .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The castle imparted the ability to shapechange on all humans who entered it, although leaving the Plane of Shadow caused this ability to fade. This led to shapechanging effects that began triggering at random, requiring great fortitude to suppress. The phenomenon led some to believe that the malaugrym 's shapechanging abilities might not be innate, but were instead a result of dwelling within the castle.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The castle was built by the wizard Malaug sometime prior to his siring of the malaugrym race.</p>
<p>During the Harpstar Wars ( 1182 â€“ 1222 DR ), the malaugrym of the Castle of Shadows fought against the Harpers as well as their powerful allies, Elminster and Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , about 100 malaugrym occupied the castle. Older malaugrym would generally retire to the castle.</p>
