<p>The Armories of the illithid city of Oryndoll were located all throughout the city.</p>
<p>They stored weapons and armor that were needed to equip an army of thralls. They were heavily guarded in the event of another thrall uprising. Most tzakandi under the control of the Tamer Creed were stationed in barracks around the arenas that lay at the core of each armory.</p>
