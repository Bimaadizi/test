<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally, rings of power created on the behest of Mynseril Lostbone a powerful Malarite priest. He cherished blood-soaked brawls and wanted to find a way to prolong the ferocious pleasure. Mynseril started studying trolls and their uncanny regenerative powers, eventually coming up with the idea to outfit the most savage warriors with regenerative magics. Mynseril Lostbone commissioned the creation of rings of power and routinely gifted them to the strongest warriors from opposing factions who were to meet on the battlefield against each other.</p>
<p>In 1372 DR , regular and lesser rings of power were available for purchase in the Temple of Tyr of Port Llast , from cleric named Neurik and later in Beorunna's Well . The same year, Oleff Uskar of the Hall of Justice in Neverwinter offered these rings to his allies in the war with Luskan .</p>
<p>Circa 1372 DR, several powerful magical items were brought to Toril by a planeswalking wizard Vejoni H. Wyzz who pitched his extraplanar tent just outside the town of Liam's Hold . Lesser rings of power could be found in his collection.</p>
