<p>The Fallen Lands were a barren area of the Savage Frontier , home to many monsters and even more mysteries. In the mid-to-late 14 th century, it was beset with dead-magic zones , areas of wild magic and random discharges of witchfire .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>They were located just west of the Anauroch desert, along one side of the Triangle of Trees . The Far Forest was located to its north, while the Weathercote Wood was situated to its south.</p>
<h2>Geographical Features</h2>
<p>The rolling hills and scrublands of the Fallen Lands appeared rather ordinary during the daytime hours. At night, strange and seemingly in inexplicable radiances appeared in sporadic locations.</p>
<p>The area held scores of ruins that served as reminders of ancient cities and the battles that brought them down. It was a favored destination for treasure-seekers and other adventurers alike.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These lands were once part of the realm of Netheril , home to those not powerful enough to reside within the empire's famous floating cities. Some 14 th -century sages argued many of these mages migrated southward, and ultimately settled Halruaa .</p>
<p>During the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , Zhentarim agents actively scoured the area looking for ancient Netherese relics .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , unidentified flying creatures were seen flying in the skies over the region.</p>
<p>After Hellgate Keep fell in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , many of the fiends of the Far Forest ventured south into the Fallen Lands.</p>
<p>Around the same time, a pair of adventurers, Vanthorm and Haladan , claimed they saw an enormous beholder leading bands of hobgoblins in their capture of bestial creatures with the goal of breeding them.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>There were some local rumors that powerful mages dwelled within the southern Fallen Lands and used their magic to keep away the evil beings of Hellgate Keep.</p>
<p>The motes of light that appeared at night were believed by some to be the after-effects of ancient arcane spells.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Only monstrous creatures were known to inhabit the Fallen Lands. These ranged from the more common leucrottas , doppelgangers , gricks , harpies , and nagas , to the more rarely encountered displacer beasts , krenshars , gray renders and gibbering mouthers .</p>
<p>Several tribes of orcs dwelled within this area for some time. In the southern reaches of the Fallen Lands, these tribes were all ruled by petty kings and constantly feuded with another—these included the Black Bone , Black Slasher , Seven Eye , and Severed Fist tribes. They all showed fealty the Bloody Scar and their shaman –king Ogrash , a tribe that ruled over the northern reaches of the Fallen Lands and the bordering Greypeak Mountains. All of the tribes used axe beaks as mounts , fighting atop them with lances and shortbows .</p>
