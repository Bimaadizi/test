<p>Nivian was a city in the ancient Illefarn that existed in the -13 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>The most notable tradition of the ancient Nivian was the annual non-lethal grand melee championship between champions of the city's six districts. The reward for the winner was fame, while the winning district gained possession of a certain stature that depicted a local hero. In order to avoid chaos, each district selected its champion from a set of willing individuals who eagerly received the patronage of the district's noble families.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the −1239 DR , Nivian's Artisan's District selected its champion – Beloran , who showed impressive commitment and drive to become the championship's winner. Beloran reprinted his district six years in a row, never claiming the grand title. The man was madly in love with the city ruler's niece – Ilum Lura , and Beloran's only goal was to gain her favor. However, Ilum showed little interest in the Artisan's District's champion, always politely turning him down. Ilum's father exercised his civic pride by ordering the beautiful woman to give Beloran a token of her favor, a set of enchanted riding gloves, many centuries later known as the Favor of Ilum Lura . Beloran accepted her reluctant gift and pinned it to his sword arm shoulder, as the tradition dictated.</p>
<p>Inspired by the token, the champion fought fiercer than ever and claimed the grand title of Nivian's champion for the first time. Now Ilum Lura, who offered her token of favor, owed the champion a kiss, another traditional reward for the winner. Beloran received his kiss, but Ilum left the love-stricken champion immediately after. For several months after his win, Beloran continued his fruitless attempts to kindle a relationship with the beautiful noblewoman. Exhausted of his advances, Ilum agreed to meet with Beloran, only to inform him that her heart belonged to another.</p>
<p>Heartbroken and driven mad by his unrequited love, Beloran left Nivian, never to e seen again. Those who witnessed the champion's departure said that he still wore the Favor of Ilum Lura pinned on his sword arm shoulder.</p>
