<p>Fleshslough was the divine realm of Yurtrus , the orc deity of death and disease .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>In the Great Wheel cosmology , Fleshslough was located inside of a hill in Oinos in Hades . Practically nothing was known about the realm's geography. This was due to a lack of reports about it, because nobody—including avatars —ever returned from the realm after entering it.</p>
<p>In the World Tree cosmology , Fleshslough was located on the plane of Nishrek on a big hill.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Yurtrus ruled the realm.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Orcish petitioners of Nishrek told among themselves that orcs with poor fighting skills were stripped of their flesh in Fleshslough. This was a fearsome prospect for them because on Nishrek, people who died in battle were revived, so being stripped of flesh was the closest thing to true death there.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>The entry into Fleshslough was marked by a big door made of iron. Every time this door opened, the stink of death came out of the realm.</p>
