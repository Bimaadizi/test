<p>The Orc Road was the thoroughfare between Amnian cities of Crimmor and Purskul .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Orc Road was the name given to a patch of the Trade Way in Zehoarastria region between Crimmor and Purskul. Farms, family estates, and small agricultural communities filled the stretch of the road, providing the two cities with grains and produce.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The road's name derived from it being used by orcish hoards that descended from the Cloud Peaks several times through Amn's history, including the Year of the Black Horde, 1235 DR and the Year of the Lost Lady, 1241 DR . These two events lead to a large half-orc population in the town of Purskul and the nearby communities. Orc survivors from the failed invasions were enslaved, and their labor was used to pave and maintain the Orc Road.</p>
<p>Sometime circa the Year of the Tooth, 1270 DR , brutal Lord Alathallgo Gathalynker of the Gathalynker family was murdered and, allegedly, eaten by his orcish slaves on the Orc Road. The Lord's body was hastily buried somewhere along the road. In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , Alathallgo's skull adorned in his ornate enchanted helmet was unearthed, but the rest of magical armor and other wondrous items were still believed lost, and buried along the Orc Road. As of the late 14 th century DR , the Gathalynkers continued the search for Alathallgo's magical equipment under cover of night, despite the local government's protests and drovers driving their carriages into excavated holes late into the evening.</p>
