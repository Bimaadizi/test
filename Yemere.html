<p>Yemere was a steel dragon who lived in the disguise of a young windsoul genasi in Akanûl . He was a participant in the draconic game of Xorvintaal and was allied with the gray dragon Vairshekellabex . Yemere traveled with Aoth Fezim's expedition into the Akanapeaks to kill Vairshekellabex. He charmed a young stormsoul genasi named Son-liin and forced her to take actions to harm the expedition.</p>
<p>One night, Gaedynn Ulraes remained awake all night and followed Son-liin to her rendezvous with Yemere where he attacked the dragon. Yemere nearly defeated Gaedynn but Aoth heard the fighting and brought his genasi allies and together they killed Yemere.</p>
