<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1400 DR , Rakor and a Cult of the Dragon army battled a force of the Uthgardt Elk tribe for control of the helmet of disjunction , a relic with the power to break all magic . In the conflict known as the Battle of the Evermoors , the Elk warriors outnumbered the Dragon Cultists, but Rakor more than made up for that by flying overhead and vomiting acid on the barbarians' ranks. Stanhard ordered a retreat and entrusted the helmet to his fastest rider, Ven Salafin , to get it away from Rakor however he could, before the chief was dissolved as well. Ven passed it to Xenk Yendar as he too died, and the paladin would hide it away and remember the Elk tribe's brave sacrifice in defense of the helm.</p>
