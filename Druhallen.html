<p>Druhallen was a particularly talented mage that traveled the Western Heartlands during the midâ€“14 th century DR . He famously ventured into the mines of Dekanter along with his old flame Rozt'a , her foster son Tiep , and a particularly well-mannered goblin to save the life of his longtime friend Galimer , and wound up recovering an ancient artifact from the lost empire of Netheril .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He had an unassuming appearance that was far more befitting a laborer than a wielder of the arcane arts . Druhallen had a square head, with slightly-larger-than-average features, that sat atop a laborer's frame.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Druhallen was a stubborn and plain-speaking man that did not mince words. He maintained a rather reserved demeanor and seldom let his emotions get the better of him, except under the most stressful or distressing circumstances.</p>
<p>He was not one to think about "what ifs" or otherwise think about what could have been. As soon things played out in his life, he only considered what actions could he take given his current circumstances.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Dru demonstrated great aptitude for spellcasting even at a young age, developing his own minor cantrips without any training in the arcane arts.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Like his brother Galimer, Druhallen worked his spells from a "spellbook" that was rather unique in design. He used a finely-crafted box with many little compartments that stored the reagents he used for spellcasting.</p>
<p>Rather than wield a quarterstaff like many other wizards , Druhallen carried with him an ax -handle, a weapon more befitting the son of a carpenter.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Druhallen served as the premiere mage of his traveling group, in part by ensuring their safety with the use of magical wards . Just as Galimer did, Dru studied for and prepared his arcane spells just after midnight.</p>
<p>Throughout much of his journeys, Druhallen spent much of his time collecting a group of rare and valuable spell reagents in order to cast a single scrying spell that he believed would offer him and Galimer some insight into their shared past. Among the components he had collected were a perfectly-formed pearl , a bone taken from a mummy , and some blood collected from an actual dragon .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Dru's father was a carpenter, as was his father before him. Even at a young age Druhallen stood out from his family in Sunderath .</p>
<p>From their time together under Ansoain's care and tutelage, Druhallen and Galimer became the closest of freinds, spending nearly all their time together. For a long time, Dru never considered the fact they would not be a part of each others' lives, even as old men in their twilight years.</p>
<p>On two occasions in his life did Druhallen attempt to form a connection with an animal as a familiar . His childhood pet cat could not focus enough for the bond, and a certain parrot he encountered was far too self-centered.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Druhallen was raised alongside five older brothers in the village of Sunderath. When the mage Ansoain witness the young boy's innate arcane talents in the Year of the Boot, 1343 DR , she adopted Dru as an apprentice from his father for a mere twenty silver . From that day on Dru joined Ansoain and her son Galimer for a life on the road, learning more about magic during their travels across the Western Heartlands. The lives of the three mages changed dramatically in the Year of the Arch, 1353 DR , when the caravan with which they were traveling was ambushed by Red Wizard and their undead minions while en route from Elversult eastward towards Hlondeth . Ansoain was killed and the two boys were left alone save for one another.</p>
<p>Druhallen and Galimer continued on their work for a few years, eventually taking on the services of the bodyguard Rozt'a around the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR . Druhallen and Rozt'a felt immediate mutual attraction for one another and found themselves in a steady relationship. It came to an abrupt end however, when Rozt'a revealed to Druhallen she was pregnant and he responded with abject panic. Dru abandoned Roz and Galimer alike in Berdusk and did not return to them until the following Spring. Despite his callow and weak-willed response, Druhallen was offered a sincere welcome back by his friends. While Rozt'a lost her unborn daughter, she and Galimer had married, and the couple had even taken on a young boy from the streets of Berdusk as their own son.</p>
<p>The company traveled together for nearly another decade, periodically making effort to take revenge on the Red Wizards that had taken Ansoain's life and uncover more of the secrets that surrounded its circumstances. In the Year of the Wyvern, 1363 DR Druhallen spent a summer at Candlekeep , with the hopes of learning more about the glass disk the pair had recovered from the ambush site. Within five years time, Dru and Galimer had killed three of the Red Wizards with the intent to get revenge on the others. In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Dru finally convinced Dru and Rozt'a to delve into the mines of Dekanter to more fully understand exactly what sort of magic they had encountered that day. They traveled from Llorkh to Parnast , in order to follow the Dawn Pass Trail south through the Greypeak Mountains into Dekanter, but their plans were halted due to interference by the Lord Amarandaris . Just as they were left without and prospects, Druhallen met a surprisingly well-mannered goblin named Sheemzher , who requested that the group come meet his mistress, the mysterious and magical being known as Lady Wyndyfarh .</p>
<p>Despite having Sheemzher as a guide, the journey through Weathercote Wood to the Lady's glade proved dangerous. Careless and harmful actions taken by the young lad Tiep drew the ire of Lady Wyndyfarh. She accused the group of defiling her forest, claimed Galimer as a hostage and tasked them with quest as recompense for their transgressions: the group would continue their journey through the Greypeaks into Dekanter, and recover one of the lost Nether Scroll of ancient Netheril , and bring it back to the Lady of the Forest within her grove. The expedition through the mountains and into the mines proved much more perilous than the hike through Weathercote. The group suffered numerous injuries, quarreled with one another, and were even forced to sacrifice one of their horses to appease a band of goblins.</p>
<p>In the depths of the mines, the group faced down the malevolent undead being known as the Beast Lord . Dru set the example for the group, putting himself in harm's way first to offer up the best chance of successfully recovering the Nether Scroll and having Galimer back in their lives. The rest of the party banded together, recovered the scroll, and distracted the Beast Lord long enough for everyone to make it out alive. As the party journeyed back to Weathercote, Druhallen was given the opportunity to read from the Nether Scroll himself and learn some of the fundamental truths about magic that escaped so many spellcasters in the Realms. Upon their arrival, Dru, Rozt'a, and Tiep were reunited with Galimer, and the two mages that grew up with one another were afforded an audience with the Lady of the Forest. They three talked of the secrets of Dekanter, Lady Wyndyfarh shared some about her past, and the two mages were offered some insight into the mysterious disk that guided their journey across the Heartlands towards Dekanter, all while under a night's sky that was not the same one normally seen throughout their place in the Realms.</p>
<p>After they returned to Parnast, Druhallen made one final deal with Lord Amarandaris to ensure his family's safety moving forward. He offered the Zhent ruler a copy of the first portion of the Nether Scroll in exchange for his word that the Black Network would forget about Dru and his companions, and act as if they had never known one another at all.</p>
