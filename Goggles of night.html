<p>Goggles of night were a pair of dark lenses that allowed their wearer to see in darkness.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Goggles of night granted the wearer darkvision out to a range of 60 feet (18 meters). The darkvision of creatures that already had this ability was enhanced by increasing the range of the darkvision by 60 feet (18 meters).</p>
<p>An armored version of the goggles of night existed in Northwest Faerûn . The goggles of night were integrated into an enchanted helmet as two dark and opaque crystal lenses inlaid in the helmets' eyeholes. The crystals allowed the helmet's wearer to see normally and granted them darkvision.</p>
