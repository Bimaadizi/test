<p>Tiki plants were flowering herbs with curative properties that were found in the Malatran jungles, exclusively in areas of high humidity and abundant sunlight.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Stems of tiki plants were between 2 feet (0.61 meters) and 4 feet (1.2 meters) in length and their wide leaves were an easy identifier. Tikis produced large white flowers with violet centers. The only usable part of the plant was its extremely bitter sandy brown root. Malatrans knew that when roots were boiled, they created a thick fetid and bitter curative draught that could slow poison when consumed. The curative effects of the concoction were ineffective if the consumer did not rest after drinking the pungent potion.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 14 th century DR , roots of the tiki plant were known to be gifted to goodly travelers by the lesser nature spirits of a Malatran vanilla grove named Timon and Pumba .</p>
