<p>The King's Arch was a famous and important bridge in Amn .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The bridge crossed the River Esmel with the South Road , halfway between Gambiton and Esmeltaran .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The bridge was made of solid stone in a simple design.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The bridge was built early in the reign of King Esmel Torlath I in the 5 th century DR as part of the infrastructure development of the kingdom of Amn.</p>
<p>By the 14 th century DR the bridge was in mild disrepair, and the flagstones needed replacing. The venerable bridge met its end on Eleasis 8 at the start of the Sothillisian War , when the invading Skullgnashers and Spearbiters passed over it on the way to Esmeltaran. After they crossed, the hill giants smashed the bridge in order to prevent Amnians from Esmeltaran from escaping in that direction.</p>
