<p>Deathcap mushrooms were a species of unassuming but very poisonous fungi found in the Savage Frontier on the Northwest Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deathcaps appeared to be almost indistinguishable from the harmless varieties of mushrooms that grew in the cavers along the northern coast – grey stalk and skirt with a green cap atop. The only distinguishable feature was that deathcaps grew a bit bigger in size than their neighbors. Deathcap mushrooms were treacherous fungi – they tasted positively delicious but were a deadly poison.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, Aleema Meddlebrook , who traveled along the Trade Way from Neverwinter to the city of Luskan with Tollin 's caravan, sought to harvest deathcap mushrooms from a cave near to where the caravan was ambushed bu bandits. She asked the Champion of the Burning Dawn and their companions to retrieve the fungi if they were to stumble across some. Aleena advised the heroes not to eat any of the deathcaps.</p>
