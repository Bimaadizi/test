<p>The Annals of Halgren was an adventuring group assembled by Halgren Death's Head , a member of the dwarven Bruenghor Clan , active circa 1310 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Annals of Halgren was established circa the Year of the Starfall, 1300 DR , by Halgren Death's Head and his wife, Alia Shield-Maiden . The couple of shield dwarves started their adventuring career in the Sunset Mountains , Bruenghor Clan's home. Halgren's family was haunted by alledged tainted blood. One of his ancestors was a duergar criminal named Kaervas , and in attempts to wipe foul reputation from his family name, Halgren Death's Head set out to earn gold and treasures. For a decade, Halgren and Alia traveled together until the Year of Storms, 1310 DR , when they gathered a band of mercenaries in Luskan , eager to earn gold and fame.</p>
<p>The first recruit was a human ranger named Bastinado , who's traveled the Realms and wore many hats. With time, he became the group's heart, keeping their spirits high. Amnian monk Silence-Before-Iron was the second to join the group. The air of mystery surrounded the woman. Her lower planes parentage and monastic tradition were kept secret by her vow of silence. Mordakai of Thay was once a member of the Red Wizards but abandoned them after his sorcerous gifts became public. Lastly, Kei the Wooden Idol , a spirited half-elf rogue, joined the group. Her claims of being an actual wooden idol brought to life raised many eyebrows.</p>
