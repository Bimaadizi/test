<p>The Ahtahqugotak Sea was a body of water in Ibelgrak Valley in Angalpuk on the Great Glacier .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Ahtahqugotak Sea was the largest sea in Angalpuk, at almost 70 miles (110 kilometers) across at its widest point, but also quite shallow, being only 75 feet (23 meters) deep. In winter, it was covered in thick ice, and in spring this broke apart as platform ice. In summer, it was nearly ice-free. Its waters were clear and calm, while it shores were dense with white birches and lush evergreens , making it possibly the most picturesque sea on the Great Glacier.</p>
<p>Its waters were fertile with game fish, such as bloatfish , black burners , and polar cod . The surrounding area was almost free of predators and hunters, so caribou , musk oxen , and many kinds of birds were abundant.</p>
<h2>Legends</h2>
<p>Despite the abundant game animals and fish, many Angulutiuns avoided the Ahtahqugotak, fearing the fever virus that had spread from the Ibelgrak Valley in the Year of Scorching Suns, 460 DR , to kill thousands. However, there was no evidence that the disease lurked in the Ahtahqugotak water or the local wildlife.</p>
