<p>Corstal , also infrequently known as petalite , was a rare mineral and especially hard to find without impurities. They were worn by nomadic tribes and those that could not afford better jewelry.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These ornamental stones were fairly hard but brittle and ranged in hue from colorless to pink. The rare stone that was free of impurities could be faceted , but otherwise these stones were cut cabochon . A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Corstal crystals could become light sources for a short time by exposing them to magically generated radiance. Any source of light from fairie fire to flame strike that touched a corstal gem was mimicked in the heart of the crystal as it glowed with the same hue and intensity for a few minutes before fading away suddenly. The longest duration of this mirroring behavior ever observed was twenty-four minutes.</p>
