<p>Cassana's wand was a uniquely powerful artifact created by Cassana to control her servants and prolong her life.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cassana's wand was an 18 inches (0.46 meters) long slender blue wand of crystal that shimmered with power.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Cassana locked a big portion of her own magic in the wand, making it a uniquely powerful artifact with three major known functions. The wand was effectively a potion of longevity , sustaining Cassana's youth and lifeforce long past the human woman's natural lifespan as long as she possessed it.</p>
<p>She was using the wand to control her undead ex-lover Zrie Prakis . His lichdom was tied to the wand itself, the further away he was from the wand the more lifeless he became, sprouting back to his cursed existence when the wand was in the vicinity again.</p>
<p>And lastly, the wand allowed Cassana to control her construct, the Puppet, also known as Alias , along with any and all creatures she summoned (like her infamous Kalmari lent out to the Iron Throne ).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1357 DR , Cassana was using her wand to take control of Alias , and subduing her companions. When Alias' friends came to her aid, the wand was lost in a portal, taking away Cassana's longevity and a portion of her power. The wand left the Prime Material Plane and destroyed Zrie Prakis, who murdered Cassana in his final moments. Phalse recovered the wand and attempted to control Alias with it one again, but with Cassana dead, the will of the warrior overpowered the item's enchantments causing an explosion that took Phalse's arm with it.</p>
