<p>Shanzezim was a marid clockmaker who inhabited the abandoned Waterclock Guild's Crypts in Neverwinter in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to the Waterclock Guild 's destruction, Shanzezim, alongside several other water elementals , were conjured and bound to the guild's crypts. When the members of the guild abandoned the premises, all of the bound creatures and several of the guild's clockwork mechanisms were left behind.</p>
<p>Shanzezim was certain of the guild's destruction, but he was reluctant to test the strength of the magical binding to make an escape. He spent almost all his time in this sort of captivity trying to re-build one of the Waterclock Guild's most complex clocks. By the late 1490s DR , he believed that finishing assembling the clock shouldn't take him more than a few years.</p>
