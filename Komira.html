<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the Elturian tieflings were outcast and forced to live as refugees across the Sword Coast . Fortunately, they found temporary refuge at the Emerald Grove druidic enclave for a time. The feeling of security the grove provided was short-lived however, as the newly-appointed archdruid Kagha attempted to seal away the tieflings using a powerful ritual .</p>
<p>While at the Emerald Grove, Komira and Locke's daughter Arabella was caught stealing the Idol of Silvanus from the grove, in an attempt to prevent the druids from casting the ritual. She was taken by Kagha and forced to answer for her crime. Komira, Locke, and several of their friends tried to get Arabella to safety but were turned away by members of the Emerald Enclave .</p>
