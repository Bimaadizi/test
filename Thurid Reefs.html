<p>The Thurid Reefs , formerly known as Thuridru , was a city turned close group of coral reefs in the Sea of Fallen Stars .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The reefs were said by Elminster to be colorful and quite beautiful.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This area was originally founded as the city of Thuridru in 216 DR , as part of the merfolk kingdom of Eadraal .</p>
<p>In early 11 th century DR Thuridru became immersed in a territorial skirmish with ixitxachitl over some of the kelp beds along the slopes west of Mount Teakal and Voalidru . In 1073 TS (1003 DR) , the ruling Kamaar Clan willfully broke one of the Laws of Battle of Serôs by sending five war parties out to the Holy Reefs of the ixitxachitl, wherein they destroyed one of the 'chitl cities through an ignoble ambush. For their violation of the Laws of Battle, Eadraal's then-king Kosul I chose to punish Clan Kamaar by having them exiled to the Xedran Reefs and forced to resettle upon the site of their crime. There they would go on to found a new settlement under the same name as their old one, Thuridru .</p>
<p>Ever since its abandonment, the city became a place that was shunned by most merfolk. Over time, numerous corals and reefs grew up around the city, until it became known as the Thurid Reefs by 1290 DR .</p>
