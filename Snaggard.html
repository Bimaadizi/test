<p>Farmer Snaggard was an inhabitant of the town of Ghars in Cormyr in the midâ€“14 th century DR . He lived a long way down the west swamp road near Ghars.</p>
<p>Since the days of his youth, Snaggard had a liking for the West Fennet Number Three variety of pipeweed . He even grew a small plot of it for personal use each year on his farm, and because the tobacconist in Ghars refused to stock it.</p>
<p>Snaggard was also a regular of the Swamp Rat tavern, and was there on Eleint 17 , 1367 DR . Benelaius used these facts in a display of his powers of observation, deducing that Jasper had also been to the Swamp Rat.</p>
