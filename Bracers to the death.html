<p>During the 1360's, rumors circulated that they were still worn by those who engaged in feats of competitive combat. In truth they had been in the possession of the mage Davaeorn , who had been working as an agent of the Iron Throne within the mines beneath the Cloak Wood forest.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR they had come into the possession of another wizard Mekrath , who had imprisoned the tiefling performer Haer'Dalis beneath the Temple District of Athkatla .</p>
