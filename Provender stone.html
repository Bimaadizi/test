<p>Provender stones were a type of strange fruit that grew only on the plane of Acheron .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Provender stones were cubical in shape, black in coloration, and rather earthy and woody in texture. They had seeds that were white in coloration. They grew constantly upon the Battleplains of Acheron, as well as within the humid tunnels of some of the plane's cubes. They could reach tremendously large sizes, growing as big as a house and beyond.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>These fruit were edible, though not particularly appetizing. All of the spirit legions that inhabited the Battleplains of Acheron relied upon provender stones for sustenance. The regulations of each army required that combatants plant the seeds of these fruit as soon as possible after consumption and all of the major legions would punish failure to do so with immediate execution.</p>
<p>Beyond the spirit legions, various species of birds on the Plane of Acheron were also known to subsist on provender stones. These included blood hawks , gulls , pigeons , ravens , sparrows , swallows , and vultures .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After being trapped on the Blue Cube by Lei Kung , the blue dragon Teslor was forced to subsist off of provender stones.</p>
<p>Sometime in the 14 th century DR , a group of adventurers from Ravens Bluff visited the plane of Acheron. There they came upon the hassitorium Ishtavarek and its captain, Estrak Longtooth . When they inquired with the half-orc as to how people survived on the plane, he responded that the primary means of sustenance for most was provender stones.</p>
