<p>Horel was a drug and poison created by distilling a freshwater lily pad plant called halfling's hand , also known as oxhrel, and mixing it in a certain secret proportion with powdered horseradish .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The resulting substance was a green liquid, harmless to skin contact or ingestion. However, if a needle or a weapon was coated with horel and the substance entered the bloodstream, the victim started violently convulsing, which dramatically affected their ability to defend oneself in battle or perform a simple task requiring a steady hand.</p>
