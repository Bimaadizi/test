<p>Othiiyr Velthrann was a sage of the city of Tsurlagol in the Vast in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>His life's work was his study of the magic swords of the Royal Guard of King Imphras I and King Imbrar I of Impiltur . These swords were among Soargar's Legacy , a collection of the relics of Old Impiltur put together by Mage Royal Soargar , but long since lost. Othiiyr dedicated himself to recording the legends around them, and pieced together the histories of eleven surviving swords: Ashram ; Dornavver , or Demonbane; Ellendrin , the Weeping Blade; Felthann , or Liluth's Summertongue; Galathos ; Iltornar , the Goretooth; Malagar , the Burnfang; Palreth ; Sarghathuld , or Orcbane; Tendar , the Wailer; and Ulfindos , the Corsair Scourge.</p>
<p>Othiiyr assisted the Knights of Imphras II in their continuing quest to find the lost swords of Soargar's Legacy.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He was able to examine at least one of these swords himself when, in the Year of the Behir, 1342 DR , the thief Gort brought him Ellendrin to identify. Othiiyr offered to buy the sword, but Gort refused, hinting that a contact in the Moonsea had already contracted him to retrieve it. Gort left Othiiyr's house and that was the last anyone admitted to seeing the thief and Ellendrin again.</p>
<p>In the late 1350s DR, an unnamed female human adventurer presented another magic sword to Othiiyr for identification. He found it to be the famed lost Telvaran's Enchanted Blade . But the client teleported away without even paying, so Othiiyr revealed the finding to othersâ€”when a client didn't pay, it was permitted to break the traditional bond of secrecy meant to exist between sages and clients.</p>
<p>He was still working with the Knights as of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , though the above swords were still missing.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Othiiyr was a regular correspondent with fellow sage Elminster of Shadowdale , and told him all about the swords Ashram , Ellendrin , Galathos , Malagar , and Sarghathuld .</p>
