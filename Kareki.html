<p>Karaki was a farming community and one of the many isolated villages of the Fochu Peninsula in Wa . It was known for being the former home of the famous Peachling Girl .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kareki was a more prosperous village than most in the region, because it had good farming.</p>
<p>Most of the structures within the village were simple peasant shacks known as minka , built from wood with latticed walls and straw-thatched roofs. Apart from these poor residences were small barns, warehouses, and shops. At the center of the village was a little courtyard containing two sculptures, one memorializing the village's founder Hoteo , the other signifying the freedom-fighter Oe-Ura , also known as the Peachling Girl, and her pets.</p>
<p>As a whole, the people of Karaki were much more welcoming of strangers than other settlements of the peninsula.</p>
<p>The hamlet had a population of about 340 individuals after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR) .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Kareki was located along the Nanaichi River near the western edge of the Momoben Forest on the western side of the Fochu Peninsula of Tsukishima . A trail led west from the village to the settlement of Utumoi on the coast.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Villages in Wa were run by an administrator known as a shoya , typically a minor samurai , and Kareki was no different in this respect. The shoya could call upon a local militia if needed. The shoya of Kareki after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR) was Oshikochi Tanan .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The cost to spend the night in one of the small minkas was 4 fen . The village did not produce anything more expensive than 4 yuan to sell.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>About 34 citizens of Kareki served in its militia. These persons were only armed with simple clubs or spears .</p>
<h2>Religion</h2>
<p>Like most of the villages of the Peninsula, the people of Kareki were followers of the Path of Enlightenment . Unlike the other settlements, however, they did not demand a test of faith from strangers and were more welcoming of those of other faiths.</p>
<h2>Notable Inhabitants</h2>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kareki was an ancient settlement, being founded as early as around Wa Year 770 (352 DR) by a man named Hoteo, who was in truth sent from the Celestial Empire to reign in the rebellious coiled dragon Za-Jikku . Hoteo created a magical copper hammer with which to defeat the dragon, but instead, Za-Jikku defeated Hoteo. The gods transformed Hoteo into a statue, which rose up from the very ground and stood in the middle of the village. It still held the copper hammer for a thousand years.</p>
<p>Sometime around Wa Year 1750 (1332 DR) , a poor farmer from Kareki was fishing in the Nanaichi River when he discovered a floating peach. The beach burst open to reveal a baby girl. The farmer took the child home to Kareki, and he and his wife raised the orphan. She grew up to be Oe-Ura, a river spirit folk who became a champion for the poor commoners of the region.</p>
<p>Her fame concerned the daimyo , and he ordered her to be executed. Her parents hid her in Momoben forest, and he had them executed instead.</p>
<p>Sometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), the same Za-Jikku who had defeated Kareki's founder began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical butterflies , the breath of which would create yun ch'i , the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever.</p>
<p>Around the same time, a band of brigands known as the Blue Kumi Bandits stole the copper hammer from Hoteo's statue and took it with them deep into the Momoben Forest.</p>
<p>However, the hammer ended up at the bottom of a lake in the forest, within a treasure chest, which had fallen into the water when the bandits were attacked by a giant carp living in the lake.</p>
<p>Also at about the same time, in an unrelated occurrence, the shoya nearly died from an allergic reaction to a bee sting!</p>
