<p>The Mielikkar was a mysterious creature of the High Forest that was sacred to the goddess Mielikki , the Forest Queen.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time in the 14 th century DR , a merchant of Mirabar hired the ranger and master tracker Treahugh Greiko to track the Mielikkar in the High Forest. Although Treahugh had never before heard of this beast and had a bad feeling about it, the pay was much too good to pass up and he set his misgivings aside. And so Treahugh, the merchant, and seven bearers set out and managed to track the Mielikkar down. The merchant took aim with an oversized crossbow and loosed the bolt. Though the recoil knocked the small fellow over, the quarrel flew true and struck the Mielikkar in the heart; it thrashed and died. And as it did, Treahugh understood he'd committed a grave crime against his goddess, Mielikki. He lost all his divinely granted ranger abilities and all sense of closeness with the Supreme Ranger. In his grief and despair, Treahugh pulled out his hair, tore off his clothes, and wept. By 1370 DR , he worked as a veterinarian in Conyberry in penance.</p>
