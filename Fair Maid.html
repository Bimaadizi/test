<h2>History</h2>
<p>The tavern was visited by Elminster in the mid–8 th century; there, he had Caladaster and Baerdagh over for a meal in exchange for information on Scorchstone Hall . Ilbryn Starym turned up asking about him a few days later, but did not buy anything; they warned him that Elminster had since headed for the Dead Place .</p>
<p>Another few days later, Tabarast , Beldrune , and an unnamed Harper turned up, also asking about Elminster; Caladaster Daermree joined them, and warned them about the Slayer , something that haunted the Dead Place. Baerdagh was also revealed to be the Lion of Elversult, an old hero, and was goaded into talking about his exploits.</p>
<p>Later, while Tabarast, Beldrune, and Caladaster were telling their tale of meeting Azuth at Karsus' Keep , the undead sorceress Sharindala entered the tavern. She asked for the dress robe that Tabarast had received from Azuth as a reward; as he refused, Caladaster gave his own clothes over to her, and she took him over to her home to discuss something.</p>
