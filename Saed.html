<p>Saed was a vampire and the preeminent beast chieftain of Veldorn throughout the 11 th to 15 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Saed was a melancholy character, always thinking about his lost wealth. He found peace only when he used his powers to mediate the beast chieftains' disputes.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Sometimes Saed thieved off the Shining South caravans that traveled Veldorn. He normally mediated all disputes between his fellow beast chieftains, thanks to his abilities and his psionic powers .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Once Saed was a member of Chakka Baroda and the wealthiest merchant of Turelve as of the early 11 th century DR. Thus, as a Durpari custom, he was also elected nawab . Saed became more and more powerful but did not want to share his wealth with his chaka fellows. So he discreetly started searching for a way to achieve immortality by means of potions of longevity .</p>
<p>One day in the Year of the Chevalier, 1048 DR , a very friendly visitor arrived in his court, offering immortality in exchange for an oath to Shar . Saed agreed and the visitor brought him to the ruins of Old Vaelen ; where he turned Saed into a vampire slave. He went back to his city as a puppet of his master. When his chaka discovered the matter, they sent adventurers to kill the vampires but slew only Saed's master. Saed survived and escaped. Afterward, Chakka Baroda put out a story about his disappearance and continued to rule.</p>
<p>Saed went back to Old Vaelen and settled there. In time, the surrounding beast chieftains started to appreciate his diplomatic skills and soon Saed became the arbiter of all disputes in Veldorn. He also convinced the other beast chieftains to make a mutual alliance to destroy outside invasions.</p>
<p>When the Datharathi chaka rose to power in the 15 th century, Saed manipulated their hired adventuring bands to make forays into the Beastlands and remove any potential rivals for his power.</p>
