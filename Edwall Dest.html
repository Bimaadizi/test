<p>Edwall Dest , was a Duke from the town of Spandeliyon in Aglarond sometime before 1368 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Duke Edwall Dest lived sometime between the years of the Year of the Moonlight Tapestry, 1170 DR and the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR . For several years, the man was locked in a bitter rivalry with the Duke of Delthuntle , the man who was only remembered as Raymond . Eventually, their antagonism reached its climax in a sharpshooting competition. The winner of the competition was to be declared the superior archer between the two. Dukes Raymond and Edwall both wielded powerful enchanted bows . Raymond's weapon, later known as Dead Shot , was stolen by orders of the Duke of Spandeliyon before the competition. Edwall entered the shooting match confident in his advantage, exulting in his inevitable victory. However, Duke Raymond planned a surprise of his own. He demanded his opponent demonstrate his proficiency in sharpshooting on a scarecrow that bore an eerie resemblance to Edwall Dest himself. The Duke of Spandeliyon aimed and sent an arrow straight at the dummy's head. He did not miss and split the target's head in two. At the same time as the poppet 's head split, so did Duke Dest's.</p>
