<p>Keryvian (also known as Foebane or Demron's Bane ) was one of the Baneblades of Demron , variously described as a mighty hand-and-a-half broadsword or one-handed bastard sword .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Keryvian 's blade glowed with a blue fire when drawn, which was bright enough to read by, and the hilt bore the likeness of a blue dragon with teeth clutching the blade.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Keryvian was imbued with properties that made its blade magically keen , allowed the wielder to jump and fall gently over large distances, and allowed the wielder to set a magical proximity alarm. The sword could also reflect back magic cast at it or its wielder.</p>
<p>The sword could be commanded to "guard" and would wait until anyone who was not the owner touched it, at which point it began attacking that individual and making a very loud singing noise.</p>
<p>Only a capable warrior of good heart could take up Keryvian . Like all of the Baneblades of Demron, Keryvian was a powerful magic sword that was imbued with holy energy and that was particularly effective against outsiders , undead , and any evil-aligned creatures, "burning" the life (or unlife) out of them.</p>
<p>But Foebane 's full power was only realized when it was combined with Fflar's scabbard, which was also magical. Without it, the sword was simply a +3 blade and did extra damage against all undead , shapeshifters , and outsiders . Combining the two was not simply done, though, and required special means. With the scabbard, the sword grew stronger, to +5 ; enhanced the wielder's physical and mental resilience; and it drained life as with Larloch's minor drain from those it struck .</p>
<p>The value of the sword as of 1368 DR was estimated at 35,000 gold pieces .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Keryvian was crafted by the archmage Demron before the fall of Myth Drannor , and was considered the greatest of his series of Baneblades. The blade was used by a thief to kill Demron, hence the name "Demron's Bane".</p>
<p>It was once carried by Fflar Starbrow Melruth .</p>
<p>As of 1368 DR , it was in the ruins of Myth Drannor , but in 1369 DR , Foebane or a copy of it could be found on a living statue on the uppermost level of Watcher's Keep . The imp Cespenar could combine it with its scabbard once that too was found.</p>
<p>By 1374 DR it was in the possession of Seiveril Miritar . He kept it at Seamist in northern Evermeet , where it decorated a wall for a time, until Fflar was resurrected and took up the sword once more.</p>
