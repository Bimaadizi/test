<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, Celia joined Abella and Barthold in an investigation in Eveningstar as they pursued the Wheloon escapee Dedryk Black . Magistrate Toth sent a band of adventurers from the world of Eberron to chase the cultists in the foothills of the Storm Horns , which they believed was related to their quarry. When the cultists and their leader Dedryk were captured in their hideout , Magistrate Barthold supervised their transportation to Wheloon for imprisonment, and Celia returned to duty in Wheloon, trying to find out how he managed to escape the prison. While Magistrate Cornelius directly handled the interrogation, the process was interrupted by an attack by the shadar-kai assassin Teralyn , who managed to kill Cornelius and rescue Dedryk.</p>
