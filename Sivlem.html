<p>Sivlem was a powerful enchanted longsword crafted by master smith Nevik of Amn .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Sivlem was initially created to be an intelligent blade that would inspire heroism and valor in its owner. However, Nevik, by accident, imbued sentience into Sivlem's less impressive twin. Despite being silent, the sword possessed an immensely powerful +6 enchantment that dealt devastating damage to its foes and made aiming attacks effortless. Sivlem also enhanced the wielder's physical strength and granted them the ability similar to the effects of the freedom of movement spell . The blade possessed a razor-sharp keen edge and edited a gentle blue glow, illuminating 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) around it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The weapon was forged some years before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , in the Lands of Intrigue by master smith Nevik who intended Sivlem to serve as the pinnacle of his craft – the best sword in Amn. He succeeded in creating a beautiful weapon filled with magic, humming with power. However, when Nevik drew the sword for the first time and ordered it to speak, he realized that he had made a mistake in his enchantments and imbued Sivlem's sibling weapon with intelligence instead. Despite the error, Sivlem still had a long history of wielders through the years, but not as many as its lucky sister sword.</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the weapon fell into he hands of Mother Feodorra , a charm and magic item peddler from the Rashemi city of Mulsantir .</p>
