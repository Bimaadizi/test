<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Gallaway Trading Coster was operated by the Gallaway family and brought to prominence by merchant Ilmus Gallaway of Easthaven . Over the years, the small caravan business grew to become a trading coster. By the early 14 th century DR , Rawleigh Gallaway led the family, inhered from his father, Ilmus. In turn, Rawleigh's daughter Deirdre Gallaway was put in charge of the company's operations in Targos, personally sent there by Ilmus so that the youth could prove herself. This time would become her biggest challenge as the trade was interrupted by attacks of the Legion of the Chimera , and the coster's goods and lumber were confiscated by the Targos Guard to build the palisades and help protect Town. Jemeliah was one of the employees of the coster in Targos who was assigned the advisory job to Deirdre by her father as "one last favor" after serving the family's business for half of his life. Jemeliah did not approve of the town of Targos' actions and thought that the massive debt they racked up with Deirdre would never be paid off. Deirdre had a reputation of being a brash flame-headed whelp, and she received little respect from Lord Ulbrec Dinnesmore 's men.</p>
