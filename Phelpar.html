<h2>History</h2>
<p>Phelpar polymorphed his rival Selvar into a frog for several years. He used this opportunity to steal all of Selvar's spells and magic items and hid them in a secret cache in a tomb in the Rathgaunt Hills in the Shaar . Selvar was somehow able to transform himself back to his natural form and tracked Phelpar down to exact his revenge. He polymorphed Phelpar into a horse and rode him to death, then used his magic to speak with his corpse and learn the location of his magical cache so he could reclaim his stolen magic.</p>
