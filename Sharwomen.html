<p>The Sharwomen were a thieves guild based in the city of Tsurlagol in the Vast in the 1360s DR .</p>
<h2>Leadership</h2>
<p>The Sharwomen were directly controlled by the Cult of the Shadow , the local temple and worshipers of Shar . Their head was the high priestess of Shar, but her identity was unknown in both roles.</p>
<h2>Base</h2>
<p>The Sharwomen's headquarters were in the temple itself, such that the temple doubled as a thieves' guild.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>As their name suggested, the Sharwomen were originally only open to female members. Tsurlagol once had two thieves' guilds, divided by gender. However, when the separate men-only thieves' guild was wiped out years before, the Sharwomen began accepting male members into their ranks.</p>
<p>Although open to both genders by 1367 DR , the guild remained unequal. Male thieves held lesser positions and did most of the work, while the original female thieves dominated in high-ranking positions, and received much of the gold and credit. There were still relatively few male members by 1370 DR .</p>
