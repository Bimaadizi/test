<p>Liontongue was a hamlet founded by Nerren Prentiyuel during his tenure as the Magister , in 667 DR . It was depopulated in 669 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nerren Prentiyuel founded Liontongue because he hated traveling but still intended to discharge the duties of the Magister ; it was a hamlet of his students when he first created it. It eventually became a village; however, after his death in 669 DR , his students became emboldened by the spells they had learned and slew each other in spell duels; the survivors split between those who fled and those who were slain by brigands. Little but founding stones remained thirty years later, in 699 DR .</p>
