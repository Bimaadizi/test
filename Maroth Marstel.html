<p>Leader of the Marstel trading house, Maroth was the Harmach of Hulburg in 1479 DR. The shadowmage Rhovann dominated Maroth's will and turned him into his puppet. When Maroth's mind became too enfeebled for him to function as the Harmach, Rhovann killed Maroth and replaced him with a construct.</p>
