<p>The Ancient Ones were believed to be supernatural beings of great power by the Nexalans , but they were actually drow .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Ancients lived in the Highcave at the summit of Zaltec 's sacred volcano, Mount Zatal . Like many drow, they could not stand direct sunlight and thus only operated in darkness. They were capable of practicing powerful Hishna magic. Their duties included feeding Zaltec's Darkfyre and advising the high priest of Nexal .</p>
<p>Lolth turned the Ancient Ones into driders during the Night of Wailing as punishment for their lack of faith in her.</p>
