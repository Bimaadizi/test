<p>Castles was a strategy game, distinct from the game chess that sometimes was referred to by the same name. Castles was played in the southern land of Halruaa by jordainis and ruling class wizards alike.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The game board of castles consisted of a collection of tiny carved buildings and pieces that represented troops. Similar to chess, the goal of castles was to encircle the opponent's base buildings, forcing them to surrender.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , a young jordaini named Matteo was tasked with teaching strategy to petulant young daughter of Procopio Septus, the Lord Mayor of Halarahh â€“ Penelope Septus . The girl showed little interest and accused the jordaini of cheating when she swiftly lost the game. Lord Mayor Procopio loved strategy games such as chess, castles, various card games, and magically enchanted and immaculately-crafted miniature wargames depicting the Nath and the historic battle of the Mycontil's Stand . Procopio Septus used them to prepare himself for the much-desired future as the next Netyarch of Halruaa.</p>
