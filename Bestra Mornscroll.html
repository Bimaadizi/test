<p>Bestra Mornscroll was a female Chondathan human cleric of Shar in the early 1370s DR . She was involved in the plot to kidnap petitioners from the false Temple of Mystra in Wheloon for sacrifice in the black dragon Despayr 's scheme to tear a hole in the Weave of magic and so form a dead-magic zone over all the Vast Swamp .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Bestra Mornscroll was operating at the Lost Refuge in the Vast Swamp , directing the duped petitioners from the false Temple of Mystra in Wheloon through the Dusk Lord's Passage portal to their dooms.</p>
<p>Once, on the other side of the Dusk Lord's Passage, in the Shadow Citadel , an acolyte was slain by the shadow elemental guardians of the Dusk Lord's throne . Bestra ordered that it be left alone until she had time to destroy the guardians. She would not get the chance.</p>
<p>In early Eleint , adventurers in service to Mystra investigating the Sharrans' activities assaulted the Lost Refuge. Bestra was presumably slain in the fighting, but would attempt to escape under cover of a blacklight spell .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Overseen by Ketsarra Shadowscale , Bestra was the highest-ranking (albeit only) priest at the Lost Refuge. She was in charge of the defense of the courtyard. Her primary duty, however, was to pose as a priestess of Mystra and greet and oversee the duped petitioners and finally send them through the Dusk Lord's Passage into the Plane of Shadow and eventually the Monastery of the Ebon Dome . She communicated with Lady Naedaenya Arthas of the false temple, supplying her with reinforcements and supplies as needed. She also commanded the ghirrash Jherremor in the Shadow Citadel, but he was a reluctant minion.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A cleric of Shar, Bestra commanded the Darkness and Knowledge domains . She had been initiated into the higher secrets of the church of Shar and wielded Shadow Weave magic .</p>
<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>She once had cause to learn the Giant language .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Bestra fought in full plate armor with light steel shield and heavy mace , all of masterwork quality. Over this, she wore a cloak of resistance +1 and was equipped with a wand of cure light wounds and a scroll of divine power . She used a disc of secrets for her unholy symbol of Shar.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When the adventurers assaulted the Lost Refuge, Bestra was only seen in full plate armor and face-covering helm, so her appearance is unknown.</p>
