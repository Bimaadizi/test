<p>Ren was a male human soldier of the Zhentilar Company of the Scorpions during the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR and the personal assassin of Commander Tyzack .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ren was a member of the Company of Scorpions and also Tyzack's personal assassin. His duty as assassin was usually to silence all members of the Company that discovered the captain's secret: in his youth, Tyzack has tried to rebel against the Zhentarim .</p>
<p>All changed when, during the Time of Troubles, the Company of the Scorpions met the mortal Cyric . Soon, Cyric become the second-in-command of the company. All the previous bearers of the title had been killed by Ren for discovering the captain's secret. In the end, during a rain of metal blades—a manifestation of the crazy magic of that time—Tyzack died, probably killed by Ren, who considered Cyric a better commander. Ren later explained Tyzack's secret to Cyric, and the two mocked the dead captain for his stupidity.</p>
