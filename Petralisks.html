<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>1,500 dao cavalry using greater basilisks for mounts made up the Petralisks.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>

<p>They were slow to react and maneuver against enemies made from earth and stone.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Sevenfold Mazework within the Great Dismal Delve served as base of all dao military organizations.</p>
