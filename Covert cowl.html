<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Covert cowl's enchantment allowed the wearer to land especially devastating attacks much easier while obscured by shadow or darkness. It also made the wearer more dextrous and boosted their reaction time.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was believed that covert cowls were once worn by Deep Duerra's own rebellious children, using their magic to keep themselves safe from the dangers of the duergar society, until Duerra confronted her children with great rage. One of these cowls could be found in the cellar of the Last Light Inn , a century after the town of Reithwin was consumed by the Shadow-cursed Lands . The cowl was still in the accursed ruin as of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR .</p>
