<p>Yinazzil was a small town found along the coast within the Cities of the Ancients region of east Zakhara in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Yinazzil was found approximately 110 mi (180 km) southwest of Rog'osto along the coast of Bahr al-Ajami . It lay at the edge of the jungle but was not close to any of the mighty rivers of the Ruined Kingdoms, making the purpose of its location somewhat puzzling.</p>
