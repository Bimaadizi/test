<p>Hespheira was a small village located at the base of Mount Sar in the Sword Coast North that disappeared from the face of Toril for over a hundred years in the 11 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lathander's Light, 1024 DR , the entire settlement shifted from the Prime Material plane to the Plane of Shadow by unknown magical means.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the people of Hespheira, many of them were rescued by the Brotherhood of Light , led by the daring Dahaerlin of the Burning Brand . The paladin and his allies fought against the dracolich Umbralax and securing the lives of the villages at the cost of their own.</p>
<p>The ruins of the village returned to Faerûn in the Year of the Shadowkin Return, 1136 DR . Unfortunately it was accompanied by Umbralax itself and shadow creatures that resembled undead wraiths . The Knights of the Aster met the threat of the dracolich and its minions, in a conflict that came to be known as the Battle of Hespheira, emerging victorious thanks in part to the rod of Lathander .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>It was believed that the portal between the Prime and the Plane of Shadow near the ruined village remained for some time, at least until the late 14 th century DR .</p>
