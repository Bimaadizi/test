<p>The Clenched Fist was a fist-shaped enchanted mace created sometime before 1312 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The heavy mace was a rusty iron scepter created in the form of a hand curled into a fist.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Clenched Fist possessed a simple +1 enchantment. However, the main curios magic of the Fist was its ability to generate a single gold coin per day. When the wielder of the weapon held it in their left hand and put their right palm underneath the Fist , the iron hand opened up and propped a gold piece into the wielder's palm. This ability was referred to as the gold blessing.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Clenched Fist's origins were a mystery. Some believed that the mace was a scepter and the symbol of office in some old kingdom; however, which court or church it might've once belonged to was unknown. It was very likely, that the Clenched Fist was many hundreds of years old by the 14 th century DR . By the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , Clenched Fist found its way into a small logging village of Shaengarne Ford in Icewind Dale , where it could be found in the town's watermill.</p>
