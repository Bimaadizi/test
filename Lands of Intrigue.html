<p>The Lands of Intrigue was a collective term used to describe the nations of Amn , Calimshan , Muranndin , Erlkazar , Velen and Tethyr .</p>
<p>An older term for the same territory was the Empires of the Sands , though that term was a misnomer, as out of all the nations that made up the region only Calimshan had any deserts to speak of.</p>
