<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Icewind Dale was battered by natural and supernatural disasters caused by an awakening demigod in the Reghed Glacier . The town of Termalaine was evacuated after it was buried under the snow of a magical and deadly snowstorm. Seizing this opportunity, Grimbold Tornhelm led his gang of Underdark riffraff to plunder the town's famous tourmaline gem mines, hoping to grab enough wealth to retire from the mercenary life in his old age. However, the mines were occupied by Marcos Flass , a Red Wizard of Thay building gem golems using the mine's supply. Marcos wanted the marauders gone or killed. He may have had the famed Hero of Neverwinter confront Grimbold Tornhelm and remove the duergar's head in exchange for lending his tourmaline golems to the defense of Targos in a looming battle. It was unknown whether the Hero allied themselves with the Red Wizard and ended Grimbold's life.</p>
