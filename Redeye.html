<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The megatribe under Redeye's rule constantly feuded over leadership and land with other smaller lizardmen communities of the Lizard Marsh.</p>
<p>Redeye and his kin bore no ill will with the nearby Blue Feather clan, but was willing to aid humans wronged by the Blue Feathers in order to avoid open conflict with Daggerford. Eventually, the tensions between two tribes lead to open conflicts.</p>
<p>Lizardfolk of the Lizard Marsh, including Redeye's tribe were quite advanced among other lizardmen communities. They used metal armor and weapons, domesticated various dinosaurs , and traded goods and slaves with various intelligent aquatic races of the Sea of Swords .</p>
<p>Amiskal 's great tribe had little contact with Redeye's lizardfolk but traded them razortalon eggs for raising and training, to little successes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before or in early 14 th century DR , a group of heroes ventured into the Lizard Marsh and allegedly slew Redeye. However by 1357 DR , Redeye was back and considered to be an ancient witch doctor and leader who strives to unite the lizardfolk tribes of the marsh under his leadership. Around that time, Redeye attempted several times to trade rare swamp bird feathers and local delicacies for metal weapons with the neighboring city of Daggerford . The trade offer was shut down by the city's Council of Guilds as Redeye was considered an old foe. It was estimated that about half of the lizardfolk of the marsh were following Redeye during that period.</p>
<p>In 1357 DR, a group of adventurers from Daggerford ventured into the Lizard Marsh following a lizardfolk raid on Cromm's Hold . Redeye's scouts spotted the possible invaders and the old witch doctor assembled a squad to contact the visitors. The hero knew that Redeye's tribe vas not responsible for the raid as the attackers wore blue colors. However, it was unknown if the adventurers entered conflict with Redeye and his agents or befriended the creature. Redeye was known to peacefully negotiate with travelers who were not aggressive towards his tribe. Occasionally, he offered rewards to adventurers for minor tasks such as exterminating a flock of pteranodons or hunting down medicinal herbs to help stave off an epidemic of swamp fever .</p>
<p>By 1370 DR , it was widely believed that Redeye who led the lizard tribes of the marsh was a lich who returned after being slain by adventurers decades earlier. The strange undead lizardman attracted the attention of various arcane organizations, both good and evil who wanted to discover the ruth behind Redeye's transformation. Around the same time Redeye and his impressive lizardfolk force threatened the city of Daggerford, demanding a payment of 10,000 gold pieces from Duke Daggerford annually or face war. Pwyll "Greatshout" Daggerford hired three bands of adventurers to confront the lizardman lich.</p>
<p>In 1372 DR , Redeye came to conflict with yet another lizardfolk tribe in the Lizard Marsh. Chieftain Saslick was the lich's next target after splintering from Redeye's megatribe. However, the rival tribe was under the protection of an ancient black dragon Thuraskulusk whom they worshiped as a deity. Redeye hatched a clever plan. He stole one of the black dragon's eggs and offered a trade to a wandering Hero of Daggerford who was investigating suspicious activities surrounding the "death" of Pwyll Greatshout. The lizardman offered the Hero several magic items fished out of the swamps and information on a swelling hellish tanarukka forces menacing Daggerford. In exchange, the Hero was to sneak into Saslick's hut and hide the egg there, framing the dragon's ally for the theft. Subsequently, the Hero was successful with the aid of the Green Hag of Lizard Marsh and her polymorph sorcery. Furious Thuraskulusk tracked the eggs back to Saslick's hut, killing the chieftain where he stood. With the dragon's protection gone, Redeye reclaimed the tribe.</p>
