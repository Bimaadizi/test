<p>A wand of pyrotechnics was a common magical wand that created a burst of multicolored light.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>With this wand, the caster was able to create a burst of multicolored light up to 60 feet (18 meters) from the caster. A sparkling noise was also created alongside the light, which could be heard as far as 300 feet (91 meters) away. The light was as bright as a flame but of very short duration, only lasting a second. The wand carried seven charges; when the last charge was used, the wand exploded into harmless bright sparks.</p>
