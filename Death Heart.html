<p>Death Heart , formerly known as the Heart of the Void , was a city located within one of the major doldrums of the Negative Energy plane . Considered a nexus of evil and undeath , it was largely unexplored by outsiders, with even the Doomguard and Dustmen fearing it. It was also considered to be one of the most stable locations within that plane .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This city had many tall spired structures, plazas, squares, streets, and fountains. It stood within a metal sphere that was 1 mile (1,600 meters) in diameter, protecting the city from the baneful negative energy of the plane it floated in.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Death heart originated from a long dead, alternate Prime Material plane as an experimental utopian community free of other schools of thought. At some point it drifted into the Negative Energy plane, though some believe that it was an attempt to establish a colony within that plane. When it entered the Negative Energy plane the city was overrun by undead , who proceeded to feast upon the flesh and souls of its inhabitants.</p>
<p>Over time various evil factions developed among the city's undead and they engaged in a near endless war with one other.</p>
<p>At some point it became connected to Faerûn by means of a portal placed within a tunnel complex in the mountains of Thay by the necromancer Zzarka Tuzarr . She would occasionally participate in the warfare among the factions for the sole purpose of amusement.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Death Heart was entirely inhabited by a wide variety of undead creatures. Most notably, several liches and powerful vampires claimed this place as their home.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>

<p>Rumors propagated by the mercane claimed that a vampiric minotaur brokered a peace among the various factions in Death Heart, encouraging further research into the nature of both the city and the Negative Energy plane.</p>
<p>The mercane who propagated these rumors speculated that the vampiric minotaur sought to one day steer the city into another plane and wreak havoc with the city's undead.</p>
