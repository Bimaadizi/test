<p>Kalas Winters was the innkeeper and owner of the Wolf's Pelt Inn in the Icewind Dale community of Targos in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kalas Winters was a 39-year-old man, very tall (6 feet and 3 inches (1.9 meters)), and muscular (215 pounds (97.5 kilograms)). He had reddish-brown hair, brown eyes like the rest of his family, and a thick beard. He usually dressed in dark green and brown clothes that showed signs of age.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Kalas was a friendly and polite man. He gladly shared tales of his adventures with anyone who listened.</p>
<p>Even though his inn had a few candles inside, Kalas frowned on their use, in fear of fire.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Kalas Winters took care of his family well. He kept a close eye on his spritely and willful daughter Dorthy to keep her out of trouble.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Kalas wore his simple thin gold band +2 ring of protection on the left hand's index finger. He had a magical +2 dagger tucked in his waist, and he also kept his magical +1 long sword close by behind the bar in case of trouble.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around Tarsakh , 1369 DR , Kalas, a retired adventure of some renown, lived with his family in the Ten Towns and ran his inn. Wolf's Pelt Inn, the inn Kalas purchased with the saved up adventuring coin , was busy with fishermen, dockworkers, and adventurers, and it was well-managed, clean, and welcoming.</p>
<p>Kalas had a standing agreement with a trader and caravaneer named Boswell Peddywinkle to house the guards and adventurers hired by him.</p>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Kalas and Beartrid still ran Wolf's Pelt Inn. They were elated to see the famed Hero of Neverwinter visit their establishment but could not offer them lodgings due to a refugee crisis in the Ten Towns at the time.</p>
