<p>Yegg was an irascible goblin chef who cooked for the goblinoids of the Cragmaw Castle around 1491 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The corpulent goblin chief cook was said to be cantankerous, and often bullied the other goblins that worked for him. He was far more sturdy in combat than the average goblin, being able to take almost double the amount of blows before falling.</p>
<p>He did not keep his kitchen or dining room in good condition. Several moldy pieces of food, unwashed dishes, and leftovers lined the tables.</p>
