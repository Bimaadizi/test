<p>Incarnum was a form of raw magic , the ever-present magical energy that permeated all life and existence.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Incarnum manifested as wisps of pure magical energy.</p>
<h2>Properties</h2>

<p>In addition to standing within divine presence, incarnates could manifest their powers after being exposed to wild magic or powerful spells or magical phenomena.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The amount of accessible incarnum increased throughout the Realms drastically following the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , and the Time of Troubles. As the deities of Toril walked upon the world as mortals, they attracted many mortal followers who absorbed the incarnum that manifested in their wake.

<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
