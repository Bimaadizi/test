<p>Morgur's Mound was the ancestor mound of the Thunderbeast tribe of the Uthgardt . It was located within the Crags , and was named for the brother of Uthgar .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The mound was roughly shaped like a creature known as a " thunderbeast " to the Uthgardt, described by some as a wingless dragon with a long neck. Prior to the late 15 th century DR , the totem of the Thunderbeast tribe—a skeleton of a long-dead thunderbeast—sat atop the mound, and the wizard Amelior Amanitas speculated that this skeleton was likely that of a brontosaurus . In the late 15 th century DR, this skeleton had disappeared, and was replaced by a row of massive bones protruding along the mound's back from the head to the tail.</p>
<p>Enormous cairns encircled the mound out to a quarter mile 0.25 mi (400 m), housing the bones of revered warriors of the Thunderbeast tribe.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Throughout the Mound's history, superstitious members of the tribe often buried magic items within it, believing they would be watched over by the spirits of the dead.</p>
<p>When the Thunderbeasts visited the mound for Runemeet in the late 15 th century DR, they found that the mound had been dug up, and both the thunderbeast skeleton and the treasures within had been stolen. This theft was committed by the Red Wizards of Thay , who took the bones back to their nearby Dread Ring and animated them.</p>
<p>The tribe stopped visiting the mound in the following years, which left it open to robbers and looters who claimed most of the hidden magical items buried there.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Morgur's Mound was believed to be the burial site of Morgur , Uthgar's mortal brother.</p>
<p>Rumors claimed that Thunderbeast shamans could animate the skeleton atop the mound whenever their tribe was in dire need of protection. Even after its disappearance, as many as four smaller dinosaur skeletons were said to lie in wait within the mound to defend its buried treasures.</p>
