<p>Jagress Dawnlion was a human Lathanderite priest that lived and died in southern Unther sometime before the Spellplague devastated the region.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jagress was buried wearing white robes , in a stone sarcophagus with their name etched into the lid, within the mausoleum of a burial site. Their sarcophagus was designed with a false bottom to hide their belongings within it, which included a number of gold pieces , a +1 amulet of mental resolution , and a +1 symbol of turning .</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , when the surrounding area was part of what was known as Tymanther , the mausoleum where Jagress rested was desecrated by a human necromancer and later a member of the Gem Assayers Union named Melnar . The former took Jagress's skull and enchanted it with Skull Watch to watch over the mausoleum. Later, a group of adventurers sent by Dirnth of the Gem Assayers Union to find Melnar would inspect Jagress's sarcophagus, finding their body had long since been destroyed but discovering the hidden compartment.</p>
