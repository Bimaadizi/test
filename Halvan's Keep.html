<p>Halvan's Keep was a keep in Harrowdale , once occupied by Halvan the Dark , the original lord of Harrowdale (then called Halvan's Dale).</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was described as an old, rambling manor house enclosed by newer walls, and the origin of the manor house is therefore not known.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the fall of Halvan the Dark, the Council of Seven Burghers came to power, and instigated a 50 gp per head fine on anyone found entering or leaving the keep, in an attempt to keep vandalism and looting under control.</p>
<p>Around 1338 DR , adventurers entered the old keep and unleashed a guardian creature that began a fight, and an ensuing fire. The fire blackened the keep and left it without a roof, as well as uncovering rooms that previously lay secret, as well as entry to the dungeons, which were found to be occupied by wraiths , believed to be undead incarnations of those locked in the dungeons when the keep was occupied.</p>
<p>The keep was utilized by a number of organizations since its demise as Halvan's main residence, including followers of Loviatar and a cabal of smugglers. An attempt to access the keep was made around 1368 DR by the Company of the Werebat , but seven of its eleven members died there.</p>
<p>Accounts of the monsters present at the keep around 1368 DR included beholders , deepspawn , displacer beasts , feyrs , giant centipedes , kobolds , mimics , minotaurs , mongrelmen , and trolls , as well as the aforementioned wraiths.</p>
