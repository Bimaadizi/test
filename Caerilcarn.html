<p>The Caerilcarn (meaning the Council of the Wood ) was a loose association of elf leaders in the High Forest that sought to rebuild the lost empire of Eaerlann .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>It was led by a wood elf named Morgwais .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>While it never claimed to represent the beliefs of all elves in the High Forest and the Silver Marches , its end goal was to revive the lost elven realm of Eaerlann. In practice, it provided a forum for elven leaders in the High Forest to discuss issues of mutual concern and pass along news. It worked to revive Eaerlanni settlements and protect those that still existed.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was formed sometime before 1374 DR .</p>
<p>When orcs and daemonfey began to invade in 1374 DR , it was instrumental in evacuating wood elf villages in the path of the invaders, leading them to the Lost Peaks . There, with assistance from the Argent Legion , they were able to repel the attacks. At this point, the army of Evermeet began to occupy Myth Glaurach , putting them that much closer to their dream of a revived Eaerlann.</p>
