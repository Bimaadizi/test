<p>Dihl al-Taif , or the Ghost's Route , was a trade route located in Zakhara in 1367 DR .</p>
<p>The portion of Dihl al-Taif found within mighty Huzuz was called the Caravan Boulevard .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Caravans travelling by Dihl al-Taif followed Al-Sarif River east from Huzuz for 90 mi (140 km) before heading north into the Haunted Lands . Another 100 mi (160 km) of travel through harsh desert brought them to the small village of Zarif . Zarif was the last chance to re-supply for hundreds of miles.</p>
<p>After departing Zarif, several days of travel brought the caravan to the Oasis of Solitude . This oasis marked the last source of fresh water before reaching Al-Malih River . A 200 mi (320 km) stretch of barren wasteland greeted the caravan before the land finally began to turn green again where it met Al-Malih River, which flowed northeast directly toward Halwa for another 150 mi (240 km).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Though rife with danger, this heavily trafficked trade route was the quickest way to transport goods between Halwa and Huzuz.</p>
