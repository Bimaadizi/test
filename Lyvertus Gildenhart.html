<p>Lyvertus Gildenhart was an elven adventuring warrior who followed the philosophy of a sword in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Unlike many of his peers, Lyvertus Gildenhart did not pursue more scholarly professions; instead, becoming a fighter. Lyvertus wholeheartedly believed that it was the sword that advanced civilization rather than books and scribes. The same philosophy also guided the elf's desire to accumulate wealth. By the age of 118 years old, Lyvertus had already accumulated affluence and managed to lose it all. He financed the construction of a manor in the jungles of Chult but neglected to investigate the local dangers. The manor, the wealth, and the servants were devoured by a hive of ignominious foes â€“ fire ants . Despite the loss, Lyvertus planned on earning coin to commission the building of another home in a less dangerous area, maybe neighboring a tribe of goblins .</p>
<p>Sometime in the 14 th century DR, Lyvertus Gildenhart was among the adventurers who were interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed sorceress to retrieve the equally queer magical orb from its depths.</p>
