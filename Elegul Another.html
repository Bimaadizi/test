<p>Elegul Another was a cleric of Tymora in Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Elegul was a quintessential priest of Tymora. He liked jokes, partook in dares, and was overall quite a reckless person. While he was kind enough to help others, including healing, it had its limits for he believed over-reliance on him led to a life where chance had not influence for his taste.</p>
<p>Elegul also believed that decisions about how to spend money should be left to his church and not to the individual.</p>
<p>Elegul believed people should not use magic items , because he believed using them was to take out the component of chance and thus turning away from his deity .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Elegul was a Wandering Fortune, an adventuring priest of Tymora. He was adept at combat with either the mace or a morning star . As a cleric , he could also cast spells and he generally asked for bless , cure disease , cure light wounds , dispel magic , favor of Tymora , find traps , flame blade , hold person , and produce flame spells .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Elegul once got his hand on a magic item called Halaster's teleport ring . He used it and lost all of his possessions including the ring but for his holy symbol .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>To prevent others from relying on him, or more precisely on the powers Tymora supplied, instead of facing danger, he kept himself from becoming a long-time part of an adventurer party.</p>
<p>He was considered a quintessential follower of Tymora and the deity viewed it the same way to the point that she was willing to personally help him in danger.</p>
