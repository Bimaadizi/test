<p>Kossuth ( pronounced : / k oʊ ˈ s uː θ / koh-SOOTH ) was the god of elemental fire and purification through fire. The Lord of Flames was not considered a true god in the late 15 th century DR , but an elemental primordial , a being whose power rivaled that of a true deity.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kossuth appeared as a red-hot column of awesome flame more than 60 feet (18 meters) high and 20 feet (6.1 meters) in diameter. His voice could be heard for hundreds of yards in every direction, a hissing whisper mixed with disturbing crackling and popping.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The supremely powerful elemental being known as Kossuth had lorded over fire since the earliest moments of the multiverse, though whether or not the contemporary Kossuth was the same primordial being or one in a long line of similarly named successors is a matter of much conjecture. The Lord of Flames rarely intervened in affairs in the mortal world, spending most of his time embroiled in the intrigues of the Inner Planes .</p>
<p>Kossuth's doctrine of elemental supremacy virtually assured conflict with the other elemental lords. Kossuth was vehemently opposed to Istishia and his clergy. He was watchful of the upstart archomental Imix , who was always trying to undermine his better but while Kossuth remained clearly the true master of the element of fire, the Grand Sultan of the Efreet was the only being on the plane who held even a slightly comparable level of power. The Firelord interacted very little with the other deities of Faerûn . Moradin and Flandal Steelskin honored him for the heat of the forge, but he barely responded. The return of Bane pleased Kossuth, however; the two deities seemed to agree on the importance of a strong religious hierarchy and had a common intolerance for the ephemeral and unpredictable nature of chaos.</p>
<h2>Divine Realm</h2>
<p>Kossuth dwelled in the Crimson Pillar, a 10‑mile-wide (16‑kilometer) globe made of the primordial power of fire that floated over the Sea of Fire on the Elemental Plane of Fire . It was said that the blue-white flames of the Pillar gave off a heat that made the rest of the plane seem chilly in comparison.</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>The church of Kossuth was rather hierarchical and mostly impersonal. The Church's aims tended to revolve around the acquisition of land, power, and wealth. The followers and clerics were often lawful, without regard for good or evil .</p>
<p>Many Red wizards of Thay worshiped Kossuth and the Flaming Brazier of Eltabbar was supposedly the largest temple of Kossuth in all the Realms.</p>
<p>After death, bodies of worshipers were cremated.</p>
<h3>Orders</h3>
<p>Kossuth's monks could learn to become clerics of the Firelord without sacrificing their potential as monks.</p>
<h3>Worship in Zakhara</h3>
<p>On the continent of Zakhara , Kossuth was called one of the " cold gods of the elements ". They were "cold" because those were seen as uncaring for human affairs and opposed to the Land of Fate's pervasive culture of Enlightenment . Only a few Zakharans were willing to worship a cold god in order to gain power.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early History</h3>
<p>In the Year of Recompense, −150 DR , powerful Raumatharan wizards managed to summon Kossuth from his elemental home and instructed him to destroy a besieging army of hated Narfell . This he did, but he soon turned against the wizards, incinerating their city for their arrogance. The resulting conflagration consumed much of the northern coast of the Alamber Sea , and the fires of Kossuth's anger burned strong for more than a decade after his withdrawal from Toril.</p>
<p>Kossuth appeared in the Realms once again in the Year of the Star Rose, 801 DR , to assist some of his faithful with the destruction of a colossal octopus .</p>
<h3>Modern History</h3>
<p>Kossuth was credited by his faithful with limiting the disastrous Salamander War of the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR in Thay . Without his influence, they say, the War would have turned into an even greater debacle.</p>
<p>Kossuth was not among the deities sighted in Faerûn during the exile of the gods by Ao during the Time of Troubles in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR .</p>
