<h2>History</h2>
<p>Basalin used Albruin some years before the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR . He used the enchanted blade to protect his village from a variety of giant spiders , some of which were truly fantastical animals. These creatures menaced Basalin's home, controlled by the Red Wizards of Thay whose true motivations remained unrevealed. Albruin protected Basalin from spiders' venom and allowed him to detect and slay Red Wizards who wore dweomers of invisibility .</p>
