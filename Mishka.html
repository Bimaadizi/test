<p>Mishka was a poor child who was taken captive by the evil hag Skabatha Nightshade .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>She acted as Granny Nightshade's personal servant and scullery maid. Because of her repeated escape attempts, Mishka was eventually chained to a worktable in the hag's lair.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>While in Skabatha's custody, Mishka was well-protected by the goblin Chucklehead . While he cared for the poor child, he was too fearful of the hag to help her escape.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>While busy at work for Granny Nightshade, Misha encountered two travelers that broke into her lair: the thief Billi Sharpe and planes-traveling harengon Clipper . Mishka helped Billi find her long-lost brother Desmond , who had been kidnapped by the hag nearly a decade prior. When Granny Nightshade herself appeared and menaced the group, Mishka confronted her captor. She stood defiant against Granny Nightshade and called her out on her lies.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the adventurers were not able to free Mishka from her bondage, though they promised to return for her and the other missing children held by the hag.</p>
