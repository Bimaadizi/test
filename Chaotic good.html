<p>Chaotic good characters combined a good heart with a free spirit. These characters acted as their own conscience directed with little regard for the expectations of others. They were often kind, benevolent, and strong individualists who were hostile to the claims of rules, regulations and social order.</p>
<p>Characters of chaotic good alignment hated when people tried to intimidate others into following orders. They would actively work to bring down unjust rulers and organizations, while liberating any oppressed people they came across. They often lived nomadic or solitary lives, finding the laws and regulations of many societies distasteful.</p>
<p>Noble rebel leaders who fought against corrupt regimes, vigilantes who acted for what they saw as the greater good, mercenaries who worked for benevolent causes and anyone who "robbed from the rich and gave to the poor" were all examples of chaotic good characters.</p>
<p>Chaotic good characters were individualist, who took actions of kindness and altruism. Those of lawful evil alignment abused laws to better serve their own interests and thirst for power. These alignments were opposed to one another.</p>
