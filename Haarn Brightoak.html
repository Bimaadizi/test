<h2>History</h2>
<p>Haarn's mother was a warrior – a human Harper agent, and father – an elven senior member of the Emerald Circle. Haarn Brightoak followed in his father's footsteps after his mother stopped visiting them in the forest.</p>
<p>Tracking the signs of a healthy young female wolf that died by unnatural means led Haarn to the mercenary group that was trespassing and hunting in the lands that he'd sworn to protect. It didn't take much eavesdropping for Haarn to discover that the five hunters were responsible for the slaughter of the wolf and many others before her and further that they were killing the wolves in exchange for payment for the wolves' scalps. Despite Haarn's limited exposure to women and his fascination with the sole female hunter in the group, he did not exclude her from his promise to kill each of the hunters should they not leave the forest and stop hunting wolves.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Haarn Brightoak and members of the Emerald Enclave clashed with a reanimated mohrg warlord Borran Klosk , who raised an army of drowned ones around the Whamite Isles to attack the capital of Turmish – Alaghôn .</p>
