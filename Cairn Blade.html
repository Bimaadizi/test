<h2>History</h2>
<p>Cairn Blade was the sword of the mercenary leader Adal Kerrn, named in equal parts as a pun on its owner's name and for its ability to lay enemies low. Adal gained his skills as a heavy infantryman and later assembled a group of mercenaries under his wing. Adal Kerrn often sold his services to warlords, bandits, wizards , and various churches. Cairn Blade was in Adal's possession until his death in 1054 DR when he was crushed by a horse he accidentally slew when fighting a heavily armored opponent. The same battle wiped out the rest of Kerrn's Breakers. Even though Adal Kerrn's body was never recovered, Cairn Blade was found and appropriated by the Church of Helm .</p>
<p>By 1281 DR , Cairn Blade ended up in the hands of an orog commander named Krilag who occupied Dorn's Deep . With his death, Cairn Blade changed hands once again, potentially picked up by the heroes of Kuldahar .</p>
