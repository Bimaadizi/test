<p>The Inficedraco was a genus of prehistoric proto-dragons .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Scholars from Candlekeep believed that inficedracos were an evolved and more intelligent species of the ignidraco genus. It was theorized that inficedraco had ferocious personalities and acted like solitary predators. Inficedracos continued to undergo a series of rapid evolution process until they eventually evolved into the true chromatic dragons species some time around −10,000 DR .</p>
<p>Supporters of the proto-dragon theory believed that chromatic dragons mentioned in historical documents written before that period of time, such as the Parwiccan Cycle and other similar documents, were in fact members of the inficedraco species. Due to the lack of evidence to prove such claims, however, that theory wasn't only not popular enough among scholarly circles and reputed sage s, but also often ridiculed, as well as their supporters.</p>
