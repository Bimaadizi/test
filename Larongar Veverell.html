<p>Larongar Veverell was the Magister from 694 DR to 699 DR .</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>He was handsome.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was rebellious and haughty, almost stereotypically so for an elf.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Besides numerous potions and a few daggers with minor magic, Larongar had crafted three magical staves, and later crafted ribbons that bore nondetection spells to better conceal them.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He had a natural aptitude for fiddling with spells and for enchanting items. His nickname came from his affinity for a spell that created a pair of man-sized hands, blazing with flames, that attacked his foes without direction on his part.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally, Veverell's surname was different; however, he changed it at some point. He was cast out of his family due to his rebelliousness, and became an adventurer; eventually, he settled down for a series of careers as a magical tutor, after making a number of enemies. He had created many potions and daggers with minor magic, but his most important creation were three staves.</p>
<p>Larongar began to take steps to conceal his creations after adventuring bands, which he assumed were sent by his family, began to raid the rooms he rented despite him moving several times. He was eventually slain while sleeping in a ruin, by a beholder mage named Quaervaxthanus , who lurked above the chamber where he settled down to sleep.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Larongar was said to have acquired much of his learning on magic by betraying his human teachers and taking possession of their magic.</p>
