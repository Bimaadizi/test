<p>A fang scarab was a medallion that gave any spider that wore it the ability to hear the dark whispers of Lolth and guide it in battle. However, any non-spider who wore the medallion found it would fuse to their neck and slowly transform them into a half-spider creature.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Made of crystal and shaped like a fang, a fang scarab typically hung from a finely crafted silver chain. The chain was designed to fit over a spider 's head and body.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>They were crafted almost exclusively by worshipers of Lolth for their spider servants. However, occasionally a fang scarab fell into the hands of overly curious rogues or bards .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The fang scarab granted its wearer access to the insidious whispers of Lolth , which would help to guide it in the midst of battle. However, as this item was primarily designed for spiders , it would only function for non-spiders if they could somehow unlock its secrets and fuse the scarab to their neck.</p>
<p>Though the whispers of Lolth could still aid non-spiders, the process of fusing the scarab to their neck exacted a horrific price as they were transformed into a deformed spider-like creature. Those non-spiders who took up the path of a fang of lolth could gain even greater powers through the whispers of Lolth, though only by further changes to their body.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Silence of Lolth in 1372 DR , the whispers that emanated from fang scarabs ceased. The quietening of Lolth 's whispers rendered many of the powers of the fang scarabs and the fangs of Lolth inert.</p>
