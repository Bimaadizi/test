<h2>History</h2>
<p>Eseldra was a vampire and a follower of Szass Tam that was appointed tharchion of Lapendrar circa 1387 DR and remained in that position until the Tyranny of Dragons a century later.
She remembered well the War of the Zulkirs and to avoid a return to that time wanted to eradicate all exiled Red Wizards .
A band of adventurers who were working against the Cult of the Dragon convinced her to gather together all the other factions to thwart Rath Modar 's faction because he planned to ally with Tiamat and conquer Thay .</p>
