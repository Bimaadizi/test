<p>An avenging hammer was a magical warhammer that only the physically strongest could wield.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>In battle, the avenging hammer was functionally equivalent to a lucern hammer +2 . Upon striking an opponent wearing metal armor (such as chainmail or plate mail ), there was a slight chance that the hammer would destroy the armor, shattering it into pieces and rendering it completely useless.</p>
