<p>The Root of the Problem was a magical club that was originally a branch of a tree that was linked to a generous dryad .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This +1 club was particularly harmful to giant humanoids , monstrous creatures and the undead .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This weapon was very old, dating back centuries before Dale Reckoning when the ancient empire of Netheril collapsed and the great Anauroch desert formed in North Faerûn . As the lush and vibrant lands receded, a lone dryad offered a branch from her tree, creating the root as a gift to the forces that fought on behalf of nature's cause.</p>
<p>In the centuries since, some less-respectful scholars bestowed the weapon's ironic nickname — one not really befitting a weapon formed from a genuine sacrifice that stemmed from feelings of sorrow and hope.</p>
<p>By the 14 th century DR, the Root of the Problem had come into the possession of a spirit that dwelt within a druid grove in Amn .</p>
