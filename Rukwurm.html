<p>Rukwurm was a goblin raider member of the Legion of the Chimera in the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , the town of Targos in Icewind Dale became besieged by the Legion of the Chimera. One of the Legion's surprise attacks involved teleporting goblins from underground tunnels into the Targos docks. A group of goblin sappers made it into the basement of one of the warehouses in the docks. Once inside, Rukwurm, who led the assault, used a magic scroll that transported more goblins of the Legion to Targos, along with Ulek the Burrower . Eventually, a group of adventurers from Luskan discovered the collapsed smugglers' tunnels and disposed of both goblin leaders and their troops.</p>
