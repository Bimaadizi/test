<p>The Inn Plain Sight was an inn in the late 15 th century DR . Its proprietor was Alax Jadescales , a dragonborn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Inn Plain Sight was an unassuming roadside establishment attached to a decaying tower. The inn was built not far from the mountain lair of the red dragon Cinderhowl . The inn itself had two floors – a barroom on the first with the kitchens where the proprietor kept a variety of dried chilies and magically preserved unrefrigerated chicken , and a backroom, and guest lodgings on the second.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in the late 15 th century DR, an evil sorcerer called Ervan Soulfallen embarked on a quest to procure a red dragon egg . He magically disguised himself, imprisoned Alax Jadescales, and took on the alias of "Merry Rumwell," the inn's "new owner." Soon after, an adventuring band called the Hard Way passed through the inn, where the sorcerer hired the group to find and retrieve the egg in exchange for coin and hot wings . To no surprise, Ervan Soulfallen paid the adventurers with swift death instead of hot wings and stashed their bodies in the inn's basement. Even though the sorcerer reached his goal, he remained at the inn under the assumed guise, in fear of the dragon's wrath.</p>
<p>Ervan hoped to remain at the Inn Plain Sight until the egg hatched so the hatchling could be indoctrinated into servitude. However, that was not to be. Another group of adventurers – an orc rogue , a gnome fighter, an elf wizard , and a dwarvish cleric arrived and were sure to foil the sorcerer's schemes.</p>
