Traditionally, Writs of the Vizier were handled by the most trusted individuals of the court, such as deputies and assistants. Most of the time, these relationships were quite secretive and the ownership of Writs of the Vizier was kept just as secret.</p>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR , some of these flails could be found in the hands of merchants and individuals along the Sword Coast , the cities of Neverwinter and Fort Locke .</p>
