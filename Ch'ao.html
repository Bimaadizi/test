<p>The ch'ao was the third-lowest unit of currency used in Kara-Tur .</p>
<p>The ch'ao took the form of a paper note, printed in amounts of 1, 10, and 100 ch'ao. One ch'ao was worth 100 fen or 20 yuan , and was equal to 1 tael , while 10 ch'ao were worth 1 ch'ien . If transported to Faerûn circa 1357 DR , where paper money was not used, a ch'ao would be worthless as little more than a curiosity.</p>
<p>Being only paper, ch'ao were easy to carry and use, and were favored for transactions of at least 100 fen.</p>
