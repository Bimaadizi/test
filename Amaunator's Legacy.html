<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This sword was an extremely old shiny brass weapon .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Amaunator's Legacy was a weapon with a powerful +3 enchantment and its magics were deadly to the undead . When the sword was used against the undead, it burned and sizzled them with magical flames. There was also a small chance of the sword unleashing the Beltyn's burning blood spell at any creature it stricken. Additionally, the sword allowed the wielder to cast the sunray spell once per day at the range of 100 feet (30 meters).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Amaunator's Legacy was created more than 3,000 years before Dale Reckoning by Pouldinus to be gifted to his friend, a stern warrior who venerated Amaunator , the Keeper of the Eternal Sun. Kalamnin used the sword to help follow the deity's edicts exactly. Amaunator's Legacy remained in Kalamnin's hand throughout his travels and left only when the warrior was slain in battle against several dozens of nycadaemons . Amaunator's Legacy was claimed by the fiends ' summoner, the Sorcerer named Ylmandi . The summoner's family owned the bastard sword until the fall of Netheril during Karsus's Folly .</p>
<p>The sword reappeared once again in the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR in the hands of a halfling priest of Waukeen of the Golden Lodge in the town of Lonelywood in Icewind Dale .</p>
