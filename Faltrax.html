<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Elturel was transported to Avernus , first layer of the Nine Hells , in the Year of Twelve Warnings, 1494 DR , Faltrax infiltrated the city on a mission to acquire intelligence on its defenses, planning to sell this to whichever fiend paid the highest. It posed as a male human blacksmith named Orin Ragron , with a shop in the city, but was attacked by two bulezaus who'd also found their way in. Faltrax would try to enlist the aid adventurers, but would flee if found out.</p>
