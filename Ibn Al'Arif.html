<p>Ibn Al'Arif , whose name translated to Son of the Great Lore but who was only referred to as the Wandering Son , was a desert guide who lived within the great desert of Anauroch during the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The knowledgeable traveler possessed a legendary level of stubbornness and pride. He was an expert at desert survival, having spent so many years in the deserts of Anauroch.</p>
<p>Ibn saw the outsiders of the desert, called the berrani in Uloushinn , as ignorant and without honor, until they proved themselves otherwise.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Wandering Son was born to the sheikh of the Maurani tribe. He inherited the title at the age of 16, when his father was turned to stone by a basilisk . He led his people for at least a year, but the passionate young leader did not have the experience or wisdom to avoid making a grave mistake. When the tribe vehemently disagreed with an ill-formed decision, they abandoned Ibn and split off into two separate groups, and never again spoke of their former sheikh.</p>
<p>From then on, Ibn wandered, braving the elements of the desert and traveling not only throughout the Sword but exploring the more isolated Plain of Standing Stones and even the High Ice glacier. At some point, he was captured by unknown forces from beneath the Underdark . Rather than giving in to their will, he waited and learned as much as possible about his captors, eventually able to escape from their grasp.</p>
<h2>Bibliography</h2>
<p>Ibn contributed to the compiled works of Elminster's Ecologies with the naturist's guidebook Anauroch , which shared the wisdom and knowledge he had attained after years of travel.</p>
