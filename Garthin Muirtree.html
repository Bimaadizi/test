<p>Garthin Muirtree was a tradelord of Neverwinter in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , who was mysteriously murdered in 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was liked well.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As a tradelord of Neverwinter , he represented its interests in negotiations with other organizations.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was a foe of Dauphran Alskyte and friends with Draevin Flarwood .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Garthin Muirtree was a well-traveled man. He met with Alustriel Silverhand only twice, the first time being years before 1369 DR . He had also met with the mage Janthasarde Ilbright in previous trips to the city.</p>
<p>On that year, he was installed at the Red Griffon Room during his visit to Silverymoon at the request of Auvrarn Labraster , who claimed to fear a "sneaking magic". The tradelord met with a number of people on his final day there, in sequence being Auvrarn himself, Dauphran Alskyte, Draevin Flarwood, and Janthasarde Ilbright . He was to meet with Oscalar Maerbree as well. After all the visits, he was found murdered in that room by the steward Rorild .</p>
<h2>Murder Investigation</h2>
<p>The Red Griffon Room housed a dead magic zone , making it almost certain no magic was used in his killing. However, when Alustriel was checking the dead magic zone for tampering, she realized that some kinds of magic, those that came from and affected the user's own body and nothing else, such as the glow of her own silver fire , would still work. Interrogating Oscalar Maerbree, she learned the meet between Maerbree and Muirtree did not materialize, as Oscalar received a note stating the man had taken ill. Instead, someone else, disguised in Oscalar's likeness was led by them to and from the room; only by checking all of her palace's internal couriers did she learn that Oscalar told the truth about the note. This led her to question all the other men who met with the dead man.</p>
<p>When talking to Auvrarn Labraster, the man suddenly snapped in outrage, asking how he could've savaged the man so thoroughly with nothing but his own pocket knife. However, the man swore up and down he had not killed him and that the Muirtree had been alive last they spoke, and that any honest magical examination would reveal as much. This instantly fingered him as an accomplice, as she'd never told him the man had been savaged thoroughly.</p>
