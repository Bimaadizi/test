<p>The River Rimril was a river in eastern Amn that was a part of the Esmelflow .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The river began somewhere in the Troll Mountains . It poured over Eldath's Mount at the Green Goddess Falls and into Duskwood Dell . From there, it flowed into the Snakewood . Somewhere below the Green Goddess Falls was an underwater portal that connected to the Wyvernstones of Hullack in northeastern Cormyr . Travelers had to be good -aligned, bearing a holy symbol of Eldath , and in the form of a fish to activate the portal .</p>
<p>When it emerged from the Snakewood, it flowed southwest to Eshpurta . There it merged with Trifin Creek and together they joined the Amstel River . Serpent's Tail was a local name for this river because it flowed out of the south end of Snakewood.</p>
<p>A bridge that was part of the South Road crossed the river to reach Eshpurta's southeastern gates.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Shoon Empire , this river flowed through the elvish land of Arundath , the Quiet Forest (as Snakewood was then known). Shoon VII was collecting unicorn horns and slaughtered all the elves who tried to protect them. It was said that the River Rimril flowed red with their blood. For years, fishermen could still find some jewelry and trinkets on their hooks.</p>
