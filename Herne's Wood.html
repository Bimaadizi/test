<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the time of the Bloodforge Wars ( 648 – 657 DR ), Herne's Wood was the site of a bloodforge battle fought between Roxanna , princess of Edenvale , and Bryan the Bold , one of the suitors who sought to win her hand in marriage in the conflict known as Matchmaker Mayhem . At one point, Roxanna camped deep in Herne's Wood to avoid her suitors until she could be crowned queen alone, but her suitors allied and struck together from the ruins.</p>
<p>Some time after, a squatter and bloodforge mage called Sean Mulhaven made his camp close to Herne's Wood, but harassed and insulted everyone who came past. Finally, the leader of the Legendary Campaign arrived and demanded Sean give it up. When Sean only hurled abuses, the leader decided to teach him courtesy, through bloodforge battle.</p>
<p>Although warned to avoid Herne's Wood, the Legendary Campaign leader was forced to camp by its edge. The mage Darah Thorne marshaled bloodforged forces against them, insisting on being given tribute, but the leader chose to fight instead.</p>
<p>At last, an itinerant bard told the leader that a great mage known as Tyranis Shagal , whose achievements were impressive, had laid claim to Herne's Wood. Seeking to win glory by defeating a worthy opponent, the Legendary Campaign leader issued a challenge to Shagal to fight a bloodforge battle.</p>
