<p>Canlespiere was a Netherese city near the Hidden Lake in the heart of Netheril .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The city was built on the west bank of the Southfill River , south of the Hidden Lake and Hidden Forest .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The lands around Canlespiere were especially rich and fertile. Vast farmlands around the city provided the food that fed several enclaves .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally the ogre town of Chanth, Canlespiere came to be in 1004 NY (−2855 DR) . Seeking to claim the fertile farmlands in the region, the arcanist Miren demanded that the ogres depart with threats of force. When they refused, they were slaughtered or driven out, leading to the seven-year Ogres' Stand war as the ogres were slowly expulsed from the region. Over the following centuries, the Netherese slowly developed the region into an agricultural breadbasket.</p>
<p>Canlespiere's most famous inhabitant was the arcanist Noanar , who settled there after wandering in from foreign lands. He practiced and perfected his fire-based spells while living in Canlespiere, and tested them on the local ogre population by joining teams of soldiers as they hunted ogres. This came to an end in 1559 NY (−2300 DR) when the ogres managed to kill him and drag his body away.</p>
<p>In 1804 NY (−2055 DR) , the ogres suddenly returned to the area, this time under the leadership of the ogre mage Storm . Instead of directly attacking the city, Storm had his ogres raid the surrounding farmlands, which proved very effective. Netheril was forced to deploy huge numbers of soldiers to defend the region, but Storm's canny tactics and his magical powers were able to easily overcome them. Two years into his war, two survivors of a battle managed to report back with what they had seen, and the revelation of their magical foe caused arcanists to join the fight against him. This continued until 1810 NY (−2049 DR) , when Storm met the arcanists in a great magical battle on the north bank of the Southfill River. Though it was unclear whether Storm had been killed, his forces dispersed and the ogre mage himself never showed himself again.</p>
<p>With the ogres quelled, Canlespiere enjoyed a long period of prosperity and peace. Their farmlands were bountiful, horses were raised on the surrounding plains, and the Southfill River provided a good amount of catch. After 3200 NY (−659 DR) , the phaerimm 's draining of the environment caused the gradual loss of the farmlands, and the population began declining. By the time of Karsus's Folly only a few hundred holdouts remained, and by 3600 NY (−259 DR) the city was abandoned as the desert engulfed it.</p>
