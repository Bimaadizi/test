<p>The realm of Malabog was a region of the Feywild that served as the personal domain of King Malabog of the fomorian giants.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like the rest of the Feydark, Malabog's realm projected an eerily beautiful and dreadful atmosphere.</p>
<p>It was accessible from another region in the Feywild, by means of the Moonlight Gate portal.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The realm was divided into several smaller regions, including the High Cliffs, Barbican Ruins and the Outer Ward.</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>Among the spectacular flora that decorated the realm was a wide variety of plant life, particularly mushrooms and other fungi. Some specimens were exceptionally nourishing, while others were extremely toxic when consumed; yet others grew to gigantic proportions, great glowing mushrooms that were larger than most humanoids from Toril .</p>
<p>Due to the enslavement of other beings by Malabog and his armies, both dryads and portal hounds could be found within the realm, though typically under duress and dire circumstance.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After Malabog began his campaign of conquest against the elves of New Sharandar , circa the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the fomorian king's realm began to resemble a great war camp. Malabog's black knight Celadaine conscripted redcaps to begin construction of siege weaponry in preparation for the assault on the city. In response, the Iliyanbruen elves led by Merrisara Winterwhite launched their own counter-offensive. They established a small outpost near the High Cliffs region of the realm and struck out against the king and his allies.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The kingdom was home to Malabog's army of fey dark minions. At the head of these forces were the fomorian commanders, the powerful cyclops warriors, and the hordes of lesser creatures, namely fell trolls , quicklings , and redcaps .</p>
