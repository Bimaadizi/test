<p>Trobriand's Graveyard was the 13 th level of Undermountain , an area used as a scrap heap and arcane laboratory by the "Metal Mage" Trobriand . It was full of his rejected and half-completed experiments, some of which maintained an active existence forming a sort of makeshift societal hierarchy.</p>
<p>In addition to being the hierarchical domain of autonomous metallic rejections, the Graveyard was a playground of sorts for Trobriand. Its vast caverns and extensive halls were used to test his new and favored constructs.</p>
<p>The name "Trobriand's Graveyard" was coined by Halaster Blackcloak after it was shown to him by his former apprentice.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The layout of Trobriand's Graveyard resembled another one of Halaster's apprentices, Muiral the Misshapen . The various chambers and corridors were arranged in such a way they resembled a large scorpion with his tail and stinger splayed out to one side.</p>
<p>While many of the level's chambers were abuzz with activity and alight with the engines of industry, other rooms were grim and dead, full of scrap metal that once held magical energy or had the semblance of intelligence and life. A number of different unfortunate creatures found their home within the realm, from unwilling captives to opportunistic parasites and even rejected creations who managed to form a semblance of society.</p>

<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>For much of its history the Graveyard was dominated by the mechanical beings that served the "Metal Mage" Trobriand. They formed an ersatz society where the silversann constructs acted as a class of arcane scholars, thanatars served as protectors and enforcers, and the ferragans as a general workforce. They were led by the "enhanced" scaladar named Squch.</p>
<p>The thanatars served as the protectors of the Graveyard's social structure, neutralizing threats and disseminating them to the silversanns for future study. They interrogated threatening intruders and analyzed any magical weaponry upon which they came across.</p>
<p>In addition to the society of constructs, along with a few other metallic beings such as metal wasps and arbalests , the Graveyard was home to two magnificent, unique creations: the bore worm, a massive autonomous construct that vaguely resembled a purple worm and Shockerstomper , a favored creation of Trobriand that wandered throughout the Graveyard.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Each time he needed to dispose of a failed creation, Trobriand used his wand of rejecting to send it to the graveyard. He assumed that everything sent there was inactive, but later discovered that this was not the case, and became fascinated with the interactions between his failed creations. He then set about supplying the mechanical inhabitants of the graveyard with what they needed and experimenting with their reactions.</p>
<p>As of 1368 DR , the Graveyard was led by the scaladar known as Squch and populated with ten silversanns, twelve thanatars and up to thirty ferragans, as well as many more generic mechanical creatures.</p>
<p>Sometime during the 15 th century, a portion of the Graveyard was taken over by Zox Clammersham who taken leadership over some of Trobriand's metallic constructs. Additionally, a band of hobgoblins had infiltrated the domain under the leadership of Warlord Yargoth, who sought to free Zox from his leadership over the metal beings and claim the treasure of the Graveyard for their own.</p>
