<p>The Ringyl was a castle in Tresset's Ringyl .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Tresset's Ringyl was within a day's march from Felmorel . The town holding the castle was itself nestled in a valley between six hills.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The castle's towers were slender spires. It had tall battlements, and a wall.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Across one of the Ringyl's crumbling walls, there was a room that resembled a chapel, with a high and vaulted ceiling; the walls inside were painted to resemble trees with gilded fruit, and the floor had wavy bands of malachite . The far wall had a carving of a pair of lips, about as wide as a tall man's outstretched arms, surrounded by 12 or 14 irregular stars. Behind that carving was a hidden coffin on a catafalque . There was an underground level beneath the chapel.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>As of 761 DR , the castle's walls were fallen.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Once, a bandit by the name of Tresset had raised the castle to anchor a realm he'd dubbed Tressardon . The kingdom didn't survive him for more than a few days. As of the mid–8 th century DR , the castle and town were deserted, during Elminster Aumar 's wanderings in service of Mystra .</p>
<p>After the battle between Elminster and Silent Antlers , an obscure entity, the chapel inside the Ringyl crumbled apart, and the lips in the chapel shattered, a catafalque bursting out; in tilting over, the coffin fell through the ground into the lower level. Then it exploded. One of the arms of the catafalque, actually an enchanted scepter, was then reclaimed by Dasumia somehow, despite having been turned into dust by the explosion.</p>
