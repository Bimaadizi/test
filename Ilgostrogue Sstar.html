<h2>History</h2>
<h3>First Expedition</h3>
<p>Ilgostrogue Sstar was originally from Citadel Adbar . More than a thousand years prior to 1358 DR , Sstar led almost a quarter of the Northkingdom's population, 35,000 dwarves, on an expedition to Mirabar in search of riches. However, they faced daily attacks from orcs while crossing the mountains north of Sundabar , and by the time they reached Mirabar, their ranks had been decimated. A large number of dwarves became disenchanted with the terrible conditions on the northern road and chose to settle down in the safety of the city.</p>
<h3>Final Expedition</h3>
<p>Ilgostrogue became fixated on his goal to establish a great dwarven empire after his initial expedition. He then led the remaining loyal soldiers of his army towards the end of the Spine of the World , ultimately crossing into Icewind Dale . Not long later, the leader perished.</p>
<h3>Legacy</h3>
<p>Beerkanstrogue, Ilgostrogue's son, continued to honor his father's vision and convinced the remaining dwarves to found Ironmaster in a rocky dell close to where Ilgostrogue first looked out over the sea.</p>
