<p>Star pots , also called fire pots , were ceramic incendiary devices found in Zakhara , the Land of Fate.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>These ceramic jars were filled with liquid star and fitted with a thick wax wick . The jars were constructed to be strong enough to avoid accidents or light impacts and were typically used with siege engines , though they could be thrown by hand to great effect assuming the wielder was strong enough to ensure they shattered upon impact.</p>
<p>When shattered a star pot would douse any nearby objects with flaming liquid star oil. The liquid star burned for several minutes following the impact.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Given the inherent risk in their use, star pots were usually reserved for highly trained soldiers. Star pots were illegal in the Free Cities of Zakhara , though they could still be obtained on the black market for 55–100 gold pieces each.</p>
