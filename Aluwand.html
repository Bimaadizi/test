<p>Aluwand ( pronounced : / ɑː ˈ l uː w ɑː n d / ah-LOO-wand ) was the capital city of Selu'Maraar , a sea elf kingdom beneath the waves of the Dragon Reach .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>In relation to the surface world, Aluwand was located roughly 10 miles (16,000 meters) east of the Scar , somewhere around the Gloom depths of the Inner Sea .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>This city was the seat of power for the ruler of Selu'Maraar, who held the classical Faerûnian elf title of Coronal .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Aluwand was constructed around 713 DR by refugees of Cormanthyr , who had transformed themselves into sea elves through use of the artifact known as the Sashelan Glass . It later became incorporated into Selu'Maraar, which was founded in 921 TS (851 DR) by the Thuvys clan, but would not become its capital until much later.</p>
<p>Following the end of the disastrous Eleventh Serôs War in 1012 TS (942 DR) , the Thuvys clan was ousted from power in Selu'Maraar and the capital was moved to Aluwand. The title of Coronal was then adopted and Aolis Ildacer II was crowned as the kingdom's first coronal.</p>
<p>After the Twelfth Serôs War , the city was filled with a sense of unease as the Coronal Semphyr Ildacer 's must valuable agents, the elven high mages of Serôs, left him to join the Nantarn Council . Paranoid at what might happen in the future, Aluwandans began preparing themselves for a potential future conflict.</p>
