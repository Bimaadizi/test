<p>Lady Faveretti's Cookery Handbook for Erudite Young Girls (with an appendix on Poisoning for Beginners) was a five-volume collection of spellbooks aimed to teach young aspiring sorceresses the Art , published sometime long before 1217 DR .</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>The thick five volume set of spellbooks was written and bound in toadskin . This made the books quite odoriferous but waterproof.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1214 DR , Princess Milianna Mannicci da Sumbria discovered all five volumes for the Lady Faveretti's Cookery Handbook while digging in one of the moldy old crypts of the Palace of Sumbria , located in the palace's rose garden. By 1217 DR, Milianna haven't had much luck in studying the spells scribed in the books. She had to translate the arcane writings going in blind and trying to understand the spells with no training and in secret from her rancorous stepmother, Lady Ulia Mannicci . With time, her efforts somewhat paid off as she learned several cantrips and caused a few magical accidents and misfires. She painstakingly copied several spells onto toadskin scrolls and carried them with her, hidden in her hennin , studying the scribed magic when opportunity arose.</p>
