<p>Sharalyn Lockleaf was a half-elven Harper scout who stood against the sinister Order of the Crippled Fang and dreaded Zhentarim in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sharalyn was a charismatic blonde woman with bright eyes, a quick smile, and a beautiful singing voice. Her elven blood was noticeable by her slightly-pointed ears and slender frame. She wore simple, modest clothing and leathers, preferring the gentle green color of the woodlands. Many thought her to be a beautiful woman and even those who disliked elves found her quite mesmerizing.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Sharalyn Lockleaf never hid her real name and used her bardic profession as a cover to perform her Harper duties. She traveled across the Moonsea and reformed in inns and taverns across the region, where she made a living and collected gossip.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Even before meeting the Hero of Daggerford , Sharalyn Lockleaf was in awe of his reputation. She thought him to be the greatest hero who's traveled the Moonsea since the adventuring days of famed Shal Bal and Ren o' the Blade .</p>
<p>Lady Immithra Shrae of the Bounty of the Goddess was an old friend of Sharalyn's, and a trusted Harper ally.</p>
<p>Sharalyn Lockleaf had a personal history with Maalthiir of Hillsfar and wished him dead. The same dark past gave her an ally and a friend in Hillsfar – Kalor Onehand , an Officer of the Red Plumes .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the winter of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , strife and discord shook the trade routes of the Moonsea . A sinister new organization rose to terrorize the southern Moonsea region – the Order of the Crippled Fang. It was known for flooding the roads with fiends from lower planes . Several weeks after the cult's attacks started, many communities of the Moonsea were in a state of panic, especially after an attack on Teshwave and constant presence along the Shind Road . During that time, Sharalyn was spying on the Zhentish activities in the city of Voonlar – listening on Buorstag Hlammythyl in the Swords Meet tavern. She learned that no one knew the origins of the cult nor its goals. Even the Black Network was stumped, assuming Hillsfar 's machinations behind it. Another thing was clear to Sharalyn, the Order of the Crippled Fang seemed to target the Zhentarim operations. At the Swords Meet tavern, she met the Hero of Daggerford, who was dragged into a confrontation with the Zhentarim. The Hero was challenged to a duel by Bron, who was promptly knocked out. Immediately after, the town was attacked by the Order. Sharalyn, along with city guards, several other adventurers, and the Hero of Daggerford, defended the settlement from an army of fiends.</p>
<p>The morning after the attack, Sharalyn Lockleaf addressed the newcomer, revealing her status as a Harper. She led the Hero of Daggerford to recruit several other brave adventurers who helped defend Voonlar – a noble from Mulmaster Astar Graysteel , haughty Waterdhavian wuzard Eremuth Silverwind , and a mysterious undead woman named Lyressa . Once in the privacy of a room in Swords Meet, Sharalyn revealed that her contacts in Shadowdale knew of the Hero's travel and informed her of his eventual arrival to Voonlar and was sure that he would be willing to help her cause. Harpers were dedicated to balance of power, and despite being enemies of the Zhentarim, the truth of the situation was that without its protection, many of the innocents who lived in Zheng-controlled settlements would suffer under the attacks of the Order, and eventually, the entire region would become unprotected and vulnerable. Vulnerable Moonsea meant it would be served to Hillsfar on a silver platter, and Hillsfar was infamous for its extreme hate towards non-humans. Begrudgingly, Sharalyn Lockleaf asked for the hero's help to stop the new threat to the Zhentarim.</p>
