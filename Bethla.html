<p>Bethla was a priestess of Ilmater in the late-13 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to 1281 DR , Bethla lived in an Ilmatari monastery that was located just outside of Illefarn . On that year Incylia and the rest of her fellow clergymen had their minds dominated by an Ilmtari priest named Poquelin, who in reality was the devil Belhifet in disguise.</p>
<p>Mesmerized by Poquelin, Bethla and the other Ilmatari followed him north into the region of Icewind Dale . They then traveled through the Kuldahar Pass , losing many of their fellow clergymen along the way, and down into the ruins of the dwarven fortress Dorn's Deep .</p>
<p>In the Lower Depths of these ruins she and four others were instructed to guard the magical idol inside what had once been a temple to the dwarven god Berronar Truesilver . While guarding the idol she and the other Ilmatari were individually surrounded by a magical barrier. Overtime they watched as Poquelin became more militant and fascist, but the magic of the idol had them too enthralled to resist and made them believe his words superseded the gospel of Ilmatar. Those outside the idol's range tried to resist him and for their efforts were transformed into undead guardians for the idol, such as boneguards , mummies , and zombies .</p>
<p>Eventually, a group of adventurers arrived that year and destroyed the idol, thus freeing Bethla and the rest of her fellow Ilmatari from its dominating effect. Once freed Bethla was deeply remorseful for the actions she had committed while under its domination and prayed for forgiveness from Ilmater.</p>
