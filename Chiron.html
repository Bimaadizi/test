<p>Chiron was a son of Cronus , ruler of the Greater Titans , and a guardian of the crumbled palace atop Mount Othrys . He was once an immortal being with the status of a deity , but voluntarily renounced it and became a mortal.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Chiron looked like a centaur , with a horse half that was tawny in coloration. However, his body was far larger, with his humanoid torso and upper body altogether being taller than most giants . Overall he stood 30 feet (9.1 meters).</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Chiron was an avaricious man, using his position as a guard to amass treasure just for the sake of it. He didn't appreciate any implications that someone had power over him. Chiron also highly valued honesty and respect.</p>
<p>Prior to living in Carceri, Chiron was a more good-natured individual known for his wisdom.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>After renouncing his immortality Chiron retained some remarkable traits. His body had an incredibly fast regenerative factor and an immunity to the two things that would normally hamper regeneration for a creature, acid and fire . The awareness he had of the palace he protected was also keen to the point of a dragon , making it impossible for people to fool him with such spells as invisibility or non-detection .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Owned a sword , longbow , and quiver of arrows that were all appropriate for his size, the latter being comparable to a ballista bolt. He also carried around a large leather bag full of his valuables.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Demanded a "fair" tribute of anyone that wished to have an audience with his father, such as a magical item or thousands of gold pieces . He was willing to bargain over such tributes, but never haggle, and only did so in an arbitrary so as to inflate his own arrogance. Any attempts question his demand of tribute was viewed as disrespectful and he would make cruel threats upon those who hesitated to comply. If the person being asked tribute of showed him blatant dishonesty or disrespect, Chiron would double his demanded exchange.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In his youth Chiron lived in a land that consisted of a collection of city-states , the same land that some early planar immigrants to Toril would later hail from. There he learned the arts of hunting and medicine from the Olympian powers Artemis and Apollo . Over time his fame and skill in these fields became revered by deities and mortals alike. He went on to train many adventurers and made a home for himself in a large centaur colony.</p>
<p>At some point Chiron renounced his immortality and resigned himself to living in Carceri's layer of Othrys with his father Cronus.</p>
<p>In the month of Hammer , in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , a group of adventurers from Ravens Bluff found themselves transported to the plane of Carceri after defending the githzerai fortress of Tah'Darr from a tanar'ri incursion. At the urgings of the fallen paladin Elendil , the adventurers sought out Mount Othrys and Cronus for a way back to Toril. When they first entered the crumbling palace they were greeted by a 50 ft (15 m) tall marble pillar, with a column of twenty spears jammed down one crack, each impaled with the severed head of a man that had previously given Chiron trouble. They were then approached by Chiron, who demanded tribute from them in exchange for an audience with his father. Chiron warned the mortals not to comment on the palace's crumbling marble and that his father was currently hosting a visiting group of tanar'ri. Finally, Chiron metioned that Elendil's captive friend Uri had been involved in combat with the tanar'ri, but had no idea what the battle's outcome was.</p>
<p>When the group got their audience with Cronus he was deep into some kind of Cosmic Game with the marilith Cucathne , the latter of whom was entertaining the titan with the game in hopes of negotiating the use of Othrys as a tanar'ri staging ground against Tah'Darr. Cronus was unwilling to answer any questions that the mortals posed, but offered to gate them home if they would fight as part of his forces in the game.</p>
