<p>The galleass was a large type of ship that resembled a cross between a galley and a galleon .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Galleasses were extremely large ships that had both sails and rowers, with the intent to have the seaworthiness and strength of a galleon and the speed and agility of a galley. Despite these ambitions, the galley-derived form meant that it lacked the stability for true oceanic travel.</p>
<p>When under sail, the galleass was much more sluggish than other sailships, but its rowers could bring it up to a respectable speed that was even more pronounced in adverse wind conditions that would cripple other ships.</p>
<p>A galleass could make good use of its speed and maneuverability with its ship ram , and would easily fit ballistae on the deck.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Galleasses had very large cargo holds, and so worked best as merchant ships along coastal waters, but could still be used as warships when equipped with large marine detachments.</p>
