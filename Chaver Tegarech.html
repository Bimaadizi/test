<p>Chaver Tegarech was an aide to First Speaker Tessarin Alaurun in Nesmé . In 1374 DR he rode from Nesmé to check upon a watchpost at Morach Tor and was kidnapped by the Khoroshen tribe of lizardfolk , who had been hired to protect the town against attack from giants and trolls . The lizardfolk betrayed Alaurun and Nesmé. Tegarech overheard a conversation between the lizardfolk and the trolls, to decide upon how to split Nesmé and its surrounding lands, and was captured. He was taken to Baeniff Tor via a small settlement at Morach Tor , where he scratched his initials, CT, and his destination, BT, into a wooden wall.</p>
