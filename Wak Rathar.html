<p>Wak Rathar was a wizard living in Hillsfar in 1367 DR . As an old friend of Lord Maalthiir , he was permitted to do all he wished.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Wak had a sick sense of humor. He enjoyed sending people into the Arena for only the sport of it. One of this tricks was offering adventurers a demonstration of magic, then disappearing and leaving a pile of gold behind, gold he later claimed was stolen. Alternatively, Wak would ask "want to see a magic trick?" and disappear with the unwitting victim's magic items.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Wak Rathar targeted adventurer Mhai the Mage , offering to show him a magic trick. Mahai fell for such ploy once before and promptly turned the old mage down. As of the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , Wak Rathar's eccentric and cruel antics made him even less popular than Lord Maalthiir. Due to this foul reputation, Mordak Brelliar was virulently advising the city's ruler to distance himself from the old wizard. Mordak's advice came from fear of Rathar's future grab for power.</p>
