<p>Lady Morgwais Nightmeadow , sometimes known as the Lady of the Wood or the Red Lady , was the wood elf ruler of Reitheillaethor in the High Forest during the 14 th and 15 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She had long auburn hair and a copper-red complexion.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The Lady of the Wood had a wry sense of humor and like others of her kind could be quite flirtatious to those she found worthy of her attention. While she sparkled with merriment and held a joyous celebration for life, Lady Morgwais was a well-respected leader among the elves of her village and the surrounding High Forest. She remained vigilant against any threat that may have had a chance to harm her people.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Lady Morgwais served as the head of the Caerilcarn , also known as the "Council of the Wood", a gathering of leaders from among the wood elf tribes of the High Forest and moon elves of the Silver Marches .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Morgwais was the former lover and partner to Aubric Nihmedu , Blademajor of the Swords of Evereska . During their time together she became a mother twice over, helping raise their son Galaeron , a sentry of the Evereskan Tomb Guard , and Keya , one of the youngest members of the city's Long Watch . Morgwais' relationship with Galaeron became troubled after he began his studies of shadow magic , and the two no longer shared the extrasensory bond held by elven family members.</p>
<p>Though she thought very little of humans , Morgwais had a flirtatious relationship with the Elminster and held him in high regard.</p>
<p>Morgwais had an uneven relationship with Turlang , the treant master of the High Forest. While at one time she trusted the ancient and thoughtful treant, and he in turn respected her sense of judgement, their relationship became troubled over the course of the many decades.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Morgwais met her mate Aubric when a war broke out between the elves of the High Forest and a band of orcs . Enamored with the bladesinger from Evereska , she reloacted with him to the elven Last Home and started a family with one another. Over the span of 60 years they raised their two children within the city. After a third elven babe died in childbirth, Morgwais became heartbroken and blamed her own unhappiness for the child's death. She returned to her home in the High Forest shortly after.</p>
<p>Over time she came to lead the newly-founded wood elf settlement of Reitheillaethor and arose as a leader among many elves in the North .</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, Morgwais had began to lead the Caerilcarn's efforts to restore the long-lost kingdom of Eaerlann and reunite the nomadical elves of the High Forest under a shared banner.</p>
