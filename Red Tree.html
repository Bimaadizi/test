<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Ashenwood became afflicted by a mysterious blight that started withering trees and drove treants berserk. The hero known as Kalach-Cha witnessed the blight firsthand when the group arrived at the frost in search of the Wood Man , a nature spirit and forest guardian. In attempts to cure the outbreak, Kalach-Cha resorted to asking the goddess Chauntea for aid through anointing in a sacred brew and praying at the base of the Red Tree. The goddess responded and let the heroes know with a wave of warmth that radiated from the tree and penetrated the adventurers' bodies, sating the Spirit-Eater's hunger for a blissful moment.</p>
