<h2>History</h2>
<p>Eadred was one of the paladin members of Myth Drannor's Akh'Velahr under Hachaam Selorn's command. Sometime before the start of the Weeping War, Eadred and Hachaam visited one of the ancient tombs in Glim-Gardens , the Cold Knight's Barrow, also known as the Tomb of Eternal Sleep, which was home to a powerful wight who was plaguing the City of Song. Together the two Akh'Velahr managed to slay the ravenous undead , but Hachaam was trapped in frozen stasis by the wight's final spell, appearing cold and eternally in stasis. In 712 DR, when the danger of the looming war became apparent, Eadred returned to the barrow by the House Ammath mansion, seeking the way to free the commander whose leadership was needed. He managed to take Hachaam's place in eternal slumber, freeing the Arm-Captain just in time for him to lead Myth Drannor's forces against the invading Army of Darkness that succeeded in destroying the city in 714 DR . With the city being gone, no-one was left alive who could rescue the paladin, leaving him trapped inside the ancient tomb.</p>
<p>In 1369 DR , a group of adventurers came across the cursed man. The Veiled Ones were on a quest to stop the Cult of the Dragon 's corruption of the mythal and the pool of radiance within the ruins of Myth Drannor. Seeing the man, one of the heroes grasped the sword in the altar and was taken by the curse. This act of unintended kindness freed Eadred for the first time in centuries. He Joined the heroes in the quest to stop vile Kya Mordrayn , but eventually, reclaimed his prison, freeing the trapped hero.</p>
