<p>Fharaud was a wealthy shipbuilder who lived in Innarlith in the mid–14 th century DR.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1358 DR , Fharaud traveled to Marsember in Cormyr , along with Senator Inthelph , in order to attend a recruiting event held at a college for studying engineering. He was looking to hire a graduate from the college to help him with a project to build a massive ship for the King of Cormyr that was going to be named the Everwind . He met Ivar Devorast at the event and was impressed with his designs. He recruited Devorast to help him with his project and brought him back to Innarlith.</p>
<p>Devorast helped Fharaud complete the ship. The ship was supposed to be transported through a magic portal from the Lake of Steam to the Vilhon Reach , where representatives from Cormyr's navy would take it. However, Devorast distrusted the idea of sending the ship through a portal.</p>
<p>In 1360 DR , the ship was completed and it was launched. Fharaud and a skeleton crew took control of the ship while Devorast remained on shore. When the ship went through the portal, the portal caused the ship to break into pieces and fall from a height above the area where it was supposed to go. Fharaud survived the accident, but he was badly injured and became bedridden. Devorast visited him frequently in the years following the accident.</p>
<p>He died from his injuries in 1364 DR . Shortly before he passed away, however, he wrote a letter to Ransar Osorkon recommending Devorast to him as well as Devorast's idea of building a canal between the Lake of Steam and the Nagaflow .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Ransar Osorkon respected Fharaud and was still impressed with Fharaud's work in building ships, even when he was considered disgraced after the accident with the Everwind .</p>
<p>Ivar Devorast worked for Fharaud and had some personal loyalty to him. After Fharaud's accident with the Everwind , Devorast went to visit him frequently while he was bedridden and helped take care of him.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>At the end of his life after his accident, he began having visions of the future. He explained that this had something to do with what happened to me while he travelled through the portal that was supposed to transport the Everwind.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>It was widely rumored that the reason for the accident with the Everwind was because the ship was too large for the portal.</p>
