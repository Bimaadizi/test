<p>Oxal Ekkam was a half-orc druid of Eberron 's Gatekeepers , during the late 14 th century DR of Faer√ªn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Oxal had long gray hair and tan skin.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Elven Crusade , a portal opened between the Myth Drannor outskirts camp and the Gatekeeper's Grove in Stormreach . Oxal kept a cautious eye on it, wary of the recent episode in which the Spinner of Shadows and Lolth almost destroyed Eberron. Fortunately, the only thing on the other side were the Elves of Cormanthor and their planar sage Pyndil Bospin , and so both sides were more than happy to tolerate and ignore a portal that didn't produce things like demons .</p>
