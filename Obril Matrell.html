<p>Obril Matrell was one of the three siblings, the second generation of House Matrell , a noble mercantile family of Arrabar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Obril Matrell was born on the 25 th of Ches , the Year of the Tired Treant, 1318 DR . Growing up, Obril, along with his siblings Hesta , Dregaul , and Xaphira Matrell were ostracized by nobles of Arrabar for being a young merchant house with no social weight behind their name. Through his life, however, House Matrell gained prominence and success due to the leadership of Obril's parents, Hetta Debrinne , and Obiron Matrell I . At some point before his death, Obril married Ladara Lazelle Matrell and sired three children Vambran , Emriana , and Evester Matrell . He never got to see his children grow up as he died quite young, on the 18 th of Elient , the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR . His youngest children were too young, so they had few memories of their father. Vambran was only four and Emriana - one. Obril's older son, Evester inherited the man's good looks as was evident by a huge portrait that hung in Hetta Debrinne Matrell's sitting room, above a fireplace.</p>
