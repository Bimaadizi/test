<p>An ardent was a spiritual warrior of psionics that emerged on Toril in the nine-decades following the Spellplague . Their mastery of the Invisible Art was driven and empowered by emotions and emotional energy , taking their focus on emotions farther than other manifesters. They were akin to a warlord among the various types of psionic wielders.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>The form of psionics that ardents wielded required some discipline and careful study, though their psionic journey rarely ever began with formal training, rather manifesting spontaneously one day. It was said that without basic empathic capacities, no amount of studying could make one an ardent. Many ardents took on the path of a wandering adventurer , as their powers of emotion manipulation often drew wedges in the life they were living prior to psionically awakening. In the land of Kara-Tur , some took to the path of a sohei in obscure religious sects that focused on the power of the mind.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of their powers, ardents were highly emotional people. They often felt emotions to extreme degrees, sometimes overreacting at people, and became rather emotionally driven or impulsive. Some reacted negatively to these changes, trying to force a projection of stoicism, rarely speaking, growing jaded of the emotions of others, or avoiding large groups in order to avoid encountering strong emotions.</p>
<p>Others embraced the flow of emotions, becoming boisterous, but more often becoming solicitous, sympathetic, and kind. Some even traveled in search of experiences with strong emotions. Such ardents hoped that exposure would help them to better master their control over emotions, prepare them for unexpected encounters with strong emotions, and learn how to harness such emotional energy to empower their psionic powers.</p>
<p>The emotions that flooded out of mortal creatures upon their death could have long lasting repercussions upon an ardent. They may become despondent for some time afterwards, jump headlong into another adventure in hopes that it might help clear their minds of the incident, or they might go so far to vow never to kill again, making exceptions only for the most vile of creatures.</p>
<p>Among the sentient races of the world, those most drawn to the path of the ardent were humans and half-elves , followed by dragonborn , halflings , and gnomes . Beyond Toril, ardents could be found on the worlds of Nerath and Athas .</p>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>The deities that ardents most gravitated towards were of a wild and unpredictable nature, often favoring those who included war or the wilderness among their portfolio . Ardents of an evil bent might favor the god Gruumsh .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>In the eyes of an ardent, raw emotions could dominate the mind, leaving them vulnerable to mental attacks and possibly causing madness when left to fester for too long, such as fear, hatred, greed, lust, or sorrow. To protect themselves from the hazardous effects of such emotions, ardents sought to learned to safeguard their minds by donning certain emotional states, which they called mantles. Through a mantle an ardent controlled and channeled their emotions. The powers accessible to an ardent did not vary depending upon their mantle, as they drew upon all emotions, but it was the emotion which they most frequently drew from. In some cases an ardent used their mantle to shun negative strong emotions, jettisoning them from their mind.</p>
<p>Whenever they used their powers, an ardent's emotions would be transmitted along with the power's effect into the targeted creatures, instilling them with an appropriate emotion. Some weak willed ardents especially struggled to restrain their emotions and would let them flood out whenever they fought. Ardents could also absorb the emotions of others to add to their own power, a power that largely went unnoticeable. They could empathically feel the emotions of those around them and might take on aspects of those feelings. And they could project their own emotions onto those around them. Neither phenomenon enacted an instant change in an individual's behavior, though might create subtle long-term effects. And if a group of ardents gathered together to project their emotions, it could have a substantial impact on surrounding mindsets and emotional states.</p>
<p>Every use of their power was accompanied by a material display in the form of a corona of light that flared and swirled around the ardent's head. This light took on different hues and intensities depending upon their mood, such as red for anger or black for fear, and would also intensify in its radiance whenever the ardent augmented their powers. In some cases this aura took on recognizable shapes depending upon the individual, such as the silhouette of an angel or weapon. In other cases this aura was found to make certain displays depending upon the psionic power being used, such as armor or a shield when a defensive power was used.</p>
<p>All ardents exhibited a basic power to inspire their allies when injured, to unbalance enemies when injured, and to unleash a powerful surge of emotion to heal themselves or an ally. This surge displayed additional minor effects depending upon what emotional state the ardent was adorned in.</p>
<p>In battle they were equally capable martial combatants, usually taking to the front-line and becoming incidental leaders. Through their power over emotions they mentally encouraged their allies, guarded their minds against despair and other negative emotions, soothed their injuries with the emotion of love, injured their foes with blasts of anger, and exciting certain emotions in the minds of enemies to cause them to falter in their defenses.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>For most of the general populace of the Realms, psionics and those wielded it were unrecognized or barely understood, often confused with traditional spellcasters of magic . Consequently, a commoner 's view of a psionics user could differ little from their attitude and reactions towards arcane spellcasters, which in many cases could mean a sense of distrust. As the least understood of psionics users, many being unable to recognize them as such, this posed an issue for ardents. Their abilities to magnify or reflect back ambient emotions could lead to these initial feelings of distrust being amplified.</p>
<p>The far more disciplined likes of monks and psions often questioned the discipline of ardents, due largely in part to their emotional and impulsive nature, viewing them as wild cards that lacked the self-control necessary to master the powers they wielded. Psions in particular, often valuing logical processes over instinct, would philosophically butt heads with ardents. Battleminds were more accepting of their abilities, but their propensity for shutting themselves off from emotions was incomprehensible to ardents.</p>
