<p>Orluth Angalaer was one of the Magelords of Athalantar in the early 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He had dark robes and an elegant hand.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The man was supremely overconfident.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He strongly implied at least one of his spells responded to attacks.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the elimination of the Velvet Hands gang of Athalantar in the Year of the Black Flame, 229 DR , some of the Moonclaws , a rival gang, were captured by the Magelords. The captured Moonclaws told the Magelords about the preferred hideout of the Velvet Hands. One of the magelords, Orluth Angalaer, decided to lie in wait there, expecting that any surviving Velvet Hands wouldn't return for at least one day.</p>
<p>He was in wait when Elminster Aumar , one of the thieves of the Velvet Hands, arrived at the hideout. He tried to taunt him into attacking him so as to try out a spell, but Elminster instead triggered an enchanted ring akin to a ring of the ram that he inherited from a fellow Velvet Hand, Tassabra . The strike hurled Orluth out the window, and impaled him on the poles of a fish cart, killing him.</p>
