<p>T'u Lung was a language spoken by the inhabitants of T'u Lung in Kara-Tur . It was of the Shou Chiang languages group.</p>
<p>It came from the same root tongue as Kao te Shou , the language of Shou Lung . The grammar remained the same, but the dialects varied much more dramatically, as the feudal boundaries of T'u Lung were much more rigid. The regional variations and accents could make it sometimes difficult to understand.</p>
