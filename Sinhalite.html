<p>Sinhalite was a rare find in streambed gravel, both active streams and ancient, dried up riverbeds. When polished cabochon or cut, these fancy stones were called sinhalas .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In natural form, these crystals were rounded pebbles, tumbled and smoothed by water action. They were yellow-brown to pale straw-yellow and yielded gemstones up to 1 in (2.5 cm) in diameter. A typical specimen had a base value of 100 gp.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A sinhala could prevent magical darkness in a 20 ft (6.1 m) radius around the stone.</p>
