<p>The Maiden's Tears was a set of diamonds used in a piece of jewelry in the early 14 th century DR before being famously stolen in Turmish .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They comprised a set of fourteen matching diamonds , each one clear, polished, and cut in a teardrop shape, hence their name. These were suspended from a fine wire so they could be worn as a pectoral necklace by a woman (particularly one of large bust).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Maiden's Tears were worn by a noblewoman of Tethyr who visited Alaghôn in Turmish for a grand feast in the 1330s DR . The evening included dancing inside a globe of conjured light and sound, where the diamonds were snatched off her chest. Her consort was a powerful mage, who immediately cast a spell that briefly immobilized every person in the hall before declaring he was magically examining their minds to identify the culprit. He had his bodyguard fire a sleep-poisoned hand crossbow at everyone who tried to run the moment they could move again. But the mage had been bluffing, and it backfired badly—fifteen men and women had run, and at least six were allergic to the poison and died convulsing.</p>
<p>In the aftermath, the thief, if even among them, could not be identified and the jewels could not be found, despite all the magical questioning and investigation that followed. If the thief had used magic to teleport or otherwise spirit away the Maiden's Tears, this was supposed to have disturbed the dancing globe and been indicated on it, but no sign was found. Therefore, it was concluded the diamonds must still be inside the hall. The mage ordered an extensive search, turning up storage caches beneath the flagstones and secret compartments behind movable carvings on the ornate pillars, but no Maiden's Tears.</p>
<p>In later years, the hall was fully renovated and rebuilt, yet still the Maiden's Tears were not found. They remained a famous lost treasure tale of Alaghôn by around 1360 DR .</p>
