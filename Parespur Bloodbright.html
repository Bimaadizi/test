<p>Lord Parespur Bloodbright a noble in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Parespur hired the coinlass Amarune Whitewave to be his escort for the Open Feast held in Castle Obarskyr , Suzail , Cormyr , in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , being quite fastidious about the fact he wanted to be seen with her downright wrapped around him. He also dragged her off from at least one conversation when her interest turned to eavesdropping. Like Amarune, he took notice of the fact that Ganrahast left the banquet abruptly.</p>
