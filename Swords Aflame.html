<p>The Swords Aflame were an adventuring party in the late 9 th century DR . Taline Telgara joined them at a Magefair ; they numbered at least two more wizards at the time. While she was with them, the Swords Aflame breached a number of dungeons looking for old magic; at one point, they came to have no less than forty spellbooks to study. The party split because of growing rivalries and disastrous expeditions prior to the year 902Â DR .</p>
