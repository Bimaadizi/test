<h2>History</h2>
<p>A svirfneblin expedition, among which numbered Brickers , Belwar Dissengulp , and Drizzt Do'Urden , encountered Bruck's tribe. In the hopes of avoiding conflict, they conducted a ruse in which Drizzt claimed drow dominion over the surroundings and the svirfneblin as slaves , and successfully intimidated Bruck to leave. Some time later, the tribe was accosted by the reanimated Zaknafein Do'Urden , who, in his bloodlust, slayed Bruck and some fifteen other goblins.</p>
