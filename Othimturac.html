<p>Othimturac was a shadow white dragon bred by the Jaezred Chaulssin of Karsoluthiyl .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As part of an experiment, the Jaezred Chaulssin of Karsoluthiyl crossbred various kinds of chromatic dragons with shadow dragons in order to create a more suitable race. However, only Othimturac, the white dragon offspring, survived (the Jaezred speculated that it was his immunity to cold that permitted his survival). He was later used as a guard for the tower of House Oussgym , the local Jaezred headquarters. In 1374 DR , he was eventually defeated by an adventuring party that had infiltrated the tower.</p>
