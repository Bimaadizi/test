<p>Blast spikes were a type of dwarven mining tool.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Blast spikes were three-sided, pointed wedges constructed of fine steel . They had wide, circular heads to ensure efficient hammering. They were roughly the length of an adult human 's hand.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Blast spikes could only be activated by being struck with another. To ensure their safety, users typically did this by either throwing their second blast spike or strapping it to a long pole and then ramming it into the first. Once struck by another, blast spikes would unleash a large, violent explosion.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Blast spikes were designed primarily dangerous situations in which splitting or shattering a rock was required, such as removing blockages from underground rivers or waterfalls. However, they were just as easily hammered into trees, wooden structures, and even refined stone walls.</p>
<p>In many deep dwarven caverns there were known to have been blast spikes placed, yet never activated, being used as a sort of climbing hold instead of an explosive. In terms of other alternative uses, some dwarves were known to utilize blast spikes as weapons.</p>
