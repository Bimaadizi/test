<p>Turnstone Pass was a valley in the Nether Mountains .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The pass was close to the northern edges of High forest .</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>The region had a bad reputation. According to some rumors, the area was infested by daemonfey , Fey'ri , and half-fiends of House Dlardrageth .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 872 DR , the road from Sundabar to Ascalhorn wound its way through the pass.</p>
<p>In 1343 DR , the Moonlight Men mercenary company sacrificed their lives at Turnstone Pass fending off an approaching horde of orcs , slaying over 4,000 in total, in the Battle of Turnstone Pass .</p>
<p>In the mid-14 th century DR , as part of a joint effort to protect the North from unchecked incursions by the forces of Hellgate Keep , the pass was garrisoned by humans and dwarves from Citadel Adbar , Everlund , Silverymoon , and Sundabar. Those stationed here had to fight almost constantly in order to hold the pass.</p>
<p>In weeks following the destruction of Hellgate Keep in 1369 DR , a massive avalanche occurred that blocked off Turnstone Pass and access to the Upvale . Most blamed this incident on the treant forces of Turlang and some galeb duhr , while some believed that it may have been the work of Alustriel Silverhand .</p>
<p>By 1372 DR , the valley was mostly wilderness.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Because of the events of the Battle of Turnstone Pass, the goddess Sel√ªne placed a special blessing upon the valley. Anyone who prayed to her when in the pass was granted invisibility against orcs or any persons with any trace of orc blood in their ancestry. Like the effects of the spell invisibility , this protection only lasted as long as the receiver of this boon did not attack anyone else. Such a blessing was only granted to any individual once per month, and she never granted it to anyone with orc blood, no matter how faint.</p>
