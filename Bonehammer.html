<p>Bonehammer was a henchman, or perhaps pet, to the Talontar blightlord Damanda in 1373 DR . He was a pale giant clad only in tattooed grotesque scenes of depravity, who sometimes spewed poems. He fought on his mistress' side when Marrec 's party caught up to her, though both vampires fled the fight when it turned against them. Bonehammer was ultimately speared by a shaft of natural sunlight while fighting Gunggari Ulmarra at his mistress' hideout.</p>
