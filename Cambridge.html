<p>The Cambridge family were a Ffolk royal line in the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Like all royal families of the Moonshaes, the Cambridges traced their lineage to the Cymrych family of High Kings and Queens. However, following the decline of the Cymrych dynasty in the 10 th century DR, the Cambridges allowed the spelling and pronunciation of their name to change in order to better differentiate themselves from other Cymrych families.</p>
<p>The Cambridges remained a recognizable royal name as of the midâ€“14 th century DR , alongside the Kendricks of Corwell , the Kimballs of Moray , and the Kincaids of Snowdown .</p>
