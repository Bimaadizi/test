<p>A Cli lyre ( pronounced : / k l i / klee ) was a masterwork magic lyre and one of the Instruments of the Bards .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cli lyres were superior in every way to ordinary lyres. Like other Instruments of the Bards, they could only be used properly by bards , and could be dangerous if anyone else attempted to play or even carry them.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Bards wielding a Cli lyre had their charming abilities greatly amplified by their magic.</p>
<p>Like all Instruments of the Bards, these lyres had the capability of storing spells. A bard playing a Cli lyre could invoke the spells fly , invisibility , levitate , protection from evil and good , stone shape , wall of fire and wind wall each once a day, until the instrument recharged its magic at the next dawn.</p>
<p>Lesser versions of Cli lyres allowed for casting the haste , remove curse , and sound burst spells.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first Cli lyres were created by a legendary bard in the Moonshae Isles named Falataer . He used them to test and reward the students of the Cli level of his bardic college, which came to be regarded individually as a legendary bard college in its own right.</p>
<p>Over time, other bards have copied the original design, while retaining the original name in Falataer's honor.</p>
<p>Circa 1372 DR several powerful magical items, including a Cli lyre , were brought to Toril by a planeswalking wizard Vejoni H. Wyzz who perched his extraplanar tent just outside the town of Liam's Hold .</p>
<p>A mundane but exquisitely crafted Falataeric Cli lyre was sold at the Chromatic Scale of Baldur's Gate in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . It was believed that it was one of the twenty surviving lyres hand-crafted by Falataer of the Moonshaes.</p>
