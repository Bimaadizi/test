<p>In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Gehorg Diamondforge and many other stores of Ravens Bluff's Market District fell victim to extortion by a group of criminals. These people— Marella , Elizza , Moamar , and Rundell —were members of the warlord Myrkyssa Jelan 's army that waged war on the Vast just a year prior. Gehorg spent years of his life creating weapons of great power through the ancient dwarven art of song-smithing. The master smith lost several magic weapons to the extortionists: Stone Splitter , Icicle , Flame Quencher , and Starshine . This loss disillusioned Gehorg Diamondforge, and he decided to leave Ravens Bluff and its corruption unless the city was to reimburse him for the masterworks lost to the people whom he perceived to be Living City watchmen.</p>
