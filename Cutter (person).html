<p>Lord Cutter , previously known as Ravendas , was a ruthless and power hungry agent of the Zhentarim and briefly the puppet tyrant of Iriaebor .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After traveling to Baldur's Gate in order to learn martial skills, Ravendas's lust for power led her to Darkhold , where she sought membership in the Zhentarim. Sememmon himself gave her a task that she completed with ruthless efficiency, rising quickly through the organization's ranks.</p>
<p>In about 1355 DR , the Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon , which included her sister Kera and her lover Caledan , captured Ravendas after defeating her army at Hluthvar . Once she was alone with Kera, Ravendas convinced her Harper sister to release her and then strangled her with the bonds that previously held her.</p>
<p>In 1362 DR , Cutter and her Zhentish forces conquered the city of Iriaebor , gaining control of the city and its trade routes. While looting Iriaebor of its valuables, Cutter sought and eventually found the crypt of the Shadowking deep beneath the city.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
