<p>Skabatha Nightshade , also known as Granny Nightshade , was one of the three hags of the Hourglass Coven that took control of Prismeer , a Domain of Delight in the Feywild .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was a short gaunt woman wearing layers of tattered dresses, resembling doll's clothes. She wore heavy painted-on makeup that didn't fully cover her skin, which resembles cracked wood. Being partly a toy, she had a wind-up key in her back that was permanently attached as much as a limb; it turned quickly when she was happy and slowed or even stopped when she was sad or angry. One eye socket was empty and the other held a wooden eye that she could remove at will.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>More ambitious and entrepreneurial than her sisters, she had a toy factory, textile mill, and goblin market, while also maintaining a garden and practicing sewing and cooking.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>She could shrink herself down to the size of a toy, which she used each night to fit into the dollhouse in which she slept.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>She rode upon a flying rocking horse , which had once been the unicorn Elidon until the Hourglass Coven removed its horn and transformed it.</p>
<p>She possessed a magic mirror just like her sisters' that, when given the command word "bandersnatch", became a swirling mist that acted as a portal to the Hall of Illusions in the Witchlight Carnival.</p>
<p>She had a jar of moths that she kept near the dollhouse. Because of her curse that caused her to forget the first creature she saw each morning, she purposefully looked into the jar each morning so that her curse caused her to forget one of the moths for the day rather than a more threatening creature.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>She spent the first few hours of her day in her garden tending to her plants, mushrooms, compost heap, and animals ( goats and pigs ). She spent most of the rest of her day in the kitchen cooking for the children and making candies for the goblin market, occasionally spending time in her study. In the evening, she made the rounds, inspecting her sewing room, textile mill, and workshop. Finally, she shrinked down into her dollhouse where she slept.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She was a daughter of Baba Yaga and elder sister to Bavlorna Blightstraw and Endelyn Moongrave , and step-sister to their adopted sister Natasha .</p>
