<p>The ritiik was a member of the spear family of polearms , used in the polar regions of Toril , such as the Great Glacier .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The weapons were made of bone and measured 6 feet (1.8 meters) in length, with a weight of around 4 pounds (1.8 kilograms). In addition to a pointed spear head, ritiiks had an additional hook-like blade that protruded from the spearhead's base. In some lands, this weapon could sell for as much as 5 gold pieces .</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>The ritiik was designed for the purpose of attacking large animals found in cold environs, such as polar bears . Whenever the shaft of this weapon managed to pierce the flesh of a creature, the spear head would then be jerked backed so that its hook could dig into the flesh, potentially allowing for them to be dragged down to the ground.</p>
