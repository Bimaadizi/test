<p>Pteranodons ( pronounced : / t ɛ r ˈ æ n oʊ d ɑː n / ter-ÆN-o-dan ), sometimes spelled pteranadon and also known as airdragons as well as tuurus in the Old Empires , were ranked among the dinosaurs . They were large behemoths encountered in the wild and even occasionally trained for use as flying mounts, much like dragons , albeit with less intelligence.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A pteranodon was a birdlike reptile with sharp talons and leathery skin. One of the few flying dinosaur species, this monster was able to fly quite aptly due to its 30 ft. (9.1 m) leathery wings. Combined with a long beak, the pteranodon held the middle ground between a reptile and a bird, although its beak was beset with razor-sharp teeth. It had a thin headcrest, and its skin contained small patches of downy feathers. Its large eyes were yellow-colored.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>When attacking in combat, pteranodons used the same technique as when they swooped down on water to catch the fish they fed on. Diving steeply, they liked to swoop down on their opponents both in aerial combat as when attacking opponents on the ground. If the victim of the pteranodon was too large, the animal would spear its enemy with its 4 ft (1.2 m) long beak.</p>
<h3>Training</h3>
<p>These powerful beasts could be used as a flying mount in aerial combat. To train one was hard work taking a skilled rider six weeks of training. The effort paid off with their ability to dive onto unsuspecting targets which made them and their riders a formidable opponent. Being strong creatures, they could also be employed to transport cargo since they could drag up to 4,500 lb (2.0 tons).</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>The jungles of Chult formed the habitat for most behemoths, including the pteranodon. Pteranodons were also common in the Old Empires, specially in Chessenta and Unther , and, after the Spellplague of 1385 DR , also in Tymanther .</p>
