<p>The Shrine of Swords was a shrine to Tempus located in the town of Archenbridge , in the Dalelands during the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Shrine was located in the center courtyard of the fortress of Swordpoint , which overlooked the River Arkhen and the town of Archenbridge.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>This slim building had the appearance of a black, open-faced, spired helm . The spire and front arch of the shrine were made of interwoven and hammered swords , shields and armors brought by worshipers as battle spoils. Those metallic decorations rusted regularly, causing the black paint to flake off the façade.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The shrine interior was fairly spartan, with simple furniture and simple sleeping cots for pilgrims .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Unlike other temples , the Shrine only offered its services to Archendale 's warriors. Adventurers, visitors and civilians looking religious assistance had to rely on other local temples, such as the Glory of the Morning or the Bounty of the Goddess .</p>
<p>In addition to healing the temple provided several services to the faithful, such as prayers to ask for the Lord of Battles' favor, or selling the occasional healing potion . As payment for those services, the Battle-Chaplain asked for services and sent people on quests, such as climbing a dangerous mountain with minimal equipment, or killing a wyvern and bringing its head to the temple as offering to Tempus.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>An iron golem was stored behind the shrine. Rumors abounded, as it was unclear whether the golem was in working condition, or just used as decoration.</p>
