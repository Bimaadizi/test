<h2>History</h2>
<p>The enchanted axe belonged to House Ormynd of Thay. In the Year of the Tightening Fist, 1074 DR , the people of Thay rose against oppressive Zulkirate and started a short but bloody civil war. Members of House Ormynd fled the Red Wizard –-ruled nation when they were betrayed. The family friend and bodyguard, Mauletar, picked up the axe and sacrificed his life, allowing the family to escape. Since then, the battle axe of Mauletar became a symbol of loyalty and devoted friendship. With time, many copies of the weapon were created and wielded to uphold the virtues of their namesake.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , several battle axes of Mauletar ended up on the Sword Coast . A member of the Band of Merry Fools wielded one such axe while in the city of Baldur's Gate . A drow slavemaster carried another battle axe of Mauletar while working for the enclave led by the Bhaalspawn named Sendai . Another axe ended up within the Planar Sphere of Lavok Corthala that crash-landed in Athkatla . Lastly. a weapon merchant Magda of the Black Pits had a copy of the battle axe of Mauletar available for sale.</p>
