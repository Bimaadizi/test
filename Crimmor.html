<p>Crimmor , also known as the City of Caravans or the Caravan Capital of Amn , was a fortified city and the focal point of practically all trades between the Sword Coast North and the Lands of Intrigue . The constant stream of travelers made it the most diverse Amnian city.</p>
<p>Built on the southern shore of the Alandor River , Crimmor was a city constantly bustling with life. A strong stink of ox dung filled the streets, courtesy of the unusual quantity of wagons roaming them. Caravaneers set camp outside of the city, filling the southern lands with tents and cattle.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<h3>Trade Routes</h3>
<p>Traveling towards the north was difficult, as the soft river bottom made it hard to build bridges. Travelers had to either pay a barge to get them on the other side, or take a long detour (usually towards the east).</p>
<h3>Weather</h3>
<p>On most days, a thin haze of dust hanged over the city, flung around by the beast's hoofs. On rare occasions a westbound wind cleaned the dust from the air, bringing with it the reeks of tanneries , paddocks and slaughterhouses.</p>
<p>Rain was a common occurrence in Crimmor, happening in short but severe downpours two to three times almost every morning. In addition mists caused by the river would cover the city every morning, until dispersed by the sun.</p>
<p>During the 14 th Century DR , the lands east of the city were plagued with dust storms. A local druid circle , the Flamenar , tried to reduce this issue by planting new trees on the surrounding hills.</p>
<p>During winter the region was covered by so much ice and snow that traveling with draft animals was impossible. During this time caravans stopped running, and the rare short and tedious trips were accomplished using humanoid -pulled sledges .</p>
<h3>Flora</h3>
<p>Inside the city no space was dedicated to parks or gardens. To find trees and grass, one had to step outside the fortified walls: they would first pass through the Keepclear , a grassy area as large as "the flight of a ballista - bolt fired from the wall towers" and used by townfolks for moots, walks and picnics. On the limit of the Keepclear near the Orc Road , visitors could find the first trees: a majority of duskwoods , as well as some felsuls . Those trees were a favorite playground of local children, and marked the beginning of the area where visiting caravans would set up their encampments. Lovers and paramours used to meet near those trees, but this tradition declined over time as caravan-riders enjoyed playing pranks on such couples.</p>
<p>Outside of the city gardens produced a variety of goods such as apples and pears . Some of those gardens were tended by the clergy of Chauntea .</p>
<h3>Fauna</h3>
<p>Most domesticated animals inside Crimmor were draft animals —mostly oxes and mules — as well as riding- horses and coach-horses. Those animals wore large brass badged stamped with the symbol of the city and graved with their owner's name. The badges were issued by the Thaeldorn and served to prove that the animal belonged to a tax-paying citizen, as visitors were forbidden to bring their own beasts of burden inside the city.</p>
<p>Crimmans kept few pets, as cats and dogs were banned from the city—except as caged cargoes. As a result mice and rats were plentiful, as were snakes and scavenger birds feeding on them. The locals hunted those pests using stones, poisons and drowning-traps whenever given a chance.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The city was ruled by the Thaeldorn , which was a name used to refer to both the building housing the Mayor, and the employees therein. Leading over them was the Alandor-Lord and Thaele of Crimmon , which people usually called the mayor . Corlyn Braen was the mayor circa 1374 DR . He was known to be fair-minded and well-meaning, wanting the best for the city and its inhabitants.</p>
<h3>Law & Order</h3>
<p>Crimmor had several protectionist laws related to the handling of commercial goods. A whole economy was built around those laws, allowing jobs such as dockhands, wagonmakers and drovers to thrive.</p>
<p>Multiple organizations worked together to keep the city and its inhabitants safe:</p>
<p>In addition, the authorities were known to hire mercenaries to increase the city defenses in case of necessity.</p>
<h3>Crime</h3>
<p>The Thaeldorn were known for their swift justice: an offender would usually be brought before a magistrate on the same day they were apprehended, or before noon if they were caught at night. Holding cells were built on the ground-floor of every tower alongside the city wall, and were used to incarcerate troublemakers awaiting their judgement. A more secure dungeon was built under the Thaeldorn, and was used for prisoners sentenced to long-term imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Heraldry</h3>
<p>Two different symbols were used to represent the city:</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Being a corner of the trading routes between Amn and the Sword Coast North , Crimmor had a vibrant economy revolving around trade goods and the people moving them. The city housed five major guilds representing dockhands and drovers, as well as other trades supporting them.</p>
<p>Thanks to the ban forbidding visitors to bring draft animals inside the city, Crimman teams of drovers performed dozen of trips daily between the docks and the Drover's Gate, moving wagons from barges to caravans and vice versa . Individual drovers used mules to deliver smaller shipments (e.g. chests, crates, kegs) to addresses within the city walls. It was common for such drovers to cry carry in the caravan-yards to advertise their services.</p>
<p>The most iconic wagonmaker of the city, Zan Zoldaftel , was known far and wide to produce the best carts one could buy. Over the years Old Zan took on many apprentices, on the condition that their own business would open in Crimmor as well. As a result, the city name was synonymous with top-of-the-line carts and wagons everywhere.</p>
<p>Crimmor counted many smithies, most of which were located in the southern Wheel Ward of the city. In addition to providing much needed much needed spare parts to the wagonmakers, the smiths also made the place a major processing center for the previous metals and gems mined in the nearby Cloud Peaks . The city was also a major jewelry -making center, although jewelry produced there was seen as inferior to the one produced in other places.</p>
<p>Finally, the city produced and exported a quantity of agricultural goods, such as apples, barley , corn , hops, malt , oats , pears, mild and sweet peppers, winter wheat , beers and ales . The latter, although of good quality, were disregarded as "common" by the Amnian elites. Candied Crimmor pears could be found as far as Westgate , 1 oz (28 g) being sold for 8 gp at Aurora's Emporium .</p>
<h3>Shopping</h3>
<p>It was said that in Crimmor anything could be bought, copied, repaired or altered. The numerous shops of the city were cluttered, noisy and always busy. Merchants opened shops from mistclear to dusk, but could handle restocking and deliveries all night long.</p>
<p>While items sold in shops had price tags, no laws required merchants to sell anything at the indicated price. It was customary for merchants in Amn to use an excessive price markup, making haggling a necessity.</p>
<p>Customers who broke items were expected to pay for the damage, and purchases were usually wrapped by merchants unless asked otherwise.</p>
<p>By decree of the Mayor, it was forbidden for customers to outbid each other for swifter service. The practice was still active in some shop, but done in secret.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<h3>Clubs and Taverns</h3>
<p>Festhalls, called Clubs , were an important aspect of the Crimman culture. Many townsfolk would meet in those dining halls to eat their main meal of the day, gossip, socialize, and conduct sideline business. This was also the place where they would go in order to hire new employees such as shop staff, guards, or adventurers.</p>
<p>In addition, Crimmor contained a variety of taverns where people would meet to drink cider and ale. Compared to clubs, taverns were noisy places offering few things to eat. They usually only served small snacks such as pickled, smoked oysters and fried cheese breads.</p>
<h3>Inns and Boarding Houses</h3>
<p>Visitors looking to spend the night in the city had two options to choose from: renting a room in one of the three inns of the city, or in one of its numerous boarding houses.</p>
<p>Inns were the pricier option, but offered full meals, larger houses, and various services such as laundry and bathing. Boarding houses were cheaper, but usually offered no more than basic amenities: a clean bed and chamber pots, a water basin, and door guards.</p>
<p>A night in the Pearl , the most expensive inn of the city, cost between 10 and 12 gp . In comparison, a night in a boarding house cost between 6 sp and 1 gp depending of the season.</p>
<p>Due to the constant cacophony of wagons roaming around Crimmor some visitors would prefer sleeping with the beasts in the paddocks outside the city, which were still quieter despite the lowing and neighing.</p>
<h3>Fashion</h3>
<p>Crimmans gave gaudy outfits less importance as a status symbol as other Amnians. They gave more importance to fine coaches, walking sticks, homes, luggage and tools.</p>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>The main worship in Crimmor was dedicated to Chauntea , Lliira , Milil and Sune . In addition, Waukeen played an important part in the life of all Amnians. The town also housed a shrine dedicated to many deities.</p>
<p>Deceased in Crimmor were celebrated by day long remembrance feasts held in their homes. Wealthy people were inhumated in the crypts of Silent Hill south-west of the city, reachable by following the Orc road . The bodies of regular citizens were washed and shaved, then taken east of the city on dedicated wagons to be cremated by priests —as for their hairs, they were sold for use in wigs and as stuffing.</p>
<h3>Prostitution</h3>
<p>While ladies of coin weren't proposing their services in the streets, the trade was still alive in the city. Hostesses of some clubs offered more than drinks, prostitutes looked for business in the Tymoran Trails inn, and a couple brothels masquerading as boarding houses offered room visits from "house girls" for an extra fee.</p>
<h3>Festivals and Holidays</h3>
<p>Wheelmoot was the only festival specific to the city of Crimmor. Held during winter, it was four consecutive days and nights of drinking and public debauchery.</p>
<h3>Waste Management</h3>
<p>Dedicated wagons were used to collect wastes, from broken items or household waste to the content of chamber pots. Those wagons moved slowly through town throughout the day, and the drovers signaled their arrival in front of each building using double-note fluted pipes. Once the wagons were full enough, their content was dumped in pits located three hills away south of town, along the Orc Road.</p>
<p>Citizen were charged for this waste removal service, paying 1 cp for each bucket dumped in the wagons. For the purpose of this service, any container that could be carried by one person unaided was considered as a bucket .</p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>Most of the city was built from stone, from the buildings to the cobbled streets.</p>
<p>The streets of the city had narrow but deep channels in their center, which were used to guide rainwater towards the Alandor river. They were often insufficient though, causing the streets to be permanently dirty and smelly from a melange of water and dung.</p>
<p>Buildings were tall and narrow, touching each other as to not waste any space. The first level of every building was a low-ceilinged cellar held together by massive stone supports, and had a characteristic "big step up" on its front threshold to keep water and dung at bay. The stone supports were necessary because the city was built upon hardened river ooze and uneven bedrock, causing the buildings to slowly sink down and lean in one direction or another. Those supports were regularly replaced or reinforced to keep the buildings straight and structurally stable.</p>
<p>While buildings were made from gray stone, they were stained brown until about 6 ft (1.8 m) high. Most buildings were four to six stories tall, and none were higher than the upthrusting spires of The Pearl . Building roofs were tilted and made of brown, green or blue tiles, and windows were usually very high and narrow, as wide as four men's palms across. Most houses used "window-poles" ending in hooks to slide up and down the vertically overlapping sliding glass panels that composed their windows.</p>
<p>Many building sported several small balconies, high enough to not be a nuisance to loaded wagons. The facades were decorated with carved "ardragons", mythical mock-dragons with impossibly thin and long bodies that curled around windows and other wall features. Signs were hung on building walls to give various indications, from advertising sales in shops to giving indications to wagon drovers.</p>
<h3>Water Supply</h3>
<p>Citizens knew better than drinking from the river, as its waters would cause people to feel sick for a while—especially visitors which weren't used to it.</p>
<p>Instead, the city was supplied with drinkable water through a midair pipe connecting to an abundant spring on the nearby Crytrapper Hill . The pipe ended on a wall-tower, where a series of pipes running along the city walls distributed it across the city. Almost every buildings were connected to this flow, and water was accessible through spigots, pumps and cisterns.</p>
<p>In addition some merchants sold "clearwater" from the Weeping Princess Pool , a nearby rainwater pool. This expensive product was sold in ornate flagons, and bought by snobbish folks.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The city was surrounded on the north by the Alandor River , and in all other directions by impressive gray granite walls. The walls were 40‒60 ft (12‒18 m) high, and guard towers equipped with ballistae were located on regular intervals along the periphery.</p>
<p>The Thaeldorn maintained several granaries around the city, which stored food supplies to be used in case of siege, famine, plague, or severe winters.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<h3>The lost lady</h3>
<p>In addition to being a major trade route, Crimmor was famous for being haunted. A ghost roamed the city streets, looking for a treasure and a long-lost lover. The ghost was said to be that of Esmaelae , a long-dead noblewoman of Tethyr , and was known to possess the living to further her searches. Some crimmans let Esmaelae possess them willingly, hoping to find her lost treasure along the way. Her victims were easy to recognize, as her ghostly face was slightly superimposed over theirs. Crimmans were extremely tolerant towards the antics of possessed victims, and sometimes followed them as a form of entertainment.</p>
<h3>Thayan murders</h3>
<p>Thayans were not welcomed in Crimmor, which didn't deter them from secretly trading items and potions infused with dark magic in the city. Circa 1370 DR several Red Wizards of Thay were found dead in the streets, their bodies left for citizens to see, with the words Thayans Stay Out carved in them. Those murders were wildly credited to the Shadow Thieves guild, and sparked numerous rumors amongst the citizens.</p>
<h3>Ophal and Thaeldorn rivalry</h3>
<p>According to rumors, Lady Zharnn Ophal planned to assassinate the Mayor and every last members of the Thaeldorn to replace them with loyal courtiers and bureaucrats. Details were fuzzy, with some pretending that the Shadow Thieves backed that attempt, while others insisted that they opposed her. According to the wildest rumors the Dragon Lady unleashed an amphibious, flying eel capable of traveling through water pipes to do the job.</p>
<h3>Snake soup</h3>
<p>According to Volothamp Geddarm , who severely disliked Crimmor, snake soup was a local delicacy. He reported that some dining houses were going so far as leaving intact snake heads in the broth to scare diners.</p>
<h2>Local expressions</h2>
<h3>Idioms</h3>
<h3>Slang</h3>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>Crimmor was divided into three city wards, demarcated by two major roads. The High Ride ran east-weast through the city and marked the southern end of the River Ward. The Wagonrun ran north-south and separated the Wheel Ward from the Purse Ward.</p>
<p>It was also the home of the Tymoran Trails , a popular inn known for its noisy and festive atmosphere.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<h3>Guilds</h3>
<p>Five guilds controlled the major trades in Crimmor: the Smiths, the Dockhands, the Leatherers, the Wagonmakers and the Wheelwrights. To reduce the risks of corruption, they had no guildmasters but elected small, short-term ruling councils instead.</p>
<p>It was said that the origin of this peculiar arrangement came from a debt high-ranking Shadow Thieves members owed to the Crytrapper family, who provided them alibis and protection when they were caught red-handed. The guild was so close to the Crytrappers that some of the family's secret warehouses were used to store contraband or guild members. The guild also ensured that no one would counterfeit the badges used on draft animals, by letting it known that every false badge would be worth one finger—severed from the user.</p>
<h3>Nobility</h3>
<p>Three major noble families held influence over Crimmor. They were collectively referred to as the grand families by the townsfolk. Other families were present in the city but deferred to the aforementioned grand families.</p>
