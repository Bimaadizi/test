<p>Almather's by the Water was a shop in Berdusk in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR that specialized in selling rare or unique weapons that were better suited for showmanship or worship than for actual battle.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The small shop sits on the Gollahaer , the shorter street that crossed the Clearspring . It was fairly close to the bookstore Ondraer's Fine Pages .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Almather's by the Water specialized in one-of-a-kind, rare, or unusual weaponry. Examples included cane-swords , gauntlets fitted with hidden dagger blades in the fingers, and barbed-wire whips . The shop also carried a wide array of trapped items, many set up to deliver lethal doses of poison , but the shop could not provide poisons by itself since the sale of venoms and toxins was banned within Berdusk.</p>
<p>Because of the nature of the store's wares, it was frequented by caravan merchants and professional killers.</p>
