<p>Prince Talisid ( pronounced : /ˈ t ɑː l ɛ s i d / TAL-eh-seed ), the Celestial Lion, was the most powerful and wise of all leonals , the protector of the Blessed Fields of Elysium , and the unofficial leader of all guardinals . In the World Tree cosmology , Talisid was considered to live in the House of Nature .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Talisid was a golden-maned leonal of muscular build and regal poise. At 9 feet (2.7 meters) in height, he was much taller than the average leonal, who stood closer to 6 feet (1.8 meters). His eyes were piercing and dark.</p>
<p>The "Leonal Prince" clothed himself in robes of elegant craftsmanship.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Talisid loved his natural realm with a great affection, developed over thousands of years. His hatred of evil was matched by this passionate love of nature. Of a balanced character, he thus could be compassionate or ruthless, as the circumstance required.</p>
<p>While considered a king among the guardinals, Talisid did not think of himself in this manner; he thought of himself rather as a servant of his people. He was proud of his accomplishments, but he was equally proud of those of his Companions , and his pride never interfered with his duties to uphold good in his realms.</p>
<p>The wisdom of Talisid was so well known, that even planetars and tulani have come to him for advice. His strategies were brilliant.</p>
<p>Talisid was known to absentmindedly stroke the beard on his chin frequently.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like all guardinals, Talisid could see far in dim light and had colorless vision in complete darkness . His body was magically resistant to harm from acid , cold , poison , and sound blasts and completely resistant to damage from electricity . He could not be turned into stone . Talisid could heal himself or others to a limited extent by touching them with his hands, and he could speak with nearly any sentient creature or animal by means of magic.</p>
<p>Like all leonals, Talisid had a powerful and supernatural roar that not only shook enemies with the force of the sound but affect them in a similar manner to a cleric 's holy word spell. He fought in a catlike manner, with biting, clawing, pouncing, and raking. A protective aura surrounded him at all times that defended him and allies near him against evil creatures. The aura surrounding Talisid additionally glowed with a nimbus of light. He shared several other inherent magical abilities common to leonals as well, such as the ability to cast fireballs from his fingertips.</p>
<p>As a celestial paragon , Talisid's powers were greater still. He could not be harmed by anything but the most powerful of mundane physical damage, unless the blows came from evil creatures using silvered weapons, and he was strongly resistant to spells from all but the most powerful spellcasters.</p>
<p>Finally, Talisid was a druid, with the full complement of druidic powers to the fullest extent available to mortals. He also knew an assortment of rare spells only known to the most benevolent of druids: affliction , rain of roses , silvered claws , and touch of adamantine .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Talisid had no weapons or armor, having little need of them on account of his powerful claws and advanced druidic magics.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Although he spent most of his time on Amoria , the uppermost layer of Elysium, Talisid wandered all four of that plane's layers freely, often in the form of a solitary lion . He guarded the Blessed Fields and the House of Nature from poachers and other foes of nature, tracking them silently. He had no permanent abode, instead relying on the hospitality of his many friends.</p>
<p>At times, like his Companions, Talisid would judge cases among the leonals or lead groups of them into battle against evil. Typically, he allowed the guardinals the freedom to live as they pleased, ruling by example, but when he spoke, his words were obeyed.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Talisid led the Five Companions much like the leader of an adventuring party, as a man leading his friends, not as a king leading his vassals. Talisid's bond of friendship to Sathia , Manath , Vhara , Kharash , and Bharrai was said to be stronger than the bonds of family. His friendship to the lupinal Kharash was the strongest of the Five. The two were so commonly seen in each other's company that Duke Kharash was sometimes called "Talisid's Shadow".</p>
<p>The powers of Elysium held great respect for the leonal prince.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>While Talisid was not the first Celestial Lion of Elysium, he was the longest guardinal serving in that role, having served for thousands of years and much longer than any of his Five Companions. Few even could recall the name of the Celestial Lion who came before him, and some even considered him a demigod .</p>
<p>Throughout history, many leonals have grown in power and sought to challenge Talisid to become the next Celestial Lion. Talisid would willingly pass on power and serve as an advisor to anyone who might best him, but he had humbled every such challenger in nonlethal combat.</p>
