<p>Trailstone was an Amnian village on the border with Tethyr in the 14 th century DR . It defected to the latter in 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>By 1370 DR , Trailstone was a modest village, with no great landmarks.</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>Southwest of the settled area, there was a haunted burial mound; on the southeastern downward slope, the mound had a refuge created by Maldiglas Turntower .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The place had a mayor, Jordy Droverson , as of 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Its defection to Tethyr had far-ranging consequences for the latter. Locally, however, most of the inhabitants were subsistence farmers, offering few services other than drink and a stop along the Tethir Road .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>As of 1370 DR , one of the troops garrisoned here was commanded by Timoth Eyesbright . Geiron Hawkwinter was also attached as a scribe.</p>
<p>The zone was also patrolled by the garrison of Chevangard .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The town rose around the Spulzeer Inn , which was raised by the Spulzeer family in 1316 DR . Another inn was built after a fire in 1326 DR ; a third inn, the New Spulzeer Inn , was built in 1348 DR by Rafe Spulzeer . Per some sources, that was done as part of an agreement between the Council of Six and the master of Castle Spulzeer , Chardath Spulzeer . At first, Trailstone was seen as a mere watering hole and rest stop, but it gained notoriety through its defection.</p>
<p>In Ches of 1370 DR , the communities of Trailstone and Riatavin announced their intention to defect from Amn and join Tethyr: the shocked Tethyrian court at Darromar sent a representative from the local counts. The response from Amn's Council of Six was brusque enough that it prompted Queen Zaranda Star of Tethyr to officially recognize both settlements as under the protection of Tethyr; troops were sent late in the month to reinforce the location, and the Order of the Blue Boar was conscripted to reinforce Spellshire .</p>
<p>The two communities defecting cited their economic and political treatment as the reason for their rebellion; Maztican trade had not benefited them at all, as all wealth and influence went to northern, southern, and western Amn. By the end of the second tenday of Tarsakh , Amnian officials had officially resigned themselves to the loss.</p>
<p>By Kythorn , more than half of the Shadow Thieves operatives in the city were found dead. The troops remained garrisoned past Eleint of that year, though Tethyr was on a war footing elsewhere. Because of the situation, while the location remained a small watering hole, it had swelled to nearly twice its size with soldiers.</p>
<p>The Vinson family retreated to its holdings in Trailstone after the death of Kirsoph Vinson .</p>
