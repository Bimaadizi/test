<p>The Grotto of Sacred Thoughts rested at the heart of the Undervaults of Ilsensine in the mind flayer city of Oryndoll .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The temple was in a vast natural cavern, with a gigantic idol at the center that was 60 feet (18 meters) in diameter. The idol was made of petrified brains and was carved to form the shape of a giant elder brain . There were thirty-six tentacles that came out of the statueâ€“all of which dug into the floor and then came out of the floor again to form columns along the edge of the cavern. At the top of the effigy rested the Encephalithid , which lived alongside Oryndoll's tadpoles inside the Great Pool.</p>
<p>The Great Pool was the spiritual, social, and governmental heart of the city. The Venerators in Oryndoll also organized themselves out of this temple and were responsible for maintaining the Shrines of the Great Brain .</p>
