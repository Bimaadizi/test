<p>The Temple of Gargauth was a place of worship dedicated to the cruel god Gargauth in Bezantur , Thay .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple was located in northeastern Bezantur, the so-called "City of a Thousand Temples". It abutted the House of Iyachtu Xvim to its south.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Despite Gargauth being openly worshiped across Thay, his followers in Bezantur were treated with cautious superstition, owing to the fact that their cruel god was known to kill and devour his worshipers. It was believed that he had personally visited the Temple to slaughter members of its congregation, and despite this they were fervent in their devotion.</p>
<p>The Temple's rituals were carried out at midnight. Participants wore Gargauth's symbol openly and proudly on their chests, and were led in such ceremonies by a high priest .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , Gargauth was not a popular god in Bezantur, although his few followers were zealous. The high priest at the time was Marr , who spread rumors that Gargauth visited the temple to feast on his supplicants. However, many doubted that this was true, and presumed that the priest had invented these tales to conceal accidental deaths among his flock.</p>
