<p>A chu-ko-nu was a repeating light crossbow unique to the continent of Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A chu-ko-nu possessed the ability to discharge multiple bolts before requiring a reload. Positioned on top was a magazine capable of accommodating up to ten quarrels. The cocking and reloading mechanism involved a single lever that was pushed forward and then pulled back, enabling a faster rate of fire compared to conventional crossbows. In a moment, it was possible to reload up to two quarrels into the magazine. Thus, a total of five rounds was necessary to fully reload the chu-ko-nu. However, it was not feasible to fire and reload quickly. The drawback was this weapon was heavier than a regular crossbow and offered a shorter range.</p>
