<p>Deepchill was a sentient dwarven frostbrand broadsword that came into the possession of Vinjarek the Mound King sometime before the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The blade reflected light as if it were made of ice. Its original scabbard was made of fine leather and was inset with three matched gemstones , each of which was worth between 55 and 68 gold pieces .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>As a dwarven weapon, Deepchill was only happy when underground, and moreso if its owner was a dwarf. It was intelligent and could speak Dwarvish as well as the lawful neutral alignment language , although its preference was always for using Dwarvish. It despised anyone with whom it was unable to speak.</p>
<p>Deepchill was referred to both as "it" and as "he/him".</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The sword had an exceptionally powerful magic edge and was twice as mighty when fighting wielders of fire . It also had the automatic ability to detect secret doors , detect sloping passages , and detect elevator/shifting rooms/walls , although the blade had to be within 10 feet (3 meters) or closer for these powers to function.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In ancient times, Deepchill belonged to a dwarven king in the North . Sometime before the founding of Silverymoon , this owner was slain by a human bandit king belonging to the Chieftains in Gold , who claimed the sword and was subsequently buried with it in the Tombs of Deckon Thar .</p>
<p>The blade was later found and claimed by the great wight Vinjarek, who declared himself the Mound King of the Tombs of Deckon Thar. While Deepchill was Vinjarek's most prized possession, the sword disliked its lawful evil owner, who was unable to understand or speak with it. However, this did not stop the Mound King from gaining complete mastery over Deepchill .</p>
<p>Over the centuries that followed, Deepchill 's fine scabbard rotted away, leaving only the gems that had once adorned it.</p>
