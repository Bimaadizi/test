<p>A pot of awakening was a magical pot that could nurture a plant into sentience.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A pot of awakening looked like a regular clay pot and weighed 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms). If an ordinary shrub was planted in this pot and left to grow for at least 30 days, the shrub was transformed into an awakened shrub . The awakened shrub woke and left the pot, destroying it in the process as its roots broke through. The awakened shrub was friendly towards the individual who planted it.</p>
