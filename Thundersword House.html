<p>Thundersword House was the castle and the seat of power of the noble Thundersword family of Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Thundersword family was the third major noble family in the city of Immersea , and the castle they erected was the newest and largest among their peers: the families of Wyvernspur , and Cormaeril . Unlike them, however, Thundersword House was built outside the borders of Immersea, to the southwest of the Wyvernspurs' Redstone Castle and their farmlands. Thundersword House stood on a small wooded knoll in its own small valley.</p>
