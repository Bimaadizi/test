<p>Giant caterpillars were a species of somewhat common giant insects that inhabited the Sword Coast North .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Similarly to mundane caterpillars, the giant varieties had colorful hides, from bright greens and browns to striking blacks. Some powerful varieties were known to have large venomous spikes on their bodies and deadly venomous pincers.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Giant caterpillars inhabited the Underdark and caves near Mantol-Derith , subterranean areas near farmlands and the town of Triboar , the sewers of Waterdeep , mines deep underneath Termalaine , under the Sunblight citadel, the Wyrmheart Mine in Chult , and in the depths of Feywild .</p>
<p>Giant caterpillars dwelt in caverns, feeding on fungus . They responded with aggression if their foraging grounds were disturbed. The larger species of giant spiked caterpillars could trigger a feeding frenzy among the smaller kin through pheromone discharge.</p>
<p>Giant caterpillars produced silk , which was weaved into exceptionally strong ropes , making them targets for industrious adventurers of Waterdeep . Their poison sacs were also harvested to be used as magic ritual ingredients.</p>
