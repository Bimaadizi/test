On the way, they killed or enslaved many dwarves , though Bronwyn Caradoon and Ebenezer Stoneshaft would later retake Thornhold. Thanks to the corrupt Sir Gareth of the Knights of Samular , Dag Zoreth came close to possessing both Kezefbane and the rings of Samular , only to be foiled by Bronwyn.</p>
