<p>Ubtao's Jaws was a large, south-facing gate in the exterior walls of Port Nyanzaru in Chult . It connected the interior Harbor Ward and Market Ward to the exterior slum district of Malar's Throat .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The gate sat in the walls of south-central Port Nyanzaru at the mouth of the ravine that formed Malar's Throat. This placement meant that during rains, water runoff down the ravine would pass through the gate to empty into the harbor and the Bay of Chult beyond.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Whenever Malar's Throat came under attack from jungle monsters or undead , mercenaries on the payroll of the merchant princes would keep them out of the city. However, they would not go out of the gate to defend Malar's Throat.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , the waters that flowed through Ubtao's Jaws during heavy rains were known to carry along small unattended items, dead animals, and the occasional person.</p>
<p>The area just outside the gate was known to be a place where beggars would cluster.</p>
