<p>Nassar was a priest of Kossuth , the frontman of the Heart of Bane who utilized flames and pyrotechnics in his shows, and a part of the Bard's Guild of Ravens Bluff in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By Uktar of the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Nassar found his calling as a devote cleric of Kossuth, the Tyrant Among Fire and the single of a bardic band. His singing was often described as wailing on the pages of the Ravens Bluff Trumpeter broadsheet . Nassar assembled like-minded performers: Everett Taber who played drums of panic , Firmal with his illithid bagpipes , Vanduhar Gerenstalt Eisnerâ€Ž and his Illmataran organ of pain , and Havoc Sen Thornclaw with his ax of deafening and destruction . It was Nassar's call to pick a controversial name for the band. The Heart of Bane band was named after the infamous relic of the same name. Nassar believed that such a grand name was sure to attract a great number of listeners. In Uktar, the Bard's Guild plastered the city with posters that advertised that the Heart of Bane would be making an appearance at a performance aimed at helping the city's morale. Coincidentally, the previous month's performance was led by another follower of Kossuth.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the ill-conceived advertisement attracted the attention of a band of tanar'ri led by a marilith , as the planar beings were attracted to the relic's dark magic , plaguing the city at the time. The ensuing slaughter took the lives of a dozen innocents, and the Bard's Guild was lit aflame, with the guild being severely damaged. The demonic attack was ended by a Golden Rooster Patrol led by Sir Kirth Sonath-Pann . In the fallout of the performance, Nassar and his band went into hiding, leaving only a spokesperson to proclaim their innocence. The proceedings from the show were never paid to Nassar's group as the Bard's Guild claimed that the box office was ransacked by a nabassu .</p>
