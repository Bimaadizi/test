<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Mavnar was the elected mayor of the city. Along with his small council, he was responsible for the daily governing of Almorel. Though Almorel was spared from an assault from the Tuigan Horde during the great wars, Mavnar believe it prudent to replace Almorel's wooden walls with solid stone to dissuade future aggression from the belligerent nomads.
