<p>The Shaaran zebra was a regional variety of zebra that roamed the plains of the Shaar and Eastern Shaar , in south and southeastern Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>The striped steeds of the Shaar were difficult to separate from their herd. Unlike other breeds of horses, zebras lived in a social structure that resembled a harem, with one polygamous male living among a group of many females.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The zebras were short, but light equine with heavy heads and full, thick manes. Their most unique characteristic was the distinct, vertical black and white striping of their coats.</p>
<p>Rather than a typical neigh or whinny common among other equines, zebras had a distinctive "bark", unique to their breed.</p>
