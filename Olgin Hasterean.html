<p>Olgin Hasterean was the oni mage leader of a tribe of noxious ogres , trolls , and orcs who dwelt within Undermountain circa 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Olgin was a brutish giant of an ogre whose rugged exterior hid cunning intelligence. He was a powerful spellcaster and was accompanied by summoned dire bears at all times.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The oni wore a pair of enchanted dragon slippers and held many treasures within his makeshift throne room, including such items as valuable rogue stones and a powerful harp of haunting .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Halaster Blackcloak , the Mad Mage of Undermountain, brought Olgin and many other monstrous humanoids into his underground domain. The ogre mage quickly rose to power due to his powerful magics. After Halaster's disappearance and Undermountain becoming taken over by the drow , Olgin led his tribe of ogres against harpies and fey led by the so-called Fairy Queen . When Drogan Droganson's pupil entered the dungeon in search of the drow mastermind behind the recent associations in Waterdeep , the hero came head to head with Olgin and his Fairy Queen foe; however, it was unknown if the oni survived the meeting. One thing was known â€“ if Olgin Hasterean was defeated, he was eager to save his life through negotiations and opening the passage to Undermountain's lower level.</p>
