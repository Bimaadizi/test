<p>The Temple of Silvanus was a place of worship in Loudwater in the late 15 th century DR that was sacred to Silvanus , the god of nature.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It was on the eastern edge of town and had a small hedge that served to separate it from the other buildings around it.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The temple walls towered over the surrounding town, and a spire rose a full 100 feet (30 meters) above the ground. Vines wound up the sides of the building. A large archway marked the main entrance, above which was Silvanus's symbol—an oak leaf—which glowed brightly with green light.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>One massive room dominated the inside of the temple, which contained its own grassy hill atop which a circle of trees grew. The walls and ceiling were painted to look like the sky, and a gentle breeze eternally blew through the room, which gave it a calm and quiet ambiance.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The temple was holy ground of Silvanus, although followers of all peaceful faiths were welcomed. The temple offered healing and guidance to visitors.</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the temple was headed by Brother Griffon , who could be found there at dawn and dusk each day.</p>
