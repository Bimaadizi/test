<p>Greater shadowraths , which were also called abysskin , were a powerful form of undead that had a connection with the dangerous artifact known as the Crown of Horns .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A greater shadowrath appeared as they did when they were alive with the exception of their lack of eyes, skeleton, and internal organs. These missing parts were replaced with pure negative energy that was somewhat concealed by the clothing or armor worn at the time of their death. The crackling black negative energy was visible through the creature's eyes, open mouth, and any wounds.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>These creatures retained the intelligence they possessed in life.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Any magical or psionic abilities acquired by a lesser shadowrath during their life were lost upon their transformation. The touch of a greater shadowrath caused intense pain in the target as well as draining a portion of their lifeforce. Any victim drained of their entire lifeforce suffered an irreversible death.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>These creatures often acted as bodyguards for whoever wore the Crown of Horns . They followed any commands given by the Crown bearer, and often led groups of lesser shadowraths . If left uncontrolled for some reason, a greater shadowrath sought to destroy spellcasters or followers of Mystra .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Greater shadowraths were created by the "Myrkul's Hand" power of the Crown of Horns .</p>
