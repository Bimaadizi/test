<p>Ikizawa was one of the many isolated villages of the Fochu Peninsula in Wa . Its people were primarily weavers.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Perhaps because they had suffered much in raids from yellow-robed attackers sent by Za-Jikku , the people of Sukyo were especially suspicious of strangers, fleeing in abject terror at the sight of visitors.</p>
<p>Most of the structures within the village were simple peasant shacks known as minka , built from wood with latticed walls and straw-thatched roofs. Apart from these poor residences were small barns, warehouses, and shops. The shoya's own minka was in ruins from the raids.</p>
<p>The hamlet had a population of about 175 individuals after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR) .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Ikizawa was located in the foothills south of the Jufosu Range . A trail led north into the mountains, and another wended south to the village of Chiroi .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Villages in Wa were run by an administrator known as a shoya , typically a minor samurai . Ikizawa's shoya after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), however, was a wu jen named Tamura Umakai .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Like the other tiny settlements of the region, Ikizawa had little contact with the other villages, much less with the rest of Kara-Tur or regions beyond. The people were weavers, but there is no evidence that they actively traded their goods with other settlements.</p>
<p>The cost to spend the night in one of the small minkas was 2 fen . The village did not produce anything more expensive than 1 yuan to sell.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>About 18 citizens of Ikizawa served in its militia. These persons were only armed with simple clubs or spears .</p>
<h2>Religion</h2>
<p>Unlike the other settlements in the region, the people of Ikizawa were not particularly religious.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed coiled dragon Za-Jikku began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical butterflies, the breath of which would create yun ch'i , the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever. The village of Ikizawa suffered especially severely from Za-Jikku's raids, being attacked twice in a six month period. The attacks resulted in the deaths of dozens of villagers and sent the wu jen shoya Umakai into hiding.</p>
