<p>Moonsilver Inn was one of the first structures built along the River Rauvin where the city of Silverymoon would later rise.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Avatars of Lurue and Mielikki first met each other where the inn and town would later be constructed. When the pair returned to the same spot centuries later, disguised as a ranger and her steed, they were pleased to see the humans had not plundered the nearby forest for resources. They blessed the inn by promising safety to all who kept either of the goddesses in their heart.</p>
