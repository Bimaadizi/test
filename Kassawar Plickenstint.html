<p>Kassawar Plickenstint was the primary deep gnome delegate in Mantol-Derith in 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kassawar was the representative of Blingdenstone in the merchant outpost of Mantol-Derith. After 1371 DR , he was chosen as the representative of Luruar , but the deep gnomes there produced a smaller portion of goods than before. So Kassawar had little to do and spent a lot of his time just staring at nothing.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Kassawar greatly suffered for the loss of his home city and spent most of his time in mourning.</p>
