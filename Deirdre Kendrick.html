<h2>History</h2>
<p>Deirdre was the second daughter of King Tristan and Queen Robyn Kendrick, born barely a year after her sister Alicia. As they grew up, Deirdre was often openly hostile to her sister, apparently already suffering from doubt and inadequacy that she channeled into rage. She was taught by Keane, but he stopped when he understood the void in her heart.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR , Sinioth seduced her. At first, Talos used Deidre in a positive fashion, sending her to stop the Ityak-Ortheel and to save her father from sahuagin . However, afterward, Deidre became a complete pawn of Talos and the storm god used her to start a war to conquer the isles. In the end, Deidre was killed by her sister Alicia.</p>
