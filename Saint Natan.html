<p>Prince Natan of the House of Ithal-Strohm-Bormul was a paladin of Ilmater who became a saint of that faith for his heroic sacrifice.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Natan was the third son of Prince Coram of Tethyr , but he died before his father would become king. He was the father of future kings Coram II and Alemander I , as well as three daughters.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Keening Gale, 1050 DR , the paladin-prince was traveling with his family as part of a caravan when they were all attacked by three wereboars . Natan died saving his family, which included his newborn son Coram, and the strangers of the caravan. As his dying wish, he asked that a temple to Ilmater be built in his memory.</p>
<p>Within a few months, the Church of Ilmater made Prince Natan a saint, and they constructed a garrison and temple as he had requested. In addition, the site became an orphanage with a school and a monastery, being called the Monastery of St. Natan .</p>
<p>St. Natan's body was buried in one of the corners of the courtyard of the monastery, and his spirit continued to watch over the worshipers of Ilmater there.</p>
