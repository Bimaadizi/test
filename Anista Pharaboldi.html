<p>Anista Pharaboldi was the matriarch of the noble House Pharaboldi of Arrabar before her death in 1373 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Pharaboldi matriarch had a haughty high-pitched voice.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Anista was a proud ruler of the Pharaboldi estate and its many grand vegetation-filled chambers, gardens, and a collection of noble steeds .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Anista Pharaboldi had a husband and three children, Denrick , the youngest of the three; Lobra Pharaboldi , who was wed to Falagh Mestel , and the oldest son – Jerephin Pharaboldi .</p>
<p>Anista Pharaboldi represented her family within a sneak coin cabal of several powerful merchant families of Arrabar who attempted to claim power via money and profiteering from an orchestrated war. The organization included Grozier Talricci of House Talricci , his family wizard Bartimus , Dregaul Matrell of House Matrell , as well as the corrupt Grand Trabbar Lavant of the Temple of Waukeen .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of the Helm, 1362 DR , Anista Pharaboldi secured courtship between her boarish son Denrick Pharaboldi and a noble of the House Matrell, Emriana Matrell , to the young woman's displeasure. Emriana was bound by tradition to pay social visits to the House Pharaboldi, accompanied by her mother and grandmother. When her son Denrick started bedding a Pharaboldi maid named Jithelle Skolotti and got her pregnant, Anista used her membership within a cabal of rich and powerful of Arrabar to have the maid murdered. Jithelle was cut down by henchmen of the cabal under the guise of the Municipal Guard of Arrabar , who placed a marking on her forehead that indicated her as a wizard . As per the strict anti-arcane laws of Chondath, any person who falsely placed such a mark on their face was sentenced to death. To ensure that Jithelle would not speak after death, her body was promptly cremated after the clerics of the Church of Waukeen , claimed that the maid was afflicted with a magical plague.</p>
<p>Anista Pharaboldi's life was ended on Tarsakh 13 , 1373 DR , by her power-hungry son's dagger plunged into the matriarch's chest.</p>
<p>Anista Pharaboldi's legacy became obvious during the joint funeral of the matriarch and her murderous son Denrick who met justice and payment by Beshaba 's ill luck, after falling off the balcony of the Matrell estate. The funeral took place on Tarsakh 16 and among the attendees were the members of Anista's cabal. The conspirators convinced Lobra Pharaboldi, the estate's new head, that Vambran Matrell was the villain solely responsible for the House Pharaboldi's tragedy. Lobra tasked her husband – Falagh Mestel, to heal the revenge plot while the cabal's plans to instigate a war with Hlath and Reth continued their course.</p>
