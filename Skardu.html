<p>Skarou was the capital city of the nation of Khazari .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sitting where the Jumpa and Shyok Muren rivers met , the city of Skarou was well fortified due to the divided nature of the nation's politics. Though the capital of the nation, Skarou was considered run-down and ramshackle for its size, due to most of its power having been taken by the nobles of the nation.</p>
<p>Inside the city was the Seven-Tiered Palace , from which the royalty of Khazari ruled, the Monastery of the Flowing Water , and the largest monastery of the Red Mountain sect . There was also a small monastery of the Yellow Mountain sect inside the city, resulting in some feuding between the two groups.</p>
<p>Skarou was one of the five great cities of Khazari legend, along with Manass , Taghla , Barkhul and Alashan .</p>
