<p>The Bleeding Citadel was a holy sanctuary that was found on the plane of Avernus in the Nine Hells .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The citadel sat atop and within the massive mound of unidentifiable mass of seemingly living tissue referred to as the Scab . Great chains of infernal iron bound the citadel to the ground surrounding the living hill.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The alabaster temple was partially covered by the disgusting mass of the Scab, to the point where little more than its domed roof was still visible. Its walls were decorated with stained-glass windows depicting angelic figures, that could bolster the vitality of any goodly creature that touched it.</p>
<p>The citadel's absorption by the Scab was an ongoing process, believed by some to fully envelop it by some point. The temple's massive brass doors had been wholly enveloped within the depths of the Scab tissue. Untarnished by the unholy mass, they bore the likeness of the blind solar Zariel and an inscription written in Celestial .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The interior of the citadel featured a path of stone pillars that led to a dais inscribed with Celestial runes , atop which rested the Sword of Zariel .</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>By some unknown means, a bright and restorative sunlight shone through the glass windows of the temple, regardless of the surrounding landscape. It removed grit and grime from possessions and offered a sense of rejuvenation to those within.</p>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The citadel was created with one singular motivation, to house and keep safe the Sword of Zariel so that it could not be claimed by the forces of evil .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Bleeding Citadel was formed after the events of The Ride, when the Zariel led the Hellriders of Elturel into a losing battle in Avernus, offering her services to Asmodeus , and becoming an archdevil herself. Yael , Zariel's most loyal soldier, and Lulu , her golden mastadon mount took Zariel's sword and made sacrifices of themselves to create a sanctuary for its safekeeping. Yael gave up her life and Lulu sacrificed both her memories and magical powers.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The only known inhabitant of the Bleeding Citadel was the ghost of Yael, Zariel's most loyal follower.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>It was believed that if a worthy individual attuned themself to the sword of Zariel and removed it from its dais the entire citadel would be destroyed in an explosion of light.</p>
