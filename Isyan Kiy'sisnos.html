<p>Isyan Kiy'sisnos was a moon elf bladesinger of the city of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . She was a Scion of the Green Regent and the Gauntlet of the Western Marches , with the duty of commanding the Loudwater Guard and defending Loudwater's territory to the west, and as such was based at High Lord's Hall and in the Western Tower .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Isyan was a minor noble of one of Loudwater's ancient elven houses. A member of the Loudwater Guard, Isyan had dealings with the bandits known as the Half-Elven Renegades for many years and knew well of them.</p>
<p>At the ceremony for the choosing of the Green Regent on Shieldmeet of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Isyan was among the volunteers and was accepted as a Scion.</p>
<p>Isyan later replaced the former Gauntlet of the Western Marches, Jaida Zerezeal , in Eleasis / Eleint of that year. At only around 140 years in age, she was surprisingly young for such a role. Isyan soon after began an inspection of the city's defenses, such as by checking for rot in the wooden palisade and for erosion of the earthen embankment.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Although a moon elf by blood, Isyan was a lot like a sun elf in nature. He was aloof, cool, and haughty; impeccable in manner; and dedicated to duty. This included championing Mielikki as a Scion of the Green Regent, which was a role she took seriously even while being a faithful follower of Corellon Larethian .</p>
<p>Isyan had little patience for fools and spoke his mind freely and directly, being unafraid to voice criticisms and suspicions in public. The only friendliness shown to strangers was to fellow Scions. While she did not like orcs , after the Gray Migrations and the High Lord's Decree of Reception , she gradually came to accept the High Forest orcs ' presence in Loudwater and their right to exist, though he remained uncomfortable with them as allies and neighbors.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Isyan was strikingly beautiful, with an athletic and feminine figure, and moved with precision and balance reminiscent of a dancer, or rather, a capable warrior. Isyan had dark hair, grown long and bound in the back with fine silver cords. While a Scion of the Green Regent, Isyan bore the holy symbol of Mielikki upon her brow, glowing emerald.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Isyan wore a well-fitted suit of elven chain .</p>
