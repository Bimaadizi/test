<p>The Marsember Marsh was an area of marshland that stretched along the northern shore of the Dragonmere for several miles, occupying the mouth of the Starwater River . It was inhabited by lizardfolk , but when a war broke out, most were slain, and the area was taken over by will-o'-wisps and other creatures. It eventually became the site of the city of Marsember in Cormyr .</p>
