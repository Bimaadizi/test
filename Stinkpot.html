<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Stinkpots consisted of a ceramic clay vessel filled with a mix of noxious substances, typically either burning sulfur or quicklime . Upon shattering, the vessel unleashed a noxious cloud that sickened everyone within 10​ to ​20 feet (3​ to ​6.1 meters), causing nausea, the eyes to water, coughing and choking. This cloud of vapor would naturally disperse.</p>
