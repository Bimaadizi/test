<p>A Libram of Ineffable Damnation was a tome of great value to arcane spellcasters who venerated evil.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>To make use of the work, an evil wizard needed to spend a week cloistered and undisturbed, perusing the tome. Before 1372 DR , the book would teach them approximately half of what they needed to take their skills to the next level; after 1372 DR , these books instead increased the natural qualities of the magician that governed their spellcasting. In either case, the book disappeared after use, and no mage could gain the benefit of such a tome again.</p>
<p>Arcane casters whose alignment was rejected by the book suffered severe damage, were left unconscious for 50-200 minutes, commensurate to the damage taken, and needed an atonement spell cast in order to continue their studies before 1372 DR . After 1372 DR , rather than physical damage, their basic health was undermined with no period of unconsciousness; they still needed the atonement spell to continue advancing in their studies. Anyone not an arcane spellcaster in the first place who read the tome was at risk of insanity .</p>
