<p>Nylerian was a fang dragon that laired in the Spiderhaunt Wood during the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1374 DR , the time of the Elven Crusade , Nylerian set up a new lair in a cave network in the Spiderhaunt Wood, dominating a group of ettercaps and demanding meals from them. Rather than feed their own to their new master, the ettercaps began actively raiding the nearby areas for captives instead. They caught a number of orcs and elves , many of whom were traveling the roads nearby due to the reclamation of Myth Drannor . Sergeant Thiralen Farstep of the Cormanthor Elves noticed the missing elves, and sent a team to investigate the Spiderhaunt Wood, where they discovered the caves. After fighting through the ettercaps and other creatures, the lazy fang dragon was eventually found and slain.</p>
