<p>Cloning was the process of creating an exact duplicate of a living being, by replicating both their body and mind. There were several known ways of creating clones , also referred to as husks , each of which produced slightly different results.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Clones differed in appearance, longevity, and consciousness, depending on the means in which they were created. One common characteristic among the various varieties of clones, was that they all appeared nearly identical to the person of which they were a copy.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The process of cloning was often used to preserve the consciousness and essence―in effect the very soul ―of the recently deceased, specifically in cases where they could not be resurrected . Some well-funded adventurers were known to commission clones as a form "insurance" in the case of an unexpected and horrific death accompanied by dismemberment or loss of their corpse.</p>
<p>Wealthy and vain individuals sometimes used clones to retain their youthful appearance for years on end. They commissioned powerful wizards to create clones that aged at a slower rate that natural-born individuals.</p>
<p>While baelnorns did not make use of phylacteries as other liches , some were known to employ the use of clones.</p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>The process of cloning could profoundly affect the psyche of both the target individual as well as the duplicate that was created. It was said that if both a living person and their clone existed at the same time, one or each individual would be afflicted with madness . More often than not the duplicate succumbed to this mental deterioration.</p>
<p>Some methods of cloning did not allow for the transferal of spellcasting abilities. Clones created by those means were readily more identifiable as duplicates, whenever it became apparent they could not wield magical powers as expected.</p>
<p>Certain powerful spells that compelled individuals to action—such as Geas/Quest ―automatically transferred from a person to their clone.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<h3>Magic</h3>
<p>There were several known ways to create a clone of a living person. The most well known means were two distinctly different necromancy spells, clone and stasis clone . The spell clone allowed a spellcaster to create a perfect copy of an individual, in body and mind, often to be used as a vessel for their consciousness in the case of their death. It could take up to four to eight months for a clone made in this way to fully mature.</p>
<p>Stasis clone on worked in similar manner, with two key differences: the created clone remained preserved in a state of non-decay, so long as its progenitor remained alive, and the clone remained unaware of its origin, nor the existence of whom it duplicated.</p>
<p>There also existed a means to create clones using an ancient form of blood magic developed by the creator races . This process involved the blood of an individual, combined with necromantic magic, fed into a gruesome machine that spawned the clone. These clones did not exhibit the full range of personality as others, possessed no free will for much of their existence, and primarily sought only to serve their creator. The lifespans of these 'husk clones' lasted only months, thought it was believed that could be extended to years or even decades.</p>
<p>The shadovar archmage Telamont Tanthul was said to have developed a "multiple clone" spell that could grow numerous clones from a single appendage or even an object taken from an individual.</p>
<p>The Ice Queen Iyraclea had the ability to create a clone out of living ice, known as an iceborn .</p>
<h3>Other</h3>
<p>In the empire of Netheril , the arcanist Halavar developed a machine called a universal pantrograph that duplicated any item placed within, including organic material. This machine facilitated a more-perfect means of cloning, copying an individual and their personality with exacting accuracy. The device was unfortunately lost to the ages.</p>
<p>Centuries later, powerful individuals developed less more rudimentary means of non-magical cloning, using human -sized tanks filled with unidentified chemicals. The clones produced by these methods unfortunately shared the same limited consciousness and insanity as suffered by those created with magical spells. The alchemist Thessalar of the Temple of Moloch , and Jon Irenicus of Athkatla , both experimented with this method of cloning.</p>
<p>The Spire of Iriolarthas , which broke off from the Netherese enclave of Ythryn , house a rune -inscribed chamber that could transform illusory creatures into living beings. It was believed this room could transform simulacrums into living clones.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Most societies across the Realms enacted laws that granted clones inheritance of their progenitor's estate. They were given full legal benefits as were granted to any other living citizen.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Long before the formation of Faerûn and other continents, during the Days of Thunder era, the ancient sarrukh experimented with dark, necromantic magic that allowed them to create 'blood copies' living beings. This form of cloning required only the blood of a living, sentient creature.</p>
<p>During the time of ancient Netheril, an ally of the archmage Chantonay created a clone spell-effect in the prison of Eileanar enclave. This echo effect created a duplicate of any person that came into contact with the spell ward . Any clones created in this way had an expected life of several months, and had a significantly lower chance of succumbing to clone-induced insanity.</p>
<p>In the years leading up to the mid–to–late 14 th century DR, Manshoon of the Zhentarim had focused much of his time and resources in perfecting the art of cloning. When Manshoon was slain his former allies Fzoul Chembryl and Lord Orgauth in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , about a dozen or so clones the Zhent leader awakened at once and immediately attacked his murderers. Malevolent archmages appeared across the Realms―in Cormyr , the Dalelands , Darkhold and beyond―each convinced they were the "real" Manshoon, and absolutely determined to kill any other fakes on sight. The subsequent conflicts that arose came to be known as the Manshoon Wars . After most of the clones were slain, it was believed that only three managed to survive the whole ordeal.</p>
<p>Decades later, sometime before the Year of Splendors Burning, 1469 DR , the Tethyrian noblewoman Evonne Linden discovered secrets related to sarrukh cloning techniques in the jungles of Chult . She used the technology to transfer her spirit into the body of her daughter Ysabel . Unlike other clones that lasted only a few months, Evonne managed to live as her daughter for at least a decade's time.</p>
<p>During the late 15 th century DR, the hags of the Sewn Sisters coven in the Tomb of the Nine Gods were known to create degraded clones of adventurers that ventured within the terrifying dungeon. Unlike other clones, these duplicates did not exactly resemble the adventurers and shared with them a mental link that could be exploited by their dark fey creators.</p>
