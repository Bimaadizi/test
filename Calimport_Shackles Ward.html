<p>Shackles Ward was one of the wards of the city of Calimport .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Shackles Ward was the poorest ward of the city, inhabited primarily by slaves and slavers. It was the most southwestern ward of the city and lay outside the city wall.</p>
<p>The drudach walls within the ward were strangely nonexistent, the stones having been scavenged over the years for other uses.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The fourth son of Syl-Pasha Ralan el Pesarkhal , Sultan Harun el Pesarkhal had official control of Shackles Ward. His vizar was Kamal el Estarq . Both of them were controlled by the Twisted Rune , through their agent Tamol yr Pirit , who was a lover of Kamal. Both men were aware of their manipulation by this jhasina ; they went along with it, knowing that the Twisted Rune made for powerful allies.</p>
<h2>Sabbans</h2>
<p>Shackles Ward was divided into four sabbans with thirteen drudachs .</p>
<h3>Astaré Sabban</h3>
<p>Also known as "Slaver Sabban" or "the Flesh Market", this sabban served as the holding area for new slaves being prepared for sale. It used to contain four drudachs, but the fourth, located in the center of the sabban, became a refuge dumb. Later, it was entirely enclosed with mud bricks, such that now a raised platform exists. This platform was as high as the sabban walls and served as a central marketplace for the sale of slaves.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of slaves lived in this sabban, within tiny tents or shacks.</p>
<p>The sabban mark for this sabban was a shackled hand and chain. It contained three drudachs—Suq Drudach, Filus Drudach, and Yrsh Drudach.</p>
<h3>Edijo Sabban</h3>
<p>Also known as "Penitents' Sabban", this district served as a secondary holding area for new slaves as well as a place to house the sick and dying. It was located on the southwestern tip of the city and sat atop a 30-foot cliff overlooking the coast. Because of the number of sick people clustered here, it was often the starting point for epidemics.</p>
<p>The sabban mark for this sabban was two eyes with tear drops. It contained three drudachs—Salit Drudach, Galit Drudach, and Agnab Drudach.</p>
<h3>Minqa Sabban</h3>
<p>Also known as "Sadimmin Sabban", this westernmost area of the city served as a military base for the Sadimmin , the Calishite army. New recruits tended to be posted here, as opposed to the other garrisons around the city. It contained three drudachs—Markif Dudach, Ibahr Drudach, and Astek Drudach.</p>
<h3>Qhibal Sabban</h3>
<p>Also known as "Red Veil Sabban" or "Tall Tankards Sabban", this was the cleanest section of Shackles Ward and was dedicated to entertainment. Located close to the gates to Palace Ward , it tempted merchants and nobles from that ward with brothels, gambling halls, and large, four-story taverns.</p>
<p>The sabban mark for this sabban was two oil lamps sharing a single flame, which was the family crest of el Qhibal clan. It contained four drudachs—Waga Drudach, Biteq Drudach, Terbas Drudach, and Selsela Drudach.</p>
