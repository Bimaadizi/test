<p>Celestial blades were the favored weapons of planetars .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Celestial blades were powerful enchanted bastard swords sized for planetars, (who could stand almost as tall as 9 feet (2.7 meters),) and they weighed about 12 pounds (5.4 kilograms). The planetar's weapon always glowed with light equivalent to that of a torch . It was usually enscribed with holy symbol of the deity whom the planetar served. While not at all likely to be sold in any shop on the Material Plane , scholars estimated their value to be around 18,000 gold pieces . They radiated an evocation aura of moderate strength to those who could detect magic .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A celestial blade had no special powers beyond its light and its general magical enhancement, but in the hands of a planetar or other celestial , it could cut through the inherent supernatural defenses of most evil creatures.</p>
