<p>Halfhap was a heavily fortified small town on the northern frontier of Cormyr . It was one of Cormyr's farthest-flung holdings, and had a large Purple Dragons garrison.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Halfhap was located on the Moonsea Ride at the edge of the Stonelands , halfway between the Thunder Peaks and the Storm Horns . Tilverton was about 60 miles (97 kilometers) to the northeast, the closest major settlement. To the southwest, the Ride climbed through Gnoll Pass and beyond the Storm Horns , reaching Castle Crag and then Arabel at the terminus of the Moonsea Ride about 130 miles (210 kilometers) away.</p>
<p>The Stonebolt Trail bypassed Halfhap and Tilverton entirely, running in a straight line across the Stonelands from Gnoll Pass to Shadow Gap .</p>
<p>Other notable sites in the area included the ruins of Darkenshield , the Tower of Ruin , and Wyvernwatch Castle .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>As it was functionally a heavily fortified camp for the Purple Dragons in the desolate border regions of the Stonelands, Halfhap was very dependent on imports of finished goods, especially for the military. It mostly functioned as a central point of protection and supply for the scattered prospectors, ranchers, hunters, and other rural folk who lived in the Stonelands and around the upper Immerflow river. As the gateway to the Stonelands, Moonsea, and Dalelands, it also served as a stopping point for travelers, merchants, and adventurers passing through to other lands.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>As the bulwark of Cormyr against the wilderness of the north, Halfhap was extremely well defended. It regularly dealt with Zhentarim raids, hordes of orcs , and monsters migrating out of the Stonelands. Out of its population of 2,200, approximately 1,100 were Purple Dragons , including an elite force of hippogriff cavalry. It was surrounded by a solid curtain wall, and had large gate-keeps at the eastern and western ends of the town. Four large barracks were arrayed around the inside of the wall, each housing up to 300 Purple Dragons. A large, specialized stable in the west end of town housed the hippogriffs.</p>
<p>The keeps had four floors and space for 100 soldiers to bunk. They had inner and outer gates, extensive arrow slits and murder holes, and were fitted with boiling oil dispensers and ballistae . Underground armories with winch-powered elevators supplied ballista bolts and other supplies to all levels of the keeps.</p>
<p>The garrison patrolled as far as Gnollpost in Gnoll Pass , and Mootpost , halfway to Tilverton . The heavy military presence meant that Halfhap and the roads around it were generally safe, though not at all welcoming.</p>
