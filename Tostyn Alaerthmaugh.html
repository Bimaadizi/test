<p>Tostyn Alaerthmaugh was a mercury dragon living in the Evermoors in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Tostyn usually liked to wander around the area more than remain in his lair.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Rage of Dragons of 1373 DR , during a trip to the High Forest , Tostyn was attacked by two very young green dragons who'd succumbed to madness. He killed one and injured the other and later retreated to his lair with a severe injury.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Tostyn was curious, proud, and reckless. He was totally unpredictable, changing ideas at any moment. Sometimes he fought larger dragons only to abandon the fight soon after.</p>
<h2>Relationship</h2>
<p>Tostyn's unpredictability made it hard for him to have friends. Circa 1374 DR , his only friend was the sorcerer pseudodragon Laeralyn , whom he saved from the black dragon Cheleen in the High Moor . During the Rage, unknown to him, Tostyn gained an enemy in the green dragon Chloracridara , who wanted vengeance for the death of one of her offspring and the wounding of the other.</p>
<h2>Hoard</h2>
<p>Tostyn's hoard was full of strange curiosities from all around the Realms , like a mummified beholder , a lich's coffin he was unable to open (but holding the lich Anthilar ), a green dragon skeleton in a Nimbrali glass armor, many kinds of strange golems and automatons , and many other strange things. In his wanderings, Tostyn sometimes helped adventurers, chased wyverns , destroyed pirate ships, or simply dodged among the storm clouds.</p>
