<p>Lord Ilsevele was the master of Tower Aerilpe . To Kiril Duskmourn 's recollection in 1375Â DR , he had shown sympathy to the Keepers of the Cerulean Sign in the past; she thought to inform him that the nilshai had decided to reveal themselves as agents of the Abolethic Sovereignty . His tower was deserted as of that year, with the still rotting bodies of some of the guards around it.</p>
