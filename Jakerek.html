<p>A jakerek was a type of sled used on the Great Glacier .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The jakerek, the prevailing caribou sled, was primarily intended for a solitary passenger and one caribou. Resembling the Iulutiun ikaap in design, the jakerek featured a 5 feet (1.5 meters)-long platform constructed from wood or stacked dried skins. Connecting the platform to the caribou was a lengthy cord. Seated on the platform, the rider extended their legs, while a vertical board covered with fur offered a comfortable backrest.</p>
