<p>Olanthius ( pronounced : / oʊ ˈ l ɑː n θ i ʌ s / oh-LAN-thee-us ) was a commander of the Hellriders during the mid−14 th century DR who later served as the undead general of archdevil Zariel in Avernus .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>In life and undeath, Olanthius was a person of great thoughtfulness and compassion.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Throughout his existence, he kept a series of journals, which detailed his thoughts, feelings, and later on the conflict he felt as a creature of undeath.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Following their descent into the Hells, Olanthius came to truly detest Zariel. Beyond that hatred, Olanthius felt great regret, blaming himself for failing to perceive the signs of Zariel's unwavering zeal for slaying the demonic hordes of the Abyss .</p>
<p>While he did not share the outlook of his fellow Hellrider Haruman , whom he viewed as being devoid of understanding and compassion, he held great veneration and love for General Yael .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Bow, 1354 DR , the angel Zariel led the Hellriders from Elturel to Avernus in an epic extra-planar military campaign that came to be known as the Ride . While some of the soldiers bravely fought through the ranks of devils , others retreated back to Toril , leaving Zariel with too few men to hold their ground.</p>
<p>Olanthius and his fellow commander Haruman refused to leave Zariel's side, remaining united until they were taken to Nessus and the angel was compelled to swear allegiance to Asmodeus . Distraught over the angel's betrayal of their shared ideals, Olanthius took his own life. He found no peace in death however, as he was raised as a death knight by Zariel, made to serve as her lieutenant for eternity.</p>
<p>As of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Olanthius made his home within the Crypt of the Hellriders . While he was compelled to protect the site, he could readily travel anywhere on Avernus.</p>
