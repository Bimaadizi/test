<p>Tharra was a Harper spy.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tharra hailed from Mistledale but her job with Harpers made her travel a lot.</p>
<p>In 1479 DR Tharra met Magros ; he often helped Tharra in her missions but always gained a profit from them.</p>
<p>In 1486 DR in order to save both a village and a column of refugee from a Sembian army Tharra was forced to offer her soul to Magros.</p>
<p>Magros, however, who had planned the entire situation, sent her as his spy to the secret shadovar village for captured Chosen , where she posed as a maid in the service of Adolican Rhand . She made everyone talk to each other, and kept all the people safe. She was ordered to dress Farideh with appropriate clothes.</p>
<p>Later, in the streets of the village, she approached to the disguised Dahl Peredur . Together they started plotting how to escape.</p>
<p>At last, however, after Tharra tried to kill Oota Dahl and Farideh discovered her bargain with Magros, she told them her story, but was enchained, though Farideh later asked for her assistance recovering a scroll from the Rhands' study.</p>
<p>She was eventually taken into custody by her Harper brethren so she might explain her actions to a jury of her peers.</p>
