<p>Phrennog was a middle class inhabitant of the city of Baldur's Gate in late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Phrennog was a high-skinned rock gnome woman with hazel eyes and silvered hair. She wore quality clothes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , as the Cult of the Absolute menaced the city of Baldur's Gate, the gates between the Lower City of Baldur's Gate and its more affluent Upper City were closed, monitored by the Flaming Fist mercenaries and allowing only the wealthy and current residents of the Upper City through. Gnome Phrennog was among the Baldurians who sought passage to the Upper City, suffering through the long lines and rude Fists. However, after spending some time in the queue, Phrennog started feeling something off about the Upper City, possibly sensing the Absolute â€“ the elder brain in control of the cult, hidden in the more affluent part of the Gate.</p>
