<p>Haask, Voice of Hargut was said to be one of the Seven Lost Gods who bowed before Bane long ago.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hargut was a worm-like abomination with a gargantuan mouth filled with countless rows of teeth. Its skin was a poisonous green covered in red sores, with veins and organs somewhat visible beneath. Haask survived as a symbiont attached to the outside of Hargut's body.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Haask, a monstrous greathorn minotaur , conquered Ironfang Keep in −981 DR , declaring himself priest-king of the land of Grong-Haap . He ruled Grong-Haap for six hundred years, expanding it to include the modern lands of Thar , the eastern Moonsea , and northern highlands of the Vast .</p>
<p>In the Year of Craven Words, −350 DR , Haask summoned an elder evil to combat a goblinoid horde: Hargut of the Gray Pestilence . Hargut slew tens of thousands, consigning their souls to the Barrens of Doom and Despair , but three humans, the mortals who would become known as Bane , Myrkul , and Bhaal , took advantage of the distraction to attack and nearly slay Haask, revealing his true form as a doppelganger of the elder batrachi race.</p>
<p>As Haask lay dying, the Dead Three persuaded him to agree to a ritual that would bind him and Hargut together as one entity under the command of the three adventurers. Hargut agreed, and together they became Haask, Voice of Hargut, a fell entity bound to Ironfang Keep and responsible for the creation of numerous abominations and chimerical monstrosities during the centuries that followed.</p>
<p>If freed, Haask, Voice of Hargut, would ally itself with Malar and Ghaunadaur , and work to exact vengeance on Bane and his church.</p>
