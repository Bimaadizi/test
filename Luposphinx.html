<p>Luposphinxes were a rare subspecies of sphinx distinguished by their wolf -like heads.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Luposphinxes were, like other sphinxes, largely leonine in form, about 7 feet (2.1 meters) in length, with feathered wings. Their wolvish heads set them apart from other sphinxes. The fur ranged from dark brown to light grey in color.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Luposphinxes were very intelligent but evil creatures that acted according to their desires.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Twice each day, luposphinxes could emit a frightful howl that could deafen and even panic creatures within 60 ft (18 m) of them.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>When a luposphinx got into a fight, they preferred to start with a howl, followed by melee attacks with their front claws and powerful jaws.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Luposphinxes lived in forested areas. They were generally solitary, although some were known to be served by xvarts or gnolls . They were also carnivorous and were known to prey on humanoids; luposphinxes preferred the flesh of elves and halflings .</p>
