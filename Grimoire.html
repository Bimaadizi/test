<p>Grimoires , sometimes called greatbooks , were formal, ordered collections of spells .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Greatbooks tended to be locked, guarded, and hidden, either in a secure cache or in a wizard 's abode. Most were composed with gilded ornamentation or inks, and they might even have had plates of polished ivory or platinum within them, engraved or stamped with arcane writings. They were usually large and often of unusual proportions (such as very tall for their width), and many had metal-bound corners (i.e., ornate protective caps) and chased or relief-carved covers.</p>
