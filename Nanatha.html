<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nanatha was at Malanthor's quarters when they were attacked by the thief Farl and the Prince Elminster Aumar as part of Elminster's uprising against the Magelords of Athalantar . At the moment, she had just joined him in the bath, after which she went looking for a drink while prince Aumar snuck into the room. As she spotted Elminster, she hurled a bottle at him; he dodged, and she just screamed and hid. Elminster slew Malanthor, who called on fellow Magelord Chantlarn Iyrmerr , who struck down Elminster, only to be slain by the sorceress Myrjala Talithyn who arrived soon after to bolster Elminster. Seeing Nanatha, she strategically turned her visage into that of Undarl Dragonrider and winked. Nanatha fainted.</p>
<p>Later, Magelord Alarashan Tlor came to the tower; she reported to him regarding Undarl slaying Chantlarn, and he teleported out of the tower with her. Shortly after, she was present at the tower where Ithboltar , leader of the Magelords of Athalantar, made the decision to summon all the remaining magelords to himself.</p>
