<p>Stump Bog was named after the many rotting stumps rising out of the green algae-covered waters.</p>
<p>Over the many years of bloodshed in the North a great deal of bodies were dumped into this dark bog.

Over time it became a popular and convenient site for killers, thieves , and dishonest Waterdhavians to dispose of bodies.</p>
<p>In 1026 DR , after having carried out massive raids on Waterdeep, the orc tribe Black Claw met their defeat here at the hands of Raurlor .</p>
