<p>House Veruna is a very large trading company based in Mulmaster , with several enterprising bases in Moonsea cities.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid 1470s DR , House Veruna commissioned a compound in the frontier town of Hulburg , with large help from Sergen Hulmaster . When Sergen made a bid for power in the 1479 DR and tried to have his family killed, he used several House Veruna mercenaries to keep them contained within Griffonwatch Keep , where Sergen's minions were doing their dirty work. After the Hulmasters escaped, Sergen fled Hulburg and House Veruna was banned from the town.</p>
