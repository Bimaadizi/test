<h2>History</h2>
<p>Fayr's halberd made a name for itself being wielded by Bedwyn Fayr. His adventuring company employed clever tactics of sending dwarf and halfling members into close combat while taller adventurers used halberds and bows from a distance. The group was active through the early parts of the 13 th century DR until the group was almost killed in 1252 DR . The company's two survivors, Fayr and Pep Greenfields retired their adventuring mantles and opened an antique shop in Waterdeep.</p>
<p>Thirty years later, by 1281 DR , Fayr's halberd found its way into the stock of Conlan's Smithy in Kuldahar in Icewind Dale .</p>
