<p>Kolgok Skullcrush was the leader of the ogre gang that terrorized the Wild Hills of the Delimbiyr Vale circa 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point before 1372 DR, Guruk Bonesnap inherited the title and the "crown" from Kolgok Skullcrush, after, ironically, crushing the old chieftain's skull. Under Guruk's leadership and aided by a cunning oni mage , the ogre tribe pushed a gnoll community from the old toll house in the Wild Hills and tried to get rich, collecting 3000 gp per traveler and cooking those who could not pay.</p>
