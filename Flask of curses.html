<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Appearing as an ordinary flask sloshing with liquid, the flask of curses did register as magical but the cursed nature of the magic was hidden from powers like identify . The powerful analyze dweomer spell however would reveal the true nature of the flask.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Once unstopped, the flask would either contain liquid or emit smoke, neither of which was the actual curse itself. The curse would actually trigger in the moment of unstopping, and the holder of the flask was always the target of the curse, though those nearby were sometimes also affected. The precise nature of the curse differed from flask to flask, and ranged from a reversed bless , to a monster appearing and attacking everyone nearby, to the more common curses found on magic scrolls .</p>
<p>In the Domains of Dread , flasks of curses were often of a more horrid variety than those found on Toril , with curses tending to be far stronger in effect.</p>
