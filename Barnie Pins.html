<p>Barnie Pins was a faithless inhabitant of the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the fledgling religion of the Absolute emerged and turned into a cultist crusade with an army moving from the Moonrise Towers to the city of Baldur's Gate . While some citizens were preoccupied with the "threat" of refugees or felt protected, Barnie Pins was terrified of the impending doom. Being faithless, Barnie knew nothing about prayers, gods, nor religion. He supposed that a sheep sacrifice would be in order to pray for salvation. But in desperation, Barnie left a prayer note in Stormshore Tabernacleâ€Ž , asking a god, any god, to hear his pleads and solve the threat.</p>
