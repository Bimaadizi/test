<p>A Lords' robe was an enchanted piece of clothing given to all Lords of Waterdeep . It was one of three articles, referred to collecitvely as the Lord's ensemble .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These robes were dark black and voluminous.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The magic of a Lords' robe disguised the shape and height of the Lord who wore it, making all Lords appear to be approximately 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall with an unknown gender. A true seeing spell could pierce the illusion , but even in that case the physical nature of the robe made it difficult to distinguish physical features.</p>
