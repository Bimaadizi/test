<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the city of Baldur's Gate was suffering from the encroaching war with the Cult of the Absolute , an influx of refugees, scarcity of resources, and an increase in crime. Bastian d'Zinn , a wealthy enough individual, was hit in the head with a pebble by a child playing on a road in the Lower City . The kid, Rhaneld , ended up being yelled at by Bastian, and the curfuffle attracted a small crowd of Baldurians with varied opinions on the child. Tylman Sands was one of such opinionated gawkers. He believed that the child would end up growing up a criminal.</p>
