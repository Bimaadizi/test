<p>Westgate was a seedy and squalid metropolis—with a history in piracy, powerful crime syndicates, and nameless vampiric crime-lords. Westgate thrived on black-market trade and corruption, and was perhaps one of the most sordid cities in all of Faerûn . The legacy of scoundrels and spies was found in every alley, and danger lurked for the unprepared in every corner. Despite this, it was the largest and most powerful city on the Dragon Coast .</p>
<p>It was an open city that welcomed all travelers and citizens alike as long as they abided by the local laws and, of course, had enough coin.</p>
<p>It was probably the oldest, richest and most corrupt port on the Sea of Fallen Stars . It received the nickname "Gateway to the West" from its role as the Inner Sea's most prolific port city.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>Westhavians tolerated the worship of a wide variety of gods, including evil gods, and were proud of their openness. The city's corruption extended to religious matters also, with clerics of some temples secretly pocketing donations. Many temples were all too happy to sell spellcasting services or healing potions to adventurers, as a way to earn coin.</p>
<h3>Demonym</h3>
<p>A person from Westgate was known as a Westar or a Westhavian.</p>
<h3>Culture</h3>
<p>One local chapbook of note was a mean-spirited Ambritur's Whip . The publication was penned by anonymous contributors and focused on negative coverage of local establishments and events, as well as spreading gossip and rumors.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This area of the Dragon Coast was first settled by humans from the Vilhon Reach roughly 1,000 years before the Standing Stone was erected in Cormanthor . The largest settlment was the human town of Westgate, ruled cruelly by the great topaz dragon Kisonraathiisar .</p>
<p>In the Year of Bold Poachers, −349 DR , Saldrinar destroyed Kisonraathiisar and became Westgate's first human king.</p>
<p>In the Year of Foul Awakenings, −286 DR , the vampire Orlak and a small army of mercenaries captured the city in a single night. Orlak proclaimed himself the Night King and ruled until he is defeated by a group of Lathander -worshiping paladins in the Year of Many Harvests, −157 DR .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Speaking Mountain, 257 DR , pirates from the Pirate Isles invaded Westgate and began the 200-year-long reign of the Pirate Kings.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Cat's Eye, 429 DR the Chondathan mercenary captain Mulsantir Illistine attacked Westgate and overthrew the pirate kings.</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Westgate faced unrest caused by a guild war between the infamous Night Masks and a new organization knows as the Ebon Claws . The two gangs erupted the streets of Westgate in violence at night so new visitors to the city were warned.</p>
<p>After the Spellplague , the Sea of Fallen Stars began to drain into the Underdark . The lower water level caused the shoreline to recede and, for a time, the harbor of Westgate was left high and dry. The docks were rebuilt on the new shoreline and the new dock area was known as Tidetown .</p>
<p>With the rise of the Abolethic Sovereignty , Westgate came to be known as the only port on the Sea of Fallen Stars that had never come under attack from the aboleths . By the late 15 th century DR, this had led to rumors of dark deals having been made to ensure the city's safety, and indeed it did seem to enjoy some measure of special protection.</p>
<p>During the Second Sundering the Great Rain caused the level of the Sea of Fallen Stars to rise, making flooding in Westgate commonplace. These tidal floods caused many structures to collapse, which in turn revealed the formerly hidden entrances to dungeons built in Tidetown .</p>
<h2>Foreign Policy</h2>
<p>Around the Year of the Rune Lords Triumphant, 1487 DR , following the collapse of the Shadovar -controlled Sembians, the primary foe of Westgate was Cormyr.</p>
