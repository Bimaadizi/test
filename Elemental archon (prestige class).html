<p>Elemental archons were those worshipers of the elemental lords who wholly dedicated themselves to one of the four elements. They believed the mastery of their favored element was a necessary part of their existence, and extolled the superiority of their element over all others.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>These individuals were often single-minded in the devotion to an element. They were arrogant and self-centered, never working with those who wielded the other elements. Archons reveled in the opportunity to compete against these individuals, often creating spectacular and destructive battles during their conflicts.</p>
<p>They often wandered the lands to preach to the common folk and attempt to direct them to worship of the god representing their own element.</p>
<p>Many genasi chose the path of an elemental archon in life.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>To become an elemental archon, an individual had to be capable of casting divine magic to some extent, and be able to speak one of either the aquan , auran , ignan , or terran languages.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Elemental archons were seen as prophets of sorts by the churches of Akadi , Grumbar , Istishia , and Kossuth .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>All elemental archons were able to summon forth three mephits , with whom they had a strong empathic connection.</p>
<p>An archon's connection with its chosen element granted them a number of related boons and powers. They gained inherent protection from damage associated with their element, the elemental spells they cast became more potent, and they gained an edge in combat when connected to their element (such as being suspended in air, or while near an open flame).</p>
<p>The most skilled and experienced elemental archons actually transcended their mortal form and became an elemental in humanoid form. The physical body they knew was no more, and they gained all the abilities and powers of the elemental of their chosen type.</p>
