<p>The Lonelywood Forest was an isolated stretch of woodlands located in the Icewind Dale region of the North .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The woods of Lonelywood were situated on the northeastern shore of Maer Dualdon .</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>A variety of woodland creatures typically found in the North made their home in the Lonelywood Forest, including hares , foxes , bears , and wolves .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The Lonelywood forest provided a continual source of lumber for the people of the Ten Towns. It was considered the greatest economic asset that benefited the people of Lonelywood town.</p>
<p>The nomadic Reghedmen tribesmen used lumber from the Lonelywood forest in the construction of the modular, deerskin tents they set up when forming their camps.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>In addition to its abundant natural resources, the woods offered a natural barrier to the people of Lonelywood town. Raiding parties often missed the small hamlet entirely thanks to the forest's protection. Circa the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , half-elven ranger of Lonelywood, Emmerich Hawk was a protector of the forest. On behalf of Silvanus , Emmerich regulated the activities of loggers and trappers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , a night hag took residence within the Lonelywood Forest. She took on a guise of a young apothecary calling herself the Witch o' the Woods , to not rise suspicion amongst the townies, as she put a curse of sleepless nights and nightmares on the folk of Lonelywood town to drive them to becoming soul larva . To protect her hut, the hag unleashed fiends in the depths of the forest: black abishai , erinyes , kocrachons , and hell hounds , as well as cursts and doom knights . However, as the doom of Icewind Dale began to loom over the region, a hag coven settled in the nearby areas, imposing on the Witch's territory. The Sisters of Fury , hags who served Malar , Umberlee , and Auril had to be destroyed. Just in time, the Hero of Neverwinter cleaved their way through the Lonelywood Forest to stop the nightmares. The night hag offered the Hero a deal, The Sisters's heads in exchange for returning the Hero's memories and the hag would remove the curse. Subsequently, the night hag was removed from the forest, either via the Hero's sword or by working with the hag and "convincing" her to depart in peace.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>At least two types of supernatural beings were known to have dwelled in the woods, which could not be any more different that one another. At least a small number of chwingas and a single banshee , the spectral remains of a particularly malevolent elven woman.</p>
<p>Clergy of Silvanus and locals believed that great white wolves, who appeared rarely in the Lonely Wood, were messengers of the Oakfather, who would carry the deity's vengeance out.</p>
