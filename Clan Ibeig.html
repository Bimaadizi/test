<p>Clan Ibeig was one of the dragonborn clans of the nation of Tymanther .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Clan Ibeig was a minor clan founded in 1476 DR . At the time, it had only two members, a couple of newlywed dragonborn who had retired from the Lance Defenders to live in the outskirts of Ruinspoke . Despite its numbers, Clan Ibeig was officially recognized as such by Thymari authorities. They formed their clan in the hopes that their descendants would transform it into a true, prosperous farming clan.</p>
<p>The couple lived in a small, highly defensible farmstead that looked more like a military barracks than a farm, and they made a living selling eggs, fruits, and vegetables, and their popular peach jam to the merchants of Ruinspoke.</p>
<p>They were allies of Clan Jalt . In fact, members of that clan encouraged the young couple to found their own clan.</p>
<p>In 1479 DR , the couple helped a band of adventurers to deal with kobold problems in the vicinity.</p>
<p>In 1480 DR , the couple also helped adventurers to deal with Queen Sisay 's kobold army.</p>
