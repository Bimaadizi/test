<table border='1'><tr><th>Spoken by</th><td>Grell</td></tr></table><br>
<p>The Grell language was a bizzare language spoken exclusively by grells , a strange race of aberrations , though due to its alien nature other creatures considered it to be hardly recognizable as a language.</p>
<h2>Speakers</h2>
<p>This language was exclusively known by grells, and generally considered impossible for other creatures to learn, due to the unique physiology of the aberrations. As most creatures lacked the electroreception sense of a grell, over half of the Grell language was imperceptible. Though in the late 15 th century DR , the Far Realm mutated archmage Berlain Shadowdusk managed to achieve this feat to some degree.</p>
<h2>Phonology</h2>
<p>Verbally this language consisted of various buzzing rasps, clicks, chirps, squawks, and whistles. Beyond these vocal components, meanings were conveyed through tentacle motions and the manipulation of the electrical aura each grell possessed, which was perceived through electroreception. It was possible to communicate in the language exclusively through the use of either this electrical component or the auditory component. Though as the electrical component was the means by which over half of all meanings in the language were conveyed, a great deal of detail and subtlety would be lost in the process, reducing such communication to simple messages.</p>
<p>In order to conduct complex conversations in this language or to speak exclusively through its electrical component, grells had to be within 60 feet (18 meters) of one another. For communication from greater distances, only the audible component could be used. In ideal conditions, verbal speech in the Grell language could be carried for hundreds of feet.</p>
<p>When it came to communicating exclusively through the audible or electrical component, grell typically did so in order to convey simple messages such as alarms, hunting signals, or calling for help. The electrical component component in particular was sometimes used to among grell to silently signal ambushes or to coordinate sudden attacks.</p>
<h2>Dictionary</h2>
<h3>Unknown</h3>
<p>The word used to refer to "lesser beings" in Grell was synonymous with the word used to refer to "food". Among colonial grell , that being the spacefaring grell of Wildspace , this same term was also used to refer to groundling grell, as they viewed themselves to be superior to their terrestrial cousins.</p>
