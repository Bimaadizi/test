<p>Dowagu were a race of wicked creatures that served Raja Ambuchar Devayam in the Hordelands .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A dowagu's lower body resembled that of a large snake . The hide covering their tails was exceptionaly thick. Their torso resembled that of a human with two pairs of arms and leathery wings sprouting from the back. Horns protruded from their gaunt faces. One pair rose from the dowagu's forehead, while another pair jutted from its upper jaw like tusks. All dowagu were completely black. Their beady eyes were blue and resembled stars in the night sky.</p>
<p>These creatures were only visible under the light of a full moon or light from a magical light source. Otherwise they resembled dark shadows.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Since they were usually under strict orders from Ambuchar, dowage rarely engaged in combat unless forced to do so. However, they were fearsome killers when it was required. A dowagu wielded a melee weapon effectively in each of its four hands and usually attacked with all of them at the same time. They could also strike with their tail which would cause anyone struck to flee in fear .</p>
<p>Anything touching a dowagu with bare skin, or struck by the dowagu's tail, suffered chilling physical harm that also sapped their strength permanently. A dowagu could wrap their tail around a victim to continue to drain their strength.</p>
<p>A dowagu was constantly surrounded by a 5 ft (1.5 m) sphere of silence . They could cause magical darkness over a 10 ft (3 m) radius at will. Dowagu had access to a variety of wizard spells from the school of illusion that they could cast on a daily basis. A dowagu could only be physically harmed while they were illuminated by a magical light source, otherwise any attack would simply pass straight through their body.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Dowagu were usually found alone in remote locations. One of their tasks was to mark individuals with the Stamp of Tan Chin which caused a victim to march to Solon upon their death to join Ambuchar's army as a zombie .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The six dowagu that existed were created by Ambuchar Devayam. If one was destroyed Ambuchar would create another to replace it using his dark magic .</p>
