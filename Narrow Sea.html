<p>The Narrow Sea was the main body of water in the old Netherese Empire . The Narrow sea once stretched across nearly the whole northern edge of Netheril.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Back during the Days of Thunder , the Narrow Seas ran along the eastern slopes of the Graypeak Mountains .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Humans of Netheril heavily fished the Narrow Sea, as the sea gave the Netherese most of their food.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In −33,800 DR , the wizards of the sarrukh empire of Isstosseffifil rerouted the Narrow Sea so that it flowed from west to east, thereby making it flow into the Underdark region of Phaerlin and flood the home of their enemies the phaerimm .</p>
<p>In −3859 DR , the villages of Fenwick , Gers , Gilan , Gustaf , Moran , Nauseef , and Janick on the shore of the Narrow Sea combined for mutual protection, forming the Alliance of Seventon , which later became Netheril .</p>
<p>From −3419 DR to −3416 DR , the Netherese and the dwarves of Delzoun deliberated for three years and established trade routes across the Narrow Sea.</p>
<p>During the Mythallar Age of Netheril, several mythallars were placed in the Narrow sea to warm the waters in order to curb the effects of the freezing ice.</p>
<p>In −339 DR , the mythallars of the Narrow Sea ceased to function. The enclave of Lathery fell into the depths of the sea.</p>
<p>By the start of Dalereckoning in 1 DR , the Narrow Sea had gone and been replaced by the frozen wastelands of the High Ice and the Frozen Sea .</p>
