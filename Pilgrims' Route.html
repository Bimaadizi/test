<p>The Pilgrims' Route was a trade route located in Zakhara in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Travelers departing Huzuz along the Pilgrims' Route exited the golden city through the Pilgrims' Gate before heading south. After passing the Shrine of the Brave , travelers followed the southern curvature of Al-Akara Mountains toward Zayir in the east. Another 150 mi (240 km) brought them to the Mosque of the Thirsty Jann , at which point travelers moved south for 200 mi (320 km) toward Hilm situated on Al-Muti River and the other Cities of the Pantheon .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The name of this route was derived from the bountiful supply of pilgrims traveling from the Cities of the Pantheon toward Huzuz.</p>
<p>Since it was used more by pilgrims than caravans, the chance of encountering bandits or raiders along this route was significantly less compared to other trade routes found throughout the Land of Fate.</p>
