<p>Heldreth's Horn was a fortress in Western Athalantar during the 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Horn was on the west of Athalantar. It was the outermost fortress in the realm.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Forces garrisoned at Heldreth's Horn protected loggers and farmers near the Horn Hills , where banditry was rampant.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>For as long as the keep stood, which was at least before 216Â DR , soldiers at the Horn had been spending time and money being entertained at nearby farms. This led to a number of ambushes around the Year of the Loremasters, 228 DR , where brigands targeted groups of soldiers coming back from a nearby festhall.</p>
<p>After a patrol came across an outlaw fortress, the Lawless Castle , a number of outlaws, including Eladar the Dark (actually an incognito prince Elminster Aumar ) tried to pursue the ones that rode back to Heldreth's Horn to prevent them from spreading word of the location.</p>
