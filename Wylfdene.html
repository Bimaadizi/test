<p>Wylfdene was a great Reghedmen warrior in the late 13 th century DR , once, the King of the Tribe of the Bear , later, the King of the Tribe of the Great Wyrm .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Wylfdene was a son of Faynegar the Fearless. By the time he was slain in battle on the eve of the Year of the Manticore, 1280 DR , Wylfdene was already a renowned fighter from an elder Reghedmen tribe of the frozen north. According to the tradition, Wylfdene was interred on the Burial Isle . In the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , Icasaracht , an ancient undead dragon felt kinship in the slain warrior and heard the plight of the barbarian people in the face of the Ten Towns . She willed her spirit to possess Wylfdene and reanimated his corpse. The newly returned warrior claimed he was the reincarnation of the barbarian shaman Jerrod , and under this claim, Wylfdene and Icasaracht raised a great army to conquer Icewind Dale and destroy the settlements of the Ten Towns. The new tribe was named the Tribe of the Great Wyrm and assembled members of other tribes of the north.</p>
<p>Wylfdene, or Icasaracht wearing the barbarian's body, showed disdain for the people of the Ten Towns and those who came from the south. He believed that they were disrespectful and ignorant of the Reghedmen culture. He preached that the Ten-Towners were invaders who took the land that did not belong to them and sought to conquer the north for the tribes. Wylfdene coldly stated that the southern civilization spread across Faerûn like reeking locust, polluting and desecrating the pure land of Icewind Dale. He claimed that the Ten Towners claimed the lakes after discovering the abundant fish there and soon enough, they would discover another resource and take even more from the barbarian tribes, driving them further into the glacier where the could would snuff their lives. He was not interested in trade agreements, as the tribes had nothing to trade with, negotiations, treaties, and alliances were all unacceptable.</p>
<p>When Wylfdene's Tribe of the Great Wyrm moved south towards Kelvin's Cairn and set up a war camp near Lonelywood , the speakers of Ten Towns saw the looming war – a familiar sight, and hired an assassin to pose as a Ten Towns representative. The assassin was murdered during a meeting with Wylfdene, his head placed on a pike as a warning and the security was tightened. When the Heroes of Icewind Dale were summoned to aid the Ten Towns by Wylfdene's shaman who sensed the King's undead nature, they made way to the camp and attempted to negotiate. The negations failed and Wylfdene ordered them to be executed. Subsequently, Icasaracht's spirit was separated from that of Wylfdene and she took form in the body of her white dragon offspring within her lair. Icasaracht was soon after confronted within by a band of adventurers from Kuldahar – the Heroes of Icewind Dale , and destroyed once and for all.</p>
