<p>Ruid's Stroll was a short, curving alleyway in the Southern Ward of Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This dirt and gravel paved alley stretched southeast out of Caravan Court and terminated before one of the towers of the Trollwall on Wall Street .</p>
<h2>Notable Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Ruid's Stroll was a fairly safe alley, owing to it being regularly traversed by members of the City Guard and Watch . However, it was also by haunted by the ghost of a mage , who was the alleyway's namesake.</p>
<p>Ruid 's ghost only appeared on foggy nights, dressed in dark cowled robes and wielding a staff . It always manifested at the end of Caravan Court within swirling mists, made no sound as it walked, and finally faded away as it reached the Trollwall tower. The ghost could not be banished or turned and it never reacted to the living. Anyone who touched or passed through would be shaken by a terrible, deathly chill, followed by the learning of a secret truth, specifically one about someone or something in their life.</p>
