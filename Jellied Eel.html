<p>The Jellied Eel was one of the oldest and most well-regarded restaurants in the city of Ravens Bluff . It was owned and run by a group of Ravenian knights, who purchased it out from more seedier owners, who almost ran the establishment into the ground.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The dining area featured two long, and narrow halls, with a below-ground kitchen. These halls were decorated with a few oversized paintings and a number of large brass shields .</p>
<h3>Services</h3>
<p>The Eel offered its patrons large platters with generous portions, so that no customer could ever possibly go hungry. Among their dishes were: roast potatoes with lemon , cinnamon -infused rice , crispy- beaver -pie and roast stag , covered in gravy . Despite the name of the establishment, they offered no plates of eel .</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Although the Jellied Eel has long-been a favored, upscale establishment within the city's Temple District , it fell into ill-repute for a short time. Prior to being bought by the knights, the Eel had deteriorated into a dimly-lit eatery whose main attraction was its bevy of exotic dancers. Following its change of ownership, the landmark was returned to its former glory.</p>
