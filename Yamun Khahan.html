<p>Yamun Khahan lived in the Hordelands during the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Though he came from humble beginnings, Yamun Khahan was a natural leader who possessed both charisma and strong ambition. He placed the welbeing of the clan above any individual, and tolerated no disrespect, not even from his own family. He was a cunning, brilliant military commander, and was seen as a strict but wise ruler. Yamun's stepmother, later wife, Bayalun was a useful asset on his councils as she was well-versed in Shou ways.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He had a decanter of endless water , wore a ring of free action and an enchanted chainmail while wielding an enchanted longsword in battle.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Yamun killed his father in 1335 DR , by strangling him during a skirmish with another tribe, becoming khan of the Hoekun . As was custom for the tribes, he took his fathers wife Bayalun as his own, though they maintained a cold distance.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Once he became khan of the Hoekun, Yamun organized the tribe into a small but efficient fighting force. Through sheer force, and aided allies—the Basymits —Yamun was able to subvert the Jamaqua , Dalat , and several other tribes of the Tuigan , increasing the size of his army along the way.</p>
<p>Yamun was eventually elected as the Khahan of the Tuigan. He then proceeded to conquer the Naican , Commani , and Oigur clans. Yamun chose to invite clans to join him with the hopes of preventing future blood feuds and wasting valuable lives that could be used to swell his expanding army.</p>
<p>The remaining tribes of the Hordelands either joined Yamun Khahan or were crushed by his armies in battle until all the tribes of the Endless Wastes were united under a single banner called the Grand Army of the Tuigan .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In his first year as Khan of the Hoekun, Yamun led a group of warriors against a band of ogres that dared to slaughter his personal herd. This conflict would be known as the Battle of Ejen Horo .</p>
<p>In Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , his wife Bayalun conspired with some high dignitaries of Shou Lung to kill Yamun and seize rulership for herself with help by khan Chanar , but in the end Yamun survived the assassination attempt and decided to invade Shou Lung in retaliation by breaking the Dragonwall . Bayalun was stripped of the khadun title and confined in a dead-magic zone room at Quaraband under control of Sechen Khan .</p>
<p>At first all attempts to repel him and his grand army failed, with the Shou Lung armies under the Minister of War Kwan Chan Sen broken at Tsen-Ching , a tributary of the Sheng-Ti river. However a new young general Batu Min Ho , of Tuigan ancestry, was put in charge of stopping Yamun, and despite sabotage to the Shou Lung war effort by the disgrased Kwan Chan Sen, the Grand Army of the Tuigan was encircled within the town of Shu Kuan . Vastly superior in numbers, Yamuns great force could not be dislodged, but neither could they break the siege. This led to a brief negotiation between Koja , the spokesman of Yamun Khahan, and Batu Min Ho. Yamun and Shou Lung came to an accord as the ministers responsible for the assassination attempt were handed over and subsequently killed. In a twist of fate the general who stopped the grand army asked to join it instead abandoning Shou Lung. Yamun Khahan delighted to welcome a new great general in under his banners, already planned his next conquest. With Shou Lung being a too hard nut to crack, he instead gazed west to the lands of Faerûn.</p>
<p>At first his grand army swept across eastern Faerûn, however the witches of Rashemen alerts King Azoun Obarskyr IV of Cormyr to the threat in a desperate attempt to summon reinforcements against Yamun Khahan. The Faerûnian realms however could not or would not unite against the horde, that was until the first prongs of the horde began raiding cities and towns in all the lands lying near the hordelands. A great host united against the Tuigan, of Cormyr , Earthfast , Ravens Bluff , Tantras , Hillsfar , Sembia , the Dalelands , Léthyr , and even Zhentar . The first great clashes costs the alliance all their cavalry, but with the arrivel of the dwarven host, Yamun Khahans armies are driven back.</p>
<p>At the Second Battle of the Golden Way , Yamun Khahan slayed King Torg mac Cei , but was then himself slain by King Azoun. His grand host then turned on each other, scattering into their small tribal components. General Batu Min Ho, seeing the horde disintegrate and fearing capture, committed suicide, thus joining his murdered family.</p>
<p>After Yamuns death, his son Hubadai , instead of trying to gather the splintered forces of the Grand Army of the Tuigan , would try to learn everything he could from those he defeated his father before declaring himself Khahan.</p>
