<p>The nay ( pronounced : /ˈ n eɪ / NAY ) was a Zakharan wind instrument that resembled a flute.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nays were made from dried, shellacked reeds or similar thin flora. Sounds were created by blowing through the main opening and manipulating holes made down the side of the instrument, creating a beautiful and eerie tone. The wonderful sound created by the nay inspired Zakharans to call it amir al-harab which translated from Midani into "the prince of the wild wastes."</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Despite the somewhat eerie sound that conjured thoughts of a haunted desert, the nay was used almost exclusively by the urban Al-Hadhar .</p>
