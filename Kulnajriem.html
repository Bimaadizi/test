<p>In the late 15 th century DR, Kulnajriem left his home in the Heartcoil Deeps to travel the surface when his people were displaced by mind flayers led by Qholillaroon .</p>
<p>When adventurers reported the highly unusual sighting of him on Harvestshield Mountain , it alerted the Open Lord of Waterdeep , Laeral Silverhand , that something must have been amiss in the Heartcoil Deeps. Although Kulnajriem fought with the adventurers, they parted without killing each other, and he left behind several of his throwing stones carved with messages of warning for the surface world.</p>
