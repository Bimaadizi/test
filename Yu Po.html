<p>Yu Po was the personal scribe of Imperial Minister Hsieh Han Liu of the Shou Lung embassy in the Dragon Coast region of Faerûn during the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was a skeptical but faithful imperial servant, who was wholly dedicated to his role serving Minister Hsieh. While he was prone to occasional missteps, the minister had faith in Yu Po's capabilities.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>While Yu Po spoke for Hsieh and acted as his public translator, the elder minister was fully capable of speaking and understanding the Common language of Faerûn. He also gave direct orders to the minister's guards, as per his wishes.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Yu Po was extremely loyal to and defensive of Minister Hsieh, ready to raise his weapon to his master's defense at a moment's notice.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR , Yu Po was present with the minister when his caravan was intercepted by Vaerana Hawklyn and the Maces of Elversult and then escorted to the Ginger Palace while they negotiated the release of the captured Harper agent Ruha , and remained there until they made an ally of the Bedine sorceress.</p>
<p>Shortly after their initial arrival, Yu Po attended Minister Hsieh as he began talks with Vaerana Hawklyn about how to best deal with the threat of the Cult of the Dragon , and their undead master Hethcypressarvil . He accompanied the minister towards Elversult , to the point just prior to when Hsieh helped lead a final stand against the dragon and its cult.</p>
