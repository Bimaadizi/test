<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Kaeira signed on to guard a merchant caravan to Baldur's Gate . When they were less than a league away, the caravan was waylaid by Xantam's Thieves Guild . During the night, they slaughtered many of her fellow guards, and stole almost all of the caravan's goods, including a set of expensive Amnian spices . Looking for the thieves, she headed to the Elfsong Tavern. The adventurers Kromlech , Vahn , and Adrianna approached Kaeira, who seemed down her luck. She told the adventurers not to spend much time around her, as her misfortune seemed to spread to others. However, she told them of her tale, and they went out looking for these spices.</p>
<p>The adventurers headed out to look more into the thieves' guild. Among their stash, they found the box of rare spices. After this, they traveled back to the tavern and handed them to Kaeira. She thanked the team, and bestowed upon them a +1 iron shield .</p>
<p>Later, she became wounded after being ambushed by Red Fang marauders. Many of the caravaners were slain, some fled towards the Wayfork Village , others â€“ kidnapped. The caravan's leader Randalla Brasshorn was amongst those kidnapped and dragged into the marauders' camp in a cavern within the Trollbark Forest .</p>
