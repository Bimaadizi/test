<p>An Ching Wang was a kensai of the town of Cham Fau in the Ch'ing Tung province of Shou Lung and later a member of the Emperor's guard in the spelljammer spaceport city of Chunming in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Like her siblings, An Ching was trained in the martial arts by her father, Master Wang Ho of the Wang Ho School in Cham Fau. She garnered a reputation as an excellent warrior. An Ching fell in love with a fellow student of her father, Chien Jang Liang, though he was at first oblivious to her feelings.</p>
<p>However, when Chien injured Wang Ho in a training accident involving a deadly technique in Shou Year 2606 (1356 DR) , he dramatically abandoned the Wang Ho School to become a poor wanderer in penitence. At first, An Ching was torn but decided to follow him and look for a way for him to redeem himself. She'd been encouraged to "follow her heart" by a visiting White Lady of Kwan Ying , who said "things would work out".</p>
<p>Things did not work out and, after following her lover to Chunming, An Ching enlisted in the Emperor's guard, becoming one of the first women to serve by Shou Year 2617 (1367 DR) . She also became betrothed to Yu Fu Tieh, a samurai . Coincidentally, he had also maimed her father in an apparent training accident, but in a dispute over taking kensai skills to space via spelljamming.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>An Ching was the daughter of Wang Ho and the sister of Yen Tsu Wang and Ju Huo Wang .</p>
<p>After loving Chien Jang Liang , she was later betrothed to Yu Fu Tieh . But he was deeply jealous and would duel to the death anyone who threatened their relationship.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Small of build, she was considered lovely and beautiful.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Although she was charming, An Ching quickly grew irritated by men trying to flirt with her, not least because she was already betrothed.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>She was among the kensai who guarded the spaceport at Chunming. She was known to be approachable and willing to share or sell information that was not considered secret or embarrassing to the government. She had learned some aspects of spelljamming from her father.</p>
