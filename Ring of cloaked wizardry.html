<p>Rings of cloaked wizardry were special rings found in Zakhara , the Land of Fate, whose enchantments were difficult to detect by magical means.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These rings were similar to any other magic ring found on Al-Toril save for the fact that casting detect magic did not reveal that the ring was in fact magical. Spells such as identify and legend lore worked normally when used on a ring of cloaked wizardry .</p>
