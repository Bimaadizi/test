<p>Lugribossk (meaning "Fear Lord" or "feared master" in Undercommon ) was a proxy for the illithid god Ilsensine . Ilsensine most often sent the proxy in the deity 's stead to effect events outside of its realm, the Caverns of Thought . It was often sent to help illithids in bold plans of subjugating the thrall races.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Outside of combat, Lugribossk appeared as a normal ulitharid (a 7 feet (2.1 meters) tall, six tentacled illithid).</p>
<p>When enraged or in combat, Lugribossk and its tentacles would grow to a height of 30 feet (9.1 meters), the nails on its hands and feet growing into black, menacing claws and its eyes glowing like beacon fires. Its skin turned mauve and left a trail of purple radiance wherever it walked.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>In his normal form, Lugribossk was similar in ability to an average ulitharid. Lugribossk achieved his combat form by calling upon the power of Ilsensine, requiring about ten minutes to transform. Because of how long its tentacles grew to in its combat form, Lugribossk could not extract brains in that state, its tentacles being glorified battering rams that dripped with the flesh-dissolving enzyme that was often on a mind flayer's tentacles.</p>
<p>Luggribossk had access to more psionic energy than the vast majority of illithids. It had the ego whip , id insinuation , and psionic blast psionic attacks and access to all psionic defenses, as well as the psionic powers of astral projection , awe , control body , body equilibrium , dominance , ESP , levitation , post-hypnotic suggestion , probability travel , and teleport . The proxy also had access to the unique disciplines of collapse time , crisis of breath fatal attraction , intrusive taste link , and shards .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>When incarnating in his ulitharid form, Lugribossk took on the role of an important Creedmaster of a distant illithid hive visiting for some important consultation.</p>
