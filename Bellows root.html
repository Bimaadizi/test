<p>Bellows root was a common forest plant that possessed emetic properties used in medicine and was found in the Wood of Sharp Teeth in the Western Heartlands .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bellows root could be crushed and drunk in a tea in order to provoke vomiting in the imbiber, human and dragon alike. Bellows root looked similar to another plant, maiden's milk , which possessed antitussive properties.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Long before the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , bellows root became a part of history when the logging camp of Hornhollow at the edge of the Wood of Sharp Teeth was visited by a senile red dragon , Craum Straug , whose dire cough lit the settlement ablaze. A traveling minstrel , Aznee Fraystrings , was tasked with removing the dragon and thought that he could prepare maiden's milk tea to help the wyrm like it helped his elderly uncle once. Aznee, however, made a mistake and made a bellows root tea instead, causing the dragon to vomit the tea out along with his draconic flame breath, incinerating the minstrel instantly. This vomiting fit eventually killed the geriatric dragon.</p>
