<p>Quaal's feather tokens ( pronounced : / k w ɑː l / kwal or : / k w eɪ l / kwayl ) were tiny magical objects that could be used only once before being exhausted. Several types of feather tokens existed, each with their own magical effect, with a power selected to meet a specific purpose.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The forms of Quaal's feather tokens were as diverse as their magical effects. The only common feature was that most of them were ornamented with feathers, or were no more than just a feather.</p>
<p>Elven mages sometimes used the feathers of greatswans as the main component to create Quaal's feather tokens .</p>
