<p>Inglor Brathren was a member of the Zhentarim at Bargewright Inn during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personailty</h2>
<p>Inglor believed that Nalaskur Thaelond was lining his pockets at the expense of the Zhentarim. He also suspected that Chalaska Muruin was turning a blind eye to Nalaskur's skimming, but he feared Chalaska.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1491 DR , Inglor decided that both Chalaska and Nalaskur needed framing and replacing. Taking advantage of the absence of Nalaskur, he devised a complex plot to frame Chalaska as a thief at the expense of the Zhentarim. However, some adventurers who happened to be at the inn uncovered and defeated him.</p>
