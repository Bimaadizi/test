<p>In Mirtul of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Marlin Stormserpent paid the artist Jharakphred to follow two people, Lord Gariskar Dauntinghorn and Draskos Crownsilver and then paint a portrait of them. The artist shadowed them for days so closely that he had to be beat off by their retinue with cudgels. Marlin then ordered his two blueflame ghosts , Relve Langral and Treth Halonter , to learn the men's likenesses from their portraits to better identify and kill those men. In the eve of the Council of the Dragon , blueflame ghosts murdered Seszgar.</p>
