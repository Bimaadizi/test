<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Steelclaw was a female hairless cat who thought herself to be a dangerous killer and a powerful foe. She referred to humanoids as "the furless ones."</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Steelclaw could be found just outside the walls of the Moonrise Towers in the deadly Shadow-cursed Lands . The cat traveled through lapping waters on leaking ships to get to her new hunting territory. Steelclaw found a prey she enjoyed killing â€“ illithid tadpoles birthed by the Absolute , who dwelled underneath the towers. Steelclaw patiently awaited new tadpoles to emerge, only to end their lives and drink their drying cries in.</p>
