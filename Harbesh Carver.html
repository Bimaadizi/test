<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Harbesh was an unpleasant individual. A shield dwarf outcast and a thug liked to stay out of any discussions or arguments that sparked between his teammates. He was a grumpy, capable, smart, and very strong individual who showed more interest and affection to a difficult lock than even the friendliest man or woman.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Harbesh wore a set of leather armor and was armed with a short sword as well as a small crossbow .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Harbesh joined his adventuring group sometime before the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , when he, along with the Hands of Fury, traveled aboard a pirate ship to the city of Luskan , ending up stranded there after the further marine plans fell apart. Seeing no other opportunities for profit, the troupe answered a call for mercenaries coming from the far northern town of Targos , besieged by the Legion of the Chimera .</p>
