<p>Sarutobi's Stone Breakers were unique enchanted bracers created in the distant land of Shou Lung .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Created to be worn only by law-abiding human monks , these gauntlets increased the wearer's strength and dealt greater damage when the monk used their fists in combat, especially when landing serious blows.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sarutobi's Stone Breakers were commissioned by a wealthy and well-meaning merchant of Shou Lung for a legendarily skilled monk named Sarutobi for his upcoming battle with a fearsome stone giant . However, the legend stated that the martial artist declined the gift, declaring "I will crush this giant's skull with my bare hands, and I need no magic to help me do it!" thinking his talent was enough. Sarutobi was right. He won the duel and the Stone Breakers were locked away unused in the merchant's vault.</p>
<p>Later, the martial artist went missing after entering a gate that took him to planes unknown. Following Sarutobi's disappearance, the merchant gifted the Stone Breakers to the monk's son, who devoted the rest of his life to an unsuccessful search for his father.</p>
<p>Years later, by 1281 DR , Sarutobi's Stone Breakers had found their way to freezing Icewind Dale and into the hands of a halfling cleric of Waukeen , Quinn Silverfinger , of the Golden Lodge in Lonelywood . He offered these unique bracers for sale to adventurers in that year.</p>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Sarutobi's Stone Breakers ended up in the hands of the shady drow merchant Nym . They were available for purchase from his camp outside Bryn Shander 's wall.</p>
