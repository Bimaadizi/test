<p>Urling was a small, hidden-away settlement located in the Urlingwood forest of Rashemen . It was home to many witches of the nation's Wychlaran .</p>

<p>Urling was situated on the southern stretch of the Urlingwood, in central Rashemen.</p>

<p>The various herbs and fruits needed to make jhuild , also known as Rashemi firewine, could be found and harvested in the area around Urling.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Lady Yhelbruna led the community of of Urling circa the early 1470s DR , assisted by Nythra of the Seven Rivers . Nythra served as a go-between for the hathrans and the other Rashemi of the community, and spoke to any of its outlander visitors.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>For many years, travelers were allowed to stay overnight in Urling, and in those instances only for a day or two. Various sources differed as to whether or not intruders were actually punished by execution or if that was merely exaggeration.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>While Urling was the home to many hathrans of Rashemen it was not exclusive to their order as was the Urlingwood. Rashemaar commoners native to the country were allowed residence within, including the witches' spouses, family members, and servants.</p>
