<p>Llander was one of the bandits under the Iron Fox in the mid–8 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The men of the Iron Fox wore light armor and brought no lances or horses.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Elminster Aumar , a Chosen of Mystra , carried out a scouring of the bandits in Buckralam's Starn , Llander remained with his boss, the Iron Fox, until moments before his death at Fox Tower . They were attacked at the mess hall, where Elminster ambushed them using one or more crossbows from a gallery overlooking them; Tarthane then dashed up the gallery on the boss' orders, together with fellow bandit Tarthane .</p>
<p>At the top of the stair, Elminster dropped a tapestry on Llander, and then stabbed through the cloth. Llander fell down the stairs blindly, apparently slain.</p>
