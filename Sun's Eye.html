<p>The Sun's Eye was the northern most province of the Yikarian Empire in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This province was unique among others of the Empire in that most of its terrain was not dominated by the sprawling World Pillar Mountains . The Sun's Eye covered a wide area of land leading from the mountains in the east to the coast of the Great Sea in the west while also bordering much of Konigheim to the north.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The albino Coral Princess was the governor of the Sun's Eye province.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Because of its position along the Great Sea and Konigheim, the Sun's Eye province offered distinct strategical advantages over the other provinces of the Yikarian Empire. Mainly, it connected the yak-folk with the outside world, exposing them to sailors from the sea and barbarians from the north, allowing access to vital trade items as well as slaves. Goods smuggled into the Empire often entered through the Sun's Eye province.</p>
<p>The navy of the Yikarian Empire was based in Lipo .</p>
