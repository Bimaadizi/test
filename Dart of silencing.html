<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>If this dart missed a living target, it did nothing and could be reused. However, if it successfully struck a target, it enveloped the victim and a continuous area of a 5 feet (1.5 meters) radius around them in temporary magical silence. This silence persisted even if the dart was removed and discarded. The effect could be ended prematurely with dispel magic .</p>
