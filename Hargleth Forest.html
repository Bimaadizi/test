<p>The Hargleth Forest was a large forest located in eastern Eskorn , Laerakond .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This forest was dotted with countless ancient ruins that dated back to the time when Eskorn was ruled by dragons . The area was inhabited only by monsters and outlaws, and all roads and trails in Eskorn faded away in the forest.</p>
<p>The forest was good for hunting, either for sport or for food, and hunters from nearby Mistshaws usually hired adventurers to deal with monsters or bandits hiding in the forest.</p>
