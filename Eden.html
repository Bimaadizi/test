<p>Eden of the Clearlight was the leader of the Coin Spinners gang in Luskan in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was a self-proclaimed high priestess of Tymora , but in reality she was a self-serving, greedy person with few, if any divine powers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When she was young, her mother drank herself to death. At an early age, she joined an adventuring company and left Luskan for a while. The Coin Spinners were active in Luskan at least as early as 1475 DR , so Eden had apparently returned to Luskan by then.</p>
<p>In 1480 DR , Eden hired Toytere , the leader of the Dead Rats gang, to kidnap Myrin Darkdance . After Myrin was captured, Eden was approached by Lilten , a high priest and chosen of Beshaba and ordered to leave Myrin alone.</p>
<p>A few days later, Kalen Dren cowed each of the gangs in Luskan over a ten-day period and announced a public assembly to select a king of Luskan. Eden showed up with her Coin Spinner entourage and the assembly of gangs quickly broke into a melee. The demon Scour arrived in the form of a swarm of vermin and attacked the gangs, killing many. Eden used magic (either magic items or possibly divine spells ) to shield her followers from the swarm and many rival gang members flocked to her banner.</p>
<p>Later, Lilten gave Eden a scroll that had the power to invoke the Abyssal Fury plague. When Eden ignored Lilten's instructions regarding Myrin, he showed up at her temple. Thinking she could summon the plague swarm to attack Lilten, Eden read the scroll. Unfortunately for Eden, the plague had been banished by Kalen and rather than summoning the plague swarm, she summoned a swarm of common vermin that devoured her.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Eden was not an attractive woman. She had a lame leg and wore a brace. She had one missing eye, in which she wore her platinum coin.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Eden had a magical platinum coin that could absorb most harmful magic, which she wore in her empty eye socket.</p>
<p>Eden lived in the Clearlight , Tymora's run-down temple in Luskan.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Eden was Kalen's older sister but they despised each other. Eden enjoyed dallying with hunky men.</p>
