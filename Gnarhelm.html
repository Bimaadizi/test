<p>Gnarhelm was a Northlander kingdom located in the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Gnarhelm was located on the large island of Alaron , north of the Fairheight Mountains . Gnarhlem was a realm filled with tough terrain. Much of the land was rocky, with steep hills and exposed cliffs. Gnarhelm had more roads and overland travel routes than any other Northlander kingdom. The capital city, also called Gnarhelm , lay on Salmon Bay near the center of the kingdom.</p>
<p>The climate of Gnarhelm was quite harsh. The realm was often covered in clouds and rain was common. Vicious storms from the Trackless Sea were common.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Gnarhelm was an independent kingdom prior to joining into the United Moonshae Isles under High Queen Alicia Kendrick in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , and would henceforth swear fealty to her successors in Caer Callidyrr . As of the late 15 th century DR, Gnarhelm was ruled by High King Derid Kendrick .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Gnarhelm had a smaller navy than other Northlander kingdoms, with only a few dozen longships . The kingdom had more horses than other Northlander realms and used cavalry as part of their large army. The military of Gnarhelm was capable of dealing with most threats to the realm.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Gnarhlem was one of the main trading ports of the Northlanders. Merchants from Waterdeep often docked here, trading gold , oil , and liquor for slaves and Ffolk -crafted weapons. Northlander longships sailed from Gnarhelm to both Ruathym and Waterdeep. Gnarhelm traded with the Ffolk to the south, trading raw materials for alcohol and food.</p>
<p>Gnarhlem was a mineral-rich kingdom, and the only Northlander kingdom that had extensive mines. Rich veins of copper , gold , iron and silver existed within the realm. Due to the terrain and climate, Gnarhelm had little agricultural output, and instead they relied on their mineral wealth to trade for food. The waters to the north of the realm were plentiful fishing grounds.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The human inhabitants of Gnarhelm were traditionally Northlanders. They were not as skilled as sailors as other Northlanders due to the difficulty in sea travel around the kingdom, and s a result, they were much more comfortable traveling and fighting on land. Following the unification of the Moonshae Isles in 1371 DR, intermarriage and cultural exchange accelerated between Gnarhelm and the Ffolk of the south, and within a century, these distinct Northlander and Ffolk cultures had merged to create a new and distinctly Moonshavian identity amongst the majority of Gnarhelm's humans.</p>
