<p>Scardale Town was the capital city of the region of Scardale , although it had lost this distinction for a period of time, and was often served as largest city in all of the Dalelands . It was located along the Dragon Reach where the River Ashaba ended its course. The port city was once the most busy and important in the region, and its population endured war, occupation by armed forces, and a devastating plague.</p>
<p>After nearly a century of turmoil, enduring a number of different governments Scardale Town reclaimed its status as the seat of power for Scardale after the Sembian takeover in 15 th century DR . By 1479 DR it had been re-established as the capital of Scardale, albeit as a subjugated realm of Sembia and, by extension, the Netherese rule of the Shadovar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the defeat and disappearance of Lashan Aumersair , following the second inter-dale war in 1356 DR , many Scardalesmen left the city for outlying villages and farms. The government of Scardale, whose seat of power was in Scardale Town at the time, was taken over by an occupying coalition of forces from Hillsfar . Sembia, Zhentil Keep , and the other dales led a 13-person council. The council members appointed a Provisional Lord, Myrian Beechwood . Although the people of the dale recognized him as their actual leader, he was almost completely restrained from having actual power.</p>
<p>The years of the occupation were very detrimental to Scardale Town. Trade was closed for a decade, only being reopened around 1367 DR . Despite the large number of soldiers stationed in the city, banditry was rampant, and the great drop in the populace opened the port city to malevolent merchants and groups like the Zhentarim . Some shops and traders remained in the town, most notably dealing in prostitution and illicit goods, but the population was less than half of what it was before the war.</p>
<p>Following the trauma of war and military occupation, Scardale Town would see the most destructive event in its history in 1370 DR with the outbreak of the Shaking Plague . Between the deaths caused by the disease and the Scardalefolk leaving the city, the population of the city was again cut in half. The already-crumbling coalition forces were nearly completely wiped out, with the Sembian garrison being hit especially hard, with only three individuals surviving. Regardless, the city continued on in anarchy and lawlessness, rampant with gangs, religious cults, and agents of evil organizations. The reformed government, led by Provisional Governor Khelvos Dermmen in Chandlerscross , wavered between calling the city a loss and formulating a plan to reclaim it for the dale as a whole.</p>
<p>When Chandlerscross was sacked by Sembian mercenaries in the Year of the Walking Trees, 1421 DR , the capital of Scardale was moved back to Scardale Town.</p>
