<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1374 DR , Maloran joined the Elves of Cormanthor at their Myth Drannor outskirts camp as they worked to reclaim the city. When the lich Droic Orgul and his Red Wizards stole the Key to the Mythal from Ildrannath's Tower , he helped Tarathiel Miastina counter their works. Maloran put together an investigation into the Irithlium , where he knew the Red Wizards were holed up and likely keeping valuable documentation on their nefarious plans. The plan was a success, leading to the defeat of Thramont the Watchful and discovering the importance of the long-dead Earynspieir Ongluth .</p>
