<p>Minthalue was a female human wizard living in Suzail in Cormyr in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<p>She was once a famed Calishite exotic dancer, before she went to the mage Kappiyan Flurmastyr of Waterdeep and became his apprentice. This prompted gossiping throughout Waterdeep for more than a year, but Minthalue became a notable sorceress and accomplished mage before the 1360s DR.</p>
