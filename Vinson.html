<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Striking Falcon, 1333 DR , Lord Kirsoph managed to become a founder of the Council of Six and became Dahaunarch . He attempted to have Pommarch Wulver Xornnag assassinated in the Year of the Behir, 1342 DR , but he was slain by his own bribed guards in return.</p>
<p>Losing their patriarch in Athkatla , the Vinsons retreated to Trailstone under the leadership of Nastral Vinson and quietly managed their countryside estates and vineyards. They remained relatively powerful and wealthy, but consciously chose to live in obscurity and refused to engage in the high-stakes plots and intrigue of Amn.</p>
