<p>Nalitheen was the widow of Borold in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>Nalitheen favored drab clothing. Her face was rather plain, eschewing decor, and she had a very particular nose, large and prominent.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Her two daughters, Boroldira and Naleetha became orphaned with the death of her husband, Borold , two summers prior to the year in which she got acquainted with Mirt the Merciless , 1321 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nalitheen bore two daughters during her marriage to Borold at some point prior to 1319 DR , the year around which he was killed protecting silver bars belonging to Waterdeep from pirates out of Amn . She became a coinlass afterwards; by Eleint 6 of 1321 DR , she hadn't been doing that for long, however. At that time, she crossed paths with Mirt the Merciless at the Scarlet Slipper tavern. She became fixated on him at that point, knowing him to be the leader of the force that killed her husband, and hosted him that night at her home for one gp . She very nearly slew him, but instead showed him her daughters. He gave her a large sum, and said he'd be back, apparently implying he wanted her to host him again.</p>
