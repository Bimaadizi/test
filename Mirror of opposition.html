<p>Mirrors of opposition were a type of enchanted mirror with a duplicative effect.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Whenever a creature was reflected in a mirror of opposition , it would conjure a duplicate of them that sought to kill the original creature. These duplicates were exact, possessing the same items and powers as the original, including those of a magical nature. If destroyed they would disappear alongside their duplicated belongings. Destroying a duplicate's original also had the same outcome.</p>
<h2>History</h2>

<p>In 1368 DR , a 10‑foot-square (3‑meter) mirror of opposition hung within the the Blue Alley .</p>
