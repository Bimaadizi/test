<p>The Evise Jhontil was an artifact of the clergy of Set . In the Year of the Slaying Spells, 976 DR , it was moved to Lliiress , where it was used by the blue dragon Gerinvioch to trap the entire population in a bubble where casting spells would kill its users.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Evise Jhontil was shaped like a diamond, standing nearly four feet long and two wide. Its shape was octagonal. While operating in Lliiress , it spun continuously, and blinking orange lights danced around it, faster the more magic that was used in its vicinity.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Anyone who attuned themselves to the Evise Jhontil by touching it would find that any spell subject to permanency would be made permanent, at grievous cost to their lifeforce. The caster was permanently bonded to his spells as well, making it impossible for them to be dispelled, including antimagic field , mordenkainen's disjunction or even wish . On the caster's death, the spell would cease.</p>
<p>When Gerinvioch employed the device in Lliiress in 976 DR , the dragon performed some ritual beforehand. The dragon was also able to employ the artifact right before then to create a barrier extending about a mile from the center of town, which prevented egress from the vicinity of the artifact while still allowing ingress. At the same time, it hid the area from just about all known means of discovery, including sight, hearing, and even most magic.</p>
<p>The effect of the artifact was slightly different on those within the barrier, subjecting anyone who employed a spell in its vicinity to a draining of their lifeforce that continued to power the spell repeatedly until it induced their deaths. The effect somehow extended to most magic items, causing their destruction soon after activation. Even instant spells such as teleport instead forever blinked the caster between their location and their source every few moments.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The artifact was said to be created by Set as an aid to his faithful in order to overthrow the ancient Imaskari civilization.</p>
<p>In 976 DR , Aniolon Gruanthe struck a bargain for the protection of the town of Lliiress for the blue dragon Gerinvioch , if his people would acquire the Evise Jhontil for the dragon. Aniolon Gruanthe sent several of his men to a ruin which contained a temple of Set . Less than a tenday later, they returned with the artifact; they related that the location, despite being uninhabited for about a half millenium, since the mid-to-late 5 th century DR , had enough traps to kill a half dozen of them, while an efreeti killed four more while they returned. Once given the artifact, the dragon created a barrier that would hide the town from anyone permanently.</p>
<p>However, the dragon's barrier also made it impossible to leave the area enveloped by the barrier while allowing entrance,
and caused anyone who cast a spell inside the barrier to die as their lifeforce was constantly stolen to power the spells. A few people entered the location every so often, joining the permanent population, but as of 1372 DR , no one had left. On that year, a mage from Estagund , Kinase Bronihim , sought out Gerinvioch for the Evise Jhontil . The dragon directed him towards Lliiress , where Bronihim remained, unable to escape, for at least months.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Gerinvioch demanded the Evise Jhontil of Aniolon Gruanthe in exchange for his protection in 976 DR . In 1372 DR , the reputation of the Evise Jhontil was such that Kinase Bronihim sought the dragon for it.</p>
