<p>Erudites were psions who abstained from specialization in one of the disciplines , instead devoting themselves to a scholarly and self-reflective path that expanded the capacity of their minds, unlocking greater psionic potential.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>As an unorthodox method of power, across the Realms erudites were comparatively far fewer in number than traditional psions, as well as the other more common psionic pathways, those of the psychic warrior , soulknife , and wilder . They could potentially be found anywhere that psions were commonly encountered. Among human regions, this frequently meant areas that were built over top of the ruins of ancient psionic civilizations, such as the Vilhon Reach , a region where the psiocracy of Jhaamdath once stood. Other possible areas of encounter included the regions of Chult and Tashalar , anywhere that stood above duergar or illithid cities, and areas with strong wild psionic fluctuations. However, by far erudites were more likely to be found in institutions of learning, such as Candlekeep .</p>
<p>In order to obtain the power an erudite, a psion had to devote themselves to a strict schedule of prolonged studying of psionic lore, as well as practicing, meditating to try unlocking latent abilities, and accumulating knowledge on the Invisible Art. Those who broke from their austere schedule for the life of an adventurer often did so in service of exercising their mastery of the Invisible Art, searching for new troves of psionic lore, other psionic individuals to make deals with, and rare power stones . An erudite's reasons for adventuring could otherwise be any of the noble or ignoble motives that other adventurers had for pursuing such a life.</p>
<p>The alignments exhibited by erudites differed little from traditional psions. While they were not limited to any particular philosophical paths, due to an introspective world view they typically leaned in equal measure towards neutral evil and neutral good , and far favored lawful alignments over chaotic ones, as chaos was generally anathema to the disciplined and studious lives erudites led.</p>
<p>They were equally as likely to come from any of the psionically-inclined humanoid races, but humans seemed most apt to follow the erudite path. Savage and monstrous humanoids generally lacked the necessary physical studies an erudite.</p>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>Like any psion, erudites were not particularly drawn to one deity or another, but it was uncommon for them to be worship those that were revered for their intelligence and wisdom.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Erudites drew from the same well of powers as traditional psions. The repertoire of powers they had access to was comparatively wider, granting them greater flexibility and versatility. However, they were limited by having access to only a small subset of unique powers each day and were restricted in their capacity to learn discipline powers.</p>
<p>In order to learn most discipline powers an erudite had to learn it from power stone or the known powers of a psion, wilder, or other erudite. In the latter case an erudite had to make mental contact with a willing or unconscious individual, a process similar to addressing a power stone and requiring some skill in psicraft . Mental contact gave an erudite insight to all powers known by the individual. They could then attempt to gain an understanding of individual powers, allowing them to either manifest it right away or permanently commit it to their own ingrained repertoire of powers.</p>
<p>Committing to memory a power gleaned through mental contact required an eight hour period of meditation. The individual or power stone did not need to remain in proximity to the erudite during this. Should they manifest any other powers during the duration of this meditation the erudite would lose their focus on the power they were trying to memorize.</p>
<p>This process posed no harm to the individual being learned from, though it would remove the power from a power stone . This did not grant erudites access to powers unavailable to psions. If they failed, an erudite would be unable to make another attempt at learning or manifesting a power. Erudites could only overcome this by improving their mastery of psicraft.</p>
<p>For those willing to grant the privileged of learning from them, most individuals or creatures would charge an erudite some kind of fee. Erudites that were on friendly terms with one another may agree to trade access to powers of equal strength at no charge.</p>
<p>In battle an erudite was swift and merciless with their application of powers, though consciously tried to keep at least one defensive and offensive power available at all times. They often preferred to fight from a defensive position, acting as support or a form of "artillery" for a group.</p>
<h3>Psicrystal</h3>
<p>Like traditional psions, erudites possessed the capacity to create a psicrystal , a physical extension of their own personality. Measuring roughly the size of a human hand, these crystaline constructs offered a number of special benefits to erudites.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Like other psions, when forced to resort to a material weapon an erudite commonly wielded either a club , dagger , heavy crossbow , light crossbow , quarterstaff , or shortspear . In terms of armor , the average erudite was not particularly proficient in any one form.</p>
