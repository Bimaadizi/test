<p>Positoxins were special alchemical mixtures distilled with holy water and laced with positive energy . They effected corporeal undead the way poisons effected the living.</p>
<p>Positoxins could break down an undead's physical body, potentially permanently. Such substances also disrupted the negative energy that animated the creatures.
