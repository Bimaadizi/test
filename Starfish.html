<p>A starfish , also known as a sea star , was a creature that was found in underwater locations across Toril .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These marine creatures had five arms that met at a common center.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Though many starfish were completely harmless, some appeared to be both agile and vicious. It was possible for starfish to leap onto others' faces and strongly cling on to them with their multiple arms. An incredible feature of starfish was that they could completely grow back lost limbs.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Starfish were not combatants that adventurers typically worried about, as their attacks did not seem to hurt.</p>
<h2>Species</h2>
<p>There existed numerous species of starfish across the Realms, that came in a variety of different colors and sizes. In the Sea of Fallen Stars alone, there were over two hundred different types of sea star.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Starfish were known to live in kelp gardens and reefs , and they moved by curling and crawling. They clung to walls in underwater locations and were known to feed on clams and mussels , and in at least one instance, brains. If they went without water, they would dry up and die.</p>
<p>A few creatures, such as the storm giants of Maelstrom , wore necklaces made from starfish.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Great Harvests, 1325 DR , Artek and Corin found a talking skull that had once been a cleric of Lathander . His flesh had been eaten by fish , and his brain was sucked out by a starfish.</p>
<p>Aggressive starfish inhabited a merman 's sunken garden in the catacombs beneath Waterdeep circa 1357 DR . These starfish were friends with the merman and attacked intruders.</p>
<p>In the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , the bard Bareris Anskuld wrote a ballad about a starfish that believed that it lived in the sky instead of the sea. This fictitious starfish had a comical journal where it attempted to make its place among the stars. This ballad was known to be a favorite of the Rashemi artisan, Tammith Iltazyarra .</p>
