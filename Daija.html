<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Lender Daija was tasked with heading a shrine of Waukeen, the Merchant's Friend in the mercantile fortress of the Crossroad Keep. However, the city of Neverwinter was still recovering from the Shadow War and failed to provide the Church of Waukeen with promised funds. Soon after the merchant princess Sa'Sani and her Mercantile House were put in charge of the Keep, Lender Daija approached the merchant's partners, but not for a donation of funds. Lender Daija believed the tenant of her church â€“ that a deal had to be upheld by the party who initiated the deal. Until the Crossroad Keep or Neverwinter fulfilled the agreement, she stayed at the Phoenix Tail Inn of the Keep, offering to heal those who required it.</p>
