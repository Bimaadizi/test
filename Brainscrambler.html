<p>The Brainscrambler was a unique enchanted morningstar custom-made for the mercenary named Skullcrusher from the city of Phlan in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Brainscrambler was a simple-looking weapon made of solid oak wood and bound in high-quality steel . The weapon was marked by its creator.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The morning star possessed a simple +1 enchantment that enhanced the wielder's aim and improved the damage dealt. Upon each successful hit, the Brainscrambler had a chance of damaging the target's mental capabilities, draining wisdom, and leaving them disoriented and confused.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Skullcrusher commissioned the creation of the Brainscrambler from a master smith with unique specifications sometime after the mercenary's departure from Phlan in the Year of the Lion, 1340 DR . He carried the magic weapon into countless adventures and mercenary jobs across the Dragon Reach , the Dalelands , and the Moonsea until retiring in a cottage within the Neverwinter Wood . In his advanced age, Skullcrusher was willing to gift the morning star to a fellow adventurer; the mercenary thought it to be better than letting some monster or looter claim the Brainscrambler after his death.</p>
