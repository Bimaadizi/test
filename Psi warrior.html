<p>Psi warriors , also known as a psychic warriors , were individuals that harnessed the power of psionics towards augmenting their martial prowess, becoming formidable combatants of both body and mind. Some considered them to be an archetype of fighter , but their unique mixture of physical and mental training made them a match for most non-psionic fighters, potentially even outclassing them.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Psychic warriors, along with soulknives , were the second most commonly encountered form of psionics users in the Realms. Many grew up and trained in the rare secluded psion commune, small communities or societies of similarly discipline-minded individuals, as a child of psion parents that eventually grew dissatisfied with their dictates and chose a more martial path out of a sense of rebellion. Despite this rebellious origin, such psychic warriors maintained deep connections with these communes.</p>
<p>The lives of psychic warriors were defined by self-mastery, personal development, and a drive to achieve martial perfection. In contrast to psions, who focused wholly on their power over the Invisible Art. They emphasized the development of the body in rigorous training, viewing psychic power as a matter of balancing their mental and physical energies.</p>
<p>While some psychic warriors could manage to develop their powers on their own, much like psions the majority of psychic warriors required some form of schooling in order to access and increase their understanding of their psionic abilities, whether under the tutelage of a mentor or at an academy. In the Underdark , academies catering to the path of the psychic warrior could be found among a number of drow cities, such as the martial academy of Melee-Magthere in Menzoberranzan .</p>
<p>Among the greater paths of psionics, psychic warriors were among the most interested in the path of the elocater , and some warriors took interest in the fiery powers of the pyrokineticist . They were unlikely to ever pursue the path of a psion uncarnate , as they were attached to the physical nature of their being, while paths that required intense study like the cerebremancer were equally unappealing to them. Some psychic warriors were so devoted to the ideals of good and righteous that they became wonderworkers .</p>
<p>Among the psionically inclined races of Toril , the path of the psychic warrior was particularly favored among duergars , elans , ghostwise halflings , githyanki , githzerai , half-giants , and thri-kreen . Some could even be found amongst the ranks of mind flayers .</p>
<h3>Alignment</h3>
<p>The alignment of a psychic warrior could fall anywhere within the spectrum, though many tended towards a chaotic outlook, as the training required of a psychic warrior demanded putting equal weight towards what others would consider to be the polar opposites of physical and mental ability. Many were also self-proclaimed to be fearless.</p>
<h3>Regions</h3>
<p>In the Underdark, psychic warriors could be found in drow cities, in the mind flayer settlement of Ch'Chitl , and among the githyanki raiders of Gatchorof .</p>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>While a great deal of psychic warriors were not particularly religious–the common reliance on their own will tended to make them poor supplicants–those who did favored the worship of deities that were on the chaotic or neutral side of the alignment spectrum. During the time of Jhaamdath , psychic warriors within the empire typically worshiped Auppenser . Later generations of psychic warriors commonly worshiped Sardior .</p>
<p>In the 1370's DR , a small group of psychic warriors at the academy of Melee-Magthere covertly worshiped the god Selvetarm .</p>
<h3>Reputation & Relationships</h3>
<p>These martial psionicists got along well most other users of the Invisible Art and were considered a welcomed addition to most adventuring companies . Psions particularly got along well with them, the two types often engaging one another with friendly ribbing and rivalry.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Many psychic warriors took up the life of an adventurer in search of battle to further their martial skills and treasure from which to acquire better equipment.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The core defining aspect of a psychic warrior was their ability to supplement their strength, martial skills, and fighting styles with psionic powers and extraordinary feats.</p>
<p>In the years following the Second Sundering , the powers of psi warriors began to become more limited, centered around psychokinesis . Their abilities included unleashing telekinetic thrusts , creating protective shields made up of telekinetic force around themselves and others, the power of telekinesis , infusing their weapon strikes with psionic energy , and augmenting their leaps to propel their bodies into the air. And with all the training they did to bolster their minds, psi warriors were resistant to harm from psychic energy.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>As the martial masters among psionics users, these fighters could be proficient in all manner of simple and martial weapons, shields , and armors ( heavy , light , and medium ). The only exception to this prowess was tower shields , which were never wielded by a psychic warrior.</p>
<p>In terms of psionic items , much like psions they were capable of wielding power stones , crystals imprinted with one or more psionic powers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Founding Time , the most incidence of psychic warriors on the planet were in the psiocracy of Jhaamdath, which was ruled by the Bladelords , a council of psions and psychic warriors. Jhaamdathan relics would be gleamed by later generations of the Invisible Art to develop the oldest psionic traditions in recorded history.</p>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR, a group of psychic warriors went in search of the fabled alhoon Korid Takazz , but instead encountered the mad lich Zzarka Tuzarr . The group fell before her power, some having their brains devoured, and the rest made into slaves that she would send on a murderous rampage against her enemies.</p>
