<p>Martens were a species of mustelid or "weasel", a family of small mammals that included ferrets and weasels .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These animals were similar in appearance to other mustelids, being small and slender-bodied furry creatures. They measured around 2​ to ​4 feet (0.61​ to ​1.2 meters) in length and weighed around 2‒16 lb (0.91‒7.3 kg). Much like other mustelids, martens were skilled swimmers.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>These creatures were a carnivorous species.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Like other mustelids, martens could be found in a wide variety of climates, though they more commonly inhabited cooler ones. They generally preferred to avoid dense settlements.</p>
<p>In north Faerûn , they could be found in parts of the Dalelands , particularly Daggerdale and Deepingdale . In northwest Faerûn they could be found in the Silver Marches .</p>
<p>Beyond Faerûn , martens could be found across much of the continent of Kara-Tur , living in temperate forests and plains as well as tropical and sub-tropical forests.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Some wizards were known to have martens as familiars .</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>The hides of these creatures were quite valued, ranking among the most prized pelts of the Silver Marches. They were valued more than the hides of ferrets, stoats , and weasels, while they were typically valued less than those of ermines , minks , and sables , though they could fetch comparable prices.</p>
<p>The marten pelts of the Silver Marches were carried and traded all across the Sword Coast , while those of the Dalelands were traded by the Silverhand House coster to the cities of Arabel and Ordulin . In the trading posts of Everlund and Silverymoon , marten pelts could fetch anywhere from 2 to 8 gold pieces . In the further-off markets of Luskan , Neverwinter , and Waterdeep they were sold for twice those amounts. Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue sold marten hides at a flat rate of 8 gold pieces each.</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>In the church of Baervan Wildwanderer , "Marten" was one of the titles for confirmed priests , ranking directly above " Hedgehog " and below "Red Fox".</p>
