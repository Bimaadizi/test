<p>Windsong Tower was the physical location of a school of magic in the elven city of Myth Drannor . After Myth Drannor's fall, the central tower was all but razed but other portions of the school survived. As of 1376 DR , many ruins of the school still existed.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The tower consisted of a central tower, with structures in the boughs of a massive oak , structures in the boughs of the Shadowsong Tree , and extra-dimensional spaces. Entry to the school was mainly by portal using a special ring, a Windsong Towerkin ring, that served as a special portal key. By 1376 DR , the physical tower was all but destroyed and the structures in the trees were deteriorating, but the extra-dimensional spaces were generally in good condition.</p>
