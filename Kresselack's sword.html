<h2>History</h2>
<p>Centuries before 1281 DR , Kresselack's sword aided its master in his conquest of north Faerûn . The origins of the enchanted blade were lost to history. However, sages believed that the Black Wolf acquired the sword somewhere in his conquests. There were tales among the northern folk that Kresselack's sword was commissioned from a powerful wizard specifically for Kresselack.</p>
<p>Kresselack's sword rested peacefully inside its master's sarcophagus in the Black Wolf Temple of the Vale of Shadows in Icewind Dale . Kresselack's undead form was haunting the temple, which was filled with arcane defenses and undead guardians. In 1281 DR, a group of heroes was sent by Archdruid Arundel into the Vale of Shadows in order to find the looming darkness over Kuldahar . Eventually, the heroes confronted Kresselack but realized that, although he was evil, he was not the evil that threatened the town. The heroes agreed to stop a priestess of Auril , Lysan , who wanted to destroy Black Wolf Temple as it was an abomination in the eyes of her god. As a reward, the barbarian king gifted the adventurers his enchanted greatsword.</p>
