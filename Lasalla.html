<p>Lady Lasalla was a noblewoman from the City of Coin, Athkatla , the capital of Amn in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Lady Lasalla frequented an expensive and exclusive Mithrest inn in Center District 's grand Waukeen's Promenade . She found herself scoffing at the young debutant â€“ Alicia Paalater , who was being aggressively courted by predatory Count Claylan , like he did Lady Lasalla in the past. The Count spent a week with young Lady Lasalla and left her heartbroken after growing bored with her. She believed that Alicia was foolish and naive to show interest in Claylan, who was seducing and using "idiot girls" routinely while being married himself. Lasalla planned to have Count Claylan's wine to be mixed with slop water.</p>
