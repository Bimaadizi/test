<p>Hogan Underwood was a kindly-looking, elderly halfling , who was secretly a retired master thief . In 1356Â DR , at the time of Khalitarius' release, he was the owner of Happy Hogan's Igloo in the Oasis of the White Palm , and sometimes a bartender during busy evenings.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Hogan was suspicious of strangers, but loyal for life to his friends. Hogan sometimes wandered the oasis.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Among the many aliases of Hogan Underwood were: Hogan the Happy, Hogan the Huckster, Shylo Slick, Aldo Chella, Rory the Ransacker, Negel Broos, and Sedgewick Paddington the Third. Shylo Slick, in particular, was an alias recognized by a great majority of thieves.</p>
<p>Besides the bar, he owned the nearby stables. He had hired a stable boy, a chef called Cookie , and a bartender, a friendly Durpari . Rose Underwood, his niece, was visiting him and bartended at his place.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
