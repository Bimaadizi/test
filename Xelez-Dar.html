<p>Xelez-Dar was a leader of the drow who commanded minotaurs of the Storm Horn Mountains of Cormyr in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the early 1360s DR , Arelin Starbrow was killed along the High Road , ambushed by a monster horde. Her body was retrieved by valorous Sir Dutiocs . However, the Arms of the Roadwarden, the enchanted set of weapons and armor that symbolized the office, were lost to the monster attackers. Xelez-Dar's minotaurs participated in the attack and obtained the Sword of the Roadwarden . The minotaurs delivered the sword to their mistress deep within the tunnels underneath the Labyrinthine Cavern north of Skull Crag . When a group of caravan guards, who stood alongside Sir Dutiocs against a monster attack, was sent to retrieve the Sword of the Roadwarden , they hacked and slashed through the Labyrinthine Cavern, eventually confronting Xelez-Dar. In the first encounter, Xelez-Dar vanished in a cloud of darkness and left the adventurers to defend themselves against a band of drow warriors. The second encounter was on Xelez-Dar's territory. She ambushed the adventures, dropping at them from the ceiling along with her drow troops. Despite the ambush, Xelez-Dar was believed not to had survived that battle.</p>
