<p>The Northern Light was an inn in Caer-Konig , where travelers typically stayed in-between making a journey to Easthaven , Bryn Shander , or Kelvin's Cairn .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>A lantern hung by the entrance exterior, which had been enchanted decades prior to the 1480s DR by a traveling wizard . This enchantment caused it to have a perpetual glow that gradually shifted between shades of green, red, and blue. Many felt that this bore a resemblance to the northern lights , iridescent ribbons of color that occasionally filled the North 's night sky, thus giving the inn its name.</p>
<h2>Staff</h2>
<p>The innkeepers of the Northern Light were sisters Allie and Cori Shorard . Allie was the younger of the two, and the joy of the Lights. Her charm was put to good use as she was the one greeting the guests and showing them to the rooms. The older sister, Cori was a stout frowning woman who was in charge of all the inn's cooking, inventory, and provisions.</p>
<p>The sisters' differing personalities often resulted in long arguments throughout the evenings. The arguments were almost daily, like clockwork.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Iron Dwarf's Vengeance, 1485 DR , the criminals of Ship Rethnor were staying at the Northern Light during their campaign to undermine trust in Speaker Duvessa Shane of Bryn Shander .</p>
<p>Circa the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , the inn's namesake lantern was stolen, along with numerous other innocuous items in town. The perpetrators were a group of duergar searching for pieces of chardalyn , led by Nildar Sunblight .</p>
