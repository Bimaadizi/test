<p>Some time in 1492 DR , there was an altercation between the innkeeper and a member of the Shard Shunners , a gang of halfling wererats . As retribution, the gang was frequently robbing the tavern and assaulting some of its patrons. As the City Watch did not patrol the Field Ward, the Order of the Gauntlet may have sent a group of adventurers to investigate the problem.</p>
