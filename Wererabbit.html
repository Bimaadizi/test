<p>A wererabbit was type of lycanthrope that could take the form of a rabbit or a rabbit-like humanoid hybrid. They existed on Toril and in the Domains of Dread , though like all lycanthropes derived from prey animals they were very rare.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ravenloft's famed monster hunter, Rudolph van Richten , once dismissed the existence of wererabbits in his seminal work Van Richten's Guide to Werebeasts . Therein he stated that they and any other lycanthropes derived from herbivores were merely figments of imagination, born by hallucinations and drunkards. However, Van Richten himself would later claim to have once encountered in his travels what he referred to as a "werehare", a young child that would transform into a rabbit on nights of the full moon.</p>
