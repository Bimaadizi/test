<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Jaris was a pale-skinned human man with bright blonde slicked-back hair. His demeanor, clothes, and appearance all loudly advertised his wealth and complete lack of any hardships in his life.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Shortly after the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Jaris inherited a home in the Crossroad Keep on the Sword Coast North . The building was an alchemical laboratory that once belonged to Jaris's uncle. Shortly after the Crossroad Keep welcomed the Mercantile House led by Sa'Sani of Samarach , Jaris arrived at the keep but found the laboratory a mess. His uncle hoarded dangerous and volatile substances and chemicals that could easily damage the property if handled by someone unlearned. He attempted to hire a group of adventurers to handle the situation, but it was unrecorded how much damage, if any, they dealt to the alchemist's home in the process.</p>
