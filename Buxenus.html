<p>Buxenus was the second layer of Arcadia in the Great Wheel cosmology . It contained the divine realms of Azuth and Savras , as well as Heliopolis , the shared divine realm of Horus-Re , Isis , Osiris , and Ra of the Mulhorandi pantheon .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Although similar to the first layer, Abellio , with its orderly plains dotted with mountains, hills, forests, lakes and streams, Buxenus was also a highly organized war camp, training site and mustering ground for armies bent on reconquering Nemausus .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The training grounds were run by the Harmonium. Besides mustering forces to recover Nemausus from Mechanus , their secondary goal was to convert creatures of chaotic tendencies into their vision of the harmonious nature of the plane itself. By doing so forcefully, the Harmonium's success rate was very low, to the point that many of the captured creatures perished. This persistent harmful effect of the training camps slowly permeated into the plane itself, gradually shifting its identity towards neutrality. Unwittingly, the Harmonium's efforts were helping to destroy the second layer of the plane instead of recovering the already lost third layer.</p>
