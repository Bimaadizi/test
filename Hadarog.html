<p>Hadarog was the chieftain of the Spleen Eaters tribe of orcs during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was massive even for an orc, cutting a very intimidating presence.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Hadarog was a merciful leader in that he offered quick deaths to those who gave him what he desired.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>While he understood and spoke some words of Common , Hadarog sometimes chose to communicate to other races by means of a translator.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Unlike his fellow tribesmen, Hadarog wore a well-ornamented suit of plate mail armor, and wielded a massive greatsword .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was served well by his tribe's shaman , the particularly clever Glomred .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the Eye of Gruumsh was stolen by a pair of humans, in the latter half of the Year of the Nether Mountain Scrolls, 1486 DR , Hadarog and his orcs traveled across central Faerûn with the guidance of the chief orc god . They finally caught up to the thieves at the Underchasm , having a standoff upon one of the bridges that spanned the great expanse.</p>
<p>During the talks, a number of shades came forth to grab the Eye for themselves. During the battle, the cowardly Malik el Sami cut Hadarog with a dagger imbued with dark magic, killing the chieftain in an instant.</p>
