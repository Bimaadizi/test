<p>Tazmikella was a copper dragon who lived in the Bloodstone Lands .</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>Her human form was that of a rather ordinary looking, middle-aged woman with once-strawberry-blond, mostly soft-gray hair, dressed in simple clothes. She was also known to take the form of a young blond female elf, but still kept her human name. She had wide shoulders and a smallish head.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Tazmikella was considered friendly by her customers and neighboring merchants. She hated wearing clothes and couldn't understand the need of humans to hide their natural forms. To her that showed a level of shame and modesty reflective of a race that couldn't elevate itself above its apparent limitations.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the 14th century DR , Tazmikella was centuries old. She had a sister, Ilnezhara , with whom she crawled from her egg in the great deserts of Calimshan .</p>
<p>She and her sister were once approached by Zhengyi , the Witch-King, with the offer of immortality in lichdom if they served beside his conquering armies. The dragon sisters declined that offer.</p>
<p>In 1368 DR , Tazmikella owned a shop at Wall's Around in Heliogabalus called Tazmikella's Bag of Silver .</p>
<p>By 1484 DR , Tazmikella was posing as the human "Mickey," the owner of a curiosity shop called Mickey's Bag of Holding at Wall's Around in Helgabal . That year, the drow Jarlaxle approached her and her sister, requesting them to help him in the events surrounding the Darkening and the involvement of several white dragons .</p>
<p>During the Tyranny of Dragons , she was chosen as member of Protanther 's council of metallic dragons to oppose the Cult of the Dragon and Tiamat .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>In her dragon form, Tazmikella could blow a garlic -smelling breath that slowed those affected. When in her human and elf forms, Tazmikella still retained her dragon strength, being capable of stopping a frost giant 's warhammer many times her size as well as use it against it with ease, a feat that shocked many who bore witness.</p>
