<p>Plague demons were fiends that were created when creatures succumbed to the abyssal plague .</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Similar to ghoul fever , a victim infected by the abyssal plague, either through the ingestion of or contact with Voidharrow , exposure to the blood of another infected creature, or the attacks/death throes of a plague demon, could develop symptoms of the disease and transform upon their death.</p>
<p>Sometimes an infected creature would die before the infection of their body was complete. These creatures would still rise as plague demons, but they would be lesser, undead corpses.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Plague demons were under the control of the Voidharrow, the sentient remains of an Abyss located in another universe. The Voidharrow desired to spread the abyssal plague across all known worlds, including Toril . These demons had the same chaotic and destructive nature of the demons from the normal Abyss.</p>
<p>There were eight known types of plague demon:</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point in the past, worshipers of Tharizdun tried to free their god from his ancient prison in Pandemonium . Heroes from the world of Nerath , among them the deva Demascus , disrupted the ritual, but not before the cultists had released the Voidharrow from Tharizdun's prison. The Voidharrow infected the cultists and some of the heroes, turning them into the first plague demons, among them Murmur and Scour . They were sealed away by the remaining heroes, thought Murmur and Scour were sent to Toril through the Vast Gate .</p>
<p>In 1479 DR , plague demons were encountered in Akan√ªl , Luskan , Easting , and within the depths of Undermountain .</p>
