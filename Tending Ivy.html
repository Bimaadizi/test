<p>Tending Ivy was a tome of botanical knowledge from the Hand of the Seldarine before the stronghold's fall centuries before 1281 DR .</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>Tending Ivy was penned by a self-proclaimed amateur botanist who nevertheless was very familiar with ivy plants and how to care for them. The book talked about the author's rules on how to raise the healthiest ivy vine while questioning the competency and knowledge of his fellow botanists. One of the most notable parts of the book gave an example of tending for jangling bell ivy and how his fellow botanists were wrong for suggesting planting bells and blossoming garters together. Even though jangling bell ivy preferred moist soil, blossoming garters called for nearly drowning the plant with water. Unlike other scientists of his time, the author knew the difference between "moist" and "soaked" soil, and they lamented the lack of knowledge in the fellow botanical community.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tending Ivy was written and printed sometime between the citadel's construction circa 900 DR and its fall in the Battle of Seldarine's Hand . By 1281 DR , the citadel was ruined and inhabited by ghostly apparitions of its former inhabitants. One of the Elameth's Compendium copies could be found in the citadel's library curated by Custhantos , along with other rare books.</p>
