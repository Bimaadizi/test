<p>Glisena Foesmasher was the daughter of Baron Aldorn Thuragar , ruler of Ormpetarr in Sespech , in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Glisena was a young woman considered to be somewhat plain, with a face too square to be pretty. However, she had a voluptuous figure.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was naive, believing Naneth's words and that Dmetrio Extaminos loved her. However, she was courageous enough to flee her father's castle to an unknown location in order to save her unborn child, whom she loved dearly despite its mixed heritage.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By 1370 DR , Glisena was in a relationship with Dmetrio Extaminos, a yuan-ti pureblood and son of the ruler of Hlondeth , much to her father's chagrin. Aldorn was afraid their progeny might have snake-like characteristics, even though Demetrio was outwardly human. He disrupted their courtship as much as he could without a serious effort, but came to understand it was futile. He allowed Glisena to keep seeing Dmetrio to maintain relations with Hlondeth.</p>
<p>Finally, he seemed to be willing to let her marry him in order to improve the shaky relationship with Hlondeth. However, in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , she disappeared and several theories arose as to why she vanished. Her father thought she escaped, while his clerics thought she might have been kidnapped for ransom . After some investigations, she was found to have escaped to Chondalwood in order to save her unborn child, conceived with Dmetrio, from forced abortion.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to her, Naneth, who posed as a trusted midwife, offered her to escape through magical means. She was however, an agent of Sibyl , and swapped her baby with a marilith , putting her baby into Belinna , one of the castle's servants. While she was rescued from Chondalwood, she died shortly after she was given a C-section to extract the demon and her soul could not be called back to her body, since her death was of an arcane nature.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h3>Aldorn Thuragar</h3>
<p>Her relationship with her father was strained due to her relationship with Dmetrio Extaminos. He loved her dearly, but was domineering and strict, forbidding her from seeing Dmetrio ever again after he learned of her pregnancy, listing yuan-ti as untrustworthy and backstabbing. He even ordered her pregnancy to be terminated in secret. However, he did not spare any resources to rescue her and try to save her life.</p>
<h3>Dmetrio Extaminos</h3>
<p>She was madly in love with Dmetrio, with whom she had a relationship. However, she failed to see how denigrating he was, and believed he would come to save her in Chondalwood and take her with him. He cared not for her at all, as he did not try to find her when she disappeared nor changed her mind when he was told she was pregnant with his child.</p>
