<p>Shadowsponges , also known as air stealers , were notorious gargantuan sponge -like, air soaking creatures that inhabited the void of Wildspace .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These sponge-like creatures had gray, rubbery ovoid bodies, consisting of many branched air-sacs that protruded off of a central mass. These sacs were all studded with a multitude of patches that acted as sensory points, allowing them to see and "smell" air from up to a distance of 3 miles (4,800 meters) with the void of Wildspace. Their bodies were quite gargantuan in size, measuring up to 36 feet (11 meters) in length on average, though they were also known to grow beyond that.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>These creatures exhibited a semi-intellect, though when gathered together into a group their minds worked together on a high intellectual level. They never fought amongst themselves or collided with one another. They primarily focused their day to day lives around continuously absorbing air from atmospheres, though would the large, stable atmospheres of planets.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>They were vulnerable to electrical and fire -based attacks, though were impervious to harm from mere heat and would instead recover from high degrees of heat. When harmed by either electricity or fire, their bodies would expunge a thick, noxious cloud of gas. This gas would foul 40 tons (36,000,000 grams) of air within a 30 feet (9.1 meters) spherical area, gradually turning it deadly.</p>
<p>Most notably, shadowsponges were capable of reattaching any severed part of their body and could even merge with the bodies of others to create a larger shadowsponge.</p>
<p>When gathered together into a group shadowsponges were capable of gathering electrical charges and discharging them to devastating effects, equivalent to one chain lightning spell or two lightning bolts . However, merely passing through a "charged herd" on its own posed no immediate threat.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Shadowsponges fought by ramming their gargantuan bodies into foes and enveloping them. Most shadowsponges could only envelop a single human -sized creature at a time, though larger ones were capable of enveloping two at a time. Due to their porous nature victims would not suffocate while in their embrace, though they suffer the effects of their noxious gas. Whilst enveloped by a shadowsponge it was impossible to cast spells , fight with bludgeoning weaponry, or generally use ones arms. Any attempt to attack a shadowsponge would harm the enveloped victim as well. Severe harm or outright death would cause a shadowsponge to convulsively release any creatures they have enveloped.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>These creatures could often be found moving through the void of Wildspace on their own, lacking family units. Though some small shadowsponges have been observed corralling others of their kind into groups out of instinct. These groups, referred to as "herd clouds", traveled on long voyages. Herds clouds were studied with great interest by sages in the 14 th century DR.</p>
<p>They played no part in any food-chain and had no observable reproductive cycle.</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Shadowsponges exhibited a very unique and varied form of subsistence. They derived nutrients from gas, light, electrical energy, and heat energy. However, their main source of subsistence was the nutrients they derived from air.</p>
<h3>Usages</h3>
<p>Throughout the ages alchemists and spell researchers across various races studied in vain to find some use for the tissues and essence of shadowsponges. Over time, some sages and alchemists began to theorize that the essence of herd clouds could be harnessed in some manner to guard against magical electric-based attacks or even generate them. However, such experiments did not draw fruitful results. Beyond their potential usage for the magical arts, it was found that the rubbery tissue of shadowsponges was inedible.</p>
<p>Some spacefarers, however, found ways to utilize shadowsponges as portable atmospheres for prolonged voyages or offensively as air stealers. This involved trapping them within either a spacewreck or a large, sturdy spacegoing storage container and then forcibly dragging it along with their spelljammer . Those wishing to utilize shadowsponges for the latter purpose would drag them through the atmospheres of planetoids or skim the atmospheres of worlds.</p>
<p>The secondary usage involved bringing them into the atmosphere of, or into a collision course with, either a planetoid, base, or spelljammer. This particular usage was known to be utilized by enemies of the Elven Imperial Navy . In both cases a shadowsponge would absorb and store any usable air, however, the shock of this treatment would ultimately cause them to gradually die and necessitate their storage vessel being cut, lest the connection poison all of the air within a spelljammer.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>One experiment with shadowsponges involving some tinker gnome devices made to create and store energy, observed that a low-energy application of the shocking grasp spell made them release 25% of the atmosphere they had stored.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Some sages have theorized that shadowsponges were merely a stage in the lifecycle of some advanced fungoid lifeform. According to this theory, shadowsponges entered a certain state from the absorption of nutrients derived from gas and upon doing so would seek out a planet. They would enter its atmosphere, fall to its surface, and metamorphosize into spores to begin the next stage of its lifecycle.</p>
<p>However, other sages, such as Elminster of Shadowdale , have cautioned that though this theory cannot be discounted outright, no substantial evidence exists for several aspects of this theory.</p>
