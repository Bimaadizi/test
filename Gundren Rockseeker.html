<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1491 DR , the dwarf and his brothers located Wave Echo Cave, the legendary home of the Forge of Spells . He excitedly rushed back to Neverwinter to gather supplies and gear, and hire a party of adventurers to haul the equipment to Phandalin . However, Nezznar , under the guise of the Black Spider, sent orders to King Grol of the Cragmaw tribe to have the pair waylaid by those of the Cragmaw Hideout . King Grol ordered Klarg , the chief of the hideout, to have his minions carry this mission out.</p>
<p>Gundren and Sildar rode two horses across the High Road , but were ambushed and captured by the Cragmaw tribe and Gundren was taken to King Grol of Cragmaw Castle , losing the map to the mine in the process. The Black Spider sent out the doppelganger, Vyerith , to fetch the dwarf and his map. However, Grol did not wish to do so without making some coin in the process.</p>
<p>Gundren later became free and, along with his brother, Nundro, administrated the mine.</p>
