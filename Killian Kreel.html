<p>Killian Kreel was the self-exiled son of the Nanther family within Melvaunt and cleric of Loviatar .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Killian's face and body was covered in self-inflicted scars, a practice that began long before his induction into the church. He also wore a black mask at all times, not to hide these scars, but his true identity as a member of the mercantile family.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The priest was once a bright and joyous child of the Nanther family of Melvaunt, showing signs of promise within the family's business. Despite this appearance, he was prone to inflicting pain on himself and others, even torturing small animals from the neighborhood. As he grew older, this malice spread over into his professional life, a warning sign which was obvious to all but his family. As they ignored these signs of trouble, the situation grew from grave to worse however as Killian discovered the church of Loviatar, joining its ranks and forsaking his previous life.</p>
