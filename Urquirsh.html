<p>Urquirsh were a foul species of aberrations from the Far Realm that the kaorti utilized as living weapons.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Urquirsh were small, stinking sacs of flesh, entrails, and tubes suspended by long, spidery legs. It was they that produced the resin that the kaorti used as armor.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Urquirsh were almost completely mindless, but were devoted to their kaorti masters.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Urquirsh were highly nimble, as if under the freedom of movement spell at all times, and, as long as it lived, it was innately tied to the Far Realm. Urquirsh formed small rifts to their home plane periodically, and additionally used these rifts to procure their natural weapons. However, when cut off from their home plane, they were functionally harmless. Their only other defenses were a sharp stench that radiated from their bodies, able to sicken their enemies, and small claws. Possessing no eyes, they were also immune to any gaze attacks or effects that relied on sight.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Urquirsh would often conjure a spray of rubbery fluid from the Amoebic Sea, directing it toward their targets and effectively encasing them in resin, then slashing at their foes with their small claws. Alternatively, it could summon a sphere of acid within 90 feet of itself, detonating this makeshift "bomb" in the faces of its enemies. When an urquirsh died, the rift bonding it to the Far Realm would violently sever, exploding outward toward any creature near the dying aberration. Occasionally, this exploding rift would also allow another urquirsh to escape to the Material Plane .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the Quin , a sect of proud Imaskari wizards , returned to Faer√ªn from their millenia long sojourn into the Far Realm, they returned not as the humans they once were but as creatures of the Far Realm called the Kaorti. Inimical to their changed existence they brought along the urquirshs, as the resin these abominations produced could be used to create lairs, so-called cysts of Far Realm matter in which they could maintain their existence without being changed too much by the, to them, alien physiology of the Material Plane. As such the
urquirsh were of critically importance to the kaorti and to their plans.</p>
