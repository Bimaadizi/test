<p>Ravu Jhuristhen , better known by his chosen name, Oblivion , was a powerful and fearsome werewolf High Priest of Malar the Blood God from the city of Luskan in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Oblivion was a hulking but lean square-jawed human of 6 feet and 5 inches (2 meters) tall with a shaved head and wild black beard. He had piercing yellow wolf 's eyes that were permanently changed by lycanthropy .</p>
<p>In his wolf or his favorite hybrid form, his massive body was covered in pitch-black fur.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Ravu possessed wild, animalistic impulses that scared most people around him. In order to hide his nature, he learned to hide these impulses behind a stern mask of stark emotional withdrawal. That mask was dropped once battle ensued, transforming his face into a terrifying grimace of the savage glee of bloodlust. Open worshipers and preachers of other religions were always his first targets, with tearing their heads and ripping their bodies apart being Oblivion's pleasure.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>When in battle, the priest's savage nature led him to fight in melée most of the time, using a magical +2 scythe when in his humanoid shape. Because of that, he used spells that boosted his strength and protection, such as greater magic weapon , endurance , righteous might , and divine favor .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>As a High Priest, Ravu wore a set of mithral breastplate armor decorated with Malar's unholy symbol , hidden under baggy robes when not in a temple of his savage god. He carried potions of haste and potions of cure moderate wounds and wore a brooch of shielding upon his cloak of charisma .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>In his position of leadership, Oblivion acquired a small army of agents across the city that kept him well informed on the enemies of the church, and the priest himself regularly used scrying .</p>
<p>He often ventured into Luskan's markets and town squares, preaching the greatness of his deity and demanding tithes.</p>
<p>Lycanthope members of Oblivion's flock were known to hunt the homeless for sport.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ravu Jhuristhen was born in the northern city of Luskan to a family of candlemakers . He was a vicious child, bigger, stronger, and smarter than his peers, who became a bully and leader of a gang by the age of nine winters old. By the age of twelve, Ravu's parents demanded he end his unsavory lifestyle and learn the trade of candle making; in response, their son robbed and burned the shop down.</p>
<p>This act attracted the attention of numerous criminal organizations in Luskan; however, the Church of Malar had one thing to offer to Ravu—lycanthropy. The young criminal knew that lycanthropy meant power and accepted the church's invitation without hesitation. By the age of sixteen, Ravu had massacred two of the other young initiates, by the age of sixteen, six. Soon, Ravu changed his name to Oblivion, a name that meant he would be bringing oblivion to the enemies of Malar. By the age of twenty-six winters, Oblivion had reached the rank of a High Priest, earning fear and respect from his peers and lessers.</p>
