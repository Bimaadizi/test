<p>A hlang was a Chultan oval-shaped, hide shield, most common in the cities of Mezro and Port Nyanzaru .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>An oval hlang was 2 feet (0.61 meters) wide and between 4​ to ​6 feet (1.2​ to ​1.8 meters) tall. It consisted of animal hide—often dinosaur hide—fitted over a wooden frame. The shield was designed to be collapsible; the hide could easily be removed, rolled up, and used as a chair or pillow, while the frame could be folded up for easy storage.</p>
<p>A hlang was approximately equivalent to a typical large wooden shield in terms of weight and defensive capabilities.</p>
