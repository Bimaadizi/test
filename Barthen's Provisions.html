<p>Barthen's Provisions was Phandalin 's largest trading house in the early 1490s DR.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The store was located on the north side of Phandalin, and to the west of owner Elmar Barthen 's house. It was the first shop that would be seen when entering Phandalin from the Triboar Trail .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Barthen's Provisions acted as a general store, and was open from dawn until dusk. It sold low-cost trade wares, such as adventuring gear, as well as rations and other simple goods, and was perhaps the only place west of the Dessarin Valley that carried specialty skull-shaped butter from Butterskull Ranch . However, they did not sell weapons and armor or potions , but Barthen would helpfully direct interested buyers to places where they could find these. For larger orders, Barthen would supply a cart pulled by his ox Vincent to move the goods.</p>
<p>Barthen's Provisions also served as a trading hub. Clerks Ander and Thistle would unload and load carts of goods and resources that came into, or were to go out of, Phandalin via wagon. Barthen also brokered deals for large sales of livestock and similar goods, bringing together local sellers from as far south as Leilon with buyers as far afield as Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1491 DR , Gundren Rockseeker , a dwarf explorer, struck a deal to transfer a wagon full of goods from Neverwinter to Barthen's store. He hired a group of novice adventurers to transport the goods, however he himself was waylaid by goblin bandits and never made it to the trading post.</p>
<p>During this time, Barthen's Provisions also struck deals to sell dry goods and supplies to logging operations run by Tibor Wester , the half-brother of Townmaster Harbin Wester , as well as deals to sell herds of giant goats on behalf of Dagult Neverember in order to fund rebuilding efforts in Leilon .</p>
<p>The company went out of business in late 1495 DR or early 1496 DR . About five months later, the building was purchased by an unknown person who donated it to the worship of Waukeen , and it was quickly renovated into the Temple of the Coinmaiden by Ditch Fundi .</p>
