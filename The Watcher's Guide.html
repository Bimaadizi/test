<p>The Watcher's Guide was an ancient enchanted spear from the Western Heartlands of Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The weapon was dulled and weathered by time and the metal had lost its sheen. Despite that, The Watcher's Guide glowed gently with blue magical radiance. Those who held the spear could feel its old grim yet divine magic.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The magical spear possessed the Death's Promise enchantment that, upon each missed strike, activated the true strike spell that increased the wielder's chance of striking the same target.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 15 th century DR , it was stored in a sarcophagus in an ancient ruined temple dedicated to Jergal , within a heavily trapped crypt. The spear's owner was gifted The Watcher's Guide for his unyielding service and loyalty, both, in life and after death.</p>
