<p>A broadsword , or a broad sword , was a medium-sized sword used for slashing.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The definition of what a broadsword was often differed depending on the culture they were used in. However, broadswords were specifically used to slash, unlike longswords , which were used to both slash and pierce. Most of these swords had extra protection around their hilts.</p>
<p>Broadswords were roughly the same length as standard swords, but most had basket hilts or shell guards. More specifically, broadswords were heavy, had double-edged blades, and were around 3.5 feet (1.1 meters) long. The metal hilts of such swords could be used similarly to metal gauntlets . Thus, they were favored by those who were skilled in hand-to-hand combat, as well as those who utilized parrying.</p>
