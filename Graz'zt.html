<p>Graz'zt was the demon prince of pleasure, decadence, and unlimited self-indulgence, as well as the patron of corrupt authorities and tyrants who would rule by force. He ruled the 45 th , 46 th , and 47 th layers of the Abyss , known as Azzagrat or the Triple Realm. The appearance of the The Dark Prince belied the true depths of his wickedness, his existence a warning that not all that was beautiful was also good. All things were but playthings in the eyes of the Prince of Pleasure , he simply hadn't claimed them yet.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Standing 9 feet (2.7 meters) tall, Graz'zt appeared as a lithe, muscular large humanoid . His skin shone like polished obsidian and his eyes glittered with malevolent green light. He had yellowed fangs, pointed ears, and six slender fingers decorating each hand. He was sometimes described as having six small black horns half-hidden amid his thick black hair. These fiendish traits were apparent, regardless of whatever form Graz'zt chose to take. He was considered the comeliest demon in the Abyss, and dressed in the most expensive and elegant finery on the entire plane.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Graz'zt was a cruel and charismatic demon lord who focuses on his pleasure above all else. Despite this and his chaotic nature, he was collected and patient. To the point that some liken him closer to a devil rather than a demon. He understands that to see his goals come to fruition it requires not just force, but to control those who believe themselves to be at the forefront.</p>
<p>He was arrogant and enjoys the notion that he is the most cunning and intelligent being within the whole of the abyss.</p>
<p>Unlike his kin, he paid a great deal of attention to the prime material world through his spies and as one of the most comely of all the demon lords, he was known to have interacted with mortals quite often, trading favors, aid, or information with mortals only to then demand a service later on.</p>
<p>Graz'zt was a schemer and was always forming plots that would allow him to best his enemies and secure himself more power, with his ultimate goal being the complete subjugation of the abyss. He loved guile and seduction greatly and though he did not dislike war, he preferred to charm or trick his foes rather than simply beating them in combat. If provoked however, he was capable of extreme violence.</p>
<p>As the prince of pleasure, the only sin as far as he was concerned were restrictions. He was fond of procreating with humanoids who had made pacts with fiends and was one of the most notorious sources of cambions within the lower planes. He enjoyed contrasts and mismatches that others considered grotesque, while he despised kindness or moderation. Due to his insatiable appetites, The Dark Prince never went anywhere without a retinue of female monsters such as lamias , succubi , or mariliths . In contrast to his hedonism, he kept his mind clear of distractions so as to focus on claiming more land and minions. All while defeating his enemies one at a time.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Graz'zt, being one of the most powerful demons within the abyss, had an extensive list of abilities both common and unique to him. He had a vast repertoire of magical abilities at his disposal, so vast that many had assumed he was a sorcerer or wizard. Many of the magical abilities Graz'zt had at his disposal were largely based around controlling the battle field by restricting, dominating, and or destroying his foes with brutal efficiency.</p>
<p>His magic allowed him to dominate the minds of mortals; dispel powerful magic with ease; smite his foes with an empowered miasma of darkness ; or invoke intense fear with a word and sneer. His most powerful spell however, was the ability to trap the soul of any being he wished, sealing them away in a gem of his choosing.</p>
<p>However, he did not hesitate to fight in close range as he was just as dangerous. As a tanar'ri , he was resistant to most forms of energy, specifically being immune to electricity and poison , while resistant to fire, cold, and acid . He also boasted a potent resistance to magic, making spells far less effective. He also sported surprisingly effective self healing abilities. He possessed an acidic-burst bastard sword called "Angdrelve", also called the "Wave of Sorrow", which corroded the flesh of his foes and a major cloak of displacement which made hitting him all the harder. If pushed, he also possessed the ability to summon powerful demons to his side for support.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Wielding an acid -drenched greatsword in one hand and a profane tower shield in the other, the Dark Prince was incredibly skilled in close melee.</p>
<p>He did not hesitate to use his vast collection of spells, with him having a particular fondness for the spells charm person and unholy blight, using the latter to weed out good or lawful beings. During combat, he was known to use a dominate person spell on any obvious fighters, as to quickly have them turn on their allies, while inspiring fear in spellcasters to stop them from assisting those he singled out. He typically began combat by dispelling any effects that his foes were using to empower themselves. He was also known to begin combat with the spells detect thoughts and unholy aura .</p>
<p>Graz'zt preferred to fight in melee combat, using his swordplay and innate spells to overwhelm his foes. However, if he was wounded he would retreat periodically through teleportation. Quickly recovering from his wounds before returning to finish the fight.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h3>The Material Plane</h3>
<p>Although he had not yet achieved divine status, Graz'zt was worshiped on the Material Plane by many monstrous races, most notably the lamias . Many of his high priests, known as the Chosen, were female, and the rituals they performed were violent and involved themes of darkness and betrayal.</p>
<p>The Dark Prince was a deeply sexual, erotic being. He was known on many worlds only in legend, as a dark figure who visited witches and sorcerers, granting them sexual favors as well as magical powers. As a result, his female consorts had populated the multiverse with a depraved host of half-fiend children. Some learned of their father's identity and delved into the Abyss, hoping to usurp his power. His drow son, Athux , led Graz'zt's demonic army, while his daughter Thraxxia served him as his private assassin .</p>
<p>In the Year of Hordling Armies, −666 DR , Graz'zt and Ayanna Orgolath had twin half-fiendish sons, named Ulthas and Ulthar . They would overthrow the lich -king of Narfell , Belevan the Unliving , and give rise to the Orgolath Dynasty .</p>
<p>For a time, Graz'zt was trapped on the Material Plane world of Oerth by the witch-queen Iggwilv , who used his insight to elevate her own power. Eventually, however, she succumbed to the Dark Prince's charms. Graz'zt ultimately returned to the Abyss, but rumors abounded that he did, in fact, fall in love with his captor. A son, Iuz, was born of their union.</p>
<p>Some sources claimed that Graz'zt was the creator of the Vasharans, a breed of vilely evil humans . Deemed cruel and soulless by the gods who created him, the Vasharans' ancestor was destroyed... but Graz'zt breathed new life into the corpse, long before he attained his present status. It was a terrifying legacy, for the Vasharans were obsessed with deicide, and destroying all gods became the reason for their existence.</p>
<h3>The Abyss</h3>
<p>Graz'zt was always attended by six powerful lamias, and his marilith escorts, Unhath and Reluhantis , were never far from his side. Bodaks and similar horrors were found in his Argent Palace .</p>
<p>Technically, every demon living within Graz'zt's world-spanning empire was considered one of his loyal servants; those who proved otherwise were fed to the carnivorous plants in his perfumed hanging gardens. Noteworthy minions included a hulking goristro named Orwantz , who acted as Graz'zt's personal border control for Azzagrat, and Rule-of-Three , a cambion who met secretly with other fiends of the Lower Planes , to strategize an attack against the celestials.</p>
<p>Graz'zt's most powerful servant was a mysterious, hyper-intelligent demon named Verin. Like Graz'zt, Verin appeared almost human, but his skin was deathly pale, and he constantly oozed spiritual slime. Verin could change his form at will, and often created a black-skinned mirror image of himself, known as Ztefano. He served as the Dark Prince's majordomo and chief ambassador to the other demon lords.</p>
<p>The god Raxivort was once a servant of the Dark Prince. He stole powerful artifacts from Graz'zt and escaped to the howling chasms of Pandemonium , where he became the divine patron of rodents and bats. Raxivort even has his own chosen race, a goblinoid horde known as the xvarts .</p>
<h3>Enemies</h3>
<p>Through his own schemings and mischief, Graz'zt became the chief enemy of Waukeen , a goddess of wealth and merchantry. During the Time of Troubles , the deity bargained for safe passage across Zelatar with information regarding a secret horde of treasure. Graz'zt readily accepted the offer, but betrayed Waukeen as soon as she arrived in the Abyss. Imprisoned in the Argent Palace, the goddess was forced to witness profane celebrations held in her honor. A sinister group known as the League of the Six-Fingered Gentlemen (sometimes the League of Six Rings) wormed its way into the hierarchy of the church of Waukeen during the time that Graz'zt had imprisoned the goddess in the Abyss. Once there, they were not rooted out, and busily spread the Harlot's Coin Heresy among Waukeen's faithful. This heretical schism of Waukeen's faith taught that Waukeen had been gradually selling off pieces of her divinity and virtue to Graz'zt in order to finance her church and it was for failing to pay her debts that the demon lord imprisoned her. These heretics claimed that Waukeen became free because she finally paid her debt to the demon, resulting in Graz'zt owning the majority of Waukeen's godhood. The heretics thus believed that all who worshiped Waukeen were really worshiping Graz'zt instead, and they're just fine with that.</p>
<p>Graz'zt warred with many other lords of the Abyss as well, including Baphomet and Yeenoghu . Thanks to the efforts of his son Athux, he overthrew the demon prince Adimarchus , who ruled Occipitus , the 507 th layer of the Abyss.</p>
<p>One of Graz'zt's most confusing enemies was the witch queen Iggwilv (a.k.a. Tasha) . The two had been both lovers and bitter enemies over many years.</p>
<p>Two of Graz'zt's other greatest enemies were Malcanthet , Queen of the Succubi , and Gwynharwyf , champion of the eladrin . His conflict with the former ended up involving Kostchtchie , the Prince of Wrath, who swore revenge against Graz'zt for humiliating him, although Graz'zt himself did not consider the upstart demon lord as much of a threat.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>There were several competing, often contradictory theories as to Graz'zt's origin, some of which claimed that he was not a native to the Abyss, but was once an archdevil who served Asmodeus . In one of these theories, Graz'zt was chosen to lead an invasion of the Abyss as part of the Blood War —and conquered three layers of the Abyss—but became corrupted by the chaotic forces he had been sent to destroy and renounced his allegiance to the devils. Another theory claimed that Graz'zt became disillusioned with his place in Baator when he realized that the hierarchy of Hell ultimately benefited only one creature—Asmodeus—and felt that pledging his allegiance to the Abyss was the only way to place himself beyond Asmodeus's clutches.</p>
<p>Yet another theory suggested that Graz'zt was one of several demonic children of Pale Night , sired after the fall of the obyriths ; this would make him the brother of several other demons, including Lupercio , Vucarik , Rhyxali , and Zivorgian . Those who subscribed to this theory believed that Pale Night must have drawn some great evil entity to herself to father her children; suggestions for what this entity could have been included an evil god such as Set , a baernoloth , the patriarch of a race of immortal warriors from another reality, an Outer God of Crawling Chaos, and even a sentient portion of the Abyss itself. Some maintained that Asmodeus was drawn from the Nine Hells to mate with Pale Night, implying that there may be truth in both theories.</p>
<p>During the Year of the Nether Mountain Scrolls, 1486 DR , on 15 Nightal, Graz'zt was summoned to the Underdark below the Earthfast Mountains near the Master's Library , due to a ritual performed by Gromph Baenre that was originally meant to summon and bind Demogorgon , but which failed and instead summoned several Demon Lords in various locations throughout the Underdark. In this location, he subdued a force of Zhentarim .</p>
