<p>A Hunter's Guide to Hags was book dedicated to various types of hags , penned by the legendary Amandine Heartwood , a dwarvish ranger , sometime in or before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>One of the topics covered by the book was the activities and personalities of various races of hags. Despite their differences, all hags were deadly creatures, be it a night hag or a bheur . If left alive, hags were sure to leave the Prime Material plane only to return later with a vengeance. The author stated that to return, hags used a special species of spore-producing fungi unbred with the hag's essence. As long as these haggish mushrooms existed, the hag could not be killed. The mushrooms were also hard to destroy, being only vulnerable to fire.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a copy of A Hunter's Guide to Hags belonged to the Anti-Hag Support Group of Baldur's Gate , aiding their research into the hags' life cycles and the crusade against the creatures and their evil schemes.</p>
