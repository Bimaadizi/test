<p>Nchaser was a powerful mage who was famous for creating glowing globes and the spell Nchaser's glowing orb .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Nchaser's tutor in the Art was Nulathoe , from whom he learned the unique spell Nulathoe's ninemen .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nchaser was known for actively exploring the world, seeking out new magic and only twice settling down to act as an advisor for local rulers, the second time being for the High Captains of Luskan . During this stay in Luskan, he penned a spellbook known as Nchaser's Eiyromancia , which he gifted to High Captain Taerl before departing the city. The book was subsequently stolen, and would become the subject of a folk legend which claimed (not without some truth) that everyone who opened it was doomed to die.</p>
<p>He disappeared sometime before the Year of the Wandering Maiden, 1337 DR and was not seen again until the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR . Per Malchor Harpell , Nchaser was seen briefly entering into a sage's shop in Neverwinter to demand information about "the Thalang ", which he needed so as to save everyone from "the coming doom". He had seemed rather unhinged at the moment.</p>
<h3>Legacy</h3>
<p>The explorer Darnell the Unfearing claimed to have come upon a tower on an island suspended above Abeir-Toril 's north pole by a 300-foot-tall (90 meters) stalagmite of perfectly smooth ice. When he climbed up it, he reported it being surrounded by hundreds of glowing globes, which promptly shot at him as he drew closer to the top. The magical beams fired at him disintegrated the otherwise indestructible ice of the island and Darnell reportedly slid back down the ice so fast that he broke both of his legs when he reached the bottom. However, some doubted Darnell's story.</p>
<p>Apart from his glowing globes and possibly this tower, the only remaining legacy of Nchaser in the Realms were two spellbooks : his Eiyromancia as well as a collaboration with the archmage Tulrun entitled Luminescence and Coloration . His Eiyromancia found its way into the possession of the likes of High Lady Alustriel of Silverymoon and Lord Nasher Alagondar of Neverwinter, where it killed one of Nasher's courtiers. It was thus placed in Nasher's library as of the Year of the Morningstar, 1350 DR , but was stolen during one of the riots known collectively as the Five Fires Rising .</p>
