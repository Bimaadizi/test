<p>A snuffing bell , or candle snuffer , was a tool designed for snuffing out candles .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The name of this tool derived from the fact that the part placed upon candles to douse them resembled a bell . They sometimes had rods that measured 4 feet (1.2 meters) in length and weighed 4 pounds (1.8 kilograms). Some held an oiled wick at their tip, for use in lighting candles, oil , or other flammables.</p>
<p>Snuffing bells were only suitable for putting out the flame of a candle, nothing larger, and generally could not douse flames that were magical in nature, unless otherwise noted. For example, the magical candles of Istishian mystics could be doused with a snuffer.</p>
