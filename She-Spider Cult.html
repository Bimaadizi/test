<p>The She-Spider Cult was a drow religious organization based in Thay that tried to combine the worship of the evil goddesses Lolth and Shar , but ended up opposed by both deities.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>After losing the favor and divine support of both Lolth and Shar, the She-Spider Cult changed direction, becoming instead a secret criminal organization. They ran drug-running and slave trade operations in southern Thay, Mulhorand , and Unther . The Cult continued performing ritual sacrificies, but without divine support these were mostly for show, intended to thrill their followers and slay their enemies.</p>
