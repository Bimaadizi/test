<p>Centaur Bridge , also known as the Stone Village , was a small town in Turmish , just off the Halondar .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Centaur Bridge was named after a stone bridge that arched over a small pound located in the ancient deep Dancing Forest . The pond was a seasonal body of water that rose even spring and trickled away into distant sinkholes later. The town was surrounded by an ever-present, thick white mist. The town's other name, the Stone Village, came from the fact that all buildings in the Centaur Bridge made out of stone, as wood never lasted in the constant damp mist. The stone cottages where wrapped in creepers and moss . The village's stables and homes stood close to the surrounding old woods. Even though Centaur Bridge was a small village, it had several taverns.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Centaur Bridge was adjacent to Halondar, also known as the Turmway, was a road that stretched from Alagh√¥n to Hlondeth . From Centaur Bridge one road veered north towards the town of Nonthal . The south route veered far south until it reached the town of Gildenglade and the Lake of Drifting Stars .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime circa 1366 DR , the adventuring Company of the Shining Stars , backed by a wealthy Sembian , explored the the vanished mansion's cellars. Reportedly, the adventurers awoken a "great evil" that devoured all members of the troupe apart from the group's rogue - Emanuel Foreister . The survivor claimed that a deepspawn or similar beast was unleashed as the adventurers opened an ancient sarcophagus within the cellars. Following this disastrous adventure, Emanuel Foreister returned to Centaur Bridge every year to pay respect to his perished friends.</p>
<h2>Rumors and Legends</h2>
<p>Around 1370 DR , it was rumored that the tunnels beneath the vanished mansion hid vast treasure and unknowable dangers.</p>
<p>Like in many other places in the Realms, the Dancing Forest was rumored to hold undiscovered buried treasures left there by individuals on the run.</p>
<p>Another legend of a treasure told of riches hidden at the eastern end of Centaur Bridge. The treasures were believed to be hidden in a clearing only visible from horseback on a bright day and only if the rider knew where to look. Legends claimed that the clearing was haunted by a menagerie of ghostly monsters. Some sages theorized that these ghosts were spellcreations of some wizard who himself was investigating the rumors of the treasure. The clearing was also said to be the entrance to the cellars of the vanished mansion.</p>
