<p>Rimmon's Lane was a road in Mosstone that connected the northern city gate and the Drovers' Field on the north-eastern side of the town.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Rimmon's Lane's main purpose was assembling and dispersing the caravans that moved through the town of Mosstone via the long Trade Way that went through the green-filled settlement. The Lane stretched into the busy area beyond the city walls, always chuck-full of caravaners, repairmen who serviced the caravan wagons, foresters, travelers, and various outsiders.</p>
