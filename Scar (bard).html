<p>In the late 14 th century DR, or in the Year of Great Change of the Malatran calendar, Scar and his fellow bards, Absolute , Morton , and Frenchy , traveled to the village of Lion's Crossing to perform at a local festival. On their journey across the Dragon Reach, they came across a peculiar group of travelers, some of whom looked human , and some were of more exotic species, all speaking in a strange language and armed in primitive weapons compared to the common equipment found in the region. The group was heroes of the Living Jungle from the far land of Malatra who were transported to the Dragon Reach in search of a headshrinker 's artifact. With the use of a tongues spell, the groups were able to communicate. The foreigners used strange words like garuda and katanga and seemingly did not know what the beasts of burden that dragged the bards' wagon were. And the wagon itself was an alien piece of technology for the Malatrans. The bards and the Heroes of the Living Jungle parted ways after partaking in some trade.</p>
