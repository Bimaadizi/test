<p>Talona's Tears were enchanted Talonite thrown weapons, symbolic of the Mistress of Disease and Mother of All Plagues.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These small chunks of amber could fit in one's hand. These stones emanated constant buzzing sounds from their cores.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When Talona's Tear was thrown, it shattered upon impact and from its core a deadly swarm of insects was unleashed to gnaw on everything in their way. This effect was similar to a powerful version of the creeping doom spell.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>One of Talona's Tears was hidden deep inside a vault of the Temple of Bhaal in the town of Liam's Hold , later known as the Stronghold . The wondrous Talonite item was deposited there sometime before the temple's fall and abandonment during the Time of Troubles . As of 1372 DR , the Tear was still locked behind the vault's hidden door and guarded by three gargoyles .</p>
