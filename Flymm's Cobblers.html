<p>Flymm's Cobblers was a small shoe shop located in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate , run by Sally and Dravo Flymm in the mid-to-late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Flymm's Cobblers was located not far from Beehive Goods and Wares and the Crimson Draughts shops.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The building opened into a small shop where the Flymm greeted customers and displayed its wide selection of footwear. The same room served as a workshop, and it held the couple's inventory and ledgers. In the 15 th century DR, the Portrait of Gortash was hung above the counter, displaying the "proud parents" spawn in a masterful stroke of paint. A set of stair led from the shop's main room up to the second floor, where the Flymm family's living quarters were located.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Flymm's Cobblers was a small and struggling business. At some point, the owners ran into serious debt, owing money to multiple parties, including some vicious loan sharks who threatened to torch the store. Out of desperation, the Flymms sold their young son Enver's services to a warlock , earning a hefty sum that secured the shop and their couple's safety. For quite some time, the shop remained in business until years later, when Enver Flymm, now using the alias of Enver Gortash, made a fortune by smuggling weapons. His ambition led the arms dealer to become one of the three leaders of the Cult of the Absolute , assembling an army of brainwashed servants, many of whom were infected with altered mind flayer tadpoles. While unsavory activities were hidden, Enver rose in prominence in Baldur's Gate, becoming a lord. Still bitter over his parents' actions, Gortash stormed into Flymm's Cobblers and infected his parents with mind-altering parasites. These tadpoles, however, were different; instead of brainwashing them, the creatures dominated the Flymms. Sally was happy and eager, running the business and praising her beloved son for becoming a Lord, all while her true self was locked inside her mind, unable to do much but watch her body being puppeteered by the parasite. Sally's husband, Dravo, was faced with an even darker fate.</p>
<p>Sometime in or just before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , presumably, before the Flymm's were enslaved by their son, Flymm's Cobblers received a huge order of twenty-six scout boots for the Flaming Fist mercenary company of Baldur's Gate. The order demanded a timely delivery of the boots to the Wyrm's Rock at the end of the same tenday . One of the Flymms annotated the order with: " Tymora 's tits, we'll never get this done in time!... I mean, how generous."</p>
