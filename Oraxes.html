<p>When Chessenta went to war with Threskel in 1479 DR , Oraxes fought alongside the Brotherhood of the Griffon .

When wyrmkeepers from the Church of Tiamat showed up at the Brotherhood's encampment, he used an illusion to make them believe he was Aoth. The wyrmkeepers saw through the disguise and captured both Oraxes and Meralaine. They managed to escape, killing several wyrmkeepers in the process.</p>
