<p>The First Light was a legendary holy undead bane longsword among the faithful of Lathander . The sword belonged to Commander Lyssic of Myth Drannor before the Weeping War destroyed the City of Song.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The First Light was a longsword that shone with Lathander's holy light.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The First Light had a keen blade, designed to deal devastating critical damage to its targets, as well as divine enchantments to destroy the undead.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the glory days of Myth Drannor, the First Light was gifted to the human Commander of the city's military, Lyssic, a respected worshiper of Lathander. The temple of the Mominglord knew that Lyssic would use the holy weapon to smite the evil and promote good in the land. With time passing, many of the soldiers under his command were interred inside a well-crafted crypt in the Polyandrium , and eventually Lyssic himself was put to rest in the same mausoleum. The commander wielded the holy relic for thirty years until he was slain in the Year of the Lost Lance, 712 DR .</p>
<p>Even though it was a common belief among sages that Lyssic was prophesied to rise again and battle evil on behalf of his deity, however, it was unclear on the circumstances and the time. The mausoleum was breached a few times since the fall of Myth Drannor, but the crypt's defenders, traps, and risen undead soldiers, once under Lyssic's command, repelled the intruders.</p>
<p>In 1369 DR , the First Light was still within Lyssic's Crypt in the Polyandrium, encased in glass and floating within a jet of blue divine flame. Said flame had similar effects to the magic circle against evil , protecting the weapon from evil-aligned creatures and extraplanar beings. Only worshipers of Lathander could safely remove the sword from the flames.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>The First Light was well-known among clerics and temples of Lathander and most were ready to pay a hefty sum to have the artifact returned to the hands of the Morninglord's devotees.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>A sword, similar to the First Light , could be created by a good-aligned experienced crafter of magic arms and armor with use of the holy smite , keen edge , and summon monster I spells .</p>
