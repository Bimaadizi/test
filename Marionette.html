<h2>Notable Marionettes</h2>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On Toril , marionettes could be found as far back as the Empire of Netheril , where those skilled in using them could be found as members of the League of Noted Singers and Performers . A notable puppeteer of marionettes during this time was the archwizard Halavar , who created a magical item with engravings of marionettes that allowed him to effortlessly reproduce the ones he owned.</p>
<p>In the mid–14 th century DR , one could make special orders for marionettes from the Stringpullers guild of Saerloon .</p>
<p>During this same time, Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue sold a wide variety of marionettes, which they marketed as a tool for bards . The marionettes that they sold resembled variously bards, crones, cutpurses , farmers, herdsmen, kings and queens, mages , maidens, merchants, mothers, noblemen, orcs , peasants, priests , princes and princesses, skeletons , slaves , and soldiers. They also sold dragon marionettes, made of silk from Shou Lung , that required three hands to operate. By the late 15 th century DR, these dragon marionettes were also produced in the Faerûnian state of Nathlan .</p>
<p>When the warmage Aoth Fezim was affected by the Spellplague , he saw an illusory image of Bareris Anskuld dangling a marionette that resembled himself, twitching its strings to make it dance.</p>
