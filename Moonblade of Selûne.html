<p>Moonblades of Selûne were enchanted longswords gifted to the priestesses of Selûne for going above and beyond in service of their church .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The blades of these magic swords were made of strange translucent pale-white material that gently glowed in the dark. To a casual observer, the edges were dull; however, when swung in combat, a Moonblade of Selûne proved to be a deadly weapon that cut its opponents with magic.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These powerful blades passed through armor and attacked the target's flesh directly through magic. This effect was similar to that of a +4 enchantment. Moonblades drained the life out of the targets and left no visible wounds. Additionally, Moonblades of Selûne were devastatingly deadly to undead creatures as the weapons boiled away the creatures' essence.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the early 14 th century DR , Moonblades of Selûne were rare gifts to the priestess of Selûne who committed themselves fully to the creed of the Moonmaiden and served beyond the duty to the faith. One notable welder of the such blade was Emma Moonblade , who settled in the wilderness outside the Shaengarne Ford in Icewind Dale . In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , the priestess' enemy, the troll Vrek Vileclaw , ambushed her during a battle against orcs of the Legion of the Chimera and stole the Moonblade . Emma implored a group of mercenaries from Targos to recover the blade.</p>
