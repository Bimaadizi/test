<p>Malkur Forrin was a military commander in Sembia in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Malkur was a tall man with grey hair and a mustache. He had many scars on his arms and his right eye drooped because of an old wound.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Malkur was only interested in coin. He was ambitious and amoral.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Malkur was a general of the Sembian army until he was dismissed by Kendrick Selkirk for his excessive brutality. He then decided to create his personal mercenary army, the Blades . Often he worked as an escort for the Six Coffers Market Priakos caravans and for more darker jobs.</p>
<p>On Marpenoth 29 of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , after the start of the fighting between forces loyal to temporary Overmistress Mirabeta Selkirk and those loyal to Endren Corrinthal of Saerb , Mirabeta and her niece Elyril Hraven summoned Malkur to Mirabeta's mansion of Ravenholme . They asked that his army attack the Saerloon delegation while posing as men from Selgaunt and Saerb and in exchange Mirabeta promised him much money and the position of commander general of the Sembian army. In addition, Mirabeta hired him to kill Miklos Selkirk and Kavin Selkirk .</p>
<p>Malkur and his men located the position of Miklos and Kavin through divinations and, on Uktar 1 , ambushed them. After fierce fighting, Malkur's men managed to kill the two Selkirk brothers. Meanwhile, Malkur's disguised men quickly and efficiently attacked the Saerloon delegation.</p>
<p>However, on Uktar 5 , Malkur led a contingent to attack the Selgaunt delegation, composed of new hulorn Thamalon Uskevren II , Erevis Cale , and their companions. But thanks to the timely arrival of troops from Saerb led by Abelar Corrinthal , the attack failed and Malkur retreated.</p>
<p>On Uktar 11 , Mirabeta reproached Malkur for his failure against Selgaunt but appointed him Commander General with orders to attack Saerb immediately and destroy it.</p>
<p>After some of his troops destroyed the Corrinthal Estate and took prisoner Abelar's son Elden Corrinthal , Malkur delivered his orders for the attack on Saerb the next day, on Uktar 29 : make an example of the town, destroying and killing everyone and sacking anything of value. On Uktar 30 , Malkur Forrin led the Sembian army to attack Saerb in northern Sembia, setting the town ablaze.</p>
<p>On Nightal 1 , at Abelar's request, Erevis Cale and Drasek Riven infiltrated Forrin's camp to rescue Elden and capture Malkur. Cale first healed Elden and took him to safety. Afterward, with his spells , Cale kidnapped Forrin and took him to the ruin of the Corrinthal Estate, where Abelar was waiting. After a furious duel, Abelar killed Malkur Forrin as he surrendered.</p>
<p>The next day, Malkur's army assembled to avenge his abduction with an attack against the Saerbians' camp near Lake Veladon . But they incautiously entered the just-formed Shadowstorm and they were all killed and turned into undead .</p>
