<p>Morglord lltriune , called "the Magister Morglord", was a wizard of Sheirtalar in Lapaliiya of the 6 th century DR and the Magister from 522 DR to 527 DR , and afterward a sentient gate somewhere in the Realms.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Morglord appeared shy and forever lost in his thoughts, yet if disturbed he would be annoyed and glare dangerously at whoever had interrupted him. He usually stood so still and silently that others easily overlooked him. However, his habits were but an affection, hiding a coolly calculating individual. He was a gifted mage and a masterful multi-tasker, said to be able to hold a polite conversation, scry on events from afar, analyze in depth the news he received, fully contemplate his own deeds and plans, and wage a spell -battle, all at the same time.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was tall, dark, and slender.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He was the product of an old and proud family of Sheirtalar, but held little promise before he happened to slay the current Magister, the dangerously erratic and spontaneously spell-hurling Thardon Ilvynner in the Year of the Unmasked Traitor, 522 DR . After that, he became the next Magister.</p>
<p>During this tenure, Morglord invented a number of spells that employed extradimensional spaces and others that altered the dimensions of objects and creatures, which continued to be used into the mid-1300s DR . He grew ever more fascinated by the beauty of magic in all its forms, but also disgusted by the selfishness and lack of effort of his fellow wizards, especially human ones.</p>
<p>Ultimately, in the Year of Tatters, 527 DR , he felt he could no longer serve other wizards as Magister and, lest he begin destroying them arbitrarily, he beseeched Mystra to release him from his service and all contact with human wizards. She gave him Mystra's Choice , and he chose to turn himself into a gate . He was succeeded as Magister by Tsjancy Yildree .</p>
<p>Over the following centuries, Morglord just quietly observed the world of magic and mages as they passed through his gate . However, it seems he might've grown bored, or mad, or both, or merely whimsical, for random magic sometimes burst from gates across Faer√ªn . The notion of a sentient and hostile gate greatly concerned, or at least irritated, archmages like Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As a gate , Morglord was a conduit linking two fixed portal s and permitting instant travel between them. From those who passed through, he stole and fed upon the vitality, memorized spells, and magical energy (such as magical item charges) by some unknown mechanism.</p>
<p>However, it was unknown which gate he was, and Mystra declined to reveal it. Morglord was theorized to be one near, in, or under Waterdeep , maybe one that went within Undermountain .</p>
