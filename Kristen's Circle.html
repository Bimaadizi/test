<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in the late 14 th century DR , Kristen's Circle was the startling site of a murder. Early one morning, two City Guardsmen discovered the corpses of four priests chained together at the junction's center. They were identified as each being acolytes of a different faith: Helm , Lathander , Tempus , and Tyr . Pinned to one of the bodies was a note that read, "Gods sleep while Checkmate stirs". The incident was reported the next day by the Ravens Bluff Trumpeter broadsheet , though the City Watch were withholding details at that time.</p>
