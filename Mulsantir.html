<p>Mulsantir was a great and prosperous city in southwest Rashemen . Its position as a coastal town at the end of a prominent trade route, the Golden Way , aided in its status as a major mercantile destination in the region.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Unlike many of Rashemen's towns and cities, Mulsantir featured buildings of rough stone built entirely atop the earth, separated by wide dirt streets that turned to dirt and froze every winter. The town's structures stood in harmony with nature. Its rugged dirt roads were often bustling with the activity of trade and commerce. It was encircled by fearsome angular walls or shining gray stone.</p>
<p>Its prominence often made it a target for invasions from the nation of Thay to the south.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It was located at the end of the Golden Way, at the northern shore of the River Mulsantir , just west of Lake Mulsantir . In summer months, ferries operated out of Mulsantir, allowing for easy crossing of the River Mulsantir by individuals and caravans alike.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Like other settlements of Rashemen, Mulsantir was governed by a fyrra , a local war leader who acted as a mayor and was the exclusive commander of the town's armed forces. Circa 1368 DR , Mulsantir was governed by Lord Thorbinn the Black from his estate on the Green Hag Hill , who, in turn, was advised by a wychlaran. Lord Thorbinn's advisor was Shialis in the mid-14 th century DR. By 1372 DR , the rulership of Mulsantir passed to the urphong , a title similar to that of a mayor, Brak Keldurr and his advisor, othlor Sheva Whitefeather .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Mercantile traffic in Mulsantir was abundant as caravan workers and traders moved goods into the city via the Golden Way, and ferries transported them across the river to Ashanath . During the cold months of the year, the waters iced over, and caravans could cross overland unimpeded.</p>
<p>A small fleet of fisher boats called feluccas netted sturgeon from the nearby lake and farmers and ranchers from the surrounding land sold them as food to the caravans that passed through Mulsantir. Mulsantir used Rashemaar ponies , a preferred winter mount to normal horses . Ponies were strapped into Rashemaar sleighs , carrying travelers across the neighboring lands.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The city was protected by extensive solid stone walls that were originally erected by the city's witches and remained undamaged by countless southern siege engines and Red Wizard spells. It was defended by the Urphong's Host , a military force that numbered over 400 barbarians and warriors. It was known to house at least one lodge of Rashemaar berserkers, those from the fearsome Ice Troll lodge . By the late 15 th century DR, Mulsantir transformed some of its witchboats into magic warships.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mulsantir grew from a provisioning stop at a busy trade crossroads on the Golden Way and Lake Ashane.</p>
<p>By the mid-14 th century DR, Mulsantir had a long history of weathering sieges of the much hated Thayan neighbors, counting five major blockades, each time broken and pushed back by the strength of the Rashemaar berserkers and the powerful Wychlaran .</p>
<p>The city suffered severe flooding in the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR , after Thayan Red Wizards melted glaciers in the Icerim Mountains .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , Rashemen completed the road between Mulsantir and Tinner .</p>
<p>The next year, the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Thayan agents started a wildfire in the western Ashenwood to send wild creatures towards inhabited Rashemaar areas to sow chaos. Additionally, the Red Wizards teleported bands of cutthroats into Mulsantir to assassinate important local figures, but the Rashemi slew the invaders, restoring peace.</p>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , a Thayan emissary named Khalia arrived in Mulsantir desiring the creation of a Thayan enclave. She was refused permission but was allowed to leave the city alive. Around that same time, the tharchions Homen Odesseiron and Azhir Kren both gathered their armies and planned to seize Mulsantir for the glory of Thay.</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Mulsantir was briefly besieged by the god of bears and an ancient telthor of Rashemen – Okku , and his army of spirits. The Barrow of the Bear-God was disturbed by a hero known as Kalach-Cha , who mysteriously found themselves transported there after a fierce battle with the King of Shadows on the other side of the continent. The Bear God demanded the city to give up the trespasser of face his wrath. By the means of Kalach-Cha's violence or negotiations, Okku's threat was eventually lifted.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Mulsantir successfully weathered three more Thayan sieges.</p>
