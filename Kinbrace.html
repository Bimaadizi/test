<p>Kinbrace was an important farming town found in western Soravia in Damara .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Kinbrace rested on the eastern banks of the Galena Snake near Soravia's border with Morov . The town and surrounding communities covered nearly 25 mi² (65 km²) of fertile farming land that was vital for the duchy.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>One feature that made Kinbrace different than most other towns and cities in the Bloodstone Lands was its lack of a protective wall. Instead, Kinbrace used a series of six strategically placed castles, each controlled by a wealthy landowner, for its defense system. These landowners generally worked together, suffering through the occasional feud, for the collective benefit of the region.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Witch King took advantage of a period of shortsightedness between these wealthy landowners during his invasion of this area of Damara, naming Kinbrace as his capital in Soravia. Zhengyi installed a puppet-king to rule in his stead, who was quickly overthrown with the Witch-King's fall.</p>
