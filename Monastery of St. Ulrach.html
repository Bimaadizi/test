<p>The Monastery of St. Ulrach was a monastery dedicated to Ilmater , the Crying God, in the Delimbiyr Vale in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It was located some two days' ride south of the city of Loudwater , on the eastern edge of the Southwood forest.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The monastery resembled a fortress and stood on a rocky crag overlooking a winding creek. Around the crag's base and along the creek was a thorp called St. Ulrach.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The monastery was built by a local Ilmatari saint known as St. Ulrach the Twice Martyred . He earned his appellation when he died, for the second time, in defense of the Delimbiyr Vale against marauding hobgoblins commanded by a cornugon circa 1363 DR .</p>
<p>With his sacrifice and sainthood, Ulrach's small monastic order swelled. They remained active almost a decade later, around 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The monks' teachings were focused on finding strength in suffering and in the holy nature of working the earth and living a simple life. The monks grew plants and herbs . Evendur Olvebranch , a local sage, came to the monastery occasionally to collect some special herbs.</p>
<p>The monks visited Loudwater to tend to Tragedy's Grotto , a shrine to Ilmater with a statue of St. Ulrach. They came regularly but not frequently.</p>
