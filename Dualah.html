<p>Dualah was a female human cleric of Umberlee in Hillsfar in 1367 DR . She tended to the shrine of Umberlee there.</p>
<p>Lord Maalthiir seemed interested in her â€” according to a rumour, they were romantically involved. However, Dualah was a follower of Mordak Brelliar , Maalthiir's apprentice, who tried to use this to his advantage, to gain information on Maalthiir. Dualah knew nothing about these plots.</p>
