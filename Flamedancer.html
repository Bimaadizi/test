<p>Flamedancer was a name used by a tshala that dwelt in the Flaming Brazier temple in Bezantur as of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR and worked to undermine the Church of Kossuth from within.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It appeared as a fey of living fire . It was capable of casting several very powerful spells .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Flamedancer was motivated by a desire for revenge. Unlike most tshala, this motivation stopped it from becoming distracted from its mission of infiltrating the Flaming Brazier.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Flamedancer was a member of the Harpers , and was considered to be one of the most unusual Harpers in all of Faerûn . It was one of only two active Harper spies in Bezantur as of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, the other being Ruvya .</p>
<p>The high priest of the Flaming Brazier, Eternal Flame Mythalanir , regarded Flamedancer's presence in his temple as a sign of Kossuth 's favor, and treated it as an honored resident. While Flamedancer was not the only firetail to visit the Flaming Brazier, it was the only one that chose to stay for any length of time. However, the tshala in truth held a deep grudge against that god and his Thayan followers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Flameedancer considered the Yuirwood to be its ancestral home, where it had long been a companion to the seelie fey. It was favored among these sprites despite being a dangerous creature of fire because it helped to control old growth and to renew the forest with carefully managed wildfires. Prior to the mid–14 th century DR, Flamedancer had also made the acquaintance of Galvin of Aglarond , a member of the Harpers with experience fighting against Thay.</p>
<p>During the Salamander War of the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , fire elementals allied with Thay burned much of Flamedancer's home and killed its seelie companions. The tshala swore revenge, and so contacted Galvin for aid. Galvin and the Harpers suggested that it infiltrate the Flaming Brazier in order to spy on the Kossuthans and the Red Wizards , reasoning that it could do so without arousing much suspicion. To their surprise, it not only agreed to settle in as an occupant of the temple, but it continued to work as their spy for over a decade. By 1370 DR , Flamedancer had successfully freed several slaves and its reports back to the Harpers had contributed to the thwarting of more than one Red Wizard scheme.</p>
