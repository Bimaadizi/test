<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Slabhead, like his kin, looked like a giant humanoid of muscular build, much larger than his kin. He had a large bulging forehead that gave him an especially brutal brutish look and small porcine eyes. Despite his appearance, Slabhead's speech was quite eloquent, for a verbeeg.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Slabhead wielded his favorite weapon : the greatclub he called the Facemelter .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Mirtul of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Slabhead lead a tribe of verbeeg to the town of Termalaine , after it was evacuated. The town was blasted by blizzards of deadly unnatural winter and only creatures of cold could survive. Slabhead allied with Arctus, a blue-skinned chosen and son of Auril . Slabhead forces were boosted by snow trolls , winter wolves , and winter hags who served Arctus. Once the town was seized, Slabhead took the town hall as his base, until he was slain by the Hero of Neverwinter just mere days later.</p>
