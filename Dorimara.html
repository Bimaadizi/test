<p>Dorimara was the daughter of Bubbles Tefoco and granddaughter of Oliver Tefoco , the proprietor of the Beehive Goods and Wares general store in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dorimara was born in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , as the Cult of the Absolute threatened Baldur's Gate's safety. Still a newborn, she resided in the Stonyeyes neighborhood with her mother. Dorimara became the first grandchild of Oliver Tefoco, who, as the city became closed off in fear of the cultists, was worried about visiting because of the closed city gates and of burdening his daughter, who had just given birth. Instead, Oliver sent his daughter a letter with several jingling coins , asking Bubbles to buy Dorimara a cute hat from her Pop-pop.</p>
