<p>The Tome of the Creed Resolute was a magical book recording the Creed Resolute and the names of citizens of Elturel who'd sworn an oath to follow it by 1494 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The book was bound in leather. The first page displayed the text of the oath. The remaining pages were taken up the names of those who'd sworn it, all in the same handwriting. New pages would appear as necessary to hold more names.</p>
<h2>Use</h2>
<p>Elturian citizens who were old enough to read were required to put a hand on the Tome of the Creed Resolute and recite the oath, swearing to defend Elturel among other services. Once done, their name magically appeared in the book, thus recording all those who'd sworn to follow the Creed.</p>
<p>The Tome of the Creed Resolute was kept at the High Hall 's cathedral in Elturel.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After 1489 DR , High Overseer Thavius Kreeg made all Elturians swear to follow the Creed Resolute, making them oathbound to defend Elturel, but in the process binding the whole population to the city and to his deal with the archdevil Zariel , which included the city's "oathbound defenders". The names of those who swore the oath were recorded in the Tome of the Creed Resolute . After the deal was concluded Elturel was transported to Avernus , first layer of the Nine Hells , in the Year of Twelve Warnings, 1494 DR . However, the book itself was unimportant; destroying it would not break the oaths, nor Zariel's hold on the Elturians' souls.</p>
<p>When the High Hall was overrun by devils , an acolyte named Pherria Jynks took the Tome of the Creed Resolute from the cathedral down into the main crypts to safeguard it. There she waited with over a hundred other survivors until help came.</p>
