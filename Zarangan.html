<p>A zarangan was a smooth, magical stone, shaped to fit in the palm of a hand that granted several spell -like abilities and could serve as a +1 melee weapon. In the years circa 1372 DR , they were most often found in Halruaa .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The main abilities these artifacts granted were impressive. They allowed anyone holding the stone to cast dimension door almost at-will, cast cure critical wounds once per day and, upon uttering a command word utilize an ability that worked like the spell word of recall , once per day, to return to a home location that was designated upon the stone's creation. These pre-determined locations had remained linked to the stones for centuries, so anyone using this ability in the modern era might end up in the abandoned ruins of some long-dead Halruaan wizard 's sanctum or lich 's tomb.</p>
<p>Because they were made with a specific magic-user in mind, zarangans were highly customized. In addition to these main abilities, they granted spell immunity against a few spells and allowed the wielder to cast one of either chain lightning , cone of cold , lesser ironguard , levitate , unseen servant or water breathing once per hour.</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>Zarangans were made from smooth stones, cut to form-fit to the hand of its user and polished until they had a vitreous shine. They had protrusions along one side that slid between the magic-user's fingers. The command word, used to activate the stone's recall ability was often etched into the sheer surface.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These artifacts were a remnant of ancient Netheril , having been brought to Halruaa after its fall.</p>
