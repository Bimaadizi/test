<p>Mikhael Jarvin was a Cormyrean Purple Dragon who served in the town of Eveningstar in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Aeron was a human man with a gray beard and long hair tied into a ponytail.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar , Mikhael was recovering in the Eveningstar War Hospital when Peron Uthe arrived for treatment. Peron was infected with a strange disease passed from the druid Halsaime , which turned him into a red musk zombie and began spreading to the other patients. Mikhael was among those infected, and eventually transformed into a zombie before being destroyed when the hospital was cleansed. A sample from his body was used by head priest Hurim Jaskyr to create an inoculation against Peron's infection, allowing the fallen ranger to finally be destroyed.</p>
