<h2>History</h2>
<p>On Kythorn 10 , Celedon Kierney had given Sergor and his co-conspirers a place close to the king because of their unusual success at gathering intelligence from the Bandit Army of Vaasa .</p>
<p>Sergor Marsk was part of the forces led by king Gareth Dragonsbane in Mirtul 3 of 1373 DR to fight off a dragonflight roused by the Rage of Dragons . He used the cover of battle to lead a rite which trapped the king's soul; only the timely intervention by a young soldier, Igan , prevented his treachery from being completely hidden. Igan slew Sergor immediately.</p>
