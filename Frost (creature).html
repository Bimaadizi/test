<p>Frosts , also known as snow fairies and winter folk , were distant cousins of pixies and sprites .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Frosts were small, fey -like creatures with wings that looked an insects. Most had pale blue skin, although frosts who lived in subarctic climates had dark blue skin.</p>

<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Frosts had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of cone of cold three times per day, frost fingers twice per day, ice hands and control temperature, 10' radius at will. Some frosts had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of the cold ray spell. Frosts were immune to the cold and any cold-based effects and spells.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Frosts hunted small animals by using bows and special daggers of sharp icicles. Frosts never engaged in melee combat with creatures larger than they were. If forced into combat with a larger creature, frosts kept their distance and used their innate magic abilities as weapons. Frosts avoided fire as it could instantly melt their wings, which did not grow back.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Frosts were communal creatures and lived in small villages. They were nomadic so they made their villages within abandoned animal dens, hollow trees or small caves. Frosts rarely stayed in the same location for more than a year. Frosts spoke their own language as well as elven and the languages of their local allies. Frost villages formed small scouting groups, who went out to hunt for crystals and gems , which were highly sought after. Frost lived in peace their forest and had little negative effect on their environment.</p>

Frosts harassed humans who exploited a forests, such as loggers and hunters. Frosts were hostile towards small evil creatures such as quicklings .</p>
<p>Frosts sometimes acted as servants of Aerdrie Faenya and Ulutiu .</p>
<h3>Usages</h3>
<p>Some evil sorcerers have experimented on frosts to determine if any part of their bodies could be used as material components for potions or spells.</p>
