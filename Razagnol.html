<p>Razagnol was a powerful glabrezu demon accidentally summoned in the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the Shadovar of Thultanthar reassembled the Abyssal Planus Mechanus Nether Scroll at Granwell Keep , one of the attendant arcanists fell to temptation and intuitively attempted to manipulate its magical powers. Unfortunately for all involved, this resulted in a portal to the Abyss opening in the Keep, letting Razagnol step through. He gloated for a moment at the terrified Primes, then ushered in a horde of dretches that rained from the sky around him. Despite the local apocalypse and Razagnol's own power, the ultimate victors were the forces of the Harpers , who defeated the Shadovar and banished Razagnol. They were then joined by Rina Belostos and Elminster , who took the Nether Scroll away for safekeeping.</p>
