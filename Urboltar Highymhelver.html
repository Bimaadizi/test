<h2>History</h2>
<p>At the time of slaying the previous Magister , Urboltar schemed to control Faerün by compelling hordes of orcs to destroy whatever stood in his way.</p>
<p>Before his schemes could come to fruition, however, he came into possession of an enchanted full-body mirror. The visions in the mirror, those of three black cloaked figures with flowing, changing, elongated limbs, haunted him for the rest of his days, rendering all his nights sleepless. He was wracked by hallucinations and rendered an erratic, irresponsive, dangerous wreck. He murmured when found by Tyvbolt Arsurath and screamed, but did not fight back.</p>
