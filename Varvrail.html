<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The family enjoyed great wealth by making investments and also smuggling between Westgate and Suzail. After being found out, they earned their livings as mere shopkeepers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At the height of their successes, the Varvrails bought a stretch of land with farms south of Thunderstone , intending to build a grand manor for the family called Varvrail Hall. Before construction could proceed, their crimes were revealed and their investments turned sour, sending several members to prison and leaving the rest with much-reduced means. Their assets were seized and sold to pay their debts, and the abandoned building site was named Folly Hall by the locals.</p>
