<p>Follgast was an elven agent of the Zhentarim in the city of Baldur's Gate in the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Follgast was a tall and strong-looking elven man with dark skin tone and short curly golden hair. He wore ornate leather armor and wielded a longbow .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Follgast's father was a shady individual who was either a member of the infamous Guild or was associated with the guildhall before the leadership was taken over by Nine-Fingers Keene . As of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Follgast worked under ranking Zhents Roah Moonglow and Friol , forging sticky alliances with the Guild and the Cult of the Absolute alike. The Guild began suffering losses at the hands of the Stone Lord , so Nine-Fingers rolled dice and hired Zhentarim agents as muscle. Follgast was among the Zhents stationed within the Guild's Guildhall in the city's Undercellar . Nine-Fingers, however, did not know that Roah and Friol planned a betrayal. Taking out the Guild meant establishing a Zhentish presence in Baldur's Gate. With the city shuddering under the cult's attack, the struggle's outcome and Follgast's fate remained unconfirmed.</p>
