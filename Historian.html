<p>The Historian was an enigmatic ape who recorded events from the Whamite Isles in the Sea of Fallen Stars .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Historian used a special mechanical device similar to a printing press to chronicle history. From their desk, they wrote a record of a series of wild conflicts between various nations and pirates of the Whamite Isles at some point prior to the mass death of the population in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR .</p>
<p>By writing history, their device gave them a seemingly magic ability to 'freeze time' and stop conflict on the Whamite Isles.</p>
