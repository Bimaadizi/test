<p>Riftel Farsight was a half-elf mage who lived in the city of Neverwinter during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As part of her scholarly pursuits, Riftel studied elemental weevils that she found on the slopes of Mount Hotenow .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Riftel had an assistant named Gerad Kinesward , whom she tasked with her more mundane activities. She felt Gerad would do well to gain some real-life experience and learn to get herself out of difficult situations such as those she sent her into.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the siege of Neverwinter , in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Riftel set herself up at an outpost of the Neverwinter Guard in the River District , which had been taken over by the Many-Arrows orcs . Riftel wanted to begin a parlay with Hulgen , the leader of the Proudfist half-orc tribe, and convince them to side with Neverwinter over the kingdom of Many-Arrows. However, she felt her shyness dealing with them made her appear weak and distrusted, so she requested a half-elf adventurer to find and negotiate with them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Riftel lost six of her elemental weevils and naturally sent Gerad to recover them, though she became frightened and hid amidst the orc camp.</p>
