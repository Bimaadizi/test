<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Battle of the Pillars of Woe</h3>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the Menzoberranyr Army of the Black Spider and the duergar armies of Gracklstugh (under the command of Horgar Steelshadow and the aid of Nimor Imphraezl of the Jaezred Chaulssin ) fought their first battle at the Pillars of Woe. It turned out to be an ambush; the duergar were already there when the drow arrived, as was the tanarukk army of Kaanyr Vhok 's Scourged Legion , which turned on the drow. At the beginning of the battle, the contingent of House Agrach Dyrr also turned against their fellows. The drow army suffered high losses—a quarter to a third of their total number—and were only able to retreat back to Menzoberranzan when a small contingent of House Baenre was sent to cover their backs. The duergar and tanarukk armies continued on to besiege Menzoberranzan.</p>
