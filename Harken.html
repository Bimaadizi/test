<p>Harken was a priest of Ilmater in the late-13 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to 1281 DR , Harken lived in an Ilmatari monastery that was located just outside of Illefarn . On that year Harken and the rest of his fellow clergymen had their minds dominated by an Ilmtari priest named Poquelin, who in reality was the devil Belhifet in disguise.</p>
<p>Mesmerized by Poquelin, Harken and the other Ilmatari followed him north into the region of Icewind Dale . They then traveled through the Kuldahar Pass , losing many of their fellow clergymen along the way, and down into the ruins of the dwarven fortress Dorn's Deep .</p>
<p>In the Lower Depths of these ruins he and four others instructed to guard the magical idol inside what had once been a temple to the dwarven god Berronar Truesilver , with Sister Incylia stationed next to him. While guarding the idol they and the other Ilmatari were individually surrounded by a magical barrier. Overtime they watched as Poquelin became more militant and fascist, but the magic of the idol had them too enthralled to resist and made them believe his words superseded the gospel of Ilmatar. Those outside the idol's range tried to resist him and for their efforts were transformed into undead guardians for the idol, such as boneguards , mummies , and zombies .</p>
<p>Eventually, a group of adventurers arrived that year and destroyed the idol, thus freeing Harken and the rest of his fellow Ilmatari from its dominating effect. Once freed Harken was in shock and repeatedly stuttered something about plate armor .</p>
