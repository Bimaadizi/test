<p>The Chalice of Amaunator was a powerful and ancient Amaunatori artifact . It was considered a powerful weapon against the forces of darkness and the antithesis of anything related to the Shadow Weave .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The chalice was made from alabaster , wrapped with bands of gold and inlayed with fire opals , jacinths , and topazes . The sides of its bowl featured two removable seals, about the size of a gold coin , each inscribed with a sunburst that resembled Amaunator 's holy symbol . The chalice itself stood about two hand-widths tall.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Chalice of Amaunator possessed several magical powers that could be evoked by anyone that held it.

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Chalice of Amaunator was created some time during the time of ancient Netheril , an empire that collapsed over three centuries before Dale Reckoning .</p>
<p>At some point, one of the chalice's seals was separated from the rest of the artifact. It somehow wound up within the Crypt of Augathra the Mad .</p>
<p>During or after the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR , a group of adventurers recovered the Chalice of Amaunator from Askilion's Tower , in order to prevent Shadovar followers of Shar from uncovering until magical secrets.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>It was said that the liquid sun produced by the Chalice of Amaunator could potentially melt down the Quess'Ar'Teranthvar , the golden tree that comprised one of the two sets of Nether Scrolls . This could only be accomplished however, if the Quess'Ar'Teranthvar's creator, Tyvollus Aluviirsan , released it from his protection.</p>
