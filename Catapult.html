<p>A catapult was a large ranged weapon typically used to lay siege to a fortified structure. They were also mounted on ships for naval combat as well as on spelljammers for battles in space.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Catapults were siege engines capable of launching heavy missiles at a target. Most converted tension or torsion energy that was slowly and manually built up within the device before release, via springs, bows, twisted rope, elastic, or any of numerous other materials and mechanisms.</p>
<p>It was capable of launching a number of different missiles, from large stones to flaming ammunition. Biological payloads such as dead animals or containers of raw sewage have also been used.</p>
<p>Due to their size, catapults required a dedicated and trained crew to operate. Large, heavy catapults required a crew of up to ten individuals, while smaller lighter ones only up to six individuals.</p>
<p>Catapults found on marine vessels were usually aimed and shot in only one direction. Catapults used during sieges were mobile but once positioned had limited angles of fire.</p>
