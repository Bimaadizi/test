<p>Zaravron Rarthree was the leader and major stakeholder of the Shield Trading Company , headquartered in Voonlar , some years before the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , through at least the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Zaravron was originally a trader in textiles but he greatly expanded the business into a large merchant house that had caravan routes throughout the Dalelands and the Moonsea region in north Faer√ªn . Despite the great influence of the Zhentarim in the same geographical and economic regions, Zaravron managed to keep the Shield Trading Company independent and unaffiliated with that organization.</p>
<p>In his later years, Zaravron became somewhat of a recluse and was seldom seen in public.</p>
