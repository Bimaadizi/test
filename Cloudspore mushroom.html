<p>Cloudspore mushrooms were a peculiar species of fungus that typically grew in the Underdark .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This species of mushroom grew in patches and was so named for its propensity to unleash thick clouds of spores when disturbed. Once a cloud was discharged, a patch of cloudspores would not unleash another for 24 hours.</p>
<h2>Habitats</h2>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point long before the 15 th century DR , a Silvanus worshiping druid took up residence within a barrow in southern Unther and therein cultivated cloudspore mushrooms. Centuries later, when a young blue dragon took up residence in the abandoned barrow in 1479 DR , a few of the druid's specimens still remained.</p>
