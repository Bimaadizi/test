<p>In the late Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Mirt guided Delg , Shandril Shessair and Narm Tamaraith to Tethgard as a safety measure, as they were pursued by Zhentilar . While there, Mirt was forced to call out to Duskreene to get her aid in destroying the Zhentilar. She later made an acquaintance of his guests.</p>
