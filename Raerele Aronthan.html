<p>Raerele Aronthan , also known as Redtresses , was a priestess of Auril in the mid–14 th century DR who proclaimed herself "High Icemaiden" of the church of Auril .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the first-half of 14 th century DR, Raerele Aronthan ascended to a senior role in the church of Auril, and strove to impose hierarchy and order over the generally disorganized and independent followers of her goddess. She soon held sway over about forty clerics , and declared herself "High Icemaiden" as she sought to bring the entire church under her control. In the 1340s DR, her followers erected the fortress of Frostspire out of glacial ice northeast of Citadel Adbar , and once it was completed, the High Icemaiden demanded that all of Auril's clergy make a pilgrimage to Frostspire to swear fealty to her.</p>
<p>Over the next decade, it became her goal to put all of Auril's followers "in their places" within her church hierarchy. Unsurprisingly, this made her many enemies among her fellow Aurilians, and one of whom successfully killed her in the Year of the Dragon, 1352 DR . Tellingly, the assassin received no rebuke from Auril, and Aronthan's undead spirit remained trapped and tormented in Frostspire by the goddess herself.</p>
<h3>Legacy</h3>
<p>While the Aurilians were not sad to see Aronthan dead, they remained enamored with the power she had acquired. Even over a century later, powerful members of the clergy like Faerovel Hawntar and Amgrel Vlorund were still trying to emulate her. Meanwhile, her fortress of Frostspire continued to play an important role for the church, serving as a secret headquarters and a place of judgment where wayward clerics were brought for trial and punishment.</p>
