<p>The Great Rift was the traditional home of Faerûn's gold dwarves , though there was also a human city nearby, called Khôltar , until the Spellplague of 1385 DR . The country of 1,300,000 dwarves, gnomes , halflings , and humans was nominally ruled by a monarchy, but actually by a council of clan elders named the Deep Lords, from the capital of Underhome .</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>"There is a difference between a Dwarf and a pick-axe" was a saying in the Great Rift. It meant that a good king didn't use his people like tools.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the Spellplague hit in 1385 DR , the western half of the Great Rift collapsed into the Underdark, forming an enormous canyon called the Underchasm . What remained of the Great Rift became known as East Rift . Underhome was destroyed in the cataclysm and the capital was moved to Eartheart.</p>
<p>During the Second Sundering in 1486 DR . the quest of the four chosen ( Kleef Kenric , Malik el Sami , Joelle Emmeline and Arietta Seasilver ) to deliver the Eye of Gruumsh to Grumbar for Luthic and to stop Shar restored the canyon to its former earthly land before the Spellplague.</p>
