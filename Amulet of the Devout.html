<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before the late 15 th century DR , the Amulet of the Devout belonged to the mage Otto from Oerth who had a certain fondness for magical jewelry. By some means, possibly left as an offering, the Amulet of the Devout ended up stored in the trapped and secured vault underneath the Stormshore Tabernacle , a non-denominational shrine in Baldur's Gate in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . If anyone was daring or foolish enough to rob the temple and steal Otto's amulet, they were castigated by the divinities of the Realms , sending devas and cambions to end their lives.</p>
