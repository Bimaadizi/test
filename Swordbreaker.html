<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Swordbreakers' many shapes could also have several types of serrations on on side of the blades. Greatsword swordbreakers possessed serrated edges that resembled a saw, ripping and sawing through wood and leather with effortless savagery.</p>
<p>Longsword swordbreakers were medium-sized weapons with thicker and deeper metal teeth on one side of the blade. They were usually forged out of tempered steel and were used in dueling and gladiatorial battles.</p>
<p>Knife, or dagger swordbreakers were short, wide, and heavy noted blades, sometimes dual-wielded. Same could be said about short sword swordbreakers. They were wielded in off-hand and used to patty and trap opponents' blades in between the tines.</p>
