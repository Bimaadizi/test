<p>The Galena Mountains , or simply the Galenas , were a massive and forbidding mountain range that formed a natural border around Vaasa in Northeast Faerûn . Some scholars referred to the western arc of the range as an extension of the Earthspurs during the mid-14 th century DR and later as the West Galena Mountains , with this second name becoming more common during the 15 th century DR.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The range was about 250 mi (400 km) long, not more than about 25 mi (40 km) wide, and 15,000 ft (4,600 m) tall. It formed a ring around Vaasa from the west to the east in a counterclockwise direction. The range was extremely jagged and permanently topped with ice and snow.</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>The mountains were rich in valuable minerals, and mining operations were among the most productive on Toril . The Galenas were best known for bloodstone , iron and silver . Despite the danger from hostile inhabitants, people came to the mountains in the hope of mining their way to riches, especially the dwarves , who had set up the Bloodstone mines , Hillsafar Hall and Ironspur in the area in order to cultivate the ores. There was an ever-present danger of tunneling into the Underdark beneath the mountains and unleashing the evil creatures within.</p>
<p>While the western Galenas were just as rich as the rest of the mountains to the east, they were largely ignored by outsiders for quite some time. Only local miners and the native dwarves of the region knew of these additional sources of wealth.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Galenas created the border that formed a natural border around the lands of Vaasa , separating it from Damara to the east, Thar and the Moonsea lake to the south, and the Ride and the rest of the Moonsea North to the west. An arm of the Galenas' southeastern peaks were bordered by the White River , dividing them from the Earthspur Mountains to the south.</p>
<h3>Geographic Features</h3>
<p>Due to the extremely impassable terrain that constituted the majority of the mountain range, the Bloodstone Pass was the only realistic crossing point for humanoids across the eastern arm for quite some time, though the High Walk to the north was also an option. The main pass to the east was Garumn's Climb , and a lesser known route called Gramble's Climb crossed through to the south to Thar on the shores of the Moonsea.</p>
<p>Notable peaks of the Galena Mountains included Suncatcher Mountain , that marked the point where the range met the Earthspurs , Mount Throndor , long-associated with the doomed King Dauringogh , and Mount Blaarrbi , a peak that featured a mystic maelstrom in a most unusual location.</p>
<p>The Galena Snake was a winding river that flowed south from the northeastern edge of the range, before turning southeast and joining the Icelace River . There was a meltwater surge every spring but it was otherwise unnavigable. The Goliad River was located just a ways south, situated near the High Walk path along the eastern slops bordering Damara, and the Beaumaris River was south of that, flowing down either franks of the peaks into both its neighboring realms.</p>
<p>Nestled in the southern arm of the Galenas was the Winterspear River , that wound through the foothills north of Thar before emptying into the Moonsea lake, and the Telstang Brook and Naed Creek , a pair of streams that snaked through the Ride to form Lake Longreach .</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>Worgs were known to make their lairs throughout some locations in the Galenas, and perytons lived atop its western peaks.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>As the Galena Mountains were a source of natural wealth that could bring great riches to people, many people ventured into its mines every year. It was said that successful miners could mine out millions of gold pieces worth of valuable minerals.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the War of Vaasa broke out in the Cold Lands during the mid–14 th century DR , absolutely chaos erupted throughout some areas of the Galena Mountains. During the conflict, the Grandfather of Assassins began for him his army of bandits and instill fear in the people living in the lands to the east.</p>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , the mountains played host to a council of metallic dragons , called forth by Lareth , Sovereign of the gold dragons . Lareth proposed that they collectively begin to enter slumber, in order to avoid the effects of the Rage of Dragons that was driving their kind to acts of great destruction.</p>
<p>During the late 15 th century, the eastern Galenas became a place of conflict once again. The Warlock Knights of Vaasa razed Bloodstone Pass in 1469 DR , which then became the site of a decades-long standoff between the Knights and Damara under King Yarin Frostmantle .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
