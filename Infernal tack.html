<p>Infernal tack was a set of magical equipment used exclusively by narzugon .</p>
<h2>Desciption</h2>
<p>Infernal tack was a set of special horse tack. It included a bit , bridle , reins , saddle , spurs , and stirrups .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Narzugon used infernal tack on their nightmare steeds. Once equipped, the nightmare dutifully served their narzugon. This bond was forced on a nightmare, as they despised forced servitude. However, some nightmares were known to form a strong bond with their narzugon master. A narzugon summoned their mount by tapping the spurs together or passing them though blood. Infernal tack only summoned a nightmare who was already in service of the narzugon.</p>
