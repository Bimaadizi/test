<p>Dravidge was a clerk who worked at Candulhallow's Funeral Arrangements in the Heapside district of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Candulhallow's Funeral Arrangements was run by a secret Bhaalist cabal â€“ the Murder Tribunal . Clerk Dravidge was instructed to crank up the prices so high that very little stock was ever sold by "the Management." Dravidge was to do the bare minimum to make the shop appear legitimate. As per an instructional memo from "the Management," the shop was more of a stage than an actual business.</p>
