<p>Dornavver was a master sword-smith of the 3rd century DR , who forged the legendary sword Dornavver , the "Demonbane".</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>To counter the growing spread of evil under the Shoon Imperium and a plethora of evil artifacts fashioned at the time, the Church of Ilmater sought a weapon to combat such evil. To this end, Dornavver forged for them a bastard sword , with a multicolored blade of an unknown alloy and a silver-plated crosspiece. The symbol of Ilmater was etched into the pommel. This sword was completed in the Year of the Wrath Sword, 275 DR . It was named Dornavver after the smith.</p>
<p>On the night of the Feast of the Moon that same year, senior clergy of Ilmater took the sword to Allyn's Anvil in the Alimir Mountains east of Calimshan , where they enchanted it in an impassioned ritual. These events were documented in the tome Relics of the Righteous .</p>
