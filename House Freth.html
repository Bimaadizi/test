<p>House Freth was a drow house of Menzoberranzan . The house insignia was often proudly displayed on their warrior's chests and bracers and was an image of a phoenix , rising from the ashes towards a dark-green moon.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Before their destruction they started to breed venom oozes . The oozes were made through experiments, even though the house is destroyed the venom oozes survived and started to multiply through the Underdark .</p>
<p>After being reestablished sometime before 1369 DR, the drow of House Freth learned to tame horrifying arraccats found in the dungeons of Myth Drannor. Whether taming done via animal handling or magical means was unclear.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The house was one of the lower houses of Menzoberranzan. In 1319 DR , it was attacked and was nearly destroyed by House Teken'duis . However, some nobles survived the attack. Thus, there were witnesses to this act and the attack was a failure. The Ruling Council of Menzoberranzan decided to destroy House Teken'duis. The three surviving nobles of House Freth (two females, the oldest of which had just finished training at Arach-Tinilith , and one male) were taken to be combined into the house of Yvonnel Baenre .</p>
<p>Apparently reestablished by 1369 DR , scouts of House Freth found a way into the deepest levels of the Elven Catacombs under Castle Cormanthor . Allied with House Kilsek , Dreydre Freth and Greyanna Freth led the drow excavation and recovery of the ancient elven magic from the ruins, smuggling it back to the Undermountain. At some point after the operation's start, the daughters of the House Freth encountered the forces of the Cult of the Dragon that was operating in Myth Drannor at the time. House Freth stroke a deal with the Cult that allowed their operations continue uninterrupted in exchange for betraying the House Kilsek. The Kilsek drow were killed and enthralled into service as the leader of the betrayed house's operations, Nathlilik Kilsek was thrown into the Cult's prison. That alliance did not last, as the group of heroes assembled by Elminster Aumar , the Veiled Ones , made their way into the drow territory, slaying Dreydre and Greyanna.</p>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , House Freth was the Nineteenth House of Menzoberranzan, following the destruction of House Fathomlin that year.</p>
<p>Around 1492 DR , a Freth contingent led by Erelal Freth was trying to conquer Undermountain from the Maze Level facing the opposition of a House Auvryndar contingent.</p>
