<p>Elah'zad , meaning House of the Moon in Midani , was an isolated oasis located in the Sword region of Anauroch . It was considered a sacred place of great power by the nomadic Bedine people that called the desert their home.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Elah'zad was nestled within a valley surrounded by 1,000‑foot-tall (300‑meter) mounds of earth that were dotted with scores of small water springs. Water flowed down into a vividly blue lake, 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) in width, that gave life to striking and beautiful plant life. Because the lake of Elah'zad was considered sacred by the Bedine people, their camels were forbidden from drinking from its waters.</p>
<p>Within the center of the beauteous lake was a small, grass-covered isle set in the shape of a half moon. It covered approximately 100 yards (91 meters) of the lake's surface.</p>
<p>A two-way portal linked Elah'zad with the Ring of Wyvernstones in the Hullack Forest .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It was an isolated settlement that was hidden within the difficult-to-traverse Hills of Scent , just north of the Wall of Fallen Djinn mountain range.</p>
<p>The Well of the Cloven Rock oasis was located about 60 miles (97 kilometers) east from Elah'zad.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>The shrubbery found in Elah'zad had distinct red-colored leaves with starkly contrasting blue stems. The trees shared the colors of several metals, including copper and silver .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , Elah'zad was the meeting place of fifteen sheikhs of the sixteen surviving tribes of the Bedine, including the two leaders that had arranged their assembly, Sa'ar of the Bait Mahwa and Utaiba of the Raz'hadi . All the Bedine came together to decide what must be done to deal with the emerging threat posed by the Zhentarim .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>According to Bedine legend, the valley was once home to the moon goddess Elah , before she was driven away by the goddess of the sun, At'ar the Merciless . At'ar then transformed Elah'zad into a prison for Eldath , the Mother of Waters, as she was jealous of the beauty Eldath possessed.</p>
<p>It was one of the known locations where the Ritual of the Waxing could be performed using the Eye of Selûne .</p>
