<p>Kostchtchie's Maw , was a massive prison and water-filled chasm found on Avernus , the topmost layer of the Nine Hells . The prison's name derived from the fact it was the one-time prison of Kostchtchie , the demon lord who had been stripped of his favored weapon and shackled within by Zariel .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The infernal prison comprised a 1,000‑foot-long (300‑meter) chasm, some 200 feet (61 meters) wide and 500 feet (150 meters) deep, filled with the murky, mind-altering waters of the River Styx . Only a portion of the waters' depth within was visible, however, as what lay beneath was unperceivable from the battleground of Avernus.</p>
<p>Before it became flooded, Kostchtchie's Maw was an enormous pit set within steep cliff walls. While these cliffsides were traversable with some effort, the journey was precarious and fraught with peril. Within its depths was an enormous tar pit , some 80 feet (24 meters) wide and 10 feet (3 meters) deep.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time during the late 15 th century DR , Kostchtchie was freed from imprisonment within the maw that bore his name. The chasm was then repurposed as a prison for the soul of the Storm King Hekaton , who was bound to Toril as an undead servant of Szass Tam .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>Within the bottom of Kostchtchie's Maw was Mirror Maelstrom , a stronghold of black iron that resembled a twisted facsimile of the storm giant fortress of Maelstrom on Toril . Its surface was crusted over with barnacles composed of hardened magma and warded to protect it from divination and teleportation magic.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>When it remained empty, Kostchtchie's Maw held only the demon lord himself, restrained by magical chains that continuously tightened over the demon lord's form. He was guarded by his infernal jailor, the kyton Mazer and his four hell hound minions.</p>
<p>Later on, Mirror Maelstrom housed a myriad of devils that watched over its prisoner, including yugoloths and mortal Red Wizards from the Faerûnian realm of Thay .</p>
