<p>Lhabbartan was a mage at some point before the 8 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Laughter, 761 DR , the sage Beldrune , working at the Moonshorn Tower , opined about a certain Olbert 's triple-delayed blast fireball spell. Beldrune noted that Olbert had created that spell by combining the work of Iliymbrim Sharnult , Lhabbartan, and a third person whose name he could not recall at the moment. This strongly implied that Lhabbartan's work predated Olbert's.</p>
