<p>Wraithworms were a magical , planar species of snake with an unexplained connection to the undead .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These serpents had large, powerful bodies measuring 10 feet (3 meters) in length, but were rather slow and lethargic. Their heads were nearly human in size, with fangs measuring 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in length, and they had glowing eyes. Their scales had a coal-black and bright green coloration, as well as dark purple bands that ran down the center of their back in a diamond pattern.</p>
<p>The spine of a wraithworm featured sharp, bony spikes that jutted through the scales of its back. However, these were simply a deterrent and were not utilized offensively by wraithworms.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Wraithworms possessed a level of intellect comparable to most animals. They were quite territorial and wouldn't tolerate the presence of other predators in their hunting grounds.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>These creatures possessed a number of innate abilities that mimicked powers commonly found in undead creatures. These included their ability to assume a wraithform only harmable by +1 or better weapons, their partial immunity to harm from cold and negative energy , and their bite drained living creatures of their life force. The intense, bitter cold feeling imparted by their powerful, slow-working venom was also suggestive of this. In addition, if a priest were to cast turn undead , it would render a wraithworm motionless for one to three minutes.</p>
<p>Beyond those undead-like traits, while tangible a wraithworm could paralyze weak creatures within 15 feet (4.6 meters) of them with their gaze. However, wraithworms had to focus their attention while doing so.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Due to their slow movements, wraithworms relied upon stealth while hunting. They often utilized their wraithform to sneak upon on prey or make an escape. Whenever they got within striking range of a creature, wraithworms briefly moved with a blinding speed.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Wraithworms lived solitary and nomadic lives, roving their territory instead of having a set burrow or lair. They were active during daylight hours. And they could be introduced to most ecosystems without having a harmful impact.</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Wraithworms were a carnivorous species, commonly preying upon birds and other small animals. It was fairly rare for them to ever attack humans out of hunger.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>The preferred habitats of wraithworms were deserts, rocky wastes, and barren badlands. They were commonly found in the plane of Carceri on the layer of Minethys and the plane of Arborea on its desert layer Pelion . They could also be found in parts of Baator and the Gray Waste .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Wraithworms typically avoided humans. On ocassions when they did strike at them, it was due to the human having gotten too close for the serpent's comfort.</p>
<p>In terms of the deities worshiped on Toril , wraithworms were known to act as servants of Sseth and the Mulhorandi deity Thoth .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>How the wraithworms came to possess their undead-like characteristics was a matter of debate among planar sages. One of the two most widely accepted theories, one was that long-term exposure to the strange energies and magics of the Outer Planes had caused some mundane serpents to develop into them. The other most widely accepted theory was that some greater fiend or an evil deity had created them to be so for either their own purposes or their amusement.</p>
