<p>A turnip was a common root vegetable found around Faerûn , and eaten both on the surface of Toril , and underneath in the Underdark .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<h3>Properties</h3>
<p>Turnips were rounded white-pink vegetables that had creamy white flesh and edible leaves. A type of turnip known around the Sea of Fallen Stars was called a roouddan , the red turnip of Proskur . Turnips grew best in sunny areas, as even partial shade would stunt their growth.</p>
<p>Jan Jansen claimed that southern turnips were red and gold in color, and that those further south were blue.</p>
<h3>Availability</h3>
<p>The hamlet of Battlerise was home to several hardy farmers who grew turnips, as was the village of Maskyr's Eye , and turnips and other root vegetables grew well in the vale. The settlement of Nightstone had a medium-sized turnip garden to the east known as Hulvaarn Farm —the house patriarch tripped on a garden rock during a cloud giant raid, and quickly died. The Damaran family continued to grow turnips after the death of the house patriarch. Terraced farms in the High Dale grew turnips, as well as raising livestock, and both were an important part of trade in Highcastle . Inns and taverns located in Hardbuckler sold a variety of mushrooms , lichens , stews , and turnips.</p>
<p>Turnips were also grown in Cormyr , on the farmlands around Ghars .</p>
<p>Turnips were also known to be eaten in Kara-Tur .</p>
<p>Cloud giants were keen gardeners, and were able to produce turnips that were as large as pumpkins , which they grew in devoted spaces.</p>
<p>Beyond the Prime Material plane , turnips were cultivated by farmers in Barovia .</p>
<h3>Culinary</h3>
<p>Many races were known to eat turnips, such as humans , gnomes , and halflings . Not only civilized beings delighted in eating turnips, but so did several animals, such as sea gulls .</p>
<p>These versatile vegetables had several uses in the culinary arts. Turnips were known to have been served after being pan -fried, such as in the Hungry Man Inn, in Arabel .</p>
<p>Ration packs often contained turnips, and lasted at least two weeks. A week's worth of such rations cost 10 gp from Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue 's Wilderness Gear section.</p>
<p>The Sly Fox inn, located in Zelbross of the Savage Frontier , served hot turnip pies. Hearty meals of rothé meat, fungi , bread , and turnips from the surface were made available at Findlewulf's Galley in Skullport , the Underdark . The Bargewright Inn sold pork and beef roasts paired with turnips, potatoes , and radishes . Residents of the keep in Grimmantle were often served turnips, dried herbs , and rabbit . Some varieties of wine were soured by being treated with turnips. Turnips were sometimes paired with kale in stews, or with lamb , eel , and peppers .</p>
<h3>Other Uses</h3>
<p>Turnips were not just grown to be eaten, but had various other uses throughout the Realms . They could also be used to make ink to pen magical scrolls , such as for the message spell . The turnips had to be diced and added to a boiling mixture as the penultimate ingredient, followed by a non- human ear. The mixture then had to be stirred well with a vundwood rod after each new ingredient was added, and boiled gently. The turnip-infused residue had to be scraped out of the cauldron and stirred into a sepia. After an hour of frequent mixing, the ink had to settle for a single day.</p>
<p>A textile trader, Wulve Raikyn , planned to use a wagon full of turnips to disguise stolen goods from Waterdeep .</p>
<p>Scarecrow constructs were often made from wooden bodies and had a turnip for a head.</p>
<p>According to the eccentric gnome inventor, Jan Jansen, turnips had even further uses. Jan claimed that turnips could be used for beer (apparently for its medicinal qualities, as well as its great taste), lotions , salves , cakes , muffins , as a meal served with fried imps and garlic , stew , salad , and tea . He also claimed that a wizard he knew believed that a turnip would make a fine component for a lich spell .</p>
<p>Turnips even had uses when they were no longer fresh. When thoroughly rotten, turnips were sometimes saved and thrown at criminals or heretics in public due to their rank smell and slimy texture. This was especially the case in Zhentil Keep when " Cyric lovers" were outlawed.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Ancient History</h3>
<p>Turnips were known to be grown even in the times of Netheril . In these ancient times, peasants would till turnips in areas close to the Nauseef Flow .</p>
<p>In The Illustrated Adventures of Balduran , Balduran was once confronted by a devil . The devil attempted to lure him into a deal for his soul, and Balduran accepted, but only for a turnip in return. Prior to the conclusion of the story, the devil is on her knees, defeated. She swore that she would come to Balduran's call if he needed it. In conclusion, Balduran boasted to the bound devil that it was all due to the powers of turnips, and that she should never play down what may seem like a mere vegetable.</p>
<h3>14 th century DR</h3>
<p>In 1328 DR , the bard Velorna Jalaneth wrote the ballad, Friends I Weep For You . The theme of the ballad included standing together with friends until the end. A memorable part of the ballad spoke of farmers reaping turnips as a comparison to kingdoms being roused.</p>
<p>As reported by Jan Jansen, Sune developed a particular liking for turnips around a decade prior to 1369 DR . Although this sounded absurd and another of his seemingly made-up stories, others (some of which would become deities) were also noted to enjoy turnips around the same time, some in no small proportions. In 1358 DR , Midnight , Kelemvor , and their allies visited the Lonesome Tankard tavern in Eveningstar . The maid served a variety of food and drink, including wine , ale , meat, and vegetables. Out of the selection, Midnight immediately helped herself to "generous portions" of sliced turnips, whilst only having a single slice of pork.</p>
<p>On Eleint 18 , 1367 DR , Bryn Goldtooth of Ghars, Cormyr, received 0.5 bushels (18 liters) of turnips in a trade. He offered these to Jasper in a good deal, but he declined, professing not to be a turnip-eating man. In Uktar , 1367 DR, the turnip harvest in Chessenta was so high that such root vegetables were sold as low as about 1 cp for a basket, or even less. The farmers of the region were warned of the market crash, and they struggled to sell to anywhere easily reached by wagons or ships .</p>
<p>In 1369 DR , Jansen claimed that the Cormyrians once caused a boom in the turnip market when a great onion famine spread through Faerûn.</p>
<p>In 1374 DR , the conflict between Sembia and Thultanthar caused the price of turnips to rise dramatically in the city of Selgaunt . The cost for a sack of turnips rose from one or two cp for a sack to as much as a silver fivestar . It was feared that dramatic change of events would lead to riots in the streets.</p>
<p>In 1396 DR , Raidon Kane was mysteriously found injured in a bed or turnips; the farmers nursed him back to health for a tenday.</p>
<h3>15 th century DR</h3>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , the Cult of the Dragon overtook Xonthal's Tower . Within its lounge, the cultists used turnips and other ingredients to make simple dishes. Mabannok Kovri , a gnome druid , spent much of his free time acquiring dwarven poetry and recipes that honored the "noble turnip."</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Turnips were known for their curative powers, and were often used as medicine. These root vegetables could be used as a cure for mouth disease and a treatment for sore throats.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Despite their many uses, turnips had a possibly unwarranted association with foolishness. Bryn Goldtooth said of Elizabeth Clawthorn that "she's got a turnip in her head instead of a brain" and Jasper wrote "And take me for a turnip if I didn't agree to do it" after realizing his unwise acceptance of a dare.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>According to halfling superstition, when planting rows of turnips, a well-rounded stone needed to be placed near the top of the patch. If this was done, they believed that Yondalla would bring them large vegetables upon harvest.</p>
