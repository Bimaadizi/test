<p>Anlaervrith Mrantarr was a drow infiltrator in Scornubel during the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was a drow .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Qilué Veladorn had gotten the impression while mind-touching her that Anlaervrith was lazy and indulgent, caring for very little other than wine, gems, sweet things to eat, servants to whip, and sometimes, humans to lay with.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>She had been an initiate to the worship of Lolth .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR , she was impersonating Namra Dunseltree .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>While in her impersonation, she was under the direct command of Daerdatha , another drow sorceress, who controlled her by direct mental commands on occassion. She worked together with a fellow impersonator who played the part of Inder Dunseltree , though he did not give his name.</p>
<p>Unknown to her, more than one person could affect her mind through the spells of Daerdatha, including the warrior Quztyr , whom she was acquainted with.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Anlaervrith Mrantarr had been an initiate of Lolth in an undisclosed subterranean city until she was contacted by the sorceress Daerdratha, who recruited her for an infiltration. In the infilrtation, she was required to take the shape of Namra Dunseltree, the wife of a merchant from Scornubel ; she played her part to the best of her ability, taking the opportunity to indulge her appetites, both for food, and for cruelty. She received many commands directly in her mind.</p>
<p>At some point, Anlaervrith whipped one of her servants, a young woman by the name of Isryl , to near death; finding her walking again not a day later, Anlaervrith attacked her, still in the guise of Namra. Unknown to her, that was actually Qilué Veladorn , who responded by mind-touching her, stealing a handful of memories, knocking her out, disabling her transformation, and then whisking her away to the vicinity of the Ladystone in Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Aftermath</h2>
<p>Qilué took her shape and infiltrated her next mission, not being discovered until later.</p>
