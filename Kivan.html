<p>Kivan was an elven ranger from the Shilmista forest in the Lands of Intrigue . During the midâ€“14 th century DR he set out on a mission of revenge against the individual that ruined his life.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Kivan was a stoic man of few words. He was rather undiplomatic, cold in nature and extremely gruff with others. As such he did not readily become friendly with others.</p>
<p>He did not like being in cities or traveling underground like the " dwarven folk." As to be expected Kivan was not fond of drow or those that followed Lolth .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Despite his solitary nature Kivan was wholeheartedly in love with his wife Deheriana .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A few years before the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Kivan and Deheriana took a romantic vacation away from their daily lives. The couple were waylaid and captured by a group of bandits led by the half-ogre Tazok . The bandit leader tortured both of them for his own enjoyment. While Kivan was able to escape with his life, Deheriana was not so fortunate.</p>
<p>Kivan set out on mission of vengeance. In the months prior to the iron crisis , Kivan began hunting bandits as a means to get closer to Tazok and the Blacktalons .</p>
<p>Some time that year or next, he Kivan began working with several other adventurers tasked with escorting a future bride to the home of her groom in Amn . Among the others involved were the noble paladin Ajantis , the warrior Shar-Teel Dosan , the Cyricist priest Tiax , and Eldoth Kron . Unfortunately the group was almost immediately assaulted by a band of hobgoblins . Kivan's fate after the battle was unknown.</p>
