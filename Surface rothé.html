<p>Surface rothé , also known as high rothé or brown rothé , were a variety of rothé that lived in surface lands.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Surface rothé had shaggy brown fur, cloven hooves, and two curving horns. Their fur was longer and shaggier and their legs were longer compared to their subterranean relatives.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Surface rothé could fight with both their teeth and horns. They were skittish and prone to stampeding, which could be quite dangerous for anyone in their path.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Rothé were considered an essential animal in the North due to the meat, hides, and versatile milk they provided. Their dung was often used as a fuel source. They were also known to be frequently herded by rashemi .</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Rothé dwelt on the surface, in both cold and warm climates. They were commonly found in the mountains and glaciers of northwest Faerûn in the Moonsea . They occasionally wandered over onto the icy dunes of the Anauroch .</p>
<p>The further south the rothé dwelt, the lighter the color and density of their fur. They were found throughout the Western Heartlands and south Faerûn . They could also be found in the Stonelands and were herded in the Shaar and Rashemen .</p>
