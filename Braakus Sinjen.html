<p>Braakus Sinjen was the apprentice and the right hand to the Guild Master Georges of the Shadow Thieves ' guild branch in Undermountain in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Braakus Sinjen was a devote Mask worshiper and a talented thief. He often utilized his charisma to distract and disarm his victims, allowing the reinforcements to ambush the unwitting targets.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1370 DR , the Shadow Thieves guild under the leadership of Guild Master Georges returned to Waterdeep . To maintain secrecy, they created a hideout and a stronghold beep in the mega-dungeon under the City of Splendors, Undermountain. There the guild grew and increased its numbers. Braakus Sinjen was the Guild Master's favorite pupil and was leading the guild's day-to-day activities, such as recruitment, morale, and fending off the goblin raids from the nearby tribe. Braakus conducted his duties from a hidden shrine of Mask, protected by an illusory wall at the heart of the stronghold. That shrine was used for joining ceremonies of the new recruits as they took the oaths and committed to the Mask's dogma.</p>
<p>Eventually, the guild's activities were discovered by the Lords of Waterdeep , and a lone hero was sent to investigate and dismantle the thieves' operations. When confronted with the adventurer, Braakus Sinjen attempted to distract the hero with his honeyed words, friendliness, and offer of joining, only to let his fellow Shadows spring a trap.</p>
