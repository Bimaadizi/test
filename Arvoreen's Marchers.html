<p>Arvoreen's Marchers was a knightly order of Arvoreen dedicated to the protection of Tethyr and the elimination of the lands' monsters. They were highly respected amongst both the Hin and Tethyrians alike.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Marchers consisted of primarily halfling paladins , though there were some gnomes within their ranks. Many of the paladins of this order also doubled as priests of Arvoreen, fighters , and even rogues . Those of the roguish persuasion typically served the order under the capacity of couriers and spies. Their numbers also notably included some Arvoreen's Keepers , special warriors-priests within the Arvoreenan faith.</p>
<p>They regularly patrolled the duchy of Purple Marches , primarily through County Vintor . Through their efforts a great deal of monsters were ousted from the duchy.</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>The paladins of the order, referred to as Wary Swordknights, were known for their martial prowess and being quite vigilant. They could dodge as well as any barbarian , trip and grapple with foes twice their size, and could cast haste on themselves once per day.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>Keeperstone was the chapterhouse of the Marchers, a forsaken manor 1​ to ​2 miles (1,600​ to ​3,200 meters) north of the halfling community of Barrowsmom that they had rebuilt after its destruction during the Ten Black Days of Eleint .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The order was formed in 1358 DR , and they gained great renown for their efforts during the Tethyrian Interregnum . While they protected the Purple Hills , Arvoreen's Marchers kept full-blown anarchy from spreading over their realm as it had been the rest of the country. They also ensured that halfling communities remained safe during the Interregnum.</p>
