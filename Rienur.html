<p>Rienur was a sailor aboard the Vigilant circa 1374 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Rienur was a notoriously cantankerous, especially for a halfling . His attitude could put a mad half-orc to shame.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Rienur was part of the Vigilant's crew in the 1374 DR when Captain Lastri Kassireh 's ship sailed from the Sword Coast to the nation of Samarach on the Chultan Peninsula . Onboard the ship were several passengers, including Volothamp Geddarm who traveled to meet with a wealthy yuan-ti merchant, Sa'Sani . The voyage was cursed with bad luck and numerous strange occurrences. Food supplies were mysteriously spoiled; freshwater barrels ruptured; one of the crew, a sailor got drunk and drowned; Volo almost got poisoned as his poison soup took the life of Joquin ; and Rienur noticed new ropes becaming strangely frayed.</p>
<p>The halfling's life ended when the string of occurrences culminated in a deadly storm. The Vigilant's shipwreck was washed ashore not far from the city of Samargol . Most sailors perished in the storm, while others were captured to be devoured by the local cannibalistic Batiri goblins .</p>
