<p>Wardragons were a class of four massive magical warships that served as the flagships of the Evermeet navy.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These enormous vessels were 600 feet (180 meters) long and 100 feet (30 meters) wide, larger than even the giant -crewed Krigvind and Hvalspyd longships . They had polished white hulls and large, ornate dragon -shaped bowsprits.</p>
<p>They were heavily armored and armed, and used innate magical propulsion rather than oars or sails. Though relatively clumsy compared to other ships, no human watercraft on the Trackless Sea could challenge a wardragon in battle. In addition to the regular crew of 200 elves , the wardragons could also carry 800 more marines, a complement of flying creatures such as pegasi and giant eagles , and many tons of supplies. They also usually carried up to three catamaran fast attack boats.</p>
