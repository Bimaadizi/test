<p>Garius was a rogue active in the Moonshae Isles during the late 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>As a thief, Garius had no issue with harming others for the sake of profit, but he despised those who acted for the sake of wanton cruelty.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Garius traveled the world before joining the Doomed Legion to serve Prince Ketheryll at the Castle of Skulls . Although bound to serve and protect the Prince, Garius instead came to despise his evil master.</p>
<p>According to local legends on Gwynneth , Garius managed to flee the Castle of Skulls on the night that it became cursed —the Summer Solstice in the Year of the Vaasan Knot, 299 DR . However, the truth was that he was caught by Ketheryll, who used his magic to transform the rogue into a cheap tin knife .</p>
<p>In the following centuries, the Castle would become a haunted place in which an undead Ketheryll dwelt. To lure victims to his lair, Ketheryll used his magic to cast illusions over Garius to make the cheap knife appear to be made of platinum and gems and then planted him in the nearby forest to attract treasure-hunters. Garius also gained the ability to point in the direction of Ketheryll and the Castle as a way to ensure that adventurers would find their way there.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR , the halfling adventurer Pawldo and his companion Stefanik sought out the castle after the latter found the Garius knife. The pair dared to delve into the castle seeking treasure, but encountered the monstrous Ketheryll. Garius helped them to fight him off by using its pointing power to help Pawldo determine which of multiple copies was the real Ketheryll.</p>
