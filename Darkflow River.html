<p>The Darkflow River , or simply the Darkflow , was a short river in the Vast Swamp that formed part of the border between Cormyr and Sembia in the east.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The source of the Darkflow lay in the heart of the Vast Swamp, being fed by the marsh-water itself, and it flowed south into the Lake of Dragons .</p>
<p>The regular rains over the Vast Swamp caused the Darkflow to swell and flood the lands beside it.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The river was wide and flowed only sluggishly. As the name suggested, the water was so dark that it was described as "inky". This was a result of sediment, filth, and pollution in the Vast Swamp—the water was not filtered or cleaned as would happen in a natural marsh. As a result, the river-water was foul and stinking.</p>
<h2>Fauna</h2>
<p>The river was home to countless dangerous creatures.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Lizardmen dwelling in the Vast Swamp sometimes ventured down the Darkflow to raid villages.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The village of Battlerise , which stood on the west bank of the Darkflow River, was once beset by lizardmen from the river and monsters emerging from the Vast Swamp. Long before the 1360s DR , its population had plummeted.</p>
