<p>The Lady's Lament was an adventuring troupe from the City of Splendors, Waterdeep , active circa 1310 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Lady's Lament was known for being a group of quiet, soft-spoken, and somewhat melancholic adventurers. They built a reputation of stepping up to help those in need and not being afraid of a challenge, even dangerous tasks other adventuring troupes declined.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Lady's Lament was established several years before the Year of Storms, 1310 DR . The group's first member and leader was Sheris Lyricist , a rich, spoiled, and willful daughter of a Waterdhevian noble house. When faced with a prospect of an arranged marriage organized by her father, Sheris ran away from home and took on a mantle of a bard . Later, she was joined by a half-orcish couple who were not accepted by either humans nor orcs . Geldin and Khatja became the company's muscle. The adventurers later were joined by Laeris , a quiet cleric of Ilmater , a drow sorceress Vraedna who abandoned worship of Lolth and wanted to build a reputation of being a good dark elf, and lastly, a cheerful hin rogue Kylie .</p>
<p>In 1310 DR, the Lady's Lament, along with many other mercenaries, traveled from Luskan to the besieged city of Targos in the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale .</p>
