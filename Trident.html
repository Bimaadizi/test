<p>A trident was a three-pronged martial piercing weapon.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tridents were long poles, generally measuring 4​ to ​8 feet (1.2​ to ​2.4 meters) in length, with a three-pronged fork on the end.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>Tridents were typically used for fishing, though occasionally people used them for hunting or in place of a pitchfork . A trident could be thrown, but it was not as well-balanced as a spear. It also was effective in defending against charges.</p>
