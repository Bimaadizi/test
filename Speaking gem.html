<p>A speaking gem or ahlrekauth was an enchanted gem made by elves that allowed them to communicate at a distance, and which held voice messages from ancient times. They were all but unknown by the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The most ancient of ahlrekauth were elven voice records, some of them more ancient than some celestial bodies. The process to awaken their voices, however, was esoteric even among the magically accomplished loremasters. One particular speaking-gem was made of malachite .</p>
<p>On Evermeet , a different kind of speaking stone was used to communicate.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ahlrekauth were some of the most ancient sources known to have been created by elves . One particular pair of ancient speaking stones in Evermeet was keyed to Chandrelle Durothil and to Brindarry Nierde ; Chandrelle's stone belonged to her father.</p>
<p>Until 1373Â DR , the song dragon Ammaratha Cyndusk kept a collection of over 4,000 speaking gems in a fortress hidden within Claw Peak . She traded those to other dragons , including Aeglyl Dreadclaw , in exchange for them sparing the life of Vangerdahast , the Royal Mage of Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>By the 14 th century, even Vangerdahast had no idea what those were, but they were greatly appreciated by dragons.</p>
