<h2>History</h2>
<p>Reesa was a merchant and Hagen's daughter. Reesa would greet the Kalach-Cha if the Kalach-Cha sided with the Watch. Like her father, she thought the Watch was ineffective, but would gain a better impression of them. Before thieves came, Hagen dismissed her, as she could have been captured.</p>
