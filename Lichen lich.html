<p>A lichen lich was an undead being formed from the remains of powerful, once-living druids .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These liches appeared much like their wizardly counterparts, with a few distinct differences. Their skeletal forms appeared overgrown with fungi, lichen , and other organic growths that resembled tree bark. Rather than any vasculature, the remains of these liches housed winding vines that pumped out some unknown, black viscosity.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like other liches, lichen liches were adept spellcasters. They had access to a variety of spells, including the devastating ability to call down fire storms upon their foes.</p>
<p>Within their personal lair, they could conjure clouds of poisonous spores, instantly grow masses of rotting vines and tree roots, or summon forth shambling mounds .</p>
<p>They were essentially immortal, so long as their phylactery remained intact and preserved. If a lichen lich were ever destroyed, its remains would reform near its phylactery within a manner of days.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Lichen liches possessed several inherent resistances and immunities. They were protected from extreme cold and chill, resisted forms of harmful necrotic energy , and were wholly unaffected by poison . Like other undead they never succumbed to exhaustion and could not be frightened away. In addition they could not be paralyzed , stunned into inaction, or charmed by magical or mundane means.</p>
<p>Their mere touch was quite poisonous and they could wither away any organic material from up to 60 ft (18 m) away. A few times each day, lichen liches could poison other creatures by mere sight, or syphon away their life force. This latter power would restore any damage inflicted upon their undead forms.</p>
