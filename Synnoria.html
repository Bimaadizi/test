<p>Synnoria , also known as Llewyr , was an ancient kingdom that was home to a race of elves known as the Llewyrr . It lay hidden in a high valley within the mountains bordering the Myrloch Vale on Gwynneth , one of the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The valley sat on the southeastern border of the Myrloch Vale where the Highlands and the Cambro Mountains met. It was nearly impossible to locate by outsiders: not only was it surrounded by the rugged and nearly impassable mountains, but it was covered in a powerful mass illusion spell so that, if viewed from above, it simply looked like a continuation of the surrounding mountains. Overland, there were three mountain passes that lead into the realm, but they were narrow and full of false trails and gorges so that they were very difficult to navigate without a guide or very detailed directions. A layer of thick fog—so dense as to almost appear like a solid mass from a distance —added to the treacherousness of attempting to travel into the valley.</p>
<p>At the heart of Synnoria was a circular lake containing a rounded hill on which sat the city of Chrysalis .</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>The woodlands of Synnoria were home to aspen and rhododendron trees. Flitting through the trees were small mirror-moths as well as fireflies the size of fists.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The Most Serene Matriarch, Ate`Niah , oversaw the Elders of the Llewyrr and presided over the elves of Synnoria from the palace of Argen-Tellirynd for centuries. As of the late 15 th century DR , they had pledged fealty to the ruling le Shay of Sarifal .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Synnoria was well-hidden, and any who entered without proper permission or escort were swiftly detained by the elven marchlords. The valley was protected by elite cavalry, known as the Sisters of Synnoria in the 14 th century DR and earlier and the Knights of Synnoria as of the late 15 th century DR.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Llewyrr of Synnoria regarded the humans of the Moonshae Isles with derision and hostility for centuries. While their attitude toward the Ffolk was measured, they regarded the Northmen as outright enemies. Unauthorized entry of a human—or most other non-elves—into Synnoria was seen by some Llewyrr as a defilement of their land.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Synnoria was founded by elves from the Llewyrrwood fleeing the Vyshaan occupation of their homeland in −9800 DR . They were welcomed in the Moonshae Island by the fey of ancient Sarifal, and they named their new realm after the queen who had led them over the sea. When Sarifal retreated into the Feywild circa −500 DR , the Llewyrr remained in their hidden valley.</p>
<p>After the first human settlers arrived in Gwynneth in the 2 nd century DR, they soon came into open conflict with Synnoria. The two groups agreed to a tenuous peace in the Year of the Jealous Hag, 154 DR , after a decade of fighting.</p>
<p>Synnoria was attacked by the Ityak-Ortheel in the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR when Malar and Talos sent it through a portal but the elf-eater was defeated and banished back to the Abyss after it had destroyed Argen-Tellirynd, the Palace of Ages.</p>
<p>Following the return of Sarifal in the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR , Synnoria would once again pledge allegiance to the le Shay. However, beginning in the early 15 th century DR, some among the elves increasingly came to feel that le Shay rule was intolerable, and so some began plotting to overthrow High Lady Ordalf . When a new le Shay heir was born who was also half-Llewyrr, the Princess Amaranth , a plan was hatched to install her on the throne.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The city of Chrysalis was the only real settlement within the valley, and it lay mostly abandoned by the 14 th and 15 th centuries DR. The Llewyrr population steadily decreased due to a low birth rate and deaths by accident or in battle, usually with firbolgs . Legends among the Llewyrr foretold a resurgence would one day bring them back to dominance of the Moonshaes, but they always doubted this legend until it proved true when the entire island of Gwynneth was taken over by the noble eladrin of Sarifal in the early 15 th century DR, leading to humans being banned from its shores.</p>
