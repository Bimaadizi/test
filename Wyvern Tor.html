<p>Wyvern Tor was a crag in the Lost Hills northeast of the Sword Mountains , and was easily seen by any on the Triboar Trail near the vicinity of Conyberry .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Wyvern Tor was formerly inhabited by a vicious nest of wyverns , but they were slain by bold adventurers. By the time of approximately 1491 DR , the place was abandoned by the wyvern nest. Many creatures laid here from time to time, the most prominent of which was a group of orcs and one ogre .</p>
<p>In 1491 DR, the place became the lair of orc scouts of the Many-Arrows tribe. The stories of Phandalin being resettled in this time renewed traffic on the Triboar Trail and attracted the orcs to the area.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Wyvern Tor was originally inhabited by a nest of wyverns, but after they were driven out, many creatures used the place as their lair. By 1480 DR, a group of six orcs led by the leader of the scouting party, Brughor Axe-Biter , inhabited the crag. They also allied themselves with a filthy ogre named Gog .</p>
