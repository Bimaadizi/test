<p>Firmal was a musician member of the Heart of Bane and part of the Bard's Guild of Ravens Bluff in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By Uktar of the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Firmal found his calling as a member of a band that performed in Ravens Bluff. The musician's instrument of choice was something called illithid bagpipes . Firmal found like-minded performers among Everett Taber who played drums of panic , Havoc Sen Thornclaw with the ax of deafening and destruction used as an instrument, Vanduhar Gerenstalt Eisnerâ€Ž and his Illmataran organ of pain , all gathered under the leadership of the Kossuthan priest and the band's lead wailer named Nassar . As a group, they picked a name that would prove highly problematic. The Heart of Bane band was named after the infamous relic of the same name. In Uktar, the Bard's Guild plastered the city with posters that advertised that the Heart of Bane would be making an appearance at a performance aimed at helping the city's morale.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the ill-conceived advertisement attracted the attention of a band of tanar'ri led by a marilith , as the planar being were attracted to the relic's dark magic, plaguing the city at the time. The ensuing slaughter ended the lives of a dozen innocents, and the Bard's Guild was lit aflame, with the guild being severely damaged. The demonic attack was ended by a Golden Rooster Patrol led by Sir Kirth Sonath-Pann . In the fallout of the performance, Firmal and the Heart of Bane band went into hiding, leaving only a spokesperson to proclaim their innocence. The proceedings from the show were never paid to Firmal's group as the Bard's Guild claimed that the box office was ransacked by a nabassu .</p>
