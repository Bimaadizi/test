<p>Hilithiimm had managed the Plumbers' Guild efficiently for many years. Hilithiimm hoped one day to transfer his position to his son Jhalossan Turnstone . However, unknown to anyone, he was mentally enslaved by Nexil'Vendyliq , one of the aboleths of the Savants of the Dark Tide . It permitted Hilithiimm to act normally but had him steer Cellarers away from the aboleth-controlled portions of the sewers and to visit it regularly to renew the enslavement.</p>
