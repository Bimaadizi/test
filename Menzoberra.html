<p>Menzoberra was a drow high priestess of Lolth , who founded the city of Menzoberranzan .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After decades of infighting among the drow of Golothaer , and at the behest of the Spider Queen, who gave her the title Yor'thae (the Chosen) , Menzoberra the Kinless led seven drow families from their southern holdings of Great Bhaerynden into the Northdark .</p>
<p>When escorting the refugees through the caverns, she came across dwarven mines, inhabited by the iron mining Clan Black Axe . The two groups fought in a fierce battle, but eventually Menzoberra's forces prevailed. They, however, took significant losses, and their numbers were halved. As the last dwarf, Dorn Black Axe , fell to the ground, he cursed her invaders and wished upon them "the doom of many eyes".</p>
<p>By −3917 DR , after several years in the dark deeps of the Underdark , the refugees came to a giant cavern inhabited by a swarm of spiders and the legendary beholder , Many Eyes . After a long battle with many losses for the drow, Menzoberra laid the final blow on the beholder. When the battle was over, a yochlol appeared in front of the surviving drow proclaiming the cavern was to be their new home: "Menzoberranzan" in recognition of Menzoberra's service to Lolth.</p>
