<p>H'slaat was a troglodyte warrior in the Wormwrithings area in the late 15 th century DR . He was the war chief and champion of Laogzed in the tribe led by S'slaar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1486 DR , he led a group of his warriors to defeat a drow patrol. The drow leader had a magic sword that was claimed as a trophy by chieftain S'slaar. H'slaat disagreed, saying that it was his by right of killing its owner. Soon a civil war started between S'slaar's and H'slaat's loyalists. H'slaat ordered the capture of H'hoort , the mate of S'slaar. Unless others interrupted them, in the last battle H'slaat would kill S'slaar and become the next chieftain.</p>
