<p>Thornposts was the grand manor home of cartographer Lorimel Rustellur in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Thornposts stood two blocks south from Suzail's grand Promenade on a street that crossed the Court Close that laid to the west from the establishment. The manor stood across the street from the Mare's Tail tavern and two doors west of Taneth's Feasthall . The building was a large L-shaped residence.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 14 th century DR, Thornposts was the destination for those seeking to acquire maps and floor pans of mansions, keeps, and nobles' estates of Cormyr. These maps were available for purchase by anyone who had at least 1,000 gold coins handy. The only types of maps Lorimel Rustellur never sold were of buildings that belonged to the Crown of Cormyr, the Obarskyr royal family or any civic buildings. Lorimel also offered custom map drawing services, but such orders were priced at least at 2,000 gp with 800 gp extra for his travel expenses.</p>
