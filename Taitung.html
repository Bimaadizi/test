Minister of War Kwan Chan Sen led an army out of Tai Tung to face them, but was defeated at the Battle of the Sorghum Field on Tarsakh 30 and the survivors regrouped and returned there. The emperor's summer palace was repurposed as a temporary command center for waging the war, Emperor Kai Tsao Shou Chin came in person to grant command to General Batu Min Ho . The armies camped in a meadow several miles outside the city, as they were too many to be accommodated in the city itself.</p>
