<p>Genius was an owl who lived in Marigold's Menagerie in the mid-14 th century DR . They inhabited one of the few floor-to-ceiling cages within the Menagerie, with half a tree trunk leaning inside of it, alongside a raven by the name of Noble .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Genius was only known to be active in the Menagerie during the night. This was part of the reason for why the two avians largely got along, though they did occasionally squabble with each other.</p>
