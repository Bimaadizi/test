<h2>History</h2>
<p>This enchanted light flail once was wielded by Felina Tatch, a priestess who made it her life's goal to destroy all vile undead. This act was not motivated by hate but rather by the desire to free the suffering should bound to their shambling unholy husks. Eventually, the cleric's crusade brought her to a conflict with vampire Milikaia . She slew and subjugated Felina. However, soon after her death, the undead priestess was seen wandering through the graveyard of her hometown, destroying the undead. Milikaia's fate was unknown.</p>
<p>At some point after Felina's death, Last Rest was broken into two parts, the haft, and the flail head. In 1372 DR , both pieces were discovered by the Hero of Daggerford , one in a pile of "treasures" in Torleth Mindulspeer 's store in Gillian's Hill , and the other in possessions of necromancer Daxiong who laired in the graveyard of Gillian's Hill. The flail was reforged in Daggerford by Derval Ironeater for 2,500 gold pieces.</p>
