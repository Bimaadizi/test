<p>The material component was a basic part of casting most spells .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A material component consisted of one or more physical objects or substances. Depending on the spell, once it was cast, the material component was annihilated. However, a spellcaster could often use a spellcasting focus to substitute for most components, which would not be consumed by the spell. Casters who wielded priestly magic usually used a divine focus such as a holy symbol , which had higher spiritual significance than the standard focus, while druids often employed a druidic focus .</p>
<p>Arcane spellcasters usually employed component pouches with individual compartments to store most material components required for their spells, unless they chose to employ an arcane focus instead.</p>
<p>Valuable or rare material components often had to be stored separately and could not be replaced by a focus.</p>
