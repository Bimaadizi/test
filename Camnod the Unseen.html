<p>Camnod the Unseen was a mysterious entity purported to be one of the ancient Seven Lost Gods and one of the elder evils .</p>
<p>Camnod the Unseen was one of seven demipowers who were defeated by or submitted to the god Bane , the Black Lord, in ancient times, among Borem of the Lake of Boiling Mud ; Maram of the Great Spear ; Haask, Voice of Hargut ; Tyranthraxus the Flamed One ; and two more whose names were lost to history. In Urgund's Description of Darkness , an account by Urgund of his imprisonment in the lower planes , these five entities were "those who fell down and became servants of the great lord Bane" and later sat in his Hall of Minor Courtiers as lesser powers .</p>
