<p>The King's Ride Inn was a quality tavern and inn in the town of King's Reach in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR, The King's Ride Inn was one of two inns in King's Reach. It had better quality rooms and food between the two. It catered mostly to merchants traveling the Vast , who generally were uninterested in mingling with the locals or sharing drinks with adventurers.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Unsurprisingly, The King's Ride Inn offered meals and lodgings to its guests. A room was rented at five gold pieces per night; food was included in the price.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , the inn was run by a single proprietor, and the staff included a waitress.</p>
