<p>Caer Corwell , also called simply Corwell or Corwell Town , was a small city and castle on the isle of Gwynneth that served as the capital of the Ffolk kingdom of Corwell through the late 14 th century DR . It lay abandoned and in ruins as of the late 15 th century DR.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Caer Corwell was said to have been the prettiest city in the Moonshaes during its height, and was small enough to be located mostly on a hill leading down to the port. The city was overlooked by a castle located on a tall rocky cliff that overlooked the waters of the harbor, with terraced sections of the town leading down toward the port from the castle walls.</p>
<p>A large village green to the north spread out below the castle with a druid 's grove, surrounded by a ring of massive oak trees in the center, that also contained a moonwell . The small wooden buildings of the Ffolk were protected by a three-sided low stone wall. A wooden harbor jutting out into the Corwell Firth was used to moor Corwellian fishing boats, barges , coracles and Calishite trading vessels. It was surrounded by storage buildings which the city itself was built around, as well as several stone courtyards connected by cobblestone streets. Buildings nearer to the port were more civic oriented while smaller residential homes were located further inland, with poor neighborhoods sitting uphill along stairs.</p>
<p>Elminster remarked in the mid–14 th century DR that the city's inns, The Boar's Tusk and The Red Stag were fine. The Boar's Tusk was run by an old hunter named Garek and had an almost exclusively male customer base while the Red Stag was run by a former Waterdhavian barmaid named Miriam, who left the city for a rural life. It was a quieter establishment that specialized in savory food.</p>
<p>The town was a crumbling ruin as of the late 15 th century DR. The surviving buildings were stone or brick, but many of these had collapsed. Those that still stood often had collapsed roofs, and their doors and windows sat wide open.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The city was located at the terminus of Corwell Firth, and was said to be the only usable harbor on the west coast of Gwynneth. Just inland from the town were wheat fields and forests, and from atop the hill, Caer Corwell had a clear view of the Highlands to the north.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The harbor was protected by the castle and by guard towers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Caer Corwell was said to be the original site where the ancestors of the Ffolk, led by a woman named Gwynneth , first settled the Moonshaes in the Year of the Impenetrable Mystery, 141 DR . It was long thought of as the heart of the Moonshaes.</p>
<p>During the events of the Darkwalker War in the Year of the Saddle, 1345 DR , the beast Kazgaroth assumed the form of the Northlander king Thelgaar Ironhand and led and invasion of Caer Corwell. The ensuing Battle of Caer Corwell saw the death of King Byron Kendrick and the overrun of the town. However, Prince Tristan Kendrick organized the survivors behind the walls of the castle, and a fortuitous intervention by The Pack broke the siege and saved the town.</p>
<p>The city was attacked again the next year by the armies of Bhaal in the Second Battle of Caer Corwell . Even with the help of allies among the Ffolk and Northmen, the town was quickly overrun, and was only saved when Bhaal was banished by the newly crowned High King Tristan wielding the Sword of Cymrych Hugh .</p>
<p>Following the rise of Sarifal in the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR , the great city fell into decline as the fey began to encroach on its holdings. After the United Moonshae Isles came into conflict with Amn over the island of Snowdown in the Year of the Sceptered One, 1404 DR , Amnian mercenaries subsequently put Corwell to the torch, creating the opportunity for High Lady Ordalf of Sarifal to declare that all humans were to be expelled from Gwynneth in the Year of the Dauntless Dwarves, 1412 DR . The fey subsequently laid siege to Caer Corwell, sinking all the ships in the port, putting to death any members of the Kendrick family, and enslaving or killing the inhabitants—including children—and hanging their bodies from the battlements.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR , human visitors still were not permitted on Gwynneth and the Caer Corwell was a ruin largely inhabited by beasts and unseelie fey . High Lady Ordalf of Sarifal also maintained a small and hidden prison beneath the ruins where she kept captives whom she intended either to have killed or to be simply forgotten.</p>
<p>In the late 1470s DR, Lord Aldon Kendrick —a cousin to the High King—strong-armed the crew of the Sphinx to take him to Caer Corwell on a mission to secure the loyalty of the Winterglen Claw , a human rebel group. However, this was a trap laid by his rivals within his own family, who notified High Lady Ordalf of his arrival.</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , High King Derid Kendrick of Callidyrr felt that it was a point of both pride and necessity to reestablish a foothold at his family's former seat. He was engaged in negotiations with Ordalf's son to secure permission to establish an embassy at Caer Corwell. However, High Lady Ordalf refused to allow this, and continued to do so through at least 1489 DR .</p>
