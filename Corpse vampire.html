<p>Corpse vampires , also known as pouncing vampires by halflings , were a type of vampire that emerged in the Realms following the Spellplague . The corpse of a humanoid could potentially arise as one of these if they were buried improperly, left in a place that was polluted by evil energies, or were robbed of their burial possessions.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Corpse vampires had pale skin, slowly decaying forms, and a feral appearance. They were rather slow moving, except when pouncing around.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Corpse vampires retained the memories of their former life. They often sought to victimize the friends and relatives they had in life.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like most vampires, these creatures possessed an immunity to diseases and poisons , they could see in areas of total darkness , and they could drain the blood of their victims.</p>
<p>Any humanoid that died from having their blood drained from them by a corpse vampire would arise as one themselves on the following day's sunset. Though if a humanoid died from a corpse vampire by any other means, they would instead arise as a zombie . These transformations could be prevented by reviving those slain, or otherwise by burning or decapitating their bodies.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Besides their fangs, corpse vampires fought with sharp claws. They typically leaped upon their prey, most often doing so from a higher vantage point.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Unlike some vampires, corpse vampires did not rest within coffins during daylight hours. They would instead burrow into loose soil and take a rest under the earth.</p>
<h3>Homelands</h3>
<p>In the Shadowfell , corpse vampires could be found in Evernight and the Burning Woods , that plane 's reflections of Neverwinter and the Neverwinter Woods respectively.</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>Corpse vampires spoke in bestial tones, often in the Common language.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Corpse vampires frequently went hunting with other forms of undead or other nocturnal creatures.</p>
