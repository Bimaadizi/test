<p>The House of the Morninglord in Bryn Shander was the town's place of worship for the Keeper of the Eternal Sun, Amaunator . It was overseen by the devout and irrepressible cleric Mithann .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The shrine was located in the northeastern region of the city, a ways off from its central market square.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The shrine was established in a small converted house.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Mithann offered a view on Amaunator that differed from the cities of the south. She cast away the austere and unyielding traits typically associated with the deity, and sought to cast him in a more uplifting light.</p>
<h3>Activities</h3>
<p>While the sun did not shine over the Ten Towns for two months of the year , its return in the month of Hammer was a joyous occasion. The church sponsored a grand feast to celebrate the occasion every year.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , the House of the Morninglord offered shelter to the Lathanderite gnome Copper Knobberknocker after he had enough staying at the isolated Black Cabin .</p>
