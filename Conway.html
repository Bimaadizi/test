<h2>History</h2>
<p>Shortly before the Time of Troubles , on Eleint 16 , 1358 DR , Maerovyna of the Harvest House in Daggerford was investigating a slew of murders and child abductions that all converged on the monastery in Liam's Hold. The true nature of the monastery was uncovered, and a small strike force of Chauntea 's followers, rangers, and Misty Forest elves assembled. The leader of the assault was the ranger Conway.</p>
<p>The assault ended with defeat. The attackers were all slain, and Conway was gravely wounded. His body was the only one never recovered following the disastrous attack. After being hurt, Conway used his magic boots to escape. He found a way into the crypts underneath Liam's Hold and there died of his injuries. Conway's skeletal remains were still in the crypts in 1372 DR .</p>
