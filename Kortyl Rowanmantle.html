<p>Kortyl Rowanmantle was a knight and a member of the Rowanmantle noble family in Cormyr who rode with Princess Alusair Obarskyr . He was a brash youth.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Alusair and her knights were operating in the Stonelands, pursuing a bold orc band that had raided a caravan east of Eveningstar ; in six days of pursuit, they'd killed a hydra , a " fire lizard ", and three chimeras . They were on a high meadow north of Startop Crag when the knights impetuously pursued the orcs into an ambush, and a few were killed. Alusair rallied her forces to defeat the orcs and their dark naga master.</p>
<p>Afterward, Kortyl teased Brace Skatterhawk over stories he was the illegitimate son of King Azoun IV . He claimed not to be afraid that Alusair might be listening, and lost his nerve when it turned out she was. She pushed him over to much laughter.</p>
