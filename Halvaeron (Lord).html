<p>Lord Halvaeron was a nobleman of Cormyr in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He and Lord Torchmore came to Manshoon 's attention in Mirtul of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , as lords who supposedly led factions but whose intrigues and supporters were largely unknown. This was so much so that Glathra Barcantle was also especially curious about them in the aftermath of the massacre during the Council of the Dragon in late Mirtul of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR .</p>
