<p>Bagh nakh of punishment were enchanted tiger's claw weapons from Zakhara , created out of ammut claws.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Bagh nakh of punishment possessed a +1 enchantment that guided the weapons towards the target and made their slashes more deadly. However, their magic became a +3 enchantment when used against creatures of evil nature. Additionally, when wielded against evil targets, the claws acted as a sword of life stealing , sapping the life energy from the enemy and invigorating the wielder. When an evil creature was killed by bagh nakh of punishment , the claws released a loud roar, the same roar an ammut would unleash in battle. Apart from the thunderous sound, the roar also attracted all ammut who heard the roar within 1 mile (1,600 meters) from the weapons. And if an ammut saw these claws made out of a fellow ammut's corpse, it attacked savagely with vengeance. Lastly, once an evil creature was killed with the claws, the weapons and their wielder began reeking of an oily smell of decay for a day.</p>
