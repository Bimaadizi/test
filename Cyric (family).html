<p>The Cyric family were a Ffolk royal line in the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Like all royal families of the Moonshaes, the Cyrics traced their lineage to the Cymrych family of High Kings and Queens. However, following the decline of the Cymrych dynasty in the 10 th century DR, they changed the spelling and pronunciation of their name in order to distance themselves from the mythic Cymrych Hugh and to better differentiate themselves from other Cymrych families.</p>
