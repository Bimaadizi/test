<p>A staff of striking was a very rare magic quarterstaff .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Staves of striking were made of timber from an oak tree.</p>
<p>Only those with knowledge of arcane and/or divine magic , such as mages and clerics , could wield such staves.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>They were magic weapons with a +3 enchantment, and were particularly good at penetrating physical defenses. If a set of armor was prone to being bludgeoned, the staff striking it would act as a bludgeoning weapon, etc .</p>
<p>As did many other magical weapons, staves of striking had a certain number of charges. The staff could expend up to three charges on a single hit. The more charges used, the more additional damage was done. It was possible for the staff to become unenchanted when its last charge was spent. Shorter versions of these staves were simply called rods of striking , but otherwise they had the exact same effects.</p>
