<p>The Temple of Sharess in Bezantur was a decadent and debauched place of worship dedicated to Sharess .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple was located in northern-central Bezantur, the so-called "City of a Thousand Temples" in Thay . Appropriately, it was adjacent to other temples, most immediately Loviatar's Manor across the street to the south and the House of Iyachtu Xvim across the street to the east.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The main temple was an octagonal structure with a large dome. Several smaller hexagonal shrines radiated from this central building.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The temple hosted daily sermons about the importance of enjoying life to the fullest, and advocated for worldly pleasure and excess. Each tenday , the temple hosted a "High Worship" ceremony which was just a massive party at which revelers overate, overdrank, and overindulged in all manner of pleasures of the flesh.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Worship of Sharess was somewhat new in Bezantur as of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , and the temple stood out as one of the few dedicated to a chaotic good deity in the city. However, two factors made her worship suitable to the city's inhabitants: her association with Shar and the fact that Bezantur was a decadent city, thus the hedonism preached at the temple strongly resonated with many residents. As of the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , the temple was one of the most popular and fastest growing congregations in the city, and was stealing popularity away from the worship of both Loviatar and Sune . The Temple of Sune even retaliated by spreading rumors that Sharess's congregation was uncivilized and crude.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, the temple was run by high priest Haldran and his acolytes.</p>
