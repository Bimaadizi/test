<p>Sunset Isle , or sometimes simply Sunset , was a small island in the Moonshae Isles archipelago.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Sunset was the westernmost of the Moonshaes, laying in the Trackless Sea due west of Moray . The terrain was largely mountainous but included forested hillocks and glens.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>The forests of Sunset included weir trees and ferns . These were home to families of tressym , which had become more rare by the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, there were no notable settlements on Sunset, although it was considered to be part of the lands inhabited by the Ffolk .</p>
<p>When the Spellplague struck in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , one of the first clear signs of the coming conjunction between Toril and Abeir was the sudden retreat of the Trackless Sea from the Moonshaes, which the Earthmother first detected at Sunset Isle when the waterline dropped by 30 feet (9.1 meters).</p>
