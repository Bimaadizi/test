<p>The Blue Lynx Adventurers were an adventuring troupe for hire from the Sword Coast North in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the Blue Lynx Adventurers were hired by Lady Jannath to search for her missing consort, a painter of some renown, Oskar Fevras . The group was paid one thousand gold pieces for the service and one thousand more in incidentals. The band returned empty-handed, no trace of Oskar was found from Baldur's Gate to Waterdeep , which was not surprising as he was captured and enslaved by a gang of Zhentarim smugglers and kept in the Zhentarim hideout underneath Waukeen's Rest inn in the Chionthar Valley .</p>
