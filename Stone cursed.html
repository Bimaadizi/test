<p>Stone cursed were humanoids that had been turned to stone and reanimated through alchemical rituals.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Stone cursed were the statue-like remains of those who had been petrified and had a dim echo of life restored via a foul alchemical ritual.</p>
<p>During this ritual, a fist-sized obsidian skull was formed within the stone cursed's torso. It was not visible from the outside, but survived if the stone cursed was destroyed. This skull held a dim echo of the original being's memories and could be extracted by a skilled magic-wielder.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Stone cursed were imbued with a strong, malevolent drive to slay the living. However, they were beholden to their creator and would follow their commands as best they can.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>An alchemical sludge was produced from the claw-like fingers of a stone cursed, which petrified anything scratched by them.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Stone cursed were created through an alchemical ritual that involved the blood of a basilisk and the ashes of a cockatrice 's feathers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Several groups of stone cursed were encountered inside Father Llymic 's prison in the Thunder Peaks , many being the very guards maintaining his prison that had succumbed to the foul curses of the elder evil .</p>
