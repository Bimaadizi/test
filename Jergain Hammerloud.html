<p>Jergain Hammerloud was a famous dwarven warrior who was the reason for the creation of bullets of screaming some years before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jergain Hammerloud was renowned for his battle prowess and terrifyingly loud battlecries. The dwarf felt hopeless and depressed after he suffered an injury and lost his voice. To elevate Jergain's spirits, his clan's clerics forged the first bullets of screaming and imbued them with the dwarf's powerful battlecries. This symbolic gesture brought Jergain so much joy that he continued using this enchanted ammunition until the day he died in battle.</p>
<p>By late 14 th century DR , bullets of screaming gained some fame for their potent sonic damage and could be found in some of the Sword Coast 's blacksmith shops as far north as the Ten Towns , cementing Jergain Hammerloud's legacy.</p>
