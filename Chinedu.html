<p>Chinedu was a handmaiden of Araushnee who helped to maintain a shrine to her goddess beneath Citadel Umbra in the Moonshae Isles as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Chinedu and her sisters maintained a shrine in the tunnels beneath Citadel Umbra dedicated to Araushnee, which was unusual in its dense use of plants that made the air uncomfortably thick with oxygen . Their theology was confusing to outsiders: a heavy focus was placed on Aurushnee's innocence and impending redemption from the " curse " placed on her by Corellon , which had transformed her into Lolth , she considered them to be two of up to four distinct aspects of her goddess. They believed that the Earthmother would soon help to restore Araushnee to her old self and to her rightful place within the elven pantheon .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Her sisters and fellow handmaidens of Araushnee were Amaka , Kemdelime , and Onyiye , with Amaka being the nominal leader of the group. Their father was a warlock and the leader of a drow mercenary army who served Prince Araithe of Sarifal at Citadel Umbra during the 15 th century DR.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Chinedu and her sisters received visions in the late 1470s DR heralding the arrival of Lady Amaranth via a portal from Moray that deposited them into their shrine. These visions, seemingly given by the Earthmother, led them to believe that the time of their goddess's return was joyously imminent.</p>
