<p>Brimstone, the Heart of the Dracolich was a powerful magical orb made from the heart of Karliath found in Myth Drannor in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Cult of the Dragon created Brimstone from the heart of the dracolich Karliath during its ritual of undeath. It was steeped in the powers of destruction, entropy, and annihilation, greatly improving spells that dealt with acid , electricity, sound waves, and cold, with a special focus on empowering fire, negative energy , and poison ; it also sheltered the bearer from any destructive effects that might befall them. The necromantic spells of the bearer were given the boon of crushing despair , ineffably sapping the will to live from anyone affected by them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The orb was made from the very heart of Karliath, and transformed into a powerful implement. It was later recovered from the Cult of the Dragon base hidden in Myth Drannor after the Cormanthor Elves attacked the Red Wizards of Kathul Sep and Droic Orgul there.</p>
