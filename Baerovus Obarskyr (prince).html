<h2>Description and Personality</h2>
<p>As a young man, Baerovus was described as being of slim build, with long hair that he hid his face behind, save for official appearances of the royal family. He was meek and did not desire the throne. He disliked magic and the battlefield. He liked animals, tending to wounded ones he found in royal hunts. He had a particular interest in light horses , enjoying a large stable of them. The calamite breed was his personal favorite .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The prince was a bad swordsman, and wasn't considered useful wielding any blade other then a hunting knife. However, his skills with bow and arrow knew no equal among his royal kin .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Baerovus Azoun Obaskyr was born in 1454 DR , he was the son of then Crown Prince Irvel Obaskyr and his wife, Ospra Goldfeather . Throughout his youth and even into adulthood, Baerovus lived during the reign of his paternal grandfather, King Foril I , being the second in-line prince, only preceded in the line of succession by his father, Irvel.</p>
<p>Even during those years, Baerovus did not desire to rule Cormyr, but up until at least 1479 DR , he wasn't planning to abdicate the throne when it passed to him. He secretly hoped that when his grandfather eventually passed, that his father would live for very long, and that perhaps his future children, or those of his sister Raedra , could then succeed him .</p>
<p>Baerovus' hopes didn't come to pass. He became the Crown Prince when King Foril I died in his sleep in Eleint 5 , 1486 DR and his father became the king. Despite his previous intentions, when King Irvel died on Uktar 14 that same year during the siege of Suzail, Baerovus abdicated the throne in favor of Princess Raedra , who became Queen of Cormyr .</p>
