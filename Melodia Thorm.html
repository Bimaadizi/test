<p>Melodia Thorm was a half-elf of House Thorm , a follower of Selûne , and the wife of General Ketheric Thorm , as well as the mother of Isobel Thorm .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to 986 DR , Melodia married Ketheric Thorm , and the marriage was a genuine love match. The union bore a daughter, named Isobel Thorm . Morfred , the individual whom Ketheric commissioned to build Moonrise Towers , believed that it was through Melodia's influence that Ketheric converted from his previous deity to Selûne, Melodia's patron. At some point, Melodia died of an illness, leaving a grief-stricken Ketheric to raise Isobel alone, though Isobel would soon die after her mother. In his grief, Ketheric abandoned Selûne and turned to Shar , beginning a plan to eliminate all Selûnite presence within Reithwin , with this eventually concluding by 1373 DR .</p>
<p>Despite this, however, Ketheric still thought highly of his late wife, and believed she would not recognize the man she loved if she were still alive. Isobel likewise shared his sentiment, and reflected she missed her greatly. Several busts, whether contemporary or not, with Melodia's likeness were found within Moonrise Towers as of 1492 DR , and one existed in Isobel's former room. Isobel also had a painting of her parents in her possession.</p>
