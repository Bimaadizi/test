<p>Dannath's Pickles, Nuts, & Foods was a shop located in the city of Yartar on the Savage Frontier in northwest Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Operation</h2>
<p>It was owned and run by Alukk Dannath and his three daughters. His daughters were all Harpers .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Dannath's Pickles, Nuts, & Foods specialized in providing foods suitable for travelers in the North, that were otherwise scarce in the area. These included dried apricots , figs , and garshells from the Tashalar and the lands around the Lake of Steam . The foods were of good quality to suit the high prices.</p>
<p>Dannath found any foods close to spoiling and converted them into another, longer lasting form, such as adding overripe fruits in a wine or a syrup mash.</p>
<p>Dannath's daughters also offered aid and sanctuary to Harpers in the building's cellars. The cellars led to tunnels running under Yartar, exiting in several places, like Wink and the Kiss festhall.</p>
