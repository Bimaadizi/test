<p>A blood apricot was an uncommon magical fruit that grew from trees in the Prime Material in areas that had once been the site of bloody scenes of mass barbarism. These trees were often transplanted beyond the Material Plane to Baator , where they were cultivated by devils .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These deep orange-red fruits were named in part for heavily resembling apricots not only in appearance, but in taste. However, they were said to have a richer taste than apricots, with a subtle flavor of iron . If watered with large volumes of blood, these fruits would take on a darker hue and their taste would further resemble blood.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>If a blood apricot had been bled upon within 12 hours prior to its consumption, it would act to supplement the body's natural healing processes. However, if the fruit had not absorbed any blood within 12 hours prior to being consumed, it would only provide a minor healing effect.</p>
