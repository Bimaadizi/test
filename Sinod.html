<p>Sinod was an Overseer of the Cult of the Dragon circa 1369 DR during the occupation of the ruins of Myth Drannor who reported to Kya Mordrayn herself.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sinod was one of the cultists who were led by Kya Mordrayn in 1369 DR into the ruins of the ancient elven city to take control of a pool of radiance in the basement of Castle Cormanthor . He ordered lieutenant Garesh to hunt down a band of orog mercenaries who rebelled against their cultist masters who were stripping souls off their kin, tuning them into subservient living zombie -like creatures. According to the notes left behind in the Elven Catacombs , Sinod threatened Garesh with Kya Mordrayn's thinning patience because of the lieutenant's inability to handle the orog problem.</p>
