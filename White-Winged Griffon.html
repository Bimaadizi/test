<p>The White-Winged Griffon , known locally as the Whitewings , was a rundown inn found in the city of Yartar .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>It was an old and drafty wooden house that offered little comfort from the frigid winds of the North . Privacy was granted by the thin partitions, which did little more than separate each room.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>As of the 14 th century DR , it was infested with rats .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Whitewings offered small single-bed rooms of poor quality for the rock-bottom fee of 1 cp per night. Use of the soap bucket however, had an exorbitant fee of 1 gp .</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the inn did offer services to individuals other than its patrons. Its proprietors were informants for the Zhentarim and the Hand of Yartar , and regularly fed them information regarding those that stayed within their establishment.</p>
