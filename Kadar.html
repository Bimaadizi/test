<p>Kadar was a fallen empire in the land of Zakhara and considered to be one of the two first great civilizations in that land.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This empire was situated in the jungles around the Nogaro River and the adjacent river valleys, southeast of the Haunted Lands and south of World Pillar Mountains and Jungle of Monsters .</p>
<p>The Plateau of the Gate, a site that would later be occupied by the city of Dihliz , marked the entrance to their empire and was guarded by an earth monolith . Beneath some of the ruins of this civilization were a deep and vast network of underground tunnels, stretching into Zakhara's Underdark .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kadar was believed to be older than the other known lost empire in the region, Nog , having been founded a thousand years prior to it by Geomancers . Their rule was eventually toppled by missionaries of the Enlightenment , a band of farisans later referred to as the Lions of Yesterday . They destroyed all but one member of the nine ruling elite, Tisan Balshareska , who withdrew to a secret stronghold named Tadabbur . After sealing its entrance with a mighty enchanted seal, Suhail min Zann and the rest of the Lions of Yesterday would go on to destroy all traces of the Geomancers, breaking their talismans and burning their records. After they departed, the resulting power vacuum was filled by a dynasty of corrupt khedives and worship of the savage goddess known as Ragarra peaked.</p>
<p>Much like Nog, historians in Zakhara considered the history of Kadar to be convoluted and confusing. This was because it seemed to have gone through several different dynasties, which may or may not have simultaneously ruled different regions along the Nogaro. And because the Lions of Yesterday had so efficiently removed all traces of the Geomancers' existence. Some sages believed that Kadarasto was once its capital. Whether or not Kadar and Nog were considered enemies was one of many aspects of their history that historians in Zakhara were uncertain of.</p>
<p>Unlike some regions in Zakhara, both Kadar and Nog resisted the faith of Enlightenment. During their empire's decline, the rulers of Kadar recognized the cult of Ragarra to be a subversive element to society. They outlawed the faith, making public worship a public offense, and laid waste to any of the savage goddess's temples within the empire.</p>
<p>Some tried to claim that genies were created to punish both Kadar and Nog for being sacrilege, or that genies were initially unleashed upon the Prime Material plane for this reason. Some believed that the two empires tampered with forbidden gods deep beneath the earth and were subsequently destroyed by black clouds of vengeance . While others proposed it was most likely that their empires eventually fell due to a combination of corruption, greed, and exclusion from the West.</p>
<p>Those who believed that genie were responsible told that a minor power among the Zakharan pantheon traveled throughout the cities of both empires in a mortal disguise and warned them that the Great Gods were angry with them. After being met with ridicule and thrown stones, the wisest among the pantheon suggested that they appoint the genies to be their generals and carry out their will. But another minor power among the pantheon traveled to the empires once more and warned them of the cleansing to come. Managing to convince some, he took those few away on ships with their great treasures to what would be known as the Steaming Isles . Some believed that inhabitants of both empires also fled to the island of Jazirat al-Gawwar .</p>
<p>The historical legacy of Kadar was survived by many inscriptions, writings, and magical artifacts . Around 1367 DR , active members of the Society of Shifting Sands were searching the ruins of this empire for magical artifacts .</p>
<h2>Culture & Society</h2>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>During the reign of the Geomancers the worship of Grumbar was significant, with every member of the nobility being trained to be a priest in his service. Following their fall, new religious ideas emerged within the empire.</p>
<p>The people of Kadar both feared and revered nature, including the Nogaro River itself. Living idols were considered to be remnants of their civilization's faith. In addition to Ragarra, they were known to worship a variety of savage gods, though only Kiga and Shajar would survive into the 14 th century DR.</p>
