When a famous writer Volothamp Geddarm returned to the Gate after misadventures in the Emerald Grove and coming face-to-face with the Absolute's army, Volo became a target for Churg and his gang. The master traveler was captured by Imprudence's gang and tied to a stack of smokepowder barrels, ready to be "brought to justice" for being an alleged agent of the Absolute at the hands of the gang and street gawkers. When a band known as the Absolute Adversaries interrupted the street execution, Imprudence, Churg Elvek, and the rest of the gang attacked the adventurers but were defeated.</p>
