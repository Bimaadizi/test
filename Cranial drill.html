<p>A cranial drill was a surgical tool used to make a hole in a person's skull, or possibly just in wood.</p>
<h2>Use</h2>
<p>It was used to drill a hole in a patient's skull to release cranial pressure and thus alleviate persistent and extreme headaches or madness. This should of course only be performed by a skilled surgeon with a steady hand, or a carpenter in a pinch. This was not without risk: it could deteriorate the patient's mental capacity, do nothing, or even actually relieve the symptoms. And if there was a slip, it could kill the patient, but at least the condition would be cured. While some were understandably dubious of the benefit and safety of this, others swore it was effective, occasionally.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Only one model of cranial drill was sold through Aurora's Emporium and the Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue . It had a gnome -crafted ratchet mechanism and a robust iron construction, and was valued at only 10 gp .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At Bryn Goldtooth 's shop in Ghars , Cormyr , circa 1367 DR , there was once offered for sale a variety of cranial drills (used).</p>
