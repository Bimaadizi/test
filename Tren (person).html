<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR, Tren was one of the unfortunate villagers captured by the Cult of the Dragon's slavers. Alongside Wenta , Jorsh , and Ristim , the folk were taken to the Cult's slave pens in the ruined Darnarest's tower . Most of the abducted folk were transported to the ruins of Myth Drannor to work in the Cult's excavations or to be turned into undead servants. Even though Tren's fate remained unknown, the Cult's nefarious plan was stopped by a group of adventurers sent to search for the missing townies as well as the group known as the Veiled Ones .</p>
