<p>Omala was a master colorist at the dye works in Port Nyanzaru in Chult during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the same time as the death curse , Omala purchased dancing monkey fruit from the black market for the purpose of making dye . Such an act was considered a potentially capital offense (punishable by a sentence to Executioner's Run ) as it circumvented the legal sale of fruit overseen by the merchant prince Kwayothé . When Omala's actions were uncovered by the Ytepka Society , he planned to go to Goldenthrone to plead for his life before Kwayothé, claiming he had merely experienced a lapse of judgment. He sought to ask adventurers to accompany him for protection, although he lacked the money to hire any.</p>
