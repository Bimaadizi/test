<p>Sancitified magic was a type of magic.</p>
<p>Sanctified magic required the caster to be completely and utterly devoted to good. Sanctified spells were incredibly powerful. However, they could only be cast with a significant sacrifice from the caster. Evil spellcasters were unable to cast any sanctified spell.</p>
<p>Sanctified spells were prepared just as normal spells. Unprepared sanctified spells could only be used from a scroll. Sanctified spells usually required verbal and somatic components but rarely a material component . Some also required a divine focus . All sanctified spells were temporary and expired.</p>
<p>All sanctified spells required a sacrifice from the caster. The sacrifice required varied, from a temporary draining of the caster's strength to their life itself. The sacrifice occured when the spell expired.</p>
<p>A sanctified spell could be made into an item, such as a potion, scroll or wand. Any individual of good-alignment could use said item, and the required sacrifice was taken from them instead of the individual who created the item.</p>
<p>Sanctified spells were unique in that they were neither an arcane nor a divine spell. Good-aligned druids , paladins , rangers , sorcerers and wizards could all cast a sanctified spell, but clerics can spontaneously cast any sanctified spell.</p>
