<p>The Han languages were a group of languages spoken in Kara-Tur .</p>
<p>It comprised a number of languages descended from the root Han language , including Koryo , Kozakuran , and Wa-an , and possibly others.</p>
<p>Kozakuran and Wa-an remained closely related; some considered them only different dialects of the same language. There was perhaps 65% comprehension between the two.</p>
<p>Koryo's vocabulary comprised many words evolved from the old Han tongue, as well as loanwords from Wa-an and Kao te Shou that had been borrowed over centuries. Koryo's vocabulary was very different to that of Kozakuran, but its grammar was very similar. Koryo sounded more like Wa-an than Kao te Shou, but it was as simple to use as Shou.</p>
<p>Thus most folk of Shou Lung , Wa , and even Kozakura found the Koryo language relatively easy to pick up, and most Koryoans in turn found Kao te Shou, Wa-an, and Kozakuran easy to learn as well.</p>
