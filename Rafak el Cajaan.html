<p>Rafak el Cajaan was a Calishite noble and the leader of a group of dragonslayers in the Third Age of Calimshan .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Rafak was famous for leading a group of his family members against the Rose Dragon Ylveraasahlisar , who had ruled Calimshan for 112 years. In −1726 DR , his band wounded her and drove her out of Calimport , where she was subsequently slain by the bronze dragon Cadasalmpar .</p>
<p>Afterward, great infighting began in the Cajaan family over which of them would rule. This fighting lasted eighteen years and resulted in the death of all males except one. Historians are not certain whether the one survivor who began ruling in −1708 DR was Rafak or not.</p>
