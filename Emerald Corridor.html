<p>The Emerald Corridor was the main trade route in Chondath that stretched along the Vilhon Reach from the city of Arrabar to Hlath , and further to Reth .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Emerald Corridor was established before the Year of the Resolute Courtesans, 139 DR by Arrabar. Originally a busy pathway, it quickly became a major trade route. In 139 DR, the city of Shamph was erected along the corridor to be used as a storage and transporting stop for the busy Chondathan lumbering operations in the Chondalwood .</p>
<p>The Year of the Thirsty Sword, 900 DR was marked by the raging Rotting Wars â€”a bloody civil war in Chondath. The first skirmish that sparked the conflict took place on the Emerald Corridor, south of the River Nun , between the allied armies of Reth and Hlath against the forces of Neveris Bikou , the ruler of Chondath.</p>
<p>The Emerald Corridor continued being a tumultuous trade route in the late 14 th century DR as the cities of Hlath and Iljak engaged in a series of small-scale armed conflicts and raids against each other. This trade interruption only played into the hands of Arrabar and Shamph by sending merchants to their safer markets.</p>
