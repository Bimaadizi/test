<p>Lord Mindarion was a leader among the Knights of Synnoria on the island of Gwynneth in the Moonshae Isles , although he abandoned them during the late 15 th century DR . He was a key participant in a Synnorian plot to overthrow the ruling le Shay of Sarifal .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was a very old Llewyrr high elf , with high and effeminate cheek bones, bright eyes, and a long nose. His skin and hair were pale, and following a great injury and massive expenditure of his magical power, his skin turned ashen and his hair was streaked with gray.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Mindarion had an easy demeanor, even when he was not smiling. He drank and savored water as if it were wine .</p>
<p>He was an optimist who was frequently disillusioned with the malaise that his fellow elves developed over the course of their long lifespans. He was willing to overlook ancient enmities for the benefit of a brighter future, but regretted that few of his kin shared this willingness.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Mindarion was a potent spellcaster, able to shield himself and his allies from spells and to attack with explosive, elemental power sufficient to level whole sections of forest. However, given his advanced age, he risked exhausting himself if he called upon too much power, potentially leaving him nearly comatose.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Mindarion plotted the downfall of High Lady Ordalf of Sarifal, and kept tabs on her forces and her schemes.</p>
<p>He was held in high esteem among the Knights of Synnoria prior to his departure from Synnoria. He regarded one of his comrades, Lord Askepel , to be a particularly egregious example of how the long years of Llewyrr's lifespan could strip someone of their emotion and their love of life. By contrast, he appreciated the urgency of humans and other shorter-lived races , and as such he was known to work alongside Captain Rurik of the Winterglen Claw . He also sought cordial relations with the princess Marabaldia and lord Ughoth of the fomorian tribes who dwelt beneath Sarifal.</p>
<p>He had a daughter named Altaira . His niece was the half-le Shay princess of Sarifal, Lady Amaranth .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mindarion had committed his life to overthrowing the sovereigns of Sarifal. He and his fellow conspirators operated out of an abandoned fortress known as Harrowfast that sat on the border of Synnoria. His brother, also a Knight of Synnoria, was killed by Prince Araithe of the le Shay following the birth of Amaranth in the late 1450s DR, whose mother had been the le Shay princess Callia . Amaranth would subsequently disappear after a botched plot to smuggle her out of Sarifal and away from the machinations of the le Shays, and when she was found again in the late 1470s DR, Mindarion made it his mission to make her the new queen of Sarifal. He believed that the only way to motivate his kin to action against their tyrant rulers was to also promise one of their own on the throne. At the same time, he was attempting to broker an alliance with Lord Ughoth and his nine fomorian tribes, without whom the Knights of Synnoria simply would not have the numbers to fight the le Shay.</p>
<p>Upon hearing rumors that High Lady Ordalf had learned of Amaranth's location from a prisoner, Mindarion and a handful of his knights joined Captain Rurik and his men to investigate. They tracked Prince Ariathe to the ruins of Caer Corwell as he also investigated the same rumors, and successfully rescued the prisoner, Poke , from Araithe's drow , alongside a fomorian princess named Marabaldia and a gnome named Suka . On their return journey to Harrowfast, Mindarion learned of Amaranth's activities from Poke before she was slain by a drow darkwalker . Defeating the darkwalker took all of Mindarion's strength, and by the time they reached Harrowfast, he was fading quickly and was unable to continue his role in negotiating an alliance between the Knights of Synnoria, the humans of the Winterglen Claw, and the fomorians.</p>
<p>With Mindarion falling into slumber, he was tended to by his daughter Altaira, who believed he was likely to "turn inward" for several years as he recovered. With him unable to participate, negotiations were led by Lord Askepel, who was unable or unwilling to acknowledge the grievances of the humans and fomorians nor the extent to which his Knights required their aid. When negotiations broke down and violence broke out, the humans fled Harrowfast and the elves attacked the fomorians. Mindarion was forcibly roused from his slumber by Suka, and he made a snap decision to take the side of the fomorians by helping them to escape to the Underdark . Giving up on the stubbornness of his people, he resolved to leave them behind, although he invited Altaira to join him in his coming odyssey.</p>
