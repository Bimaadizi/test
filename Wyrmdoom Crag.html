<p>Wyrmdoom Crag was a goliath settlement nestled within the Spine of the World mountains in the North . It was home to the warm and outgoing Thuunlakalaga clan.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The caverns of Wyrmdoom Crag were carved within a tall mountain, with a cave mouth that faced the north.</p>
<p>Wyrmdoom Crag featured a central sleeping chamber, encircled by a number of caves that served other functions. The settlement's leader, Chief Ogolai , and a few other venerated warriors had private chambers that branched off to the east.</p>
<p>"The Crawl" was a chamber that featured a small tunnel with walls that were inscribed with a number of runes , an important site for goliaths that were about to come of age.</p>
<p>In the innermost chamber of Wyrmdoom Crag was a wide and open feasting hall.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It was located among the western slopes of the Spine mountains, some ways southwest of the Reghed Glacier .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>As with other goliath settlements, Wyrmdoom Crag was led by a single chieftain.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>The Thuunlakalaga goliaths were very welcoming to outsiders, save for the goliaths of the Akannathi clan.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Shortly after the settlement's founding, a white dragon called Stygiarus assaulted the goliaths at their home. Unfortunately for the dragon, it greatly underestimated the clan's strength and was defeated and slain.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Word about Stygiarus's death and remains spread as far away as the Ten Towns . The scholar Dannika Graysteel sought out these dragon bones for the formulation of a potent stew with magical properties.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In addition to the goliaths, a small number of chwingas dwelled in and around the caves of the crag.</p>
