<p>Velasta, like her sister, was an adaptive combatant and could adjust her tactics effectively when given the opportunity or when prepared.</p>

<p>As a member of House T'sarran , Velasta was outfitted with gear befitting a priestess of her station. She wore a magic set of drow chain , a cloak of resistance and ring of counterspells . In combat, she would wield a corrosive dagger and an enchanted shield . In addition, after the plundering of Szith Morcane , she managed to acquire a number of caches of Lolthite treasure that she stored in her room.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Velasta had a deep rivalry with her identical twin sister, Velina T'sarran, to the extent that both of them would happily engineer situations where the other could be "accidentally" killed off. This hatred was only exacerbated after the coup of Szith Morcane when Velasta acquired the larger share of the plunder.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As a female of House T'sarran, Velasta had been schooled as a cleric of Kiaransalee along with her identical twin sister, Velina. However, over the years, both sisters had developed an abiding hatred for each other. In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , during the Silence of Lolth , Velasta and her sister worked with the rest of their house in overthrowing the Lolth-worshiping drow of Maerimydra . Subsequently, they were sent to track down any refugees from the city under the supervision of their aunt, Dorina T'sarran, and made their way to the drow outpost of Szith Morcane . On Marpenoth 12 , they managed to overthrow House Morcane in Szith Morcane and, under the orders of Dorina, Velasta was given free rein to turn the dead clerics of Lolth into quth-maren and use them to pillage the settlement, while her sister Velina was sent into the Deep Wastes as a scout.</p>
<p>While her sister was assigned to the raiding parties by Dorina, Velasta was made part of a hunter-killer team of drow that was only assembled to deal with true threats to Szith Morcane.</p>
<p>At some point after Marpenoth 27 , a group of adventurers launched a raid on Szith Morcane, Velasta and Velina were defeated but subsequently raised as undead revenants .</p>
<p>Circa 1486 DR , Velasta sought vengeance against Archmage Solom Ned'razak , who had arranged the deaths of her and her sister. Velasta tried to profit off the fire giants ' invasion to take control of the outpost but undeath gave her was patience and she had no need to hurry.</p>
