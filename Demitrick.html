<h2>Relationships</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Demitrick and his wife owned and operated three small boats to fish Maer Dualdon in the 1350s DR. Their catches were good and were shipped as far away as Triboar and Leilon in the south.</p>
<p>But during the Battle of Icewind Dale , in the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR , Akar Kessell 's forces surrounded and seized Targos. Many inhabitants of the town hid and barricaded themselves within their homes, preferring to let time and the elements take the lives of the savage invaders. However, the Old Scout and a few others took up arms and actively fought Kessell's minions. He, along with three trusted comrades, carried out guerrilla strikes on Kessell's forces, targeting patrols and supply caravans. After three days of this, to find out who was responsible, Akar Kessell tortured several citizens of Targos, and then captured Pilot's mother to force the Old Scout to surrender himself. Once he had them, Kessell killed them both as an example of his tyrannical will, leaving Pilot orphaned.</p>
