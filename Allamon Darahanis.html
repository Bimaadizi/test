<p>Allamon Darahanis was a Cyricist cleric and a wizard member of the Zhentarim who operated in the town of Dragon Falls and in the the Vast region in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As a lowly priest of Cyric, Allamon had access to several simple spells of the divine nature, such as: cure minor wounds , detect magic , bane , protection from good , and shield of faith . However, as a mage, he was proficient in arcane spells from up to sixth circle of magic. Some of the more notable spells in his repertoire included Otiluke's freezing sphere , teleport , polymorph other , Evard's black tentacles , haste , dispel magic , hold person , and mage armor , among others. He also possessed the knowledge and skills of arcana and spellcraft that allowed him to empower, extend, and quicken spells.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Allamon was armed with a simple dagger and wore the unholy symbol of Cyric. He also carried a small enchanted item – a rusty gem , that when activated, summoned a rust monster under the gem-owner's command.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On the 17 th of Flamerule , the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Allamon Darahanis was tasked by his superior, Threll Whitebane of the Zhentarim, to recover the recently stolen artifact – a Book of Vile Darkness . At 7:28 AM on Flamerule 17, Allamon led a group of Zhents under the effects of the invisibility sphere spell to the home of Harris Redfire on the outskirts of Dragon Falls. Harris was a Mystran who created an inter-dimensional vault for storing evil artifacts securely out of the hands of malicious individuals and servants of dark gods. At 7:49 AM, Allamon used the passwall spell and attacked Redfire in his bedroom. By 7:52 AM, Allamon and his men subdued the Mystran mage, and with the use of the alter self spell, Allamon assumed Redfire's guise.</p>
<p>When a group of adventurers from the Living City arrived carrying the lockbox with the Banite Book of Vile Darkness , they were created by "Harris Redfire," who attempted to fool them into leaving the tome with him. From here, the accounts of the events varied. Some claimed that the heroes entrusted him the precious cargo only to realize their mistake and confront the Zhents in a cave, also rescuing the real Harris Redfire, while others swore that Allamon Darahanis was unable to fool the group, and a spell-battle broke out. One way or another, Allamon was subdued but refused to cooperate with the heroes any further.</p>
