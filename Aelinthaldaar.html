<p>Aelinthaldaar was the capital city of Illefarn , an ancient elven civilization in northwest Faerûn . The city was located where Waterdeep would later stand.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The city was founded circa −8500 DR and stood for some seven thousand years.</p>
<p>However, the elves destroyed their own city in −1100 DR when they retreated to Evermeet . The coronal of Illefarn ordered the whole city razed with elven high magic , leaving very little behind to indicate it had ever been there.</p>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>The elves of Aelinthaldaar created a magical effect, or mythal , known as the Melairshield , which prevented the plateau from collapsing, regardless of activities below the surface. It remained in effect into the 14 th century DR .</p>
<p>All that physically remained of Aelinthaldaar were crypts below the Pantheon Temple of the Seldarine in Waterdeep.</p>
