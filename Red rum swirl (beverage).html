<p>Red Rum Swirl was a pleasant comfort alcoholic beverage that was served in inns and taverns across the Realms during the 14 th century DR , such as the Hidden Lady .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Red Rum Swirl was a nutty, pleasant, and gentle softly colored red drink. Its hue was due to the sparing use of cherry brandy . The rest of the ingredients used in the mixed drink included a base of rum mixed with an abundant amount of almond brandy and stirred-in caramel , made out of cream and sugar.</p>
<p>The gentle sweetness of the drink made it easy to drink too much, oftentimes leaving imbibers extremely maudlin and intoxicated.</p>
