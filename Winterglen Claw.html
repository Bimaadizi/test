<p>The Winterglen Claw , sometimes called the Claw of Winterglen , was a group of human rebels and runaway slaves opposed to the ruling fey of Sarifal in the Moonshae Isles as of the late 15 th century DR . It was unclear whether the group referred to themselves as the "Winterglen Claw" or if the name had been bestowed on them by others.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Claw's main aspiration was to free the humans of Gwynneth , where the fey of Sarifal had taken over and enslaved the humans who had called it home. They had the boats and resources to travel to other islands as well if needed.</p>
<p>They were a secretive and shadowy faction, but were nevertheless the subject of rumors among the human realms of the Moonshae Isles: some envisioned them as mighty assassins and warriors , while others doubted their existence entirely. Within Sarifal, they were not taken seriously by the proud and immensely powerful ruling le Shay , and Sarifal's queen, the High Lady Ordalf , was known to capture and utterly subjugate members of the Claw to serve as her slaves.</p>
<p>Their leader was Captain Rurik , who was himself at least as famous among the humans of the Moonsahes as the Claw itself.</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>The Claw rode on great horses , such as the mighty Cambro draft horse . They had experience with hit-and-run attacks, and a favored tactic was to hide within a forest near Caer Corwell said to have been made dangerous by the Spellplague a century prior (which their fey and elven foes hesitated to enter). They traveled in small groups, and when they camped, they both set sentinels and avoided stripping the saddles and bridles from their steeds.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Claw worked alongside Lord Mindarion of the Llewyrr , who was one of many fey inhabitants of Sarifal who had begun to find le Shay rule to be intolerable. Through him, they were loosely aligned with the Knights of Synnoria , however they were unable to work well with other leaders of the Knights, such as Lord Askepel , who refused to acknowledge the humans as a necessary or equal ally.</p>
<p>They had common aims with an alliance of fomorians led by Ughoth , who hated the le Shay for having slighted and betrayed them in the past when they imprisoned a fomorian princess, Marabaldia .</p>
<p>When the Winterglen Claw came to the attention of the court of High King Derid Kendrick of Callidyrr , the king took a nominal interest in sponsoring the organization in exchange for their loyalty to him. While this was welcomed by the Claw, many members did not trust the king and considered him a coward.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 1470s DR, one of High King Derid's cousins, Lord Aldon Kendrick , made plans to travel to Sarifal aboard the Sphinx to offer vague promises of money and weapons to the rebels in exchange for an oath of loyalty to the king. In truth, his trip was coordinated by Aldon's rivals within the Kendrick family, who contacted High Lady Ordalf about his trip. When the Sphinx arrived at the ruins of Caer Corwell—where Lord Aldon had been told to expect to meet the Claw—they were met by the High Lady herself, pretending to be an agent of Captain Rurik. She personally killed Lord Aldon, and insisted to the crew of the Sphinx that the Winterglen Claw did not exist.</p>
<p>A tenday later, members of the Claw partnered with Mindarion to ride to Caer Corwell to rescue a lycanthrope named Poke from the le Shay, because she supposedly knew the location of a missing le Shay princess, Amaranth , whom Mindarion and his allies wished to elevate to the throne of Sarifal by overthrowing High Lady Ordalf. In addition to Poke, they rescued Suka , a member of the crew of the Sphinx , and Marabaldia, a long imprisoned fomorian princess.</p>
<p>After losing many men in an ambush by drow soldiers of the le Shay, the Claw made their way to the stronghold of Harrowfast to meet with forces of the Llewyrr and of the fomorians in hopes of forging an alliance to overthrow the le Shay. Despite having over ten thousand combined troops—sufficient strength to capture Karador , by Captain Rurik's estimate—the negotiations broke down. First, the elves insisted on installing Amaranth on the throne, whereas the Claw wished for no more le Shay rulers. Second, the arrogant elves refused to agree or acquiesce to any requests made by the humans or fomorians, including the Claw's demands for the freedom of all human slaves. Finally, an accidental confrontation saw Captain Rurik and Suka mistaken for escaped slaves, leading to them killing three Llewyrr guards, including the Marchlord Oemeril Talos–claere , and forcing the Claw to flee from Harrowfast before the Llewyrr could retaliate. Fighting then broke out between the elves and the fomorians as well. The collapse of the alliance was a major disappointment for the Claw.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The Claw's members were human rebels and former slaves of the fey. It included both Ffolk and Northlanders , who set aside their ancient grudges in the face of the fey threat. They naturally despised the fey of Sarifal, not only for enslaving them, but for the perceived arrogance and sloth that arose from their long lifespans.</p>
