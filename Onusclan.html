<p>The Onusclan was an orc clan that claimed the northern reaches of the Orsraun Mountains in the Vilhon Reach in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>Around 1370Â DR , the Onusclan was ruled by King Highstead . Under his competent leadership, the clan occasionally raided neighboring territories of the southern Ancient Ax goblin clan and the eastern Tattered Cloth kobolds . The orcs of Onusclan kept both neighboring kobolds and goblins in check and preoccupied, keeping them from growing or successfully waging wars against other enemies. However, whenever the Onusclan orcs trespassed in the Orbrekh , the territory of a group of giants calling themselves the community of the high brows that just wanted to be left alone, the giants decimated the orcs involved.</p>
