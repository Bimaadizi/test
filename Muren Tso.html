<p>The Muren Tso , or the River of the Sky , was a river in the Hordelands .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Fed by glaciers in the Katakoro Shan and A-Ling Shan mountain ranges, the Muren Tso river flowed across the Katakoro Plateau until it reached the Nor Yudol lake, continuing on as the Muren Khi .</p>
<p>The water of the river was clear and looked fresh, yet minerals from the mountains made the water bitter and mildly poisonous. Those who drank the water suffered from stomach cramps, nausea, and muscle pain.</p>
<p>The nomads of the steppe were known to "forget" to tell travelers of the river's properties.</p>
