<p>Gauthklaun Olaundran was the patriarch of the Olaundran merchant family in Delzimmer circa the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR . At that time, his health and strength were failing and the townsfolk referred to him as "Old Gauthklaun". For the most part, his two eldest sons, Yolaun and Bezrar , had tacitly taken over the reins of the family business, although Gauthklaun was not fully aware of it.</p>
