<p>The Voice of Telos was the mysterious political and religious leader of the Warlock Knights who ruled Vaasa in all but name in the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Voice was careful to make sure that no one was able to discern their appearance, race or gender. They were only seen while wearing long, plain robes, and only communicated via telepathy with their subjects in order to hide their voice.</p>
<p>In truth, the Voice of Telos was a male human of evil alignment who had lived to be unnaturally old.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Voice ruled the Warlock Knights as the leader and thirteenth member of the Ironfell Council , and all Warlock Knights bowed to his authority. Under the Voice's leadership, the Knights siphoned power from the comatose primordial Telos , and the Voice called for the Knights to heed the entity's unconscious thoughts and dreams.</p>
<p>The Voice also led the Luminaries , a sect of hand-chosen warlocks who served as the equivalent of priests of Telos.</p>
<p>Incurring the Voice's wrath—such as by slaying a Knight-Vindicator—might prompt a decree that the offender was to be killed on sight and then delivered to the Voice to be eternally encased in an ironfell coffin . Such a decree led to every Knight and shardsoul in Vaasa being made aware of the offender's identity and appearance.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Voice rose to power after being the first one to discover the primordial Telos lying in the crater created when it fell from the sky during the Spellplague . With the power gained from that encounter, the Voice founded and organized the Warlock Knights of Vaasa, and soon took control of the entire realm. As of the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR , the Voice was the eldest of the Warlock Knights and wielded power equivalent to that of a king. The only member of the Ironfell Council who openly questioned the Voice's authority was Mansard Kanaoth , although even he dared not do so in public.</p>
