<p>The Defiant Gesture was an inn located in the city of Zhentil Keep during the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The inn was located in south Zhentil Keep in the western section of the Foreign Quarter just off of Twilight Street .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Defiant Gesture stood three storys high and was well-maintained. A signboard depicting a human hand with thumb and pinky touching adorned the entrance. This was considered to be a rude gesture in Zhentil Keep.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The inn rented 24 rooms at a rate of 10 gp per night. Stables found behind the inn could be used for 5 gp per night. Baths were 1 gp, meals 4 gp, and a mug of pathetic ale was 4 sp . The steep prices reflected the difficulty in importing quality food into the city following its destruction in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>A retired Zhentilar warrior named Trevis Uhl ran the inn in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR . A trio of young serving girls worked at the inn as well.</p>
