<p>The Schooled was the name given to the students of the Magister Caldauvur Maerglauthyn . The Magister enforced ironclad discipline amongst his students through spells, but he accepted anyone into his classes; even his greatest detractors understood he meant to create a body of mages with conscience, strong ethics and a common understanding of principles. At least one of the communities of the Schooled lived in a manor within the lower Dessarin Valley . Caldauvur's slayer and the future Magister, Ildathchance Orlaer , visited some of them to further their knowledge of magic before his death.</p>
