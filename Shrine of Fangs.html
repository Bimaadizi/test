<p>The Shrine of Fangs was an ancient shrine to Merrshaulk found on the Snout of Omgar .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The entrance to the shrine resembled the open maw of a cobra , whose head had been carved into the side of a mountain. Two enormous fangs flanked the entryway, and its forked tongue formed 20‑foot-long (6.1‑meter) stone ramp that granted access within.</p>
<p>The cobra's mouth gave way to a 200‑foot-long (61‑meter) tunnel that spiraled down within the mountain. At the end was an ovular chamber that housed the temple proper. The walls of the Shrine of Fangs were frescoed with scenes of serpentine swarms, once adorned with numerous valuable gemstones . A sacrificial altar stood in the rear of the temple.</p>
