<p>Ruqiah was a member of the Desai tribe, part of the nomadic Bedine . She was the reincarnation of Catti-brie .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like her former incarnation but despite her parents' darker complexions, Ruqiah had thick, light brown hair with red highlights and blue eyes.</p>
<p>Ruqiah had two spellscars, one on each arm. On her left forearm was a seven-pointed star on a circle of red (the symbol of Mystra ); on her right forearm was a unicorn's head (the symbol of Mielikki ).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ruqiah was born in Anauroch on the spring equinox (19 Ches ) in 1463 DR to Niraj and Kavita . At age five, her blooming magic and secret garden caught the attention of the Netherese lord Parise Ulfbinder , who sent Shadovar agents Untharis and Alpirs De'Noutess to kidnap her. They failed and were killed by Ruqiah, who fled soon after to protect her parents, who practiced magic, from the Netherese .</p>
<p>In 1469 DR , Ruqiah was taken in by Lady Avelyere to be trained in the magic arts at her Coven in the Shade Enclave , where she remained for ten years until 1479 DR , when Lady Avelyere discovered her true identity. She then fled to Longsaddle, where she ceased using her name, preferring the alias Delly Curtie instead. In 1482 DR , she settled in Bremen in Icewind Dale . The following year, Spider Parrafin ( Regis ) joined her in Bremen, where they bided their time until the spring equinox of 1484 DR . At this time, they met up with Drizzt Do'Urden , saving his life from a mortal injury. It was at this time that Ruqiah returned to her original name of Catti-brie .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h3>Niraj and Kavita</h3>
<p>Ruqiah had a close relationship with her parents, Niraj and Kavita , who learned of her nature as Chosen of Mielikki in 1468 DR . Her father's nickname for her was "Zibrija," a type of flower that grew in the desert.</p>
<h3>Lady Avelyere</h3>
<p>Despite a rough start, Lady Avelyere viewed Ruqiah as one of her favorite students and gave her preferential treatment, allowing her to visit her parents once a tenday. However, she was not averse to using magic to pry information out of Ruqiah.</p>
