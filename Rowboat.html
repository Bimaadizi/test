<p>A rowboat was a type of small oar -powered vessel used to ferry passengers back and forth from larger vessels, or to navigate lakes and rivers. Similar in form and function to skiffs and punts , they were generally larger than canoes or coracles and smaller than launch boats and currachs .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Rowboats had no decks or typical crew, and were often carried by larger ships and deployed via davits . They required a minimum crew of one person, but operated best with two, and could carry a maximum of four people. Because of their small size and flat bottom they were generally unsuited to deeper waters, and were best suited for short journeys on calm waters such as rivers and lakes.</p>
