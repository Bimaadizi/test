<p>Jethaere was a Netherese enclave.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>To its inhabitants, or at least Evaereol Rathrane , Jethaere was a refuge for those who truly loved magic, rather than seek it for power. However, it had suffered great losses fighting the Phaerimm ; some of its mages fled rather than perish.</p>
<p>Jethaere wasn't amongst the cities whose remains were identified after the Fall of High Netheril.</p>
