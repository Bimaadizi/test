<p>Alaodin was an assassin and follower of Bhaal . He ran an assassins' guild from Sentinelspire until he was supplanted by Chereth . He was also Talieth 's father.</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>When Chereth disguised himself as Alaodin, he took on the appearance of an old man in a black, hooded robe. His face had a manly chin, his hair was thinning and gray, but with streaks of black, just up to his shoulders. He had the darker skin tone of a man from the southern regions, intensely wrinkled, but with bright and sharp eyes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Per his daughter, Talieth , early life for Alaodin was not easy: he was more often surviving than living. He eventually became, however, a man of wealth and power, and a follower of the god Bhaal. He took residence in a fortress hidden in the mountain of Sentinelspire , where, armed with divine inspiration, he created a garden where every pleasure was at hand for his followers, assassins he sent across the land and put in the service of the rich and powerful. He often sought as payment official sanction for the worship of Bhaal. During this time, Alaodin gathered a number of killers to himself, including an orphan from Elversult , Kheil , and a tribal half-orc , Sauk . After the death of Bhaal, he began looking feverishly for other sources of power, including relics, lore, and allies. All in all, there were about fifty followers of the Old Man by 1367 DR , including some wizards. Around 1363 DR , Chereth reached out to Alaodin through contacts in Glarondar , requesting an audience to study the Imaskari fortress of Sentinelspire. The Old Man of the Mountain granted him the request, presumably hoping that the druid would uncover something he could use, and he spent days and nights studying the relics in the fortress, until he came across Erael'len , which he stole, slaying several assassins while escaping. In retaliation, Alaodin sent his best assassins, including Kheil and Sauk , after Chereth and his allies in the Yuirwood on 1365 DR . The attempt on Chereth's life was unsuccessful.
By 1369 DR , Alaodin had put down two insurrections, as the death of his god in 1358 DR and Chereth's escape in 1363 DR had far reduced his standing. The second insurrection, led by his daughter Talieth , had led to the death of almost half of the Blades of the Old Man , and left the others far from fighting shape. That year, Chereth returned and slew Alaodin, impersonating him thereafter.</p>
