<p>Agaza the Dreamweaver , who was known as the Witch o' the Woods among the inhabitants of the town of Lonelywood , was a night hag who settled in the Lonelywood Forest and operated under the guise of a druid of Mielikki in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Agaza was a tall, haggard woman with glowing red eyes, dark, wrinkled hag skin, and rotting black teeth. In her maiden guise, Agaza appeared as a young, pretty, but unremarkable human woman. She wore a large black amulet around her neck, the hag's heartstone . Her smile had an odd and unnerving feel.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Agaza was a powerful night hag with all the powers and magics that her kind possessed. She could place curses on her victims and prepare potions and salves for her "customers."</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Agaza owned a collection of magic items, potions , and spells that she was willing to sell to her allies. In Lonelywood, the hag lived in a small shack deep in the forest. The shack's front door was kept locked by a collection of locks and deadbolts. Underneath the shack, Agaza built a basement for her dark rituals.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Agaza took residence within the Lonelywood Forest. She used a trustworthy disguise of the Witch of the Woods, a kindly druid, not to raise suspicion amongst the people of the town, as she put a curse of sleepless nights and nightmares on the folk of Lonelywood to drive them to become soul larva . To protect her hut, the hag unleashed fiends in the depths of the forest: black abishai , erinyes , kocrachons , and hell hounds , as well as cursts and doom knights , causing the locals to fear the strange sounds and not to wander into the woods. Agaza managed to afflict all inhabitants of Lonelywood and even lured the recently arrived Captain of the Grim Voyager into partaking in the witch's cursed ointments.</p>
<p>Soon after Agaza settled in the Lonely Wood, a hag coven settled in the nearby areas, brought over by the looming danger of the godling Arctus . The hags of The Sisters of Fury coven served Malar , Umberlee , and Auril , imposing on the Agaza's territory, and had to be destroyed. Just in time, the Hero of Neverwinter cleaved their way through the Lonelywood Forest to stop the nightmares and hoping to find the mysterious Masked Lady to regain their lost memories. The night hag offered the Hero a deal: The Sisters's heads in exchange for returning the Hero's memories, claiming that the heads were necessary for the said ritual. To convince the Hero, she agreed to lift the nightmares from the folk of Lonelywood and the Captain of the Grim Voyager . Convinced, the Hero of Neverwinter went on to behead Agaza's enemies: Dorotee Leachlung , Cylia Coldbreath , and Gertrude Wormtongue .</p>
<p>Once the Hero returned with the grim bounty, Agaza tossed the heads into a noxious cauldron and invited them to descend into the cellar. To no surprise, the hag lied and used the Sisters of Fury as sacrifices to perform a summoning ritual. In the cellar, a massive fiend stood in the hag's summoning circle â€“ Gorgomorz , Devil of Daggerford . The fiend was killed and banished from the Prime Material plane just a year prior by the hand of the Hero of Daggerford . Agaza made a pact with Gorgomorz to rule alongside him over Icewind Dale after Arctus was unleashed and laid waste to the region. The hag left the Hero of Neverwinter for Gorgomorz to rip apart. However, the Hero emerged victorious. Before they could land a killing bow, banishing the monster back into the lower planes , Gorgomorz pleaded not to strike him down. The fiend was unwilling to face the humiliation of being banished once again and offered the Hero a deal to help in the looming battle against Arctus and its armies. It was unknown if the Hero of Neverwinter accepted, but one way or another, they emerged from the cellar alive, to Agaza's disappointment.</p>
<p>The witch conceded that the Hero won and she was no fool to try and betray or try and kill them, seeing how they defeated Gorgomorz. Agaza could not return the Hero their memories but was able to tap into their recent memories, showing the Hero the Masked Lady and but a sliver of what was lost. She promised to release the people of Lonelywood and leave the Ten Towns. If the Hero decided to keep the witch alive, believing her promises, Agaza traded with them, offering a collection of magic items for sale.</p>
