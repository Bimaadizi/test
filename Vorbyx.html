<p>Vorbyx was said, by the orcs and ogres of Thar , to have been the "First King of Thar".</p>
<p>By 1373 DR no one remembered who Vorbyx was, or even what race Vorbyx was. What is known is that Vorbyx united the orc and ogre tribes of Thar. However, the time Vorbyx took to do this was longer than the life span of an ogre or orc, thus sages speculated about his "true race".</p>
<p>Vorbyx's Hammer was a legendary weapon believed to have been used by Vorbyx.</p>
