<p>King Toba was a plaguechanged giant snapping turtle that made its home in Snapping Turtle Bay on the southern coast of Chult during the late 15 th century DR . The name was bestowed on the beast by the local Chultans .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>King Toba was was said to be the size of a house and, indeed, the beast was unusually large and hearty for a giant snapping turtle. Energies from the Spellplague had caused parts of its shell to turn into gemstone -like crystals, which granted the turtle some resistance to spells and other magic . Upwards of sixty such crystals covered the shell, each of which was potentially quite attractive to treasure hunters (and valued at about 10 gp apiece).</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>King Toba spent its days sunning on the white sand beaches of Snapping Turtle Bay, at least whenever the sky was clear of smoke and ash from the nearby Peaks of Flame .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Naturally, rumors of this gem-studded turtle had reached all the way to Port Nyanzaru as of the late 15 th century DR.</p>
