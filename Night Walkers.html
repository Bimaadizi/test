<p>Night Walkers were a type of magic boots , associated by the followers of the god Shar .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These black boots appeared darker than the night's sky, while emitting no detectable dweomers.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Originally, these boots were very strongly enchanted , and allowed the wearer to move swiftly, without revealing their magical presence. They even allowed the wearer to step through a door of invisibility , several times per day.</p>
<p>Over time, their powers faded somewhat. By the 15 th century DR , Night Walkers made the wearer immune to becoming enwebbed, such as the effects of the web spell and natural webs produced by spiders . It also allowed them to teleport themself by stepping through dark mist .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These boots were originally created in honor of the Mistress of the Night, Shar.</p>
<p>One pair was worn by a Dark Justiciar , a member of the church of Shar that had gained admittance by killing a member of the Church of Selûne . Very self-assured, the Dark Justiciar was a among the Sharrans that raided Moonhaven in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , but died during the assault.</p>
