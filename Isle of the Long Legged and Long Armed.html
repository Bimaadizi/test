<p>The Isle of the Long Legged and Long Armed was a tiny island in the Outer Isles of Wa in Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The island was known for its very strange inhabitants. The race abiding there was composed of extremely tiny individuals, persons achieving a height of no more than an inch (a couple centimeters). Moreover, they all had (relatively) long legs (twice the length of their bodies ) and long arms that drooped all the way to the groundâ€”hence the name of the island.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The inhabitants of the island were known among mainland Wa as superb artists; their tiny paintings were prized and highly valued among the rich.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ionoi , an advisor to the daimyo of Kurahito , was a refugee from the Isle of the Long Legged and Long Armed, having been banished from his home for having legs that were too short.</p>
