<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ruvaen was one of the elves with which Prince Elminster Aumar remained with during his time as the priestess Elmara of Mystra , and swore aid to her if she ever came upon a way to defeat the Magelords of Athalantar . In Year of the Chosen, 240 DR , he had trouble recognizing Elminster as Elmara, which led to certain wariness until Baerithryn involved himself to prevent a standoff. He later was the first elf to question Prince Elminster Aumar how he planned to capture Athalgard .</p>
<p>Ruvaen later informed the Knights of Athalantar , a group that had since descended into banditry, of the presence of a scrying crystal near them that one of their own had been using, leading to the knight Anauviir slaying a fellow knight Halidar , who attempted to escape on the spot. He later heralded the prince to them, allowing a meeting between the two of them to proceed. Ruvaen would later form part of the elven support for the knights that would allow them to approach Athalgard unseen and untargetted by the Magelords.</p>
