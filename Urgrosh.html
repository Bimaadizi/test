<p>An urgrosh , also known as a spear-axe , was an exotic two-handed melee weapon.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Urgroshs were much like the dwarven waraxe , but with a longer haft. Longer even than a greataxe , but not so long as to be considered a pole arm . The gripping end of the haft was mounted with a spearhead.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>Because of their two heads, the urgrosh could deal either slashing or piercing damage. The urgrosh was considered a double weapon that could be used as if fighting with two separate weapons provided it was wielded two-handed. If used one-handed, it was treated as either a shortspear or a battleaxe .</p>
