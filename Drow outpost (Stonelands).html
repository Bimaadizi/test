<p>A drow outpost beneath the Stonelands was used as a base of House Avithoul in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The outpost was located somewhere beneath the Stonelands, under an ancient Netherese tomb and Daeronnax 's lair. It was on the upper edge of the Underdark as it merged with various surface-level cave systems. It was connected by a portal to the city of Sschindylryn , from which the drow forces originated. A group of lizardfolk lived nearby, with a distinctly unfriendly attitude to the drow.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the 1480s DR , the base was controlled by Mistress Laerion'vyr , a high priestess of Lolth . She commanded a sizable detachment of soldiers, wizards , priestesses , skeletons , and driders . A team of ritualists were led by the summoner Vur'din , who produced a great number of servile red , blue , and green slaadi , and the powerful gray slaad Il'tharis the Terrible . When the adventurer Popkin Shortshanks put out a call for assistance nearby, her allies may have discovered the outpost and attacked the drow.</p>
