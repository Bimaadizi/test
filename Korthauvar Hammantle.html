<p>Korthauvar Hammantle was a mage and scrier of middling power and authority within the ranks of the Zhentarim in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Korthauvar was privately outspoken, decisive, and somewhat emotional.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He was skilled and flexible when casting spells, especially ones of divination . Of note, he was able to use at least one spell or other process that allowed them to determine whether someone else had been through a gate they themselves had used before. Korthauvar, in particular, could use some spells through a farscrying.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Korthauvar was taller than Hlael.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Korthauvar and Hlael Toraunt were friendly enough to one another, and often bantered together. They did many castings together.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Hlael and Korthauvar had access to extensive resources for the purpose of scrying.</p>
<p>The two of them were wary of Hesperdan 's motives.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Korthauvar Hammantle had at some point walked through Tombgate , allowing him to use a spell to scry on portals he knew of.</p>
<p>At some point, Hlael Toraunt and Korthauvar Hammantle had discovered a stretch of passageway in their hideout that was proof against scrying of some form. While there, they badmouthed the Zhent policy of trying to steal Shandril Shessair 's spellfire , considering it too costly to send more than a few mages to their doom; unknown to them, they were being spied upon by their immediate superior, Drauthtar Inskirl , who, taking their advice, sent the two of them alone to steal Shandril Shessair's spellfire .</p>
<p>They resolved to work smarter, not harder, and to try and avoid actually going for Shandril as long as they could. To find her, they began by scrying for gates employed recently by Tessaril Winter , quickly ascertaining she had traveled along with two others through Tombgate. Reasoning those two others must've been Shandril Shessair, the spellfire wielder, and Narm Tamaraith , her husband, they decided those two were headed for Scornubel. Before committing to their findings, however, they scried on Tessaril herself, only to find her protected by her proximity to Azoun IV and the intense wardings that shielded him. They resorted to scrying on a highknight in Azoun's personal retinue instead, learning the two of them had been disguised as priestesses of Chauntea . For some reason, he was either expecting to ask Hesperdan or concerned that he knew where Tombgate led.</p>
<p>Once they locked in on the caravan, Korthauvar judged it too full of dangerous people to try and snatch the spellfire directly at the time, instead dithering through the first few ambushes. Though Hlael became unsettled, Drauthtar approved of their strategy and said as much while they waited. They were forced into action, however, as a spell materializing a cloud of blades converged on Shandril, and Korthauvar cast something through their farscrying to break that spell. Hlael then recast their farscrying. They continued to stall afterwards as the caravan reached Triel , after taking stock of the spellfire seekers still in the caravan. Though they feared Drauthtar's wrath, he informed them again he approved of their approach. Unknown to them, they were in turn farscried on by the Red Wizards under Hulrivior 's command.</p>
<p>They were sent into action directly by Hesperdan shortly after they scried on Marlel slaying Hulrivior in Triel during a meeting. They made their move just as the final ambush fell on the caravan, and converged on Sharantyr , who had just arrived. Korthauvar Hammantle was slain there by Narm Tamaraith.</p>
