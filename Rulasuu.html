<p>Rulasuu was an island and naval base located off the coast of southwest Halruaa .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The island of Rulasuu served as one of two major bases for Halruaa's navy. It housed normal sailing vessels as well as magical skyships .</p>
<p>A formal city or town did not exist on the island, so the sailors often took their shore leave in the nearby city of Khaerbaal , making it quite rowdy at times.</p>
