<h2>Geography</h2>

<h2>Government</h2>
<p>As of the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR , the king of the Thunderbeast tribe was Gundar Brontoskin .</p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>The homes in Grunwald were family halls, long and ovaloid mounds, said to resemble burial mounds overgrown with bushes and scrub. They were constructed of heaped stone, topped with timber roofs spread by mud, which often had grass and moss growing atop them. Some were known to have chimneys.</p>
<p>The stones of these houses were sourced from the above-ground ruins of the ancient dwarfhold, while their timber was harvested from the surrounding forest.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The primary product of Grunwald was timber from the Lurkwood, which was primarily traded in the wintertime with Mirabar and Longsaddle . Dark shanut wood was also a valuable commodity that was in demand in Waterdeep and Sundabar , often for the purposes of wood carving.</p>
<p>On an individual level, the inhabitants of Grunwald sold wares to any passing merchant regardless of whether or not they had anything to barter. These wares often included the pelts of polar bears , the furred skins of glacier snakes , as well as various forms of wood carvings that ranged from small statuettes and rings to life-size statues.</p>

<p>Grunwald had a standing patrol of twelve veteran barbarian warriors that were skilled in the use of slings , spears , and various sorts of blades. Their weapons were often laced with a sleep-inducing substance, known as haedrar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Grunwald was built upon the ruins of a dwarfhold, which was referred to by the dwarven name Thornhammer, though no one knew its true name.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Grunwald was the headquarters of the Thunderbeast tribe of Uthgardt barbarians. Compared to other Uthgardt tribes, the people of Grunwald were fairly welcoming to outsiders, though they did not appreciate loiterers. People who loitered for too long without any clear reason were often imprisoned, run out of town, or killed on the grounds that they could be a spy for orcs or rival tribes.</p>
<p>The resident priests of Tyr would often go out on patrols with the Thunderbeasts, guide wayward adventurers, and helped to maintain overall peace in the village. The resident druids of Silvanus would heal the townsfolk for no cost, though charged outsiders a steep fee.</p>
<h2>Religion</h2>
<p>Though the Uthgardt maintained their ancestral religion, over time they tolerated the presence of priests from other religions, primarily the druids of Silvanus and the clerics of Tyr. These groups had a grove and shrine respectively that were dedicated to their god, close to the king's lodge.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The inhabitants of Grunwald believed that anyone who willfully entered the tunnels beneath their village would awaken the spirits that dwelled within them and bring misfortune upon Grunwald.</p>
