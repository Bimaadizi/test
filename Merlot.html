<p>Merlot was a stray dog turned a guard dog from the Morden Winery outside the village of Dragon Falls in the Vast in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Merlot had a habit of eating grapes grown at the winery and because of that, it was named after a variety of wine from Cormyr .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Merlot and its fellow stray mutt Wander found their way to the Morden Winery sometime before the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR . The digs were fed and taken care of by the winery's inhabitants – medusa Samanthiss and her maedar mate – Vorlon . Eventually, the strays became loyal guard dogs for the couple and could often be found patrolling the winery, along with other creatures that defended it. Their keen sense of smell allowed for early intruder detection, and loud barking alerted the maedar and the medusa.</p>
