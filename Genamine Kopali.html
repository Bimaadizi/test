<p>Genamine Kopali was the Guild Kingpin of the Seatower district in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Genamine Kopali was an assassin by trade and she ran a similar group of ne'er-do-wells in the Seatower district. Her gang included a number of druids , who ensured the Guild's facilities were running and controlled a number of defensive beasts, such as shambling mounds , used to purify the Gate's water.</p>
<p>Mortlock Vanthampur personally sent Genamine coin in exchange for information of happenings in the sewers of Baldur's Gate .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the Guild faced a dangerous upstart crime lord, the Stone Lord , who was secretly allied with the Cult of the Absolute , the new kingpin gradually attacked and took over the Guild's territory. By the time the Absolute crisis of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR was raging in the Gate, Genamine Kopali and her Sewerkeepers were all slain and their headquarters was put to the torch . Genamine's body was not recovered according to the Guild's reports. Presumably, the Sewerkeepers were killed by the Stone Lord's men, however, it was also likely they were slaughtered by Orin the Red and her Bhaalists who used the sewers as their hunting ground.</p>
