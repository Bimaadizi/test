<p>Huntsilver was a noble house of Cormyr . An "old blood" family, it was considered one of the Royal Houses, owing to its close ties to the Obarskyr royal line.</p>
<h2>Base</h2>
<p>The family lived in Huntsilver Palace , situated beyond the Royal Gardens in Suzail .</p>
<p>They also had holdings in Dhedluk and Thunderstone .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the Silver family split, they formed the Huntsilver, Truesilver , and Crownsilver families. The Huntsilvers were established by 245 DR .</p>
<p>The Huntsilvers chose not to take sides when civil war erupted between Regent Salember and Prince Rhigaerd II in the Year of Daystars, 1268 DR . Instead, they equivocated when Salember demanded soldiers and aid.</p>
<p>In the event of King Azoun IV 's presumed death in the abraxus incident , the Huntsilvers were among those families who preferred replacing the monarchy with a ruling council, rather than a regency, in order to free Cormyr from what they saw as Obarskyr tyranny.</p>
<p>The fortunes of the Huntsilver family wavered for a while, when their sons died in wars with Sembia . Their daughters had been married to the Crownsilvers and Truesilvers , and were still awaiting heirs. Eventually, their fortunes must have shifted, for in the Year of the Nether Mountain Scrolls, 1486 DR , they were a strong enough force for Raedra Obarskyr to look to for acknowledgement of her ascension.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The Huntsilver family was seen as aloof in the mid–14 th century.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Huntsilvers were historically focused on managing Cormyr's forests and their resources. In the early years of the kingdom, the family organized the systematic development of forests for farmland. In the 14th century, Huntsilvers had a prominent role in clearing the Hullack Forest .</p>
<p>Members of the Huntsilver family rarely appeared at the Royal Court, except on important occasions or on issues regarding the forests of Cormyr.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>Like the other Silver families, the Truesilvers would often marry its members to the Obarskyrs and other Silvers, such as Crownsilvers and Truesilvers.</p>
