<p>The Yanitsava , or the Book of Teachings , was a holy book within the Red Mountain Sect of the Padhran religion . It held the teachings of the Enlightened One .</p>
<p>In 1359 DR , Second Empress Bayalun of the Tuigan quoted the above passage from the Yanitsava to the lama Koja of Khazari while discussing his faith.</p>
<p>In 1360 DR , Koja used a line from the Yanitsava — "Some men take the thread of their life and weave their own destiny." — to explain Yamun Khahan 's dreams of conquest and greatness to King Azoun IV . He explained the Red Mountain Sect believed such men were evil, as they forced their will on the world, rather than accept the will of the Enlightened One.</p>
<p>In the Yanitsava , it was said that all things had their balance. In 1362 DR , Koja used this to explain to Foxe that kumiss warmed the blood, despite the taste, and that Faerûnian roast meats unbalanced the weak and strong animus —meaning that Foxe was overweight.</p>
<p>In his book, A History of the Tuigan , Koja wished to quote a verse of the Yanitsava to invoke Furo 's blessing.</p>
