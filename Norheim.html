<p>Norheim was a Northlander kingdom within the Moonshae Isles that spanned the Norheim Isles .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Norheim was located in the northwestern region of the Moonshae Isles, with its isles forming the northern border of the Sea of Moonshae . The island and realm of Norland was located to Norheim's southwest, and the kingdom of Gnarhelm on northern Alaron was located to the southeast. The Korinn Archipelago was found due east of Norheim.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Norheim was ruled by six kings, the mightiest of whom nominally ruled over the other five from Hammerstaad on the largest island, Giantspine . The other major islands included Canthrell , Llorgh , and Graygruun . Another half-dozen unnamed islands were located within Norheim's boundaries as well.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>As of the midâ€“14 th century DR , the six kingdoms of Norheim could muster a combined force of 25 longships . Although few in number, these Norheimer crews consisted of fearsome fighters and berserkers . They were frequently engaged in raids against the Ffolk as well as realms across the Sea of Swords .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The ports of Norland were major stopovers in trade between the Northlanders of the Moonshaes and ports to the north, such as in Ruathym and Waterdeep . They exported slaves , treasure, and weapons captured in their raids against the Ffolk, and imported food and luxuries like oil , woven cloth , and liquor . Within its own territory, only the large island of Giantspine supported any notable agriculture or mining, and only the waters south of Canthrell were plentiful with fish.</p>
<p>The battle prowess of the Norheimers themselves meant they could often sell their services as mercenaries or sailors in the militaries of the Sword Coast .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to the conquest of the Norheim Isles by the Northlanders in the Year of the Animated Armor, 944 DR , they were inhabited by Ffolk and halflings . The Northlanders of Norheim would continue to wage war with the Ffolk of the south for centuries, and would continue raiding Ffolk lands long after that.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Saddle, 1345 DR , forces from Norheim led by King Raag Hammerstaad allied with Grunnarch the Red of Norland and Thelgaar Ironhand of Oman a war against the Ffolk kingdom of Corwell in what would come to be known as the Darkwalker War . This Northlander alliance would ultimately lose, and Raag would lose his life to the Pack . This was followed in the Year of the Bright Blade, 1347 DR , when the Northlanders signed a peace treaty with High King Tristan Kendrick of the Ffolk.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Norheim became part of the United Moonshae Isles under High Queen Alicia Kendrick with the signing of the Treaty of Oman , which virtually ended Northlander raiding of the Ffolk. However, this united kingdom would collapse by the late 15 th century DR after the Storm Maiden rallied the Northlanders to embrace their violent past and overthrow the weakened Kendrick kings.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The vast majority of land on Norheim's islands consisted of rocky and barren terrain, forcing the Northlanders to rely heavily upon the outside world for their survival, whether through trade or through raiding. The people of Norheim were a seafaring breed as a whole, though a minority did grow barley and wheat or tended sheep and goats . Raids from Norheimers into the lands of the Ffolk brought back just as much food as they did treasure.</p>
<p>Although the Norheimers were poor, their hospitality centered around feasting and dancing. Outsiders viewed them as a smelly and uncouth people, even compared to other Northlanders.</p>
<p>The Norheimers acknowledged several gods , most notably Auril , Tempus , Umberlee , and Valkur .</p>
