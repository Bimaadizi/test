<p>Psychic energy , also known as psionic energy , mental energy , or physio-mental energy , was a mysterious form of energy associated with the mind that was manipulated and shaped by certain monsters and races, as well as some individuals, through the sheer force of their will to alter reality in small to significant ways, producing effects that were collectively known as psionic powers .</p>
<h2>Sources</h2>
<p>Likely one of the most rigorously debated topics within the sphere of psionics study was the origin of psionic energy and what – or who – linked it to psionics users. For much of history it was distinguished from magical energies as being an internal energy , a natural force that living creatures harnessed from within their bodies by means of certain neural pathways, essentially making them their own Weave .</p>
<p>All sentient creatures exhibited mental energy within. Beyond the body of a creature, psychic energy could also be found within earth nodes and the dreams of living creatures. Additionally, plants , non-sentient plant creatures , and inanimate objects exhibited latent psionic energy.</p>
<p>The collective amount of psionic energy within an individual was referred to as either their pool, reserve, or reservoir. The areas of the body where this energy dwelt or welled up when using psionic powers were known as power points. Human bodies had five in total, plus a sixth center, the primary source of psychic energy. Known as the muladhara , this power point laid at the base of the spine. Additionally, a hidden reserve of psychic energy was dormant within the subconscious.</p>
<p>Among the various power points, the brain was the easiest spot for beginners to gather up energy. As a budding psionics user practiced, they learned how to move the energy around to different parts of their body. The notion of "gathering" or "drawing" psionic energy towards a power point was key to the process of using psionic powers, as this energy could not be forced or pushed. Some described the feeling of accumulating psionic energy at these points as being like a "warm spot", experiencing an instantaneous increase in apparent temperature there, accompanied by a "beat" sensation – as if the power point had fired the energy outward, throughout the user's body, in a radial pattern.</p>
<p>In order to restore a pool of its drained psychic energy, a creature needed to clear their mind by resting for a period of at least eight hours. While a psionics user could sleep during this time, sleep was not a requirement to restore psychic energy, though some found it to speed up the process. One simply had to refrain from physically or mentally demanding tasks, preferably in a peaceful environment. Once fully rested, all a psionics user had to do was undergo an act of concentration, such as a brief meditation, to finish the process.</p>
<h3>Theories</h3>
<p>By the late 14 th to early 15 th century DR , a much wider array of unifying theories for psionic energy developed on Toril that proffered the origins of the energy, as well as rises in the population of psionics users, could in fact stem from an extraneous source.</p>
<h2>Properties</h2>
<p>This energy could be taken from a creature, such as with the powers ego whip , psychic drain , and psychic vampire , with specialized crystals known as reverse capacitors , by certain cursed psionic items , and through the abilities of certain creatures. Conversely, a psionics users could share their pool of psychic energy with others, either with bestow power or a psionic seal if both individuals possessed one.</p>
<p>A significant loss or repeated draining of one's mental energy reserve carried the risk of severely damaging a creature's brain, potentially causing amnesia or even death.</p>
<p>There were a variety of objects designed to store psionic energy for later usage, either to augment one's powers or to continue manifesting powers after one's daily supply of energy had run dry, chief among them a specialized crystal called a crystal capacitor and psychic reservoirs . An object, most typically a gem , could also be made into a storage for psionic energy by using the power receptacle . And iomic crystals had a peculiar structure that made them well-suited for holding and releasing psionic energy.</p>
<p>Energy steeped in artifacts or locations would decay overtime from neglect. At sites where potent psionics-users had died Over the course of centuries, the energy in these abandoned or lost places and objects, as well as at sites where potent psionics-users had died, would warp and create areas of unstable mental energy known as wild psionic zones .</p>
<p>A residue of psychic or emotional energy was often left behind in sites of intense events, such as battles, betrayals, marriages, murders, and childbirths. Everday occurences left no such residue. The power sensitivity to psychic impressions allowed a psionics user to detect this residue and receive visions of the past event(s) that left it behind. Similarly, creatures left psychic impressions behind on inanimate objects they held ownership of for some time, which could be viewed by a psionics user with the object reading power.</p>
<p>Psychic energy could potentially warp a creature's physical development if they received a continued or excessive bombardment, such as transforming them into phrenic creatures . This was the case with a number of sea creatures that dwelt in the Vilhon Reach , having been altered by energy leaking from Jhaamdathan artifacts, and was the means by which mind flayers created cranium rats . The regenerative abilities of trolls notably had an unusual reaction to psychic energy, resulting in the creation of spirit trolls .</p>
<h3>Magic</h3>
<p>For much of history, psionic energy was distinguished from the external magical energies utilized in arcane magic and divine magic as completely separate forces, incapable of interacting with one another, but which could be used to achieve similar effects. Psionic energy could be used to mimic spells and magical abilities, and magical energies could be used in magic items and spells to mimic psionic powers.</p>
<p>Following the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the results of psionic powers became magical in nature. Psionics and conventional magic were fully transparent to one another, interacting just as magic did with itself, though not all spellcasters were aware if this was possible. In time there came to be spells that wielded psychic energy offensively, such as bedeviling burst , mind sliver , and synaptic static .</p>
<h2>Energy Sub-Types</h2>
<h2>Notable Manifestations</h2>
<h2>Notable Wielders</h2>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<p>The primary application of mental energy was the manifestation of psionic powers. Whenever a psionics user or wild talent used such powers, they projected the energy out of their body. For instance, when a mind flayer used mind blast they sent out a blast of mental energy. Psionic energy could come and go the instant a power was manifested, be used to sustain a timed duration, or remain as long as a power's effect was active. To varying degrees, using psionic energy in this manner could be straining on a creature's body. Other and more specific usages for psionic energy were as follows:</p>
<h3>Food</h3>
<p>Across the Realms and the wider multiverse there existed psionovores , creatures that derived sustenance from the mental energy of others.</p>
<p>Beyond those who fed on psychic or mental energy, there were some creatures that fed specifically on emotional energy. This included al-jahar , energons , feyr , harrlas, and ustilagors . Some were sustained upon only specific emotions. Alluras fed upon the emotions created by excitement, fear, and tension; Lichlings fed solely upon fear; skriaxits fed upon the fear and terror they instigated; simpathetics fed upon positive emotional energies; and will-o'-wisps fed upon negative emotions, particularly the powerful emotions associated with fear, panic, and death. Great feyr specifically craved strong or intense emotions. They were willing to travel great distances, lured by such emotions, and would inspire it in other creatures.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the catastrophe known as the Spellplague , Toril experienced a greater influx of psionic energy and over the nine-decades that followed the planet experienced a dramatic rise in the number of psionics users, including ardents and battleminds. Some scholars speculated this rise correlated to the substantial changes in Toril's magic that were wrought by the event, whilst others postulated that it originated from the return of Abeir . However, this theory was hotly contested, as Abeir did seem any more conducive to the practice of psionics than Toril was before its return, being far more steeped in the use of elemental magic . A third groupm, made up of a few savants scattered across libraries and hermit towers, bandied the Defenders of Reality theorum, explaining that it was the world's collective unconscious reacting to the rising influence of the Far Realm.</p>
<p>During the late 15 th century DR, the Red Wizards of Thay experimented with controlling energons, and trained them to transform their enemies' emotions into an energy source. Also around this time, a mind flayer colony established itself in the Seadeeps layer of Undermountain . This colony constructed a magical device, called the psionic force generator , which they powered by pouring mental energy into its crystal.</p>
