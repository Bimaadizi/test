<p>The Purged Palate was a dwarven cookbook periodical sold in the Western Heartlands in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>Each issue of The Purged Palate was a collection of recipes and the author's anecdotes about the said dishes. The Midwinter Edition of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR included the recipe for eaglach stew, a traditional dwarven with a unique twist from the author. Its name, when translated, could sound terrifying for non-dwarves, and The Purged Palate's version came seasoned with drider venom , added in after the stew's alcohol is completely cooked out. However, the author advised the readers not to use drider venom and instead just add other sour and non-deadly ingredients. The anecdote that accompanied eaglach came from the time the author worked as a city watchman. His dinner bowl was poisoned by a drow thief , which resulted in a delicious dish rather than death.</p>
