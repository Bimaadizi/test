<p>Mount Drakkor Rouge was a semi-extinct, partially flooded volcano in the southern Thunder Peaks , in an area later known as the Vale of the Dragon Oracle .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>On the side of this mountain was a crater-like depression filled with a salt marsh, covered in scum and rancid in smell, with a rocky landmass in the center that acted as an island. The outer shores of this island were steep and cliff-like. Much of this crater was obscured by mist throughout, though the sharply triangular tip of its island could be seen above the mists. Below the mist, temperatures within the crater were about 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius).</p>
<p>The way down into the crater was a steep-walled pass. The last 2,000 feet (610 meters) of this trail were along a high cliff, overlooking the crater's salt marsh, which ended at a wooden bridge. This spanned thousands of feet across the marsh, ending at its central rocky landmass. From there was a paved path leading up to a temple. Beneath that temple was a series of large, connected lava caves.</p>
<p>Water seeping down the mountainside filled the crater's lake and its only means of escape was evaporation. This marsh lake was roughly 50 feet (15 meters) deep and geothermal activity on the mountain kept it at about 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius).</p>
<p>From the village of Volkumburgh , there was a trail leading south up to Mount Drakkor Rouge.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>Most creatures that lived within the salt marsh were not native, such as giant leeches and giant scorpions , while some were artificially created, like the gargoyles and swamp sharks .</p>
<p>The island within the center of the salt marsh had its shallow shores lined with reeds and cypress -like trees.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the 10 th century DR , members of the Cult of the Dragon came to the Thunder Peaks area. While there, they built a wooden bridge across Mount Drakor Rouge's crater and carved out what would become the Temple of the Dragon Oracle on its central rocky landmass. They then filled its salt marsh with a variety of creatures in order to protect the temple. Witches among this cell of Dragon Cultists believed that the sulfurous vapors within the crater's lava caves would help them to prophesize the future.</p>
<p>Some time between the Year of the Molten Man, 1151 DR and the Year of the Agate Hammer, 1174 DR , some evil force overran the temple and forced its Dragon Cultists to abandon it. The gargoyles they'd introduced to the area continued to live in Mount Drakkor Rouge, turning the abandoned temple into their lair.</p>
<p>In Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , an adult red dragon by the name of Flashfire settled within the abandoned Temple of the Dragon Oracle and subjugated its gargoyle inhabitants. Once every month, the villagers of Volkumburgh had to bring five sheep to Mount Drakkor Rouge as tribute to Flashfire.</p>
