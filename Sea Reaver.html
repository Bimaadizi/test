<p>The Sea Reaver was a variety of enchanted scythe that originated from the artifact once wielded by Igulik , a legendary Rashemaar hero long before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>There existed three variants of the Sea Reavers ; each possessed a +1 , +2 , or +8 enchantment that made the scythe's blade deadlier and guided the wielder's hand towards the target. All three versions were ensorcelled to protect the wielder from elemental damage, but stronger variants had a deadly keen edge, and dealt additional and deadly sonic damage to elementals .</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>A Sea Reaver could be created from an enchanted scythe and a slab of adamantite .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first Sea Reaver was a legendary weapon from Rashemen . The mighty hero Igulik received the weapon from a great water spirit of Lake Ashane to use it against an evil wizard that sought to enslave the tribes through the power of summoned elementals. As was traditional for Rashemaar legends, Igulik was successful in saving his people but died heroically after ending the wizard's life. When Igulik died, the Sea Reaver returned to the great spirit of Lake Ashane to be one day given to another hero.</p>
<p>More common versions of Sea Reavers with a simpler +1 enchantment were forged by Master Blacksmith Marrok of the Shining Knight Arms and Armor shop of Neverwinter to help the heroes who sought the cure for the dreaded Wailing Death of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Later the same year, more powerful versions were created by Master Blacksmith Barun of Beorunna's Well to help the forces of Neverwinter stand against Lady Aribeth the Betrayer , who led a marching army of Luskan in the deadly but short-lived Neverwinter–Luskan war.</p>
