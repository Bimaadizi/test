<p>Stag was a thuggish bandit who operated in and around Yhaunn in 1373 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was an aggressive and unpleasant man, and wielded a short sword in combat. He was much more talkative than his companion Drik .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Stag was a close associate of Drik, and took the leader role of the pair. He was also on good terms with the other disreputable patrons of Cutter's Dip , such as Noyle , Kor , and Lahumbra Sashtyn . He was fond of calling Feena 'red bird' while menacing her.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Eleasis of 1373 DR , he and Drik attempted to waylay Feena Archwood outside of Yhaunn, not knowing she was a werewolf and a priestess of Sel√ªne . She defeated the two of them handily with her unarmed skills and divine magic , and left them unconscious outside the city.</p>
<p>A tenday later, Stag and Drik came across Feena again by chance at the Cutter's Dip tavern. This time, they turned the bar patrons against her by claiming she was a manipulative robber and a wild mage , and easily had her at their mercy as they tormented her with a cruel game of Dip's Stagger . This was interrupted by Keph Thingoleir , who rescued Feena purely out of personal disdain for Stag, and during a brief unarmed brawl Feena crushed his groin with her knee, leaving him incapacitated on the floor.</p>
