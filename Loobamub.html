<p>Loobamub was a myconid and leader of the Circle of Hunters in Neverlight Grove in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When, circa 1486 DR , Zuggtmoy 's will twisted most of the Grove, Loobamub and the Circle resisted the evil influence. Thanks to the cooperation of a party of adventurers escaping from drow slavers of Velkynvelve , the myconid leader Basidia led Loobamub, Rasharoo , and their followers out of the Grove before it was too late</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>A loyal follower of Basidia, Loobamub shared its leader's concerns about the strange behavior of Phylo and its followers. Loobamub kept its opinions to itself, but its wariness spread to the other hunters when they melded, cementing their loyalty to Basidia. Loobamub's main concern was redirecting the spore servants and awakened zurkhwoods Phylo created away from its circle's territory.</p>
