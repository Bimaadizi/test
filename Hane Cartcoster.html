<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Kythorn of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , her son Jarull voluntarily joined the cult of Shar in Yhaunn in search of new experiences, only to be kidnapped and taken prisoner by the Thultantharan shade Variance Amatick , who stole his identity and it to manipulate his friend Keph Thingoleir into joining the cult as well.</p>
<p>With her son missing, Hane had the city guard arrest and interrogate Keph, believing he knew what had happened, to no result. She also contacted the famous wizard Strasus Thingoleir and had him attempt to magically divine Jarull's location, also to no effect.</p>
