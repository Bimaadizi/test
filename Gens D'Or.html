<p>Gens D'Or , or the so-called the golden horses of the gods, were mounts from the Blade Kingdoms in the Vilhon Reach .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gens D'Or were creatures of magnificence, often coated in polished shining armor, giants among other horses. They had hard and deadly metallic hooves and hides of silver , gold or bronze . Each metallic hair on the Gens D'Or's hide majestically glistened in the sun with the creatures' every move. When adorned in full armor, they resembled giant animated statues.</p>
<p>Gens D'Or's beauty was matched by their riders, the Blade Captains of the Blade Kingdoms, who were adorned in the similarly magnificent glistening and intimately decorated armor and ostrich -plumed helmets.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of the Falling Moon, 1217 DR , Gens D'Or were used in annual bloodless "white wars" between the region's six city-states, as well as the short but bloody Blade Wars that started in the fall of 1217 DR, blossomed during the 11-Day Civil War , and lasted until the spring Year of the Swimming Cats, 1218 DR . Some of the Gens D'Or during that time included Prince-Elect of Sumbria – Cappa Mannicci 's majestic burnt bronze steed, golden mount of Blade Captain Orlando Toporello of Sumbria, and silver Gens D'Or ridden by Blade Captains of Ugo Svarézi of Colletro .</p>
