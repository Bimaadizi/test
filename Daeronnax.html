<p>Daeronnax was an ancient red dragon who lorded over the Clan Daeronnax kobolds in the Stonelands during the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Daeronnax was a massive red wyrm who felt nothing but disdain for humanoids and adventurers, using their bodies to decorate the entrance to his lair. He experienced no fear of heroes, only disgust.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Daeronnax laired in a volcanic magma-filled cavern beneath the Stonelands, surrounded by his Clan Daeronnax minions. Above his lair was an ancient Netherese tomb close to the surface, and deeper below in the Underdark was a drow outpost connected by portal to Sschindylryn .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The great red dragon kept an impressive hoard of treasure in a non-molten corner of his lair, which included many relics stolen from the nearby Netherese tomb. Some of the items found included heartwood and festering mummy wrappings .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 1480s DR , a band of adventurers made up of Popkin Shortshanks , Jarus Brithandir , Helayna , Tristran of Daggerford , Kirina Aelorothi , and Liantor Stoneborn discovered an ancient tomb at the bottom of a crevasse in the Stonelands. They fought through some undead and found the deeper tunnels below it, eventually earning the attention of the Clan Daeronnax kobolds who launched an attack that scattered the interlopers. Jarus, Helayna, and Kirina were separated and lost in the caverns, Liantor was caught and killed by the kobolds, and Popkin escaped to the surface to get help. The unlucky Tristran was caught and taken alive, then delivered to Daeronnax who kept him chained up in the treasure pile as a snack for later.</p>
<p>The adventurers that Popkin recruited proved more than able, and they were able to fight their way through the Netherese tomb and into the Clan Daeronnax tunnels, rescuing her companions as they went. They finally found the lair where Tristran was kept, and overcame the threat of the massive red dragon to rescue him. The remaining kobolds were heartbroken and terrified, and Daeronnax's hoard was rummaged through before the dragon-slayers departed, possibly with one of his empowered dragonscales .</p>
