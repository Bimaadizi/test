<p>Gideos was the mind flayer leader of the Bloodrovers , a pirate group that operated in Avernus in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gideos wore an eye patch over its left eye, which concealed a gem that, when exposed, amplified its telepathic capabilities.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Bloodrovers, led by Gideos, roamed the blasted wasteland of Avernus in a fleet of infernal war machines in search for treasure and soul coins . The pirate band included orcs , goblins , kobolds , and other humanoids .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Gideos witnessed the pulling of Elturel into Avernus. Seeing the event as an opportunity, it commanded the Bloodrovers to sabotage the machines that operated the chains that were pulling the city down, in an attempt to steal the stash of soul coins that fueled them.</p>
<p>During the attack, the pirates inadvertently captured Minsc and Nerys . As they attempted to escape and fend off the counterattacking demons , Minsc, Nerys, and the infernal war machine that had captured them fell into the Styx . The pirates rescued them, but Minsc completely lost his memory as a result of being exposed to the river's waters.</p>
<p>After the rescue, Gideos commanded the Bloodrovers to enter the fortress that housed one of the chains binding Elturel. With help from Nerys and a confused Minsc, the group successfully sabotaged four of the eight chains that held the city and collected a substantial amount of soul coins . Gideos regarded the heist as the greatest in Hells' history.</p>
