<p>Kar'r'rga was a savage god worshiped by the non-Enlightened natives of Jazayir al-Sartan in Zakhara 's Crowded Sea â€” human and non-human alike.</p>
<p>Its special servants, also called its children, were the monstrous sartani , which appeared just like their god: a giant humanoid with the head of a crab.</p>
<p>The lagoon called Batihat al-Saji in the center of the island group was sacred to Kar'r'rga. Here offerings were placed by his followers, while trespassing non-believers were said to be destroyed. The truth of the matter was that at the bottom of the lagoon a vortex could open to Pandemonium , where the crab god resided.</p>
