<p>In the Year of the Frozen Kingdoms, 1052 DR , High King Bayle Carrathal of the Moonshae Isles sent a small fleet to Jannath's Tears with the intent to annex the islands into his kingdom. His forces were sunk by the navy of Baldur's Gate, who came to the Tears' defense. Following this embarrassment, Bayle was deposed later that same year and replaced by Yolanda Carrathal , grandniece of his father.</p>
