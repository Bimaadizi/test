<p>Kegsplitter was a simple worn-looking enchanted axe created to slay ale kegs and by an extension of its powers – the occasional construct .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Kegsplitter was slightly bigger and slower than the average one-handed axe . The weapon's haft was etched with minor wounding and ever-sharp +1 enchantments . These enchantments made Kegsplitter effectively a +2 enchanted weapon when wielded against kegs or constructs. However, splitting goblins with it was just as easy.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kegsplitter originated in the small logging village of Shaengarne Ford in Icewind Dale , created sometime before the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR . Despite its fearsome yet somewhat underwhelming appearance, Kegsplitter saw little battle and was mainly used to split kegs, chop wood, and fell trees. At one point before Mirtul of 1312 DR, Kegsplitter was traded to the Gallaway Trade Depot in exchange for food and supplies for Shaengarne Ford to survive on for the following season. The axe ended up being available for purchase from Deirdre Gallaway in her trading company's store in Targos .</p>
