<p>Nora was one of the curious intelligent wombats who could speak, like an awakened animal, who lived on an island off the coast of Orlil , Lantan , in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like other wombats (and an occasional platypus ) of the island she lived on, Nora was effectively an awakened creature. She was a younger sister of Byrt , a wombat friend of Artus Cimber . Nora was described by her brother as rather large and mean.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1362 DR , shortly after Artus Cimber was thrown into the lair of a Batiri "god" in Chult , he met wombats Byrt and Lugg . The trio faced Grumog , a giant lizard-centipede monstrosity that the goblins were worshiping. Byrt compared the creature to his dear kid sister Nora.</p>
