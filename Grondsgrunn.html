<p>Grondsgrunn was a region of the island of Norland within the Moonshae Isles that was controlled by giants as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Grondsgrunn was found in the southern region of Norland where the South Jotunhammer Mountains were located. As of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the giant-controlled territory ended at the pass that separated the South Jotunhammer Mountains from the North Jotunhammer Mountains .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the midâ€“14 th century DR, this region had been controlled by the Northlander realm of Norland , however Grondsgrunn came into being when giants, most notably firbolgs , claimed the area as a colony. By the late 15 th century DR, the giants had become firmly entrenched, and had thwarted several attempts by the Northlanders to dislodge them. At this time, a volcano within the realm was threatening to erupt, and anxieties about this threat risked driving the giants northward into increasing conflict with the Northlanders. The combined forces of the Northlanders and the Ffolk of Norland were able to successfully repel the increasingly common giant incursions into their lands.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the Storm Maiden of Norland sought to rally the Northlanders to purge the giants from the island, and had successfully forayed into the South Jotunhammer Mountains and slain some Grondsgrunn patrols to prove her ability to lead such a conquest.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>As of 1479 DR, the largest band of firbolgs was led by the crone Lallargh , who had sought to unite the giants and forge alliances with duergar and other evil mercenary forces to lay siege to Rogarsheim .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, several coastal Northlander settlements fell within Grondsgrunn's sphere of influence, including Sordal , Sommersdal , and Follebu .</p>
