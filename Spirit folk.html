<p>Spirit folk were mystical descendants of humans and natural spirits . Though uncommon throughout Faerûn , they were most likely to be found in Rashemen and Kara-Tur . They were generally loving and peaceful creatures, in tune with the natural world around them.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Spirit folk resembled humans, but with more delicate features. They had smooth, hairless skin, except on the top of their heads and their thin eyebrows.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>Spirit folk got along well with most races. They were friendly and noninvasive.</p>
<h3>Humans</h3>
<p>Spirit folk usually blended in with human societies. They lived their lives as normal humans would, but were usually considered particularly wise or spiritually inclined by their peers. Humans who lived around spirit folk usually assumed they were simply eccentric humans, rather than a separate species. In Kara-Tur, spirit folk enjoyed legal privileges, such as being permitted to own land, that were restricted to humans.</p>
<h3>Elves</h3>
<p>Although rarely integrating with elven society, spirit folk generally got on well with elves.</p>
<h2>Subraces</h2>

<p>Bamboo spirit folk could move in forests without creating a trail, understood the languages of forest animals, and could magically hide themselves in forests. They were also resistant to magic involving earth or wood, including magic items made of wood. Their lives were tied to certain sacred groves, and they could be injured if their groves were damaged.</p>
<h3>Mountain Spirit Folk</h3>
<p>These mountain-dwellers were physically similar to other spirit folk. Mountain spirit folk could see in the dark twice as far as the average human, and they had the ability to speak with animals.</p>
