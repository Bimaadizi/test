<p>Brother Tobias Winery was a locally favored winery in the city of Westgate on the Dragon Coast , on the crossing of Westgate Market Street and Brewhouse Lane .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Brother Tobias Winery was a small multi-storied stone monastery-like building surrounded by a small public park with a small stream and a bridge. Underneath the winery was a wine cellar that extended into catacombs.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to the winery's owner, it was, indeed, once a monastery, until its monks slaughtered each other over some disagreement. Subsequently, the monastery was purchased by Tobias Timble , who turned it into a winery, keeping its monastic theme.</p>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR , Brother Tobias' wines were a staple in many of Westgate's inns and drinking establishments, including Black Eye Tavern and Bent Mermaid Inn . Brother Tobias' 1368 vintage was considered an especially good year, making these bottles popular due to their quality and cheap price.</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Brother Tobias Winery was closed to visitors due to renovations. However, that was just a cover story. The business owner, Tobias Timble, employed the monastery's old monks, who were turned into vampire spawn slaves, and the winery was run by the Night Masks , who accessed it via catacombs that led to Orbakh 's underground sanctum.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>After the monks were gone and the building changed owners, the winery's employees wore monk robes to keep with the theme.</p>
