<p>The Skymbles was the forgotten neighborhood of Ravens Bluff , hidden away in the eastern part of the city's Uptown District . It was home to the many Ravenian laborers, those citizens who were too reputable to live in poverty but who were nonetheless expected to toil their lives away at work. The streets of The Skymbles were lined with tiny homes, row-houses, and clusters of apartments with laundry lines seemingly hanging from nearly each building.</p>
<p>The drudgery of life in this neighborhood was interrupted every so often by grand street festivals, into which its citizens threw their enthusiasm with near-reckless abandon.</p>
