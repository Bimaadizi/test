<p>Mreyelundar was a port city and a member of the confederation of the Dusk Ports in Laerakond . It was the most decadent of all the Dusk Ports.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mreyelundar was known for its wealth, decadence, lawlessness, and illicit practices. Gangs dominated the city and gained great wealth after having paid the green dragon Orlarrakh her due.</p>
<p>The free people of Mreyelundar loathed dragons , having suffered first hand the depredations of the Green Duchess. In desperation, most of them turned to the cults of the Dawn Titans for succor. The Order of the Dawn , founded some years before 1479 DR , gained enough influence to be considered a real force behind Mreyelundar's closed doors.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Mreyelundar was ruled by a Gate Lord. In 1479 DR, the Gate Lord was Trusk Rantyne . However, he had no real power in the city, who was truly ruled by a mysterious thief known as Narnorn .</p>
<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>The foremost goldsmiths and gemcutters in all of Laerakond lived and worked in Mreyelundar.</p>
