<p>Cornelius Latrimor was one of the Magistrates of Cormyr , who performed work in the town of Wheloon in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Cornelius worked at the Wheloon Docks alongside Magistrates Abella Toth , Barthold Moncrief , and Celia Pendrick as they oversaw the operations of the prison and investigated criminals.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Shadovar invasion of Wheloon , Cornelius was charged with the interrogation of Sharran cultist Dedryk Black after he was captured by adventurers from the world of Eberron and taken back to Wheloon. Having been unsuccessful in learning anything, he let the adventurers who had caught him twice take a turn. Though he spoke mostly threats and curses, Dedryk did mention that he had passed through the shadows themselves to freedom, and was willing to entertain a small measure of cooperation to ensure the safety of himself and his followers. Before the interrogation could proceed much further, however, the whole area was assaulted by the forces of Returned Netheril as they overlapped the docks with the Shadowfell itself, allowing a small army of living shadows and enraged prisoners to burst into the Cormyrean position from the inside. While the defenders fought off the attack, the shadar-kai assassin Teralyn shadowstepped into the Magistrates office, slew Cornelius, and sent Dedryk back into the shadows to freedom. Before Teralyn could escape herself, she was cornered by the vengeful heroes from Eberron and slain in battle.</p>
