<p>Azmaer Dhuurniv was the last drow marshal of the Twisted Tower of Ashaba in Shadowdale in the early 10 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Azmaer oversaw the last retreat of the drow in the face of a human uprising in the Year of the Plough, 906 DR , and held the citadel against a year-long siege.</p>
<p>Though thought dead or exiled or hiding for his failure, the truth is that Azmaer never truly left his post but rather mummified himself in spidersilk and waited in undeath as a mummy to guard the Fane of Lolth for the return of the drow.</p>
