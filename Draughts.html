<p>Darughts , also known as checkers , was a board game and "one of the four universal games" of Faerûn along with chess , dice , and Talis .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Draughts was played on the same 8×8 checkered board as chess, but draughts was a much simpler game to learn and faster to play. It contained 24 pieces of two colors.</p>
<p>Sets in Faerûn often contained pieces made of clay or stone with a wooden board in a wooden case. Aurora's Emporium sold a more expensive set with red and black stone pieces.</p>
