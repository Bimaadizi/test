<p>The Gulf of Luiren was a sea created by the destruction and inundation of Luiren during the events of the Spellplague .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Gulf was shallow, with ruins just beneath the waves. The occasional tower broke the surface as did fortified island settlements.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Gulf covered nearly all of the land of Luiren save for the southern portion of the Lluirwood that sat on the eastern shore. The rising sea transformed Delzimmer into a port.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Luiren was submerged beneath the sea in the Year of the Halflings' Lament, 1386 DR , during the chaotic eaely years of the Spellplague. As of 1479 DR , it was still known as a “newborn sea”, and the ruins beneath the surface were still largely untouched by treasure hunters. By this time, trade across the Gulf's waters had become vital for places like Chavyondat and Delzimmer.</p>
<p>After the Second Sundering , the waters receded and revealed the land of Luiren once again.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In addition to the creatures one would normally find in a large body of salt water, the gulf was home to sahuagin , aquatic ogres and trolls and the ghosts of the former halfling residents of Luiren.</p>
<p>Not all halflings perished in the flooding, however. Many fled (to places like Delzimmer) while others survived and continued to live on secret island settlements until the Gulf drained in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
