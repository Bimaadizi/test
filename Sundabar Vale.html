<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sundabar Vale was a large bowl almost 60 miles in diameter, surrounded by a ring of mountains. The River Rauvin began in the Rauvin Mountains and flowed through the Vale, resulting in fertile farmlands, which fed the cities of the Silver Marches .</p>
<p>The valley was one of the most populated regions of the Marches, especially within the vicinity of Sundabar . It contained many settlements and small keeps, though they thinned out as one traveled east along the Fork Road , and few were located west of the river.</p>
<p>The weather in the valley was warmer than some of the surrounding regions of the Marches, but the land was also plagued with heavy fogs.</p>
