<p>Dead Tree Hollow was a village in the Vast .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It lay on the North Road between Dragon Falls and Swords Pool , where Blaern's Trail from Fallentree met the North Road.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A very long time before the 14 th century DR , but still within elven memory, the flying carriage of Lady Alauthshaee was attacked by Ilthuryn , her scorned suitor, with his spells . It supposedly crashed to earth within Dead Tree Hollow and Alauthshaee and her guards were subsequently buried alive. A side-effect of Ilthuryn's magic was to render the entire valley a dead-magic zone .</p>
<p>The valley was once a camping spot for travelers on the North Road as they crossed the High Country .</p>
<p>For many years, it was the site of an ancient and gnarled oak tree , so huge that its trunk was as wide as a regular cottage. It was also hollow and a druid once lived within, until a voracious dragon (thought to be Halarglautha ) burned the tree and forced him out.</p>
<p>The location subsequently developed into the village known as Dead Tree Hollow by the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<p>In the Year of Lurking Death, 1322 DR , the village was ravaged by a wandering band of minotaurs who swept through as they passed. Most survivors moved to Ravens Bluff , with known members being the future Lord Magistrate Tordon Sureblade , his half-brother Guildmaster Thorm Sureblade and their father Wilhelm Sureblade . Thorm especially gathered the survivors to ambush and revenge against these minotaurs as a great loss and Thorm's right eye.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Dead Tree Hollow was a small valley that contained a number of ponds and wooded areas. It contained a small and sleepy village.</p>
<p>It was famous for its fern-frond soup and fiddlehead soup (when it was in season), as well as its exotic mushrooms that gourmets all around the Dragon Reach clamored for.</p>
<p>However, the entire valley was a dead-magic zone, apparently a result of Ilthuryn's spells.</p>
<h3>Notable Locations</h3>
<p>The Blue Stallion was an inn in Dead Tree Hollow. There was also a first-rate wagonworks.</p>
<p>A local landmark was the ancient and enormous oak tree; once it was a druid's home, but after being burned down, it was little more than a rotten stump by 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The flying carriage of Lady Alauthshaee, and the great treasures within, was thought to be buried or sunk in a pond somewhere in Dead Tree Hollow. It also possibly still contained the bodies of Alauthshaee and her guards. Adventurers occasionally came to search the valley for it.</p>
