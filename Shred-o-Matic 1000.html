<p>The Shred-o-Matic 1000 was the unlucky potato peeling and dicing invention of Purfbin Doogrick , created sometime before 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Shred-o-Matic 1000 was created by young aspiring inventor Purfbin as he spent countless hours peeling potatoes in preparation for his burrow's annual grand feast, the New Harvest Festival . Purfbin convinced the event's Chief Cook Bitty Bitterbreath to present his grand invention to the panel of important guests that included the burrow's Mayor. The gnome fired the contraption up and guided it towards a pile of unpeeled potatoes, imagining the fame and respect the invention would bring him. Distracted, the youth lost control of Shred-o-Matic, and it went for the guests. The massacre resulted in the loss of Dame Edza 's prized wig and Mayor Whimblesnort 's expensive new silk hat. Doogrick's dreams of having his machine displayed at the High House of Wonders in Baldur's Gate alongside Baldric's Brilliant Blamblower and Gurn's Great Gnomeflinger were crushed while he was sent to peel potatoes alone in the cook's dark kitchens.</p>
