<p>Mystra's Temple in Hastarl was a place of worship in the 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The two front corners of the roof were adorned by bat-winged effigies that clutched columns on the front of the temple. There were faintly glowing letters over the double door at the entrance.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>By 229Â DR , the temple was largely dilapidated, but there were stone columns inside in the entry hall; the space was large enough that echoes were expected. The great circular chamber had a very high roof, a bare circular stone altar at its center, and three rows of balconies on the walls.</p>
<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
<p>It was possible to make light appear by calling for it.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Presumably, the temple had been used for worship at some point.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>During the reign of the Magelords of Athalantar , the temple doors had been locked; there were other spells inside preventing any echoes, and warning one of the magelords if anyone got in.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the Magelords of Athalantar took control of that kingdom, the Temple of Mystra was closed to the public, and wards were placed by Magelord Ildru , warning him of any intruders.</p>
<p>During late fall or early winter of Year of the Black Flame, 229 DR , Ildru captured Eladar the Dark, a thief who was secretly Prince Elminster Aumar after the latter broke into the temple, but before he could execute him, he was stopped by direct intervention from Mystra .</p>
