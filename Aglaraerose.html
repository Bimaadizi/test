<p>Aglaraerose was an ancient green dragon who lived in a mountain known as the Fang in the Forest in the Earthfast Mountains .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>She swallowed a Thayan wizard who was a master of life draining magic and absorbed his abilities. She was able to extend her life far beyond her normal lifespan by stealing the life force of other creatures.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Aglaraerose had a unique patch of rough scales on her belly.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As a young adult dragon, she often attacked brigands and ships in the Nelanther Isles . Some of her foes used powerful magics against her, which convinced her to move inland to the Shaar .</p>
<p>She disappeared from the historical record for centuries but reappeared in Veldorn in the 14th century DR, where she and the red dragon Klauth devoured a horde of orcs in the Spine of the World in 1339 DR . She retired to her lair soon after and slept for twelve years.</p>
<p>She re-emerged in 1351 DR to eat the entire Lost Caravan of Taeremel near Hardcastle in the Shaar.</p>
<p>Later, she forced a group of dwarves to build a trap-filled lair known as the Lure of Jaws , although she compensated them well and allowed them to depart with their lives. The dwarves spread the tale that a lone dragon slept in a lair filled with treasure, which attracted many adventurers, from whom she drained of their life forces.</p>
