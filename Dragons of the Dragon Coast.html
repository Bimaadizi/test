<p>Dragons of the Dragon Coast was a history book that offered a theory for the naming origin of the Dragon Coast and recorded history of the region's dragons through the centuries, published sometimt in or before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>The work stated that numerous theories existed on the origins of the term "Dragon Coast." The topic was quite contentious, with many passionate supporters of one theory over the others. Despite all the disagreements, all admitted that the name was an apt one, as the Dragon Coast was populated by the highest number of these massive flying beasts, and the region's history recorded many notable wyrms who shaped its past.</p>
<p>Most sages considered the dragon named Kisonraathiisar to be one of the most prominent wyrms of history. He was slain by Saldrinar of the Seven Spells in -349 DR . But even that part of the region's history was obfuscated by legends. Some believed that Kisonraathiisar was trapped within an enchanted scepter so that the wielder could conjure Kisonraathiisar's spells at will. In turn, Saldrinar made history by founding the city of Westgate atop his lair and ruling it as the first king. Some historians claimed that the Purple Dragon of Cormyr was the Dragon Coast's inspiration, while others attributed the name to Kuldrak the Many-Taloned , a gargantuan red dragon who laired in the very southern mountains of the Thunder Peaks , long before Thauglor the Purple Dragon hatched. Kuldrak was killed by Rauthstokh "Redbones", a parent of the god-dragon Tchazzar . However, there were other candidates – Arauvrim , a small but vicious fang dragon who preyed on sailors and fishers out at sea, terrorizing for ten bloody years until he was petrified by a powerful shipborne mage and plunged to the bottom of Dragonmere . Another possible candidate was Larithylar , perhaps the most terrifying monster of all. She was known to possess bodies of creatures, including, possibly, possessing one of the dragons listed above, and still being alive as of the late 14 th century DR. Larithylar, also known as "the Chameleon Dragon," was a lamia sorceress who learned magical ways of inhabiting human , humanoid , and draconic forms, and even learned to posess and controll powerful true dragon . Larithylar faked her own death centuries before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR and, by some accounts, still inhabited Westgate, seeking powerful magical items for some nefarious plot.</p>
