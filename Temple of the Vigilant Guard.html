<p>The Temple of the Vigilant Guard was a temple dedicated to Helm in the city of Iljak . It was considered one of the five major temples of Helm in the Vilhon Reach in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , priests from this temple captured a lich in Chondalwood by the name of Hlura the Ebonsoul . Finding themselves unable to destroy her, the Helmite priests trapped her within a coffin made of silver and sealed it with both several layers of magic and molten silver. They then took Hlura and the evil artifacts in her lair back to Iljak. These belongings were rumored to include a mirror of life trapping , a staff of the magi , seven different types of magical wands , and most treasured of all, three scrolls of beaten metal.</p>
<p>Once back home, the Temple of the Vigilant Guard contracted a merchant ship by the name of Thepurl's Diamond to transport these goods across the Sea of Fallen Stars to the Temple of the Noble Hand in Tsurlagol , wherein lived Helmites powerful enough to permanently destroy them. Seven Helmite crusaders , adorned in Plate mail , alongside three priests brought the imprisoned lich and her artifacts on to the ship within huge crates that made the Diamond's captain reluctant to take the job. Determined to see the evil vanquished, the Helmites paid them in a thousand scarlet pearls from the Lake of Steam .</p>
<p>On Mirtul 10 , Thepurl's Diamond set sail from Iljak. It was expected to reach its destination after a month of travel and two stops along the way to the ports of Reth and Delthuntle . However, the ship would come to mysteriously sink 3 miles (4,800 meters) west of the island of Shamandra , after having sailed past its western cape. Thepurl's Diamond and its evil cargo came to rest along the upper slopes of one of the Mountains of Volar . While the Helmites that were on the ship were never heard from again, having likely drowned due to the weight of their plate mail.</p>
