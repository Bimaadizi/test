<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR Kella went to Nightstone posing as an itinerant monk. In truth she had originally planned to occupy the village in name of the Zhent , driving away the Lionshield Coster and bullying Lady Velrosa Nandar . For this she had recruited the help of the Seven Snakes . However, a bombardment from a cloud giant castle left the city almost abandoned and defenseless, changing Kella's plan into just waiting for the arrival of her associates and conquering the city. She remained hidden in the village's tavern while the goblin raiding the various buildings.</p>
