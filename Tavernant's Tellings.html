<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the late 14 th century DR, the printing industry was still young, and the printing press's services were exuberantly-priced. Eccentric elderly Lady Tavernant opened Tavernant's Tellings simply because she grew tired of hand-writing invitations to her many parties and paying others for the service.</p>
<p>The shop was extremely popular and was always swarmed by traders ordering advertisement broadsheets, menus, announcements, and memorandums. Several competitor merchants were working on opening their own printshops to claim a slice of the lucrative business. Tavernant's Tellings has a somewhat annoying reputation among owners of stone buildings in Suzail that often became plastered by glued printer broadsheets, leading them to torch the posted papers off the walls nightly. This practice was the origin of the Suzailan term "scorched news."</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, Tavernant's Tellings remained in business with its name unchanged.</p>
