<p>Shou Lung emeralds , known as the bureaucrat's stone in Kara-Tur , had a rich color and were highly valued in western Faer√ªn . A legend surrounding these stones held that there were only three of them in existence, but this was clearly a myth as there were at least a dozen known stockpiles of them in various locations around the West.</p>
