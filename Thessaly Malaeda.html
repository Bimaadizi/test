<p>"Thessaly Malaeda" was the assumed name of a succubus agent of the demon lord Graz'zt in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1486 DR , the succubus posed as Thessaly Malaeda, the recently arrived sister of Davon Malaeda , the closest advisor of First Lord Torin Nomerthal (in truth, Davon had been replaced by the incubus Ruexohn ). Thessaly seduced Nomerthal and Ruexohn convinced him that he needed to marry Thessaly. So the First Lord organized the First Lord's Midsummer Masquerade ball in order to announce his marriage to all the wealthiest citizens of Hillsfar.</p>
<p>As planned, at this point an elf assassin (in truth, a fiendish doppelganger ) ruined the announcement of the marriage by attacking Thessaly. Ruexohn and Thessaly prepared to escape but an adventuring party hired by Elanil Elassidil to gather intelligence about Hillsfar unveiled them and fought and killed them.</p>
