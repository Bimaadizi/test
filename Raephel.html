<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1362 DR , Raephel was present in the Society of Stalwart Adventurers guildhall when Artus Cimber's magical guardian named a young but haughty guild-member Ariast . The dwarf was surrounded by his fellow dwarven adventurers and passed the time by flicking gold coins onto the dining hall's chandeliers, surrounded by copious dirty plates and ale mugs. This game sometimes lasted for days.</p>
