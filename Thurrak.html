<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was the husband of Ghunda , a fellow elder of the tribe. However, they differed greatly in their outlooks and willingness to talk with strangers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point, Thurrak's tribe witnessed the construction of the Shrine of the Claw by the kuo-toa on the Lake of Shadows . After a time, war erupted between Thurrak's tribe and the kuo-toa and the stone giants eventually reduced the shrine to rubble. Eventually, the giants and the kuo-toa came to a truce, with the stone giants even helping to rebuild the shrine.</p>
<h3>Silence of Lolth</h3>
<p>In 1372 DR , a kuo-toa leader known as the Claw rose to power and began inciting the kuo-toa to renew their attacks on the giants. Then, during the Silence of Lolth , drow refugees from Maerimydra killed several of Thurrak's tribe on their way to Szith Morcane . After that, Thurrak was on the lookout for ways to turn the problem of the drow's displacement to an advantage for his kind. To that end, he was willing to work with travelers seeking passage across the lake if they helped remove the Claw.</p>
