<p>Florozt'a , who more commonly went by Rozt'a , was a traveling guardswoman that offered her services throughout the Western Heartlands during the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was a tall and broad-shouldered woman, with unruly blonde hair that was kept short, cut just above her ears.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was a simple, down-to-earth woman with a strong sense for people. While she recognized the usefulness of magic for people in her walk of life, she did not concern herself much with such complexities. Interestingly enough, Rozt'a was familiar with and regularly exclaimed to the overdeity Ao , the being whose presence was only briefly revealed to the Realms during the Time of Troubles .</p>
<p>While she had strong maternal instincts and was naturally protective of others, Rozt'a had a bad temper and was not shy about openly sharing her thoughts on any given subject. The only real exception to her blunt honesty arose when it regarded her foster son Tiep. While she usually had no problem expressing her anger, Rozt'a would avoid conflict when she experienced true emotionally pain. In the instances she felt truly betrayed, she would rather shun the person than confront them directly about the matter.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>In addition to her fighting prowess, Rozt'a knew a number of home remedies that helped ease the rigors of life on the road. She would seep Wyndor's herbs for her companions when needed, making a tea that would nearly immobilize a person, but also help them heal from injury.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Rozt'z preferred to wear leather armor during her travels and armed herself with her trusted sword. She did also keep a number of knives strapped to her person as well.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The stalwart warrior served as her family's protector during journeys across the Heartlands.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Rozt'a became infatuated with her traveling companion Druhallen shortly after their meeting, while she simultaneously gained the affections of his foster brother and dearest friend Galimer . While she and Dru enjoyed a relationship for a year or two, along with a year-long engagement that was more-or-less endured, the mage did not love Rozt'a as she did him. Despite this messy history and hard years together on the road, Rozt'a still very much loved her husband Galimer.</p>
<p>While traveling with her family earning a living in the Western Heartlands , Rozt'a very much played the role of mother to the young lad Tiep . She absolutely adored the boy, and as many mothers, made excuses for him when he made mistakes; and, while Tiep struggled to treat her as a mother due to the years he spent as an orphan, in his heart Tiep felt that she was the closest thing he had to a mother.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time around Year of the Worm, 1356 DR , Rozt'a began working as a bodyguard for a Zhentilar captain in Triel , but was forced to turn away his advances one too many times. She left the city east along the Dusk Road where she met two traveling wizards, Druhallen and Galimer, and offered them her services as their protector. Rozt'a and Dru became involved with one another in short time and, in the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , the guardswoman was blessed with an unexpected pregnancy. When on the road back to their home in Scornubel , Rozt'a shared the news with Dru and was met with panic and dereliction of responsibility. Dru fled the city and abandoned his companions until Spring of the following year. Rozt'a found consolation with Galimer and the two were wed in Berdusk . Unfortunately, the daughter they planned to raise together did not live all the way to childbirth. While recovering in the city's temple of Chauntea , Rozt'a and Galimer met a young orphan named Tiep, whom they adopted as their own son.</p>
<p>While Galimer lined up work the following year, Rozta's ongoing recovery left them with few prospects. When Druhallen returned to his freinds after his elopement, he was welcomed back with open arms, and the trio set out on the road once again. They continued their travels across the Western Heartlands , for years until the fates finally aligned with something greater in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR . Druhallen finally convinced his companions to make the journey to Dekanter they had planned on for so many years. While the road to the mines were closed down just the year before , they were given new opportunity by the goblin named Sheemzher , a particularly intelligent and well-mannered creature that beckoned them to Weathercote Wood in order to meet his mistress, Lady Wyndyfarh .</p>
<p>During the journey through the woods, Tiep broke away from his parents, stole bits of amber from the trees along a path to the Lady's glade, and carelessly killed some of her awakened insect servants. When they appeared at an audience before the mysterious and powerful Lady Wyndyfarh, she accused Tiep of the crimes he had just recently committed, and Galimer challenged her authority on the matter. In the blink of an eye, Wyndyfarh teleported Galimer away, and presented Rozt'a and Dru with an offer: travel to the old mines of Dekanter and recover one of the lost Nether Scrolls , and Galimer would be returned unharmed.</p>
<p>The group braved the perils of the Greypeak Mountains together, traveling across fetid bogs and along treacherous mountainside paths before reaching the entrance to the Dekanter mines. The first couple days of the journey were taxing on the group, causing growing tensions between Rozt'a and Druhallen. As they journeyed to and within Dekanter, the companions were forced to stick together despite dire circumstances, draw upon inner strength of which they may not have been aware, and sacrifice of themselves for their fellow companions. They managed to recover the Nether Scroll , distract the monstrous ruler of Dekanter known as the Beast Lord , and flee the mines with their lives.</p>
<p>During their journey back to Weathercote Wood, Tiep revealed to Rozt'a that he had been working with Amarandaris in the past as well as the debt he owed Lord Sememmon of Darkhold . Rozt'a shut a part of herself down emotionally, and would not even acknowledge Tiep's existence. She offered Druhallen an ultimatum, Tiep would leave before they recovered Galimer or she would. Dru came up with a plan to help Tiep from fully succumbing to the Zhentarim's influence, and they were all able to reunite with Galimer altogether. Rozt'a did not immediately share with Galimer Tiep's betrayal, and Dru did all he could to ensure they had the best possible chance to remain a united family in the face of all they had encountered.</p>
