<p>The Rose and Hammer was a comfortable inn found within the town of Deadsnows , in Luruar , during the midâ€“14 th century DR . Its friendly atmosphere and moderate prices attracted many travelers, especially during the local gold rush of 1372 DR . While it didn't have the exclusivity of a stay at the Icespear House , it was far and away a nicer rest than what could be found outside Deadsnows' walls in Snowtown.</p>
<p>The inn earned its name from its owners and proprietors, a married couple, Rose and Hendrick "the Hammer" Torlund . They were good-natured and welcoming folk.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Seeing as it was the only actual inn within the walls of Deadsnows, the Rose and Hammer had ample accommodations for travelers, prospectors, or other potential patrons. It had twelve private rooms, which could each sleep two, at a cost of 4 gp per night. The common dormitory could house up to twenty guests, at 6 sp a night.</p>
<p>Lodging at the inn included two meals a day, though the quality left much to be desired. Meat for the meals was provided by local hunters while the vegetables came from the gardens of the local abbey.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Rose and Hammer was utterly destroyed, along with the rest of Deadsnows, during the Spellplague in the year 1385 DR . Along with those of the Icespear House, the ruins of the Rose and Hammer were all that remained of the previously booming village.</p>
