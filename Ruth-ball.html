<p>Ruth-balls were a type of deep-fried handfoods made out of seasoned ground chickpeas . The uncooked and unshaped mixture was referred to simply as ruth ( pronounced : / r ʌ s t / rust ).</p>

<p>Ruth-balls were common across the Realms. Volothamp Geddarm savored the best ruth-balls on the island of Tashalar and in the city of Sammaresh of Lapaliiya . Ruth-balls served in Waterdeep , Westgate , and Selgaunt were also of surprising quality. Apparently, this opinion was somewhat controversial.</p>
