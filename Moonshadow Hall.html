<p>Moonshadow Hall was the temple of Selûne in Yhaunn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The temple was located in the center of Yhaunn, and was visible from a far distance as a large, circular structure of pale stone. It predated most other buildings in Yhaunn, and was older and larger than most temples of Selûne in the region as well. Most of it was two floors tall, except for in the north where a third level extended.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Around the outer walls were depictions of owls and the relief sculptures of the seven Shards . The walls had false gates for each of the phases of the moon, with only the full moon gate accessible. The temple was originally designed as a fortification, with tall, smooth walls and inward-facing windows. Atop the walls were walkways with parapets and guardhouses, and a short belltower over the gate, though by 1373 DR the fortifications had fallen into disrepair.</p>
<p>In the center of the temple was a grass-covered courtyard with a sacred pool of water, built above ground with a containing stone wall. The courtyard was surrounded by cloisters with eight gates, each one representing a different phase of the moon. By tradition, at night one could only pass through the gate that corresponded with the phase of the moon. Further complicating it, the new moon gate was bricked up, making the courtyard inaccessible during the new moon.</p>
<p>A small walled herb garden was attached to the outside wall of the temple, accessible through the kitchen. The winter chapel was another later construction, a large round structure added to the north side of the temple that was used when the weather was too harsh to perform services in the courtyard.</p>
<p>A long dining hall filled with tables lay on the ground floor. On the opposite side to the kitchen, the infirmary contained sick beds and medical supplies for treatment. It was adjacent to an externally-locked secure room that was used for containing the werewolf Feena Archwood as a child when she involuntarily transformed and lost control. It was later used for storing clean linens.</p>
<p>The dormitories were located on the second floor of the temple, with the High Moonmistress's quarters furthest from the ramp that led down to the ground floor. The ramp leading up to the third floor was close to the Moonmistress, and led up to the archives, which sat atop the northern quarter of the temple.</p>
<p>The third floor was only built atop the northern end of the temple. The archive was filled with scrolls, tomes, and other records spanning hundreds of years and gathered from countless other temples and shrines across Faerûn . It was secured with heavy ironbound doors to protect the records within.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 757 DR , High Moonmistress Jolara Nightnever gave support to High Moonmistress Brima Chintamn of Bright Lady's Tower in Chancelgaunt , condemning the New Moon Pact . Shortly after, Bright Lady's Tower was abandoned and demolished, and its archives were transferred to Moonshadow Hall. That same year, Asha the Silent joined the temple, eventually became High Moonmistress, and worked to preserve the legacy of the Pact through The Book of the New Moon .</p>
<p>Around 1358 DR , the High Moonmistress was Dhauna Myritar . In her time she instituted a feast called the New Moon Beneficence , a charitable event that fed the poor of the city and brought cheer to the darkest phase of the moon.</p>
<p>In 1373 DR , Dhauna received warning nightmares from Selûne and attempted to discover the meaning behind them. She summoned Feena Archwood from Archendale to act as her Moonmistress-Designate and began researching from the archives, eventually discovering the lost history of the New Moon Pact.</p>
<p>Tragically, Dhauna had lost her mind to desperation and forced Feena to infect her with lycanthropy , only to be mercy-killed by Feena in turn, who then briefly became High Moonmistress. Shortly after, the priestess Velsinore was exposed as a dangerous heretic, and the temple was attacked by Variance Amatick and the local temple of Shar as part of a plan to seize The Leaves of One Night .</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, the temple survived, Feena refounded the New Moon Pact, and Julith Harkspur was chosen by Feena to be the new High Moonmistress. As a favor, Feena asked that she have the blocked new moon cloister gate opened up.</p>
<p>Around 1379 DR , a force of Shadovar Netherese assaulted the temple, tearing part of it off with their magic and banishing it to the Shadowfell . This lost fragment became known as the Shard of Night , and the Shadovar continued to use it in their activities.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In 1358 DR , the High Moonmistress was Dhauna Myritar , with 29 subordinate priests.</p>
