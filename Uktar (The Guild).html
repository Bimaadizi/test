<p>Uktar was a member of The Guild and its elected bursar in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Uktar was a human man who named himself after the month of Uktar , also known as the Rotting. He hid his face behind an ornate porcelain mask with only red vein-like marks stretching from his face, betraying his scars or an affliction of some kind. He had a fair skin tone and black hair gathered in a tight ponytail. He preferred to wear emerald -green robes with the Guild's telltale colors.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As the Guild's bursar, Uktar managed the organization's financial affairs and offered a bounty for unique keys that unlocked vaults of certain individuals within the Counting House 's vaults. These sought after keys belonged to Cazador Szarr , Lord Gortash , Rakath Glitterbeard , Allandra Grey , Lady Jannath , Lorroakan , Ulder Ravengard , Viconia De Vir , and even Nine-Fingers herself.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Uktar gained the position and the Guildmaster's year sometime in or before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . He kept an eye on the illicit activities in the Chionthar Valley , including documenting the rise to power of a petty weapons dealer, Enver Gortash , him pushing out the Knights of the Shield and the Zhentarim from Baldur's Gate and eventually, becoming a lord. In contrast to Nine-Fingers, Uktar appeared to be cold and calculating. He advised Keene to be strict and punish those unable to pay for protection in order to show no signs of weakness. When the city of Baldur's Gate was infiltrated by the Cult of the Absolute , the Guild found itself losing territory to the new faction, especially with the dreaded Stone Lord working as the organization's muscle. Uktar thought that, at the very least, those who could not pay for protection should lose the said protection even if it were an orphanage, while Nine-Fingers claimed that there was nothing to demand out of orphans and that withdrawing protection meant giving up more territory to the Stone Lord. But Uktar did not realize that Nine-Fingers was not benevolent and instead ordered her men to seize the orphanage building and arm children old enough to fight the Cult and protect the building claimed by the Guild.</p>
