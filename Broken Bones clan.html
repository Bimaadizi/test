<p>The Broken Bones clan was a group of raiding goblins who operated out of the forests in Shadowdale around 1369 DR . They would attack travelers in the area with hit-and-run tactics at night, ambushing from underbrush. The goblins were ultimately cowards and would retreat from battles if their forces dropped beneath half.</p>
