<p>The Harpell ( pronounced : /ˈ h ɑːr p ɛ l / HAR-pell ) family was an eccentric clan of wizards who, for the most part, lived in the Ivy Mansion in Longsaddle in the Savage Frontier of northwest Faerûn . Despite their eccentricity and their strange experiments, they were well known for collectively having a vast knowledge of the history and geography of the North .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>They were a kind-hearted clan, but their magic was capricious, sometimes backfiring in peculiar ways. As members of the Lords' Alliance , they were firm allies of Mithral Hall , despite their unreliability as magicians.</p>
<h2>Scholarship</h2>
<p>After the Harpells interviewed Drizzt Do'Urden about the drow in 1356 DR , they published a treatise on the drow that was distributed to notable leaders and leading wizards. This was known as the Harpell treatise or the Harkle treatise . The treatise mentioned that drow liked to eat animals that were still alive because it gave the meat a better flavor.</p>
<h2>The Ivy Mansion</h2>
<p>The Ivy Mansion consisted of three main buildings: two that looked like simple farmhouses and a unique, heavily spired central house. The mansion was surrounded by a fence of magic that, while normally invisible, had been painted to look like a fence. The mansion grounds also featured an "Underbridge/Overbridge" that arched over an uphill-flowing stream—to get to the mansion, you walked upside-down on the underside of the bridge, and to leave the mansion grounds you walked on the top side. There was also a stable full of strange animal creations and miniaturized mounts.</p>
<p>Inside the Ivy Mansion was the Fuzzy Quarterstaff , a tavern and inn run by the Harpells. The main room of the tavern consisted of a circular room and a wizard conducting an invisible orchestra. Guests could order drinks from a magical green gem placed on every table; the drinks were then brought to them on magical floating blue disks.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1245 DR , the Harpells' conflict with the Talonmist family of Westbridge began when Ordrar Talonmist was killed in a spell duel by Darnthal Harpell .</p>
<p>For generations, the Harpells gave Longsaddle more prestige in the North than its size and purpose would warrant. This tradition began with mighty Authrar Harpell , who was famous in the North for single-handedly destroying an onrushing orc horde with spells.</p>
<p>Catti-brie , under the name of "Delly Curtie," dwelt and studied magic with the Harpells in Longsaddle from 1479 to 1482 DR . She was considered nearly family, to the point some suggested she be "ordained a Harpell."</p>
