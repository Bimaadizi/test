<p>Ogiyon Tomain was a werewolf from around Eveningstar in Cormyr during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ogiyon was a large, white werewolf.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar in the 1480s DR, a group of Purple Dragons were attacked by beasts in the King's Forest . They returned to the Eveningstar War Hospital , only for it to transpire that at least one of them was infected with lycanthropy . One night, the head priest of the hospital Hurim Jaskyr was brutally murdered and torn to pieces, to the shock and horror of the patients and staff. Healer Delethir Mistveil accepted the aid of adventurers and bid them investigate, only for nightfall to reveal the presence of multiple werewolves within the hospital. After a running battle, the surviving patients were able to open the front doors and escape the bloodbath, only for Ogiyon Tomain and his wolfy companions to charge in and seek vengeance for their lost kin. Though fearsome, Ogiyon did not survive the battle.</p>
