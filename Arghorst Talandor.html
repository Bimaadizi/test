<h2>History</h2>
<p>He defeated the previous Magister , Phambra Chalyphar , by goading her into a rage, being already prepared to defeat her.</p>
<p>As the Magister, he became largely beloved by being indiscriminately helpful to all wizards he came across. His end came ultimately when one of his students took advantage of his good will by running him low on spells, and then challenging him to a duel on the spot.</p>
<p>After his death, he became one of Mystra 's most favored shadowstaves . He was occassionally allowed to return to flesh and blood to help a mage in need of insight, if they prayed to Mystra.</p>
