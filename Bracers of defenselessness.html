<p>Bracers of defenselessness were cursed bracers that impeded the wearer's defenses.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They resembled bracers of defense .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>While they normally operated identically to bracers of defense , in response to a dangerous enemy, these bracers changed function from bolstering the user's defense to completely thwarting it. Once donned, these bracers could only be removed through the use of a remove curse spell or similar. By the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , they were known to be tremendous hindrances, but no longer reported to thwart completely all of the user's defenses.</p>
<p>Versions described after the Spellplague were instead considered a specific property that was held in addition to whatever other capabilities a given device bore. In response to sufficient damage, the bracers' curse manifested for as long as combat continued, adding a notable hindrance to the user's defense and protection.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Per sages, the curse creating bracers of powerlessness came from a mispronounced word while the rite used to create other protective items was being devised; the faulty ceremony, with its mispronounced word, was still used by some, leading to the creation of these items down the centuries.</p>
<p>One of the wedding gifts from Tan Chin to Princess Tsenya Bhrokiti in the Year of the Helm, 1362 DR was a pair of bracers of defenselessness .</p>
<p>There was likely at least one set in a watery chamber of Undermountain , loaded with dead and well-decomposed bodies, in the 1360s DR.</p>
<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
<p>There were a pair of such bracers in the hoard of the dragon turtle Perizade .</p>
