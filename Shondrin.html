<p>Shondrin was a retired sailor of the Sword Coast and the proprietor of Shondrin's Packsack of Plenty in the settlement of Bargewright Inn in the Savage Frontier in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was a fat and jovial fellow, and full of wild stories from his seafaring days.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>From "the Pack", Shondrin sold all sorts of things, including dry goods and an assortment of practical supplies, like candles , rope , and outerwear clothing. Shondrin occasionally accepted items in trade, which he sold in the store. Hence, it included some secondhand items such as hardware and old armor and weaponry and even magical items , though Shondrin rarely dealt in them knowingly. If Shondrin didn't have what a customer wanted in stock, he could tell them the nearest place they could find it, which might be as far as Waterdeep , Athkatla , or even Calimport . While this wasn't always helpful, it was a point of pride to Shondrin that he had complete, up-to-date knowledge of all legal, open-market vendors.</p>
<p>His house stood at the very center of the settlement, between the Rise and the Back streets and next door to Rinthar 's house.</p>
