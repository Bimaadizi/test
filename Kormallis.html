<p>The Kormallis ( pronounced : /ˈ k ɔːr m ɑː l i s / KOR-mal-eess ) family were part of the nobility of Waterdeep in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . They recruited people for mercenary work or other jobs that required adventurer -types. They also had an interest in supplying travel-related gear to folks on the move. Sometime in the darker part of their history, they dabbled in the slave trade.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Lord Helm Kormallis (nicknamed "The Torturer") was the patriarch of the family from at least the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , to at least the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . He had no consort in 1372 and technically his heir was his eldest son, Harkas Kormallis , but Harkas was not interested in the title as he had dedicated his life to the service of Tyr . If Harkas renounced the title, it would then fall to Helm's younger brother Pall .</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , the seneschal of the estate was secretly a refugee of the Tethyrian Interregnum and his son, Felvor Elcaskur , was a Scion (priest) of Siamorphe .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Kormallis family had a villa in the North Ward at the southeast corner of Hassantyr's Street and Ussilbran Street . It consisted of a few one- and two-story buildings inside a walled compound. Endcliff Lane touched the back side of the property.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>House Kormallis was involved in slave trading in the first half of the 13 th century DR , before they were ennobled. In the Year of the Cockatrice, 1248 DR , when over two dozen families were inducted into the nobility, the Lords of Waterdeep required them to renounce slavery as part of the process. When the Kormallis family was elevated to the nobility in the Year of the Wilted Flowers, 1258 DR , they publicly declared they had ceased slave trafficking, but did not completely abandon the illegal practice until the Year of the Wagon, 1273 DR .</p>
