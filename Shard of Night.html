<p>The Shard of Night , later known as the Shard of the Moon , was a mysterious tower floating amid the air in the River District of Neverwinter .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This bleak tower of black stone was floating above a cluster of apartments in the River District. It seemed to have been sheared off at its base when it was torn from its original location.</p>
<p>The Shard of Night had the ability to "eat" shadows and darkness, and creatures that walked under the tower in daylight had their shadows temporarily absorbed by the tower. At night, the tower cast its ominous shadow over the River District if there was moonlight. Neverwintans avoided the place for this reason.</p>
<p>Inside the tower there was located a teleportation circle , originally connected to a Netherese camp near Xinlenal . To enter the tower from the outside, a keyword spoken out loud at night could create stairs of solidified shadows. The Shard was also accessible from within the Shadowfell city of Evernight , however it was heavily fortified by the shadovar . Attempts to gain unauthorized access could result in one being torn apart by the spirits of the dead.</p>
<p>After the tower was purified by Selûne , in 1479 DR , it was returned to its original appearance of alabaster stone, and the stairs conjured by the keyword were of solidified moonlight instead.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1379 DR , Netherese forces attacked Moonshadow Hall and tore apart one of its towers, sending it to the Shadowfell, where the tower was warped by the shadowy realm. Later experiments allowed the Netherese to control where and how the tower manifested in the mortal realms .</p>
<p>During the Spellplague of 1385 DR , the Netherese took advantage of the magical chaos to send the Shard of Night to Neverwinter, with the intention of using it to further their plans in the area when needed. This tower was later renamed "the Shard of Night" by the Neverwintans.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR , the Netherese were using the Shard to spy on Neverwinter. One of their agents in Evernight, Kaross , slew any Neverwintans who learned of their operations.</p>
<p>In 1479 DR, a group of adventurers seeking the Shards of Selûne raided the Shard of Night, defeating the guards there and allowing Lady Jasmine and other selûnite priests to recover the tower. The Shard of Night was later purified, reconsecrated to Selûne by using the power of the Shards , and became a beacon of hope in Neverwinter. The Neverwintans began to call it "the Shard of the Moon" afterwards.</p>
