<p>House Xorlarrin was a drow house formerly of Menzoberranzan . It had been considered the "most magical" house of that city. The entire house relocated to Q'Xorlarrin in Gauntlgrym in 1484 DR .</p>
<h2>Citadel Xorlarrin</h2>
<p>House Xorlarrin was based in Spelltower Xorlarrin , located on the plateau of Qu'ellarz'orl . A slender spire, the walls were striped in permanent and ever-shifting faerie fire , with battlements set atop its high walls.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The house was famous for its wizards , even giving the males status near to the females, meaning they were one of the few groups that did not fit the paradigm of drow males in Menzoberranzan. Matron Mother Zeerith would even listen to the men, as she relied more on advisors than other matriarchs. The wizards had more arcane power than any other house, and those who had no skill would not survive childhood. Such talentless males were used as sacrifices. In 1361 DR , there were seven masters of Sorcere from House Xorlarrin.</p>
<p>After the Spellplague , magic users of House Xorlarrin were known as "spellspinners" and utilized a different form of magic from those who practiced before the Spellplague.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>14th and 15th centuries DR</h3>
<p>By 1372 DR , House Xorlarrin was the fifth house. It was the primary assailant on House Agrach Dyrr after that house's betrayal of the city to the Jaezred Chaulssin and duergar armies during the Siege of Menzoberranzan .</p>
<p>By the late 15th century DR , Xorlarrin had reached the position of third house of Menzoberranzan. House Xorlarrin was a strong supporter of Lolth 's plan to create a Demon Weave . Many lesser wizards joined the Council of Spiders . The house itself was inclined to support the Council's cause, even at the cost of civil war.</p>
<h3>Q'Xorlarrin</h3>
<p>In 1463 DR , House Xorlarrin divined information from a private conversation between the brothers Jarlaxle and Gromph Baenre when the former was investigating the Dawn Titan ( primordial ) imprisoned in Gauntlgrym . Matron Zeerith sent out an expedition, lead by Ravel Xorlarrin , which sought to establish a new drow city in the dwarven ruins. This was something the house had long thought to do, but they were afraid of retribution from House Baenre and House Barrison Del'Armgo . However, with the appointment of Tiago Baenre to the expedition, it was understood that House Xorlarrin would be permitted by Matron Quenthel Baenre to form a new city, so long as it served the Spider Queen .</p>
<p>In 1484 DR , House Xorlarrin was finally permitted to leave Menzoberranzan and form a new city in Gauntlgrym called Q'Xorlarrin , where they produced fine weapons at the Forge. They were obligated to trade with and pay tribute to Menzoberranzan and serve in House Baenre's army if called upon. In light of the house's departure, Quenthel Baenre restored House Do'Urden with a number of drow nobles (and later non-drow) and made it a member of the Ruling Council .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Slaves and soldiers of House Xolarrin mined Lustrum , a rich mithral mine 20 miles from the Pillars of Woe in the direction of Menzoberranzan. It was abandoned by 1372 DR .</p>
<p>From 1463 DR onward, House Xorlarrin possessed the Forge and much of Gauntlgrym, where they created fine weapons to export to Menzoberranzan.</p>
