<p>Needle's Bones was a massive grotto, resembling a sinkhole, located in the jungles of Chult .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The walls of the cavity were sheer rock, covered in vines and moss. The bottom was covered by a shallow pool of murky green water that was full of skeletal remains.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally, this landmark served as the lair of the green dragon Ormalagos .</p>
<p>At some point the nearby batiri goblins concocted a plan to slay the dragon commonly known as Needle. They trapped her with nets and pelted her with spears while schools of carnivorous quippers consumed her from below. Ormalagos was slain and the tribe of goblins were nearly completely eradicated.</p>
