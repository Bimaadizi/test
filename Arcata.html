<p>The Duchy of Arcata was a province in the Kingdom of Damara in the Cold Lands .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The start of the Bloodstone Wars was marked by a conflict between Arcata and the neighboring Barony of Bloodstone , in which Duke William Horgath attempted to seize the bloodstone mines in Baron Gareth Dragonsbane 's territory. The attack was ill-prepared and hundreds of Arcatans died before peace was instated by Gareth in what became known as Gareth's Gamble .</p>
<p>The resolution of the conflict led to the concentration of both armies against the threats to the south led many of the Arcatan people to favor unification with the Barony of Bloodstone under Gareth Dragonsbane's rule as king. Rumors were rife in 1359 DR that the Ducal Guard in Valls were loyal to Gareth instead of William.</p>
