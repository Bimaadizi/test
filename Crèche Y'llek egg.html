<p>The Crèche Y'llek egg was a githyanki egg laid in Crèche Y'llek , though it had trouble hatching. Xan or Ptaris were the names possibly given to it were it to be taken away from the Crèche, depending on whose custody it was in upon hatching.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Xan's egg was laid in Crèche Y'llek, a githyanki stronghold in the Western Heartlands , within the remains of Rosymorn Monastery . The eggs within the hatchery were destined to become warriors in service to Vlaakith CLVII . However, Xan's egg fell behind its peers and failed to hatch on time. Varsh Ko'kuu , the overseer of the hatchery, was determined to ensure the egg's survival, but under increasing pressure from Kith'rak Therezzyn , he reluctantly considered terminating it.</p>
<p>That year, the Absolute Adversaries may have arrived at the crèche seeking a cure for their illithid tadpoles using the zaith'isk .</p>
