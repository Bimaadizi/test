<p>Lichens were a type of composite organism, often confused for being solely a plant or fungi , when in fact they were a composite of both. They could be found in various places across the Realms.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lichen came in a wide variety of forms and colorations. There were many poisonous varieties, some that were capable of defending themselves, some that were bioluminescent, and some that were phosphorescent. Bioluminescence was somewhat of a rare trait for lichen.</p>
<h2>Habitats</h2>
<p>On the surface of Toril , one could find lichen in a variety of locations. These included the Cormanthor forest's starwood area, the Evermoors north of the Dessarin Valley , the High Moor 's rocky outcrops, the Plains of Purple Dust , and the peaks of the Sunset Mountains .</p>
<p>They were most abundant underneath the surface of Toril, in the area known as the Underdark , where they and other vegetation received nourishment from the ambient faerzress . Areas particularly diverse in lichen included the cavern of Ched Nasad , Fluvenilstra , Gduar's Garden , and Neverlight Grove .</p>
<p>Phosphorescent and bioluminescent lichen were common in the Underdark, though the latter were were more common in the Upperdark than the Middledark . Both could be found in parts of the Wormwrithings . A silvery-blue variety could be found all across the ceiling of Iltkazar 's cavern. The fortress Maelstrom had many rooms decorated in bioluminescent lichen. And Neverlight Grove had blue, violet, and yellow bioluminescent lichen growing across its caverns and larger mushrooms.</p>
<p>Beyond Toril , primitive lichen could be found on the planet Armistice . Outside of the Prime Material plane , a species of red and black lichen could be found in the Abyss , the realm of the goddess of misfortune Beshaba . The lichen was growing on the wind-blasted rocks of the Blood Tor .</p>
