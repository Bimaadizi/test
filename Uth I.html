<h2>History</h2>
<p>Uth I was a Lord of Tavaray until he was exiled. He moved to a small port settlement in the region south of Leilon and, in 146 DR, he built Uthtower on a rocky hill near the coast. He brought a company of Shoon mercenaries with him, and proclaimed himself king, intending to build a great realm from this first settlement. He had brought with him a great deal of personal wealth from Tavaray and used this to pay off anyone who was opposed to him seizing power.</p>
<p>Uth I began to feel the effects of age around 158 DR and allowed his eldest son Ornoth Myrmoran to run the government. He died a decade later in the Year of Scattered Stars, 168 DR .</p>
<p>King Uth I's and Queen Sarlani's crypts were located below the ruins of the Uthtower in what eventually became the Mere of Dead Men .</p>
