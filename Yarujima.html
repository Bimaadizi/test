<p>Yarujima was an island located in Kozakura .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Yarujima, often referred to as Exile Island , earned its name for it being a place of confinement for political prisoners.</p>
<p>Yarujima was located between Shinkoku and Hinomoto . Its solitary ridge covered in lush vegetation emerged from the ocean, sharply descending towards a narrow stretch of rocky coastline. Steep ravines carved through the terrain, serving as channels for watercourses. Only where these streams cascaded into the ocean did the land flatten, revealing fertile ground suitable for cultivation.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The island was home to a single village, exclusively occupied by soldiers assigned as guards. A naval vessel was stationed there, conducting patrols in the surrounding waters. Approaching or landing on Yarujima without an authorized pass from the emperor or the shogun was strictly forbidden.</p>
<p>Individuals of significant power and high rank who fell out of favor with the government were occasionally banished to Yarujima. By confining them to this island, their movements and actions were closely monitored, denying them an honorable death through hara-kiri . A garrison of bushi warriors stationed on the island ensured the isolation of these exiles.</p>
