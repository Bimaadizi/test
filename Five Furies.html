<p>The so-called Five Furies were a group of five women – assistants and protégés of the Holycoin Voice of the Lady Tharundar Olehm , from the Goldspires temple complex of Waukeen in Athkatla .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Five Furies were known for being beautiful, ambitious, and devote followers of Waukeen's dogma. All five members were clerical sister holding the title of Overgolds within the Church of Waukeen .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Despite being sisters within the religion, the Five Furies played games of intrigue and civil competition for the role of the Holycoin Voice of the Lady's successor.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Halanna Jashire, the youngest of the Five Furies, started experiencing crippling and life-draining visions sent to her by Waukeen. The goddess was considered dead or missing since the Time of Troubles at the time, and the visions informed the Five and Holycoin Olehm of their deity being trapped in Graz'zt 's hellish realm. Holycoin Olehm believed Halanna was favored by Waukeen as the young woman rapidly advanced among the church's ranks to her title of the Overgold, and he put out a word, attracting the attention of brave heroes who would help the imprisoned goddess. The church assembled a group, later referred to as the Rescuers of the Merchant's Friend , who traveled to the Nine Hells and freed Waukeen. Halanna Jashire's visions stopped, and she returned to her priestly activities and intrigues.</p>
<p>With the return of Waukeen to her former glory and the church going through a renaissance, the Five Furies used their skills, including masterful dancing, to convert many of Athkatla 's noble houses to the faith. All five women used their influences, manipulation, and family fortune and status to try and gain in the eyes of Tharundar Olehm. After 1370 DR, Daerea Ethgil manipulated reports from southern branches of the Church of Waukeen to Halanna Jashire's family being involved in church members walking away from the worship.</p>
