<p>Bristar (called Velethuil by its elven inhabitants ) was a village of moon elves in Deepingdale , and one of the largest community of elves in Cormanthor during the late 14 th century DR . They had a strong alliance with the Dalesmen, lending their archers to the dale's militia in their shared fight against the drow .</p>
<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>The name "Bristar" is a contraction of the name "Brightstar". Brightstar was the name of the clan of elves living there. The elven name for the settlement comes from their former leader, Velethuil, who was tragically killed by a forest buffalo when scouting the region to found the village.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The elves of Bristar were particularly protective of Lake Eredruie , a sacred pool of water whose waters had healing properties to elves and half-elves .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the great Retreat of the elves to the island nation of Evermeet , the elves of Bristar that chose to stay on the mainland allied themselves with Deepingdale over the Elven Court â€“aligned settlement of Semberholme . This decision added to the community's strength and prosperity in the wake of an overall decreased elven population.</p>
