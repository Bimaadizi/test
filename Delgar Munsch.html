<p>Delgar Munsch was a hunter at Bridgefort in Boareskyr Bridge around 1368 DR .</p>
<p>He owned a cabin in the area, where Delgar and his company of hunters took their prey, including goblins and orcs , which they later sold at Baldur's Gate . Around 1367 DR , he retired after a very good season but when the crusade of the Shining Lady arrived nearby he joined the crusaders, even becoming an officer.</p>
<p>He was a man with an inflated sense of his own importance but he was a superb hunter.</p>
