<p>Rielev was a tortured experiment captured by the cruel archmage named Jon Irenicus some years before 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Rielev was trapped in a torturous existence within a glass chamber sometime before the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR and kept in Jon Irenicus's Dungeon and laboratory deep underneath the city of Athkatla in Amn . Once, Rielev was a loyal servant to Jon Irenicus. The poor wretch's existence was clouded in oblivion and ambiguity, stuck between life and death. According to their clouded memory, Irenicus was a friend and of the same people as the tortured experiment. Rielev was promised eternal life and youth in reward for their service; until then, Irenicus suspended them in a glass chamber, eventually forgetting or not caring for Rielev's fate. They asked for death and freedom from unending torture. The unfortunate soul's life was fueled by an energy source. Rielev asked Abdel Adrian , who recently escaped Irenicus's clutches, to remove the batteries, thus ending their existence.</p>
