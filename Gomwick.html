<p>Gomwick was killed in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , when delivering a bag of letters to Baldur's Gate . He was slain by a pack of gnolls associated with the Cult of the Absolute that attacked travelers along the Risen Road , and his body remained in the nearby forest. Scratch remained by his side for some time, sure that his friend would wake up soon.</p>
<p>Danzo Arkwright , Gomwick's employer, sent out a carrier pigeon with a warning letter to Gomwick, telling him to be careful as there had been attacks and murders on the roads outside of Baldur's Gate. The letter never reached the courier.</p>
