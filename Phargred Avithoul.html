<p>Phargred Avithoul was a drider and slavemaster of House Avithoul from Sschindylryn during the 1480s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar , Phargred oversaw the operations at the ruined Temple of Mystra in the King's Forest as they sought after the Thread of the Weave , joined by Eldrin Szind and Odezzt Avithoul . Phargred used drow slave collars to control large numbers of slaves captured from Eveningstar , using them as labor and soldiers for the drow as they searched the ruins. He was greatly displeased to find a team of adventurers that had broken into the temple and rescued Ana Brabener along with the other slaves, killing Eldrin and Odezzt in the process. He attempted to bar their way out, accompanied by a large group of slaves, but was overcome and perished in battle.</p>
