<p>Taurus was a proud gladiator and mastermind who fought in the Arena of Hillsfar .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The minotaur was well known around Hillsfar , and involved in a lot of drama. The superb gladiator was renowned for his cruelty and brawn, and fought with his horns, as well as his weapon . He had at least one servant do his bidding.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Taurus fought in the arena circa 1358 DR , and was a high ranked pugilist. He was a friend of Jared Jymn , who went missing that same year. Granite, a dwarf of the Fighter's Guild was commissioned to find Jymn, and worked his way through the arena to fight Taurus. After being questioned mid-fight, Taurus told Granite that he had left a message at Hermit's Place . Taurus followed up with an insult and an attack, but the ferocious Granite slammed the minotaur into the seating area of the stadium, defeating him.</p>
<p>Due to jealousy, Taurus imprisoned the daughter of Diane , a resident of Hillsfar, in a mirror of life trapping . Only an honored mage would be able to break such an enchantment. Mhai Prittee , the mage who was inexperienced in hand-to-hand combat, had already achieved great honor, and thus was tasked with defeating Taurus in an arena duel, a seemingly impossible quest. The duel began, and Mhai did not fair well, being knocked to the ground by Taurus' quarterstaff , and faced certain defeat. However, Mhai's crafty frog pet, Dodo , tripped Taurus up with his huge tongue, giving Mhai the opportunity to knock him out, ending the battle. Prittee then located Taurus' mirror and destroyed it, freeing Diane's daughter.</p>
