<p>Verzen Wranlock was an Inquisitor to the Church of Lady Shar from the town of Reithwin , once a Selûnite settlement in the Western Heartlands , who lived sometime before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Verzen was believed to be a person with an analytical mind and focus, judging by the tight and precise handwriting left behind in the Inquisitor's investigation notes ledger in Reithwin.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Verzen Wranlock died sometime before the fall of Reithwin and its consumption by the Shadow-cursed Lands , before the 1374 DR . In life, Verzen sought and eradicated followers of Lady Shar's much-hated sister Selûne in Reithwin. Wranlock's last investigation sent the Inquisitor on a hunt for a hidden Selûnite resistance cell after the town's complete fall into Shar worship. One of the prisoners in the Moonrise Towers revealed the information on the cell with some help from a thumbscrews torture device. It was revealed to Verzen that there was an abandoned river shore fishing hut where a potter once lived, and the shack was used as a place of worship to Selûne and a gathering place for her faithful. It was unknown if she was successful, but Verzen's dead body ended up on the ruined battlefield on the outskirts of Reithwin, where the army of Sharrans and Harpers clashed in the late 14 th century DR.</p>
