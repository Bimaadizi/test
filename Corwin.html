<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In the late 15th century DR , Corwin was an aged man who was disenchanted because of his life experiences. He lived in a simply furnished bedroom on the upper level of the stable house.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Corwin's employer, Gustaf Stellern, liked to hunt orcs and turn their heads into trophies. Corwin warned him that this could provoke a retaliatory attack and he was proved right. Following the appearance of the white dragon Cryovain in the region, the orcs formed an alliance with a half-orc cult of Talos and attacked the hunting lodge. The anchorites of Talos also conjured Gorthok the Thunder Boar to aid the attack.</p>
