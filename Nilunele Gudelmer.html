<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like her sister, Nilunele Gudelmer was a smart, astute, and charming woman. Among her family, Nilunele was the most adventurous and eager to partake in bold affairs.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR, Nilunele Gudelmer had three siblings, all sisters. Iylandra and Raeveshara Gudelmer were the older siblings, while Quaerthara Gudelmer was Nilunele's younger twin. The sisters lived with their father, Albaerlus, in the family mansion, famously haunted and beautiful Dancing Dolphins House in Athkatla's resplendent Gem District . All four sisters were professional escorts and guides to Athkatla, offering their services to visitors in need of companionship. The Gudelmer sisters were well-known in Athkatla's upper classes through their social status and professional life. Nilunele's natural thrill-seeking personality and devil-may-care attitude often made her the first choice to be hired to wear disguises and aid in various illicit activities.</p>
