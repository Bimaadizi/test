<p>Corga Kazan was a cleric of the old gods in the Oasis of the White Palm. He masqueraded as a water bearer, and was contacted by the efreet Khalitarius in the year 1356Â DR , who wanted him to kidnap the bride of the sheik's son.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The cleric carried an enchanted mace, and in his lair within the Temple of Set, he had access to the Skull of Garath .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Corga Kazan possessed fairly good wisdom.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Corga masqueraded as a water bearer in the oasis, because his faith was officially forbidden. Per Hogan Underwood , Corga was never seen before noon; nonetheless, the water bearer did in fact wander the oasis some.</p>
<p>Corga believed that the bride must have some power over Khalitarius, and that was why the efreet wanted her kidnapped. Nonetheless, he agreed to kidnap the bride for the efreet, making an arrangement with the slavers so they would carry out the deed in exchange for permission to operate freely once Corga took over the oasis. He was convinced they had carried out the deed, but were holding her for a bigger ransom; he also believed that if he was allowed to discover the secret of the bride's power, he could use it to better rule over the oasis. He was certain that the adventurers working for the sheik were actually in league with the slavers.</p>
