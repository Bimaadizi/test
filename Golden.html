<p>Golden was a village in the land of Koryo in Kara-Tur . [ speculation ]</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Long before the 14th century DR , the village of Golden was once besieged by bandits and the villagers were forced to defend themselves. The spiritual guide Ojy was pressed into work as a weaponsmith, though he knew little of metalworking. With every accurate strike of his hammer, he thanked his guiding spirits, and so the stars of Ojy-do were forged from the strength of his faith. He also crafted other weapons, and with his creations, the villagers fought back.</p>
