<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Arkanis and a handful of others were gathered together by the Gatewarden of Candlekeep's to assist Gorion's Ward with a few of the finer points of group dynamics in combat. Together, the group found waves of illusory beasts and monsters that were summoned by the mage Obe .</p>
<p>Some time later, as Candlekeep was being infiltrated by doppelgangers , Arkanis and the halfling thief Deder escaped into the library-fortress' subterranean catacombs. Within, they encountered Gorion's Ward yet again.</p>
