<p>A snake-dog was a magical hybrid of a venomous snake and a dog . It was domesticated by the yuan-ti living in the jungles of Chult .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Snake-dogs were around 2 feet (0.61 meters) tall at the shoulder, with an elongated body and a snake-like tail. Their bodies and necks were both about 4 feet (1.2 meters) long. Their elongated, flattened heads were snake-like, except for their ears of 6 inches (15 centimeters). A snake-dog could unhinge its own jaw to allow it to swallow larger objects than would normally fit and its mouth had rows of sharp fangs. It was covered in snake-like jungle-colored scales, which camouflaged it in a jungle environment.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>The snake-dog was aggressive, but not overly so, and fiercely protective of its own kind, especially females and young. It was able to swim well thanks to its snake-like qualities. It had a venomous bite that it would use in a confrontation, as well as the ability to trip bipeds using its long neck. They could be trained to become effective defensive pets.</p>
<h2>Diet</h2>
<p>Snake-dogs ate small rodents, mammals and vermin. The long neck helped them to capture prey inside burrows.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was not clear whether or not they were true descendants of the dog, but it was likely that they were the creation of a wizard rather than a natural evolution. Some snake-dogs also lived in the Vilhon Reach area, again in yuan-ti company, but they did not survive in city-like environments, as they required moisture and water in which to swim regularly.</p>
