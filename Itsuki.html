<p>Itsuki was a village located in Miyama Province in Kozakura .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The village of Itsuki found itself on the border between the Konjo shoen and the shoen of the samurai Sakai Kazuhiko , sparking a protracted territorial dispute. The village has effectively become a no-man's-land, with both factions setting up militarized zones on either side, making Itsuki the focal point of their conflict.</p>
<p>On the east side, Tu-shun , a formidable sohei from the Konjo shoen, fortified his position with seventy-five sohei and two aides. Opposing him from the west is Sakai Kazuhiko, who has rallied ten samurai, fifty bushi , and three samurai aides around his manor. Caught in the crossfire were the villagers of Itsuki, enduring the brunt of this seemingly endless strife.</p>
<p>Skirmishes between Tu-shun and Sakai's forces were frequent yet lacked the severity that the situation warranted, often devolving into theatrical displays of aggression where insults flew more freely than actual blows. On occasion, combatants mustered the courage for a direct confrontation, resulting in a brief, chaotic melee before the defeated party retreated to lick their wounds.</p>
<p>The ineptitude of both Tu-shun and Sakai as military leaders has inadvertently kept the conflict at a stalemate, with neither side able to secure a decisive advantage. This precarious equilibrium suggested that even a minor shift could dramatically alter the power dynamics within Itsuki.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to the warring leaders, a potential catalyst for change already existed within the village. The beleaguered villagers, weary of the destruction wrought by this ongoing feud, were covertly seeking a champion to deliver them from the cycle of conflict. This quest for a savior could introduce an unforeseen variable into the equation, potentially tipping the scales and reshaping the future of Itsuki.</p>
