<p>Gorothir's Girdle was a holy text of the church of Shar that took the unusual form of a black leather corset instead of an actual book . It was said to be one of the oldest garments in Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Girdle was a black leather corset studded with many small figures carved out of jet . There were a total of 28 figures decorating it, each of them as tall as a small man's palm and sporting empty eye sockets. Those visages were particularly life-like, and were easily recognizable from each other. They were described as follows:</p>
<p>While made to be worn by an individual with a small waist, the laces holding the Girdle together allowed almost anyone to wear it—albeit sometimes in a ridiculous fashion.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This sacred item was protected by enchantments against deliberate attacks and the ravages of time, making it as resistant as bone or ivory . It also benefited from a permanent ironguard spell.</p>
<p>The knowledge contained in the Girdle could be revealed by placing the correct gems in the jet figures' empty eye sockets. When a correct gem was inserted, it would stick in place and glow slightly. When a wrong gem was used it would vanish, consumed by the divine item. Once both gems in a specific figure were matched properly the corresponding spell would appear within that face in midair, in vertical floating letters of green fire. Doing so would not consume the gems, which were safeguarded by the divine relic's protective powers and could only be removed deliberately.</p>
<p>While typical holy books could only be used by faithful of the corresponding deity, Shar allowed the Girdle to be used by priests of any faith—even against her own clergy. On occasions, Shar proved capable of corrupting the possessor of the girdle if they were not her followers already, turning them into faithful servants. She would also take actions if she deemed the current owner of the item to be too weak, whispering to more worthy priests so they could make the girdle their own.</p>
<p>In some cases, the Girdle granted its owner the ability to cast spells once a day such as aberrate , damning darkness , fiendish clarity , and slow consumption . It would also sometimes damages creatures of good alignment that made contact with it.</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>As a spellbook , the Girdle contained information on 28 spells, which were represented by the many visages ornamenting it:</p>
<p>On the inside of the girdle, a tale described how Gorothir felled an empire with only a lie and a secret. This text also contained the specifications of the false sending spell. Some sages believe that this text wasn't originally present on the girdle, but was an addition by a former owner.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Girdle was first used circa −310 DR by Gorothir , the Dark Prophet of the Night, a priest of Shar. While some believed that Gorothir made the item, others thought he received it from the goddess or from one of her servants.</p>
<p>This belt had a bloody history, moving from one owner to the next through murder and deceit. Gorothir lost the belt after being blasted in a conflagration of powerful magic by his descendants. One of those took the belt for himself, only to be assassinated by a fellow clergywoman a couple years later. One particular nameless owner, who displeased Shar, was turned into a staggering undead to watch over the Girdle until a more worthy owner showed up. The belt was lost in the Underdark after a powerful priestess attained lichdom but lost Shar's favor. Its last known owner was Zesstra Aleanrahel , third daughter of a powerful drow matron mother .</p>
