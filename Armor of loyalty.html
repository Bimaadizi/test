<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first accords of armors of loyalty came from a wizard Mekhari , who sometime before the 14 th century DR became targeted by his one bodyguards, charmed by a rival enchanter , wronged by Mekhari. The wizard thought such a waste of hired guards to be expensive, so he set out to find a way of protecting himself without resorting to killing his employees. Subsequently, Mekhari outfitted his men with armors of loyalty . His death still arrived at the hands of his own lieutenant after a heated wage dispute.</p>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR, armors of loyalty could be found in several locations across the Sword Coast , including the city of neverwinter , and town of Highcliff .</p>
