<p>Deathspike , also called the spear of skewering , was a powerful enchanted spear that could easily be used as a javelin .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deathspike was a strong and thick javelin of somewhat primitive design. It was designed for single-handed or throwing use. Its tip was razor sharp.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Deathspike had magical enchantment to its aim. The aptly named spear of skewering itself was able to deal devastating amounts of damage. In normal use, it tripled the harm done to its target, and in case of a critical hit, it was quintupled.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR , Deathspike was in possession of a tribe of lizardfolk led by Malgi Hi . Sometime during the Cult of the Dragon 's occupation of the ruins of Myth Drannor that year, the lizardfolk of that tribe had a violent stand off with a group of orogs that were trying to carve themselves some of the territory of the razed city. The spear of skewering along with some other valuables was left behind after the conflict in the area known as Stillwater Ruins .</p>
