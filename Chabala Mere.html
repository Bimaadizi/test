<p>The Chabala Mere was a body of water in Sildëyuir on top of which sat the Causeway of Stardeep . It was fed by the Chabala River . The water was nearly freezing, and the local star elves weren't sure it had a bottom. When the land-bridge was closed by the magical defenses in Stardeep, the Chabala Mere became covered in mist.</p>
