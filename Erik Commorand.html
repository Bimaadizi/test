<h2>History</h2>
<p>They were a part of the caravan that Raidon Kane joined, perhaps hired as a concession to the rumors of increased activity from the Red Wizards along the River Umber . He helped defend the caravan against one such raid.</p>
<p>Once in Emmech , after Raidon Kane tried to hire them, he turned out to have only money enough for one. Erik agreed to remain in the city, looking for a boat to take them across the Sea of Fallen Stars , waiting for the two tendays that Raidon's money could buy. When Adrik died, he knew that Erik would move on after that time.</p>
