<p>Morgalla , known as Morgalla the Mirthful , was a dwarven entertainer from Earthfast in the Earthfast Mountains . She was an artist specializing in satirical cartoons.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Morgalla was young and beardless. She had brown eyes and russet braids. She was about four feet tall and usually wore simple clothes.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Morgalla was a member of Clan Chistlesmith and the daughter (or "darl") of Olam Chistlesmith and Thendara Spearsinger , a captain of the hearth guard of Earthfast.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Born around 1310 DR , growing up in orc -besieged Earthfast, Morgalla said her mother taught her to fight with a staff almost as soon as she could stand. Morgalla took an apprenticeship in the Chistlesmith trade of woodcarving, but retained an interest in songs and stories, and had a desire for adventure. On the rare occasion the dwarves gathered in the great clan hall for entertainments, Morgalla earned fame for singing, storytelling, and dancing.</p>
<p>Finally, in mid-autumn of the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , the rogue princess Alusair Obarskyr came to the Earthfast Mountains and found Earthfast. Seeing a good cause to fight for, Alusair lent her aid to the defense against orcs and goblins . While there, she impressed the dwarves were own storytelling skill, and Morgalla befriended her.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , the dwarves of Earthfast joined Cormyr 's alliance against the Tuigan Horde . Morgalla accompanied the army and Alusair, becoming a veteran of the Alliance War . Afterward, Morgalla chose not to return to the Earthfast with the other dwarves. She was nearing her fiftieth birthday and expected to choose a mate and raise a family, or "hearth", and little time left for music and adventure. Instead, she journeyed to Cormyr to see Alusair's homeland.</p>
<p>She spent three years in Cormyr, entertaining and trying to earn fame and an apprenticeship to a more experienced bard . However, she found little success as a dwarf bard, and instead became a satirical artist.</p>
<p>In 1364 DR , Morgalla was sent by Vangerdahast, court wizard of Cormyr, to Waterdeep to aid Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun in locating the source of a curse on bardic music. She journeyed with Danilo Thann and Wyn Ashgrove , among others, to the High Forest and back, finally locating the culprit, Iriador Wintermist , in Waterdeep.</p>
