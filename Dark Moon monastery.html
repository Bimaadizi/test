<p>The Dark Moon monastery was one of the headquarters of the Order of the Dark Moon , a monastic order dedicated to the goddess Shar .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The monastery was nested within the Cloud Peaks in West Faer√ªn , near the northern border of Amn .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The temple was carved directly into the stone facade of a mountain in the peaks. A winding path of stairs and carved stone walkway, flanked by four, statue-topped pillars, gave way to the monastery's entrance.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The entrance of the monastery led into a central, column-lined chamber that housed a simple altar dedicated to Shar. Along the wings of the alter were the monks' living quarters, a simple kitchen, and a minor library. A hallway beyond the central altar led to the inner sanctum of he Dark Moon.</p>
<p>Beyond the monastery was a spacious cavern that held numerous cages. Imprisoned within these cages were numerous monsters and creatures, such as wolves , bears , giant spiders , and gibberlings . At the rear of the cave were a pair of magically-altered cages that could only be opened by solving a riddle.</p>
<p>The cave path extended further away from the monastery, to a secluded, mountainside ledge. This area housed a secluded shrine, set at the foot of a massive statue of Shar. The goddess was depicted in shrouded garb, carrying a dagger in each hand, arms crossed over her chest.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The monastery featured a simple layout and plain decor. Dark purple carpets and holy symbols of Shar decorated the inner sanctum.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The monastery served as a recruiting place for new initiates to the Order of the Dark Moon.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>For some time before Era of Upheaval , the temple of the Cloud Peaks was dedicated to Tempus , the god of Battles. Tempus' followers abandoned their post during the Time of Troubles , in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , to join the avatar of their god in Battledale .</p>
<p>Some time later, the Tempuran devotee Jasper Banff returned to the temple, only to find it had been taken over by the monks of the Dark Moon. He was unfortunately captured and imprisoned within the caves behind the monastery.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , the Sun Soul monk Rasaad yn Bashir traveled to the monastery after evading numerous assassination attempts made upon him by the Dark Moon. At the entrance of the temple, he encountered his brother Gamaz , who he believed to have been killed many years earlier in Athkatla .</p>
<p>Rasaad and his allies broke through the temple and defeated many of the Sharran monks. Gamaz and his acolytes attacked Rasaad and his group, but were ultimately defeated. Gamaz apologized to his brother for turning away from the Way of the Sun Soul , but took solace that his death was at his brother's hand.</p>
