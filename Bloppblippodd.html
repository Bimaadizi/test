<p>Bloppblippodd was a kuo-toa cultist living in Sloobludop during the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Bloppblippodd was a bloodthirsty sadist who was absolutely assured that her divine vision would raise her in glory to rule her people.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bloppblippodd lived quietly in the village of Sloobludop on the Darklake , which was ruled by her father Ploopploopeen . Circa 1486 DR , however, she had a vision of a new god named Leemooggoogoon the Deep Father (in truth, the demon lord Demogorgon ) and spread her new religion among the kuo-toa. Soon, she had gathered so many followers to her that her father Ploopploopeen started to make plans to reclaim his position.</p>
<p>To her surprise, her father and his minions came to Leemooggoogoon's temple offering a party of adventurers who had escaped from drow slavers of Velkynvelve as sacrifices to the new god. Bloppblippodd was pleased by her victory over her father and, after sacrificing the duergar Hemeth , she went to sacrifice the adventurers. But then the adventurers and Ploopploopeen and his warriors attacked her and her lieutenantsâ€”all this being part of his plan to infiltrate the temple to cut off the head of her cult. At this point, however, "Leemooggoogoon", along with dozens of ixitxachitl , rose from Darklake and started to destroy Sloobludop, killing all present, including Bloppblippodd and her cultists.</p>
