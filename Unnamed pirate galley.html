<p>The pirate galley , also known as the prison galley , was an unnamed typical Korinn Archipelago galley used by pirates as a slaveship . Its final destination was to be the pirate stronghold Westhaven , but it crashed on Viledel's Isle .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was about 60 feet (18 meters) long, with ten two-man oar benches down each side. As with any galley, it could carry a forty-man compliment of rowers, plus a captain and a steerman . It had a single mast and no forecastle or sterncastle. Its two hatches opened into the holds; the forward hatch opened into the forward hold and the aft hatch opened into a small aft hold. Before the crash, the aft hold held four barrels of wine and ale ; dozens of sacks of grain ; fifty quarrels for Hafkris ' heavy crossbow , which was also stored there; a chest holding the Captain's Log (written in thieves' cant ), navigational charts, and a spellbook containing two spells : magic missile and sleep .</p>
<p>The slave hold ran about two-thirds of the length of the galley, from the bow to about one-third of the way to the stern. A single hatch led to the deck.</p>
<h3>After the crash</h3>
<p>The port side of the galley was laid open by a huge boulder that the vessel had ground against. The sail was furled when the squall hit, and the mast snapped to come crashing down on deck mere minutes before the ship ran aground, blocking the single hold hatch. The barrels broke, spilling wine and ale everywhere; the sacks of grain were rendered useless by sea water and the barrels' content. The chest and its contents remained undamaged, as well as the crossbow and quarrel. If any of the survivors decided to use the wreck as shelter for the day, they would not live to see a new dawn as they would slowly freeze to death.</p>
