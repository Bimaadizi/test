They were the most famous wonder to come from the land of Halruaa .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The original creation of skyships dated back to Netheril and were a secret of Halruaa for centuries. However, in the early 1370s DR , a renegade wizard spread the secret of Halruaan skyships to others.</p>
<h2>Form and function</h2>
<p>Like any ships that sailed on water, skyships required three masts, with square sails in order to navigate laterally with the wind currents. However they also had two or more steering panels that swung out on either side for guidance and a broad, beam for even landing on flat ground. At least ten magical plates, usually made of the shells of Halruaan sea turtles were added to the underside. More plates were needed for larger skyships.</p>
<p>These plates were imbued with the magic that granted the ship flight and were connected to a control rod , made of silver and capped at the ends with gold . These magical components gave the helmsman control of the skyship's vertical movement, allowing the vessel to ascend. The steering panels made it possible to guide its horizontal navigation.</p>
<p>Skyships could sail on water as well as any sea-faring craft and could not be sunk as long as their underlying magic was intact.</p>

<p>A Halruaan skyship was not a spelljammer vessel, but it was possible to convert a Halruaan skyship into one by installing a spelljamming helm .</p>
