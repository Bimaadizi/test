<p>A bolt , sometimes called a quarrel , was a type of ammunition that was fired from a crossbow .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bolts came in various shapes and sizes. They could also be wielded as a melee weapon , but were tiny, and thus didn't do much damage. Bolts came in wooden cases that held ten of them.</p>
<p>Like arrows , some bolts were enchanted in some way so they could deal more damage, dispel , blind , or silence their target. A repeating crossbow could hold five bolts in a clip.</p>
