<p>Ubar , also called the Lost City of Ubar , was a unique city found in Zakhara , the Land of Fate, in 1367 DR .</p>
<p>Ubar was the given name of the city in Jannti , the common genie tongue, but the desert giants referred to the location as Dayya in their own language.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This mystical city was said to rise from the sands of the Genies' Anvil of the High Desert whenever the genies commanded. Other travelers said it was a permanent fixture of the desert.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ubar was ringed with strong stone walls and iron gates. Eight octagonal-shaped towers provided splendid views of the surrounding terrain. Ubar's central market was built around a deep well. All of the buildings in Ubar were large enough to accommodate giants , prompting the logical conclusion that it was originally constructed by desert giants.</p>
<p>Because of the Amir's poor health, and lack of leadership to direct routine maintenance, many of the buildings in Ubar were in need of repair.</p>
<p>The Amir's palace, the Red Tower of Dayya , was located in the center of the city.</p>
<p>Mosques to Hajama , Najm , and Haku could be found within Ubar.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Perhaps in an attempt to win back a location that was originally theirs, desert giants raided Ubar frequently.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Ubar was populated by an astonishing 200,000 jann , though many of them only visited periodically while wandering the desert. Any janni within the city was not required to answer the call of a sha'ir .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Ubar fielded 2,000 soldiers to guard the city. Many of these soldiers were camel lancers and archers.</p>
