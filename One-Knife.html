<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Spur, 1348 DR , the Hunter's Hollow, where the Way of the Dragon crossed the King's Forest, between the towns of Espar and Tyrluk , became a site of the deadly ambush. The bandits, in reality, assassins sent to murder King Azoun Obarskyr IV and make it looks like a simple mugging, strong onto the monarch of Cormyr and a small group of his loyal Purple Dragons . Unbeknownst to the King nor the assassins, the Hunter's Hollow was a meeting spot of Irlgar Delbossan , his men, sent to secure transportation of a scion of the Crownsilver family, and Florin Falconhand , who tried to teach the said scion manners and the way of life in the realms. Said Scion, Narantha Crownsilver , along with Florin Falconhand, walked into the ambush and joined the battle. One-Knife was among the assassins who attacked both the ranger and the young Crownsilver noble, but with the duo working together, One-Knife was slain. Subsequently, with the help of unexpected participants, the Battle of Hunter's Hollow was won and the King's life was saved.</p>
