<p>Imryll Elusarshee , also known as the Deeping Princess , was the half-elf founder of Deepingdale . She envisioned a land where human , elves , and half-elves could join in a common society focused on the elven lore and ways of living in Cormanthor , without destroying the deep forest.</p>
<p>Considering the state of the dale following the Retreat , with the strongly aligned communities of humans and elves, this vision and her legacy were a success.</p>
