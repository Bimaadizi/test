<p>Tatterdemanimals were a variation of raggamoffyn composed of small dirty scraps of cloth. They were the least dangerous form of raggamoffyn.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>All raggamoffyns attempted to envelop potential victims in order to control them. If successful, the parts of the raggamoffyn clung to the victim in a skin-tight sheath from head to toe. The raggamoffyn usually created a hood to cover the victim's face as well. Once enveloped, a victim was forced to do the raggamoffyn's bidding until the creature was done with them or they were able to resist the creature's control.</p>
<p>Tatterdemanimals were only able to attach to small or tiny targets, usually going for rats , cats , pigs , birds , and small dogs .</p>
<p>These creatures were immune to blunt weapons, but were particularly susceptible to fire-based attacks.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Tatterdemanimals often gathered together in small groups, controlling packs of small animals.</p>
