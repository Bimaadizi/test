<p>Jarlaxle ( pronounced : / dʒ ɑːr ˈ l æ ks ʊl / jar-LÆX-ul ) was a drow mercenary and leader of the Bregan D'aerthe mercenary company. He was one of a small number of male drow who actually had significant power in a Lolth -worshiping city, although he increasingly spent little time in the city itself as he adventured on the surface .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Slender, handsome, and tightly muscled, Jarlaxle was the dandy of Menzoberranzan .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>More than anything, Jarlaxle was an opportunist. His wealth was considerable, but official station in drow society meant nothing to him. He observed that the best way for a male to survive and prosper in the matriarchal drow society was to be outside the system and to be too valuable to be eliminated—and he was audacious enough to take his life in that direction. Always calm and graceful, Jarlaxle enjoyed flaunting his independence and was proud of the fact that the noble houses came to him for aid. In the city of Menzoberranzan, intrigue and double-dealing were a way of life, and no one played them better than Jarlaxle did.</p>
<p>As a male outsider who had no qualms dealing with the "lesser races", Jarlaxle had much information few others beyond Lolth's priestesses were likely to have access to. He was one of the most powerful males, if not individuals, in the city and the surrounding Underdark. He benefited from the chaos of Menzoberranzan and was always able to align himself with the winning side in any conflict. In his earlier years, he thrived on the internal politics of Menzoberranzan, but they had always disturbed him. In his later years, he preferred to see adventure and profit in the World Above. Once he escaped the "wretched hole in the ground," he did not want to return. He found that he felt most alive when he was with friends and when he was taking risks. He had an "insatiable curiosity and a desire to know—everything." This curiosity made him antsy when he remained stuck in one place too long and drove his quest for personal exploration.</p>
<p>He had a very charismatic personality, always willing to talk his way out of situations rather than resort to force of arms. Moreover, talking was what Jarlaxle did best. His words easily worked past the handicap of his race's evil reputation, able to turn potential enemies into allies. He loved irony, sarcasm, and wit. He was extremely intelligent and a brilliant tactician who was always prepared for any imaginable or unimaginable circumstances. Jarlaxle's lieutenant Kimmuriel Oblodra revealed a deep understanding of Jarlaxle's personality, recognizing that his gambling and sometimes foolish-seeming attitude was a very good façade, underneath which lay a frighteningly intelligent mind.</p>
<p>Jarlaxle preferred to avoid killing someone as long as that person could be manipulated to serve his interests, no matter how small his or her role might be. In fact, Jarlaxle didn't like to kill somebody unless he had to, an unusual trait in a drow—and likely the reason he did so in the first place. Several times, he played the hero just for the sake of it.</p>
<p>Jarlaxle was also flirtatious. He had no qualms about flirting with (and sleeping with) dragons.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early Life</h3>
<p>Jarlaxle was born to Yvonnel Baenre , the matron mother of House Baenre , the first house of Menzoberranzan. Due to the status of his birth order, Jarlaxle was to be sacrificed to Lolth . However, the sacrificial blade of Matron Baenre could not pierce the infant. Her second-oldest son, Doquaio Baenre , was ordered to assist, but as he grabbed the infant, all of the kinetic energy of the attempted sacrifice was reflected on to him through the psionic power of the matron mother of House Oblodra . Doquaio was killed instead. The failure of the sacrifice was kept secret, but Matron Baenre feared Jarlaxle from that time forward and believed that her fate was tied with his, while Jarlaxle was viewed as favored by the Spider Queen. Indeed, Lolth did favor him as an agent of chaos and granted him the memory of his near-sacrifice. However, he rejected her and she withdrew her favor, although the matron mothers of Menzoberranzan never learned of that fact. Kimmuriel Oblodra was one of only three living drow who knew the truth of the story; the event and involvement of Matron Oblodra was apparently passed down through the years among the members of House Oblodra.</p>
<p>Jarlaxle attended Melee-Magthere , the warriors' academy. He was recognized for his mastery of strategy and tactics and his strength was in the non-physical aspects of fighting, although he was a skilled swordsman as well. However, he favored a stealthy dagger over hand-to-hand combat.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Dracorage, 1018 DR , Jarlaxle got to know Zaknafein Do'Urden , later the father of Drizzt Do'Urden . They became close friends in time, but he eventually betrayed Zaknafein in undisclosed circumstances and still felt guilty over it many years later.</p>
<h3>Bregan D'aerthe</h3>
<p>Jarlaxle later left his house and his name (but not his connections) behind and founded Bregan D'aerthe , a mercenary band of rogue males that grew to be very powerful. It could be said that the band forged its own underworld empire in Menzoberranzan. Bregan D'aerthe was present among the troops of Baenre during the fall of House Do'Urden .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Jarlaxle worked with Artemis Entreri during the early phases of Baenre's attempted conquest of Mithral Hall . Entreri had requested a fight against Drizzt Do'Urden—a fair one—and offered his services in return. However, a fair fight was not, at the time, able to be given. Entreri "joined" Bregan D'aerthe and was led to Menzoberranzan, but there he felt trapped and fled the Underdark (with Jarlaxle's implicit aid) with Drizzt and Catti-brie.</p>
<p>Jarlaxle arranged another fight between Entreri and Drizzt Do'Urden in the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR . During the fight, he acquired Crenshinibon . At this time, Jarlaxle approached Entreri with the hopes of extending his empire to the surface, starting with Calimport . In the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR , they created a faction out of the Basadoni guild and placed Entreri as its pasha . Jarlaxle increasingly fell under the influence of Crenshinibon until his two lieutenants, Kimmuriel and Rai-guy Bondalek , enacted a plot to overthrow him. He was only rescued from his own follies by Entreri, who claimed to need Jarlaxle alive to protect him from the two drow lieutenants. Jarlaxle made an agreement with Kimmuriel for co-leadership of Bregan D'aerthe while Jarlaxle went traveling around the surface.</p>
<p>By 1490 DR , Artemis Entreri was considered Jarlaxle’s second-in-command and Kimmuriel remained as joint leader alongside Jarlaxle.</p>
<h3>Bloodstone Lands</h3>
<p>After leaving Calimport, Jarlaxle and Entreri eventually wound up working in the Bloodstone Lands (namely Damara and Vaasa ) in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR . He and Entreri started working for Ilnezhara and Tazmikella , the copper dragon sisters in Heliogabalus , who wanted them to investigate the appearance of Zhengyian constructs in Vaasa . They joined a party of adventurers, battled the dracolich Urshula , and invaded a replica fortress of Castle Perilous . Jarlaxle disappeared during the fight, drawing Entreri's mistrust, but Jarlaxle appeared and claimed the castle for "King Artemis I of the Kingdom of D'aerthe ". In Damara, Jarlaxle obtained Idalia's flute and gave it to Entreri in an apparent attempt to help him resolve his emotional problems. Instead, the flute brought up all sorts of memories, leading Artemis back to Calimshan to search for (and murder) his father. He refused to travel with Jarlaxle further after that point. However, Athrogate remained by Jarlaxle's side.</p>
<h3>Later Travels</h3>
<p>During his travels with Artemis, Jarlaxle stayed in regular contact with his lieutenant Kimmuriel, in whose capable hands he left Bregan D'aerthe. Although he did not at the time take an active role in leading his mercenaries, he still requested the resources of the group when it suited his needs. The option was open for Jarlaxle to retake control of the mercenaries, as Kimmuriel wished to be done with his duties leading the group so that he could spend more time with matters of the mind.</p>
<p>At some point after they split ways, Jarlaxle was forced, against his will, to betray Artemis in Baldur's Gate to the Netherese , who were seeking to recover the Charon's Claw sword. To refuse to aid the Netherese would have resulted in war between the Empire of Netheril and Menzoberranzan and possibly in Jarlaxle's own execution. Jarlaxle trapped Entreri in one of his extra-dimensional pockets, originally planning to rescue his human friend immediately after handing him over. However, Kimmuriel Oblodra and House Baenre had worked to lower Jarlaxle's magical defenses so that Kimmuriel could enter his mind and change his memories about the betrayal. He instead came to believe that Entreri had betrayed him. By the time Jarlaxle had found out the truth, Entreri was beyond Jarlaxle's reach, and Matron Mother Quenthel Baenre had forbidden Jarlaxle from involving himself in the affair further. Jarlaxle and Athrogate went on numerous adventures together over the next several decades but always did Jarlaxle regret what had happened to his old friend.</p>
<p>Over 1376 to 1377 DR , Jarlaxle and Bregan D'aerthe manipulated events in Luskan that resulted in the destruction of the Host Tower of the Arcane , the death of Deudermont , and Luskan becoming a free port. Jarlaxle allowed Regis and Drizzt to live and also took a scrimshaw piece from Regis that depicted Drizzt and Guenhwyvar , rather than taking the valuable ruby pendant .</p>
<p>In the Year of Three Streams Blooded, 1384 DR , Jarlaxle's dreams were invaded by Yharaskrik , an illithid killed years before, who had joined up with Hephaestus , the red dragon Jarlaxle had helped kill, and the lich kings captured in Crenshinibon , creating the Ghost King . He and Athrogate both joined up with Drizzt Do'Urden, Bruenor Battlehammer, and Thibbledorf Pwent on an adventure to Spirit Soaring , where they hoped Cadderly Bonaduce could help them fend off the coming of the Ghost King. They succeeded in that task, albeit not in the manner they had expected.</p>
<p>After Catti-brie wandered off, Drizzt and Bruenor asked Jarlaxle to try to find her. He searched "half the Realms" to no avail.</p>
<h3>Gauntlgrym</h3>
<p>In the Year of Knowledge Unearthed, 1451 DR , Jarlaxle and Athrogate joined Dahlia Sin'felle in an expedition to Gauntlgrym , where they were tricked into releasing the fire primordial that destroyed the city of Neverwinter . In the Year of the Elves' Weeping, 1462 DR , Jarlaxle, Athrogate, and Dahlia once again joined together and recruited Drizzt Do'Urden and Bruenor Battlehammer in an attempt to right this wrong. They were successful, but in the process Bruenor was killed and Jarlaxle and Athrogate were overtaken by fire. Drizzt (falsely) presumed the latter two dead.</p>
<p>However, in reality, Jarlaxle had not died in Gauntlgrym. Some time later, he discovered that Drizzt, Dahlia, and their companions had been captured by the Netherese lord Draygo Quick and were being held in his home. With the help of Bregan D'aerthe and his brother Gromph Baenre , he assaulted the castle to free Drizzt and company. Artemis Entreri had also been traveling with Drizzt at the time and Jarlaxle ensured that his petrified form was returned to flesh, although it was clear that Artemis did not forgive Jarlaxle for his betrayal. Drizzt disappeared in Icewind Dale not long afterwards, and Jarlaxle, despite many expensive attempts, was unable to locate him.</p>
<h3>In Luskan</h3>
<p>When the reincarnated Regis passed through Luskan in the Year of the Awakened Sleepers, 1484 DR , he stayed at One-Eyed Jax , an inn and tavern on the northern bank that was named for and owned by Jarlaxle (through Ship Kurth ). The barkeep, Serena , was "spoken for" by Jarlaxle, who was well-known by the tavern's patrons. Jarlaxle had a conversation with Regis, and while the drow didn't recognize the halfling , he was suspicious enough to send a Bregan D'aerthe agent to keep an eye on him in Icewind Dale . That agent, Braelin Janquay , discovered Regis's true identity, saving him and Catti-brie from some thugs from Ship Rethnor and presumably passing word of Regis's true identity to Jarlaxle.</p>
<h3>Return to Menzoberranzan</h3>
<p>In the Year of the Awakened Sleepers, 1484 DR , Jarlaxle was summoned back to Menzoberranzan by First Matron Mother Quenthel Baenre in order to serve as Captain of the Guard for the restored House Do'Urden (and to keep him away from Drizzt Do'Urden). However, he bribed Gromph Baenre by arranging psionics lessons for him from Kimmuriel Oblodra in exchange for Gromph allowing Jarlaxle to leave the city. Jarlaxle subsequently learned about the return of Drizzt and the reborn Companions of the Hall and traveled to Damara to recruit the dragon sisters Tazmikella and Ilnezhara, as well as Afafrenfere and Ambergris , to aid him in his interference in the Silver Marches against Quenthel's plans.</p>
<h3>Host Tower of The Arcane</h3>
<p>In 1487 DR, Jarlaxle aided Gromph Baenre and the Companions of the Hall in the reconstruction of the Host Tower of the Arcane. His control over Luskan aided in transportation of goods and workers to the site.</p>
<h3>Return of Zaknafein</h3>
<p>Zaknafein's return to his son Drizzt in the Year of Dwarvenkind Reborn, 1488 DR , was a shock and a welcome surprise to Jarlaxle. He was happy to have one of his oldest friends returned, but was unsure how this has occurred. Jarlaxle reunited with father and son in Longsaddle .</p>
<p>Some time later, drow forces led by Matron Zhindia Melarn and an army of demons continued Zhindia's quest to capture and kill Zaknafein and Drizzt.</p>
<p>Having reassurance from two of Lolth's handmaidens that her quest would prove she was the most faithful priestess in the demon goddess' eyes, Matron Zhindia committed House Melarn to the defense of Gauntlgrym as the demon army bore down upon it. Jarlaxle remained in Gauntlgrym and helped the dwarves and halflings within defend the complex.</p>
<h3>Discovery of Aevendrow</h3>
<p>In the Year of the Star Walker's Return, 1490 DR , Jarlaxle found in the far north region of Faerûn the hidden city Callidae , which was home to the aevendrow , a race of drow, who hadn't followed in the steps of the Spider Queen, but retained their original virtues, and their society was opposite to that of the udadrow society of Menzoberranzan. In Callidae, the company met the aevendrow and became close with a few of them: Galathae , a paladin; Azzudonna and Vessi , warriors; and Ilina , a priestess. From here on, their troubles and adventures began. They included an army of slaadi , frost giants , cante, n'divi, and wyrms eating heat crystals that might lead to the destruction of the whole city.</p>
<p>When Jarlaxle left Callidae for the first time, he agreed to have his memory wiped by a long ceremony performed by thirty priests. However, he had secretly marked a code under his foot as a clue to himself. When he returned to Longsaddle , it became clear that any arcane and psionic attempts to restore his memory would not work. Only an intense intrusion performed by a hive mind could restore Jarlaxle's lost memories. While the illithid intrusion was considered to be deeply traumatic, Jarlaxle came out unharmed. Instead, the mind flayers who took part in the ritual were affected by the mind of Jarlaxle and they started to communicate with more passion and a sense of humor.</p>
<p>Jarlaxle could re-visit and leave Callidae without needing to partake in any further rituals or magical geas . He maintained the secrecy of the location and existence of Callidae. Jarlaxle considered Callidae the realization of his dreams for the drow and further confirmation that Lolth had corrupted the Udadrow.</p>
<h3>Menzoberranzan Civil War</h3>
<p>In Menzoberranzan, there was speculation about which side Bregan D'aerthe and Jarlaxle would choose in the war, with rumors in the Stenchstreets that he would join the heretics' side. Meanwhile, Jarlaxle traveled with Drizzt, Kimmuriel, Dab'nay Tr'arach , and members of Bregan D'aerthe to Menzoberranzan, where they ambushed drow ambushers and took prisoners. When in Menzoberranzan, during an ambush at the Oozing Myconid , Azleah , a Bregan D'aerthe agent, attempted and failed to assassinate Jarlaxle during the skirmish. Jarlaxle later traveled with Dab'nay, Kimmuriel, and Drizzt to rescue the captured Braelin Janquay from House Del'Armgo .</p>
<p>In the resulting fight at House Del'Armgo, Jarlaxle lost his friend and co-leader Kimmuriel, who was trapped and destroyed by his own kinetic barrier . However, Jarlaxle gained the scepter of House Del'Armgo after Matron Mez'Barris 's death. and important hostages along with saving Braelin.</p>
<p>Jarlaxle negotiated ending of the siege of House Baenre with his sister Sos'Umptu . She agreed that those who wanted to leave Menzoberranzan could but would never be allowed to return. Those who remained at House Baenre were given mercy if they served her and Lolth once more. Jarlaxle left Menzoberrazan with approximately 2,000 refugees freed from Lolth. After the civil war, Jarlaxle became the singular leader of Bregan D'aerthe though he could contact Kimmuriel's spirit on rare occasions with the risk of it being their last communication.</p>
<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>Jarlaxle was extremely skilled in the two long blades fighting style commonly used by the drow, though when mismatched with less skilled opponents he was known to use the less effective but visually more showy swashbuckling style to distract them. His mastery of this style was enough to impress even Artemis Entreri, who generally found the style ineffective.</p>
<p>When forced into combat, Jarlaxle could throw a seemingly unlimited supply of magical daggers conferred to him by his bracers; only one of every three were real, the rest were illusions. Of course, Jarlaxle also possessed the typical drow weapon: a hand crossbow adorned with bolts dipped in sleeping poison .</p>
<p>Jarlaxle was talented with languages. He spoke Common perfectly fluently, as well as his native Drow , Abyssal , Goblin , Svirfneblin , and Halfling tongues.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Jarlaxle was very fond of magical items and was renowned for having a seemingly unlimited supply of magical tricks. He was rarely seen with the same item more than once or twice. The following list contains merely some of his confirmed items.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h3>Kimmuriel Oblodra</h3>
<p>Jarlaxle rescued Kimmuriel Oblodra from the fall of his house and made him into a lieutenant of Bregan D'aerthe. He and Kimmuriel shared a mutually beneficial relationship, and Jarlaxle passed on the bulk of the leadership of his band to Kimmuriel in 1366 DR when he ran off with Artemis Entreri. Originally, the arrangement was intended to be temporary, but Jarlaxle increasingly left the running of his band to Kimmuriel, who by 1463 DR was widely understood as the primary leader. Jarlaxle continued to work for Bregan D'aerthe, but he had his own interests and often found himself paying for the band's services.</p>
<h3>Catti-brie</h3>
<p>From their meeting in the Underdark, Jarlaxle showed an attraction to and fondness of Catti-brie . He chose to aid Catti-brie after she was afflicted by the Spellplague , and he even continued to search for her at Drizzt Do'Urden's request.</p>
<h3>Artemis Entreri</h3>
<p>The relationship between Jarlaxle and Artemis Entreri was often strained, but the two traveled together for many years and seemed to have develop some form of friendship—perhaps more so from Jarlaxle's perspective. Jarlaxle and Artemis met when Vierna Do'Urden employed Artemis to help find, capture, and fight against Drizzt Do'Urden. In Calimport, Artemis rescued Jarlaxle—claiming he needed the drow for protection—and escaped the wrath of Rai-Guy and Kimmuriel during the Bregan D'aerthe takeover.</p>
<p>Jarlaxle's treatment of Artemis during their adventures was somewhat bewildering. Jarlaxle's intentions in giving Artemis Idalia's flute were to free him from his emotional burdens to help him enjoy life. However, Artemis saw it as blatant manipulation of his psyche and in some ways a betrayal of their friendship. Idalia's flute was one of the main reasons Artemis left Jarlaxle.</p>
<p>Jarlaxle later betrayed Entreri to the Netherese, for which Entreri never forgave him. Jarlaxle, for his part, had intended to rescue Entreri but was tricked by his fellow drow into forgetting the whole event. Jarlaxle greatly regretted the way events had turned out and it haunted him for many decades.</p>
<h3>Drizzt Do'Urden</h3>
<p>Drizzt Do'Urden originally viewed Jarlaxle (rightfully) with a healthy dose of distrust. He was never quite sure of the mercenary's motivations. However, Jarlaxle claimed to have been a friend of Drizzt's father, and Drizzt came to believe it. Jarlaxle saved Drizzt's life a number of times, and after Drizzt's wife left Toril , Drizzt tasked Jarlaxle with finding her again. (He tried but was not successful.) By 1462 DR , the two considered each other friends.</p>
<p>Jarlaxle was particularly interested in Drizzt because, in Jarlaxle's words, "He was the one who escaped" the heritage and fate of the drow. In Menzoberranzan, Drizzt was a symbol of male rebellion and the lack of acceptance of males' positions among females. Jarlaxle, who always felt there was something wrong with Menzoberranzan and drow society, truly admired him, though he feared that Drizzt was forgetting his principles. Many years after Catti-brie's death, however, Jarlaxle worried that Drizzt was forgetting himself and crossing the line of honor he had always held himself to.</p>
<h3>Athrogate</h3>
<p>Athrogate joined with Jarlaxle in Damara in 1368 DR and traveled with him for many, many years. Jarlaxle came to consider Athrogate his closest friend, and vice-versa. At Jarlaxle's request, Athrogate traveled to Nesme in 1484 DR to join up with the reunited Companions of the Hall .</p>
<h3>Tazmikella and Ilnezhara</h3>
<p>Jarlaxle had a "flirtatious" relationship with the two dragon sisters of Heliogabalus , Tazmikella and Ilnezhara . He flirted with them; Ilnezhara in particular found him very charming. He informed the king about their true identity as dragons then infiltrated their shops as a street waif. He claimed to "know" they wouldn't kill him and to "hope" they would reward him for his interference.</p>
