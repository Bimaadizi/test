<h2>History</h2>
<p>Pellon Kay was born and raised in the country of Sembia to a family full of gifted musicians. However, growing up he never took his performances seriously. The personality he developed led Pellon to accrue a great deal of enemies, numbering in the dozens. Many sages theorized that the goddess of music Milil frowned upon his behavior, but that the god of destruction Talos found it to be quite amusing.</p>
<p>An avatar of Talos was said to have one night stood in a tavern and watch as Pellon started a fight with over twenty men. As he laid on the ground unconscious, Telos sought to reward him for his efforts in spreading such destruction. Telos placed his hands upon Pellon's lute and he discovered the next time he played it that the instrument had been enchanted , allowing him to to drive men into a berserker frenzy just by playing in their direction. An effect similar to the spell dire charm .</p>
<p>For the next several weeks that followed, Pellon took great delight in sparking fights between mercenaries and sailors. Eventually, an unknown warrior with a grim expression on his face murdered Pellon with a crossbow before he could get close enough to use his lute. Afterwards, the warrior threw his enchanted lute into the Sea of Fallen Stars . Eventually, this lute ended up in the hands of the elven merchant Lehland of the Hand of Seldarine . Following his transformation into a ghost , Lehland was still looking for a prospective buyer by 1281 DR .</p>
