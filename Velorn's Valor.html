<p>Velorn's Valor was a small town in Turmish that accepted refugees from across the country â€“ Morningstar Hollows , after Alaoreum River turned their home into uninhabitable bog.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>By the late-14 th century DR , Velorn's Valor was a market-town that catered to cattle ranchers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Like so many other Turami settlements, Velorn's Valor was named after a hero of antiquity. Velorn valorously stood against orcish warbands that threatened Turmish. Velorn's heroics were remembered fondly, and his battered, reportedly authentic shield was proudly displayed on a wall of the town's council hall.</p>
<p>Velorn's shield became the talk of the town in the late-14 th century DR when it was discovered that its backside contained a portable hole . A mysterious treasure map was fished out from the hole . The city council immodestly became absorbed by debates on what to do with the map. The council kept the location of the map a secret, and the shield's portable hole was kept away from prying eyes.</p>
