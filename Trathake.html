<p>Trathake was a food item available in Khôltar , south Faerûn , circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Trathake was a popular food in busy Khôltar because it could be purchased quickly at a blurdren (local food counter) and eaten while walking or working. The basic dish was a bread bun partially hollowed out and filled with meat, then sealed with melted cheese (usually spiced with pepper). One of the worst examples of trathake cost 2 copper pieces each at Mother Talasko's where they used the fried guts of various animals on the hoof for the "meat". Better quality versions at other establishments generally cost a copper or two more.</p>
