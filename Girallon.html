<p>Girallons were aggressive, carnivorous apes with four arms. They were incredibly strong and territorial.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>An adult girallon was about 8 feet (240 centimeters) tall and weighed 800 pounds (360 kilograms). It appeared to be a four-armed ape with thick white fur and curved tusks in its mouth, distinguishing it from normal apes.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>These beasts lived in groups led by a dominant adult, who tended to be the oldest of the group.</p>
<h3>Uses</h3>
<p>Some primitive tribespeople were known to capture young girallons to raise them to be mounts, using many of the same techniques one would use to train an owlbear .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , an unusually old and massive girallon known as the Great Ape was terrorizing Port Nyanzaru in Chult. The massive beast had tough scarred white hide and unprecedented aggression. A group of heroes was tasked with slaying the beast by Jessamine , a Merchant Prince of Port Nyanzaru.</p>
