<p>The Temple of Helm in Bezantur was the largest temple dedicated to Helm in all of Thay . As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , the temple saw itself as a speck of lawfulness amidst the chaos of Beznatur.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple was located in south-central Bezantur, the so-called "City of a Thousand Temples." Appropriately, it was surrounded by other temples, namely the Temple of Shar to the southwest, the Temple of Auril to the south, the Temple of Lliira to the east, the Temple of Oghma to the northeast, and Ilmater's Cathedral to the north.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The temple was likened to a small citadel.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to the Time of Troubles , worship of Helm was frowned upon but mostly permitted within Thay, and he was worshiped by soldiers, mercenaries, tax-collectors, and folk from elsewhere along the Inner Sea . However, his worship declined precipitously following the Time of Troubles when the people of Thay saw him as responsible for the deaths of Bane , Bhaal , and Myrkul â€”all of whom had been popular gods . As a result, the temple in Bezantur was occasionally defaced with offal and graffiti, and its priests were the targets of constant verbal and even physical abuse.</p>
<p>While the temple still stood as of the late 1360s DR, no one in Bezantur worshiped Helm save for the six warrior-priests who stubbornly maintained the building. By that time, they had decided not to abandon the City of a Thousand Temples as to do so would mean admitting that their god had lost much of his influence.</p>
