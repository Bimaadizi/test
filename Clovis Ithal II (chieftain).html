<p>Clovis Ithal II was a chieftain of Clan Ithal during the First Age of Tethyr .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Clovis Ithal II was the grandson of Mong Ithal , the founder of Ithmong . Clovis was the father of Darrom Ithal , who would become the country's first king, and Corin Ithal , who would continue to serve as chief of the clan. Each was the son of a different woman.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Loss, −230 DR , Calimshan changed its stance on newly independent Tethyr and marched on the towns of Ithmong and Myratma , retaking them for Calimshan. They remained in enemy hands for nine years.</p>
<p>During this time, Chief Clovis and his son Darrom formed an alliance with Selanlar , leader of one of the tribes of elves in the Forest of Tethir . Working together for six months, Clan Ithal, six other Tethyrian tribes, and the elves formed an army to retake Ithmong from the Calishites.</p>
<p>During the battle known as the Ithmong Slaughter , Clovis was slain during the charge against the town, being struck with numerous arrows. His son Darrom, however, though only sixteen years old at the time, picked up his father's sword and flag and continued the charge. Darrom and the alliance of elves and men were successful, and they did not leave a single enemy survivor within two miles of the town. The heads of the slain were mounted on spears and displayed south of the town as a warning to Calimshan in what would be called the Plains of Clovis .</p>
