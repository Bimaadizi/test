<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time during the 1360s DR , Saladrex made his lair within the 4 th level of the Watcher's Keep . He was summoned to the keep by the "Lord of the Level" Carston , by means of the Machine of Lum the Mad .</p>
<p>Saladrex remained within the keep because of the amusement he found in Carston's antics. He was particularly delighted by the endless battle fought by the githyanki and illithids who each had encampments nearby.</p>
