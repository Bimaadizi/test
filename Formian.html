<p>Formians ( pronounced : /ˈ f ɔːr m i ʌ n z / FOR-mee-unz ) also known as "Ant-Centaurs" were an ant-like race of outsiders .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Formians were brown and resembled a cross between an ant and a centaur . Their size and appearance otherwise depended on the rank they were born into:</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Formians were dedicated to spreading their colonies wherever they could. Colonies, also called "hive-cities," consisted of a ruling queen and different hierarchies of workers, from worker (lowest) to taskmaskers, from warriors to myrmarchs (highest below the queen). Formians had a hive mind based on the queen; any formian within 50 mi (80 km) of a queen could communicate telepathically with any other formian within that range. The most prestigious of myrmarchs was responsible for guarding the queen. These colonies are prevalant throughout both Mechanus and Arcadia</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Colonies relied on their warriors' fighting abilities to defend the hive. Myrmarchs and taskmasters were also proficient fighters and had limited spell-like abilities, such as dominate monster or charm monster .</p>
<p>The queen had no ability to move, but she could cast spells in defense of her hive and had a number of spell-like abilities, such as charm monster , hold monster , shield of law , and true seeing .</p>
