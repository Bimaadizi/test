<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Blue Lady was a sirine that was transmuted by the Spellplague. Twisted, she resided in Tohrepur . There, prior to 1473 DR , she transformed the farmer Khault , who was fleeing from his destroyed village, into an aberration and he gathered a cult around her.</p>
<p>In 1479 DR , Khault sent members to Airspur to recruit. The Choir kidnapped several residents of Airspur, including the twin sister of a genasi named Ghaelya who the cult believed to be a prophetess. With the help of Uthalion and a few of his friends, Ghaelya traveled to Tohrepur, where one of her friends killed Khault and destroyed the Blue Lady.</p>
