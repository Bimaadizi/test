<p>The Underchasm was a huge canyon created by the Spellplague in 1385 DR that ran roughly north to south from Akan√ªl to the borders of Halruaa . The chasm extended all the way to the Underdark . The upper Underchasm was home to many flying monsters such as dragons . During the Second Sundering in 1486 DR . the quest of the four chosen ( Kleef Kenric , Malik el Sami , Joelle Emmeline and Arietta Seasilver ) to deliver the Eye of Gruumsh to Grumbar for Luthic and to stop Shar restored the canyon to its former earthly land before the Spellplague.</p>
