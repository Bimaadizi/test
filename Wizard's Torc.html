<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Wizard's Torc was a piece of jewelry that consisted of two parts. The first was a large neck ring. The ring was decorated with a starstone .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Wizard's Torc granted the wielder the power to teleport from the Circle of Ualair into a circular room at the beginning of the Elven Catacombs. The bearer of the Wizard's Torc was directly transported to the Catacombs' First Cellar.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It is unknown what happened to the Wizard's Torc after Myth Drannor was destroyed at the end of the Weeping War . Some claim that Ualair broke apart the Wizard's Torc separating the frame and the starstone to seal the passage. Either way, part of the magical item came into the possession of Preybelish , a dark naga , who took up residence behind a magical door in the Dwarven Dungeons under the ruins of the elven city.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , a group of adventurers captured the broken torc from Preybelish and got a starstone to complete the Wizard's Torc from Harldain Ironbar , a city engineer of Myth Drannor and the leader of the dwarves of Onaglym , the House of Gems.</p>
