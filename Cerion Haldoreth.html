<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the Siege of Neverwinter , in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Cerion went to the Neverwinter Guard post in the Tower District and met with Captain Janros to offer the services of elf archers in defending the district against the occupying Many-Arrows orcs , as the land had once been part of Illefarn . He recruited an elf adventurer working with the Guard to place magical beacons in the district to guide the elf archers. He then had the adventurer slay orc sappers tunneling under the city.</p>
