<p>Tsagang was a city in Tabot .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It stood in northern Tabot, just south of the Kun-Yen Shan , between the forests and river there. A road ran west to Shentsa .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When soldiers of Shou Lung invaded Tabot in Shou Year 646 (−604 DR) , the priests and the barbarians were forced to ally against them. Led by the great sohei Ramara and Baron Ohn of Han Chao , they repelled the Shou in the Battle of Tsagang .</p>
<p>Afterward, Ohn and Ramara negotiated for ten days and established the Peace Land Treaty between the tribes and the monks. It legitimized the monks' hermitages (now mountain keeps) and gave them a role in the defense of the lowland tribes and thereby cemented land and peace. Together, they founded a new city—Tsagang—at the place of their victory and founded the new nation of Tabot. All present blessed the union and it came to be a holy place and a holy word.</p>
