<p>Pungi rays were a rare, mundane species of aquatic animal in the ray family.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>On average, a pungi ray grew to be 6 feet (1.8 meters) and 15 feet (4.6 meters) across. They had sharp spines that were of a greenish or brown hue, making them resemble plant growth when concealed. Having a particularly resemblance to seaweed. These spines varied in length from 1​ to ​2 feet (0.3​ to ​0.61 meters) and covered an area of 3​ to ​4 feet (0.91​ to ​1.2 meters) on a pungi ray's body, with twelve spines altogether.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Like other species of ray, this creature tended to hide its body beneath the silt and sand of the seafloor so they could surprise their prey. However, because of this, other creatures like humans were often at risk of stepping upon their spines. If they were ever truly attacked, pungi rays would try to flee from their attacker.</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>The spines on the backs of pungi rays were lined with poison .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Pungi rays lived largely solitary lives, though occasionally they could be found in pairs or groups of three.</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Like all species of ray, pungi rays were carnivorous creatures. They primarily fed upon mollusks and crustaceans.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Like most species of ray, pungi rays inhabited tropical shallow waters.</p>
<p>In the Realms, they were only known to be found in the land of Zakhara .</p>
