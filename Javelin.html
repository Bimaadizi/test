<p>Javelins were a type of simple, thrown, ranged weapon, similar to a shortspear .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Javelins were light, flexible spears designed primarily as a throwing weapon, but were equally suitable for melee. They were usually constructed of wood and tapered to a sharp point at one or both ends. Alternatively, they could be tipped with a small metal spearhead. The shaft was much thinner than a spear intended for melee combat.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>The javelin was a ranged weapon, intended to be thrown. Javelins were not sturdy enough for most melee combat and if wielded in this way they would perform poorly. The normal maximum range of a javelin was 150 feet (46 meters).</p>
<p>Javelins could easily be used on both foot or mountedback.</p>
