<p>Tempera , or Tempera of Fenwick , was a Netherese archwizard .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The arcanist was the ruler of Doubloon , a floating city.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 2214 NY (−1645 DR) , Tempera became interested in the ground-based bandit city, Doubloon. The bandits especially piqued her interest, as they were very skilled at making counterfeit gold coins. She transformed Doubloon into a flying city, and from then on created quasimagical implements to help the bandits. However, other archwizards were not happy with the fake coins entering their own cities, and Tempera became very unpopular.</p>
<p>Tempera's rogue city would float above the land for many centuries. A great archwizard, Ioulaum , grew tired of Tempera's antics and sent out search parties to track her down. However, Tempera managed to avoid each of these. After Ioulaum's efforts failed, Karsus himself attempted to trap Tempera and her city in 3417 NY (−442 DR) . However, Tempera seemed to escape yet again, as Doubloon disappeared into thin air. The truth of how Tempera and her city disappeared remained unknown.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Many believed that Karsus banished her city into a fiendish demiplane , though others thought she made the city entirely invisible. Some even claimed that Shadow had managed to discover the demiplane she was banished to.</p>
<p>The Tempera Channel may have been named after her.</p>
