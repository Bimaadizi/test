<p>Battlebanners Passage was a hallway in Castle Obarskyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The passage held a succession of faded trophies along its length. There were doors along its length; at least two doors, one on each side, led to narrow, dimly lit passageways.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the aftermath of the massacre during the Council of the Dragon in late Mirtul of the 1479Â DR , the War Wizards Welwyn Tracegar and Yarjack Blamreld used it to go towards Glathra Barcantle ; they took no great notice of Mirt and Storm Silverhand moving across the hallway, perpendicular to them.</p>
