<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the conflict known as the Battle of the Evermoors sometime around 1400 DR , the Elk tribe battled the Cult of the Dragon for control of the helmet of disjunction . Sven, however, completely missed it, having stepped out of the bath that morning, slipped on a wet stone floor, and fell and hit his head, killing him. Nevertheless, he and the fallen Elk tribesmen were buried at a sacred burial ground on the site .</p>
<p>A century later, in the late 1490s DR, the body of Sven Salafin was exhumed by Edgin Darvis , Simon Aumar , Doric , and Holga Kilgore (a member of the Elk tribe herself). Using Simon's deathly token to speak with the dead , they questioned Sven's corpse over the fate of the helmet of disjunction , only to find they had the wrong Salafin. Sven did ask how his brother was doing though.</p>
