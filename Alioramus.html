<p>Alioramus and the larger variety known as alioramus colossa were a species of carnivorous dinosaurs (or garuda ) found inhabiting the jungles of Chult on the Chultan Peninsula .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Alioramus were dangerous and meticulous hunters. They had powerful jaws that could crush a set of inch-thick plate mail . They had colorful hides and feathers and clawed three-toed limbs.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Alioramus attacked with their sharp, raking claws and powerful jaws, causing open wounds and bleeding. In combat, they pounced on their victims, pushing them to the ground into a vulnerable position. The largest of the species, alioramus colossa, could provoke a mating frenzy by exuding mating pheromones, driving its pack into a berserker -like rage, strengthening the pack's attacks and making them temporarily resistant to harm and unaffected by charm or fear .</p>
