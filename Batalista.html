<p>Batalista was a grand mage and the creator of the enchanted ring known as Batalista's Passport .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Not much was known about Batalista despite his title and arcane prowess. His main achievement was the creation of Batalista's Passport , a powerful version of a ring of fire resistance he planned to use in his travels across the Elemental Plane of Fire . In creating the ring, Batalista summoned a salamander on numerous occasions to tap into its knowledge of fire magic . Eventually, the elemental creature lost all patience with the wizard and managed to incinerate Batalista's tower with him inside. After the flames died off, Batalista's Passport was found on a ripped-off finger, untouched by the flames. The ring's creation was completed and Batalista would've likely survived the inferno if his ring finger was still attached to his hand.</p>
