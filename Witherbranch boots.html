<p>Witherbranch boots were enchanted boots created by the Arcane Brotherhood .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Witherbranch boots were made of leather, rotted with age. The edges of the boots had dead vines and twigs stuck to them like drapery.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These boots possessed a simple enchantment that rendered the wearer immune to the entangle spell and similar magical effects by killing and rotting away any vegetation that touched them. This magic made Witherbranch boots unusable by druid and rangers .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , several mages of the Host Tower of the Arcane set out to crusade against various nature-worshiping people of the Icewind Dale . To help them in the fruitless endeavor, they enchanted numerous pairs of Witherbranch boots and equipped the Arcane Brotherhood agents in the north. This was the operation's downfall as the agents of the Hosttower lest an easily-trackable trail of dead vegetation killed by the boots' magic. Druids followed the invaders and, using their polar bear wild shape , slaughtered and consumed every single one of them, leaving only the boots behind.</p>
<p>A pair of these boots found a way into the hands of members of the Legion of the Chimera that menaced the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale in 1312 DR.</p>
