<p>The Tree of Life was a colossal tree that grew in the middle of the Wealdath . It was the source of great magical power to the forest's elves , especially those in Suldanessellar , the treetop city built atop its branches.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The tree's branches were so massive that they supported an entire city.</p>
<p>Within the nearby temple of Rillifane, there was a grove with a small tree that sprouted nuts. Some of these nuts could be used to regrow any damaged branches from the Tree of Life.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the exiled mage Jon Irenicus broke through the defenses of Suldanessellar, captured Queen Ellesime , and poisoned the Tree of Life. He attached a number of parasites to the tree's branches and performed a ritual that siphoned its powers to himself. He sought to displace the god Rillifane Rallathil from the Seldarine and take his place.</p>
<p>Abdel Adrian stopped Irenicus before his dark magic killed the tree. The two of them fought within its branches and were both killed in the battle.</p>
