<h2>History</h2>
<p>Zurk was formerly Zircon Gemfacet, a gem-dealer who had a part-time interest in adventuring . He fell afoul of a scarab of insanity , and was rendered permanently insane. Unable to continue in his old life, he became a full-time adventurer. He was eventually hired into the Ruby Blades when they ran short of muscle, and they used him to great effect in melee combat, flushing out hidden enemies, and triggering traps.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the Ruby Blades joined the Wolfmasters company on an excursion to explore and loot Orvaskyte Keep in the Vast Swamp . The Ruby Blades were heavily delayed, and by the time they arrived their allies were already dead. Seeking a new goal, they attempted to hunt a nearby black dragon , only to be overwhelmed and almost killed by it, and were rescued by a band of Cormyrean adventurers. Their fortune waxed once more, and they were joined by two-dozen mercenaries that allowed them to chase away the Cormyreans and secure what was left of Orvaskyte Keep.</p>
