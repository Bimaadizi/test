<p>The Moonclaws were a thieving band in Hastarl , Athalantar , during the early 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The leader of the band was Isparla , though she almost certainly was a front for one or more Magelords of Athalantar .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Moonclaws were known to pilfer, thieve, and also fight, or sometimes just slay, others who did the same in the territory they claimed.</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>It was common for Moonclaw operations to have a lookout or two, armed with bows . Notably, they seemed to have no fear of the Magelords, acting openly and moving through streets instead of on rooftops.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Moonclaws were known to operate out of a certain uptown bathhouse .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>They were believed to be working for a wealthy patron or the Magelords; according to rival thief Tassabra , this belief was later proven correct.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Moonclaws were first attested to in the late autumn to early winter of the Year of the Black Flame, 229 DR , when they clashed with two local thieves of Hastarl, Farl and Eladar the Dark (secretly, prince Elminster Aumar ). At a later date, they clashed with these two thieves again on the docks, where both groups were trying to make away with some bolts of Calishite silk .</p>
<p>After the two formed a rival guild, the Velvet Hands , the Moonclaws attacked them overnight, slaying two of them on the first night. The Velvet Hands retaliated by ambushing them as the Moonclaws robbed Athalgard castle in the city, slaying three of them. However, a gargoyle later pursued the Velvet Hands, and the Moonclaws converged on them just as they were able to defeat it, eliminating all but two of their rivals. Of the two surviving Hands, one of them, Tassabra, died of her wounds later.</p>
<p>Eladar, last survivor of the Velvet Hands, later ambushed the Moonclaws at a warehouse, slaying a number of theirs. They tried to smoke him out by setting it ablaze, but he managed to escape. In response, he set ablaze the home of Isparla, leader of the Moonclaws. She retreated to the Roost, where he attempted to corner them, but the battle was halted by the intervention of Magister Dorgon Heamiiolothtar , who rescued Eladar before anyone died, and resurrected Farl.</p>
<p>One later clash with the same thieving duo of Farl and Eladar at the bridal suite of Peeryst Trumpettower and Nanue Glarmeir had a similar result as the first two, with hardly anything of value stolen by either side. By Farl's account, the Moonclaws were likely to dissolve afterwards, having lost much of their numbers.</p>
<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>The three Blaenbar brothers, in particular Klaern Blaenbar , were suspected to have joined the Moonclaws already by Farl, but this was never known for sure.</p>
