<p>Lord Terrathy Lightfinger was the young patriarch of the Lightfinger Family of Waterdeep in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He had a reputation for being erratic and neglecting his duties to the city of Waterdeep.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He kept a personal diary that discussed the various schemes of his family, and inside of which he also hid a map of his mansion showing its secret chambers. This map was perhaps the only way of finding the location of his private study.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point in the late 15 th century DR, Terrathy was the target of an assassination attempt using slithering trackers .</p>
<p>While his family had been complicit in a contract with the pit fiend known as Kurgaloth to help destabilize Waterdeep, Terrathy tried to back out of the deal when his family was called upon to conceal the rise of the city's enemies in Forestfall Fen and the Heartcoil Deeps . This, of course, angered Kurgaloth, but before the pit fiend could retaliate to enforce the contract, Terrathy was attacked by Jurrgal , a rakshasa who had sworn revenge against his ancestor, Donovan Lightfinger . Apparently unaware that the family was under the protection of Kurgaloth, Jurrgal had hoped to capture his enemy's family and take their place using his ability to shapechange .</p>
<p>Somehow, Terrathy escaped the clutches of Jurrgal and fled. His disappearance was widely explained away as him having sequestered himself within his mansion, but his vanishing from public life emboldened his family's many enemies among the Waterdhavian nobility . Meanwhile, Jurrgal and Kurgaloth butted heads over whose agenda took precedence: the rakshasa's revenge or the pit fiend's contract.</p>
