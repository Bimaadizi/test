<p>Bahija Jalin was a potion vendor who lived in Huzuz in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Due to skillful application of make-up, Bahija appeared to be in her 90's. In fact, she was only 27 years old.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Most of Bahija's potions were non-magical but highly alcoholic. She sold these to unsuspecting fools or foreigners visiting Huzuz. Bahija was able to craft a potion of ventriloquism , but she rarely had these for sale in her shop.</p>
<p>Customers could arrange for Bahija to cast the evil eye on someone if the price was right. She could also remove the curse of the evil eye from those who were afflicted.</p>
