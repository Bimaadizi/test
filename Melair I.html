<p>King Melair I (then known only as Melair ) first discovered mithral ore beneath Mount Waterdeep in −1288 DR and set about rallying together shield dwarves who would eventually create Melairbode and form Clan Melairkyn on that site. Although he passed away at an unknown time in the distant past, his ghost still occupies the royal crypt deep within the Undermountain and he firmly believes Clan Melairkyn is still a living clan.
