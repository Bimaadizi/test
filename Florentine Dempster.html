<p>Florentine Dempster was the Lady Lord of Turmish between 150 and 154 DR , following the death of her husband, Lord Dempster Turmish .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Florentine Dempster's rule began in the Year of the Lost Library, 150 DR after Dempster Turmish dies in his sleep. Before his death, the Lord of Turmish was amassing a navy force to helm another strike on the city of Hlondeth , following an unsuccessful invasion in the Year of the Risen Towers, 146 DR . Florentine's first decree was to call the war off, exercise diplomacy, pursuing peace with the bitter historical rival. Her reign lasted only for four years as Lady Lord Florentine Dempster was assassinated in the Year of the Jealous Hag, 154 DR . The rulership of Turmish fell into the hands of wealthy and influential Merchant Princes, regularly passing from one family to another. This period of 100 years that followed Dempster Turmish's death became known as The Calmwaters due to lack of any major historic events and prosperity of the Vilhon Reach .</p>
