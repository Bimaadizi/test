<p>Riatavin was a city in Amn and later Tethyr in west Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>A group of merchants known as the Chosen Council governed the city in the 15th century DR.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>A popular local periodical chapbook called Dansarra's Delights was inspired by a long-gone undead dancer and courtesan whose name and attitude was used to write skewering reviews of local businesses, performances, and opinion pieces about local public figures.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The city was primarily defended by the Ring Knights of Riatavin, a force of mounted troops armed with longswords , shields, and rods, adorned in chainmail armor. In 1370 DR , the Ring Knights were 3000 in number.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The city was originally founded by its namesake, Riatan Krimmevol. He, along with two others, founded the trade city after spotting the landmark later known as Riatan's Needle and building a settlement around it. Formerly a city of Amn , Riatavin seceded to become part of Tethyr in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR .</p>
<p>On the Feast of the Moon of 1370 DR, the Herald Thorn Tree disappeared hours before he was to perform the Bloodsong . This triggered a storm of controversy. First, there were rumors that the High Heralds had plans to expel Thorn Tree for corruption. Second, the rebel government of Riatavin had hoped to use the Bloodsong to assert their authority over the city amidst their secession from Amn to Tethyr. Third, some claimed that Thorn Tree had been working for, variously, Amn, Tethyr, the Knights of the Shield , or another faction of Riatavin. Thus, Thorn Tree's disappearance was expected to be powerful political ammunition for all these factions, further disrupting the secession. In fact, Thorn Tree had actually been murdered by one the Eldreth Veluuthra , and his body hidden so well it might never be found.</p>
<p>The city lost population in the years after the Spellplague and, as of 1479 DR , parts of the city were abandoned.</p>
<p>Riatavin had a significant criminal underworld and the Shadow Thieves were the dominant criminal organization. The city also suffered from bandit incursions from Erlkazar .</p>
