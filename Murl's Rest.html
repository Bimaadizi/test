<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Murl's Rest stood on the crossing of several major streets: Stormshore Street came into the strake on the western side, crossed it, and continued in the southeast. On the opposite side of where Stormshore exited the strake, Hulkael Street ended after reaching Murl's Rest's southern side. And lastly, the Old Town Avenue , that ran parallel a part of Stormshore Street and connected Murl's Rest to another strake just three city blocks south.</p>
