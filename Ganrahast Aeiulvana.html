<p>Ganrahast Aeiulvana was the Royal Mage of Cormyr and Chairman of the College of War Wizards in the late 15 th century DR . Known in his childhood only as Ganrion , he was the son of Myrmeen Lhal and Vangerdahast . He was groomed for the role of Royal Magician by Laspeera Inthré , starting in the Year of the Fallen Friends, 1399 DR , and assumed the post sometime in the 15 th century DR. He lived for over a century.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ganrahast had brown eyes and crimson hair. By 1479 DR , despite having lived over a hundred years, his red hair was only then beginning to show streaks of silver.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He didn't have the presence of either of his famous parents and as a child, Ganrahast was a quiet boy. As Royal Magician, he privately felt unworthy of his title, and was haunted by his failures. He wondered if those were a product of his lack of an extraordinary magical ability or simply the ghosts of the great women what preceded him.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as public figure, he was very different. He directed the War Wizards at the time of King Foril's reign with confidence, and had a sharp intellect.</p>
<p>Ganrahast blamed himself for the death of Princess Jemra Rhindaun , as he was of the belief that her death at the hand of assassins aimed at King Azoun V was caused by a failure of one his wards. He shared this guilty sentiment with no one, however.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Although his magical abilities did not appear to rival those of his predecessors, he was a competent and level-headed spellcaster.</p>
<p>He had the ability to blend in with others, letting him learn more of their intentions then they would otherwise give away willingly. His sharp and even morbid intellect allowed him to foresee threats most people wouldn't have even considered.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ganrahast was born in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , the son of Myrmeen Lhal , the long-serving Lady Lord of Arabel . Unknown to most during the boy's childhood, his father was former Royal Magician Vangerdahast Aeiulvana , a fact his mother decided to conceal until the moment the child showed his aptitude as a spellcaster. She decided this under the advisement of fellow courtier Laspeera Inthré . During that time, he was known in the kingdom as Ganrion, and was raised in the royal court in Suzail . As such, he grew up in the time of the kingdom's Five Ladies, a time when the kingdom's politics were heavily influenced by five female figures, and the nation knew women to be as capable as men in rulership, battle, and spell-hurling.</p>
<p>After the death of Caladnei in the Year of the Fallen Friends, 1399 DR , Laspeera assumed the role of Court Wizard and began tutoring Ganrahast to assume the role of Royal Mage.</p>
<p>In the Year of Silent Waterfalls, 1438 DR , it was Ganrahast who discovered that Crown Prince Emvar had fathered a son prior to his death.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Ganrahast was imprisoned by one of Manshoon 's servants in magical stasis in a crypt beneath the Royal Palace in Suzail. Elminster and Vangerdahast 's shade rescued Ganrahast but he missed King Foril's Dragon Council.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Ganrahast was of course the son of Myrmeen Lhal and Vangerdahast. As such, he had two sisters: Myrmeen's adopted daughter Krystin and his mother's lost daughter in Suldolphor , Lynelle Argreeves . His niece was Nalara Marliir , daughter of Krystin.</p>
<p>His closest friend was his second-in-command, the Lord Warder Vainrence . Though Ganrahast was unsure of the more bellicose direction Vainrance sought to take the War Wizards in, he hadn't reined him in up until at least 1479 DR.</p>
