<p>Balarystul was a spy of Bahamut who posed as a Calishite barber named Burney inside the Wandering Emporium , which traveled across the plains of Avernus in the Nine Hells in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Burney provided all the services of a professional barber, including healing injuries. While performing her work she would tell all kinds of stories, but always ones that provided a moral lesson. This was only a cover for her true work: spying on Tiamat on the direct orders of Bahamut, who hoped to stop the Dragon Queen from rising once more.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>On the surface, Burney was cheerful but remained keenly observant, looking for any news about the followers of Tiamat, especially Arkhan the Cruel .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Balarystul had received a particular blessing from Bahamut: any creature less powerful than a deity that spoke with her quickly forgot about their conversation, as she was under the permanent effect of a spell of mind blank . Furthermore, she could instantly teleport herself into the Wandering Emporium or directly to the court of Bahamut.</p>
