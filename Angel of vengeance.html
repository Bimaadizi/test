<p>An angel of vengeance was an angel sent to punish those who defied or angered the gods , or to test a mortal who was in danger of falling from the path a deity set for them.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These winged angels had a fiery essence and glowed with an internal light that was said to burn away lies. Their skin was bright, radiating both light and heat. Their wings appeared insubstantial, and to be composed of light and shadow. Their eyes were hauntingly colorless and ringed with darkness, but would blaze when the angel's fury was evoked. They spoke with loud, harsh voices.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>These angels showed no mercy. They did not hesitate to sacrifice followers of their god to achieve their greater goals.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>When in battle, these immortals wore plate mail and favored dual longswords , which glowed with white light. They prioritized one foe at a time, and pursued their target relentlessly regardless of whatever else was going on in the battle. These angels could mark their target with an invisible sign that allowed them to teleport to within melee range.</p>
<p>At their full power, an angel of vengeance's internal light blazed brightly enough to light an entire room, and this holy light further seemed to propagate by causing objects and creatures it illuminated to in turn begin glowing from within. Illusions were dispelled by this light. In this form, the angel's skin was burningly hot. If slain, the light was immediately extinguished, although the angel's flesh would continue to shine.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Influential clergy members were known to use a powerful ritual to call forth one of these angels to deal out their deity's wrath. They also punished failure and disloyalty among their deity's followers.</p>
<p>These angels were generally encountered alone, but would sometimes operate in groups alongside angels of battle or of valor . An angel of vengeance could pass for human if they wished, although this required apparent effort: they compacted their size down into a smaller body, made their wings invisible, and dimmed their internal lights.</p>
