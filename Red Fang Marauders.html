<p>The Red Fang Marauders , or simply the Red Fang , was a goblin and goblinoid tribe of marauding bandits, secretly allied with the Zhentarim , that menaced the Western Heartlands in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR, the Red Fang Marauders targeted the environs of Baldur's Gate, striking at traveling caravans from a base that was well hidden from the Gate's guards. One of the marauders' lairs was hidden in a cave within the Trollbark Forest from where they raided the Trade Way . One of the caravans that fell under the goblinoid attack was Randalla Brasshorn 's. She had led the caravan from Waterdeep to Baldur's Gate but it was attacked on the portion of the road south of Dragonspear Castle . That hideout was led by a goblin chieftain Bile-Tooth and housed kidnapped caravaners, including Randalla Brasshorn. Another goblin force set out for the Wayfork Village to pillage and ravage under the leadership of hobgoblin Harnak the Butcher.</p>
<p>Serendipitously, a group of adventurers came across Keaira , Randalla's caravan guard, and set out to find the Trollbark caves. Subsequently, they slew Bile-Tooth and freed the captured caravaners. Soon after, they defended Wayfork Village from the Red Fang Marauders and slew Harnak at the Wayfork Inn .</p>
<p>Subsequently, the adventurers tracked the Red Fang Marauders' to a cave lair in Cloak Wood and fought their way through the goblinoids, discovering the identity of the power behind the bandits - the mysterious woman called the Red Queen , clad in crimson heavy armor . When she was defeated, the Red Queen fled though a secret passage. The armored woman fled to her mistress Arogazia , who resided in the Firewind Manor . Arogazia revealed that the Red Queen was an abomination created by Luvia Bloodmire of Baldur's Gate. But eventually, with the Red Queen's demise, and Firewind Manor being consumed by a blaze, the Red Fang Marauders were no more.</p>
