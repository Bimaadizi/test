<p>Deric , sometimes called Deric of the Ffolk , was a chieftain of the Ffolk people of the Moonshae Isles and the first King of Corwell in the mid–2 nd century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Deric was the son of the "First Mother", Gwynneth , and of her consort, Taylor , who led the first Talfiric settlers to the Moonshaes. Deric was the last in their line, which would come to be called the First Dynasty of the Moonshaes .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Five years after his father's death against the Llewyrr elves , Deric's successes in battle allowed him to unite the Ffolk in the south of the isle of Gwynneth . He formed them into the new Kingdom of Corwell in the Year of the Dwarf, 149 DR .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Jealous Hag, 154 DR , King Deric and King Kaminas of Synnoria established a peace agreement between the Ffolk and the Llewyrr at the elven capital of Chysalis .</p>
<p>Deric ruled for twenty-two years before he died of natural causes in the Year of Unkind Weapons, 171 DR . He left no heir, and so Corwell descended into civil war until they were reunited by Callidyrr Hugh six years later.</p>
