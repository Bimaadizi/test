<p>The Irithlium was a renowned school for wizards found in the once-great city of Myth Drannor . After the fall of the City of Song in the 8 th century DR , the fabled school fell to ruin, attracting scavengers and other malevolent beings that sought to capture some of the powerful magics housed within.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It was located in the Noble's Ward of Myth Drannor, where Danglestar Street intersected with Dragon's Drive.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Irithlium comprised a central building, around which were built four separate wings and turrets of varying design. Little regard was given to a common architectural design, as none of the side structures shared the same features. While the southern and western wings each went as high up as six stories tall, the other two only reached four stories.</p>
<p>Extending underneath the school were an additional three subterranean floors. These underground passageways were well-concealed by expert craftsmanship and protected with lethal traps.</p>
<p>Even deeper beneath the underground levels was an expansive limestone cavern network. Its chambers were lined with cages used to imprison a wide variety of monstrous creatures.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The construction of the wizarding school was a continual project that continued on for over three centuries.</p>
<p>Following the destruction of Myth Drannor, the Irithlium became surrounded by a dead-magic zone . When the Cult of the Dragon took over part of the ruins, in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , wizards of their order attempted to bypass the zone's effects.</p>
<p>Within a few months after the phaerimm were released from beyond the Sharn Wall in Nightal of the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , at least a half dozen of the creatures had made their lair within the catacombs of the Irithlium. Their bugbear and mind flayer minions had delved into the furthest depths of the once-great elven school.</p>
<p>On Mirtul 19 of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Prince Escanor Tanthul tasked Vala Thorsdotter and the Shadovar officer Parth Gal with scouting out the phaerimm activity within the ruins of the school. Together with an undead ally , she rid the depths of the Irithlium from the aberrant presence.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The depths of the Irithlium were home to dangerous creatures including monstrous centipedes beholders , and even dark nagas .</p>
