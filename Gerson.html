The group was regularly attacked by goblins and eventually took refuge at the Emerald Grove within a community of druids . However, the tiefling refugees were waylaid by a goblin army â€“ the Cult of the Absolute , that sought to capture or slaughter the group. Gerson the Bent stayed with the group until the tieflings' fate at the fate of the Emerald Grove were decided.</p>
