<p>Jorgmacdon was a prolific conjurer of the Red Wizards of Thay responsible for imprisoning the Lord of the Hidden Layer, demon lord Eltab wishing the city of Eltabbar and the founding of the Thayan nation.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some mistakenly called Jorgmacdon the first Zulkir of the School of Conjuration during the Red Wizards' rebellion against Mulhorand of the Year of the Spouting Fish, 922 DR . However, the First Zulkirate would not be created for one hundred and aight years more, until the Year of Warlords, 1030 DR , with Tlantros Tulhoond becoming the first Zulkir of Conjuration.</p>
<p>In 922 DR, Jorgmacdon recovered an ancient ritual of the Narfelli demonbinders and created a tunnel that led directly to the demoncyst of Thaymount in which the demon lord Eltab had been imprisoned for over seven hundred years. Which this magic, Jorgmacdon unleashed Eltab to aid the Red Wizards in the Battle of Thazalhar against Mulhorand. Jorgmacdon's Narfelli magics created a crack in the demoncyst's bounds and as the result, created the River Eltar .</p>
<p>In the outcome of the Battle of Thazalhar, the Red Wizards established the nation of Thay, thanks to Jorgmacdon's rituals. However, Jorgmacdon realized that he was unable to dismiss the demon lord. Instead, the derived magics similar to those initially trapped Eltab. Jorgmacdon formed mammoth binding runes and imprisoned Eltab near the mouth of the River Eltar. The runes remained the demon lord's prison as buildings were erected, forming the capital of Eltabbar into an immense glyph that continued to contain the creature. With Jorgmacdon's death, his family remained active and prominent in Thay well into the mid-14 th century DR , but no family member reached Jorgmacdon's preeminence.</p>
<p>Many centuries later, in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Thayan spymaster, Naglatha began receiving visions in which she witnessed the Battle of Thazalhar and Jorgmacdon's magic that bound the demon lord. These visions recalled the historic events sent by Eltab in a ploy to orchestrate his release through subtle mental influence and manipulation. Naglatha witnessed the battle and all the Red Wizards who fought and fell alongside Jorgmacdon.</p>
