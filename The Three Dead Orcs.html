<p>The Three Dead Orcs was an inn in the village of Maskyr's Eye in the Vast in the 13 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Three Dead Orcs burned down and, perhaps due to its name, some very much alive orcs were thought to have encouraged the flames. Afterward, Riothar Orlsyr built a new inn called The Wizard's Hand to the north, some time around 1277 DR .</p>
