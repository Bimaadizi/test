<p>Gorun Pricebreaker was a dwarf merchant of the Sword Coast North and the proprietor of the Broken Crown inn on the High Road in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gorun purchased the Broken Crown in the late 1470s DR and reopened the establishment as trade and traffic along the High Road near Neverwinter became active once again.</p>
<p>The inn became a safe haven for travelers along the road near Raven Cliff Beach in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , as activity by the cutthroat Blackdagger Bandits forced many of them to seek safety and protection. Gorun sold goods and supplies to those who came through.</p>
