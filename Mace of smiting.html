It dealt the expected damage against beings of the Outer Planes , but had a chance of inflicting thrice the usual damage, at the cost of a charge. The rod of smiting could not be recharged.</p>
<p>The rod of smiting II had all of the powers of its non-Zakharan counterpart, but also had a greater chance to completely destroy copper automatons and living idols .</p>
