<p>The Valiant Warriors were a long-standing adventuring company based in Telflamm .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Valiant Warriors usually protected commerce in the lands east and north of the Sea of Fallen Stars from Rashemen 's borders to Damara . However, they were no longer welcomed in Impiltur for their run-ins with authorities there. They always followed the dogma of Tymora to live dangerously. However, in time, they also invested their money in a merchant fleet on the Inner Sea.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Valiant Warriors had a very large number of heroic exploits to tell: they seized an entire duergar town, saved a Rashemi witch from forty ogres , and defeated a pirate ship just after it had raided the Telflamm port.</p>
<p>Around 1357 DR , some of their female retired members had become ladies in Telflamm.</p>
