<p>Rune Knights were fighters that enhanced their martial prowess using the supernatural power of runes .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Rune knights engaged in increasing their knowledge about rune carving and the general use of runes to enhance martial abilities. They also learnt how to use smithing tools and how to speak, read, and write Jotun .</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>The ancient practice of enhancing abilities with runes originated with giant artisans . Many rune knights likely learned their methods first or second hand from such a mystical craftsman. Some found a giant's work carved into a hill or cave, while others learned of the runes from a sage , or met a giant in person. Regardless they studied the giant's craft and learned how to apply magic runes to empower their equipment.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Rune knights were proficient with smithâ€™s tools, and knew to speak, read, and write Giantish. They were also adept at using shields , any armor , simple weapons and martial weapons .</p>
<p>These fighters could use magic runes to enhance their gear ( weapons , a suit of armor, a shield, a piece of jewelry , or something else they could wear or hold in a hand) by rune carving . Rune carving worked through touch. By touching an object a rune knight inscribed a rune onto it. The rune remained on an object for some time, and an object could only bear one such rune at a time. With practice, rune carving became easier for rune knights.</p>
<p>Rune knights could choose from many different runes, each with very different effects.</p>
<h3>Notable magic runes</h3>
<p>Rune knights could imbue themselves with the might of giants for 1 minute. By doing so they became large sized (if they weren't large and if there was enough space), stronger and make more destructive attacks with weapons or their hands.</p>
<p>They could potentially use this ability multiple times a day. The knights were also able to invoke runic shields to potentially protect their allies from successful attacks by making the attacks fail. They could potentially use this ability multiple times a day.</p>
<p>Especially mighty rune knights became permanently altered by the rune magic.They became more powerful when imbuing themselves with the might of giants and grew to huge sizes (if they weren't huge and if there was enough space).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The practice of rune carving which is used extensively by rune knights is based on ancient rune based magic that was used by giants for many years.</p>
