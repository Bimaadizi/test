<p>Monstrous scorpions or giant scorpions were a breed of arachnids known for their venomous stingers. They were found in warm deserts.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These creatures were reported to have a green carapace with yellowish green legs and pincers, and a black segmented tail. However brown and black specimens had been observed by those who survived encounters with the creatures. A bitter smell surrounded the giant scorpions, probably stemming from the venom in their tail-stingers.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Attacking all other creatures that comes within range, the giant scorpions seeked to grab their prey with their claws and while holding onto the prey, stabbed it with their venomous tail. Highly deadly the scorpion poison could kill most prey that were injected from the tail-stinger, even the giant scorpions themselves were not immune to the venom, and should they accidentally stab themselves they too were likely to die. They were able to fight 3 enemies at once by using both claws and stinger against separate opponents.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>On the continent of Faerûn , giant scorpions could be found in the Anauroch desert, the Calim Desert , the Raurin Desert , and the Quoya Desert . They could also be found in the jungles of Chult , including a rare subspecies known as venomtail scorpions , whose poison was highly sought after by local hunters . The giant scorpions laired in underground burrows or in dungeons, laying between 5 and 20 eggs, and often dragging their victims back into their lairs to be consumed.</p>
<h3>Uses</h3>
<p>In Zakhara , the Wind of Fate often applied venom from giant scorpions to their blowgun darts.</p>
<p>Some races were known to use their chitin to construct armor.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Monstrous scorpions were known to be used by members of the Refuge Bay Trading Company of Chult . These scorpions were either trained or magically bound to a representative, both as defenders and enforcers. One of these representatives with a giant scorpion could be found in Baldur's Gate docks circa 1360 DR . The scorpion served as hands of his master, as he lost one hand as punishment, and the other was paralyzed in a fist. The monstrous scorpion was also a reminder and overseer of that Refuge Bay Trading Company to ensure he never stole from them again.</p>
<h3>Summoning</h3>
<p>A small fiendish monstrous scorpion could be summoned with the summon monster I spell . The spell summon monster II could be used to summon a medium-sized fiendish monstrous scorpion, while a large fiendish monstrous scorpion required the spell summon monster V . For a huge fiendish monstrous scorpion specimen to be summoned the spell summon monster VII were needed. Only with summon monster IX would a gargantuan fiendish monstrous scorpion answer the call of the caster.</p>
