<p>A teleport gem was a device that teleported the user.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Teleport gems teleported the user to a predetermined location.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>One such teleport gem was owned by Florin Falconhand in the mid-14 th century DR ; it was keyed to Evermeet , where the elven mother of his child lived.</p>
<p>Another such gem was owned by Queen Filfaeryl Obarskyr of Cormyr , who refused to use it to transport herself to safety during the ambush in Thundaerlyn Hall , in Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , at the hands of the Rightful Conspiracy . The gem was instead shattered by one of the conspirators while trying to skewer her with a blade.</p>
<p>The mage Carmanstos of Raven's Bluff created teleport gems of his own by imbuing enchantments in gemstones, which released spells when shattered. Another mage in Raven's Bluff, Aleesia , may have furnished a different kind of teleport gem to adventurers, possibly a silver orb which she may have named as a gem by mistake.</p>
