<p>Lord Bly Ruldegost was a proud and honorable member of the Knights of the Shield and the regent for the infant heir of House Ruldegost , circa 1368 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>While Ruldegost attempted to recruit other Waterdhavian nobles to his order, he did not believe in instituting a Knight of the Shield within the ranks of the Lords of Waterdeep , which put him at odds with his superiors.</p>
<p>Lord Bly was the regent for his young nephew, Detan . He spent quite a lot of time in Riatavin representing the Knights of the Shield and his family's co-ownership of the Thousandheads Trading Coster .</p>
<p>He supported the creation of a new duchy in eastern Amn , based in Riatavin, to be headed by Lord Mundal Krimmevol , but desired Lord Mundal to become a member of the Knights and give assurance of increased trade links between Riatavin and the rest of Amn to the west. At the end of the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Lord Bly assisted in negotiating support for the creation of the new duchy in exchange for gathering support from several noble families for Lord Pehllus Tanislove 's bid to become the new king of Amn.</p>
