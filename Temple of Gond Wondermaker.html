<p>The Temple of Gond Wondermaker , also known as the House of the Wonderbringer , and called Gharri's House during Gharri 's time, was a temple dedicated to Gond in the city of Tilverton , and the largest temple in the city.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple was located in the southwest section of the city atop the Old Town rise, near the ruins of Tilver's Palace .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The main entrance of Gond's temple resembled a massive anvil. Its architecture featured stark, powerful shapes that stood in contrast to the surrounding shops.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid-14 th century DR , the high priest of the temple, Gharri , served as the respected Elder of the city, making him the closest thing to a ruling figure. The temple itself was one of the grandest structures in the town. When Cormyr annexed the city in 1356 DR , Gharri briefly served as Lord Regent before leaving in disgust. He was replaced as high priest by Burlan Almaether .</p>
<p>Many of Gond's faithful temporarily lost their faith during the Time of Troubles in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR .</p>
<p>As of 1367 DR , the temple had recently invented an ingenious float valve that aided in the regulation of water flow.</p>
<p>The temple was presumed destroyed along with the rest of Tilverton in 1372 DR , creating the Tilverton Scar .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The temple was run by High Priest Burlan Almaether , who was filling in for his missing predecessor Gharri . Burlan was assisted by 26 other priests and 39 followers, including Castar , Phylanna , and Rull .</p>
