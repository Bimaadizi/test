<h2>History</h2>
<p>Curampah joined Nogah in her expedition to the depths in 1395 DR , following her visions.</p>
<p>While exploring the side of the vent, Curampah discovered a ruined illithid city. Proximity to it caused the charm protecting them from the crushing weight of the water to unravel; he quickly woke Nogah up. Looking together, they discovered an undead mind flayer guarding the location. After some struggling, they defeated it with a lightning bolt. Searching through the city, they discovered a great six-sided iron door, which Nogah felt was the locus of her visions. Curampah died after the two of them managed to open the valve door with coordinated blasts of lightning. They were carried across the door in a great rush of water, as the pressure of the Sea of Fallen Stars filled the site protected by the door; he hit his head while thrown around by the torrent.</p>
