<p>Black ice beholder was an artifact , a unique figurine of wondrous power that captured a memory of a black ice beholder that once plagued Icewind Dale in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This figurine of wondrous power was a twisted and corrupted artifact, tainted by the evil magic of the black ice . Instead of conjuring forts a creature, it manifested a memory of a black ice beholder. The image then moved forward, where its summoner was looking, and once it reached an enemy, the beholder exploded violently.</p>
<p>When the figurine of wondrous power was wielded by someone who also possessed the cloak of black ice and the greater belt of black ice , the set boosted all of its items' offensive power.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The black ice beholder appeared for the first time in the Year of the Iron Dwarf's Vengeance, 1485 DR , during the black ice crisis in Icewind Dale.</p>
