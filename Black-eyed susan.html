<p>Black-eyed susans were a type of a flower in the Realms that could be found growing in the Moonsea North and the Vast .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These flowers were brightly colored and bore some resemblance to the blooms found on an echinacea .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the late 14 th century DR , a shop in the city of Ravens Bluff known as Flora's Flower Shop carried black-eyed susans. They were kept outside the shop in a bucket, underneath a sign written in Common inviting customers to "Hep yoreselfs to a free flowa." At the time the flowers sold by Flora served as badges of official entry whilst in the hidden market of Flask Circle . If she couldn't convince a visitor to purchase one her flowers she would insist they take and wear one of the black-eyed susans offered outside, as lacking a flower whilst in Flask Circle would signify that an individual had snuck into the hidden market.</p>
