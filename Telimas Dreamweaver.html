<h2>History</h2>
<p>Many years before the Year of the Gauntlet, Telimas had a vision of an army of spiders marching across Faer√ªn , being led by a dark-skinned female elf who wore a glittering silver crown. He took this intuitive dream and led the gnomes living throughout the trees to form a trading post within the forest. They began to trade with the Dalesmen and specialized in the sale of spider-related goods.</p>
