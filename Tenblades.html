<p>The Tenblades was a small group of adventures active in Vaasa before much of the region had been explored or settled.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Tenblades used their own wealth to fund the construction of the fortress of Darmshall . Darmshall's construction was prompted by the leader of the Tenblades, Romas Thunderclap , after two of their members were murdered. Romas figured the presence of the fortress would deter future attacks in the region. Darmshall's defenses were well-constructed, as even Zhengyi could not conquer the keep.</p>
