<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the city of Elturel was pulled down from Toril into the Nine Hells , in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , many Elturgardians fled their home for safer lands. Dara a priestess of Ilmater , and Ghorin , an elderly shepherd were two such individuals that rallied people to form a refugee caravan, en route to Baldur's Gate . Billiam was convinced to join the caravan by the miller Ippon and her assistant Pal , albeit only after they gathered materials for him to make travel journal to document their journey.</p>
<p>After the caravan finally made its way west towards Baldur's Gate, tragedy struck one night during the journey. Billiam was slaughtered in gruesome fashion, his throat slit and a strange marking was made on his chest in blood. The murderer was a secret cultist of Zariel who hid amongst the refugees, Vollis Foote . Billiam's journal included a heroic description of their journey, but ultimately stopped on the night of his death.</p>
