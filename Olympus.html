The pleasant cities and villages were built with characteristic white walls along the shores of a blue sea or scattered among the mountainsides. Towering mountains, cut by huge passes, give rise to colossal broad-leaved trees, reaching heights rivaling those of the mighty terrestrial sequoias .</p>
<p>Tyche 's realm was located on the slopes of Mount Olympus in a relatively small estate among the huge temples and estates dedicated to other deities that took up residence in the realm.</p>
<p>Hephaestus ' forge lay at the centre of a volcano within an active region near the base of Mount Olympus.</p>
