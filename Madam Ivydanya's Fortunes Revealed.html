<p>Madame Iyvdanya attracted a steady clientele of sailors and pirates , who were known for their superstitions regarding fate and omens.

Madame Iyvdanya might also use oracle sticks or interpret the patterns formed by melted candle wax. In addition to her priestly abilities, she possessed psionic talents—such as aura sight, object reading, and precognition.</p>
<p>When Madame Iyvdanya foresaw ill fortune, a frequent occurrence in her readings, she advised her clients to follow folk remedies in an attempt to ward off the misfortune. Typical recommendations included wearing clothes inside out for a tenday . For particularly dire predictions, she might direct clients to the Sisters Three Waxworks to purchase a good luck charm or offer one herself, marked with the symbol of Tymora , for 10 gold pieces. These charms were sourced through a partnership with Ramora’s Guile Shipping , which supplied them from Waterdeep .
