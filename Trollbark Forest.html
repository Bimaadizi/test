<p>The Trollbark Forest was a forest along the Sword Coast , which lay between Baldur's Gate and Daggerford .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The forest was located to the north-west of Trollclaw Ford , and just north of the river known as Winding Water , as well as the Troll Hills . It was located between Orlumbor island (to the west) and Dragonspear Castle . (to the north-east)</p>
<p>Throughout the low vales of this forest were a multitude of bogs and swamps.</p>
<p>The Trollbark Forest was among the locations linked through the magical transportation network known as the Trail of Mists .</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>This forest was largely devoid of birds and small woodland creatures, having been wiped out by the forest's monstrous inhabitants. It was also home to a variety of monstrous trees, both carnivorous and poisonous . Mundane varieties of trees that could be found here included twisted oaks , black ashes , and scrub pines .</p>
<p>Due to the forest's thorny foliage, and the presence of poisonous snakes , it was seen as a hunting ground for monsters that were resistant to such toxins. Such as green skinned, mottled brown giant slugs that primarily fed upon the forest's leaves and mosses .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Knights of the Sword Coast , a group of famed adventurers, once traveled to the forest and took down the ancient lich, known as Berthist . However, the leader of the adventurers, as well as four other members of the company, perished in combat. In 1366 DR , the survivors were retired in Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The forest was teeming with bogs and underbrush, making it a perfect environment for its troll inhabitants. The trolls in this forest were led by giant two-headed trolls , regularly communicated with a colony of trolls in the Trollclaws , and would raid as far north as the Lizard Marsh , as far east as the High Moor , and as far south as the Trollclaw Ford.</p>
<p>These trolls lived in an uneasy co-existence with chokers , who formed highways of vines as well as toppled and intertwined branches.</p>
<p>Within deep caverns of this forest lived a small number of deepspawn , whose children were fed upon by trolls whenever food was scarce.</p>
