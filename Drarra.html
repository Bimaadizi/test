<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , as the Cult of the Absolute menaced the city of Baldur's Gate, Drarra attended a performance of showy magics by three spellslingers, on the Murl's Rest plaza in front of Sorcerous Sundries . The elf eagerly devoured the show with his eyes as the most fun he's had in the Gate, plagues by disappearings, murders, cultists, and corrupt politicians.</p>
