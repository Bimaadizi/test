<p>The Wilddwarf Brigade (also known as the Wilddwarves ) was a dwarven battlerager squad in Citadel Adbar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1484 DR , the Wilddwarves were led by a dwarf simply known as Crunch . In that year, Crunch and other Wilddwarves were present, with many of them killed, during an orcish sneak attack in which King Bromm was killed by Arauthator and Hartusk .</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>The Wilddwarves drank liquor before battle. One of their main tactics involved the use of "dwarf tossers": pairs of dwarves holding a plank on which another Wilddwarf stood; the pairs subsequently tossed their target dwarf into battle.</p>
