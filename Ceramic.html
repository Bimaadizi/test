<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Stoneware ceramic was considered a rare material of the type due to locally available components needed for its creation. It was fragile and hard to transport and clay that was available virtually everywhere was a much cheaper alternative.</p>
<h3>Types</h3>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<h3>Containers</h3>
<p>Ceramic jars were used as receptacles to store common table wine in across Faerûn. Notably, they were known for a satisfying uncorking sound that grew more pleasing the emptier the jar was. Appleberry ale , a sweet variety of ale from the Vast was fermented in large ceramic jugs before being bottled for sale. Large ceramic jars were used in wine-making in Muluk , a city in Zakhara . After the grapes were pulverized, their juice was strained and kept in ceramic urns. Larger ceramic jugs were used by travelers who crossed the Calim Desert to store drinking water on the camels ' backs.</p>

<h3>Cooking</h3>
<p>In the Blade Kingdoms , ceramics were common. Lomatran baked beans was a dish of beans and sausages cooked in heat-resistant jars of dense ceramics. The same material was used to create lightning -resistant war-shells called war-turtles , used in the civil war by Lorenzo Utrelli Da Lomatra and his adviser and military strategist Princess Milianna Mannicci da Sumbria .</p>
<p>Zakharan kaeth was prepared using ceramic kettles that carried boiling water before being poured into drinking receptacles.</p>
<h3>Tableware</h3>

Much of ceramics and bottles produced in the Bluff were made by the city's Ceramics guild . Ceramic cups were commonly used across the Dalelands . A typical ceramic mug from the Dales had a flat and rough base that curved down on the inside. The mug walls either slightly bubbled out or slightly curved inwards giving them two distinct shapes. Color-wise, a Dales mug had a single handle, a dark-colored base, a light ring around the rim, and a band of deep blue glaze in the mug's middle. The top and bottom parts of these mugs were painted with waving lines, fingertip impressions, flowering designs, or an image of sun radiating rays.</p>
