<p>Verraketh Talembar , later known as the Shadowking , was a monarch of the Talfir people, ruling from the city of Ebenfar . He was a master of shadow magic .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to The Book of the Shadows , although Verraketh was skilled in magic , he was slowly corrupted by his dark magic and his appearance turned monstrous. In time, Verraketh became known as the Shadowking. He ruled for a long time and claimed many lands as part of his domain. He later created the Nightstone using his own essence. However, he was tricked—the bard Talek Talembar (his own son ) had put an enchantment on the Nightstone, so that it could only obey him. They fought for seven days, until Talembar won. Talembar trapped the Shadowking within a crypt, then buried it in a great cairn the size of a hill. The city of Iriaebor would later be built atop this cairn.</p>
<p>Finally, in the Year of the Wyvern, 1363 DR , due to an error in the structure of the crypt, the Shadowking managed to get hold of a thief named Snake . Snake did as his master told him, and tricked Ravendas , a Zhentarim lord, into being her steward, feigning loyalty towards her. As "Lord Cutter", Ravendas took hold of Iriaebor and started digging into the tor hoping to find the Nightstone, so that she could amass power.</p>
<p>In an effort to stop Lord Cutter, Caledan Caldorien reformed the Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon , but they were betrayed and Ravendas captured some of its members and took them to the crypt of the Shadowking, which she had just discovered and was where the Nightstone resided. When Ravendas took up the Nightstone, she was killed by its magic, as she did not possess the power of shadow magic. She was transformed, and the Shadowking burst out from her corpse. Meanwhile, Morhion cut loose the bonds of the Fellowship, as that was his plan all along. As Morhion did this, Mari Al'maren threw her pipes to Caledan Caldorien, but Snake shot a bolt of magical energy to her, knocking her into unconsciousness. Kellen managed to kill Snake with a poisoned needle. With the pipes, Caledan played the shadow song, which was inscribed in Talfiric on the columns of the crypt, and the song tore the Nightstone asunder. In doing so, Caledan defeated the Shadowking. Afterward, the crypt collapsed, Ferret sacrificed himself so that the rest of the members of the Fellowship could escape.</p>
