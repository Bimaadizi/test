<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Lord Norwood was extremely protective of his daughter Seila . He initially had warm feelings toward Jack Ravenwild until he learned Jack wasn't really a noble.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Lord Norwood's daughter, Seila was captured by the slaver Fetterfist and sold into slavery to the drow who lived beneath Ravens Bluff. Seila was rescued by Jack Ravenwild, who returned her to Lord Norwood.</p>
<p>Norwood richly rewarded Jack with a 5,000 gold piece line of credit at a local counting house as well as the use of Maldridge House , a mansion in Ravens Bluff. Jack passed himself off as a minor noble from the Vilhon Reach , an area that had been devastated by the Spellplague . However, Lord Norwood hired sages to investigate Jack's claim and found it to be impossible. After learning of Jack's deceit, Norwood ordered Jack out of the mansion and told him to keep away from Seila.</p>
<p>Later, a noble revel attended by Lord Norwood and his daughter was attacked by Fetterfist and his gang. Seila and other surviving nobles were carried through a magic portal to the Underdark . Norwood and Myrkyssa Jelan led an armed force to the drow's domain and destroyed the drow. Jack jumped through the portal and rescued Seila once more from Fetterfist.</p>
