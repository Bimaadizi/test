<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A strongly built female drow, Velina had a rounder face than most other drow. She wore darkened drow chainmail and wrapped herself in a large black cloak. A prominent symbol of Kiaransalee was often displayed around her neck. Velina appeared identical in practically every way to her sister, Velasta.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Velina T'sarran was a drow of erratic moods, alternating between haughty and charming when dealing with others. However, she harbored nothing but contempt for her twin sister.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>An experienced drow cleric, Velina had a solid command of divine magic and was able to cast spells like flame strike and slay living in defense of her deity. In addition to this, she could craft both magical arms and armor , and magic wands .</p>
<p>Velina, like her sister, was an adaptive combatant and could adjust her tactics effectively when given the opportunity or when prepared.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>As a member of House T'sarran , Velian was outfitted with gear befitting a priestess of her station. She wore a magic set of drow chain , a cloak of resistance , and a ring of counterspells . In combat, she would wield a corrosive dagger and an enchanted shield .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Velina had a deep rivalry with her identical twin sister, Velasta T'sarran , to the extent that both of them would happily engineer situations where the other could be "accidentally" killed off. This hatred was only exacerbated after the coup of Szith Morcane, when Velasta acquired the larger share of the plunder.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As a female of House T'sarran, Velina had been schooled as a cleric of Kiaransalee along with her identical twin sister, Velasta. However, over the years, both sisters had developed an abiding hatred for each other.</p>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , during the Silence of Lolth , Velina and her sister worked with the rest of their house to overthrow the Lolth -worshiping drow of Maerimydra . Subsequently, they were sent to track down any refugees from the city under the supervision of their aunt, Dorina, and made their way to the drow outpost of Szith Morcane . On Marpenoth 12 , they managed to overthrow House Morcane in Szith Morcane and, under the orders of Dorina, Velina was sent into the Deep Wastes as a scout, while her sister Velasta was given free rein to turn the dead clerics of Lolth into quth-maren and use them to pillage the settlement.</p>
<p>While her sister was made part of the elite hunter-killer team by Dorina, Velina was assigned to lead the common raiding parties against the surface lands of Daggerdale . She harried a number of farms and homesteads in the Dagger Hills , roughly 3​ to ​4 miles (4.8​ to ​6.4 kilometers) from the Dordrien Crypts</p>
<p>At some point after a group of adventurers launched a raid on Szith Morcane, Velina and Velasta were raised as undead revenants .</p>
