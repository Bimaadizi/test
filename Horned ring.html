<p>The horned rings were eight enchanted rings that the mad wizard Halaster created for himself and his seven apprentices.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These iron rings had small horns rising out of them that curved backward toward the wearer's fingers.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Halaster imbued each of the eight horned rings with distinct powers and immunities, only accessible by the individual they were designed for. Anyone else who wore one of these rings had access to only one or more powers.</p>
<p>The most common power of the horned rings was similar to Halaster's teleportation rings or the greater teleport spell , but teleported the wearer to different locations within Undermountain . The wearer was also able to specify where they wished to teleport. Following the Spellplague , this was the only power of the rings available to laypeople.</p>
<p>The ring could break through any magical barriers, with the exception of prismatic walls or prismatic spheres , to get them there safely, allowing it to bypass Halaster's teleport cage . And the wearer could cloak themselves upon command in an antimagic aura .</p>
<p>In order to recharge itself, a horned ring would absorb any incoming magic missiles and magical and natural electrical energy directed at the wearer. The wearer was completely protected from attacks of these kinds while wearing a horned ring .</p>
<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
