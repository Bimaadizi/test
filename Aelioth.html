<p>Master Aelioth , sometimes misspelled as Aeolith , was an ambitious Red Wizard and necromancer of Thay , who served Valindra Shadowmantle during her mission to the Dragonbone Vale of the Sword Mountains in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, Master Aelioth joined Valindra Shadowmantle in her quest that led the Red Wizards to be allied with the Cult of the Dragon . He traveled to the Dragonbone Vale, driven by the ambition to escalate his station in Thay. The wizard used his necromantic knowledge to develop the malignant conduit that served to spread foul magic and siphon energy of the living into the Netherese mythallar , corrupted by Valindra and her Cult of the Dragon allies. Master Aelioth's malignant conduits empowered the said Scaleblight Mythallar , allowing Valindra Shadowmantle to create a fully-powered mythal over the Scaleblight Summit . Aelioth, however, planned to betray Valindra and the Cult of the Dragon, taking control of the mythal and creating a new center of Thayan power, eventually overpowering zulkirs Szass Tam and Valindra.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the creation of the mythal was thwarted by adventurers from Neverwinter , Elminster , and the alliance of the Sword Coast factions. Master Aelioth himself was defeated and possibly killed in the process.</p>
