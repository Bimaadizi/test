<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR , the great red dragon Klauth had discovered that the ordning of the giants was broken by Annam . Klauth was intrigued but also worried about human civilization of the North . So the dragon summoned a cultist group led by Delsephine and ordered them to build an airship to go to the Eye of the All-Father shrine to help an adventuring party he had detected there. Delsephine followed all Klauth's orders without questions.</p>
