<p>The Wandering Emporium was a traveling bazaar of merchants, creatives, and miscreants that wandered the infernal realm of Avernus in the Nine Hells . The master of this marketplace was the rakshasa Mahadi , a servant of the devilish god Asmodeus .</p>
<p>The emporium was a welcoming place in the otherwise perilous and horrifying plane of Avernus. It was considered neutral ground that offered respite from the hell's many conflicts, most predominantly the Blood War .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The emporium traveled across Avernus using nine massive infernal war machines . When Mahadi chose, the monstrous vehicles came to a halt and formed a semi-circular perimeter. Within this makeshift barricade the market's vividly-colored tents were thrown up and the emporium opened for business.</p>
<p>It was illuminated by dangling lights, emanated exotic scents, and featured rhythmic music that drew in nearby denizens and travelers.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The emporium had no permanent location in Avernus, but wandered around under the direction of its master.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>First and foremost, Mahadi used the emporium as a means to gather souls for his master Asmodeus. The rakshasa did this by presenting mortals with an infernal contract that had to be willingly signed. The contract granted them a boon, such as a powerful magical item or the resurrection of a loved one, in exchange for their eternal soul.</p>
<p>To fulfil this duty and complete his deals, Mahadi was allowed to openly travel between Avernus and the Prime Material plane . While in Avernus, the merchants of the emporium offered various items for sale, such as hellish arms and armaments, demon ichor ; yugoloth larvae; a devilish courier service; currency exchange for soul coins ; and even a barber's run by a Calishite woman named Burney .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The emporium was occupied by the merchants who peddled their goods and services within, along with the devilish drivers who piloted its infernal war machines. Nearly all of them were indentured to Mahadi in some manner or another.</p>
