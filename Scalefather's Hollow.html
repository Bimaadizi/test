<p>Scalefather's Hollow was a winding cave found within the Vilebog swamp on Pirates' Skyhold .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The hollow comprised a natural cave formation whose tunnels were added onto by non-naturally-occurring influences. Wooden support beams could be found alongside the cave's moss -covered walls just as often as massive tree roots that extended underground from the swamp above.</p>
<p>The ceilings of the cave had many openings, allowing streams of water to trickle down from the wetlands, pooling within the cavern floor. A scant few of these holes allowed for columns of light to shine within, providing limited illumination in certain areas.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It was located in the southwest stretch of Vilebog, just west of the crash site of the Magister's Hope skyship .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Scalefather's Hollow was raided by the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , while under the employ of Company Yargo mercenary group.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The cave was named after the Scalefather , the shaman of the lizardfolk tribe that made their home within Vilebog swamp.</p>
