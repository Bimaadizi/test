<p>Oman's Isle , also known as simply Oman , was an island in the Sea of Moonshae within the middle of the Moonshae Isles . It was the heart of the kingdom of Oman prior to the 15 th century DR , after which it was ruled by giants .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Isle itself was peaceful and lovely, but made extremely dangerous by the giants who claimed it as their own and would hurl rocks at passing ships . Its shores were rocky.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Oman was a vaguely triangular island, with three major geographical features: the Old Stone Wood that lay along the east side of the island, the Grampalt Highlands that made up the southern part, and the Iron Bay that was located in the north. The seas around the island were rough, making the shielded waters of Iron Bay an ideal anchorage.</p>
<p>Oman's Isle was largely bordered by the Sea of Moonshae to the north and east, while the Strait of Oman separated it from Gwynneth and the southern portion of Oman in the south.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>The island supported large herds of cattle , goats , horses , sheep , and swine and was suited to the growing of barley , potatos , and wheat .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Northlander realm of Oman was the mightiest of the Northlander kingdoms during its height in the 14 th century DR.</p>
<p>Some time in the early years of the second half of the 14th century DR, Grond Peaksmasher escaped his glacial prison (where he had been imprisoned since circa −5000 DR after a war with the dwarves of the Moonshaes) and brought firbolgs back to Oman's Isle, long absent since the invasion of the Northlanders, having retreated to the mountains of Gwynneth. Moonshae firbolgs had degenerated into corrupted evil beasts, but under Grond's guidance, they began to both culturally and physically resemble their more peaceful mainland cousins.</p>
<p>Following the creation of the United Moonshae Isles in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , the Northlanders of Oman's Isle welcomed Ffolk settlers.</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR a group of fomorians from the Feywild , under the command of the evil Queen Connomae of Vor Thomil , invaded Oman through a gate in the Grampalt Highlands . Together with malevolent native giants, they conquered the island, slaughtered its inhabitants, and toppled Iron Keep by Midsummer of that year. They subsequently thwarted any attempts to retake the island, and in the decades that followed, Oman's Isle was known as a giant-ruled wilderness and the most dangerous of all the Moonshae Isles.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, both King Derid of the Ffolk and Jarl Rault of Norland desired to reclaim Oman for their respective peoples, but the giants of Oman attacked every boat that approached within a stone's throw of the island. Rich seams of gold and iron, as well as the pristine woodlands of Oman were a primary motivator for the re-taking of the island. It was thought that either of them might bestow handsome rewards on any adventurers who could deliver them the Iron Keep.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>It was an idyllic island, populated by firbolgs, fomorians, and other giants, as well as dwarves . The giant demigod Grond Peaksmasher also resided on the island until he was imprisoned in a glacier there.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>There were several major settlements on the island, such as the Iron Keep , Lillemaren , Skien , Trondhelm , and Ramshorn . Other notable locations included the Icepeak and the Oman Moonwell .</p>
<p>The Cairn of Thelgaar Ironhand was said to hold riches and powerful magic and that it had remained undisturbed by the giants occupying Oman, but that it was also well-protected by the bound spirits of animals as well as more mundane traps.</p>
