<p>A periapt of foul rotting was a deadly cursed item.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A periapt of foul rotting resembled a small gem of little value.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Anyone claiming a periapt of foul rotting as their own would contract a terrible form of leprosy , which would slowly degrade their nimbleness, health, and physical appearance; most people died within a couple of months, determined by which attribute was weakest.</p>
<p>There were few ways of countering it: by using both remove curse and cure disease in quick succession followed by a heal , miracle , limited wish or wish , or by crushing a periapt of health and sprinkling it over the affected party. Even those who managed to revert the effect would find themselves permanently crippled and disfigured by it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A number of periapts of foul rotting were recovered from the Imaskari city of Solon , one of which was sent to Princess Tsenya Bhrokiti of Saikhoi as one of her bridal gifts in 1360 DR . There were cups in the Solonese level of the excavations underneath Solon, which had the same effect if someone were to drink from them; they were available until 1360 DR as well.</p>
<p>One was still hidden within the Temple of Set within the Oasis of the White Palm as of 1356 DR .</p>
