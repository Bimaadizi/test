<p>Lurks were a martial form of psionics user, driven by a personal code of ethics that directed how they used their powers, who channeled their control of the Invisible Art towards augmenting their weaponstrikes and becoming masters of stealth.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Across the Realms, lurks were comparatively far fewer in number than the more common psionic pathways of the psion , psychic warrior , soulknife , and wilder . In some respects, the talent necessary to become one was comparable to that of a psychic warrior, but whereas warriors focused their efforts on training the body and augmenting martial prowess, lurks focused on their capacity for staying hidden and avoiding detection.</p>
<p>Every individual lurk followed some form of personal code. Some dedicated themselves to serving the good, some were focused only on their own self-interests, and some were intertwined with the dictates of a heavily religious lurk's deity .</p>
<p>Lurks never killed indiscriminately. Based on their personal code, they sought out to find and remove certain people from the world, such as instances of true evil or those who opposed the truths of their religion. Some simply worked on commission, using the advantages afforded to them by psionics to forge careers as deadly assassins or information brokers.</p>
<p>While lurks were equally as likely to come from any of the psionically-inclined sentient races of Toril , they were found to be most prevalent among dwarves and rare among monstrous humanoids .</p>
<h3>Alignment</h3>
<p>The alignment of a lurk could fall anywhere within the spectrum, though most tended towards a lawful outlook, and wherever they fell was reflected upon by their personal code.</p>
<h3>Regions</h3>
<p>The more criminally inclined of could commonly be found in congregating in major cities, particularly around any area that a significant thieves' guild , as they inevitably dominated and grew bored of the underground trade in smaller urban centers. In the late 14 th century DR , a small thieves' guild of dwarven lurks called the Knights of the Wall operated in the Great Rift , doing seedy business beneath the notice of the Steel Shields of Eartheart . And the city of Gracklstugh was home to the Gray Ghosts , a thieves' guild made up of duergar and derro lurks, psions, and psychic warriors.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Lurks were amiable to working with all manner of spellcasters, warriors , or psionics users so long as they didn't interfere with their personal code. They particularly an appreciation towards healers and those who could serve as a front-line offender.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>In terms of psionic powers, lurks commonly chose those that helped them to evade harm or detection, such as chameleon power , defensive precognition , or evade burst . They were typically skilled in the arts of autohypnosis and psicraft , as well as the use of psionic items . And their understanding of the Invisible Art uniquely granted lurks the ability to instill their weapon strikes with a number of temporary psionic augmentations. Over time, lurks honed their skills to the point they could use two or even three augmentations at a time. These augmentations included some of the following:</p>
<p>When maintaining a psionic focus, a lurk could channel their power of the Invisible Art to pinpoint the vital spots on a target that would allow the lurk to inflict greater harm. Some lurks neglected this in favor of other psionic abilities, such as infusing their weapon strikes with psionic energy. The most skilled of lurks could occasionally evade being affected by enchantment spells.</p>
<p>When it came to combat, lurks preferred to operate in a manner similar to rogues – skulking about an area, waiting for the right opportunity to strike or turn to their advantage, and rarely being the ones to initiate a fight. They remained more interested in supporting teammates by harassing their enemies – and slipping around to sneak attack – than in standing up to an opponent directly, as reflected in their preference for light armors . As their skills in the Invisible Art grew over time, lurks would make distinct combinations of augmentations tailored towards their enemies.</p>
