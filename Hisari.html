<p>Hisari was an ancient, ruined sarrukh city in Chult , that was later taken over by their descendants, the yuan-ti .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hisari was a grand city, comprising numerous golden-domed structures made of white-washed bricks. Elevated roads and walkways allowed for travel and conveyance throughout its winding streets. Buildings in the city were decorated with elaborate mosaics, depicting the subjugation of various peoples at the hands of the sarrukh and other serpentfolk .</p>
<p>The city was built above the jungle floor, but in its history was pulled into an underground cavern, and overgrown with vines and other vegetation. While it remained whole and intact, only the dome of its grand palace remained visible from the canopy of the Chultan jungle.</p>
<p>Hisari was protected powerful magical ward that repelled yuan-ti from entering within.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The city stood at the base of The Crown , the great volcano of the Sky Lizard Mountains , in a great basin in the jungle. Four massive waterfalls flowed into the basin, at each of the cardinal directions.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The city was inhabited by yuan-ti , many of whom relocated to Omu at some point.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time during the late 14 th century, around the time of the Spellplague , Hisari was swallowed into the earth beneath Chult.</p>
<p>Around half a century later, a brood of yuan-ti relocated from Hisari to the lost, Forbidden City of Omu , to freely worship their goddess, Dendar the Night Serpent. Packs of niferns still roamed the city's streets even after the yuan-ti left.</p>
<p>Decades later, in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , a group of adventurers led by Harp Levesque broke into the palace of Hisari, slew its guardian, and stole the artifact safeguarded within.</p>
