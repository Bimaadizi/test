<p>Sister Inessa was an undead nurse who worked alongside Malus Thorm , a servant of the goddess Shar , of the House of Healing in the town of Reithwin throughout the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sister Inessa lived in the town of Reithwin in the Western Heartlands before its fall sometime before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR . During that time, Inessa and other nurses performed healing and other medical procedures in Reithwin's House of Healing. The nurses entertained themselves by making wagers on what sorts of foreign objects they would extract after being lodged in their patients' backside orifice.</p>
<p>At some point during the town's fall into dark worship of Shar or after the Shadow-cursed Lands consumed Reithwin in the late 14 th century DR, Sister Inessa perished and was changed by the dark Shadowfell magic. As of the late 15 th century DR, Malus Thorm and his nurses operated out of the House of Healing in the Shadow-cursed lands. They spent their unlives "experimenting" on innocents that either wandered, or were brought against their will, into his hospital. Malus attempted to teach his Sisters the finer arts of what he called surgery but was ultimately unsuccessful. Sister Inessa's undead form was slain by the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , her body unmoving in the House of Healing's operating theater.</p>
