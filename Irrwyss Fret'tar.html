<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Irrwyss and her friend Kelgoth Darksong joined the Elves of Cormanthor in their mission to reclaim Myth Drannor , as Kelgoth believed that he had located the key to the mythal . While they stayed at the fortified camp outside the city, Kelgoth tried to get assistance from the surfacer elves for his mission, but wasn't successful. Unwilling to wait, Kelgoth headed into the ruins on his own and vanished, leaving Irrwyss behind. As a loyal friend, Irrwyss was near-frantic with worry and frustration and took it out on the camp's security officer, Emalline Brightbough , who tried to calm her down to little effect.</p>
