<p>Jasuka was the capital of the province of the same name in Wa and the second-largest city on the Fochu Peninsula . It was a city that most of the nation of Wa found unimportant and ignored. However, it was notable for the sport of wrestling.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Jasuga was the largest city in its province, but the province itself was Wa's most desolate; the soil was very sandy, which made farming difficult, and it produced very few resources. The citizens of Jasuga survived by the trades of fishing and weaving.</p>
<p>Like many cities of Wa, Jasuga was not welcoming to strangers in its gates, and its people were highly religious.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Jasuga was located on the west coast of the island of Tsukishima , in the northern portion of the Fochu Peninsula and at the end of the Hisano Road from Fochu . The city sat on the Nanaichi River . East of the city was the Jufosu Range . A trail led north to the village of Sukyo .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The daimyo of the city in Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR) was Nobu Subari . He was not a very successful daimyo, but he was made a noble to fulfill a promise made to his mother by the shogun . He was an avid athletics fan who promoted the sport of wrestling in his city.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Jasuga maintained a small militia composed primarily of bushi . The city itself was surrounded by a 50‑foot-high (15‑meter) stone wall with guards posted on the wall every 100 feet (30 meters). The guards on the walls were armed with chu-ko-nu and leaf-headed arrows and wore whistles around their necks with which to summon reinforcements. Guards on foot were armed with katanas .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The city had a suitable amount of trade with other cities of Wa, and just about anything found in other Kara-Turan cities could also be found there, sold mainly from a central market, but these goods tended to cost about double what they would in other places.</p>
<p>To enter the city required the proving of one's faith and the purchase of a visitor's pass at a cost of 1 yuan per person.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jasuga hosted an annual wrestling competition, held on the holiday of the Ox Festival , but the citizens trained for the sport throughout the whole year.</p>
