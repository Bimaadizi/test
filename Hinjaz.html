<p>The Hinjaz was a stone formation in Raurin , not tall enough to be mountains, but taller than any other hills. They were impassable from the ground.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The black rock grew too hot, even for the best of climbers, and the wind continuously scoured the stone peaks with sand. The Durpari airlancers' pegasi often used the updrafts created by the excessive heat to gain altitude around the Hinjaz.</p>
