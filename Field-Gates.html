<p>The Field-Gates were the westernmost fortified gates of Suzail , the capital city of Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Field-Gates stood on the road that stretched from the city's open-air market plaza , westwards, past Suzail's burial garden of the Fields of the Dead , and towards the Storm Horns .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Nightly, the Field-Gates allowed passage of Suzail's dung -loaded carts, hauled by Sundarl Nightsoils all through the night. The carts' destination was almost two miles outside the city walls â€“ a fertilizer field and a lime pit for disposal of Suzail's waste.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Just like the Eastgate , the Field-Gates were citadel-like fortifications that offered solid defenses to Suzail's west entrance. The gates were guarded by a garrison of the Purple Dragons and its gatehouse maintained a detailed log of known spies and other individuals banned from entering the capital of Cormyr.</p>
