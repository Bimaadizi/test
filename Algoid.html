<p>Algoids ( pronounced : /ˈ æ l g ɔɪ d / ÆL-goyd ) were colonial forms of algae that took a humanoid shape.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The humanoid shapes that algoids took were noted as having coarse and rough features.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>These creatures possessed only a rudimentary form of intelligence.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Algoids had the ability to animate certain especially hydrophilic trees, including cypresses , water-oaks , and willows . This ability was similar to that of a treant and they could control up to two trees in this manner. In addition, once per day they could unleash a mind blast .</p>
<p>Algoids were immune to most forms of psionic attack, as well as the effects of fireball . They were particularly vulnerable to the spells lower water and part water . Edged weaponry would pass right through their bodies unless they had an enchantment of +2 or greater .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Besides their mind blast and ability to control hydrophilic trees, algoids fought their opponents by beating them with the fists of their humanoid forms.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ranging as far back as the days of Netheril , Moanderites strove to spread algoids throughout Toril , and the creatures sometimes directly served the Darkbringer themselves.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , the Mouth of Moander, Mogion , controlled a pair of fiercely loyal algoids using a ring of plant control .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Being plants, algoids employed photosynthesis to generate energy, and a lack of natural light could "starve" one in mere days. An algoid suffering from light deprivation gradually turned entirely black as they died.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>These creatures were typically found near swamps or lakeside pastures. In the nation of Sembia , they were rumored to lurk within the sewers of Selgaunt .</p>
<h3>Usages</h3>
<p>The light-starved black corpses of algoids were valued by priests and alchemists for the manufacture of salves and reducing gold ore.</p>
