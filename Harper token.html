<p>A Harper token was a small brooch, ring, belt buckle, or other such item that was typically made of silver or, less frequently, gold . It was often embossed with the symbol of the Harpers , or more simply the image of a tree or musical note. Regardless of its form, Harper tokens were used to identify members of "Those who Harp". When a token came in contact with a Harper pin the wearer of the pin could identify the token as being valid, or a fraudulent copy.</p>
