<p>Ilztoj A'Qaran was a drow mage in Cormanthor in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ilztoj lived in Szith Morcane until it fell to fiendish fire giants circa 1486 DR . He, along with seven companions, followed Drava T'syrr to Cormanthor. There, however, Drava fell under the madness of the demon lord Graz'zt and started to dance and drink.</p>
<p>Some adventurers (members of the Harpers hired by Elanil Elassidil to bring peace to her ancestor Meira Faerenduil ) tried to convince Drava and her companions to go to a refugee camp, but she never complied and in the end she was defeated. Ilztoj became the new leader and agreed to the adventurers' proposal.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Ilztoj managed to resist the madness. However, he also started to like living in the forest. He continued to honor the drow social rules and followed Drava, who as a female was in a higher position than him.</p>
<h2>Relationship</h2>
<p>Ilztoj was always at Drava's side as her second-in-command.</p>
