<p>In the late 1490s DR, Kimathi was a spectator at the revived High Sun Games held at the Neverwinter arena . He was one of the many who noticed the dark tendrils creeping down from the sky as Sofina invoked the horn of beckoning death , and remarked on it to the woman sitting beside him. He likely left with the rest of the audience, following a trail of treasure falling from a hot-air balloon .</p>
