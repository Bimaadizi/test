<p>The Mercykiller's belt was a unique enchanted belt once worn by the factol Dom of Sigil circa the early 10 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Mercykiller's belt was a thick and wide leather belt crafted using the hide of a creature unknown on Toril . It was bound in polished copper strips. The belt front center was decorated with a circle of polished cream-colored malachite carved into an emblem showing a winged serpent with its maw open and fangs facing outward – the symbol of the Mercykillers. The malachite was affixed in place with copper loops running between layers of the alien hide. The belt buckled in the back with hefty steel clasps.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Mercykiller's belt significantly boosted the wearer's physical strength.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sages discovered the mysterious belt's history stretching all the way to the Year of the Sudden Journey, 912 DR . It was created circa that year in the extra-planar city of Sigil to be worn by factol Dom, a Prison warden for the Mercykillers faction. Dom gained infamy after being a part of the Great Break event organized by the Free League of Sigil – the only mass Prison break in the penitentiary's long history. The factol was held responsible for the grand failure, stripped of his rank, and convicted to spend five years in the very same Prison. After release, Dom spent thirty years tracking down all escapees and bringing them to justice.</p>
<p>By the age of sixty-seven, Dom was still on his quest, but the age was taking its toll. The Mercykiller's belt was fashioned to boost the man's failing strength. Three years later, the last of the criminals were brought to justice. Dom reported to the Prison's new warden, filled all the needed paperwork out, and died less than an hour later from exhaustion.</p>
<p>By some unknown means, the Mercykiller's belt found its way to Toril, where, in the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , it belonged to the mind flayer Oinchack'Olp in the Underdark tunnels under the Spine of the World and Icewind Dale . The belt might've been rewarded to a group of mercenaries from Targos , who stood against the Legion of the Chimera in 1312 DR.</p>
