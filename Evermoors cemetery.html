<p>The Evermoors cemetery was a burial ground used by the Uthgardt Elk tribe for the fallen of the Battle of the Evermoors , which was fought circa 1400 DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It lay on the Evermoors in the Savage Frontier , on the battlefield itself, and somewhere south of Nesmé .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was a simple field of roughly hewn stone markers daubed with markings. Each indicated individual graves and coffins.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A century after the battle, in the late 1490s DR, the bodies of these fallen warriors were exhumed by Edgin Darvis , Simon Aumar , Doric , and Holga Kilgore —a member of the Elk tribe herself, so presumably it was not a complete desecration. They used Simon's deathly token to speak with the dead in order to learn the fate of the helmet of disjunction . The eternal rest of Stanhard Grimwulf , Toke Horgath , Sven Salafin , Ven Salafin , and others were all disturbed for the sake of a few questions, mistaken identities, and misused spellcasting.</p>
