<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the late-14 th century DR, Shiala Torthren's expertise was renowned. Her works covered the history and politics of Arrabar in Chondath and compared them to the neighboring Sespech . She warned those who supported Sespechan independence of the impotence of Baron Foesmasher . If the leader of Sespech were to fall, other neighbors would surely feel the "gentle caress" of Arrabar next.</p>
