<p>Thorn was a thief in Ravens Bluff in the Vast in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>One day, Thorn met Legov Nairb , who was living on the streets after being evicted from the family home, and realized his power to control birds with his ring of avian control . Thorn allowed Legov to stay at his house and took a role as his mentor. They began to work together as thieves, using Thorn's skills and Legov's bird-control power to execute some significant thefts and getting rich.</p>
<p>However, Legov tired of thieving after only a year, and started the Raven Express delivery business. Thorn persuaded Legov to use the ravens to smuggle goods as well, and found some thief acquaintances to run branch offices for Legov. Raven Express was active in the 1360s DR .</p>
