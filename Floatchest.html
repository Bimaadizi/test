<p>Floatchests , also called floats , were magic items used to store things.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A floatchest was a storage item like a strongchest, casket, or cargo-box made of stout wood. This was the mundane part of a floatchest . The enchanted parts were flat, dark stones inside the mundane storage's false bottom. These stones were mined from the most faerzress -heavy places and had the power to extend the duration of spells cast on an item to one to four years. The spells in this case were animate objects and levitate .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A floatchest floated in the air. They could be directed by mental command to float in any direction by any person within 30 ft (9 m) who touched the floatchest and said a possibly secret command word . Control was lost if a different person touched the float and said the command word or if the float went outside the range of the spell.</p>
<p>A floatchest could be directed to ram against a target and hit a creature.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The floatchest was a magic item associated with the drow . Within a given drow community, academies, temples, and noble families typically owned one to six floatchests . Merchants who handled dangerous or valuable goods usually owned one to eight when in a caravan and three to twelve when in a community. The floatchest also had a military use: it could be filled with flammables and made to float above enemies and ignited with flaming arrows or spells.</p>
