<p>The Heralds of Imphras II were couriers who carried news to the far corners of Impiltur on behalf of the Lords of Imphras II as of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Heralds were couriers and messengers, who travelled by horseback in bands along Impiltur's major roads, ranging as far as Haelimbrar's Watch . While their primary role was to bring news from Impiltur's major population centers to the outlying villages, the Heralds more broadly served as a line of communication between the rulers and its common folk. They acted as patrols on the roads which they travelled, with each band being led by a veteran fighter empowered to enforce the law.</p>
<p>Whenever the Heralds learned of a newcomer to the realm along one of their roads, they sought them out. The Heralds were always courteous and helpful to new arrivals unless they deemed them to be a threat to the people of Impiltur, in which case they proved formidable foes.</p>
