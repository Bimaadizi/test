<p>The Church of Deneir was a collection of scholarly clerics , monks , and specialty priests called glyphscribes devoted to Deneir , the Lord of All Glyphs and Images.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Members of the Church of Deneir were known as Deneirrath or Deneirians. The term "priest" was used for both male and female members of the church. Ranks within the clergy in ascending order were Applicant, Underpriest, Aspirant Priest, Full Priest, Priest Illuminator, Priest Calligrapher, Priest Editor, Priest Secretary, Priest Librarian, Aspirant Scrivener, Full Scrivener, and High Scrivener. Several even higher titles existed–the Writer Inquisitor, Librarian, and High Librarian–but these were granted by Deneir alone.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>All clergy of Deneir were focused with gathering and copying information. This including all forms such as poetry, music, fiction, diaries, etc.</p>
<h2>Celebrations</h2>
<p>Copies of contracts were shared on every Shieldmeet . Priests of Deneir performed a rite, called the Gilding , where the Words of Deneir were cast upon a levitating scroll one letter at a time.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>Though Deneir's faithful could be found all across Faerûn , some prominent centers of worship included the Master's Library , Edificant Library and subsequent Spirit Soaring , and Twilight Hall .</p>
<h2>Dogma</h2>
<p>Scholars of Denier believed that any piece of information that was not recorded would eventually be lost. Destroying lore in any form should be punished based upon the inherent value of the information destroyed. All information should be free to any who desire it. Literacy, considered a gift from Deneir, should be spread and taught everywhere. Scribes of Deneir took oaths of charity so that they could not refuse a request to perform such duties when asked.</p>
<h2>Orders</h2>
<p>Several monastic orders and adventuring groups were devoted to Deneir including the Literate Brotherhood , Preservers of the Ordered Way , Disciples of the Free Word , and the Zealots of the Written Word .</p>
