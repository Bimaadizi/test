<p>Magurk was a male human fighter in the town of Thunderstone in Cormyr in the late 1360s DR . A former soldier of the Purple Dragons , Magurk was proprietor of the store called One-Armed Magurk's .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was a shrewd dealer, and one could not take advantage of him.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Impressively, Magurk owned a +3 vorpal short sword , which he kept under the counter.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After he lost his arm in battle, Magurk retired from the Purple Dragons and opened up his shop, buying and selling — no questions asked — goods looted by adventurers from ruins and dungeons found around Thunderstone. As Magurk was a former soldier of the Purple Dragons, the local contingent kept an eye on him and his store to make sure nothing bad happened to him.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the Wolfmasters adventuring company stopped at Magurk's store seeking potions that could somehow control black dragons before they ventured into the Vast Swamp in search of Orvaskyte Keep . However, Magurk had no such thing, and came to despise the obnoxious Sembite adventurers and their excessive haggling.</p>
