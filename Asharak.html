<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Elturel was pulled down to Avernus in the Nine Hells and all its tiefling residents were expelled from the city upon its return to Faer√ªn . Asharak was among the group led by Zevlor, which traveled west for Baldur's Gate , but was forced to take shelter from goblin raids at the Emerald Grove near the River Chionthar .</p>
<p>Asharak spent some of his time training the tiefling community's children, such as Gan , Umi , and Ide , in basic combat skills. He beckoned local adventurers, like Wyll the Blade of Frontiers to help bolster the children's spirits and give them a fighting chance on the harsh road ahead of them.</p>
