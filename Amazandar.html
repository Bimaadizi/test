<p>Amazandar , also known as the City of Gems was the capital of the Lost Kingdom of Anauria .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Amazandar was located west of the Desertsmouth Mountains , due west of the peak Rausrawna , known as Mount Shaddath to the Anaurian people, southwest of Anauril , the City of Swords.</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>The city lay above rich veins of gems that could be reached by numerous deep shafts and tunnels.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>As the capital of Anauria, Amazandar dominated trade between Anauria, and the other survivor-states of ancient Netheril , Asram , and Hlondath .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The city was founded about the same year as Netheril's fall in −339 DR . It would eventually have to contend with the encroaching Anauroch desert .</p>
<p>In the Year of Fallen Guards, 111 DR , pressures from the encroaching desert combined with large raids of goblins led by the orc shaman Andegril the Wise , caused the collapse of the kingdom of Anauria. Its survivors melted away into the surrounding kingdoms, melded into nomadic tribes or perished in the harsh conditions .</p>
<h2>Rumors and Legends</h2>
<p>A crypt system beneath a temple of Jergal in the city was said to house the fabulous tomb of King Thausimbel the Wise and his daughter, Queen Shaddara the Fair . In fact this underground tomb system merely held a portal that linked to a nexus beneath another false Thardresk Crypt beneath what would later be called the Serpent Hills . .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , over a thousand years after the fall of Anuaria, the gem mines beneath Amazandar were inhabited by the phaerimm of the Buried Realms .</p>
