<p>Ishira was a human girl of Thay in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As Xenk Yendar would recall, in the mid-1370s DR, Szass Tam , the Zulkir of Necromancy of Thay, called all the other zulkirs and all the people of Thaymount, including Ishira and Xenk, to a grand celebration atop the Citadel on the eve of the summer solstice . A few of the common people carried sun symbols. But it was all a lieâ€”instead, Szass demanded all Thayans abandon their mortality and serve him in undeath. Then Szass used the horn of beckoning death that consumed their souls, thereby creating an army of undead under his control for his coup and conquest of Thay. All who tried to flee were slain. Ishira was left standing alone and lost in the panic, and Xenk remembering see before she was lost in the killing smoke, likely to be killed and turned into a zombie .</p>
