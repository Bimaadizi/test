<p>Bustards was a complex but heavenly delicious dish, according to Volothamp Geddarm , that was cooked with freshly-caught ground quails of the Evermoors . The restaurant of note that served bustards was the Maid of the Moors of Mornbryn's Shield .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bustards usually included two birds on a platter with various garnishes, but the preparation of the dish was noteworthy.</p>
<p>The first step of the dish's preparation was butchering fresh quails, removed heads, guts, and claws. The birds then were smothered in clay and baked on the open fire until the clay hardened. The clay coverings then were cracked and peeled off along with the feathers. The birds then were transferred into covered pots , placed in a hot freshly made gravy of quail eggs , beef fat, stock from steamed cabbage , and asparagus (both grew in abundance in the moors), with flour added as a thickener. The birds were slowly cooked in this silky sauce.</p>
<p>When cooked, bustards were served in the resulting thick gravy, with fried flatbreads for dipping.</p>
