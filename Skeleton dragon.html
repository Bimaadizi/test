<p>Skeleton dragon s were undead dragons that had been raised as undead, reanimating their bones. They retained no hint of their sapience.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They looked like the skeletons of the dragons from which they were created. Later accounts claimed they did in fact have a glow to their eyes.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Skeleton dragons largely acted as directed by their creators, though they only obeyed relatively simple instructions.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>These dragons lacked their own spellcasting, save for innate spells common to all dragons of their kind, had no breath weapon, and did not project a fear aura. However, they gained common undead immunities; furthermore, skeletons took twice as long to destroy with slashing weapons.</p>
<p>Per later accounts, dragons which were frightening even without supernatural influence, and so retained such capabilities, while losing all supernatural powers, though they became pretty good at responding quickly to foes' movements.</p>
<h2>Construction</h2>
<p>The creation of a skeleton dragon required about six-tenths of the skeleton, with only the spine, skull and claws being indispensable. A special elixir had to be made with the remains from an existing skeleton , and the whole process of animation took three days. It only worked on malevolent dragons of at least young age, and even then, it failed sometimes, more often the stronger the dragon was, requiring the necromancer to start over.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sammaster devised the process of creation for skeleton dragons while devising dracolichdom , in the early 10 th century DR .</p>
<p>In 1370 DR , the blue dragon Oskurouh had been placed in the ruined Temple of the Dragon Oracle after being reanimated.</p>
<p>After Esvele Greycloak 's conquest of Shadowdale , she raised Gormauthator 's remains, wrenching them free from the Twisted Tower , and set them to guard Aumry's Tomb .</p>
<p>By 1374 DR , Lady Farkattle , advisor to the hobgoblin king Kardobbik of the Giantspire Mountains had managed to animate the skeleton of a very old deep dragon , and used it to keep the hobgoblins of Giantspire in line.</p>
<p>In 1479 DR , Icingdeath had been raised as a skeletal version of himself.</p>
