<p>Daelan Red Tiger was a male half-orc barbarian raised by the Uthgardt Red Tiger tribe . He was an honorable warrior out to prove himself in the world, hoping to amend for his father's orc blood, and to end the exile by his tribe. He carried a spectacular double-axe and also had a longbow for a ranged weapon. When the Wailing Death struck Neverwinter in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Daelan offered his services to the Hero of Neverwinter to investigate the plague.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to Sharwyn , after his adventures in Neverwinter and Waterdeep , Daelan rejoined his tribe and headed north. After his return to the tribe following the Luskan - Neverwinter war of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Daelan sought to forge a blade that could match his skill and power. He worked tirelessly until he collapsed by the forge exhausted. When the half-orc woke up, instead of one two-bladed sword , he found ten. Daelan praised his deity and handed the swords out to the warrior members of his tribe. With time, some warriors who wielded Daelan's blades left the tribe or fell in battle. Only several of these weapons made it back to the Uthgardt.</p>
