<p>A starblade was a sword. To Kiril Duskmourn 's recollection, Nangulis , a star elf from Sildëyuir , wielded one. She considered such weapons to be more useful than daggers when confronted with incorporeal enemies, and on the same level as flame tongue swords: she also thought to get one at some point.</p>
