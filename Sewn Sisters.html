<p>The Sewn Sisters were a coven of three night hags loyal to Acererak . They were formed sometime in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The coven consisted of three night hags:</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The hags worked with Acererak to nurture and protect the atropal in the Tomb of the Nine Gods until it grew into a death god. They were tempted by all the souls they would obtain.</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>When adventurers came close to the ruined city of Omu , the hags would haunt their nightmares and steal blood, hair, or other forms of organic matter to clone them. After this, they would interrogate and then eat the clone.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The hags based themselves in the Tomb of the Nine Gods in Omu in Chult .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>They owned a scarecrow named Mister Threadneedle made of blood and hair, which held the coven's hag eye . They also owned three dolls infused with the souls of dead children. Peggy Deadbells owned a black orb that could be used to exit the tomb once at the end of the tomb.</p>
<p>The Sewn Sisters were one of the few individuals who knew the true name of Mr. Fox , the arcanaloth and guardian of Acererak's library of lore. Only once one of the hags remained living would she reveal Mr. Fox's true name.</p>
