<p>Chief Vardun was a stone giant who rose to power as in 1366 DR as the grand ruler of all the stone giant tribes throughout the Ice Spires .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Like many stone giants, Vardun was noted for being curious.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>During his reign Vardun often performed experimental carvings upon the flesh of his subjects and sought to destroy that which he considered beautiful - an act he considered to be a form of art. He did this in hopes of uncovering the secrets behind the friezes of the Dour Fissure .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time prior to Vardun rising to the position of chieftain in 1366 DR, he went exploring in the western region of the Spires in hopes of finding new truths to inscribe upon the sacred Living Cave . While doing so he stumbled upon the Dour Fissure. There he gazed upon intricate friezes , carved by the fissure's resident ogres , and the demonic magical energies that emanated from them corrupted his mind. He grew convinced that they concealed a horrifying truth and his mind became increasingly obsessed with contemplating their secret.</p>
<p>When he became chieftain, Vardun was the youngest stone giant to ever hold that position in their society. The early stages of his reign were marked by bold innovations in the field of art and significant progress on the Living Cave's walls. But eventually, his kingdom was wracked with a series of strange mutilations and acts of desecration, that unbeknownst to his cities was Vardun's own doing.</p>
<p>Eventually, Vardun managed to tempt other stone giants to follow him down his corrupt path. He held secret meetings with them at midnight, within the deepest recesses of the Living Cave.</p>
