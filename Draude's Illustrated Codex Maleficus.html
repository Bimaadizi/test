<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This book was imbued with vile and evil enchantments . This magic allowed the owner of the book to cast the repulsion spell four times a day and increased their reaction in battle. However this power came at a price as the Codex Maleficus drained constitution from its wielder as long as it remained in their possession.</p>
