<p>Merin Falle was a swift and hard-working hin cook of the Yawning Portal in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Kythorn of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Merin was present at the inn along with her fellow cook Frinli Hinkille and the foul-tempered chef. A gaggle of drow assassins emerged from the Yawning Portal's entrance to Undermountain and staged a slaughter of the gathered adventurers. Even though the attackers were repelled back into Undermountain , Merin's worries over a fellow cook under- spiceing dishes started to seem not as dramatic as before.</p>
