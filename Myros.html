<h2>Abilities</h2>

<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As a member of the Thayan mission in Evernight, Myros worked to undermine Netherese activities in the city, and in particular, she targeted the Shadovar ambassador.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the crisis appearance of the Cloaked Ascendancy in Neverwinter, a hero from Neverwinter was directed to Myros for help in accessing the Shard of Night . Myros agreed to help fashion a Key of Night to get the hero inside, but required that they slay the Shadovar ambassador in Evernight, Kaross , and collect her "essence". Myros neglected to tell the hero that slaying Kaross would cause the hungry undead of the city to turn on them.</p>
