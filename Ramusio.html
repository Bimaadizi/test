<p>Ramusio was a boring half-elf warrior inhabiting the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Though he often went adventuring, nothing particularly exciting or dangerous ever happened to Ramusio. He decided to retire from the adventurer 's life and moved to Daggerford where he earned a living sweeping the streets. As fate would have it, he found this line of work far more exciting, especially when he found an enchanted ring one day.</p>
<p>He lived in a house in the southeast section of Daggerford located in between Kaoth Alley and Wall Street near the River Gate .</p>
