<p>A chime of interruption was a type of small magical chime with an effect designed to disrupt spellcasters .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These chimes emitted a moderate aura of evocation magic . After being struck, a chime of interruption would resonate its tone for a period of 3 minutes, during which all spellcasters within 30 feet (9.1 meters) of it would find it difficult, if not impossible, to cast spells that required verbal components . In the hands of a proper bard , the difficulty of resisting this effect increased exponentially with the skills of the bard. Additionally, when played by an elven minstrel these chimes could outright disrupt the casting of any spell, so long as it was one that the minstrel themselves was capable of casting.</p>
<p>Once the resonant tone faded, the user would have to wait 7 minutes before they could strike it again. If struck again before this period of rest concluded, the chime of interruption would produce no sound and the rest period would reset, requiring a full 10 minutes to elapse before it could be activated again.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Crafting a chime of interruption required a spellcaster skilled in crafting wondrous items and the spell shout .</p>
<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
<h2>History</h2>

Over time many adventurers fell victim to the room, leaving behind various magical items. By the year 1358 DR, one of the magic items that could be found in the room's muck was a chime of interruption .</p>
