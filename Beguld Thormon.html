<p>Beguld Thormon was a merchant who lived in Crimmor in Amn in the 14th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Beguld was well respected over a long career, but was murdered by doppelganger sometime in the summer of Year of the Behir, 1342 DR . The doppelganger adopted his identity and carried on his trade.</p>
<p>In a market in Crimmor in the Year of the Boot, 1343 DR , "Beguld Thormon" ran a stall dealing in "treasures for the adventurous". The doppelganger came into the possession of the Tome of Torment —the holiest book of the church of Ilmater . This had been thought lost in the winter when the Graycloak's Wolves adventuring company transporting it was slain—also by doppelgangers. "Beguld" sold the Tome for 20,000 gp to a group of Thayan agents who dealt in a number of criminal enterprises: kidnapping, slavery, smuggling, and the fencing and transport of stolen property. Ilmatari investigators later uncovered the doppelganger's true nature when they tracked down the Tome .</p>
