<p>Talmost Keep was a ruined fortification lying in Ardeep Forest on the Sword Coast North . It was the former royal seat of House Talmost , never reclaimed by its descendants.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Talmost Keep was located just outside the end of Ardeep Forest's northern spur, in the Talmost Lands .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Keep originally lay in the lands of Delimbiyran , and the Talmosts were ennobled in 659 DR . They continued to rule from the Keep as an independent kingdom after the fall of Delimbiyran.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Circling Vulture, 942 DR , drow raiders struck hard along the Sword Coast , with Talmost pillaged and the people enslaved. The royal family fled and resettled in Nimoar's Hold , though they maintained their ownership of their lands. They became officially ennobled in Waterdeep the same year and became one of the leading families of the city.</p>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR , the Keep was a ruin haunted only by the ghosts of people tortured to death by the drow raiders. Occasionally, swarms of fiendish spiders were known to emerge from the ruins' depths to menace the area. Sages believed that they could have been arriving from some portal that connected the ruined keep with a drow temple in the Underdark .</p>
