<p>The mameluks , also known as the slave-kings , were a group of slave-soldiers in the Seventh Age of Calimshan who rose to power after the fall of the Shoon Imperium .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>During the reign of the mameluks, slavery was (naturally) outlawed in Calimshan . They also ended the hunting of wizards by the government that had been the case during the Shoon rule.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The slave-kings ruled Calimshan from Manshaka over a period of four decades. There were 29 mameluk rulers in all.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In general, the Alzhedo term mameluk referred to any slave trained as a warrior. During the Sixth Age of Calimshan , it became common practice for rich nobles to pay for the training of slaves to serve in their and their families' places in the army. These mameluks were thus educated and well-trained in combat. Many mameluks rose to positions of lower or middle officers in the army, and so many understood means of leadership.</p>
<p>After the turmoil from the fall of the Shoon Imperium, three pashas ruled Calimshan for a brief time, until in 533 DR the mameluks easily took control.</p>
<p>The time of the mameluks ended because of a Rage of Dragons in 1018 DR . This event put Calimshan into chaos again and ended its Seventh Age. The Eighth Age of Calimshan began, the mameluks were overthrown, a series of merchant kings became the new rulers, and slavery was reinstated.</p>
