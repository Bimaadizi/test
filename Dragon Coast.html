<p>The Dragon Coast was the name given to the region along southern shore of the Dragonmere , and the lands west of the Sea of Fallen Stars . Its city-states and pirate outposts served as confluence of several great cultures, from the archaic Old Kingdoms to the east, the profitable and deadly lands of the Vilhon Reach to the south, and the progressive and independent realms of the Western Heartlands . It was a place of intrigue and danger, where profit and lucrative opportunities abounded, for adventurers , merchants and criminals alike.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The coast has nearly always been an unrestrained land of free commerce and independent city-states, or as some may say, a places of lawlessness and piracy. The people that called these city-states their homes had little to no sense of greater identity, or national pride, but lived as solitary forces unto themselves.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Dragon Coast encompassed the lands and cities along southern shores of the Dragonmere and the southwestern coast of the Sea of Fallen Stars , from the Cormyrean city of Proskur in the west, to the Ruins of Starmantle in Gulthandor to the east. It was situated between the Western Heartlands to the west, and Turmish and the Vilhon Reach to the east.</p>
<p>According to some scholars the Pirate Isles were considered to be part of the coast, despite being geographically separated by leagues of water.</p>
<h3>Geographical features</h3>
<p>In the western stretch of the Dragon Coast, the Tun River flowed into the Dragonmere, forming the Gritstone Moorlands in between a series of hills north of the Overmoor Trail . Just east of these landmarks were the Castaway Coast and the Skeleton Shore , the two coasts that made up the southern shores of the Dragonmere, the Horse Prairie , along with the northern slopes of the Giant's Run Mountains , and the nearby nameless swamp .</p>
<p>The central area of the coast was highlighted by vast stretches of flatlands and interconnected bodies of water. Rainwater ran down from the Giant's Run peaks to the Lake of the Snake , east along the River Reddan into Redwater lake , before emptying out into the sea. The lands north of these waterways was known as the Bleached Bones Flats , and the diminutive river east of Westgate was called the River Thunn .</p>
<p>A bit further east was the Long Arm Lake , fed by the Wet River ; and to its east, the Gulthmere Forest . The North and South Cedar Rivers river that flowed north along Orbrekh and Orsraun Mountains respectively, through the forest to Starmantle Bay .</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>The wetlands of the coast were home to the red bog flowers . The leaves of these flowers were quite valuable in the illicit drug trade, selling for as much as 300 gp .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Unlike nearby nations that formed from groups similarly-aligned cities, such as Cormyr and Sembia , the powers of the Dragon Coast never came together under a common cause to form a single nation. As such the coast had no centralized governing body, but rather a collection of self-serving city-states.</p>
<p>Most often, the individual city-states were each governed by some form of council of merchants, often of less-reputable dispositions.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The Dragon Coast was known first and foremost as a haven for smugglers and other folks dealing in illicit goods. Those merchants that chose to conduct their business in the region were not the type to cooperate with one another for the greater good, rather only look out for their own interests.</p>
<p>The Trueshield Trading Priakos maintained their headquarters and conducted their business predominantly on the Dragon Coast.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>While there was no shared military force on the Dragon Coast, individual territories or cities were often defended by mercenary groups and those individuals who took it upon themselves to serve as a local protectorate.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thousands of years before the Era of Upheaval , the Dragon Coast was considered to be part of the far-reaching Jhaamdath empire.</p>
<p>Sages of Faerûn differed as to how they believed the Dragon Coast earned its name, more specifically as to which actual dragon inspired the name.</p>
<p>In the 13 th century DR , the king of Westgate Verovan attempted to unite the various factions of the coast, but was assassinated in the Year of the Cockatrice, 1248 DR .</p>
<p>After the waters of the Sea of Fallen Stars dropped dramatically, following the Spellplague in the Year of Three Streams Blooded, 1384 DR , coastal towns like Ilipur and Pros were abandoned and left to ruin.</p>
<p>During the majority of the 15 th century DR, the kingdom of Cormyr embarked upon a campaign of expansionism, taking hold of several towns and cities along the Dragon Coast, including Proskur in the Year of the Golden Mask, 1405 DR , and Teziir sometime later. Westgate managed to remain independent in the face of growing Cormyrean power.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>Referred to by some scholars as the "crossroads of Faerûn the Dragon Coast featured a number of important trade routes and roads, including:</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Dragon Coast attracted a host of cutthroat pirates, secretive associations, criminal organizations, and other groups that operated on the fringes of lawful society. Included among these groups were the Night Masks led by Orbakh , the Fire Knives assassins, and the druids of the Fellowship of the Purple Staff ,</p>
<p>Many tieflings found a home on the Dragon Coast, finding the region to be the place where they could truly thrive, as did small communities of half- aquatic elves .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>According to Dragons of the Dragon Coast , numerous theories existed on the origins of the term "Dragon Coast." The topic was quite contentious, with many passionate supporters of one theory over the others. Despite all the disagreements, all admitted that the name was an apt one, as the Dragon Coast was populated by the highest number of these massive flying beasts, and the region's history recorded many notable wyrms who shaped its past.</p>
<p>Most sages considered the dragon named Kisonraathiisar to be one of the most prominent wyrms of history and the namesake. He was slain by Saldrinar of the Seven Spells in -349 DR . But even that part of the region's history was obfuscated by legends. Some believed that Kisonraathiisar was trapped within an enchanted scepter so that the wielder could conjure Kisonraathiisar's spells at will. In turn, Saldrinar made history by founding the city of Westgate atop his lair and ruling it as the first king. Some historians claimed that the Purple Dragon of Cormyr was the Dragon Coast's inspiration, while others attributed the name to Kuldrak the Many-Taloned , a gargantuan red dragon who laired in the very southern mountains of the Thunder Peaks , long before Thauglor the Purple Dragon hatched. Kuldrak was killed by Rauthstokh "Redbones", a parent of the god-dragon Tchazzar . However, there were other candidates – Arauvrim , a small but vicious fang dragon who preyed on sailors and fishers out at sea, terrorizing for ten bloody years until he was petrified by a powerful shipborne mage and plunged to the bottom of Dragonmere . Another possible candidate was Larithylar , perhaps the most terrifying monster of all. She was known to possess bodies of creatures, including, possibly, possessing one of the dragons listed above, and still being alive as of the late 14 th century DR. Larithylar, also known as "the Chameleon Dragon," was a lamia sorceress who learned magical ways of inhabiting human , humanoid , and draconic forms, and even learned to posess and controll powerful true dragon . Larithylar faked her own death centuries before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR and, by some accounts, still inhabited Westgate, seeking powerful magical items for some nefarious plot.</p>
