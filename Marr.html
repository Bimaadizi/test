<h2>Personality</h2>

<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As High Priest at the Temple of Gargauth, Marr led worshipers in evil midnight rituals while wearing black robes and a terrifying mask in the shape of a horned skull.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 1360s DR, some came to suggest that Marr was exaggerating or inventing stories of Gargauth visiting the temple. It was proposed that, in fact, Marr's ineptitude had been resulting in the unintended deaths of followers, and the high priest was trying to cover this up.</p>
