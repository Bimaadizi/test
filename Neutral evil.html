<p>The neutral evil alignment is pure pragmatism without honor and without variation - survival of the ruthless. Neutral evil characters do whatever they can get away with and are completely out for themselves. They show no remorse for those they kill, and have no love of order or law.</p>
<p>They hold no illusion that following laws or traditions would make them better people. On the other hand, they do not seek out conflict and strife like those of the chaotic evil alignment. Yet, some villains of this alignment hold up evil as an ideal and commit malevolent acts for the sake of it, often in service of evil deities or secret societies.</p>
<p>Career criminals, particularly those who harm others for money, such as killers for hire, are the most clear example of neutral evil.</p>
<p>Characters of neutral evil alignment are concerned with getting ahead in life and look out only for themselves. Neutral good characters perform kind deeds without other biases or mitigating factors. These alignments are in direct opposition with one another.</p>
