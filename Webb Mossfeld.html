<p>Webb Mossfeld was a human of the village of West Harbor on the Sword Coast North in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was a brother of Wyl and Ward Mossfeld .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Webb, like his brothers, was a member of the West Harbor militia.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Webb was the bully of West Harbor, who would tease the Kalach-Cha , Bevil Starling and Amie Fern . They were the champions of the Harvest Fair for several years.</p>
<p>During the Harvest Fair in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Webb and his brothers competed in the Harvest Brawl. The Kalach-Cha, Amie, and Bevil, after defeating the Lannon siblings , would've faced Webb, Ward, and Wyl. If the Kalach-Cha, Amie, and Bevil were defeated, they could've asked Merring for a rematch or acknowledged that the Mossfelds had won.</p>
<p>During the attack of bladelings and duergar , the Kalach-Cha could've encountered Webb, who would fight the attackers. Once finished, he could've been asked to go to the field to defend the town.</p>
<p>In the subsequent attack on West Harbor by bladelings and duergar , the Mossfields aided in the defense. The Kalach-Cha, Bevil, and Amie may have encountered Webb fighting the attackers. Once finished, he could've been asked to go to the field to defend the town.</p>
<p>When the Kalach-Cha and companions later returned to the village to reassemble the Sword of Gith , they encountered Ward and his brothers. However, it was an ambush, as they had been slain and transformed into shadows .</p>
