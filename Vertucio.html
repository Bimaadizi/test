<p>Captain Vertucio was a member of the Order of the Sapphire Crescent , the Church of Waukeen 's personal mercenary army, in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Vertucio was a strict commander, fully loyal to the Order and the Church of Waukeen. Even though he was quite fond of Vambran Matrell , he did not allow disobedience.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Captain Vertucio was the commanding officer of Vambran Matrell of the noble merchant House Matrell of Arrabar. Vambran's troops, his two friends, Sergeants Adyan Mercatio and Horial Rohden , as well as their trade vessel the Lady's Favor , were under Captain Vertucio's command. On Tarsakh 13 of 1373 DR, Captain Vertucio was ordered to deploy the entire army of the Sapphire Crescent under orders from the Temple of Waukeen 's Grand Trabbar Lavant . Captain Vertucio turned down Vambran Matrell's requests for personal time despite several requests and the grand celebration of his sister's sixteenth birthday. The deployment orders came as a way of stopping Vambran's investigation into Lavant's corruption and his sneak coin cabal's illicit activities.</p>
<p>To the lieutenant's surprise, he was offered an excuse to delay the deployment under a false pretense. Grolo Firefist covered for Vambran as he attended his sister's birthday celebration, where the cabal's plot rapidly unfolded. As Vambran was gone for a suspiciously long time, Captain Vertucio dispatched a squad of Crescents to rein him in. Unwittingly, the mercenaries aided the ensued struggle. As a result, Vambran Matrell received a disciplinary rebuke from Vertucio. A punishment in symbol only.</p>
