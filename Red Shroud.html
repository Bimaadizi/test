<p>Red Shroud was the succubus sorceress ruler of the Broken Reach , a cast fortress of intrigue and betrayal in Pazunia in the Abyss .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Red Shroud was a beautiful succubus with flame-red hair and pale skin. She had large bat -like wings and her eyes glowed with sinister desire. As a businesswoman, she was capricious and untrustworthy.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Red Shroud was Malcanthet 's daughter and worked with Shami-Amourae to betray and oust her mother. Over the centuries, she birthed thousands of children. Notably, Red Shroud sold her own daughter, the cleric later known as Fall-from-Grace , into baatezu slavery.</p>
<p>Some rumormongers suggested that Red Shroud's consorts had some sway over her, however, that was unconfirmed and likely false. By the late 14 th century DR , she had four consorts since founding Broken Reach. The nalfeshnee named Ygrax the Skullbiter was the last known lover of the succubus's. He was held in line and was fully subservient to Red Shroud, however, it was unknown of it was just an act. At all times, Red Shroud was surrounded by a quartet of hezrou bodyguards. The wispling named Shadowfire was her favorite agent and a secret servant of Demogorgon .</p>
<h2>Posesions</h2>
<p>Red Shroud armed herself with a powerful dagger of venom . She also used iron bands of Bilarro and a shroud of venom in battle.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>She had a reputation of a deadly poisoner and a source of useful information. She enjoyed dealing in poisons and reveled in toying with the prey using slow-acting venoms.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Red Shroud founded Broken Reach more than two hundred years before the late 14 th century DR atop the Plague-Mort portal in the Outlands . She ruled the fortress with a harsh harsh and absolute power. She allowed trade and visitors in her domain as long as they were not foolish enough to cross the succubus ruler. She was powerful and dependable enough to protect Broken Reach from mobs, githzerai , and minor Abyssal lords. Her governing with an iron fist ensure that no violence was allowed within the fortress's walls and the absolute rule applied to the inhabitants and guests alike.</p>
