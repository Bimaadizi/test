<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Tarsakh of 1370 DR , he was running the Harper stronghold during the absence of the severely ill Cylyria Dragonbreast when, under the urging of Bran Skorlsun , Obslin agreed to discuss the evidence that showed Khelben Arunsun was a traitor. The Harpers had discovered that Khelben had been the one who had stolen the Scepter of the Sorcerer-Kings , a powerful Netherese artefact thirteen years before from the Catacombs of Ordulin . This artifact had since ended up in the hands of the Zhentarim .</p>
