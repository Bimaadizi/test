<p>Count Fisfnilt was a noble from Toril , who lived some years before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Count Fisfnilt's name went down in history in association with a ring of human influence . Sometime before the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Count Fisfnilt was attempting to find a "suitable" bride for his son Ewnin , who rejected countless women from across Faerûn for not meeting his standards. After Count grew exhausted with his progeny, he ordered a court wizard to create a ring of human influence . The ring was gifted to a certain woman of great influence in a large nation. Ewnin fell in love with the woman, and they wed three weeks later.</p>
