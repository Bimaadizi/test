<h2>History</h2>
<p>The drow impersonating the trader Inder Dunseltree from Scornubel and his wife Namra Dunseltree in the 1369 DR had purchased some hammerscale roe, which was eaten by the other drow impersonating the drow impersonating Namra, that is, Qilué Veladorn , during the day in which she attempted to infiltrate their clique. She was queasy during the meal; later, the drow impersonating Inder commanded a servant to clear the meal. The servant wondered why the stuff cost its weight in gold; presumably, he did not like it.</p>
