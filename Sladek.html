<p>Sladek the Blue was a genasi wizard in the late 15 th century DR who became infected by the pixelating curse and served Vargo in Cube 1717 . He aimed to spread the pixelating curse to all creatures.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As a genasi, Sladek had blue-colored skin. He wore dark blue robes and a tall cone-shaped hat. While affected by the pixelating curse, Sladek appeared as a blocky mass and his form was difficult to recognize.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As a pixelated creature, Sladek had a limited form of telepathy that allowed him to communicate to other creatures infected by the curse. He also had the special ability to communicate with Vargo from any distance.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Sladek owned a collection of six ioun stones , which increased his awareness, wisdom, intelligence, proficiency, defenses, and stored spells for him. After Sladek's pixelation, Vargo took the stones from him.</p>
<p>Sladek used a large, violet-colored spellbook , a driftglobe , and alchemist's supplies . All of these were thoroughly pixelated. He kept a potion of healing , two potions of climbing , and a scroll of control water in a pixelated chest protected by a glyph of warding that stored the cloudkill spell.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Before he was pixelated, Sladek spent time researching the fields of geology and geography. After his pixelation, Sladek spent much of his time in his room in Cube 1717. There, he researched the pixelating curse through alchemical means. He also spent time in the surgery, where he supported Vargo's efforts to attach new heads to its body.</p>
<p>As Vargo was unable to use one of its heads to control the Six Face Throne , Sladek used his own head to control one-sixth of it for Vargo.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>After becoming pixelated, Sladek became Vargo's second-in-command and was totally loyal to the skull lord. Sladek no longer had any sense of loyalty to those he knew before he became pixelated. Sladek shared control of a pixelated balhannoth with Vargo.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sladek heard of the Changing Island , which had recently appeared in the Sea of Swords . Curious to investigate it, he sailed out to sea on a boat that he hired. On the island, which was really Cube 1717 from Acheron , Sladek was captured and pixelated by the pixelating curse. He entered the service of Vargo.</p>
<p>About a week later, a group of adventurers were hired by Saberhagen to find Sladek and return him to safety or to collect his ioun stones . Unaware of the dangers lurking there, they sailed to the Changing Island to rescue him.</p>
