<h2>History</h2>
<p>Umakai trained under the powerful wu jen Setsu Iki .</p>
<p>In 1357 DR , after years of not seeing him, Setsu arrived in Ikizawa asking Umakai to take care of a page of the fabled Book of Hsi . Setsu explained that the evil Za-Jikku from the Qui demiplane wanted the book but it was safest being split in two, with a page in the far and isolated Ikizawa.</p>
<p>However, in 1358 DR , the yellow-robed minions of Za-Jikku twice attacked the village, greatly scaring Umakai and his villagers.</p>
<p>Later he met Osari Minhiro and a foreign adventuring party. After checking that they were good men, Umakai told them everything and gave them the page of the Book of Hsi.</p>
