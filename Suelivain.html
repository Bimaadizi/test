Unbeknownst to him, however, a rift to the plane later deposited his things in the Halls of Demarch in the city of Tantras in Faer√ªn .</p>
<p>Members of Demarch's Folly found the tome of Suelivain and from it they learned the fundamentals of shadow magic. They tracked down Suelivain and returned his tome and other possessions in exchange for training in the ways of shadow magic.
