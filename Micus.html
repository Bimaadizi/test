<p>Micus was an astral deva servant of Tyr . He was a high-ranking member of the Court of Tyr and one of Tauran 's closest friends.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Micus had close-cropped dark hair.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1373 DR , Micus and Tauran captured Kashada the Nightwraith in Sundabar and imprisoned her in a permanently glowing sphere.</p>
<p>In 1385 DR , when Mystra was killed, magical forces melded Micus with the draconic hobgoblin Myshik Morueme , turning them into a dragon - hobgoblin - deva abomination. Micus-Myshik became insane and was captured by the marilith Vhissilka . When Kaanyr Vhok joined forces with Vhissilka, she gave Vhok a metal cuff to wear that dominated Micus-Myshik; Vhok subsequently used him to taunt Tauran. Micus-Myshik was then slain by Kael , a knight of Torm , after the drow wizard Pharaun Mizzrym was able to trap him in a spell.</p>
