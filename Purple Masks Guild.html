<p>The Purple Masks Guild was a thieves' guild in the city of Iriaebor in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Base</h2>
<p>They operated underneath the High Altar of the Moon , or the “Moontower” as the lay people of the city called it. The entrance to the guild was in one of the prayer boxes inside the temple. After one knocked a secret code on a wooden panel, a panel was opened by one of the members of the guild, revealing a corridor. Following the corridor led down to a long flight of stairs and then through a labyrinthine network of corridors and chambers that spread beneath the entire temple.</p>
<p>The Guild had a secret entrance to the dungeons of the High Tower of Iriaebor .</p>
<h2>Leadership</h2>
<p>Around 1363 DR , its leader was Guildmaster Bock , an enormous man with several chins, dressed in maroon and silver silk, with a pudgy ring-covered hand. Despite his appearance, he was an intelligent man. Bock had asked Jewel Talondim , the head of an independent thief family, to marry him for at least twenty years; she kept saying maybe. He greeted visitors in a lavishly decorated chamber. Many-hued silks hung from the walls, and the floor was strewn with thick rugs and embroidered cushions. Guildmaster Bock usually sat on a heap of pillows in the chamber's center.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Some members of the guild wore a gray outfit and a silken violet mask. Two members of the guild are Kyana , a slender, dark-haired woman with large, catlike eyes; and Talim , a young man with a mop of red hair.</p>
