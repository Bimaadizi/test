<p>Nora and Dora were the cook twins of Thistleflame Manor and servants of Lord Partic Thistle circa 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Nora and Dora were dutiful enough in their work, but they did have a tendency to gossip too much.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The twins were excellent cooks, and handled most of the Manor's meals. They worked alongside Malda , who they wisely prevented from getting involved in anything except boiling.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Like Malda, they found Dom 's histrionic baking style rather tiresome to work around.</p>
