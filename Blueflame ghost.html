<p>Blueflame ghosts were spirits that were imprisoned inside blueflame magic items. Some members of the adventuring group, The Nine , were among the blueflame ghosts.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The term came from the magical blue flames that surrounded such ghosts. The owner of an item containing a blueflame ghost was able to call the spirit forth and force it to do their bidding, which was often to kill someone. At least seven blueflame ghosts were known to exist and there may have been many others.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Larloch created the blueflame items with the help of the Imprisoners by binding the spirits of three liches to the items. Each of the items possessed its own power when the ghost was imprisoned but the power was dormant when the ghost was outside the item. Part of the goddess Mystra's power was bound to the items and the Simbul believed that it may have been possible to bring Mystra back through such items.</p>
