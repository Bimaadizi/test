<p>Clairvoyants were mind flayers who forsook the Prime Material and their race's expected behavior of serving elder brains , instead turning to the Far Realm and the myriad of eldritch entities that whispered within its depths.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like illithid psions , clairvoyants were capable of remarkable feats of psionic power, akin to clairvoyance , detect magic , dispel magic , and mage hand . In addition to theor innate abilities, clairvoyants also displayed extraordinary powers from having peered into thestarless depths of the Far Realm. Typically they could open rifts into that plane , unleashing tentacles that distorted the minds of their foes, and warp reality to teleport attackers 60 feet (18 meters) away. They also hovered above the ground and had slightly greater perception than standard illithids, possessing both darkvision and truesight , though could not perceive the latter as far as their normal senses.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR , a group of mind flayers laired beneath the Sword Coast North that worshiped a godlet in the Far Realm by the name of Ilvaash and were determined to reestablish the Illithid Empire on the Prime Material plane. Having discovered fragments of a black obelisk near the village of Phandalin , they planned to reconstruct it and infuse the obelisk with Ilvaash's energy to transform the citizenry of Phandalin into illithids loyal to Ilvaash, turning their village the seat of a new illithid empire. Among their number were a trio of clairvoyants – Chishinix , Hashutu , and Voalsh – who as their plan was nearing completion entered Ilvaash's Endless Void and traveled to a place therein called the Anima to carry out the ritual.</p>
