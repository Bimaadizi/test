<p>The Wererat's Entrance was the entrance to a semi-secret tunnel network dug beneath Wheloon Prison in Cormyr , built by the wererats of the Riverside Rats gang.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , the Riverside Rats used the tunnel to get in and out of the prison and quietly perform their gang business. The prison officially considered it a part of the infrastructure, thanks to the Rat's agreeableness and bribery. When the Night Brigade overtook the Rats, the Rats used the tunnels to escape and regroup outside the walls while looking for assistance. Though they had been driven out of their hideout, the wererats and their allies were able to use the Wererat's Entrance to access the various tunnels, cellars, and sewers beneath Wheloon , and strike back hard at the Night Brigade.</p>
<p>By passing through the Wererat's Entrance and the adjoining underground tunnels, they were able to get into Agarta's arenas , Darstil's tower , Karissa's hideout , and their old hideout , allowing the final destruction of the Night Brigade gang.</p>
