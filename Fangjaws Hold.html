<p>Fangjaws Hold , also called Fangjaw's Hold , was an ogre stronghold in Thar .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Fangjaws Hold was located in central Thar within a small region of hills just east of the trail connecting Melvaunt to Glister .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Hold was made up of a dozen ogre-sized dwellings made of piled earth and rocks that were surrounded by a wooden wall. It was named for its fearsome gate, which was covered with hundreds of bulette teeth making it look like a fearsome jaw.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>As of the late 14 th century DR , the Hold was home to the Skullsmashers ogre tribe lead by Zar-Umak . The tribe had numerous goblin slaves who served as foot soldiers and watched over a group of human and dwarven slave laborers.</p>
<p>The Hold still stood as of the late 15 th century DR and the Skullsmashers still existed under the leadership of Guld , however it was unclear whether the tribe still inhabited the Hold.</p>
