<p>Wild halflings were halflings native to the jungles of Far Payit in Maztica .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Wild halflings tended to be lean, and had black hair and dark eyes. They spoke their own language, and occasional some Payit as well.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>The wild halflings lived in small tribes in the jungles of Far Payit, separate from the native humans . They had a primitive, hunter-gatherer society, and each tribe is ruled by a chief, who made decisions alone. They also practiced polygamy, with males being free to have as many wives as they could comfortably support. A male could challenge another male for a female.</p>
<p>Each village was completely self-sufficient, and the halflings had no use for trade. Their tendency to kill humans they found in their territory meant that they rarely had visitors.</p>
<h3>Combat</h3>
<p>Wild halflings made a unique, paralyzing poison called kurari which they used on their arrows for hunting and fighting. In addition, they would use knives to dispatch prey and to defend themselves.</p>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>The wild halflings worshiped the Maztican pantheon , honoring Zaltec and Nula the most. They also had a number of superstitions, mostly concerning the intermixing of adult males and married females, and each tribe would revere a talisman. This talisman influenced how they sacrificed people, something they did with any human caught in their territory. For instance, a tribe with a jaguar lord as their talisman would keep the creature in a pit in the village, and sacrifices would be deposited in the pit during an appropriate ceremony.</p>
