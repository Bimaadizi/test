<p>Arambar was one of the primordials who fought against the gods before the sundering of Abeir-Toril .</p>
<h2>Appareance</h2>
<p>Arambar was a gigantic primordial with the size of a mountain and a vaguely humanoid form.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Arambar fought against the gods and was killed during the conflict that took place before the world of Abeir-Toril was divided into two twin worlds, Abeir and Toril , when his dragon mount betrayed him amid the battle and delivered itself the killing blow. Arambar's corpse was left in the world of Abeir after the two worlds were separated, in the continent of Laerakond in the lands that would later will be known as Skelkor . The stones that made its corpse rearranged themselves each night, and some believed the spirit of Arambar was the one who changed the position of the stones as a way to mark the time left for some great event to happen.</p>
<p>Not long after the residual energy from his corpse enveloped Abeir, causing the Steelsky .</p>
<p>Eventually, a group of escaped slaves from Skelkor founded a village in the remains of Arambar named Wandering Stones . Dragons who knew the town was near the resting place of Arambar, shunned the place out of fear.</p>
<p>During the Spellplague , a broken fist of Arambar buried in Ithimir Isle was transported to Toril along with the isle. The genasi of Akan√ªl eventually found its remains and began to mine the rare metal Arambarium from it.</p>
<p>In 1479 DR , the spirit of Arambar briefly awakened to protect the adventuress Jada Marlserpent , the shaman Olothon , and the inhabitants of the Wandering Stones village from the attack of the brown dragon Thovantareth .</p>
