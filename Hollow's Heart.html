<p>Hollow's Heart was the 176 th layer of the Abyss . It was ruled by the demon prince Fraz-Urb'luu .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hollow's Heart was a continent-sized landmass surrounded by fine white powder, all under a starless black sky. Despite this, the ground was lit as brightly as if by a noon sun.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Fraz-Urb'luu was one of the first tanar'ri demon lords to dominate a layer of the Abyss, rising to power in the last days of the obyrith dominion. With the aid of his staff of power , he could raise mountain ranges or drain entire oceans on the layer with but a thought. His mastery over Hollow's Heart meant that his many foes were unable to defeat him.</p>
<p>At one point, the demon prince Demogorgon invaded and seized fully half of Hollow's Heart, and would have taken the other half had he not been forced to return home by the demon lord Zuregurex 's attack on the Gaping Maw .</p>
<p>However, Fraz-Urb'luu's arrogance and habit of humiliating his fellow demon princes eventually led to his downfall, when his erstwhile foes helped a mortal wizard imprison him on the Material Plane for more than 200 years. During the time of Fraz-Urb'luu's imprisonment, demons fought over his layer, destabilizing it. A few managed to carve out islands of their own, but the majority of the layer was ruined.</p>
<p>When Fraz-Urb'luu finally regained his freedom and returned, he found his beloved layer to be little more than endless white powder under an equally empty sky. After driving out the majority of the squatters that had made islands in his absence, he began rebuilding the layer, although without the staff of power it was slow going, and by the late 1480s DR much of it remained white powder.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Hollow's Heart was primarily inhabited by various tanar'ri demons that served Fraz-Urb'luu, such as succubi and skurchurs . A number of chaotic evil rakshasas known as the Hollow Rajahs served as Fraz-Urb'luu's vassals, commanding various settlements and citadels throughout the layer.</p>
<p>Additionally, large numbers of fiendish orcs , ogres , and goblins lived in towns along the coasts of the Hollow Sea, and approximately 6,300 half-elves , dwarves , halflings , half-orcs , and gnomes lived in Karantis.</p>
<p>Fraz-Urb'luu's hatred of humans meant that the only ones living in Hollow's Heart were slaves or prisoners.</p>
