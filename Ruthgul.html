<p>Ruthgul was a swindler in Suzail during the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was grizzled and scarred. During the night in which he tried to climb into Amarune Whitewave 's window, he was wrapped in largely ragged clothes.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was suitably distrustful, though he sometimes complained of the lack of trust.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He had been the one to teach Amarune Whitewave many of her thieving skills, strongly implying he was a talented thief. He climbed to Amarune's window, for instance, one night, which meant he had adequate climbing skills.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Of note, he owned a cart of wine casks .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Besides swindling, he did a little bit of honest living as a wine seller.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Ruthgul had taught Amarune Whitewave much of what she knew about thieving. He was an ongoing associate of hers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Mirtul of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Ruthgul woke up Amarune Whitewave by trying to open her room's shutters from the outside with a knife. She woke up; after recognizing Ruthgul and gathering her weapons, she let him in. He hired her to fake a signature on a document. While she worked, someone else tried to punch through the window: Ruthgul claimed it was the person who asked him for the contract. Amarune helped him escape the building unnoticed.</p>
<p>Later, he was part of Amarune, Storm Silverhand and Arclath Delcastle 's secret escape from the city of Suzail, sneaking them out in his cart loaded with empty wine casks. He did so under some duress as he had not intended to leave the city yet: when he agreed, it with a hand crossbow armed and a small bag of gems as payment, alongside the promise he'd be sworded if he refused.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Manshoon planned on using a corpse that would be enspelled to look like Ruthgul at first, then shift into another's form to throw Amarune off-balance, making her more distrustful, so that she would be less likely to aid Elminster Aumar if he came asking. Amaruen did indeed witness Ruthgul's body changing into that of Gaskur , whom she didn't know, and this did make her more suspicious.</p>
