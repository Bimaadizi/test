<p>Lord Alex was Lady Oonagh 's long time adventuring partner and lover from the Forest of Tethir , active sometime before 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lady Oonagh hailed from a musically-inclined noble elven family, but unlike them, Oonagh had no musical talent and was a particularly awful singer. One year, Lord Alex presented her with a gag birthday gift, the enchanted lute , later known as Lady Oonagh's ludicrously loud lute . Alex found it appropriate that the lute and Oonagh's voice both sounded so terrible and intense, they caused profuse ear bleeding.</p>
