<p>A hyena was a type of pack animal known for its shrewdness and hunting skills and for its disturbing laugh-like call.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hyenas came in different varieties but commonly had stripes on their fur, weighing about 120 pounds (55 kilograms) and measuring a about a yard (meter) in length. Their fur coloration gave them an advantage when hiding within areas of tall grass.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Hyenas fought in packs and were intelligent enough to send some of the members to circle and flank their prey. They were capable of tripping with their sharp jaws.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Gnolls , unsurprisingly, had a strong affinity for hyenas, keeping many as pets or guards. The Mulhorandi god Set also favored hyenas, using them as omens for his followers.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>In the Shining South hyenas were known to be found in and around the Channath Vale , Dambrath , Durpar , Estagund , the Gnollwatch Mountains , the Great Rift , and the Shaar . North of this region, they could be found wandering the Raurin desert.</p>
<h3>Usages</h3>
<p>Hyena ears were valued among alchemists and a single year was valued at 5 gold pieces. Hyena ears were burned into ashes and hyena earwax made the ashes into unpleasant sticky goo. This ash good could be mixed with a special type of alchemical salt to create a potion of speed .</p>
