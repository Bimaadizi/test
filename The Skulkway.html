<p>The Skulkway was a small corner road that was located in the city of Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Skulkway was located in the northwestern section of Waterdeep's Sea Ward . It cut the corner between Westwall Street and the Street of Glances several buildings short of the intersection of the two larger streets.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A single building occupied the Skulkway. The building was actually an empty shell with holes in the wall large enough to allow carts to pass through. A wizard cast illusions to hide the cart openings. The ruse worked until the entire building vanished one day.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The street's name was derived from the fact that it was used to literaly skulk past the City Watch , prompting a stationary watch to be stationed there.</p>
