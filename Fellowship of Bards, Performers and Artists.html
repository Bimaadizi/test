<p>The Fellowship of Bards, Performers and Artists was a guild comprising the bards , actors, musicians, craftsmen, artists, singers, and other performers that operated within the city of Ravens Bluff during the 14 th century DR . Different from a bards' college, the fellowship operated as a true guild, which was uncommon for a Faer√ªnian bardic institution.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The guild earned the majority of its income from ticket sales for performances put on in the playhouse. The theater offered tickets that ranged from 5 cp for bench seats, 1 gp for a balcony view, to 30 gp for the luxury of a private box (a strike of brilliance of Guildmaster O'Lyre). .</p>
<h3>Crafting</h3>
<p>Master Craftsman Randall Morann had his pupils create beautiful musical instruments, which were available for sale to both guild musicians and citizens of Ravens Bluff.</p>
<h3>Performances</h3>
<p>Shows put on by the guild were impressive affairs that transformed their venue into a magical place to be for a night. The theater allowed for a number of experience-enhancing effects, such as a "birdwire" that allowed thespians to be lowered onto the stage (as if they were flying) and iron cages, which held monster-shaped sculptures or near-naked performers, that could be suddenly dropped to jolt any bored or tired audience members out of their seats. Makeshift "lightning" could be created from lamps encased in metal cylinders, often enhanced with overlays that created shadow effects like spider webs over the stage. Many performances were given an arcane touch thanks to the illusory magic of the brilliant and comical special-effects artist Arrion Weatherspoon .</p>
<h2>Locations</h2>
<p>The guild operated out of a guildhall in the Altarside neighborhood, within the Bluff's Temple District . Located right next door was the Ravens Bluff Playhouse , a theater and venue used by guild members to put on performances, such as plays, concerts or other displays to entertain the Ravenian citizens.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>Guild bards were respected and well-appreciated throughout the city. Troubadours and minstrels who were not sanctioned by the fellowship could seldom find a place to perform within the city, as they were believed not be "up to snuff" with their civic-approved contemporaries.</p>
