<p>The Umber Council was a trio of undead druids who led armies of shambling mounds through the Umber Marshes in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Umber Council's base of operations was an expansive network of caves that they had created underneath the Umber Marshes with druidic magic .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Umber Council was formed after Ysvel the Black dug the artifact known as Ironwood from the marsh. It drove her mad and influenced her to kill two other druids who had been her acolytes while they slept. Those druids were raised as juju zombies , and she achieved lichdom .</p>
<p>Pursuing unknown goals, the Umber Council spent months animating armies of shambling mounds from the Umber Marshes. The mounds were sent to form a mile-long (1.6 kilometers) line in the southern part of the marshes. More mounds were sent to form a line against the Watchwall and also to Glarondar . These movements caught the attention of the zulkirs of Thay , including Szass Tam , who planned to control the mounds himself and turn them against Aglarond .</p>
