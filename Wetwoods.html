<p>The Wetwoods , sometimes called the Flooded Forest , was an area of wooded and grazing land south of the Wet River in the Vilhon Reach area.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Two-thirds of the southern area of the Wetwoods was a misty bog with fungus-coated trees.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1372 DR , several animal herders were killed while tending to their herds and flocks, and although none of the animals were harmed, they were left mysteriously weakened. Despite the survival of some of the herders, there were no sightings of any malevolent beings in the area and people speculated the attacks were made by vampires or stirges . Lord Quwen of Ormath ordered an investigation.</p>
