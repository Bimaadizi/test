<p>The Zoar family once were members of the nobility in Waterdeep who lost their status amid a scandal and relocated to Everlund in Luruar in the 14 th century DR , where they became a significantly influential family.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The historic conflict known as the Guildwars concluded in Waterdeep in the Year of the Black Wind, 1262 DR , leaving Ehlemm Zoar of the Gemcutters Guild – one of the two guildmasters to survive. The two – Ehlemm Zoar and Lhorar Gildeggh , soon after declared themselves Two Lords Magister of the City of Splendors. Their rule ended in the Year of the Wagon, 1273 DR in an uproar of Waterdhavian nobility. The rulership of Waterdeep was restructured, and both Lords Magister's families were exiled.</p>
<p>The Zoar family removed themselves from Waterdeep and relocated to Everlund after the scandal that stripped them of nobility. Over the century that followed, they gained political and financial power in Everlund, and by the late 15 th century DR, the Zoar family held a position on Everlund's Council of Elders . Other locales where the Zoars could be found by the mid-14 th century DR were the cities of Luskan , Scornubel , and the nation of Amn . The family considered the rulers of Waterdeep their sworn enemies.</p>
<p>At some point between the Year of the Bloodbird, 1346 DR and the Year of the Harp, 1355 DR , during Tamaeril Bladesemmer 's tenure as a Lord of Waterdeep , a member of the Zoar family was slain by a knight of Waterdeep . That man was the father of Amril Zoar . In the years since, Amril Zoar came to possess a book written by a mage lord Ahghairon on the use of echo gates , capable of bypassing most of the wards in Waterdeep. On early Flamerule of 1355 DR, he resolved to get revenge for his father's death, and using the echo gates . Amril ambushed Piergeiron Paladinson , the Open Lord at the time, and charmed him, finding out the identities of all the Masked Lords of Waterdeep. He then attacked the Open Lord, severely wounding him. Using that information, the murdered ended lives of Masked Lords Resengar and Tamaeril Bladesemmer His attempts on the lives of Mirt the Moneylender , Durnan , and Laeral Silverhand , however, were unsuccessful. Eventually, young Zoar was confronted and defeated by Storm Silverhand , Elminster Aumar , Piergeiron Paladinson, Asper , and Mirt. Before they could kill him, Storm pleaded for them to have mercy on him as he was worthy of becoming a Harper , and swore that she would kill him herself if he returned to his murderous ways.</p>
<p>Sometime before the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , a young girl from the Zoar family brunch that settled in Amn was murdered. Cahorl Krimmevol was framed for the murder by his older brother Lord Jharvex Krimmevol in order to claim his lands.</p>
<p>By the 1480s DR , the Zoar family were among the three leaders and founders of the secret society called the Three-Headed Helm . Andrethra Zoar , a resentful sorceress scion of the outcast family, was one of the three founders.</p>
<p>In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR , Tamalin Zoar became the new owner of the Calling Horns Inn not far from Yartar after retirement. Calling Horns was originally built by the Zoar family to be used as a hunting lodge sometime long before their exile from Waterdeep. Circa the same period of time, the Zoars purchased Danivarr's House in Everlund, a popular inn frequented by adventures.</p>
