<p>The Temple of Time was a temple to Amaunator founded in the ancient Netherese city of Trinity .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The clergy of the Temple of Time had a much more relaxed and non-hierarchical set of doctrines compared to other sects in Netheril . Trinity had been founded by the remnants of three different Amaunatori groups, and in abandoning their theological differences they created a new and unified sect that cared little for the elaborate legalism and bureaucratic systems that were traditional among Amaunatoris.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The temple was built in 3022 NY (−837 DR) after lengthy construction efforts. The onset of the Shadowed Age in 3163 NY (−696 DR) brought with it omens of doom that invaded the dreams of the resident potentates, giving them visions of fires, storms, and darknesss. As the end of Netheril approached, the dreams spread to the wider population of the city, but they refused to leave.</p>
<p>The temple started shining with bright reflected light during the day in 3420 NY (−439 DR) , creating a beacon that was visible for miles away, blinding passersby but also reinforcing the glory of Amaunator. This divine glow abruptly ended 100 years later during Karsus's Folly , while at the same time the sun was blocked by an eclipse, the sky filled with storms, and darkness fell upon the land. Within the next few hours the temple and Trinity had been abandoned as the population sought shelter to the south.</p>
