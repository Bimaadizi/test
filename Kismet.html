<p>Kismet was an Angardt city in ancient Netheril .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The city was located within the Flats in the distant southwest of Netheril, and was the only permanent settlement there.</p>
<h2>Religion</h2>
<p>Kismet was a holy site for the Angardt, where important ceremonies of the tribes were conducted, such as marriages, newborn babies were blessed, and tribal leaders were established. In the days around Midsummer , almost all the Angardt of the Flats moved to the city temporarily.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Kismet became a center of horse -raising and training, with the beasts sold onward to the warriors, explorers, and adventurers of Netheril. The horse-trading of Kismet was so important that even the haughty arcanists of Netheril gave them a measure of respect.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The city came to be when the Angardt people separated from the Rengarth and had to make the Flats their new home in 2612 NY (−1247 DR) . The barbarians immediately came into conflict with the thieves of Thiefsward , finding them despicably cowardly, and after a brief war they entered a period of peace with only a few skirmishes between them.</p>
<p>The city lasted as an Angardt stronghold until well after Karsus's Folly , when the Anauroch 's advance caused it to be abandoned by 3650 NY (−209 DR) .</p>
