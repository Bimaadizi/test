<p>Lady Joelle Emmeline , also known as the Thief of Hearts , was a jewel thief from Berdusk who became a heartwarder of Sune , and later her chosen , during the Second Sundering in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Joelle was very free spirited, believing that men and women should not exert control over one in another in their relationships - a belief that stood in contrast to her unique powers. She believed that the gods acted in very much the same way as mortals, directing their followers into the lives of one another to accomplish their own ends.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As the chosen of Sune, Joelle possessed great command over charm magic. She could readily garner the support of another person with a mere smile, and could outright control them with her touch.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>While Joelle shared a divine mission with her fellow chosen Malik el Sami , believed to be a servant of Myrkul , the two had opposing world perspectives. Malik was petty and viewed his relationships as transactional, whereas Joelle put her value in the freedom to share joy and pleasure with others who were open to the experience.</p>
<p>She formed close relationships with the two other chosen who accompanied the pair on their quest, Kleef Kenric and Arietta Seasilver . Joelle sought to share her love with Kleef, then later Arietta, as Joelle knew that in order to fulfill the last ritual, someone who was completely in love with another person would have to willingly sacrifice themself. Joelle and Arietta became lovers and grew quite fond of one another during their days traveling across Faerûn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Joelle was born an illegitimate daughter of an unnamed lord of Berdusk. She spent much of her life as a thief, specializing in the procurement of valuable jewels , until she joined the church of Sune in the Year of the Iron Dwarf's Vengeance, 1485 DR . One day in the service of Lady Firehair, Joelle awoke to find she had vibrant red hair and was granted the ability to both charm and heal others as she wished. She also began receiving visions, specifically of a crudely-shaped orb of quartz .</p>
<p>The following year , Joelle was tasked by Sune with the mission of stealing the orb, called the Eye of Gruumsh , from the Hidden Temple of Nishrek in the orc stronghold of Big Bone Deep in the Stonelands of Cormyr . Paired with the unlikely companion of Malik el Sami, who was uniquely charged as the bearer of the Eye , Joelle would take the relic to the temple of the earth primordial Grumbar at Sadrach's Spire in the Underchasm .</p>
<p>Pursued by both vengeful orcs, and Shadovar agents led by Prince Yder Tanthul , Joelle and Malik sought refuge in Marsember . There they met the young noblewoman Arietta Seasilver, and the Helmite guardsman Kleef Kenric, who joined them on their quest. With their new companions, Joelle and Malik managed to escape their pursuers and continue their mission at sea.</p>
<p>The group sailed south across the Sea of Fallen Stars , taking the Eye to the lands of the Vilhon Reach , and beyond into the wild forest known as the Chondalwood . After fighting off more orc raiders and shades , the group arrived at the Underchasm and made their way to Sadrach's Spire. With the aid of Sadrach 's granddaughter Gingrid , they made their way past the keep's undead denizens and into the catacombs within.</p>
<p>Once Joelle and her companions were in Grumbar's temple, Arietta accepted her role as sacrifice and Joelle realized her feelings for the young noblewoman. When Malik turned on the group and tried to kill Arietta in the name of Cryic, Joelle intercepted the fatal blow and accepted her role as the necessary sacrifice.</p>
