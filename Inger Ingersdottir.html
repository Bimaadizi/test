<p>Inger Ingersdottir was a dwarf who served as the personal assistant of Hal Stoutheart during his Tethyamar expedition in the 1480s DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Inger had light skin and long flowing brown hair. She wore a very fine outfit (setting her apart from the miners and guards of the expedition) and several pieces of jewelry .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Inger was a very capable woman, but was utterly dazzled by Hal's (or rather, Graz'zt's) personality and joined the general mania around the jewels of ardor . She became somewhat obsessed with his greatness, and this led her to overlook the inconsistencies in his story and the strange events around the expedition.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Inger practically ran the Tethyamar mining outpost for Hal, handling the recruitment, logistics, and excavations.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Inger managed Hal's affairs as the expedition set up in the Tethyamar mining outpost and began mining the jewels of ardor . She was kept extremely busy throughout this, as the dwarves fell prey to natural hazards and monsters, the undead , the House Argith drow , and their own creeping madness. This came to a head when her master suddenly vanished into the Eastern Reaches and did not return. She sent some useful hirelings to find Hal, and after some confusing and horrifying trials (including the village of Faraway ) they discovered that Hal had died in Blue Stone Cavern years ago, and the leader of the expedition was in fact the demon lord Graz'zt .</p>
<p>Inger was quite rocked to learn that she had been the personal assistant of Graz'zt, and questioned everything she had believed in life. Despite this, she kept positive attitude and looked forward to fixing things.</p>
