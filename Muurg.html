<p>Muurg was a kobold hero of some renown whose short life and career ended sometime before 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Muurg's heroic career remained largely unrecorded. He was known for briefly possessing the unique set of enchanted chainmail , the Zeal's Walk . The armor was created by a witch coven, the Newt's Brood for their lover, who tossed the item when he married an elven lass. Muurg briefly owned the Zeal's Walk but lost it in death, possibly somewhere in the Lonely Barrens , where the armor was hidden under a rock in 1372 DR.</p>
