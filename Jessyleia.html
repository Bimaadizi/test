<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to her venture into business ownership and relocation to Mosstone in the Greenshores of Tethyr, Jessyleia has a successful career in Calimshan. She made a living as a talented silks-dancer and later took her savings to a city on the Trade Way where she opened Jessyleia's Drinking Jack. Her tavern was a lot and popular establishment, loud with bellow drums and blast- horns music. She kept her place pristinely clean and lusciously decorated in rich, bright colors. Jessyleia employed skillful dancers. However, when the mood stroked her, she took to the stage performing an impromptu dance for her dear customers.</p>
