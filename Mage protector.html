<p>Mage Protectors were tower shields with enchantments of the highest order. They were created by the Imaskari for their elite warriors to better protect their assigned artificers and magewrights.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Mage Protectors carried a protective enchantment of the highest grade, and granted awesome resistance against magic that affected the mind. They also boosted the wielder's strength, nearly doubling it; unfortunately, this came with a great loss of intelligence.</p>
