<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early Life</h3>
<p>A member of the noble family of Cassalanter , one of the richest families in Waterdeep, Caladorn ceased using his family's name until he had done "something worthy of it." His father, Lord Ohrl Cassalanter , believed that Caladorn would never deem himself worthy, and so he was left with the benefits of his birthright but none of the responsibilities.</p>
<h3>Adventuring Years</h3>
<p>In the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR , Caladorn was traveling on the ship Cutter , a seal -hunting ship captained by Farlow in the Sea of Moving Ice . While he was on the ship, the crew discovered an abandoned ship full of pickled sea elves packed in barrels bearing the mark of Ruathym . It was later discovered to be part of a plot to provoke the Lords' Alliance into war on Ruathym.</p>
<p>Caladorn intended to bring the barrels back to Waterdeep to begin an investigation, but his ship was intercepted by the Elfmaid , which scuttled their ship and marooned the crew. With the help of Xzorsh , Caladorn was eventually able to make it to safety on Ruathym and explain his story.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, Caladorn traveled back to Waterdeep with Liriel Baenre and Fyodor , helping them to contact Danilo Thann in order to secure safe passage to the Promenade of the Dark Maiden near Skullport .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR , Caladorn was courting Lucia Thione and planning to marry her. However, Lucia, a high-ranking member of the Knights of the Shield , discovered that he was a Lord of Waterdeep and attempted to poison him in order to keep her true allegiances secret. Heartbroken, Caladorn quit the Lords and his city for two years, traveling the Sword Coast . After returning to Waterdeep, Caladorn involved himself with the Waterdhavian navy.</p>
<h3>Later Years and Death</h3>
<p>By the Year of the Fallen Friends, 1399 DR , Caladorn had been named Open Lord of Waterdeep.</p>
<p>After his death, Caladorn's body was interned in the family crypt under Cassalanter Villa in Waterdeep with his plate armor and Mace of disruption . His ghost continued to dwell within the crypt, sympathetic to those bore the holy symbol of Siamorphe .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
