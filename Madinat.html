<p>Madinat , or the Round City , was the name of the main sector of the city of Dhaztanar in Semphar .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Madinat sat next to the harbor of Furdah Rustauk . It was considered to be the heart of Dhaztanar. As the nickname of the Round City implied, Madinat formed a perfect circle.</p>
<p>Surrounded by a moat and a strong outer and inner wall, Madinat was the most fortified section of the city. An open courtyard stretched behind the outer walls until it reached a third inner wall. This wall protected the houses of notable citizens, gardens, temples, and the palace of the caliph.</p>
<p>Four gates in the walls, known as the Grand Bab , led to the Caliph's palace, the Dar al-Kalif .</p>
