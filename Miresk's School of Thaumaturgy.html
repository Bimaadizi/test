<p>Miresk's School of Thaumaturgy was a school of magic in Silverymoon . It was a founding member institution of the Conclave of Silverymoon .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The school was located in the Southbank of Silverymoon, the newer section of the city.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The building was constructed of dark, bristling stone and was very castle-like, with side-turrets, flying buttresses, and balconies.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The school was the private home of its headmaster, Eltro Miresk . Those who studied here were also made to wear uniforms, later becoming iconic of the school with their red robes . At the waist, students further wore a long sash . This served to tell each individual's rank, and could be of either black, grey, or white coloration. They also carried with them their birch staves , which were tall and whose tops were ornamented by raven feathers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR , Miresk agreed to merge his school into the Conclave of Silverymoon and was appointed the first Magus Senior of that university. The school was still in existence as late as 1479 DR .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>As a college within the Conclave, the School of Thaumaturgy was where both wizards and sorcerers applying to programs at the Lady's College or elsewhere in the university were first evaluated for placement. They could be either accepted into the program or placed on a waiting list.</p>
