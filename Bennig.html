<p>Bennig was one of the Blades of the Old Man as of 1374Â DR . On the night of Tarsakh 25 , he was on guard duty at the Fortress of the Old Man together with Galban , though Bennig himself tried to sleep through the watch. After Galban warned him about a light he'd seen, the two met up with Jerumillis . They pursued the light into the Gallery of Stone Faces , where Jerumilis was attacked, and then they found Lurom 's body.</p>
