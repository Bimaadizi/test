<p>Phathroi was a dutiful baelnorn (or guardnorn) in the ruins of Myth Drannor up to the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Phathroi defended Myth Drannor's ruins for centuries until the Elven Crusade arrived to restore the city. Unfortunately, the Red Wizards of Thay also arrived to raid and rob, even finding an old Cult of the Dragon base hidden in the ruins where the Cult had once attempted a dracolich ritual. The dracolich Karliath had been left trapped and incomplete there only to be found by the unworshipful Red Wizards, who saw this as an opportunity to enslave a powerful undead minion. Realizing this was beyond even her abilities, Phathroi called on the Elves of Cormanthor at their nearby camp and directed them to strike at the Red Wizards before they could escape with Karliath in tow.</p>
<p>While Phathroi used her magic to seal the area and prevent their escape, the Elves and their allies broke into the horror-filled lair to finish the job. They fought their way through the remnants of the Eternal Brigade , the marilith Ophael , Grand Ritualist Kathul Sep , and finally met and destroyed Karliath himself, saving the world from the menace of yet another dracolich.</p>
