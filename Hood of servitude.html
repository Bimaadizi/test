<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This item looked like a regular falcon hood.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When placed upon the head of any flying creature, the hood of servitude charmed the creature so that it would loyally serve the owner of the hood. The hood would instantly grow or shrink to fit the head of the creature. This hood's magic worked on avians as well as other flying creatures such as dragons and even the mighty Zakharan rocs . The hood never failed to charm when used against natural animals, but intelligent creatures did have a chance to resist the hood's magic.</p>
