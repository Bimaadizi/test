<p>The White Sails company was the preeminent supplier of mercenaries—both soldiers and ships —operating out of Mintarn in the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>White Sails ships traveled all across the Sea of Swords and along the Sword Coast for work, taking jobs from Neverwinter to Elturel and sometimes working for other mercenary groups like the Flaming Fist of Baldur's Gate .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Dagult Neverember invested heavily in the White Sails company as part of his broader efforts to invest in Mintarn, which included creating a ship-building company and combat training facilities on the island.</p>
<p>The company was on good terms with Janolus Fuscus , a goblin captain of a submersible called the Nudibranch , who trawled the waters between the Moonshae Isles and Mintarn.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dagult Neverember's investment in the White Sails company began prior to his ascension to Open Lord of Waterdeep , and with his backing, it grew to become the premier exporter of Mintarn muscle to the Sword Coast. After he became Open Lord circa 1468 DR , his efforts to eliminate piracy led to the destruction of Waterdeep's City Navy , and to replace it, he used Waterdhavian funds to hire Mintarn mercenary companies in which he had financial interests (like White Sails). He did something similar when he subsequently hired Mintarn mercenaries to help him secure Neverwinter following the eruption of Mount Hotenow . As part of his " New Neverwinter " movement, he used such mercenaries to patrol the streets, defend his interests, and enforce militaristic order within the city.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, White Sails was famous enough that young adventurers from as far afield as Norland in the Moonshae Isles sought to join. The company was so popular that slavers learned to target aspiring new recruits from outside Mintarn by promising to induct them into the company.</p>
<p>The company retained its reputation through the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , even after Dagult Neverember had been ousted from his position in Waterdeep and the demand for Mintarn mercenaries dried up in both Waterdeep and Neverwinter. At least some members of the White Sails were present for a hopeless battle to defend Mintarn from the red dragon Hoondarrh when he attacked the island sometime before 1492 DR , and they subsequently helped to treat the wounded and evacuate the survivors before leaving to pursue their own goals.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>Members were sailors who were grouped by the ship on which they were assigned to serve. Membership was diverse, including not only humans from Mintarn and beyond but also elves , dragonborn , kenku , and more. It attracted all manner of adventurers seeking to travel the world, ranging from rogues and fighters to warlocks and wizards .</p>
