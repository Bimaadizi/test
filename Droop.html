<p>Droop was a goblin and slave to the Redbrand bugbears who dwelt in Tresendar Manor circa 1491 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Droop was very cowardly, and often got picked on by stronger goblinoids. He would humiliate himself for the enjoyment of them, and was liable to faint. He would also hide from fights, and cower, and if he was forced to fight, would do so terribly. However, Droop was knowledgeable about the layout of the manor, even secret doors and hidden areas, as well as the general direction of Cragmaw Castle .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1491 DR, Iarno Albrek and his bandits known as the Redbrands took the ruins of Tresendar Manor as their base. Nezznar , the Black Spider, sent three bugbears to enforce the manor, and they began to pick on the little goblin. Droop followed their orders, however demeaning they were. He hoped he would be rescued, and if so, would try to ingratiate himself with his saviors.</p>
