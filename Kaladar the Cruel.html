<p>Kaladar the Cruel was a member of the Arcane Brotherhood of Luskan and the bitter rival of Celerum the Black in the midâ€“14 th century DR.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1334 DR , Kaladar was trying to find out what Celerum the Black's goal was. He was able to determine that Celerum sought Damien Morienus ' Accursed Tower and that he'd hired adventurers to discover its secrets for him. Kaladar knew that Celerum was impersonating someone but had no idea who.</p>
<p>Kaladar the Cruel arrived at the Ten Towns following his rival, shortly after the adventurers discovered the tower and the diary hidden inside. The spies Kaladar employed kept a close eye on the adventurers. Kaladar used an alter self spell to impersonate a human advance agent for a traveling group of entertainers. In reality, the "entertainers" were Kaladar's hired thugs and assassins.</p>
<p>He used all available methods to achieve his goals, even luring one of the adventures away from the group under pretense, and using charm person on them.</p>
