<p>A wand of paralyzation , also known as a wand of paralysis , was a magical wand capable of paralyzing opponents.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When activated, a wand of paralyzation shot a beam of blue light at its target.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The user could expend a charge of the wand to paralyze opponents, before potentially crumbling to ash. The wand itself had seven charges, and when used, it would emit a blue ray out of its tip, towards a creature within 60 feet (18 meters). The creature that was struck would be paralyzed for a minute.</p>
<p>At dawn, two to seven charges (the maximum amount) would be replenished. Alternatively, one could cast hold monster on a wand to recharge it.</p>

<p>Not many names of wizards who created these wands were widely known due to the stigma that wands of paralyzation carried—many associated these wands with cruelty and treacherousness. Even though wands of paralyzation were often used by brave adventurers, the tavern tales about heroic warriors being captured and tortured with these wands were simply more popular.</p>
