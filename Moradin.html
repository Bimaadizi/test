<p>Moradin ( pronounced : /ˈ m ɔːr ɑː d ɪ n / MOR-a-din or : /ˈ m ɔːr ə d ɪ n / MOR-uh-din ) was the lawful good god of the dwarves and the chief deity in their pantheon . The Soul Forger was strength incarnate and force of will embodied, a harsh but fair judge who evaluated his creations by the goodness of their works first and intentions second. The Dwarffather inspired dwarven inventions and constantly sought to improve their race, encouraging a good-natured, intelligent, and harmonious existence with other good races while battling their pride and isolationist tendencies.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Moradin appeared as a 20 feet (6.1 meters) tall dwarf with a powerful build, particularly in the upper body. He was a stern-faced figure with flowing hair, his mane and beard both reaching his knees (and alternatively described as black or white). He dressed plainly, wearing a smith's leather leggings and aprons in addition to furs and bracers of pure gold on his forearms, his garments transforming into dwarven plate mail and a large shield when needed. Moradin also exuded a faintly visible white radiance, an aura of power he could cloak as he wished.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Moradin expected his children to aspire to his utmost levels of expertise, to study his techniques so they might follow in his footsteps. He was gruff, stern and virtually incapable of compromise, tirelessly and unflinchingly defending his people, their values, and his principles of good and law . While a good heart was necessary for his acceptance, only quality results earned his approval.</p>
<p>Contrary to some rumors Moradin was incredibly crafty, but kept that side of himself out of public view. He allowed others to believe he was mentally lacking so that they would drop their guard, granting him the advantage.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Moradin preferred to work through manifestations rather than avatars, believing that dwarves had to work for their own place and salvation in the world, and so he seldom appeared in the Realms. When he did, it was only to help dwarves against a numerically overpowering force, and he might bestow blessings to favored warriors prior to the battle such as strength spells.</p>
<p>Usually any intervention from Moradin served the purpose of guiding his people to the best decisions in times of crisis, but he also did so to aid those that might be of help to the dwarves as a whole. This took the form of either inspiring dwarves who would serve their kin in the future or encouraging non-dwarves to provide assistance to his people.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Moradin had a strategic but friendly alliance with Gond , Kossuth , Helm , Torm , Tyr , and the heads of the elven , gnome , and halfling pantheons . He opposed the gods of the goblinoids , orcs , evil giants , and banished dwarves.</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Moradin's clerics , known as Sonnlinor , were usually drawn from family lines, like most dwarven occupations; they wore earthy colors, with chain mail and silvered helms . Moradin charged his followers with the task of wiping out the kingdoms of orcs and wiping out the followers of Gruumsh . The church of Moradin had an active role in guiding the morals of dwarven communities; they emphasized his hand in everyday dwarven activities such as mining, smithing, and engineering, and invoked his blessing when these tasks began. They led the push to found new dwarven kingdoms and increase their status among surface communities. Many of these communities celebrated Hammer 1st, believing that day in 1306 DR to be a blessing by the Dwarffather.</p>
<h3>Orders</h3>
<h2>Rituals</h2>
<p>Moradin's holy day was on the crescent moon and he was worshiped at forges and hearths.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Moradin was held in dwarven myths to have been incarnated from rock, stone, and metal, and that his soul an ember of fire. It was said he forged the first dwarves from metals and gems and breathed souls into them when he blew on his creations to cool them. Moradin was responsible for banishing the evil gods of the derro and duergar from the surface.</p>
<p>Moradin's avatar appeared while the Ironstar dwarf clan was fleeing from orcs at the Stone Bridge , after a desperate appeal by Daurvos Frostbeard (which was his final act), and helped them defeat the orcs and gain safe passage to Ironford , thereby forming the Fallen Kingdom .</p>
