<p>Zerths were especially adept githzerai monks who best followed the teachings of Zerthimon . Through rigid discipline and training, they were capable of remarkable psionic feats.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Highly skilled in martial and psionic arts, zerths were capable of transporting between planes only using their minds. They were capable of innately casting plane shift once per day. In combat, they could also use their minds to inflict damage upon their opponents, through innately casting phantasmal killer .</p>
<p>Especially gifted zerths, known as "enlightened", were capable of even more extraordinary psionic feats, such as innately casting haste and teleport and enhancing their own defenses through psionic power.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Zerths filled the equivalent role of priests in the non-religious githzerai society. They were considered the inheritors of Zerthimon's philosophies, as well as his first choice to assist him directly upon his prophesied return. Following the githzerai custom of paying respects to their departed ancestors, it was common for zerths to honor Zerthimon in the same way.</p>
<p>The honorific title of zerth could also be granted to githzerai who pursued diverse disciplines, in particular mixing martial and psionic training with arcane studies. It was usually bestowed upon students who had proven their skills during challenging missions.</p>
