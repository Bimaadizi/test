<p>Safiya was a Red Wizard of Thay in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR and one of the companions of the Kalach-Cha .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Unlike many Red Wizards, Safiya was uninterested in struggling for power, and preferred scholarly research and practice of arcane magic . Safiya was interested in magic that transformed and creating constructs . She worked as an instructor at the Academy of Shapers and Binders , of which her mother Nefris was the headmistress.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She appeared shy on the rare occasions when she smiled, apparently for lack of practice. Yet she had mental resilience from her upbringing in Thay. The Kalach-Cha inferred that her somewhat sheltered upbringing as the headmistress's daughter might have had something to do with her being "less ruthless" than other Red Wizards.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Safiya had golden-hued skin, delicate features, and almond-shaped dark eyes, and appeared beautiful to most eyes. She shaved her head bald, for it was adorned with the fine tattoos of a Red Wizard.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>Safiya had a homunculus familiar named Kaji . It was one of her first creations and she was quite fond of it.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As a wizard , Safiya was specialized in the school of transmutation (and restricted from both conjuration and illusion ). As a transmuter , she was dedicated to building and shaping objects, and was skilled at crafting enchanted weaponry and armaments.</p>
