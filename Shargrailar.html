<p>Shargrailar was a great wyrm red dragon whose lair was in the mountains near the headwaters of the Immerflow in the Thunder Peaks .</p>
<p>He was the first successful dracolich created by Sammaster in the Year of the Queen's Tears, 902 DR . Shargrailar went on to become the most powerful dracolich in the Cult of the Dragon and a loyal ally of Sammaster.</p>
<p>Shargrailar's demise occurred during the hunt for Shandril Shessair . After Shandril destroyed two dracoliches and an archmage of the Cult, Shargrailar decided to resolve the matter himself and ambushed the girl and her friends. However, her spellfire proved too powerful even for Shargrailar and the dracolich was destroyed for good.</p>
