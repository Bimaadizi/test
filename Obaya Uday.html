<p>Obaya Uday ( pronounced : / oʊ ˈ b aɪ j ɑː uː ˈ d eɪ / oh-BY-yah oo-DAY ) was a Chultan priest of Waukeen from Port Nyanzaru who traveled to Waterdeep in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>She spent her time at the Yawning Portal , offering to pay premium (and nonnegotiable) prices for magic items and spellbooks recovered from the treacherous dungeon of Undermountain .</p>
<p>She discouraged inexperienced adventurers from delving into Undermountain, but was happy to help them gain the skills they needed to do so.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Obaya's venture to collect magic items was on behalf of her employer, Wakanga O'tamu , a wizard and merchant prince of Port Nyanzaru who controlled all trade in magic and lore within that city.</p>
<p>She hired a surveyor named Azuli Tefnek to map the routes into the deeper levels of Undermountain and to retrieve magical relics from within.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Obaya travelled from her native Chult to Waterdeep around 1492 DR with the objective of acquiring magical treasures for her master, Wakanga O'tamu. To that end, she placed a large amount of platinum pieces in local banks and found her way to the Yawning Portal, where she booked a room and began to sponsor expeditions into Undermountain. It was her intention to hire bodyguards to protect herself and her acquisitions once she was ready to return to Chult.</p>
