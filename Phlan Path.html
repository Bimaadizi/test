<p>The Phlan Path was the road along the northern coast of the Moonsea lake that connected the cities of Phlan and Melvaunt .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>While it was one of the most well-developed roads along the northern coast of the sea, for some stretches it was merely a well-trodden dirt path.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Phlan path intersected with the Iron Route at the bank of the Stojanow River near Phlan.</p>
<p>Traveling east from Phlan, the path intercepted the termination of Toranth's March , the southbound trail from Castle Vathar , before intersecting the Trank River at a lone bridge crossing. It wound through the Moonwatch Hills before finally reaching Melvaunt.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , group of bandits operating along the Phlan Path slew a lone ogre ravager traveling down from Thar . The ogre carried a unique obelisk made of jade , that was in fact the key that could open up the Tomb of Vorbyx .</p>
<p>Highwaymen continued to plague the road even a century later, as the Merchant's Guild of Phlan suffered a number of robberies along that stretch of the Moonsea North .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Around that same time rumors circulated that orcs were assaulting people that traveled along the Phlan Path.</p>
