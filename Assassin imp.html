<p>Assassin imps were a specialized variety of imp from the Nine Hells . As per the name, they were among the deadliest of the imp varieties, being specially practiced in the murder of the helpless.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Assassin imps resembled their common kin, ranging from 1​ to ​2 feet (0.3​ to ​0.61 meters) tall, but had scales ranging in hue from slate gray to jet-black as opposed to the standard red. They had a pair of bat -like wings and long, slender scorpion -like tails that dangled behind them in constant motion. Their mouths were filled with wickedly sharp, ivory -white teeth and a long, raspy tongue.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Clever, deceptive and murderous, assassin imps delighted in slaughtering defenseless innocents even moreso than most imps. Such was their wicked glee in spilling blood that they happily pursued any target they were given, but they particularly enjoyed killing those already pledged to their infernal master. They enjoyed painfully and bloodily awakening victims, only to render them unconscious a moment later.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Assassin imps were fast flyers, resistant to fire, and had numerous spell-like abilities. These included powers such as invisibility , detect magic , and find traps at will, knock or cause light wounds thrice per day, and command once per day.</p>
<p>Ironically, the tail poison of assassin imps was not nearly as dangerous as that of their normal counterparts. Though harmful, the virulent venom was not especially lethal. Targets were at the very least slowed and perhaps drowsy, or they were were likely to be immobilized or could fall asleep with a sustained sting. At its most potent, they might fall into a deep, days-long state of hibernation, like that caused by the feign death spell.</p>
<p>There was a contrast to be drawn between the regular assassin imps and those known as "murder lords", whose powers differed from their lessers in their capacity for subterfuge. Firstly, rather than just turning invisible, they also became insubstantial and phased through objects, and after striking from invisibility they could teleport a short distance away.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Aided by their spell-like abilities like invisibility , assassin imps often struck without warning, avoiding detection until their victim drew near and diving at them. Foes caught unaware generally received longer injections of venom, while waking targets they attempted to put to sleep. Only when targets proved resistant to their poison did they fight properly, with a combination of tail stings and sharp blades. Some carried tiny daggers or jagged bits of scrap metal, most used straight razors, but all were adept at bleeding out the helpless.</p>
<p>Assassin imps often worked in teams, or as the vanguard of a proper assault. Generally they tried to kill their victims in some way linked to their professions, such as with objects related to their work. Otherwise, when they placed them in comas, they often lingered nearby in hopes of seeing their mistaken companions bury them alive, arranging for the truth to be revealed only after it was too late.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Assassin imps were notably dedicated creatures, even to mortal masters. However, they would ruthlessly kill any being they deemed a threat to their master, even regardless of the master's own desire, often acting on their own to "defend" their lord. This could drive an assassin imp to attempt to murder anyone their master knew, loved ones included, if they believed the subject knew too much, and could ultimately draw unwanted attention.</p>
<p>Assassin imps were often sent to eliminate enemies of diabolists and devil cults.</p>
<p>Assassin imps spoke Common and Supernal , but could also communicate with others of their kind using a language some described as "purely evil in sound and expression".</p>
<p>In Ravenloft , assassin imps were the tools of the Dark Powers , and acted to drive the already evil into actions that would trap them in the Domains of Dread forever.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Assassin imps had keen eyesight, augmented with 60 feet (18 meters) infravision . They were carnivorous creatures that operated at night.</p>
