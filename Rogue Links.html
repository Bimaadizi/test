<p>Rogue Links were light chain shirts , black in cover, and usable by rogues only. Only a handful of these sets of enchanted armor existed circa late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Rogue Links appeared to be blackened and charred with soot.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Rogue Links possessed the +3 enchantment, and due to the thick magical and seemingly un-removable soot, Rogue Links muffled the wearer's movement significantly increasing their ability to move in silence and the soot's black color improved the ability to hide.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These sets of odd enchanted chainmail first appeared in Thay and areas surrounding it in 1020 DR . Sages and lore masters determined that the magical charring was not originated from the outside of the armor but from the inside, making them believe that Rogue Links' were created in some horrific Thayan magical attack or a curse placed on the original users.</p>
<p>In 1372 DR , one set of these morbid chain armors was in possession of Ophala Cheldarstorn in Neverwinter , and another one was sold by a black market merchant Stran in Daggerford .</p>
<p>In 1374 DR another set ended up in possession of Limm , a Shadow Thieves member operating in the Blacklake District of Neverwinter.</p>
