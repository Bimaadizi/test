<p>Galast was a Malarite druid active in the High Forest during the middle of the 14 th century DR . He was usually followed by the wolf Fang, his animal companion.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Galast was born from a couple of outlaws living in the High Forest. Raised in the faith of Malar , he became a tracker and a scout, hunting to survive and hiding to escape from the bounty hunters tracking his parents.</p>
<p>After witnessing an elder druid known as " Wolf Dragon " single-handedly destroy an elven warband, Galast became his apprentice and learnt druidcraft. Thrice did his new mentor try to give him the gift of lycanthropy , thrice did he fail: Galast displayed some changes, but never fully succumbed to the curse. Disgusted, Wolf Dragon sent his pupil away to wander the forest on his own.</p>
<p>While roaming the forest, Galast found a lost spellbook in a bear cave. Unaware that the " Earthmother's Weapons " was a Chauntean holy book, Galast deciphered its content and learned the spells it contained. Despite being spells from his sworn enemies, Malar deemed them useful in the hands of his worshiper, and granted their power to the druid. By the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Galast was still the owner of this sacred tome.</p>
