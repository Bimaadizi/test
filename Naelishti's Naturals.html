<p>Naelishti's Naturals , also called House Naelishti , was an Amnian trading company that operated in Amn's colony at Port Nyanzaru in Chult during the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As an Amnian trading company in Port Nyanzaru, Naelishti's wielded a great deal of influence in the city and was in constant political and financial competition with the other trade companies. Affiliation with the company granted the right to reside within the safety of Port Nyanzaru's wall.</p>
<p>Naelishti's specialized in the export of rare Chultan plants that could be processed into dyes , medicines , perfumes , and poisons in Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Agents of Naelishti's had access to a special salve that soothed the venomous bites of insects , the sting of poisonous plants, or the effects of jungle diseases . The formula for this salve was known only to the company.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Naelishti's participated in sponsoring a great hunt that served as a competition between Port Nyanzaru's dozens of trading companies. They vied against the other companies—notably Charisk Expeditionary Outfitters , House Selemchant , the Order of Belox , and Zazefay Logging and Mining —to recruit the most capable hunters. The company's special salve gave their competitors an edge in the jungle environment.</p>
<p>Amnian companies like Naelishti's were subsequently expelled from Port Nyanzaru by the Ytepka Society and a local merchant consortium in the late 15 th century DR, and were replaced by seven merchant princes as the city's mercantile and political leaders. Naelishti's trade in rare plants was taken over by the prince Jessamine .</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, may of the company's emplyees were Chultan locals with distinctively snake -like features, owing to at least some yuan-ti heritage. It was unclear whether this was because the company had been infiltrated by these people or if the company was instead taking advantage of them.</p>
<p>The company's liaison to hired adventurers was a beautiful and graceful female shifter with dusky skin.</p>
