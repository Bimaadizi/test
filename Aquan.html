<p>Aquan was the language of the Elemental Plane of Water .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Aquan was a flowing language full of subtleties of meaning. Aquatic elves , hadozee , merfolk , tritons , water genasi , tortles and locathah all spoke Aquan.</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, it was considered a dialect of Primordial , so that creatures who spoke one of the other elemental dialects such as Auran , Ignan or Terran could understand Aquan and vice-versa.</p>
