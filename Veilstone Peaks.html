<p>The Veilstone Peaks was a mountainous region in the Sunset Mountains .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Veilstone Peaks were located to the northwest of Cormyr , approximately 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of the Farsea Marshes . It was a desolate region populated by a handful of impoverished villages.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The majority of the region comprised flat and uninhabited terrain, interspersed with isolated hillocks and areas of scant pastureland. The mountains within the Veilstone Peaks ascended 1,000​ to ​2,000 feet (300​ to ​610 meters) above sea level. These peaks were composed entirely of solid rock, featuring smooth and sheer faces.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>The region features small woodlands comprised of oak and birch trees. The rocky soil in the area was inhospitable to plant life.</p>
<h3>Climate</h3>
<p>The Veilstone Peaks region was characterized by its cool and dry atmosphere. Daytime temperatures ranged from the high 60s (about 15–20°C) to the mid-40s Fahrenheit (about 4–9 °C), while nighttime temperatures often fell to the high 30s Fahrenheit (about 3–4°C).</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The villages situated within the Veilstone Peaks were among the poorest in the region, primarily due to their scarce natural resources and their remote location, far from principal trade arteries. Connectivity was primarily through trails, and the villages generally remained insular, with minimal interaction between themselves or with the external world.</p>
<p>A standard village in this area was essentially a cluster of rudimentary homes, constructed from wood and stone, and containing a single room. Additionally, there were a few unassuming shops and storage facilities. Despite their lack of sophistication, the villagers were known for their honesty, amiability, and industrious nature, endeavoring to eke out a living from their diminutive farms.</p>
<p>The population of these villages was entirely human . With the notable exception of Garnerr , governance in each village was provided by a constable or sheriff. These officials were elected by the villagers and possessed qualities that distinguished them from their fellow villagers, reflecting their exceptional status.</p>
