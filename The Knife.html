<p>The Knife was a pinnacle of stone rising between eighty and ninety feet (twenty-four to twenty-seven meters) above the ground near the Trader's Way about four days wagon ride north of Delzimmer in southeast Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This rock formation was like a rapier , slim and sharply pointed at the sky. Nearby, just to the east, was a deep well that contained tainted water that made most consumers very sick. The Trader's Way bent in an easterly direction here, bypassing some cliffs to the north of the Knife that marked the boundary of the eastern Shaar . Rising up about thirty feet (nine meters), the cliffs provided a break from the wind and weather, but travelers and caravans had to keep a wary eye for attacks from above.</p>
<p>The Knife could be reached in four days by wagon from Delzimmer, or three days at a traveling pace for mounted riders. If mounts were not spared, an urgent rider could reach the Knife by the middle of the second night out of Delzimmer.</p>
