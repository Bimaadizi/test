<p>Essam was an elf from Al Qahera in Raurin as of 1374Â DR . When Kiril Duskmourn sought to take refuge from a dust storm of the Raurin in Al Qahara, it was Essam that was at the door and let her in; at the moment, he was wearing a white gown, and a larger, rune-covered cloth over it. Though his features were elven, he was sun-weathered.</p>
<p>He became interested in Kiril's tale as soon as she mentioned that she sought a source of evil north of their settlement, and told her of their own experiences with the Storm Spike, as they'd dubbed the Palace of the Purple Emperor . When Kiril was about to leave, he bequeathed Sandrul unto her, hoping she could avenge Feraih with it.</p>
