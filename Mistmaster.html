<p>The Mistmaster was a very powerful illusionist and cleric of Leira living in the Citadel of the Mists in the High Forest and a senior member of the Moonstars in 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Almost nothing was known about the Mistmaster and his dealings with Khelben Arunsun ; some speculated that it was under Khelben's orders that the Mistmaster destroyed Hellgate Keep with the Gatekeeper's Crystal . What was sure was that the Mistmaster oversaw the treant Turlang and reported to Khelben all news about activities in the High Forest and its surroundings.</p>
<p>In 1374 DR , he was among the many powerful mages whom Arunsun brought together in order to cleanse part of the High Moor and restore Faer'tel'miir , a lost city of Miyeritar .</p>
