<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Elminster Aumar was attacked by bandits while riding across the Skuldaskar during the first frosts of the Year of the Chosen, 240 DR , going from Elturel to Berdusk . He found many of the bandits' weapons to have an emblem of a serpent ready to strike. As the bandits struck his horse down, he walked the rest of the way, stopping at the Herald's Horn .</p>
<p>By 1372Â DR , the Skuldaskar along both sides of Skuldask Road had been cut down extensively, with some light woods in swamps and heights, all else being tilled farms. The road remained, however.</p>
