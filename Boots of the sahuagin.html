<p>Boots of the sahuagin were enchanted boots worn by sailors and pirates of the Nelanther Isles and the Sea of Swords .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Despite their name, boots of the sahuagin were not crafted by sahuagin and were very obviously manmade. These boots were well-made and sewn out of water-resisting material that made them quite popular among fishers and sailors. The minor enchantment that was placed on these boots increased the wearer's fortitude.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These sailors' boots were in common use in the late-14 th century DR . Notably, Captain Allendry of the Midnight Rose outfitted his crew and offered the boots for sale.</p>
