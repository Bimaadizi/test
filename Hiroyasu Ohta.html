<p>Hiroyasu Ohta was a master swordsmith of Jasuga in Wa in the 1700s on the Wa Calendar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Wa Year 1773 (1355 DR) , Hiroyasu was widely rumored to be making a masterpiece katana that would be the pinnacle of his craft. But thieves invaded his workshop and slew him, apparently seeking to steal the sword. It was not recovered, and afterwards legends grew about the so-called Lost Sword .</p>
<p>In fact, Hiroyasu's spirit had risen again as a kuei , driven by a powerful unfulfilled purpose to finish his sword, which still had no hilt. Lacking a physical form, each night he tried to possess the current owner of the sword-blade to work on it, granting them his skills but leaving no memories, and not thinking to explain. However, he had little success in this, and the thieves and subsequent owners believed it haunted and always quickly sold The Lost Sword on, sending Hiroyasu after it.</p>
<p>Two years and two dozen changes of hands later, in Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR) , both The Lost Sword and Hiroyasu were in Aru, in possession of a weaselly hawker who would try to sell it to passing adventurers.</p>
<p>If finally successful, Hiroyasu would complete the The Lost Sword , be satisfied, and disappear forever.</p>
