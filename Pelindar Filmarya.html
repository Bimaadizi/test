<p>Lord Pelindar Filmarya was a paladin of Tyr and the ruler of Leilon following the Time of Troubles . Of mixed Waterdhavian and Tethyrian noble blood, his father's side of the family was once renowned in Tethyr for the prowess of its battle knights. His wise justice and pragmatic battle mastery have won him wide respect in the North. The phrase "fear the knights of Leilon" came from a joke about country bumpkins, but Lord Filmarya has turned it into a term of respect.</p>
