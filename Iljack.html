<p>Iljack of the Black Blade was a highwayman based in the village of Bambryn in the Vast some time after the 7 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the early Time of Glorious Fools , after humans first settled the central Vast in the midâ€“7 th century DR, Iljack of the Black Blade arose to plague the area. He robbed itinerant merchants and dwarven metal-dealers. Many sought to trap, ambush, and kill him, but Iljack always escaped, barely avoiding death many times. In retaliation, he would hunt down and assassinate those responsible, no matter how far he had to travel.</p>
<p>Finally, Iljack pursued a merchant to Procampur , but the merchant was due to marry a sorceress . Iljack caught his quarry in their bridal bed in their tower, but she rose and hurled him out of the window amidst a barrage of fireballs . Little more than ashes and a burning sword fell into the water below.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Iljack was a daring and vengeful bandit.</p>
<h2>Equipment</h2>
<p>Iljack wielded a dull black broadsword , from which he gained his moniker. It had magical powers that somehow allowed Iljack to escape many traps and ambushes.</p>
<p>He was widely thought to have hidden his loot somewhere in Bambryn, but it was never located by the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . Once, a tree fell over in a storm, revealing a stone marked with a black sword buried beneath. However, there was no treasure underneath, just another stone carrying the message "Moved it all. See me for your share." and another black sword symbol.</p>
