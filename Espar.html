<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Espar was located on the Way of the Dragon , sheltered by the King's Forest to its north. Before the space trees joined together to for the King's Forest, the hamlet was separate from it by lush green rolling hills. The folk of Espar were not numerous enough to make a dent into the tree-line, harvesting firewood. The highest hill was crowned with ruins of a stone cottage, so old, no-one actually know who build it. The structure was no big enough to be a keep but the locals called it simply the Stronghold . The ruins were a popular place for young and brave Esparran whipper-snappers.</p>
<p>The lush hills were the perfect graze pasture for Esparran sheep flocks.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
