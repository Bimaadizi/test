<p>The Dragon Eyrie was the home of the Draconic pantheon , manifesting as a vast mountain with its peak eternally covered in frost and surrounded by wispy clouds.</p>
<p>While the Dragon Eyrie was the home of all draconic deities, only Hlal , Null , Task , and Tiamat had permanent lairs on the plane.</p>
<h2>Dragon Eyrie Links</h2>
<p>There were several "soft borders" connecting Tiamat 's realm in the Dragon Eyrie with Avernus on the plane of the Nine Hells . Dragon Eyrie also contained links to Arvandor .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Around the mountain flew the spirits of departed dragons. Other departed souls whose destination was the Dragon's Eyrie included half-dragons , dragonkin , and other forms of dragonkind . Khaasta and abishai also dwelled on this plane, and living planar dragons of all kinds visited the Eyrie from time to time. A few hermit non-dragons also inhabited the plane, although dragons only tolerated them grudgingly.</p>
<h2>Divine Realms</h2>
<p>The mountain was divided into four major regions: the dark roots, the lower reaches, the middle crags, and the peak. With the exception of the peak—which was entirely Null's divine realm—the divine realms were small regions and didn't occupy the whole of any given region. Most of the mountain was open territory without claim from any deity, where the petitioners of the plane sought solitude.</p>
<h3>Hlal's Realm</h3>
<p>Hlal, trickster god and messenger deity, lived in the lower reaches with her brass dragon and copper dragon petitioners. The spirits of red dragons , blue dragons , and black dragons lived in various portions of the lower reaches as well.</p>
<h3>Null's Realm</h3>
<p>Null, god of death, ruled the entirety of the mountain's peak, along with white dragon and silver dragon petitioners attracted to the cold air and permanent snow cover.</p>
<h3>Task's Realm</h3>
<p>Task, god of greed, lived in the middle reaches in a volcanic region known as the Furnace. The spirits of red, gold, and bronze dragons lived here as well, attracted by the heat and lava.</p>
<h3>Tiamat's Realm</h3>
<p>Tiamat's realm, originally the realm of a god known as Azharul , also called the Dragonspawn Pits of Azharul but renamed by Tiamat into the Cave of Greed after she killed the god, was the home of the spirits of chromatic dragons who revered Tiamat above all others. Tiamat's realm existed in the depths of the plane, among the dark roots, where the spirits of shadow dragons and deep dragons also dwelt, and was somehow connected to her lair in Avernus.</p>
