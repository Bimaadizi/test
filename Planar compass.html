<p>Planar compasses were magical navigational tools that pointed in the direction of the nearest way to a particular plane , allowing users to locate interplanar gates .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Despite their name, these devices did not resemble mundane compasses , but rather were iron spheres measuring 6 inches (0.15 meters) in diameter. They were designed to be easily separated into two halves, revealing a hollow cavity that measured 4 inches (0.1 meters) in diameter, and equally rejoined with ease.</p>
<p>Another version existed: the planar compasses were made from orcanthium .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>After placing an object within the hollow cavity of a planar compass and rejoining its two halves, the instrument would proceed to spin around until eventually stopping, with a small arrow jutting out from one of its halves. This arrow pointed towards the direction of the nearest pathway to the plane from which the item originated, whether it be a gate, astral conduit , or elemental vortex . This effect remained active, the planar compass pointing unerringly, until either the device entered the planar destination or the object placed within it was removed.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the late 14 th century DR , a number of adventurers from Ravens Bluff came into possession of planar compasses . One of the first was a group tasked by either Alcides Von Tighe or Simon Regulus with delivering a planar compass , secured within a magical lockbox, to the githzerai sage A'Rinthorm as a substance held within it would aid in the sage's studies. Much later, another group had a compass offered to them in return for 5,000 gold pieces by Bob and Susan Nuhard , proprietors of the Gates of Hell Inn in the city of Dis . And finally, a group of adventurers were loaned a planar compass by the ruvkova Kharn after providing him positive energy , promising it would help lead them to the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Vacuum .</p>
