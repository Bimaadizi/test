<p>Kallos Tam was a necromancer and a Red Wizard of Thay in the late 15 th century DR , and the true menace behind the Blackdagger Bandits that raided the High Road on the Sword Coast North .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kallos Tam was one of a number of Thayan agents dispatched to the area around Neverwinter in the late 1470s DR , with the aim to cause trouble. He saw an opportunity in the Blackdaggers. Meeting their leaders, the brothers Traven and Malus Blackdagger , Kallos proposed to excavate and take control of the undead army within the Cragmire Crypts , giving them the army they desired to take over Neverwinter. Secretly, Kallos intended to retain control of the undead for himself, and thus the real power in the alliance. The brothers were receptive to his offer, only doubting if Kallos could do it or not.</p>
<p>Kallos proved he could. In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , he broke the magical seal of Cragmire Crypt and discovered inside some artifacts he was seeking, found the undead army still waiting there, and, he said, the means of controlling them. However, Traven did not fully trust Kallos and went with him and some of the Blackdaggers' best fighters into the crypts. The Harper agents Garl Gnarlclaw and Xalliana discovered the plot and recruited an adventurer to destroy the bandits. Xalliana went to hunt Kallos and Traven herself, but didn't return. A priest of Kelemvor also came to stop Kallos, and was slain in cold blood. In the end, Garl sent the adventurer and a party descended into the Cragmire Crypts, fought through both bandits and undead, and killed Kallos and Traven.</p>
