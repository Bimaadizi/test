<p>Ubergast was a sage living in Amn in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<p>Some time before 1356 DR , Ubergast observed that the informal handwriting in the untitled wizard's workbook known traditionally as Briel's Book of Shadows matched that in a letter from Briel stating his plan to found a school of wizardry in Baldur's Gate , preserved in the city's archive. This supported the supposed authorship of the book.</p>
