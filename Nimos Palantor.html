<h2>Personality</h2>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Nimos did not like nor trust his fellow captains in Darkhold. It may have been because their commander, the Pereghost , allowed him certain privilege's when it came to picking his archers from amongst any of the units of Darkhold, or because he was granted requests such as unlimited arrow supplies and even an order of arquebuses . He even had an arrangement with The Three to eliminate one of his fellow captains, Riviar Darkwind , if anything should happen to Pereghost if he did not shoot Riviar himself first.</p>
