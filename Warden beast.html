<p>Warden beasts were spiritual representations of non-magical animal groups found on the Beastlands plane , who embodied and personified their ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The appearance of warden beasts varied widely, with each resembling the animal they represent. However, they were always slightly larger and had the appearance of a perfect specimen of that animal. Some of the many animal groups that were known to have warden beasts included antelopes , bears , birds, deers , elephants , insects, lizards , and wolves .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Unlike the animal they represented, a warden beast had an average level of intellect, though they generally acted like those animals until some threat to their ward presented itself. They also would react to outsiders in the same manner as those animals.</p>
<p>A warden beast would take whatever steps were necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of the animals under its care. It would never have any concern for the greater good.</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>Unlike their animal charges, warden beasts were unaffected by the ravages of time and could live on indefinitely until slain.</p>
<h3>Reproduction</h3>
<p>Besides other warden beasts, these creatures were capable of reproducing with mundane animals and animal lords . However, the offspring would always be a warden beast.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Warden beasts possessed a magical empathy , being capable of sensing the true emotions of any creature around them. They were also tied on a primal level with their ecosystem, making them more than likely to become aware of any event that occurred within 5 mi (8,000 m) of their home. Because of this link they could contact any animal within that same radius on a basic level and issue basic actions, such as fleeing, calming down, or swarming. However, this was only done for dire emergencies.</p>
<p>Due to their spiritual nature, a warden beast possessed abilities similar to the following spells :</p>
<p>If they or their animal counterparts were seriously threatened, a warden beast could attempt to summon their applicable animal lord once per day.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Each warden beast fought in a similar manner to the animal they represented, though there was more power behind their attacks. They generally did not engage in combat and attempted to avoid, only doing so when it was necessary or in the best interest of the battles over which they had dominion. Warden beasts that represented predatory creatures, however, were a bit more likely to engage in combat.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Warden beasts acted as guardians, stewards, and leaders of the animal group they represented, holding dominion over them.</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>The dietary habits of warden beasts varied based on what animal they represented. Those that represented predatory species would similarly stalk and hunt prey in order to eat.</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>Warden beasts were capable of speaking both Common and the language of any animal.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>The deities of the upper planes , in particular those of the Beastlands, had little interference in the lives of warden beasts and they were often beneath their notice. Warden beasts in turn had little concern for the affairs of deities, humans , or other societies.</p>
<p>Warden beasts were a favored monster of the deities Haela Brightaxe , Thard Harr , and Rillifane Rallathil .</p>
