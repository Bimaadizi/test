<h2>Relatives</h2>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Iltharl enjoyed the arts, including sculpture, painting and music. He also enjoyed hosting parties and feasts. This led to the feeling that he did not make enough decisions, nor did he let others make them. He was also unable to have a child with his wife.</p>
<p>In 245 DR , just three years into his reign, Iltharl became aware of a plot to replace him by marrying his sister Gantharla to Kallimar Bleth and waiting for them to produce a male heir. This led him to reconsider his position as king, and chose to abdicate to Gantharla, making her the first queen of Cormyr, although this was not an easy thing for him to find the courage to do.</p>
<p>After abdicating, Iltharl joined the elves in Cormanthor where he would be able to pursue his interest in the arts.</p>
