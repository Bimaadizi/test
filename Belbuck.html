<p>Belbuck was a beer favored and brewed by halflings and the most popular Hin-brewed drink in Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It had a translucent green color and sweet and minty taste due to the fermented herbs from which it was brewed. Similar to spearmint , it cleansed other tastes from the mouth and like menthol it chilled the throat as it went down. It was deceptively potent and many inexperienced drinkers imbibed too much and quickly became too intoxicated to even walk out of the taproom that served them the popular libation.</p>
