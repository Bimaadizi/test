<p>Noradnar was a saint of the Church of Ilmater .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In his early life Noradnar worked as a slave-driver , but later on he took to heart the teachings of the Church of Ilmater. Taking up the life of a priest , Noradnar sought to teach others some means of defending themselves that didn't violate the Church's tenant of passive resistance.</p>
<p>Eventually Noradnar founded a hermitage out in the arid Calim Desert . There he taught a defensive style of martial arts, focused around disarming and disabling one's opponents, which would continue to be taught long after he passed away.</p>
