<h2>History</h2>
<p>One weekend in the late 1360s DR, Derrick Lurian joined a hunting trip in the nearby woods with several other nobles of Procampur, as well as Thultyrl Rendeth , ruler of the city. Derrick, Rendeth, Zinzann Allison , and others set off into the woods and caught a number of bucks , a griffin , and a peryton . However, a howl spooked Zinzann's horse, causing it to flee with rider deep into the woods. The others found him hours later, in shock and with shredded clothes, babbling and unable to say what had happened to him. Derrick related what had happened to the nobles who'd stayed behind, and Endoria Fairwelker later reported on the hunting trip in the Procampur Shining Jewel newspaper.</p>
