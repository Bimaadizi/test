<p>Avelyere , most often referred to as Lady Avelyere , was a diviner who ran a school (Coven) for young sorceresses in the Shade Enclave in 1469 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lady Avelyere had light gray eyes and brown hair. Although she was in her early 40s in 1468 DR , she still appeared young and beautiful.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1469 DR , Lady Avelyere's attention was drawn by Parise Ulfbinder and Draygo Quick to a talented young Bedine girl, who showed strong promise in the magical arts. She took her students out and used force to capture this girl, whose name was Ruqiah (actually the reincarnated Catti-brie ). Ruqiah became a student at the Coven and remained there for ten years. In 1479 DR , Lady Avelyere used a spell to force Ruqiah to reveal all her secrets, including her true identity and her intention to travel to Icewind Dale to find Drizzt Do'Urden . Lady Avelyere took that information to Ulfbinder and Quick. When Catti-brie discovered what had happened, she faked her own death in a fire and fled to the Silver Marches . Lady Avelyere continued to pursue Catti-brie using magical means, detecting her in Longsaddle in 1482 DR .</p>
