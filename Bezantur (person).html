<p>Bezantur was a high priest of Kossuth and the namesake of the Thayan city of Bezantur .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bezantur was the first high priest of Kossuth in the region of northern Mulhorand that would come to be known as Thay. He came to power sometime in or after the Year of Old Beginnings, âˆ’135 DR , when a Kossuthan shrine was constructed in Kensten on the site that would become the Flaming Brazier .</p>
<p>After the Flaming Brazier's clergy aided the Red Wizards of Thay 's conquest of Kensten in the Year of Fireslaughter, 932 DR , one of the ways in which the Thayans honored their new allies was to rename the city in Bezantur's honor.</p>
