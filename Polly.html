<p>Polly was once a living parrot with a sassy lip and colorful coat of feathers who later became a stuffed bird of Torleth's Treasures of Gillian's Hill .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1372 DR , Polly was a staple of Torleth Mindulspeer 's curio shop in Gillian's Hill. The bird was stuffed, displayed on a perch, and posed with its head to the side as if listening attentively to the store's many guests. A note was attached to Polly's claw which read: "Poor Polly! She mimicked the captain one too many times. May she perch in peace."</p>
