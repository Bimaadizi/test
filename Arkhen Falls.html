<p>The Arkhen Falls were the largest and most beautiful waterfall in all of the Dalelands . It was formed by a spring shooting out from Mount Thalagbror , cascading down the southern face of the northern ridge of the Thunder Peaks . The rushing waters emptied out into the gorge of the Arkhen Vale and formed the River Arkhen .</p>
<p>There was a legend that pegasi would flutter around the falls. Followers of Chauntea and Mielikki would travel to the falls in hope of catching a glimpse of these majestic beasts.</p>
<p>The rocky cliffs behind the falls were rich with valuable minerals such as copper and gem stones .</p>
