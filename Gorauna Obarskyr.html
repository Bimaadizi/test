<p>Gorauna Obarskyr was a politically powerful princess of Cormyr and the true power behind the throne during the Thronestrife period. A daughter of King Keldroun Obarskyr , she and the Purplethroat Plague caused numerous deaths in her own family, allowing her to control the line of succession.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Crimson Tiara, 303 DR , her brother, King Gorann Obarskyr , died of the Purplethroat Plague and the crown passed to his infant son, Edrae . Two years later, in the Year of the Barrows, 305 DR , Gorann's wife, Jalanthra killed Edrae to spare him from Gorauna's torments.</p>
<p>Upon Edrae's death, Gorauna's surviving brother Ulbaeram was crowned, reigning for three years before being slain by her husband Askran the Pretender in the Year of Promise, 308 DR . The crown then passed to Queen Silbran , Ulbaeram's wife, to protect the succession of her son Raerboth . Silbran reigned until the Year of the Bright Plumage, 320 DR , when she abdicated the throne in favor of her 14-year-old son.</p>
<p>Gorauna slew Raerboth in the Year of the Secret Slaughters, 326 DR , and the crown passed to his infant son, Baerildo , whom she killed two years later in the Year of the Ermine Cloak, 328 DR . At Baerildo's death, his uncle, Belmuth the Bastard , illegitimate son of Ulbaeram, took the throne. He reigned for six years before dying from the Purplethroat Plague in the Year of the Humbled Fiend, 334 DR . Upon his father's death, Sargrannon inherited the throne but was killed on orders from Gorauna by his uncle Ortolar , who took the throne in the Year of the Whipped Cur, 336 DR . Gorauna killed Ortolar a year later in the Year of the Chosen's Blade, 337 DR , and the throne passed to Sargrannon's younger brother Imbrus I , whom she killed in the Year of the Envenomed Bolt, 338 DR .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Vanished Foe, 339 DR , common-born Rathdar Orlenthar was appointed regent of the boy kings Artreth , Zoumdan , and Imbrus II . All three died of the Purplethroat Plague by the Year of the Black Wing, 341 DR , and Gorauna's granddaughter Meurthe the Mad took the throne.</p>
<p>Three more of her grandnieces and grandnephews would go on to have taken the throne and died after reigning for just one or two years by the Year of the Dagger, 348 DR .</p>
<p>She herself was killed by her great-grandson Thargreve Obarskyr the Greater , sometime before 360 DR .</p>
