<p>An artengak was a type of harpoon used by Angulutiun and Iulutiun hunters.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The artengak was designed specifically for seal hunting. An artengak possessed a slender profile compared to the unungak but shared a comparable bone tip. Its primary function was as a hunting tool. A lengthy cord was attached to the shaft, terminating in a loop that the hunter securely fastened around their wrist. This cord served the purpose of preventing the game from eluding the weapon, ensuring a successful capture.</p>
