<p>The Golden Apple was a locally-favoured tavern and an inn located in the Docks District of Neverwinter in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Golden Apple was a three-story building overlooking the Bay of Mists with a small plaza behind it. A sign was placed at the main entrance, advertising Apple's name and services.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Entertainment, food, and drinks were served on the inn's first floor, served by several serving women. The second floor was reserved for guest lodgings.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Golden Apple was an established and beloved business by the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . The inn survived the strife of that year: the plague of the Wailing Death and its quarantine that ravaged Neverwinter and the crumbling economy after the war between Luskan and Neverwinter. As the city recovered, locals returned to the tavern they missed so much during the quarantine. Some of the tavern's guests included the adventuring sailors called the Eater-of-Garm and Nisar Zayid of the Midnight Rose as well as the Rose's paying passenger, Lady Tasina Alcrest of Umberlee .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Circa 1372 DR, one of the serving minds who worked at the inn was a pleasant enough aging human woman named Gilda who greeted guests, directed them across the taproom, and escorted them to the second-floor lodgings.</p>
