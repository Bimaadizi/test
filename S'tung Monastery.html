<p>The S'tung Monastery , also known as S'tung Temple , was an ancient monastery in the Bashan Do Province of T'u Lung . Notably, it was where the powerful placards of the Edu'sascar were kept.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The S'tung Monastery stood in the southern Hills of Quai . No roads or trails connected it to surrounding settlements, though the city of Ha'chou in the north was the nearest.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The monastery was founded by its first abbot, a shukenja turned monk . His real name was lost to history, with only his posthumous title Sky Father recorded, in reference to his keen interest in astronomy .</p>
<p>In Shou Year 894 (−356 DR) , this abbot ordered his monks to create five high-quality placards, and they did so, creating the paper and ink from scratch, blessing the materials, and cutting the paper using a holy blade kept in the monastery. Once complete, the abbot carried them into the wilderness on a four-month long retreat. When he returned, he had painted powerful holy symbols upon them, creating the Edu'sascar.</p>
<p>In the centuries after, the monks of S'tung kept the Edu'sascar safe within their walls. Though they were stolen a few times, the thieves always returned them, in order to be rid of their deadly curse.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Each year on the winter equinox, the monks display the Edu'sascar from the monastery walls as part of a ceremony to honor the gods of the seasons . At such times, they held the placards up and cast their combined magics, causing colorful beams of light to sweep the sky with an appearance similar to an aurora.</p>
<p>The individual cards were used for various important purposes. The most valued was La, with its power to mass heal . The monks of S'tung carried it when they joined the armies of T'u Lung in battle, using it to heal and rally the troops.</p>
