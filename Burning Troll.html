<p>The Burning Troll was an inn in the Lower Port of Skullport .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Burning Troll was a building with three floors. It featured a dance floor and a clean kitchen.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Burning Troll was a popular gathering spot for adventurers, freebooters, and thrill-seekers who flocked to the tavern to share stories, sing bawdy songs, and indulged in lively tavern entertainment. It was renowned for its extensive selection of high-quality spirits, though prices are generally twice as high as those found in the Lands Above . Alcohol offerings were varied, of excellent quality, and nearly limitless, with prices ranging from high to exorbitant.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The establishment’s origins lied in an eventful skirmish involving its founders, former adventurers who destroyed a tribe of trolls notorious for ambushing caravans north of Skullport. After driving the trolls into Skullport and dismembering them, the adventurers faced the challenge of preventing the trolls’ regeneration. In a quick-thinking move, they soaked the remains in costly Sembian brandy and set them ablaze.</p>
<p>Once the fire was extinguished, the surviving adventurers toasted their victory amid the ashes, christening themselves the " Trollsinge Vanguard ." Using the treasure they had amassed in Undermountain , they established a tavern over the site and retired from adventuring. Since then, the Burning Troll has expanded, with a dance floor and a second and third story added, along with a kitchen staff to provide quality meals.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Of the original Trollsinge Vanguard, only two members remained: Ilyana Wyrmmruff and Eulagad the Maul . Following her retirement from adventuring, Ilyana Wyrmmruff took on the role of principal organizer at the Burning Troll. Her leadership and the reputation of the Trollsinge Vanguard played a crucial role in transforming the establishment into a reputable and bustling inn. Known for her meticulous management, Ilyana ensured the inn's larders were well-stocked, the wine cellar was filled with quality selections, and guest rooms were scrupulously maintained. Her aversion to spiders was well known among regular patrons, and her insistence on maintaining spider-free quarters reflected her attention to detail. Ilyana's health was in decline, suggesting that soon only Eulagad will remain to uphold the Vanguard’s legacy.</p>
<p>The inn was frequented by Irusyl Eraneth , a prominent information broker, who split her time between the Burning Troll and the Deepfires .</p>
