<p>The Morkoth was a sailing ship that was used by the Kraken Society to hold the storm giant King Hekaton captive in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Morkoth had an odd-looking hull that resembled a giant squid .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time after the War of the Silver Marches of 1485 DR , the Kraken Society used the Morkoth as a mobile prison for the storm giant King Hekaton. The ship regularly circled the Purple Rocks in the Trackless Sea .</p>
<p>After the Kraken Society agent Lord Khaspere Drylund betrayed the location of the Morkoth to adventurers, the kraken Slarkrethel decided to destroy the ship rather than allow Hekaton to be rescued.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Due to a spell cast on the ship by Slarkrethel, neither the ship nor anyone aboard it could be targeted by any form of divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.</p>
<h2>Crew</h2>
<p>The archmage Tholtz Daggerdark captained the Morkoth , while the half-orc assassin Rool served as his first mate. Twenty Kraken Society cultists crewed the vessel, while four merrow loyal to Slarkrethel escorted the vessel in the water.</p>
