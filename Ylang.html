<p>Ylang was a type of blossoming plant that could be found in certain regions of Shou Lung .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Blossoms of the ylang plant gave off a distinct and sickeningly sweet odor.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>Although the process was known to only a few, ylang blossoms could be pressed into an oil, that could be used to formulate a potent and permanent variety of love potion . The trick to this use was in the oil's potency, which was ensured by picking blossoms in the morning, rather than later in the day.</p>
<p>Regardless of its potency, ylang oil could also be used to create a variety of balms and teas .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the midâ€“14 th century DR , Minister Hsieh Han Liu of the Ginger Palace dealt in ylang blossoms, importing them to the Eastern Heartlands from Shou Lung via his ship, the Ginger Lady .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR , the dracolich Hethcypressarvil schemed to use oil made from the ylang blossoms imported to the Ginger Palace to creature a love potion that would force Yanseldara of Elversult to love him.</p>
