<p>The mosquito was a type of bloodsucking flying insect.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Mosquitoes enjoyed warm and humid environments, especially marshes and areas where water tended to form puddles, which they used as breeding areas.</p>
<p>Large populations of mosquitoes were found in the rimwood area of the forest of Cormanthor and in the Farsea Marshes in Cormyr . Mosquitoes the size of an adult human 's finger were also common throughout Chult , especially in humid areas.</p>
<p>These insects carried several diseases, including shivering sickness in Chult, and mosquito fever in Halruaa .</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Mosquitos were a blight on the nation of Payit . Swarms of mosquitoes were known to be thick enough to completely obscure one's vision, making it a challenge to traverse the Payitlan jungles as well as Far Payit 's depths.</p>
