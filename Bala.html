<p>Bala was a goddess of music in Zakhara and emphasized the importance of music to lift the spirit and mitigate suffering. She was a local goddess who was worshiped in the city of Mahabba , but her faith was outlawed and driven underground by the Pantheists . In this persecution her followers spread to other cities. Their sometimes violent resistance against their oppressors brought the goddess the epithet "of Ill Tidings".</p>
