<p>Grayclaws were a set of claw-like weapons favored by the Grayclaws thieves ' guild of Tantras , who took their name from these blades.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Grayclaws consisted of a set of leather gauntlets that strapped to the hand fitted with brass knuckles, from which projected razor-sharp blades. They were similar to the bagh nakh wielded in some eastern lands.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Grayclaws were a slashing weapon, lightly damaging but fast. A trained user could be dangerous in battle, and Grayclaws thieves, specialized in their use, could deliver a devastating sneak attack on their targets.</p>

However, they tended to hamper the wearer's hand movements in other areas, and they could not be donned or doffed quickly.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
