<p>Alexa was a drow wizard from Sshamath .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Alexa was one of the most promising apprentices in the College of Conjuration and the wife of Eldrinn Elpragh of the College of Divination .</p>
<p>In 1377 DR , Eldrinn proposed to Q'arlynd Melarn that Alexa join the new College of Ancient Arcana but Q'arlynd refused her because he feared that Eldrinn would gain too much power inside the new school.</p>
<p>However, for the time being, the site of the new school was the house of Alexa and Eldrinn, so she was casually involved in an experiment attempted by Q'arlynd to master a kiira . In the experiment, Q'arlynd found a clue to finding the mythical Kraanfhaor's Door magic school and understood that he must accept Alexa in the College of Ancient Arcana to buy her silence.</p>
<p>In 1379 DR , Alexa healed Master Q'arlynd and announced to him the death of Master Guldor Zauviir at the hands of Ilharess Laele Zauviir .</p>
<p>Later, together with her fellows, her husband, and the Masters Urlryn Khalazza , Seldszar Elpragh , and Masoj Dhuunyl , she helped Q'Arlynd when he engineered (with the aid of Eilistraee) the ritual that transformed all drow not tainted by Wendonai 's blood into brown-skinned dark elves . Afterward, they all relocated to Rhymanthiin .</p>
