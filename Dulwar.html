<p>Dulwar the Leatherworker was a male human who ran his own leatherwork business in Dagger Falls . He was a friend to and spy for Randal Morn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Dulwar was a thin, small, balding and lithe man well past his youth.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dulwar became well aquainted with Randal Morn and Mestin Durmark in his early years in southern Daggerdale when they would go on many profiable adventures together.</p>
<p>Dulwar moved to Dagger Falls roughly around 1359 DR from southern Daggerdale and set up his shop selling quality leather of all varieties. His goods were always popular with the locals of the town, even by the garrisoned Zhent soldiers during their occupation. However, during the time of Zhent rule, Dulwar used his cover as a tanner to help supporters of Randal Morn.</p>
<p>In 1369 DR , Dulwar helped Randal Morn reclaim Dagger Falls by using his shop as a place to relay information about troop movements and numbers. After the defeat of the Zhents by Randal Mornâ€™s forces Dulwar and his team of tanners worked closely with the priests of Lathander's Light in the rebuilding of their temple by moving supplies for them.</p>
<p>Even after the reclamation of the dale, Dulwar still operated as a spy for Randal Morn by 1372 DR .</p>
