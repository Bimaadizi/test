<p>Lord Aldon Kendrick was a member of House Kendrick and a distant cousin to High King Derid Kendrick of Callidyrr in the Moonshae Isles during the late 15 th century DR . He was betrayed and killed on a mission to Sarifal in the late 1470s DR.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was emaciated, and had a long neck with a big head. He had a weak chin, which was topped with a meticulously curled moustache. He wore his hair in a queue with the braid tucked beneath a velvet cap .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was vain, imperious, and naïve, believing that he was due great respect owing to his rank and family name. He believed in his own ability to inspire others, and tolerated no countermanding of his orders despite the fact that he often made the wrong decisions. He had little sense for when a situation required a firm hand or a flexible response. He was easily distracted by a beautiful woman.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Lord Aldon served as a solicitor in Caer Callidyrr , and worked out of a large stone guildhouse.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Although only a distant cousin to the king, Lord Aldon was not without rivals among the many Kendrick cousins, some of whom wished to see him dead.</p>
<p>He did not bother to learn the names of those he hired, and he refused to dine with them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lord Aldon was born circa 1450 DR .</p>
<p>Serving as a solicitor in the late 1470s DR, he was confronted with the question of whether to hang a golden elf adventurer known as " the Savage ", who had seduced the wife of a nobleman and convinced her to help him rob her husband. The Savage was a member of the crew of the Sphinx , and his captain, Lukas appealed to Lord Aldon on the elf's behalf. They ultimately struck a deal: the high procurator of the realm would strike the Savage's debt if the Sphinx transported Lord Aldon to the ruins of Caer Corwell within the fey realm of Sarifal to deliver a message to a group of human rebels known as the Winterglen Claw . Lukas accepted, although the deal seemed suspicious.</p>
<p>Lord Aldon perceived his mission to be straightforward and without risk: the Sphinx would sail to the island of Gwynneth and into port at Caer Corwell, where he would be greeted openly by Captain Rurik of the Winterglen Claw, who would swear an oath of loyalty to High King Derid in exchange for an indistinct promise of support in his rebellion. To the crew of the Sphinx , this seemed like a stupid and suicidal plan if not an obvious trap. However, Lord Aldon paid them no mind, ignoring their input and often sequestering himself from the rest of the crew in his cabin.</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Caer Corwell, Lord Aldon rehearsed his introductory speech before the party disembarked. They were greeted by an eladrin woman claiming to be a representative of Captain Rurik, and she invited the group to join her for refreshments. Again, the adventurers knew this to be an obvious trap, but the more experienced among them—including Lukas and the Savage—also realized that this fey entity had already captured them. They did not stop the clueless Lord Aldon from partaking in the wine offered to him, which left him catatonic and gasping for air. The fey maiden then killed him. She subsequently revealed herself to be High Lady Ordalf , the queen of Sarifal, and indicated that Lord Aldon's rivals within House Kendrick had concocted their mission in order to get Lord Aldon killed.</p>
<p>Although Lord Aldon's mission was a trap, it remained true that King Derid was interested in establishing contact with the Winterglen Claw, although Captain Rurik appeared to already know this when one crewmember of the Sphinx , Suka , encountered him a tenday after Lord Aldon's death.</p>
