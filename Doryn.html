<p>Doryn No-Mouth was a male human and one of the four staff of The Rapids inn in Teshwave in 1367 DR , working as a stableboy and handyman.</p>
<p>He was a young, fair-faced lad of around 17 years, but he was mute. Doryn was frequently harassed by the Zhentilar because of his particular condition, and they called him "Doryn No-Mouth". However, he was very observant and had the ability to read and write, a skill that the Zhents were not aware he possessed. Tula Woodsbridge looked out for him.</p>
