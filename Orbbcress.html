<p>Orbbcress (or Spiderweb ) was a shield belonging to Tiago Baenre .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The shield had grips formed like black spiders with blue sapphire eyes. Like Tiago's sword Vidrinath , it was formed of translucent material that was spotted with diamond stones. It was made of glassteel .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The shield could defeat some magical energy. When Tiago willed it, weapons stuck to his shield as if it were a spiderweb. It could also magically enlarge, spinning around to cover a larger area.</p>
<p>Tiago was able to attach the shield to a surface and hang from it (although perhaps only for a short time).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The legendary weaponsmith Gol'fanin forged Orbbcress in Gauntlgrym for Tiago in 1463 DR .</p>
<p>Following a duel with Drizzt Do'Urden that resulted in Tiago's death, Drizzt obtained Tiago's sword, Vidrinath , and shield, Orbbcress . Catti-brie combined both Bruenor 's foaming-mug shield with Orbbcress using the magic of a primordial , with the resulting shield keeping the ability to produce dwarven holy water and Orbbcress' s magical enchantments.</p>
