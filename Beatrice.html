<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She was a cousin of King Azoun IV and the wife of Grodoveth . However, Grodoveth committed a wanton indiscretion (rumored to involve a prostitute in a Suzail tavern) that not only dishonored himself but embarrassed the throne and saw him exiled from the city as a lowly envoy by 1367 DR , and perhaps fortunately left Beatrice alone.</p>
