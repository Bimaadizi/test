<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a gang assembled by Churg Elvek , secretly a cultist of the Absolute , sought to strengthen the cult's grasp on Baldur's Gate. When the famed writer Volothamp Geddarm returned to the Gate after misadventures in the Emerald Grove and coming face-to-face with the Absolute's army, Volo became a target for Churg and his gang. The master traveler was captured and tied to a stack of smokepowder barrels, ready to be "brought to justice" for being an alleged agent of the Absolute at the hands of the gang and street gawkers. Rabbelle was one of the commoners in the gathered crowd, who was swayed by Churg Elvek's accusations and called for the writer's blood. Luckily, the band known as the Absolute Adversaries interrupted the street execution.</p>
