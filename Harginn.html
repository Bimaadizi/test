<p>Harginns ( pronounced : / h ɑːr ˈ g ɪ n z / har-GINZ ), or flame horrors , were grue native to the Elemental Plane of Fire .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>All harginns could assume several different forms including a regular bonfire, a pillar of flame, or a bronzed humanoid . When seen on the Prime Material Plane , harginns appeared like humans with flames replacing their legs and lower torso. Harginn eyes glowed with an eerie black light that represented their evil reputation well. They could easily change the color of their flames to suit their mood.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>While in combat, harginns preferred to move about quickly and strike with gouts of flame. They made extensive use of their ability to blink at will. Some harginns used weapons in combat.</p>
<p>Harginns were completely immune to any fire -based spell, and a harginn within 20 ft. of a fire-based spell would automatically dispel it, including spells with permanent effects. This did not affect magical items.</p>
<h2>Habitat/Society</h2>
<p>Harginns organized themselves into guilds composed of a tiered hierarchy where guilds with more power ordered around those beneath them. These orders were not always followed, causing frequent conflict between harginns. Within each guild both sexes had their assigned roles.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>The vast majority of harginns played the role of servants or slaves of the efreet . Bands of harginns did exist who roamed the seas of flame on the Elemental Plane of Fire. These harginns were usually on bad terms with the efreet and other races of the plane.</p>
<h2>Pirate Harginn</h2>
<p>Clans of pirate harginns did exist. They were hated by nearly every other race on the Elemental Plane of Fire. They often sold slaves to the City of Brass . Azers were known to bribe harginn pirates to allow their ships safe passage.</p>
