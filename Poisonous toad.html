<p>Poisonous toads (or poisonous frogs — the terms were more or less interchangeable ) were a species of giant toad whose bodies secreted a weak, hemotoxic poison .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These creatures were largely indistinguishable from the most common, mundane species of giant toad. Like any species of toad, their skin was consistently dry, rough to the touch, and marked by many warts.</p>
<p>Those referred to as "frogs" typically were smaller in size.</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>By biting creatures, these toads passed on a poison that sent victims into a comatose state. Their victims would die within twenty-four hours unless treated. Prior to the Time of Troubles , scholars had believed that the poison of their bite was far deadlier.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Besides their poisonous bite, these toads fought with their tongues like any other.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>These creatures lived in colonies of up to eight members.</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Poisonous toads were a carnivorous species.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Poisonous toads typically inhabited regions with a warm to temperate climate, sometimes living underground. Like any species of giant toad, they lived near bodies of water where they could lay their eggs.</p>
<p>On Toril they were known to inhabit the marshes of Cormyr , including the Farsea Marshes , Marsh of Tun , and Vast Swamp .</p>
