<p>Eshayben was a ghost priestess of Shar who haunted Renkilk's Cranny in the Trielta Hills during the late 14 th century DR.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In life, Eshayben had been an Illuskan human. As a ghost , when manifested, she appeared as a frenetic woman with ash-colored hair and matching robes, with glowing red eyes. She was unable to move, but was able use a telekinetic aura to magically grab or throw objects.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Eshayben was originally a priestess of Shar located in Skullport whose cell was destroyed. Seeking to regain Shar's favor, she followed cryptic orders from her superiors to go south to Renkilk's Cranny in the Trielta Hills near the village of Triel .</p>
<p>After clearing the cavern of the ogres that inhabited it, she discovered that it contained a dead-magic zone . She then set up a secure base within the cavern using the dead-magic zone as part of her defenses. However, despite her precautions and secrecy, her base was discovered by Red Wizard evokers and she was killed by them outside of the dead-magic zone. Shar chose to grant her priestess's dying curse and allowed her to immediately rise as a ghost, who slew the already weakened Red Wizards. However, Shar was displeased with Eshayben's loss and the priestess was returned as barely sapient and unable to move, utterly fixated on the sole purpose of possessing and controlling magical items . Those that did not wear magical items or have a magical aura were able to move around her without her perceiving them. Those that she perceived to be holding magical items she would attack violently, attempting to take the magical items while endlessly repeating a mantra of "I move not, I need not; What comes here Moves for me."</p>
<p>Some time after her death, a Coiled Cabal yuan-ti expedition led by a yuan-ti bard named Sseselheve fought Eshayben. After surviving the encounter, they made the ghost priestess part of their new lair's defenses.</p>
