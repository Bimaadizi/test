<p>The Tower of the High Wizard Netheril was a mage's tower in Freedale in the Dalelands .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The tower lay out of the way, but still close to Freedale.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The tower had three floors.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Each of the tower's floors was a single room holding no end of arcane implements: books, notes, and glassware. The first floor held his office, while the rest were private chambers: the second floor was sleeping quarters, the third floor was storage, and the fourth was his secret laboratory. However, there were a number of rooms cluttered with arcane implements on each floor.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Inside, Netheril cast spells for those who paid, and sometimes sold minor magic items or spells.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Three guards protected the tower: Major Domo , Fortu , and Deval .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , Netheril called upon local adventurers to rescue Taran Goldenstar from the Tomb of Damara near Freedale. He met them at his tower. If they succeeded, he may have asked them afterwards to find and recover the orb of dragonkind , again at his tower.</p>
