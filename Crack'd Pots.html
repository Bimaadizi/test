<p>Crack'd Pots was a shop in the Central Trade Lanes of Skullport in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Crack'd Pots was a one-story builing in poor condition.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The shop offered a variety of crudely shaped ceramic and clay vessels, basins, and urns, all produced with minimal concern for aesthetics. Despite their unattractive appearance, these items remained surprisingly functional and were sold at inexpensive prices.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Crack'd Pots was owned by Estellia Vizen , who claimed to have been born in Skullport nearly a century ago. Her advanced age, coupled with her clay-caked demeanor, lent some credence to her assertion. Estellia attributes her longevity to the properties of the clay she harvested from certain banks along the Sargauth .</p>
