<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 767 DR , by the end of winter and the start of spring, the High Duchy of Langalos became haunted by an enigmatic entity known as the Slayer. Though High Duke Horostos had posted a great reward for it, and sent even war bands of his own men, no-one succeeded. Even after sending a band of adventurers, the Frostfire Banner , nothing that entered the forests where the Slayer resided returned.</p>
<p>After running out of ideas and finding no more adventurers willing to investigate, High Duke Horostos was informed by his seneschal that the Harpers were going to investigate. Though the Duke didn't take kindly to it, he was open to at least waiting on the results of their investigation.</p>
<p>Just after the Slayer was laid low while attacking Elminster Aumar , a Chosen of Mystra , the High Duke tried instead sending a huge, armed caravan through the forest to see what would happen.</p>
