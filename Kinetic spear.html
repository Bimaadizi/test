<p>The kinetic spear was a unique enchanted polearm created by the philosopher wizard named Giddeon the Believer‎ sometime in the late 10 th or early 11 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Giddeon's kinetic spear was a light 2 pounds (0.91 kilograms) spear that possessed a strong +2 enchantment that guided the wielder's arm and increased the weapon's damage. Additionally, the weapon was ensorcelled to tap into lines of latent natural magical power that permeated the world, channeling the magic through the shaft, exploding its tip with a violent crushing force, similarly to the effects of the lance of disruption spell .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The kinetic spear was the result of Giddeon's research into "currents" of natural magical energy that existed all throughout Toril . The weapon functioned as a "focus device," allowing a non-mage wielder to harness its destructive power. Giddeon's kinetic spear was one of the very few items to survive a massive explosion of the mage's laboratory in the Year of Three Signs, 1010 DR . The weapon found its way into the frigid lands of Icewind Dale by the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR . It belonged to a hin cleric Quinn Silverfinger of Waukeen who led The Golden Lodge shrine in Lonelywood .</p>
