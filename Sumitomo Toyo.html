<p>Sumitomo Toyo was the heir and chef of Doi No Fugu in 1360 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Toyo was the younger son of Sumitomo Koji , master of the Doi No Fugu. In his youth, he was very close to his older brother, Sumitomo Yoichi , who was always fascinated by stories of travelers, and his younger sister Sumitomo Skoshi .</p>
<p>When, as tradition dictated, Yoichi was sent outside Maeshi Province for training as a chef, Toyo and Skoshi knew he would never come back. He didn't, and Toyo became the heir. With the turmoil in the province between the Michimori clan and the Korimori clan , he undertook his training at home.</p>
<p>In 1359 DR , the ronin Haka Kinnori arrived at the inn. After a talk with their father, Koji, he started to live with them. Soon Toyo and Skoshi befriended Haka, who also taught them karate .</p>
