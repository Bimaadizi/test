<p>Iron cobras were a type of serpentine construct . They were favored by the Scaled Ones for their snakelike form.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These constructs were typically made of iron , though some consisted of unknown metals.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Iron cobras were activated and de-activated by their masters through use of command words . When activated an iron cobra obeyed simple commands; while de-active, an iron cobra was completely silent. Additionally, when ordered by their creator to track down a creature (whose name must be known to the creator), they could detect its position as if by the locate creature spell . Some described this ability of theirs as them honing in on their target's psychic vibrations and that they could be blocked by spells such as mind blank .</p>
<p>Despite their size and metal forms, iron cobras were surprisingly stealthy.</p>
<p>Their bodies possessed a magic resistance and could see in areas of total darkness out to a range of 60 feet (18 meters). They were immune to spells that affected the mind and some were unaffected by the spell web . They could not be harmed by non-magical weapons unless they were made of adamantine .</p>
<h3>Offensive</h3>
<p>Iron cobras were venomous, with an internal reservoir that held three doses of poison, though said reservoir could be refilled in but a minute. The exact type of poison varied, although venom from a monstrous spider was a common choice. Some loaded them with alchemical concoctions that paralyzed creatures or clouded their minds with paranoia .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Iron cobras' combat tactics were simple, but typically effective: bite until the enemy died.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>As constructs, they had little to no effect on their surrounding environment, and could be found in any land ecosystem.</p>
<h3>Creation</h3>
<p>Iron cobras could be created from 100 pounds (45,000 grams) of iron by a caster of above-average skill who could cast both arcane and divine spells. The creation process also required use of the spells animate object , freedom of movement , geas/quest , and locate creature .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was said that the first eight iron cobras were created ages ago by a powerful wizard-cleric, and that they were indestructible. Other spellcasters after them tried to copy the design, but with uniformly less powerful results. Others believed that they were a gnomish invention and grouped them in with other gnomish constructs known as clockworks .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Some claimed that there were only a dozen or so iron cobras in existence.</p>
