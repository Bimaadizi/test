<p>Marlyar Nilthrul was a shopkeeper that sold imported perfumes, bath oils, and herbal scents in the city of Delzimmer in southeast Faerûn circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Marlyar was a butterball of a man who obviously enjoyed the fruits (and meats and sweets) of his labor as a successful merchant. He had a mustache that grew like his waistline—toward his waistline.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was friendly, quick to laugh, and had a reputation of showing ladies a good time. His nickname around town was "Mighty Marlyar".</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Marlyar's reputation as a consort vied with two other, very different men in town: the tall and muscular Thorongh Davarragar , and the suave and ambitious Imriskril Melsamber . But, as gossip inflates itself with its own hot air, these three were soon dubbed the "Night Scourges" and tales of their exploits abounded, each more outrageous than the last. There was little truth to the rumors, but some women put their own spin on the stories, either to deprecate a rival or bolster their own standing, and this alarmed many husbands and fathers who began to shadow the three Scourges, carrying weapons openly and staring intently. Mighty Marlyar had never been caught doing anything resembling the wild gossip and was guilty of nothing more than a little vain boasting.</p>
