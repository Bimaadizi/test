<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ito Gohei was a dwarf retainer of the Ito family who died in the castle's burning in 647 DR . Thanks to an ancient curse and a krakentua 's influence, he did not truly die and instead continued to haunt the castle as the sixth of the seven weapon masters. Finally, in 1360 DR, an adventuring party hired by Michimori Uemon to recover the Seven Swords fought and destroyed him.</p>
