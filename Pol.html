<p>Pol , or Brother Pol , was a knight, wizard , and cleric of Helm at Watcher's Keep in Amn .</p>
<p>The god Helm gave Pol and his fellow knights the task of sealing Demogorgon inside the keep. Knowing it was a difficult mission, his leader, Odren , recruited Gorion's Ward to work for him. Pol gave Gorion's Ward the Vigil Stone , which he needed to enter the keep.</p>
