<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Inshula spent most of her life traveling and hunting alongside her sister Kwesi. Her animal companion was a pitch-black fierce panther named Areghaeb .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Inshula and Kwesi sar Mashewe were huntresses in training from the city of Tashluta . The women honed their skills in tracking dangerous beasts. In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the sisters traveled by sea to the hidden nation of Samarach and organized hunting expeditions from the city of Samargol . Their goal was to become stronger and more experienced to travel back home to Chult across the dangerous mountains that separated the two regions of the Chultan Peninsula . During one of their hunts, the sisters came across a legendary giant dire boar Bal'alak . Inshula and Kwesi showered the beast with bolts but could not slay it. Retreating, Kwesi was injured and was forced to make a living dispensing bounties for monster parts in Samargol at the behest of the city's guards as she healed. Inshula, however, was still willing to hunt beasts and offered her services to traveling adventurers. Unlike Kwesi, Inshula was impatient and did not want to deal with Samargol's governors, thinking them cowards.</p>
<p>Eventually, Inshula sar Mashewe traveled to the Sword Coast and spent some time hunting there. However, with time she developed a longing for home and subsequently reunited with Kwesi, and they both returned to Tashluta.</p>
