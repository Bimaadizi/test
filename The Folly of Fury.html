<p>The Folly of Fury was a tome dedicated to the dogma of the Church of Eldath and its contrast with the so-called Gods of Fury , published sometime before 1281 DR .</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>The book was penned from the perspective of the pacifist worshipers of Eldath , the Goddess of Shining Waters. The author compared the principles of their church to those of those fundamentally opposed to it—the churches of Malar , Talos , Umberlee , and Auril , collectively known as the Gods of Fury. The followers of Eldath rejected violence and practiced selflessness, while Aurilites, Malarites, and Talassans were selfish, physically abusive, and destructive. The author stated that the Malarites cared only about showing power through butchering of beasts, the Aurilites reveled in inflicting death through exposure to freezing temperatures, the Talassans mindlessly destroyed for pleasure, and the Umberlants spread fear and chaos in the seas.</p>
<p>The The Folly of Fury posed a question in conclusion: what kind of afterlife the followers of the Gods of Fury were to expect from such evil and selfish deities?</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , a copy of The Folly of Fury was stored in the library of the Eldathyn monastery within the Dragon's Eye on the Spine of the World , which was secretly a yuan-ti ruse. By the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , several copies of the book could be found in the Ten-Towns of Icewind Dale .</p>
