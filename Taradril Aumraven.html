<p>Taradril Aumraven was a member of the Zhentarim in Darkhold in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR and a former Lord of Zhentil Keep .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Taradril had a mercantile view of the Zhentarim and for this he supported Sememmon as the main Zhentarim leader. He viewed Sememmon as a more stable and capable leader than Manshoon , whom Taradril thought too involved in secrets to have real perception of the liking of the Zhentish people.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Taradril was a merchant wizard in Zhentil Keep and, thanks to his power, gained a seat on the Council of Lords. He often opposed Manshoon's proposal in the Council and tried to did the best for all Zhentil but Aumraven was sometimes double-crossed by Manshoon, as about the rebuilding of Citadel of the Raven .</p>
<p>During the destruction of Zhentil Keep by Cyric 's horde in 1368 DR , only the timely assistance of Sememmon saved Taradril's life. He was tasked with rebuilding the Zhentarim mercantile trade through Darkhold. For this, Taradril often clandestinely collaborated with Lady Alicia of the Citadel of the Raven for control the caravan trade in the Anauroch .</p>
<p>Taradril's estate was located in the central section of Zhentil Keep's Inner Quarter on the Lord's Way and Flostren's Memory .</p>
