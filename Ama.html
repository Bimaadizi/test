<p>Ama was a nun of the Lords of Creation of the Kuong Kingdom in Malatra in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Quite aged, her face was wrinkled and her smile toothless. She wore several gold bracelets.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Ama performed divinations with the gizzards of beasts and joss sticks . She claimed to know the future and much of what went on in the present moment across Malatra. Circa 1357 DR , Ama even advised the chief diviner to the high priest of the kingdom, Malvaya .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At that time, Ama provided an overview of the peoples and nations of Malatra to a visitor from another land, but her account was colored by her prejudices. She thought those outside the Kuong Kingdom to be "barbarians" of "so-called kingdoms". She claimed the Rippling Grass tribe of Purang were the laziest of the Purang people . She disliked that Devuri , a crayfish hengeyokai , was appointed priest at the Kataburi temple and thought he wasted too much of his time in the river. She was also suspicious of the Mahatsureya temple's practices. Moreover, she even thought the Path of Enlightenment was a false religion. She did concede that the people of Buyan were "adequate" pearl-divers, "for Seng ".</p>
