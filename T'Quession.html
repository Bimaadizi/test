<p>T'Quession was a sea elf hamlet in the Deepwater Harbor of Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The hamlet was founded in 1367 DR , after the sea elves were driven from their homes by the Army of Iakhovas . The newly settled sea elves petitioned to join Waterdeep's City Guard , though only some were allowed to join. The other sea elves continued to act as merchants, selling seafood and other undersea treasures.</p>
<p>The people of T'Quession would later fight alongside Waterdeep in the Deepwater War , suffering significant losses in their population in the process.</p>
