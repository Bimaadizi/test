<p>The Upper Trade Lanes of Skullport was the highest level of the Trade Lanes.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Upper Trade Lanes were a dimly lit, shadowed expanse where the cavern ceiling nearly brushed the tops of the tallest buildings. Jagged stalactites descended from above, obstructing light and casting deep pools of darkness across the thoroughfare. This perpetual gloom provided an atmosphere of secrecy and discretion, making the area a favored location for clandestine meetings and covert dealings, where business could be conducted without interference.</p>
<p>The establishments operating in this sector reflected its enigmatic nature, catering to a clientele that thrived in the shadows. Patrons found themselves in the company of illithids , drow , and other light-sensitive species, each engaged in their own quiet transactions. Conversations here was kept strictly to business, and inquiries beyond "How much does this cost?" was neither encouraged nor welcomed.</p>
