<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He was a guard in Castle Obarskyr .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Rorskryn Mreldrake fled Castle Obarskyr through a portal to the King's Tower in Marsember , transformed into a woman, he was spotted at the portal by the War Wizard Ellard Gauntur , who'd been deployed to capture him. Ellard figured out that was Mreldrake transformed from a stain on his clothes, and pursued. Two sentries were deployed by the War Wizard Ellard Gauntur on the Marsember side of the portal: Berent Thallowwood and Mandron Saldar , so that Rorskryn could not return easily.</p>
<p>While the two sentries speculated, the vampire archmage Manshoon sent after them the death knight Targrael ; she quickly slew Berent without him even noticing.</p>
