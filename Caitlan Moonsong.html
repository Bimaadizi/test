<p>Caitlan Moonsong was an innocent teenage girl that lived in Cormyr during the mid–14 th century DR that, through no choice or decision of her own, she played a critical role in the struggles between the gods in the world-shaping event known as the Time of Troubles . She briefly served as the avatar for the goddess Mystra before their shared destruction.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was a waifish girl that looked thin and near-starved, no more than 15 years old during the time of her adventures.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Aspects of Caitlan's personality seemed to contradict one another. While she was still a child often acted as such, at times she showed wisdom learnedness well beyond her years.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Avatar Crisis in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , the goddess Mystra was trapped by the God of Strife Bane at Castle Kilgrave in Cormyr . Mystra used a unique geas spell to compel Caitlan Moonsong to seek out a suitable avatar for her in the form of the magic-user Midnight , along with "worthy warriors" to aid her in this quest.</p>
<p>After a tiring and single-minded search for Midnight, Caitlan came upon the gruff mercenary Kelemvor Lyonsbane in Arabel and deemed him worthy enough. As Caitlan shared with Kelemvor and his allies Adon and Cyric about her mistress' peril, By chance or fate, Midnight confidently joined their table and Caitlan became immediately transfixed to her amulet, which held a portion of Mystra's essence. The close proximity to the goddess of Magic's power, caused Caitlan to collapse, and Kelemvor took the young girl over Zehla at the Hungry Man inn to rest and recover. After waking up, Caitlan demanded that Kelemvor take Midnight with them on their journey and would not accept any objection.</p>
<p>The group left Arabel in short time an rode out, passing through weird and unfamiliar landscape that had been altered by changes in the Weave due to the absence of Mystra. Due to the lack of recognizable landmarks, the group became lost and Caitlan herself stopped speaking, stricken with fear at the effects wild magic had on the natural world.</p>
<p>While Kelemvor, Midnight and the others were asleep, Mystra offered Caitlan the means to fly to Castle Kilgrave at once, as the non-corporeal form of the goddess was alone in a cell with the monstrous avatar of Bane. Caitlan snuck into the castle with ease and witnessed a confrontation between the two gods. When Caitlan's companions awoke to find her missing, they immediately set out for pursuit towards Castle Kilgrave.</p>
<p>The group of adventurers battled through their respective personal demons while venturing through Bane's domain, but reunited unscathed and quickly made their way to find Caitlan and Mystra. The proximity of Midnight's necklace empowered the goddess of magic and gave her the strength to merge her incorporeal form and Caitlan's soul into the young girl's body and wound Bane's avatar to where he had to flee. Taking back her essence in Midnight's amulet, Mystra was reunited with the Weave .</p>
<p>The goddess of magic remained within Caitlan's body and reshaped it in her preferred image. Mystra marched upon the Celestial Stairway but was ultimately destroyed by Ao 's chosen guardian Helm . Caitlan Moonsong was no more.</p>
