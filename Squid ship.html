<p>Squid ships , formally cephalopod-class brigs , were squid-shaped spelljammers . Because of their simple design, ease of use and maneuverability, they were very popular vessels among traders and explorers.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Squid ships merged elements of seafaring sailing ships with the elegant and functional design of nautiloids . Their simple design allowed squid ships to be operated by a relatively small crew. When employed for trading purposes, squid ships typically held a minimum complement of 12 individuals. When in space, the ship could support a maximum complement of 45 individuals without compromising its air supply.</p>
<p>On a typical squid ship manned by a human crew, the bridge and captain's post was located in the aftcastle, with the spelljamming helm hidden underneath. Communication between the captain and helmsman was attained via speaking tubes.</p>
<p>Squid ships were primarily employed for trading and adventuring purposes, although their powerful ram and maneuverability also made them favored by pirates and military navies.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was rumored that squid ships were originally designed by humans who had escaped slavery by mind flayers . This was due to their combination of human and illithid designs.</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , the Morkoth , a sea-bound squid ship, was employed by the Kraken Society as a prison for king Hekaton .</p>
<p>Around the same time, the Scavenger , a large 290‑foot-long (88‑meter) squid ship, was captured by Halaster Blackcloak while orbiting Toril and trapped in Undermountain . Halaster stole the ship's helm and left the crew marooned within the dungeon.</p>
