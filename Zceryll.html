<p>Zceryll was a magician who had lived millenia before the 14 th century DR . She had communed with powers of the Far Realm and created a number of artifacts in her time, becoming a vestige since. As a vestige, she sought to re-enter the Realms.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Those who summoned Zceryll described her manifestation as a swarm of mirrors, which briefly reflected a beautiful human woman, though something was amiss about her features. After this initial impression, these mirrors reflected a mass of writhing tentacles.</p>
<p>People who bound the vestige to their own flesh and failed to conceal the sign had their eyes appearing as circular mirrors.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Zceryll had found a purpose in life fighting against oppression. However, due to the corruptive effects of the star-spawn she dealt with, she slowly became a twisted and bitter old hag who felt she had accomplished nothing, and became obsessed with youth. Other sources called her an irreedeemable megalomaniac who valued her own life and youth above all else, having sacrificed family to unknowable beings in pursuit of those goals and eventually turning into a vestige, which transformed her into a being of pure depravity.</p>
<p>Binders who were not in full control of the binding, falling under her influence, could never admit that they were weaker than anyone else, and treated those they perceived as weaker with scorn and contempt, young women and spontaneous spellcasters in particular.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Zceryll may have been an alienist sorcereress or a warlock . She had been described as grafting alien flesh on her own and unleashing plagues of madness, creating gates and portals to summon her star-spawn masters into the world, and creating other kinds of items.</p>
<p>As a vestige, Zceryll granted her binders a powerful form of telepathy that allowed them to precisely pinpoint each intelligence, and even the kind of creature being detected. Their minds in turn became alien, granting immunity to confusion , insanity , and weird alongside a more general resistance to any effect upon their minds. Their flesh was rendered that of an aberration as well, turning the binder into a pseudonatural entity. Binders of greater power were capable of attacking with rays that briefly dazed enemies, and those whose craft had advanced beyond that point were capable of freely summoning pseudonatural versions of the entities which summon monster spells would summon.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>At some point, Zceryll had created a number of artifacts , including the bone scepter of Zceryll , the star-spawn scepter , the aberrant spheres , the black blood kaleidoscope and the rod of Taupanga . She had whispered clues to those who bound her as a vestige to guide them towards her creations.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Besides grafting alien flesh on herself, unleashing plagues of madness, creating gates and portals to summon her star-spawn masters into the world, and creating other kinds of items, Zceryll had sacrificed friends and family to her masters amongst other such unspeakable atrocities.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Zceryll was said to have friends and family, some of which she sacrificed to her masters.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thousands of years ago, Zceryll learned bizarre powers in order to defend herself from oppression. She made deals with strange entities known as star-spawn, creating portals through which they may be summoned. When her time was up, her soul went to the Far Realms, where she became a vestige.</p>
