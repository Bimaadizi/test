<p>The Circle of the Shepherd was the collective of druids in the Realms that forged especially strong bonds with beasts of the wild, fey creatures, and Spirits of the natural world. Druids of this circle were individually known as shepherds .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>These druids made every effort to cast out predatory monsters from their lands, admonish greedy hunters who slew more than was necessary, and like other druids, keep at bay the encroachment of civilization upon the natural world.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Circle of the Shepherd druids focused of protecting defenseless animals and fey beings in context of natural cycles of life and death. They viewed themselves as guardians and caretakers of the innocent creatures under their charge. In rare instances, these druids took it upon themselves to protect innocent people, typically from among the common folk of the Realms.</p>
<p>They often preferred to live out in the wild, nearer to the animals for which they cared and further away from dense population centers.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Druids of the Circle of Shepherd learned early on how to speak with beasts and fey. They gained fluency in the Sylvan language and came to understand the meaning of gestures, noises, and body language made and exhibited by wild animals.</p>
<p>They gained the power to summon nature spirits to their aid, specifically those of either bears , hawks , or unicorns . These spirits created an aura around them that enhanced the abilities of the druid and their allies. More experienced druids could direct these nature spirits to protect their charge animals. Similarly, either the druids or their nature spirits could bolstered the life force of any creature they conjured by magical means.</p>
<p>The most powerful druids could call upon their summoned nature spirit to protect them during times of greatest need. If they were ever incapacitated or knocked unconscious, a group of beasts would appear within moments and protect them with their lives.</p>
