<p>Tanner Cymrych was a High King of the Moonshae Isles in the first half of the 10 th century DR . He would become the last monarch to hold the true title of High King until the ascension of High Queen Alicia Kendrick over four centuries later.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was a member of the Cymrych Dynasty and the second son of his predecessor, High King Byron Cymrych II . His son and heir was Niall , who would go on to end the Cymrych Dynasty by renaming it to the Carrathal Dynasty .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Niall assumed the throne of the High King in the Year of the Queen's Tears, 902 DR , following the death of his father. He inherited a High Kingship that was severely weakened owing to the loss of the Crown of the High King by his great-grandfather .</p>
<p>In the forty-second year of his reign , his grip on the Moonshae Isles shattered when he conceded the northern islands to the " Northmen ", who had invaded and settled them over the preceding century.</p>
<p>That same year, he led his men to combat a giant incursion in the Myrloch Vale led by a firbolg chief. Although his forces prevailed, Tanner himself was slain, and his legendary Sword of Cymrych Hugh —a symbol of the office of High King—was carried off by his enemies as they retreated. As a result, his son was unable to maintain the authority of the High King, and his domain shrank to include only the realm of Callidyrr .</p>
<p>The Sword of Cymrych Hugh would remain lost until it was recovered centuries later by Tristan Kendrick .</p>
