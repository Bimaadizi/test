<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In 1373 DR , Pyras was in his early 30s. Pyras had hazel eyes, and his most noticeable feature was a full head of bright red hair. It always stood up in the sea of shaven-headed Thayans. Pyras's hair was strangely resistant to any attempts of removing it, be it in mundane ways or via magic.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Pyras Autorian thought himself to be fair-minded, but most Red Wizards that knew him called him weak-willed. Pyras often hid his failures and weaknesses.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Pyras had little magical talent, to the constant embarrassment of his father. To please the senior Autorian, Pyras entered the world of politics.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Pyras had no real talent and was an open puppet of Szass Tam . In turn, Szass kept Pyras safe with bodyguards, magical items , and spells .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Pyras was tharchion of Thaymount by 1372 DR .</p>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Pyras Autorian was possessed by Eltab in the plot of Naglatha against Tam but was likely killed by Thazienne Uskevren when she defeated Eltab.</p>
<p>Although soon healed or resurrected by some means, he was later sacrificed by his patron Tam in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , in order to invoke Bane for help in the Thayan civil war .</p>
