<p>The Fishstink was the poorest and most dangerous ward in Tarmalune , named for how it smelled. It was located to the east of the city.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The inhabitants of the Fishstink were the poor, outcasts, criminals, fugitives and the infirm or maimed, as well as escaped slaves of other cities in Laerakond , who arrived in the city without enough money to live in the other wards. Members of the monstrous races, such as orcs and minotaurs , also lived in the Fishstink.</p>
<p>The authorities of Tarmalune allowed the inhabitants of the Fishstink to hunt seagulls for food, as a way to reduce the criminal activity in this ward.</p>
