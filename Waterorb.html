<p>Waterorb was a type of fungus that grew in the Underdark in shallow water. When mature, it was bulbous in shape and bigger than a human head. If squeezed and wrung out, it yielded about a gallon (almost four liters) of potable water. The remaining husk was bland and chewy like a sponge , but edible, providing about 1 lb (0.45 kg) of food.</p>
