<p>Anchoril was a town on the island of Suj , located on its eastern shores, washed with the waters of the Trackless Sea . The closest major settlement to Anchoril was Sujjar , west of Anchoril, built on the Suj-lan bay.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>Anchoril was connected to the Lantanna Embassy in Waterdeep via a keyed portal called The Welcome Gates . This two-way portal led to the Visitors' Vale just outside of Anchoril. The portal was protected by the key-word "Enjoy" and by Lantanna guards who deterred undesirables via dreaded bureaucracy.</p>
