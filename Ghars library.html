<p>The library in the town of Ghars , Cormyr , in the mid–14 th century DR was run by librarian Phelos Marmwitz .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The library was small, little more than a large room added onto the town hall at some point. It had small windows, making it dim. It was also dusty and smelly, due to mildew arising from the damp outer wall and threatening the books. Marmwitz insisted on silence and not disturbing other patrons, if there were any.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The collection was dull and largely half a century old. The works were mostly non-fiction, on such topics as philosophy , natural science and natural history like The Internal Structure of the Brachiopod , and other dry subjects, but especially history—fully half the books were shared from history-buff Marmwitz's personal collection. This included local history and folklore of Cormyr. There was a small assortment of fiction, but only what Marmwitz considered "serious literature" (and certainly not pulp fiction like Camber Fosrick tales). There were also drawers of old maps of Cormyr and surrounding lands, many detailed but out of date.</p>
<p>Anyone could come to the library to read and research, but only permanent residents of Ghars were allowed to borrow books for a period of a couple of tendays or so, provided they returned them on time. Perhaps unsurprisingly for its stock, the library was little-frequented, often not seeing a patron for days while it could be years between borrowings for individual books.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mrs. Barnabas Hinkel borrowed a book on local history from the library in the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR . Seven years later, that book had yet to be borrowed again. Similar books had been waiting even longer.</p>
<p>The traveling king's envoy Grodoveth started visiting the library in Tarsakh of the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , researching the Vast Swamp and the legends of the bandit chieftain Fastred .</p>
<p>On Eleint 17 , Jasper went to the library to return The Internal Structure of the Brachiopod on behalf of Benelaius and questioned Grodoveth and Marmwitz about recent research, as part of his investigation into Dovo 's murder. Marmwitz was irritated at Jasper for disturbing Grodoveth in his research. He returned the next day for follow-up questions.</p>
