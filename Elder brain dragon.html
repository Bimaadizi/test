<p>An elder brain dragon was an aberration that was formed when an illithid elder brain took over the body of a living dragon .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Elder brain dragons did not require sleep or food for sustenance. Their bodies were imbued with psionic power.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>One significant advantage elder brain dragons held over other elder brains was their mobility. They were not constrained by the physiological limitations of having to remain within a brine pool, protected by their mind flayer servants and thralls.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>These monstrosities attacked their foes as other dragons did, raking foes with their claws or tearing them to shreds with their strong jaws. They also however possessed powerful tentacles that could hold down creatures as large as frost giants . Using their psionic powers, they could shatter the concentration of any creature they held, nullifying any spells or abilities that may have been concentrating upon.</p>
<p>They could not be frightened or charmed by magical means and were immune any form of psychic assaults.</p>
<h3>Breath Weapon</h3>
<p>Elder brain dragons possessed a unique and horrifying breath weapon. Just as other dragons could breath bursts of flame or jets of acid, elder brain dragons exhaled streams of brine filled with illithid tadpoles that easily transformed victims into new mind flayers in short time.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Due to their mobility, elder brain dragons often served as generals to mind flayer armies.</p>
<p>If an elder brain dragon was slain, it was possible to set free the spirit of the dragon whose body was taken over. These spirits were capable of brief empathetic connection before departing for the afterlife .</p>
