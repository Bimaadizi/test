<p>The stone spindle was an artifact that originated from the long-lost giant civilization of Ostoria .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The stone spindle itself comprised gray stone that stood 10‑foot-tall (3‑meter). It bore upon its surface strange, unidentified symbols.</p>
<p>It was entirely impervious to physical and magical harm.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>While its exact powers were unknown, the relic was capable of "wreaking havoc" upon the Weave itself. It was capable of at least dispelling the magic of mythallar s, which were considered among the most powerful magical devices in the Realms.</p>
<p>If a spell of sufficient power were centered upon the spindle, a blast of anti-magic would release from the relic and extend outward for 3 mi (4.8 km). That area would become a dead-magic zone for a single day and all spellcasters within would be unable to cast any prepared spells. Magical constructs, creatures crafted by magical means and living spells were not affected by this blast.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Spindle was said to have been crafted some time before the Days of Thunder , some 40,000 years before the events of the Second Sundering . At some point in history, it fell into the depths of the Sea of Moving Ice in the Frozenfar .</p>
<p>The spindle was uncovered in the Year of Chilled Marrow, −343 DR , by arcanists of Netheril and took it aboard the enclave of Ythryn . The arcanists began to conduct experiments upon the strange giant relic to learn more. Unfortunately, one of the experiments went awry and an anti-magic discharge from the spindle cause the enclave's mythallar to malfunction. The flying city plummeted out of the sky and crashed into the icy wastes below. For years, it continued to emit magical radiation that disallowed any spellcasting within a certain radius.</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , the spindle remained within the Spire of Iriolarthas within the ruins of Ythryn. It was believed to have been dormant as of that time.</p>
