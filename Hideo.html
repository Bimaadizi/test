<h2>History</h2>
<p>Long before the Year of the Behir, 1342 DR , framers of the Kyo prefecture were menaced by marauding pirates; in order to defend themselves, the farmer folk took up kama, lacking actual weapons. Hideo was the creator of these kama that ensured the farmers' survival. Despite being the architect of the farmers' survival, eventually, Hideo fell out of favor and died in poverty, spending a fortune on Hideo's kama and arming the locals.</p>
