<p>Discord was a bastard sword rumored to have been enchanted with the aid of planar beings.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This exotic sword had a line of black crystals embedded along the blade.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Like other weapons created by Ortus , Discord started resonating with unnatural frequency upon hitting its target. The sound creating by this was virtually imperceptible by mortal ears, though they suffered its effects regardless—it dealt sonic damage and had a good chance of causing confusion . Additionally, this bastard sword possessed a +2 enchantment.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Discord's creator was known as Ortus of Gond , the Mad Tinker. It was a mystery where the uncanny black crystals came from; some believed they were of planar origins, as Ortus was known to have offered his crafting services to beings from beyond the Prime Material plane .</p>
<p>Circa 1374 DR , Discord was in possession of one of the Cult of the Dragon lackeys who served under Kaela Ulsant in Thentia , Moonsea .</p>
