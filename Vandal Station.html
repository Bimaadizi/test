<p>Vandal Station was a Rengarth town during the time of ancient Netheril .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The settlement was built on the coast of the Narrow Sea , between Bandor and Northreach .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Vandal Station traded heavily with nearby Bandor Village, buying the silver and gold mined there.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Vandal Station was founded in 723 NY (−3136 DR) by the Vandals tribe of Rengarths, who fiercely protected the area as far away as the Cold Forest . During the following Silver Age , the Netherese took up aggressive mining expeditions in the Barren Mountains , coming into conflict with the Vandals as they passed. This came to a head in 1412 NY (−2447 DR) when the Vandals killed an entire group of miners and their guards who had been digging up their sacred burial grounds in search for gold and silver.</p>
<p>A plague from Bandor Village struck in 2328 NY (−1531 DR) , sweeping through the population and reducing it from 4500 to fewer than 500 souls. Unable to protect their ancestral lands, most of the survivors moved to distant Frostypaw , while the few who remained patrolled the land in small groups in an attempt to protect their most important sites.</p>
<p>Vandal Station ceased even being a village in 2784 NY (−1075 DR) , with just a few scattered holdouts residing in the area. The ruins of the city became covered in a sheet of lethally cold ice, and in the spring of 3353 NY (−506 DR) wolves descended upon the site and took the last Vandal bodies, fully removing Vandal Station from history.</p>
