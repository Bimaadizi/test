<p>A clockwork amulet was a magical amulet that removed all variability due to chance from a single action.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The copper amulet contained small internal gears that constantly emitted a very faint sound of clicking and whirring.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The clockwork amulet drew its magic from the Outer Plane of Mechanus . Once per day, its wearer could use the amulet and invoke exact predictability from a single attack. The amulet ensured that the outcome of the attack was perfectly average, given the wearer's abilities. The amulet then regained its magic at the next dawn.</p>
