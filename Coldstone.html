<p>Coldstone was a type of mineral, imbued with frost and magical cold.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Coldstones resembled small blue crystals. When used for crafting, they were broken into 0.3 pounds (0.14 kilograms) pieces.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When a coldstone was broken or crushed, it produced numbing cold. Because of that, coldstones were often used to produce traps that dealt magical cold damage when activated. Weak traps required only one crystal, medium-powered traps - three crystals, powerful traps - five, and lastly, seven coldstones in a trap could trigger to produce a deadly wave of frost that was likely to kill the unwitting creature.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR , coldstones were fairly common across the many civilized settlements across the Sword Coast , the Moonsea , and the rest of Faerûn , especially in the towns with thieves' guilds. Places like Luskan , Neverwinter , Daggerford , and even the hamlet of Gillian's Hill had coldstones in raw in within pre-made traps available for purchase.</p>
