<p>Griffonheight Keep was a keep and barracks in Velprintalar , Aglarond , situated on a hill.</p>
<p>As of 1368 DR , it housed 250 foot soldiers and 50 cavalry, under the command of Sir Tyman . By 1374 DR , the number of foot soldiers had increased to 400, and the cavalry had been replaced by aerial cavalry.</p>
<p>Although it was believed at the time that a Thayan threat had triggered the buildup of troops, the Simbul had detected a threat between the Society of the Verdant Arrow and the Sons of Hoar and wished to be prepared.</p>
