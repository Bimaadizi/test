<p>The Moon's Hand was a certain kind of mace preferred by the members of the church of Sel√ªne .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A Moon's Hand had a smooth head representing the moon in a specific phase. Each temple had its own preferred phase for their Moon's Hands.</p>
<p>It was otherwise identical to a typical footman's mace , light mace , or heavy mace , with the clergy favoring the heavy mace.</p>
<h2>Users</h2>
<p>In the hands of a silverstar , a Moon's Hand, even a non-magical one, was more accurate and more damaging, and could inflict injuries even on creatures that could only be hurt by enchanted weapons. A silverstar could even treat any heavy mace they wielded as a Moon's Hand, transforming it into an enchanted weapon with shock and later shocking burst powers.</p>
