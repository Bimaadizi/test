<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1491 DR , Vester and three other soldiers went missing while on a routine patrol along the Mere of Dead Men. They encountered lizardfolk tribe and mistook their presence for an attack. The lizardfolk, led by Hissain , fought back and captured the four Leilon troops. They used the captives as bait to lure away a group of rot trolls that had previously driven the lizardfolk away.</p>
<p>When Vester still didn't return after already being two days late, his friend Breltora Red-Eye began to worry. However, Vester's commander, Sergeant Hazz Yorrum , did nothing to investigate the disappearance of the soldiers, so Breltora contacted a group of adventurers . When pressed by Breltora and the adventurers, Yorrum showed them the patrol route on a map. The adventurers then rescued Vester and the other three soldiers.</p>
