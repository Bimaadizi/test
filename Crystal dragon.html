<p>Crystal dragons were a breed of gem dragon known to be the friendliest of their kind and to enjoy conversing with other creatures. They were named for the similarity to crystal.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Crystal dragons had a milky-white coloration; their scales were glossy white as a hatchling and became translucent as they aged. Moreover, their scales reflected the light that fell on them. Under the light of a moon or stars, they luminesced and sparkled, and in bright sunlight they had a dazzling brilliance.</p>
<p>A hatchling had a 1‑foot-long (0.3‑meter) body and 1‑foot-long (0.3‑meter) tail, while an adult had a body length of 28​ to ​38 feet (8.5​ to ​12 meters) and a tail length of 30​ to ​40 feet (9.1​ to ​12 meters). The biggest great wyrms grew to 92 feet (28 meters) long in the body, with tails 91 feet (28 meters) long.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>They were the most amiable of the gem dragons. Although crystal dragons rarely went looking for companionship, they eagerly welcomed visitors to converse with, especially if they were interesting or appeared friendly and not trying to rob them. Otherwise, they tried to avoid meeting them. Crystal dragons were non-aggressive and would rarely start a fight without a good reason. They would much rather talk things out. In fact, they would even use charm person near the start of any conversation to avoid any risk of battle later.</p>
<p>Crystal dragons had an endless curiosity about the world, which they tried to satisfy by talking with people about it. A favorite pastime was to emerge at night, lie on the ground, and watch the stars.</p>
<p>They also loved having fun and making mischief, often in the snow. Crystal dragons would hurl snowballs at unsuspecting targets, fashion splendid sculptures from snow and ice, and construct snow forts and even amazing palaces on mountaintops.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The breath weapon of a crystal dragon was a cloud of glowing shards, forming a cone of light up to 50​ to ​60 feet (15​ to ​18 meters) in length for an adult. The shards struck and harmed all those caught in the blast, but the real danger was the dazzling and brilliant white light they emitted, which blinded opponents caught within for for up to an hour in early cases, a matter of minutes, or up to two dozen seconds in later cases. Even creatures outside the blast, up to 60 feet (18 meters) away, could be dazzled by the glare, hampering their vision, especially if they were nocturnal or subterranean dwellers. The crystal dragon's breath was as bright as daylight and could be observed for miles around.</p>
<p>Crystal dragons were naturally immune to light-based spells and similar attacks and to natural cold or to all cold and cold-based spells .</p>
<p>Like any dragon, and in addition to the common powers of gem dragons, crystal dragons gained an array of magical powers as they aged, though accounts of these varied. In one version, they could charm person from hatching as often as they needed, juveniles could create a color spray thrice a day, and mature adults could make a suggestion thrice a day. Very old crystal dragons gained a power called luckscale —once a day, they could enchant one of their own scales as if it was a stone of good luck for 9 to 12 hours according to its age. Finally, a wyrm could control winds thrice a day. Alternatively, adults could charm person thrice a day, old dragons could create a color spray thrice a day, ancient dragons could dominate another's mind once a day, and great wyrms could control winds once a day, though psionic crystal dragons could control air instead.</p>
<p>Similarly, crystal dragons could acquire and cast new spells of their own, whether arcane or divine, but they were most noted for their talent in psionics . Those who were so gifted learned the psionic attacks ego whip , or id insinuation and the psionic defenses mind blank or thought shield . For general powers, they favored the disciplines of clairsentience or telepathy Common clairsentience powers for crystal dragons were clairaudience , clairvoyance , and precognition .</p>
<p>They were skilled in acquiring information, swimming, and leaping.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Although they were a little irresponsible with their young, crystal dragons were fairly good parents. Families raised clutches of two to five offspring, and they were likely to be encountered alone or in such clans.</p>
<p>They favored a diet of gemstones and metal ores over any other foods, but could subsist on elemental matter such as air .</p>
<p>Crystal dragons spoke Draconic and both their own language and a language shared among all gem dragons. Moreover, almost one in ten hatchlings could communicate with any sentient being, and the others gained this power as they aged, with one in four possessing it by the time they were mature adults and nearly two-thirds when great wyrms.</p>
<p>Like the rest of the gem dragons, crystal dragons were rarer in the Realms than the common chromatic and metallic dragons .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>There were on occasion conflicts between crystal dragons and white dragons . Some white dragons would hunt down crystal dragons and a few crystal dragons would adopt young white dragons or even steal their eggs. This was apparently in an effort to raise them to be friendlier dragons, though if successful, such dragons were incredibly rare. When they fought, the white dragon was typically seen as the aggressor.</p>
<p>However, despite their general friendliness, crystal dragons carried a strong animosity toward giants of all kinds. Giants would sometimes attempt to enslave crystal dragons and even allied with white dragons to discover crystal dragon lairs and capture their young.</p>
<p>Crystal dragons acted as servants of the deities Aerdrie Faenya , Brandobaris , Erevan Ilesere , Gond , and Vergadain .</p>
<h3>Lairs</h3>
<p>Crystal dragons who dwelt on the Material Plane preferred to live atop cold high mountains, usually on the very peaks and crags. They favored cold open spaces with clear skies for their stargazing but this did keep them well apart from other beings.</p>
<p>In fact, a good number of crystal dragons resided on the Elemental Plane of Air , the most open-skies place of all.</p>
<h3>Lands</h3>
<p>Crystal dragons were known to live on the High Ice , north of Anauroch . However, so too did their white dragon rivals, and they regularly clashed when they came across one another. The crystal dragons had also wiped out frost giants that had tried to settle in the area.</p>
<p>The northern Thunder Peaks , east of Cormyr were cool enough to support but one gem dragon, who was a crystal dragon in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<p>In the Unapproachable East , crystal dragons could be found in the hills and mountains of Rashemen .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>If attacked by visitors, a crystal dragon would try to retreat as quickly as it could—not to run away but to observe its foes using its powers and plan its response. Otherwise, it had no qualms about fighting back. It opened battle with its breath weapon, to disorient and weaken attackers, before it flew into the air where it could use its magic and psionics and anything it had for attacking from range. Biting and clawing enemies were a crystal dragon's last resort.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>When enjoying the company of especially friendly visitors, a very old or older crystal dragon might gift them with one of its luckscales , though its enchantment only lasted a matter of hours.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Once, a band of frost giants from the farthest north of Faerûn migrated south to settle in the High Ice, and there encountered several crystal dragons. In their arrogance or rashness, the giants tried to enslave the dragons, only to be utterly destroyed by them. Thereafter, no giant of any kind would step foot on the High Ice. The hill giants of the Plain of Standing Stones related this warning tale by the mid-1360s DR .</p>
<p>During the Dracorage of 1373 DR , crystals and other gem dragons used their power to shift between planes to escape Toril entirely. They waited out the rage and afterward returned one by one to resume where they left off, but many encountered difficulties.</p>
