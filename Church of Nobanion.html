<p>The Church of Nobanion was a collection of firemanes , clerics , crusaders , and shamans devoted to Nobanion , the King of Lions .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The followers of Nobanion were collectively referred to as the Pride of Nobanion. The firemanes, or specialty priests, were also called Lights of the Lions Mane. Nobanion's crusaders and clerics were both known as Roaring Avengers. The shamans were known as Speakers of the Paw and Roar. Lammasu and greater lammasu were referred to as Elders and Revered Elders respectively.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Nobanion's shamans among the wemic tribes were venerated individuals, second only to the chieftain. Nobanion's faithful often served as constables and judges in their communities elsewhere.</p>
<h2>Celebrations</h2>
<p>Major festivals and celebrations of Nobanion included:</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>Devoted followers of Nobanion were scattered throughout the Vilhon Reach , Dragon Coast , and Shining Plains . The Gulthmere Forest was where Nobanion was most venerated. Major temples dedicated to the Lion King were the Machran Spire in the Gulthmere Forest and the Pride of Nobanion in Nathlekh . Aside from these major temples, Nobanion was worshiped at small shrines that were often difficult to locate for those outside of his clergy either because of the location deep within the wilds, or because they were moved around by nomads. Favored locations for these shrines included granite outcroppings or beneath solitary trees on the open plains.</p>
<h2>Dogma</h2>
<p>Nobanion's faithful only hunted when they were hungry and did not gorge themselves without need. They were not wasteful with their kills. They believed all life was linked by a great circle. Only the strong survived, but through leadership and not tyranny. The weak were to be protected, not bullied. Teamwork and putting an individual's strengths where they were best suited was the key to building an enduring community. Nobanion encouraged a diverse collection of species to flock to his banner to better interpret and spread the word of his teachings.</p>
<p>Wemic followers of Nobanion often had a harsher interpretation of Nobanion's teachings because of their racial tendencies.</p>
<h2>Orders</h2>
<p>A military order called the Legion of Lions was composed entirely of wemic firemanes, clerics and crusaders of Nobanion. Though small in number, this elite fighting force was the bane of Malar 's followers throughout the Realms.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the Church of Nobanion started gaining popularity outside the Gulthmere Forest of the Vilhon Reach. Druids worshiping the Lion God could be seen in the city of Westgate , spreading the word of their deity.</p>
