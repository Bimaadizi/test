<p>Ak'hafta was a drow soldier hunting Drizzt Do'Urden in Mithral Hall for Vierna Do'Urden .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1357 DR , Artemis Entreri disguised himself as Regis and infiltrated Mithral Hall for Jarlaxle and his Bregan D'aerthe . The mercenary was working for Vierna Do'Urden, who wanted to sacrifice her brother to Lloth .</p>
<h3>Death</h3>
<p>The dark elf used his levitation powers to descend a chute used by Drizzt to escape from his villainous sister. Thinking he had sneaked upon the ranger lying on the ground, Ak'hafta used his club to strike at the prone drow, but the soldier only hit an empty cloak. Drizzt, breaking his vow of not kill another of his kind a second time, slammed his scimitar , Twinkle , into Ak'hafta's exposed back. Later, Drizzt used a similar trick with Ak'hafta's body to confuse Artemis into thinking the drow's body was that of Drizzt, but it failed.</p>
<h3>Legacy of Ak'hafta</h3>
<p>After his death, Drizzt shot Artemis Entreri with Ak'hafta's hand crossbow while clinging to a cliff in Mithral Hall, after Artemis revealed he had a cloak of the bat which saved him from falling to his death. The powerful drow poison caused Entreri to fly into a mountain face after he lost control of his magical cloak.</p>
