<p>Galadorna , also styled The Unicorn Kingdom , was a kingdom in the Wizards' Reach until the mid–8 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Galadorna was in the Wizards' Reach , centered around Nethrar ; it did not extend all the way to Laothkund .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>A king reigned in Galadorna. There were a number of barons under him; among those barons were Tholone , Hothal , Maethor , Feldrin , and Belundrar . Lesser lords existed, such as Limmator .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Galadorna had mines of iron and silver .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Each baron of Galadorna had significant retinues and all of them contributed to the kingdom's defense.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the reign of King Baerimgrim , the self-styled Lord Tholone , one of the barons, had been ignoring court decrees since approximately 755 DR .</p>
<p>One bright summer day in the Year of Mistmaidens, 764 DR , about a year after the king was gravely injured by the green dragon Arlavaunta , King Baeringrim held a meeting with his barons to determine the successor; they chose Tholone to be the next king. However, both men were slain by Nadrathen , a Chosen of Mystra , who crowned himself king in their place. After his fellow Chosen, Elminster , stopped him, the Banite sorceress Dasumia slew Nadrathen and took over as Queen of Galadorna.</p>
<p>Under her reign, Galadorna became rife with feuding mages and was chaotic yet wealthy.</p>
<p>The Unicorn Kingdom was ultimately destroyed by the Lords of Laothkund, within a tenday of the Queen's disappearance, very likely within the year.</p>
