<p>Sarltan was the name used by a drow during his infiltration of Scornubel in 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When disguised by magic, Sarltan resembled a fat, unlovely man.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Sarltan was a businesslike, very decisive man, who was willing to trade, but turned to killing at the first sign of treachery.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Sarltan was busy around the clock, even at night, acting the part of a trader, which involved a fair amount of genuine trading.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>All the other drow impersonating locals in Scornubel preferred to defer trading offers related to Underdark valuables to Sarltan. There was also a guard snake in his lair.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR , Dove Falconhand investigated Scornubel looking for signs of drow replacing citizens with cloaking magicks; she took the disguise of a noble drow woman named Iylinvyx, and began peddling glowcap mushrooms and deep wines openly throughout the night. At Cata's Pump , she was oriented by the barkeep to speak to Sarltan; without anyone telling her where Sarltan was, she tried instead asking at Chasper's Trading Tower , where she was told to ask Daeraude in Blackmanacles by another drow impersonator, who identified herself as Yamaerthe . After Daeraude, she was told to seek a corner lantern and candle seller, a lock storage keeper, and a highly discreet hiresword sub-contractor. She was then led to Delsart's Drive , and then to Pelmuth's Draw ; shortly after, she found the door, and after leaving all her steel weaponry there with a guard, she was finally allowed to see him.</p>
<p>He spoke with her briefly; while ascertaining her intentions, Sarltan asked what her true shape was. When Dove claimed she was a drow, he immediately made a gesture that brought two crossbowmen to shoot at her. During the ensuing fight, Dove slew many of his men, and nailed his hands to the desk at which he was sitting with a dagger; however, when combat finished, she noticed the man's throat had been cut during the commotion, and his thigh was transfixed with a dead-magic-bladed knife that made it impossible for her to interrogate his dead body. She resolved to cut her losses and flee.</p>
