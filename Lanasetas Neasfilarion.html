<p>Lanasetas Neasfilarion was a half-elven bard and adventurer who once was a minstrel for House Floshin , but would join Vexter , Master of Illusion, in his adventures once he was fed up with the Floshin family antics.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He wielded an enchanted +3 quarterstaff , and wore two rings ; one of feather falling and one of human influence .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>In his time serving House Floshin he would often use his ring of human influence to lift the mood of the family patriarch, as Lord Elorfindar Floshin had become cantankerous in his old age. In time Lanasetas tired of that life and when the oppotunity arose, he joined up with Vexter to walk the planes .</p>
