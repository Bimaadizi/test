<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>To Amaranthae Auglamyr in 241 DR , should Symrustar Auglamyr tell him about Elandorr's attempts at wooing her, Kuskyn would be so distraught by his son wooing anyone, let alone someone of as low status as House Auglamyr , that he'd cage Elandorr Waelvor immediately and for a long time. She also spoke of him using a spell-cage, suggesting he was known to be a wizard.</p>
