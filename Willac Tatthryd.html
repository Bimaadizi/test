<h2>History</h2>
<p>Willac Tatthryd was born a human boy to a poor single farmer father in the city of Hillsfar, in the Moonsea region of Faerûn . Early in life, Willac found religion and realized disdain for a commoner's existence, becoming an adventuring priest when coming of age. At the age of twenty-one, Willac was mauled to death by a bear on the way to the kingdom of Cormyr . The dead priest's temple returned the adventurer to live via the reincarnation spell – the result was unexpected. Willac Tatthryd returned as an ogress. Learning to use the natural benefits of her new body, Willac learned the crude art of being a fighter, and subsequently, she got used to the bulky size, monstrous strength, and her female body, sex, and gender. However, her human peers found being around an ogre to be unnerving, and Willac returned to regular traveling and adventuring when she felt out of place at the temple.</p>
<p>Willac found many adventuring troupes to join, offering her muscles and healing magic. One notable adventure was when her band came across a gang of ogres. The entire group of adventurers was captured, including Willac, and was taken to the ogres' lair to be the main course for dinner. When the ogres' chieftain laid an eye on Willac, he immediately fell in love with the brutish beauty. The ogress managed to get the chieftain drunk by using her feminine woes, and the group fled captivity. Willac got away with the chieftain's plate mail of etherealness .</p>
<p>By the age of twenty-three, she married a fellow adventurer – the human mage Bregubrod Dryctcyni . The wizard courted the ogress for several months until proclaiming his undying love. Willac was not used to a man's affections and this much attention. But despite it all, she developed feelings for the little man, and the two tied the knot.</p>
