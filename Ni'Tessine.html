<p>Ni'Tessine was a noble sun elven house of Cormanthyr .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The family's ruling line used heraldry colored in pegasus -related colors such as powder-white and sky-blue. Lesser lines used griffon -related colors such as dun-brown and gold.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the destruction of Myth Drannor in the 8 th century DR , many members of the Ni'Tessine clan emigrated to the city of Selu'Maraar in the sea elven realm of Serôs . Along with other immigrant clans, they were looked down on by the "native" Serôsian elves even though the majority of the city's population originally hailed from other "surface elven" communities.</p>
<p>As of the 14 th century DR , the clan also had a presence in Waterdeep . This branch of the family, led by Fenian Ni'Tessine , were elven supremacists who violently opposed the romance between Princess Amnestria of Evermeet and the human ranger Bran Skorlsun .</p>
