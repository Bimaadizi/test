<p>Hew Hackinstone was a shield dwarf posing as a jungle guide in Port Nyanzaru during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hew was missing his left arm as the result of an encounter with the red dragon Tzindelor .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was a bold and confident guide and combatant, and claimed both that he was unafraid of anything and that he had both visited and perfectly remembered "every" mountain, gorge, trail, and crevice in Chult. He came across as barmy, and indeed, he was secretly obsessed with pursuing revenge against Tzindelor, and was willing to lie and deceive to get others to assist him. He referred to himself as the "former master" of Wyrmheart Mine .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Hew posed as a jungle guide in Port Nyanzaru, but with the goal of gathering adventurers to take his revenge on Tzindelor. He charged the same fee as most guides—5 gold pieces per day with one month paid up front —and owed a fee to the merchant prince Jobal in order to operate legally.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He used his one arm to wield his battleaxe .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to Hew, he and his kin had once been the operators of Wyrmheart Mine in southwestern Chult until the dragon Tzindelor seized it from them in the mid–14 th century DR. About 37 years later, Hew was subsequently part of a five-dwarf expedition that sought to reclaim and reopen the Wyrmheart Mine, but unfortunately, Tzindelor ambushed them at the bottom of the mine shaft and burned alive all of Hew's companions. The dragon allowed Hew to escape so that his failure could haunt him, but not before she took his arm (and some of his sanity).</p>
<p>Three years later, at the same time as the death curse struck Toril , Hew was in Port Nyanzaru making promises that he could lead expeditions anywhere they wanted in Chult, but actually planning to find a party of brave adventurers and lead them only to Wyrmheart Mine.</p>
<p>By the time the death curse had ended, Hew had found his way alone to Shilku Bay (not far from the mines) where he encountered a party of champions from the Sword Coast . After asking them honestly to help him slay the dragon and reclaim the mine, the champions agreed to aid him. They battled through Tzindelor's kobold minions, first seizing the mines' forge and then slaying the dragon.</p>
