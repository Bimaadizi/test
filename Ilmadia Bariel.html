<p>Maiden Ilmadia Bariel was a renegade elf that devoted herself to the Ilmatari priest Revered Brother Poquelin during the late 13 th century DR . She was quite a troubled individual that—despite her cruelty—suffered a tragic end that led to dire consequences across Icewind Dale for decades to follow.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Ilmadia was an arrogant and misanthropic individual. She believed that elves were the greatest race on all of Toril . She vehemently disagreed with the idea that elves cede their place of Faerûn to any of the lesser races. Ilmadia's disdain towards others and her frustration with her own people led her to renounced the elven gods of the Seldarine .</p>
<p>Ilmadia thought very little of Poquelin's other lieutenants, that Marketh 's friends were all boorish idiots and that Malavon Despana had none whatsoever. She held an intense hatred for many people, especially the drow elves of the Underdark .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Maiden Ilmadia donned the unique plate mail Black Swan Armor , and wielded the enchanted Argent Shield and longsword Alamion . She was also kept the blade known as Bhaal's Fire , and wore around her neck a special magical amulet that hid her "true nature" from others.</p>
<p>After visiting the Severed Hand, Ilmadia accosted the spirit of Custhantos and took one of the last remaining copies of Elameth's Compendium from the tower's library.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Maiden Ilmadia oversaw the operations of the fire giants loyal to Poquelin in the lower reaches of Dorn's Deep . Among her other activities, Ilmadia sought to create black unicorns using arcane formulae she recovered from the Red Wizard Saablic Tan . She planned to attract a unicorn from the herd that grazed around the Severed Hand .</p>
<p>Her personal calling was to restore the elven fortress of the Severed Hand, a feat with which she became entirely obsessed.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Ilmadia was true devotee of Ilmater and wholly dedicated to the cause of Poquelin. She was not at all aware that the Revered Brother was actually the devil Belhifet .</p>
<p>While Ilmadia died a maiden, she was somehow impregnated by the devil Belhifet. After Ilmadia's resurrection , she gave birth to twins: the half-elf cambions Isair and Madae . While Ilmadia had no relationship with her children, Madae was posthumously named after her late mother by the woman that would raise the twins.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , Ilmadia began to carry out a plan that would wipe out the drow of Rilauven once and for all. Her fire giant subordinates would dismantle the Great Forge of Dorn's Deep and repurpose its components in the construction of an enormous longboat. They would then propel the longboat down the magma flows near Dorn's Deep and break through the cavern wall near Rilauven, flooding the city with molten rock from above.</p>
<p>Ilmadia's plan would not come to fruition. That same year she was killed alongside her fire giants by a band of adventurers that came to be considered heroes of the Ten Towns .</p>
<p>The following year , Ilmadia was resurrected by Mother Egenia , a true disciple of the god Ilmater. Upon her return to life, Ilmadia became distraught over her failed dreams to rebuild the Severed Hand, and soon received news that was too much to bear: by some means she was with child. Egenia viewed the pregnancy as a blessing of Ilmater but the truth was far more sinister. Ilmadia gave birth to the two babes, one with a fiendish tail and the other with cloven feet, each sired by the devil Belhifet. Overwhelmed by the trauma she endured, Ilmadia threw herself off a cliff and died for the second and final time.</p>
