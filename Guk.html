<h3>Goblin slave</h3>

<h3>Among the Hidden</h3>
<p>After the fall of Maerimydra, Guk fell in with a group called the Hidden, who aimed to overthrow the rule of both Kurgoth Hellspawn and the opportunistic Kiaransaleean followers led by Irae T'sarran . Under their tutelage, her skills as a rogue and at remaining unseen blossomed to the point that she was considered one of the stealthiest among them. Despite not even being a drow, Guk was often selected to be a scout for the group in order to find allies for their cause.</p>
