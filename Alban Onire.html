<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Life</h3>
<p>Alban lived centuries prior to the 14 th century DR , where he was known to be the bane of both dragons and giants. In his years, he performed many great deeds.</p>
<h3>Legacy</h3>
<p>As of the 14 th century DR, the stories of Alban's might and heroism were known to many, including Torm himself, as well as his followers, such as Gwydion the Quick.</p>
<p>When Gwydion journeyed to Thar to fight Thrym , he came upon the rest place of Onire. Torm commanded him to take up Onire's burden and use his sword in battle. As Gwydion did this, the body of the warrior disappeared. However, when Gwydion used the sword, the powers of Titanslayer did not hold, as if they never did. The warrior was slain by Thrym.</p>
<p>Upon being sent back to the Material Plane after death, Gwydion took up Alban's sword once again. Here he used it to attack Dendar the Night Serpent. As such, Alban Onire's blade of legend became the first weapon to ever injure the Night Serpent.</p>
