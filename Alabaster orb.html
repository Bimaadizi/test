<p>The alabaster orb was a powerful artifact and a wondrous wizardly implement called an orb that was recovered from the depths of Undermountain in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This orb was a decorative floating implement made of white mineral, such as gypsum or alabaster . Its exquisite draconic design was unique among orbs because it was once a decorative piece affixed to an ancient king's wall.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>After the alabaster orb was reinforced and enchanted via magic to withstand even the hardest hits, it was given the ability to grant offensive boosts to the wielder. It increased the wielder's attack power, accuracy, and the ability to penetrate enemy armor. Additionally, if the wielder also possessed the alabaster talisman , the two items reinforced each other's magics, further boosting the wielder's power, and temporarily increasing their chance to deal devastating and lucky hits at the beginning of battle. The items' power to grant lucky strikes was reactivated each time the wielder killed a creature.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>History forgot the identity of the ancient king whose grand hall was decorated with elements that would eventually become the alabaster orb and alabaster talisman , but these items were recovered from Undermountain and magically enhanced sometime in or before the late 15 th century DR.</p>
