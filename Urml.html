<p>Urml was a settlement of grippli at the far eastern end of the Wetwoods in the Shining Plains .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Over a number of years, grippli gathered at this location and established the settlement of Urml. They tried to stay out of the affairs of humanoids as much as they could.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Spur, 1348 DR , an excavation outside Urml turned up a magically preserved rieldoxia , a word crystal of the fallen empire of Jhaamdath . It apparently contained the thought images of Exarch Thelasand IV of Jhaamdath, made after the Procession of Justice in the Year of the Striking Lance, –247 DR . It mentioned his escape to the Wetwoods and captivity among grippli.</p>
<h2>Population</h2>
<p>Around 1370 DR , Urml was home to some 200 grippli, making it something of a city by grippli standards, as their villages usually only numbered ten to sixty individuals.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Urml's leader around 1370 DR was the elderly tribe mother Oluusious , aged nearly four hundred years old. She was afraid of humanoid expeditions into the Wetwoods, worrying that human expansion would mean their small village being added to human lands.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>A shrine to Silvanus was found in Urml.</p>
