<p>Leaves of the menga plant were thin, long, and green in color and composed of fine fibers.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>

<h3>Uses</h3>
<p>To access the healing properties of menga leaves, they had to be dried for at least a day before being ground up, dissolved in heated liquid, and ingested. It took about 1 ounce (28 grams) to confer any benefits, which were mild relative to most magical healing. Ingesting more than 5 ounces (140 grams) in a day could render a creature unconscious for up to an hour. Ahealthy menga bush had enough leaves to produce up to 12 ounces (340 grams) of dried leaves.</p>
<p>In addition, the long and fine fibers of the leaves could be woven into menga cloth, which was used for everything from fabric to awnings to ships' sails.</p>
