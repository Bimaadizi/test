<p>Ahzalundelarr was a black dragon living in the Wyrmbones who readily manipulated non- dragons and had extended his lifespan unnaturally without resorting to dracolichdom .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ahzalundelarr was described as a ghostly head and set of limbs, not connected to a central body.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Ahzalundelarr both thoroughly enjoyed, and was professionally devoted to, manipulating non-dragons, particularly humans . He considered the understanding of their aims, and how to manipulate those aims, to be his life's work, and appeared to think of little else.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>By manipulating the Weave , Ahzalundelarr appears to have managed to exist in several planes of existence at the same time, and phase his physical form between them. He absorbed all Weave energy directed at him, including harmful magic, and didn't need to eat, sleep, or even breathe. When absorbing the energy of magic items, he could study them beforehand, in order to learn exactly how they affected the Weave, and once he'd absorbed them, appeared to gain the ability to affect the Weave in the same way as the item could. It's been suggested that he was very talented at scrying , as he had never once fallen into a trap that had been laid for him - that, and he had a very efficient non-magical intelligence network at his disposal.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Ahzalundelarr possessed multiple lairs, and had amassed quite the hoard of treasure. However, he didn't care about it and only seemed to find use for his wealth when he was funding his projects, rewarding his underlings, or providing bribes for his servants to pay to whomever needed bribing. Magic items that came into his possession would be studied intensely before he absorbed them.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Ahzalundelarr worked tirelessly to undermine the ambitions of non-dragons with aspirations to build an empire. As an individual, it was said that nobody else was more effective than he in doing so. He also shared Mystra 's goal of spreading magic among the people, though, rather than doing so for magic's sake, his goal appeared to be putting the tools in the hands of the people to better protect them against orc and goblin hordes as well as more magically-inclined evil creatures, such as beholders , mind flayers , and hags .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Ahzalundelarr was the patron of the largest of Kormul 's " wyrmcults ". They called themselves "the talons of his claws, at work in the world". These cultists believed him to be far older and more deserving of the title 'god' than even ancient deities like Shar . They performed whatever actions he required of them, though they were typically kept in the dark about why he was asking them to do things.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The dragon's goals aligned closely with those of the Chosen of Mystra , and Elminster , at one time, possibly hinted to the Magister that this might be because Ahzalundelarr melded his mind with a powerful servant of Mystra , such as a Chosen.</p>
