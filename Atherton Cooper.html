<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early Life</h3>
<p>Sneakabout stole Godsbane from its previous owner before killing him, but not before the sword's former owner had been driven mad by it.</p>
<h3>Time of Troubles</h3>
<p>During the Time of Troubles in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Sneakabout's village was attacked, looted, and razed by a Zhentilar force. During the battle, Cyric stole Godsbane from Sneakabout, as well as Atherton's pony.</p>
<p>Shortly after, Sneakabout met Midnight, Kelemvor, and Adon when they arrived in the area and halflings of his ruined village robbed them blind. He instead aided them and offered to guide them in their subsequent journeys. However, in truth, Sneakabout was under a curse and driven to recover his sword.</p>
<p>However, when they caught up with Cyric and the Zhentilar in the Bonerun valley of the Sunset Mountains , the maddened Sneakabout attacked Cyric while trying to recover the blade Godsbane , but was slain by Cyric.</p>
<h3>After Death</h3>
<p>After Sneakabout died, his spirit went to the City of Judgment on the Fugue Plane , being considered one of the False for his cursed need for the sword. Midnight met him there and learned his past. Sneakabout helped Midnight find her way around Bone Castle , although he complained constantly that he would be the one to drive Adon into the Wall of the Faithless , and that nothing could be changed now.</p>
<p>After Midnight ascended to godhood, Midnight, now Mystra, sent Yondalla to investigate the case of Atherton Cooper.</p>
