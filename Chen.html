<h2>History</h2>
<p>General Chen attempted to overthrow the Emperor of Shou Lung and seize the throne for himself during the 1330s DR . His coup nearly started a full-scale civil war between the northern and southern regions of Shou Lung.

The Emperor chose to send him to the Valley of Exiles as punishment.</p>
