<p>The owner of Softer Tapestries, Inder Dunseltree was replaced by a drow infiltrator at some point on or before 1369 DR , and sent off to Chult . On that year, the drow infiltrator participated in a mission to get Halonder Eldeglut replaced by another drow. Unknown to him, his partner Anlaervrith Mrantarr had in turn been replaced by a different drow, Qilué Veladorn , one of the Seven Sisters .</p>
<p>During the infiltration, he and his partner (who had in turn been replaced without his knowledge) took care of distracting Halonder and his wife Iyrevven Eldeglut so that their wine could be poisoned. They were successful at this task before the one replacing his partner blew her cover.</p>
