<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , Theldaun was an old man and experienced wizard. He harbored opinions that adventuring life was not a fun and exciting vocation. Instead, it was filled with danger, especially for wizards whose life could be ended with another mage's stray spell. Firehurler put his musings into a book – Teachings of an Angry Old Mage . A copy of the tome was kept in the library-citadel of Candlekeep as of late-14 th century DR.</p>
