<p>Braunstar Wheelwright was a wagon and carriage shop in Ashabenford in the late 1300's DR . It was run by the expert wainwright Elmo Braunstar , a wise and beloved man within Mistledale , who designed, sold and repaired wagons and carriages of all kinds.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The shop offered extremely reasonable prices, so much so that traveling merchants passing through would often purchase a pair of wheels to ensure an even axle in case of a wheel break. As a result the shop was often low on wheels for sale.</p>
<h2>Products</h2>
<p>The shop featured a number of carriages and wagons of Braunstar's design, including the Swanswing covered carriage , which was very popular among nobles, and the Fleetrun long wagon , which were a prideful means of conveyance for the merchants of the Dragon Reach . The latter were so popular they had a three-year-long back order, to the point where they were the target of thieves even when traveling empty.</p>
