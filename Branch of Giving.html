<p>A Branch of Giving was an enchanted unwilting sapling usable by druids and rangers .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Nature's magic was channeled through a Branch of Giving , keeping it green and alive without having to be planted into the earth. A druid or a ranger could will the sapling to grow two flameberries or two iceberries once per day each. To no surprise, flameberries harnessed magical power of fire and iceberries – of cold. These berries could be fed to an animal companion to grant them special abilities temporarily. Berries of ice granted them powers and resistances of winter and berries of flame – powers and resistances of fiery nature.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , some of the Branches of Giving could be found within the endless halls of Undermountain – the mega-dungeon underneath the City of Splendor, Waterdeep .</p>
