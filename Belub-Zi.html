<p>Belub-Zi was an influential merchant and the head of his merchant family in the city of Westgate in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the homeless beggar named Slicker was collecting coin on the Market Triangle of Westgate, when a nearby building exploded into a pyre. Unlike the destroyed building, a stack of crates owned by Belub-Zi, a well-connected merchant who manned his stall on the Triangle, was safe, as only a madman would dare to explode Belub-Zi's goods. Slicker decided to stick close to them as that was, in his opinion, the safest place in the area.</p>
