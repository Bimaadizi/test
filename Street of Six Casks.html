<p>The Street of Six Casks , briefly known as Haring's Way , was a small winding street in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This road ran from northwest to southeast, stretching between Presper Street and Shrimp Alley , formerly known as Shrimp Street.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This street earned its moniker of "Six Casks" due to it having once been fronted by six competing cooper ( barrel -making) businesses. Over time the family lines of two of these businesses died out, while another two were bought out by their rivals. One of the bought out businesses moved elsewhere into the North Ward , while the other shut down completely.</p>
<p>In the 1350's DR , during a brief period in which one could purchase the naming rights to streets from city clerks, a wealthy individual purchased the naming rights to the Street of Six Casks and had it renamed to Haring's Way. When this brief period ended, this street and others like it had their previous names restored.</p>
