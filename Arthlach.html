<h2>History</h2>
<p>Arthlach was a guest at Morlin Castle on Eleint 11 of the Year of the Flaming Forests, 224 DR , where he arrived on the same day as Highlord Falaeve of Siluvanede . They were at each other's throats all day, which got on the nerves of their host, Lord Breiyr .</p>
<p>During dinner, the Axelord sought to discuss the recent fires that had damaged much of Halangorn Forest ; the elflord was actively dismissive of the idea they might've been set by sorcery. However, the dinner was joined soon after by Herald Huntinghorn of Tavaray , who revealed he had reason to believe the blazes were set in fact by sorcerers from Athalantar . As the conversation turned to the Magelords of Athalantar , the Axelord discovered the elven lord trying to cast a spell, and immediately cried out for help, hurling his own leg of lamb into the elf's face. The elf wordlessly tried to cast another spell, and the Axelord hurled an axe, decapitating him in a single throw.</p>
<p>The elf's dead body melted into the form of a human , identified by the castle's Knight of the Gate as Mage Royal Ubriien Orlyn . The herald, in turn, revealed himself to be the sorceress Myrjala Talithyn , who praised the axelord's aim and judgment as she saw herself out. The Axelord said nothing, but smiled at her gleefully while she departed.</p>
