<p>Khalid's Gift , or simply The Gift , was a unique enchanted necklace created by the Harper Khalid as an anniversary present in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Khalid's Gift was a hand-crafted necklace. It was weaved using the finest spider silk and decorated with a large clear aquamarine gemstone .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Gift possessed a variety of enchantments. However, it was unclear if any magic occurred during the amulet's creation. Some believed that no arcane manipulations took place and its magic was naught but the reflection of Khalid's deep love and affection for his wife.</p>
<p>Some of the item's enchantments increased the wearer's natural beauty and charisma, and wisdom. Khalid's Gift also imbued Jaheira with vitality, rejuvenating her and making the half-elven woman glow with youth. While Jaheira wore the necklace she could not get fatigued and was protected from being cursed . Additionally, she could cast the spell aid once per day.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Khalid created the amulet in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , during his and Jaheira's involvement in Caelar Argent 's crusade against the Dragonspear Castle . With aid from their friend, the famed Bhaalspawn Abdel Adrian , Khalid collected the materials for the Gift's creation: spider silk from the Forest of Wyrms and a perfect unblemished aquamarine from the Underdark . He surprised Jaheira on their anniversary with the amulet imbued with rejuvenating and protective magic.</p>
<p>A century after Khalid's death, Jaheira, now the High Harper of Baldur's Gate , considered the necklace to be a worthless trinket but also her most prized possession. She kept it secure underneath her home in the Gate, along with other mementos of her younger and more adventurous days.</p>
