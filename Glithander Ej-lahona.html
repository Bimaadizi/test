<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Eleint of the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , or within less than a month, Glithander Ej-lahona, Rafim Cinder , and Arroc became the three most recent additions to the famed Wizards Guild of Ravens Bluff. Their acceptance into the guild was personally sponsored by the Old Sage, Elminster Aumar himself, who, at the time, visited the guild to address the looming extraplanar threat to Ravens Bluff. All three new members were rumored to have elvish blood and to be originally from Elminster's home, the Dalelands . Glithander Ej-lahona's acceptance into the guild and Elminster's visit were reported in Ravens Bluff Trumpeter by Nadd Parker , a freelance reporter.</p>
