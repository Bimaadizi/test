<p>Kurwin's Cauteriser was a unique enchanted scimitar that once belonged to the infamous mortician Kurwin , who committed his depravities sometime before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Cauteriser possessed a simple enchantment that heated up the blade, burned the targets with each slash, and had a chance of lighting the target aflame. Its slashes could also lacerate the target, leaving them bleeding.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Cauteriser was the weapon wielded by the mortician Kurwin, who used its magic blade to dissect cadavers. Eventually, the mortician found a bit too much pleasure in dissections and switched to other subjects—folk who wouldn't be missed. However, Kurwin's crimes came to an end after he targeted a tavern owner of some repute and the mortician was ratted out to the law. Subsequently, Kurwin's Cauteriser ended up in the paws of the kobold grave-robber Bugthimble , who desecrated the Lower City Graveyard in Baldur's Gate in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR .</p>
