<p>The rod of the twisted Weave was an item with properties similar to a rod of absorption except instead of storing spell energy it released it as a backlash of negative energy .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A rod of the twisted Weave was a long scepter that tapered to a point at one end made of a black-colored material. The other end of the rod was constructed with intricate strands that had been woven loosely together. Nestled amid this basket of strands was a plume of pale green raw magical energy.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Similar to a rod of absorption , the rod of the twisted Weave could absorb incoming spells and spell-like abilities that targeted the wielder or the wielder's possessions. However, unlike a rod of absorption , the rod of the twisted Weave did not store spell energy for later use. Instead it immediately released is as a backlash of negative energy that targeted the original caster of the spell.</p>
<p>Furthermore, certain spells, like negative energy protection , could ward an individual against the negative energy backlash and undead spellcasters were even healed by this effect.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1372 DR , Irae T'sarran made use of this item to great effect during the Silence of Lolth in Maerimydra .</p>
