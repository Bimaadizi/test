<h2>Possessions</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Once Gwydion was the court wizard of duke Pryden Daggerford but at 1370 DR the court magician was Bronwyn Daggerford in all but name. Gwydion was then free to focus on his studies, his ultumate goal being finding a means to achieve immortality, or at least prolonged life. Long ago, he acquired a mysterious book that was reported to detail how achieve Lichdom but it is said that he found the methods outlined there distasteful. Instead, he frequently has sent adventuring parties in search of a good potion of longevity but with no success as of yet.</p>
