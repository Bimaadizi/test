<p>The River Tching was a small river found in northwestern Thindol on the Chultan Peninsula of southwest Faer√ªn .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The River Tching was formed from numerous creeks originating in the Tching Mountains . It flowed south and east to empty into the Thingulph south of Lundeth .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This river lacked the boat traffic and other signs of commerce presents on Thindol's other rivers. As it flowed toward the Thingulph the River Tching fed several stagnant marshes. The mouth of the River Tching was a delta spanning several miles.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Thindol's few remaining tribes of lizardfolk were found along the length of the River Tching. The humans in the area tolerated the lizardfolk as long as they kept their activities near the river banks.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The lizardfolk were actually the eyes of the Sseradess in the region, relaying messages back to the yuan-ti on a regular basis. The lizardfolk also ferried messages and goods on behalf of the yuan-ti to Narubel .</p>
