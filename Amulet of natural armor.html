<h2>Powers</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Many of the amulets of natural armor that were circulating around the Sword Coast in the late 14 th century DR came from Telenn , a retired warrior . When Telenn's old age caught up with him, he pivoted his career towards instructing local youth, aspiring adventurers in the art of combat. During that time, he rekindled his old hobby—the arcane arts. As he improved his magical skills, he started crafting these amulets for the students, to prevent them injuring each-other. Some time later, when he perfected his amulets of natural armor he decided to return to adventuring aided by his amulets.</p>
<p>An older recipe came from the Imaskarran Tome of Ice , which called for quartz and a skeleton 's knuckle, enchanted with mage armor .</p>
