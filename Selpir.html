<p>The Selpir was a slow and quiet creek that forked from the Ardeep River and the South Ardeep River .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>From source to mouth, the Selpir was surrounded by a marshy region known as the Selpir Marsh, which extended all the way to the coast. This region contained several ancient Ardeep tombs, many of which were submerged by the Selpir and breached by its flow, although a few of the tombs remained intact. The breached tombs gave up some of their riches to the creek's flow. Prospectors had been said to find treasures from a lone electrum piece to a magical dagger along the creek bed.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Selpir Marsh was occasionally visited by groups of lizardfolk , but the region was mostly frequented by congregations of merfolk .</p>
