<p>Firzu was a shady merchant who sailed past the town of Reithwin , along the River Chionthar , sometime before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Firzu was a notorious merchant who regularly tried to sail past Reithwin's toll house without paying the toll for the trade goods he transported. The toll house workers confiscated a silver and gold chalice from Firzu's shipment, but soon after, it disappeared from the vault to Gerringothe Thorm 's disdain. Firzu's life ended sometime before the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , when the town was plunged into the darkness and turned into the shadow-cursed lands . His charred body, still wearing an enchanted ring of trading , was stored in the House of Healing 's morgueâ€”likely murdered by the wicked Sharran Thorm family for avoiding the tolls.</p>
