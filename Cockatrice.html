<p>The cockatrice was a small avian magical beast . It was notorious for its petrification ability.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Although about the size of a large turkey or goose and weighing 25 lb (11 kg), a cockatrice more closely resembled a chicken, but it was a hideous hybrid with the wings of a bat and a lizard -like tail. This tail had yellow-green scales, its bat wings were a grey shade, their feet and beak were yellow, and their feathers were of a golden-brown hue.</p>
<p>A male cockatrice had a rooster's wattles and comb, which the females lacked. These wattles and comb, as well as the eyes and tongue of both sexes, were all red.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Cockatrices had an animal level of intelligence.</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>Female cockatrices were very rare, much more so than the males.</p>
<p>These creatures were closely related to the pyrolisk .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Any creature that a cockatrice bit could be permanently turned into stone. Prior to the Time of Troubles , this petrifying aura extended even into the Astral and Ethereal planes , much like that of a basilisk .</p>
<p>Cockatrices were immune to their own petrifying bite and that of other cockatrices, though not of other petrifying creatures and spells.</p>
<p>Cockatrices ferociously attacked any creature that appeared to threaten them or their lairs. Typically, flocks of them would attempt to overwhelm or confuse their opponents, and flew at their faces.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>These creatures could be found almost any region, though they typically inhabited temperate or tropical regions, either underground or above ground in plains.</p>
<p>Beyond the Prime Material plane , scattered numbers of cockatrices could be found in the Elemental Plane of Earth .</p>
<h3>Usages</h3>
<p>Some creatures were known to harvest the venom of cockatrices. Following the Spellplague , this venom typically fetched a price of 100 gold pieces .</p>
