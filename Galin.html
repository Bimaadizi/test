<p>Some time during or before the 1480s DR, Wyrmspeaker Neronvain and his green dragon ally Chuth assaulted Galin's village of Altand in the Misty Forest. Due to the death of an elven priest, Galin ascended as leader of the village. During the assault, Galin witnessed his wife killed before him and crumbled as a leader. He begged for mercy when confronted by Neronvain.</p>
<p>To protect the surviving elves and prevent further destruction of Altand, Galin swore allegiance to Neronvain and his cause.
