<p>The Voidharrow was the sentient will of the interloper deity Tharizdun made manifest, and the very essence of the Abyssal Plague disease .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Voidharrow was able to take any form it wished to, but it was usually encountered as a twisting red liquid crystal with pulsing lines of silver and flecked with gold.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>As a direct creation of Tharizdun, the Voidharrow was a force of chaos with no understanding of human emotions. Its personality was torn between fulfilling the will of its creator and fulfilling its own purposes.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>In addition to being able to spread the Abyssal Plague and control all plague demons , the Voidharrow was able to twist reality itself, and possessed an aura that corrupted physically and mentally anything that was near it. It was also fearless and immune to charm effects.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Voidharrow had a complicated relationship with its creator, Tharizdun, as the Voidharrow's primary goal was spreading its disease, while Tharizdun expected the Voidharrow to free him from his ancient prison.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Voidharrow began as a liquid substance, the remains of the Abyss of a dead universe , that was sealed along with Tharizdun in his prison. Tharizdun infused his will into this substance, giving it sentience. This new creature was called "The Progenitor".</p>
<p>The Progenitor remained trapped with Tharizdun for aeons, until it was released by worshipers of the evil god using a fragment of the Living Gate to create a Vast Gate that was able to breach Tharizdun's prison for a small amount of time, enough for Tharizdun to send The Progenitor out. After being freed from its imprisonment, The Progenitor changed into the Voidharrow, and began spreading its Abyssal Plague across all the multiverse .</p>
<p>The Voidharrow was eventually destroyed by heroes from the world of Nerath , but even after its death its will caused chaos in Toril thanks to the efforts of its heralds Murmur and Scour , who unleashed the Abyssal Plague onto Faer√ªn in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR .</p>
