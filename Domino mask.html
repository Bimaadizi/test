<p>Domino masks were common tools of the trade among the Night Masks of Westgate in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Most domino masks from Westgate were black in color and astonishingly thin pieces of delicate fabric with two oval eye slits. These masks covered the top portion of the wearer's face and held in place with a thin braided cord. They were functional and elegant enough to adorn the face of a wealthy masquerade goer.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>At least one of Westgate's domino masks was imbued with mysterious magics that made even losing it uncomfortable, as if one could feel the sinister secrets held within.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , domino masks were used by most Night Masks of Westgate to identify their ilk, announce the guild's territory, and intimidate those who opposed them. In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , an adventurer found a seemingly cursed domino mask in a dungeon among its treasures. The mask, obviously magical, called to the adventurer, but once it was picked up, the mask refused to be discarded, forcing the adventurer into holding on to the mysterious item whilst plaguing the unlucky dungeon dweller with nightmares of ghostly wraiths and suffering of restless nights. Desperate for answers, the adventurer sought the counsel of a Cormyrean sage who pointed his finger towards the city Westgate and the Night Masks.</p>
