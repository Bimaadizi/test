<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1373 DR , Fris served as a guard for the city. She came to know Keph Thingoleir somewhat well, thanks to his reckless evening carousing leading to him being dragged into a guard post at least once a month to sleep off his intoxication. She would conversationally greet and banter with him as he woke up in the morning before he stumbled off in the dawn light to return home.</p>
