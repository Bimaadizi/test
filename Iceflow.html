<p>The Iceflow was a river that intercepted the Northern Means .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This river spanned from the southwest of the Spine of the World to the Trackless Sea . The Cold Run tundra began at the Iceflow, and ended at Icewind Dale .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Iceflow was an almost freezing river that rushed at very high speeds, making it unnavigable. Flowing from the Spine of the World, the river coursed through a great gorge of ice. In warmer seasons, such as summer, huge ice boulders would break off of the walls of the gorge, plummeting into the Iceflow. The large ice chunks moved through the gorge and floated out to sea.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In, and potentially prior to, the 14 th century DR , a mighty topaz dragon known as Iltharagh made its lair right near the mouth of the Iceflow. The age-old dragon managed to shift the flow of the river with his psionic powers, making it flow through his cavern.</p>
<p>The red wyrm , Klauth , was known to steal and eat dragon eggs and their hatchlings. On many occasions, he was known to have broken into the lair of Narnardinath , a mist dragon , which lay near the mouth of the Iceflow. Klauth became trapped, but collapsed the roof of the lair and escaped. The Neverwintan adventuring company, the Bright Broadaxe , witnessed the collapse of this lair and discovered the mist dragon's corpse and hoard.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>It was heavily rumored that there was a treasure buried around the gorge, as well as tales of ancient ruins. However, all human expeditions were unable to find anything of note, not even rich ores in the walls of the forge.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Many horrific spiders suited to cold climates, such as snow spiders and ice spiders , dwelt near the banks of the river. Remorhaz were found in the area. A few notable dragons also made their home near here.</p>
