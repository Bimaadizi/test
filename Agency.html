<p>The Agency was a mercenary adventuring company active in the early 1360s DR .</p>
<h2>Membership</h2>
<p>The Agency had a very unusual roster of members: three elves , namely a blade bard , a bladesinger , and a wilderness ranger ; a tabaxi ; an aarakocra ; a cat hengeyokai ; a gnome priest with mechanical parts; and a human militant wizard .</p>
<p>They were a former mercenary unit, and many of the members had worked with various mercenary companies, mainly the Mindulgulph Mercenary Company . For their experience with how mercenaries operated, a number of mercenary corps trusted them and hired them for special missions. They were considered to be almost a mercenary company themselves.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before becoming the Agency, the original mercenary unit scuttled the Sea Jewel , a ship of the Wraith of the Inner Sea privateering company, which was on a contract with Turmish at the time. The dromond sunk with all crew lost.</p>
