<p>Iron Keep Bay was a small bay located at Trondhelm on the west coast of Oman's Isle within the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally, the site that would come to be Iron Keep Bay was a piece of coastal land containing the estate of Omar Mc Dauphin and his family, including the castle of Caer Windlauer . Sometime before the mid-14 th century DR , Omar used a ring of three wishes to wish for total isolation so that he and his family would never be robbed or harmed. Among other unintended consequences, the spell caused the entire castle and estate to be thrown into Realmspace . As the large chunk of land rose into the air, ocean water filled the space left behind and created the bay.</p>
<p>As of the midâ€“14 th century DR, the area around Trondhelm was under the control of the Northman kingdom of Oman .</p>
