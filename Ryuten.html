<p>Ryuten was an island located in Kozakura .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ryuten stood as the third among three islands situated in proximity to Kozakura, yet existing beyond its dominion. Positioned to the north of Tenmei , it was easily visible from across the slender Suro Straits that graced Tenmei's northern tip. Ryuten emerged gracefully from the surrounding sea, boasting slender valleys, steep hills, and lofty, forested ridges. The interior was primarily enveloped by the temperate Obitake Forest , contributing to the island's verdant allure. Serving as the central hub for trade and commerce, Shizumi held a pivotal role on the island.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Vast expanses of uncharted territory sprawled across Ryuten, serving as the domain of enigmatic humanoids and supernatural creatures. These inhabitants prefered to dwell within the forested hills, while the human populace of Ryuten inhabited the coastal valleys. The interactions between the two groups was marked by hostile clashes, rendering extensive inland exploration a perilous endeavor.</p>
<p>The people of Ryuten were regarded as barbarians, leading a rugged tribal existence with limited cultural development. They engaged in trade with the korobokuru residing in northern Tenmei, exchanging valuable metals mined from those lands. The exceptional quality of their leatherwork commanded high regard and fetched a considerable price as a sought-after trade commodity.</p>
