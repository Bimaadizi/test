<p>Requiar was a Netherese archwizard who lived during the Golden Age .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 2436 NY (−1423 DR) , the hard-hearted Requiar took over the Netherese enclave of Shadowtop Borough (also known as Aquessir) by force, killing over thirty of its arcanists in the process. The enclave's first archwizard, Trebbe , had died many centuries earlier in 1622 NY (-2237 DR) while working on the Crown of Horns there. Rediscovering the infamous artefact, Requiar equipped the Crown and used it to rule Shadowtop Borough until 2651 NY (−1208 DR) . By this time, the Crown had driven Requiar mad, leading to his overthrow by other arcanists. The Crown of Horns then disappeared, although it would later return to take its revenge on Shadowtop Borough.</p>
