<p>Sharna was a paladin of Helm who was uncommonly strong for her size.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sharna was a petite woman with symmetrical facial features, blue eyes, and long, brown hair.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>She used a pair of gauntlets of ogre power to boost her already considerable strength. Sharna also owned a suit of chain mail , a shield, and a longsword of sharpness .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The dissonance between Sharna's size and strength worked in her favor, and she occasionally used it to shame "tough guys" into worshiping Helm.</p>
<p>Sharna had plans to travel to Maztica to aid in converting the local populace to the Helmite faith.</p>
