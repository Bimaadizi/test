<p>Cormyrean brandy , also known by its imaginative name â€“ Maiden's Kiss , was a highly valued dark brandy produced in the Forest Country of Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>The libation was exported out of Cormyr as early as the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , and available as far as the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale . The Weeping Widow Inn in Targos had several bottles of the brandy available for its guests.</p>
<p>Cormyrean brandy was considered to be a precious commodity outside Cormyr, especially in the Bloodstone Lands . Jarlaxle , the drow leader of Bregan D'aerthe , carried a bottle in his pouch of holding during his stint in the northern regions circa 1368 DR .</p>
<p>Cormyrean brandy was available in the Moonsea region. However, following the death of King Azoun Obarskyr IV and the disaster of the Dracorage , its export price skyrocketed.</p>
