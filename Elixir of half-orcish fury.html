<p>Elixirs of half-orcish fury were potions created through sanguinous magic arts by Araj Oblodra of Crimson Draughts in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Elixirs of half-orcish fury were distilled from the blood of half-orcs , allowing the imbiber to adopt their racial abilities and properties. Once such a potion was consumed, it gifted the imbiber with half-orcish fury – the ability to be relentless in battle and remain standing even after suffering the gravest of injuries. This blood-bound magic was expended after one day.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Araj Oblodra, an alchemist and a Blood Vendor, was using the blood of half-orcs infected with the illithid tadpoles of the Cult of the Absolute to craft these potions during her stay with the cult in Moonrise Towers . After the death of Ketheric Thorm , she returned to the Crimson Draughts – her apothecary in the city of Baldur's Gate , where she resumed her sanguinous magic experiments.</p>
