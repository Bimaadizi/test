<p>Japhoca was a Rashemi grub cook in the caravan which Raidon Kane joined in Winter of 1375Â DR . Hard-bitten and blond-haired, she was clear she did not like him from the start. He assumed it was because he was a Shou , but when she refused a cup of tea from him, she grunted that she did not treat with half-bloods.</p>
<p>When he bid her farewell, she made a rude hand gesture.</p>
