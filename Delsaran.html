<h2>History</h2>
<p>Delsaran's parents were slain and his home woods were destroyed by humans , at some point in or before the early 3 rd century DR .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Black Flame, 229 DR , Delsaran was together with Baerithryn, shaping trees in the High Forest, when he became aware of a fire somewhere in the forest. Their monitoring showed the fire-setter to be a human woman. Baerithryn warned him that the fire was a small one, and not to do anything rash. They then received a sign from Mystra that she was someone earlier foretold; Delsaran agreed he'd keep his distance.</p>
<p>The fire-setter was Elmara, actually Prince Elminster Aumar of Athalantar transformed into a woman. Delsaran later formed part of the forces storming Athalantar under his leadership, and had been introduced to the thief Farl at some point before he caught his wife and fellow thief Tassabra , who had fainted upon seeing of Baerithryn turning into a silver dragon .</p>
