<p>The Midler farmstead was a farm west of the village of Eveningstar in the realm of Cormyr . It was home to the extended Midler family and their cook Maisby in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The farmhouse was a large two-story building with an attic and cellar, some outlying farm buildings, and surrounding fields.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar , the farmstead was overtaken by drow forces led by the priestess Vicala Szind . She captured the entire family and began interrogating them, hoping that they could provide clues leading to the Thread of the Weave that Lolth sought. Unfortunately for Vicala, not only did the Midlers know nothing about it, but Maisby escaped her notice and hid in the farm shed before fleeing to Eveningstar to get help. She was taken care of by the villager Helena Falagon while Vicben Arroway and another Purple Dragon went to secure the farmstead, only to be caught and sacrificed by Vicala Szind. A second team was sent in, this time of adventurers , who had to face not just Vicala's forces, but her ability to ritually sacrifice her prisoners to preserve herself. Though difficult, it was possible that they managed to free the captive Midlers by stealth before openly attacking the priestess.</p>
<p>Whatever the outcome, Maisby went on to work as a servant at Sable Manor , hoping for a calmer employment.</p>
