<p>The Order of Belox , also called House Belox , was an Amnian trading company that operated in Amn's colony at Port Nyanzaru in Chult during the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Order of Belox specialized in the recovery of relics from ancient Serpentes . While some of these artifacts were sent back to Amn as museum pieces, others were stripped of gems and melted down for precious metals to sell.</p>
<p>As an Amnian trading company in Port Nyanzaru, the Order of Belox wielded a great deal of influence in the city and was in constant political and financial competition with the other trade companies. Affiliation with the company granted the right to reside within the safety of Port Nyanzaru's wall.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Agents of the Order of Belox had access to old maps that showed the locations of ancient Serpentes temples as well as good paths between them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the Order of Belox participated in sponsoring a great hunt that served as a competition between Port Nyanzaru's dozens of trading companies. They vied against the other companies—notably Charisk Expeditionary Outfitters , House Selemchant , Naelishti's Naturals , and Zazefay Logging and Mining —to recruit the most capable hunters. The company's maps gave their competitors an edge in navigating the jungle.</p>
<p>Amnian companies like the Order of Belox were subsequently expelled from Port Nyanzaru by the Ytepka Society and a local merchant consortium in the late 15 th century DR, and were replaced by seven merchant princes as the city's mercantile and political leaders. The Order of Belox's trade in jewels and metals was taken over by the prince Zhanthi while their specialization in maps and relics became the purview of Wakanga O'tamu .</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The company's liaison to hired adventurers was a human archeologist who wore spectacles .</p>
