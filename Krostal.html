<p>Malivur and Krostal were assigned to attempt the capture of Shandril Shessair while she was in a caravan from Scornubel to Waterdeep in late 1357 DR. However, before attempting to capture Shandril, they sought to kill Aumlar Chaunthoun when the opportunity presented itself. They were slain by Shandril, almost by accident. They had both been scried on and identified by the Zhentarim scriers Hlael Toraunt and Korthauvar Hammantle , as well as Red Wizards scrying under the command of Hulrivior in Triel .</p>

<p>Krostal told Malivur he recognized another, especially powerful, fellow mage of the Cult of the Dragon in the caravan. The people scrying on them weren't able to identify that mage; it is possible he was lying.</p>
