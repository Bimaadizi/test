<h2>History</h2>
<p>Morris hailed from a rich family who lived in Procampur . He chose an adventuring life early on to satisfy his craving for excitement. As an adventurer , he embarked on several oceanic voyages. But, eventually, Morris grew disillusioned with the profession and all the bloodshed that came with the territory. One day, Morris's ship docked in Ravens Bluff, and that was where he met Milissa of Eldath . The two quickly found common ground and a sense of kinship, bonding over the young priestess's philosophy of peace. He decided to stay in the City of Ravens and joined Milissa as a teacher in her swimming school. Together they hosted swimming courses part-time at Ravens Bluff's docks, hoping to save enough coin to build a Temple to Eldath, not far from the harbors.</p>
<p>Under Milissa's influence, Morris adapted a defensive fighting style that fit his peaceful demeanor.</p>
