<p>Chondath was a country located in the Vilhon Reach . It had a long history. It was located on what once was the psiocracy of Jhaamdath on the shore of the Sea of Fallen Stars . Chondath was later a confederation of city-states under the capital of Arrabar , but used to be a powerful nation in times long past.</p>
<p>All of Chondath was ruled by Eles Wianar , the Lord of Arrabar . He resided in the Generon , a large palace located in the capital.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Chondath was a country with a fabled past, once the site of a mighty empire ruling over much of the Vilhon Reach , Sembia , and arguably Westgate all under the control of the Chondathan Illistine family. It was formed from a confederation of city-states in the Year of the Fear and Flame, 144 DR during a brutal war with the elves of nearby Chondalwood .</p>
<p>Continuing the war with elves, Chondath under the ruler Laviar Illistine sent a force of 10,000 soldiers into the Chondalwood . They are massacred, with scarce 200 soldiers returning alive.</p>
<p>Sometime before the Year of the Blue Shield, 400 DR the cities of Chondathan and Chauncelgaunt were founded by Chondathan colonists in Sembia . Over time these colonies became known as Saerloon and Selgaunt , respectively.</p>
<p>In the Year of Full Cellars, 472 DR the Chondathan city of Mussum was hit by a mysterious plague, which killed more than three quarters of the population in less than a day, and the city was abandoned.</p>
<p>Soon after, Hlondeth regained its independence from Chondath.</p>
<p>Civil war broke out in Chondath in the Year of the Thirsty Sword, 900 DR and, following two years of bitter Rotting War , the city-states of Chondathan, Chancelgaunt, and Sespech were granted independence. Following foul plagues imbued the magic of the lower planes sweeping across the empire, unleashed by the war, the Chondathan empire broke apart.</p>
<p>Circa 1017 DR , exodus of several grand mercenary companies from the Vilhon Reach elected to leave Chondath, being fed up by conflicts, wars, and bloodshed. The mercenaries though Chondath to be honor-less and along with their families, traveling hospitals, mobile sanctuaries, and courts, slowly traveled the continent until they reached the unclaimed lands on the north-western shores of the Akanamere . With time the yellow rolling hills and valleys of scattered ruins were turned into militaristic yet bloodless Blade Kingdoms .</p>
<p>Chondath regained some measure of its former power in the Year of the Scourge, 1150 DR , in part by lending mercenaries to the power struggles in Chessenta</p>
<p>In the Year of the Halflings' Lament, 1386 DR , as part of the Spellplague unleashed the previous year , great swaths of Chondath and western Chessenta were catastrophically exchanged with parts of the world of Abeir , from the land of Shyr . Several Chondathan cities were destroyed, left high on peaks or at the bottoms of ravines. Meanwhile, the draining of the Sea of the Fallen Stars lowered the sea level of Vilhon Reach, exposing new lands and Jhaamdathan ruins. Surviving genasi from Shyr soon formed the kingdom of Akanûl .</p>
