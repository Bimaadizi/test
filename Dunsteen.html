<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the early-to-mid 3 rd century DR , Dunsteen heard a woman tell stories of magic at an inn in Mlembryn . That woman was a priestess of Mystra , whom he attempted to browbeat into silence; she claimed instead that she was on a holy mission from Mystra, and he attacked her afterwards, as she left the inn, hurling fireballs at her. She responded in kind, and after her victory, she cast a spell that compelled him to speak only the truth. Asking him why he attacked her, he confessed to wanting to keep magic as obscure as possible, so less people would work magic and render his skills more valuable.</p>
<p>Before leaving, she asked him who she should ask to learn more about magic. Smirking, he told her that Ilhundyl of Calimshan would give her the best answer of all.</p>
