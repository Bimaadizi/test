<p>The Tesh Bridge connected the main quarters of Zhentil Keep with the Foreign Quarter on the southern shore of the River Tesh during the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The bridge crossed the River Tesh where it merged with the Moonsea , connecting the eastern sections of the Harbor District and Common Quarter with the Foreign Quarter.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Two main gates, the North Tesh Gate and South Tesh Gate , sat at either end of the bridge. Each gate was flanked by a pair of guard towers manned by Zhentilar soldiers.</p>
<p>A series of water gates found beneath the bridge controlled all ship traffic to and from the Moonsea via the River Tesh.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Tesh Bridge was destroyed in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , during the assault on the city by the forces of Cyric during the Fall of Zhentil Keep . The bridge was blown up by orc forces resentful of their treatment by the Zhentilar as they retreated into the Foreign Quarter.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Gondsmen were contracted to rebuild the Tesh Bridge and reconnect the Foreign Quarter with Zhentil Keep. The Gondsmen's efforts were stymied several months later by attacks from the Knights of Myth Drannor .</p>
