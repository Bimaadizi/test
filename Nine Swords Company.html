<p>The Nine Swords Company was an adventuring company that operated in the early days of the Vast , in the 6th century DR , and was reformed in the 1370s DR. It consisted entirely of practitioners of the Sublime Way .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The company was formed by Thallastam of Procampur , after he returned from study in Kara-Tur . They adventured through the Vast, performing good deeds and slaying dangerous monsters.</p>
<p>When they eventually disbanded, Thallastam concealed his companions' nine swords in Swords Pool using a spell he'd cast, to protect and preserve them. His spell at Swords Pool outlived him and his companions, and still preserved their nine swords by 1370 DR .</p>
<p>In the mid-1370s DR, several young blade magicians of the Vast re-founded the Nine Swords Company, using the Inn of the Nine Swords at Swords Pool .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The first Nine Swords Company consisted of ten blade magicians: four crusaders ; five warblades ; and Thallastam himself, a swordsage . The nine each wielded a magic sword , while Thallastam preferred to fight unarmed.</p>
