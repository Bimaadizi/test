<p>Ejen Horo , or the Valley of the God , was a vale located between the Mountains of Copper and the Khopet Dag within the Hordelands .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Blessed with good weather, Ejen Horo was a lush garden-like valley that offered plentiful hunting as many animals were drawn to the bountiful vegetation. Small lakes dotted the landscape, courtesy of the plentiful rainfall experienced in the valley.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sacred to the Tuigan , this large valley was believed to be the birthplace of their great nation. They vigorously defended the entire valley from intruders.</p>
<p>The natives of the Hordelands used this valley to hold their annual couralitai meetings. Honored dead of the Tuigan were also buried within the valley.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Though physically beautiful, Ejen Horo could be a dangerous place since many spirits wandered the land. Usually their wrath was only reserved from those who attempted to rob burial mounds.</p>
<p>A special group of Tuigan priests called the Irooukudel lived within the valley to oversee the care for the deceased.</p>
