<p>The Skullsmashers were a tribe of unusually strong and fierce ogres who made their base in Fangjaws Hold in Thar . They were known to enslave "lesser" neighbors such as goblins and even humans and dwarves , working them hard, usually to death in just a few months.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , the tribe was led by a brutish two-headed ogre named Zar-Umak . It was a matter of speculation among the tribe as to whether he was part ettin or not. Under his leadership, the tribe was notable for having subdued neighboring tribes around Fangjaws Hold.</p>
<p>In the mid-to-late late 15 th century DR, the tribe was led by the ogre Guld . Under his leadership, the tribe joined a coalition of monstrous tribes led by the powerful Blood Skull orcs to raid the nearby human settlements of the Moonsea . The Skullsmashers participated in the destruction of Glister and the subsequent attack on Hulburg , which ended with the coalition being scattered at the Battle of Lendon's Dike . This defeat weakened the Blood Skulls and created a power vacuum among the goblinoid and giantkin tribes of Thar, such as the Skulllsmashers, who began warring with each other for supremacy.</p>
