<p>Zeboaster the Blunt was a sage who hailed from Ordulin in Sembia in the 1350s DR . He was called "the sage on the run".</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Zeboaster had a distinguished and effete nature, notorious for his sarcasm, wit, and overly honest comments. He had a dangerous habit of loudly and publicly declaring his opinions, no matter how badly thought through, and being forced to relocate quickly.</p>
<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>His particular specialty was human history and theology around the Dragonreach .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He perfumed his beard.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Zeboaster argued that stiff-necked chivalry was an anachronistic relic of a simpler and more primitive time and the traditional knight or cavalier was obsolete. He did so in the royal court of King Azoun IV of Cormyr , noted cavalier. Zeboaster soon went back on the road.</p>
<p>Zeboaster once named the god of suffering Ilmater "the Stupid God" and the god of duty Torm "the Foolish".</p>
<p>He called the zulkirs of Thay the "Dumb Wizards of Thay" after they failed to conquer Rashemen .</p>
<p>Zeboaster once attempted a prank in the presence of Vangerdahast of Cormyr by falsifying a mage's sigil, and brought upon himself the Trifold Curse of Mystra . A glowing apparition followed him about for some time, pointing and accusing "Falsely done!" which rather spoiled dinner parties he attended.</p>
<p>Zeboaster nicknamed the Council of Seven Burghers of Harrowdale the "Council of Seven Stones" after its members paid no attention to his suggestions to put a little life in the town.</p>
<p>After the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR , Zeboaster described the transition of the followers of the god of the dead Myrkul to the new Cyric as "merely changing the name on the letterhead and putting a purple sunburst around the skull outside the temples." The Myrkulytes called him "Zeboaster the Still Aliveâ€”For Now".</p>
<p>Zeboaster, perhaps predictably, went missing in late 1358 DR. He had actually gone into hiding.</p>
