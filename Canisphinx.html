<p>Canisphinxes were a variety of vicious, desert-dwelling sphinx .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like most sphinxes, canisphinxes had lion-like bodies about 10 feet (3 meters) long, as well as feathered wings and, most distinctively, a jackal-like head. They weighed about 800 pounds (360 kilograms).</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Canisphinxes had a single magical ability in that they could imbue their roar with magic three times each day. On the first roar, all creatures within 200 feet (61 meters) could be frightened ; the second time, all enemies within 100 feet (30 meters) could be paralyzed, and all within 60 feet (18 meters) deafened as well; and the on the third roar, all creatures within 50 feet (15 meters) were potentially weakened. The effects of the roars of multiple canisphinxes were cumulative, that is, after one roared and then another roared, the second roar would have the second effect. Canisphinxes themselves were immune to their roars.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Canisphinxes did not so much fight as hunt; accordingly, they preferred prey that they could easily defeat, and if their propective prey proved too much effort to kill they would retreat. They attacked with their roars, as well as their powerful claws and fangs. Their hunting tactics typically involved chasing prey across the desert sands for hours to exhaust them before attacking.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Canisphinxes lived in hot deserts. They were normally solitary, but pairs were known to hunt together as a prelude to courting.</p>
