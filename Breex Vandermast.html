<p>Breex Vandermast was an evil half-orc sorcerer living in Hillsfar in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Breex was intelligent but nasty and cruel and was irritatingly over-confident individual who always ready with a cutting insult. His mind was filled with thoughts of money, even knowing that if the First Lord discovered his business he could expect a rather terrible punishment. He was shockingly prejudiced against non-humans, but if anyone criticized his orcish ancestry, Breex flew into a rage.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Breex lived in Hillsfar, carefully disguised as a human . Circa 1486 DR , he approached Captain Haakon Erlich of the Red Plumes with an idea to become rich: kidnap non-human farmers from around the city and sell them to the Hillsfar Arena . Haakon agreed and they captured many people, included the halfling Tinfellow family and the drow Arrizz . At last, Breex and the corrupt Red Plumes tried to capture an adventuring party hired by the Harpers to find the kidnapped people. In the end, the adventuring party managed to escape from the Arena and in the fighting they killed Breex.</p>
