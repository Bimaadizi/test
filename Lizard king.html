<p>A lizard king or lizard queen was a demon -blooded lizardfolk who often ruled tribes of their non-fiendish kin. They served the demon lord Sess'innek .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Resembling ordinary lizardfolk the lizard kings/queens had darker green scales, and distinct demonic features.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>In control of a lizardfolk tribe, they would rule absolute, but in return the tribe would quickly become more advanced than those tribes without any kings/queens.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>They would make use of more complex tactics than ordinary lizardfolk, and would not shy away from battle themselves. However they would always hold a small force of elite warriors nearby and never enter battle alone.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>The lizard kings/queens would always either rule their lizardfolk tribes or they would die trying to get control. around 20% of their children would also be of the king/queen variant, while the rest would just be ordinary lizardfolk, once the kings/queens grew up to adulthood only the strongest were allowed to survive, the rest sacrificed to Sess'innek. While ordinary lizardfolk tribes are not evil as such, those lead by the kings/queens are, as the malevolent nature of their demonic heritage leads them down a dark path.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some sages claimed that the lizard kings/queens are a direct result of the war between the sarrukh and the khaasta . As that war raged Sess'innek sent his demonic forces onto Faerûn , hoping that by controlling the lizardfolk he could weaken the sarrukh on their homefront. After centuries of war he recalled his legions back to his realm of Kearackinin , leaving their offspring to continue the war. It was estimated in 1367 DR that around four in ten lizardfolk tribes was lead by lizard kings/queens. The tribe of lizardfolk living the the Vast Swamp were said to be led by an especially cruel and wicked king , although years later once adventures arrived in the depths of the swamp, no sign of this foul specimen was found and the lizardfolk were no more hostile than other tribes without kingly/queenly leadership.</p>
