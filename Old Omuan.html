<p>Old Omuan was a script developed and used by the people of Omu in Chult .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The script used jagged cuneiform characters that bore little resemblance to any other known alphabet. Even Omu's neighbors and rivals on the Chultan Peninsula could not read it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Old Omuan was used by the people of Omu from ancient times until the destruction of their city in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<p>Formal proclamations were etched in concentric rings onto circular stone tablets, and would need to be written in both Old Omuan and an additional language when Omu's rivals were intended to understand the message, as was the case for a declaration to the Mezroans by the city's last ruler—Queen Napaka —that Omu remained strong.</p>
<p>Inscriptions written in Old Omuan adorned sites like Nangalore , the shrines of the Nine Trickster Gods within Omu, and the Tomb of the Nine Gods .</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, few except trained scholars or sages could decode Old Omuan inscriptions without the help of an already translated text for reference. As such, spells like comprehend languages were otherwise necessary to read it. During the events of the death curse , a scribe in service to the Red Wizards of Thay named Orvex Ocrammas became proficient in translating Old Omuan while exploring the city's ruins.</p>
