<p>Aberration hunters' amulet were uncommon enchanted amulets worn by githyanki hunters.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These magic items were of alien design for the Prime Material plane . They appeared to have a distinct githyanki look – made of shifting and swirling silver with strange stones affixed in the amulets' frames. The amulets reverberated with githyanki magic that protected them or gave them an advantage in dealing with psionic intelligence and mind-affecting magic. The wearers of these amulets also became hard to strike or attack from a distance by all aberrant beings. The wearer could also tap into the ancient githyanki knowledge stored within the amulets. It gave them knowledge of aberrant behavior and combat, giving them a combat advantage whilst attacking.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>One aberration hunters' amulet belonged to the githyanki named Ghustil Stornugoss who settled in Crèche Y'llek on Toril , in the Western Heartlands circa the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR .</p>
