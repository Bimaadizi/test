<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Bow had two floors: a taproom on the first floor, and a meeting room above it. The latter was well suited for private meetings: it had thick tapestries and double walls keeping the noise from being heard outside, as well as a secret ladder in a closet that allowed access to the cellars and from there to the sewers .</p>

<p>Customers at the Bow could get served a varied selection of drinks such as ales , stouts, and sherries . One could also get a light meal there, such as salted fish , sausage , cheese , and buttered bread â€”for 5 gp a platter .</p>
<p>The house special was called a "Liggins," and consisted of all of the menu items cooked together and served on a slab of hot bread with cheese holding everything together. It was named after a former proprietor.</p>
<p>The meeting room could be rented for the sum of 25 gp for an evening, a price which included some drinks for the guests.</p>
