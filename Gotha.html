<p>Gotha was a dracolich who was formerly an ancient red dragon and was transformed by Talos before the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Talos, the god of destruction, had approached Gotha to make a proposal. [ as of when? ] Talos vowed to keep Gotha from death indefinitely, provided Gotha would perform an unnamed task of destruction at some point in the future, at Talos' request. Gotha feared the effects of age and his eventual death more than anything else and subsequently agreed. Talos instructed him to fly to the north of Faerûn to an ice cave in the Icerim Mountains , where an avalanche trapped him for a total of 237 years, keeping him alive and in constant pain and transforming him into a dracolich.</p>
<p>During the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR , Gotha attacked the Moonshae Isles on behalf of his master. There he was defeated by Princess Alicia Kendrick , who was briefly granted the powers of an avatar by the Earthmother .</p>
