<p>The Pendant of Ashaba was a magical pendant that was created by Ashaba , the first lord of Shadowdale , and was used to determine the rightful lord of the dale.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was a silver crescent moon with horns that pointed upwards. Originally the pendant hung from a plain string, but this was replaced by a silver chain that was made by Sylun√© Silverhand .</p>
<h2>Magical powers</h2>
<p>The pendant, upon command, said in the voice of Ashaba: "The bearer of the token be the one and true lord of Shadowdale". It could also detect alignment a little like the know alignment spell, but it could only detect very strongly aligned individuals such as paladins . The limitations of the pendant in this regard were thought to be related to the limitations of its creator, Ashaba.</p>
