<p>Lurianna Sauvage was a werewolf servant who lived in the kennels of Szarr Palace of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lurianna entered Cazador Szarr 's service some time before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , where she met Chamberlain Antwun Dufay , one of Cazador's vampire spawn servants. The werewolf and the vampire spawn became lovers. When, in 1492 DR, Cazador Szarr decided to perform a ritual that would elevate him to being a vampire ascendant , Antwun was ordered to become part of the ritual. However, Dufay knew of what would happen to him in the ritual and made a plan to avoid that grim fate. He purchased a potion from Bonecloak's Apothecary that would knock the imbiber out, giving Dufay the appearance of death and to make sure the illusion was believable, he also purchased lookalike potions of acid poison .</p>
<p>It was unknown if Antwun Dufay consumed the potion and outlived his master. By the time the ritual began, his body was found in the Szarr Palace, showing evidence of acid poisoning, implying he accidentally drank the wrong vial. Lurianna Sauvage, was not informed of the her lover's plan as he was unsure if she could be trusted not to betray him to Cazador. When Lurianna found her beloved's body, she wrote a goodbye note and drank another deadly potion, following Dufay into the afterlife. He body was turned to slush from the inside by the poison.</p>
