<p>Doluwil was a sailor aboard the Vigilant circa 1374 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Before his death, Doluwil was still a young half-elven man. The sailing life bewildered and frustrated Doluwil and the poisoning of one of the crew members left him in fear of eating anything else from the ship's supplies.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Doluwil was one of the most recent members of the Vigilant's crew by the 1374 DR when Captain Lastri Kassireh 's ship sailed from the Sword Coast to the nation of Samarach on the Chultan Peninsula . Onboard the ship were several passengers, including Volothamp Geddarm who traveled to meet with a wealthy yuan-ti merchant, Sa'Sani . The voyage was cursed with bad luck and numerous strange occurrences. Food supplies were mysteriously spoiled; freshwater barrels ruptured; one of the crew, a sailor got drunk and drowned; Volo almost got poisoned as his poison soup took the life of Joquin ; and new ropes became frayed.</p>
<p>Doluwil's life ended when the string of strange occurrences culminated in a deadly storm. The Vigilant's shipwreck was washed ashore not far from the city of Samargol . Most sailors perished in the storm, while others were captured to be eaten by the Batiri .</p>
