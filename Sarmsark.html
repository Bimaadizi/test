<p>Sarmsark was a common type of ale found and brewed all around the Sea of Fallen Stars as of the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The ale was a bitter and strong-tasting drink, flavored with orange rind, leaving a marmalade -like aftertaste in the drinker's mouth. Despite its flavor, Sarmsark was low in alcohol and allowed tavern goers to consume a great amount before becoming incapacitated. This made the drink a popular libation in cheap taverns.</p>
<p>The brewing recipe was widely-known, and Sarmsark was created all around the nations of the Inner Sea, such as Sembia , Thesk , Turmish , and many others.</p>
