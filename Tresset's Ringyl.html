<p>Tresset's Ringyl was a town in Tressardon , long-destroyed by the mid–8 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Long overgrown, Tresset's Ringyl was full of trees. Only forty buildings were visible over their treetops. There was a castle in the middle, the Ringyl .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Ringyl sat inside a valley. It was east of Felmorel , and further east was the Moonshorn Tower .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Once governed by the bandit Tresset , Tresset's Ringyl had been the seat of the short-lived kingdom of Tressardon that he declared. However, the kingdom just about died with him, surviving him by onluy a few days. According to two guests at a feast in Felmorel , as of 761 DR , these lands were under the control of the Lady of Shadows.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Laughter, 761 DR , Elminster Aumar , a Chosen of Mystra , crossed Tresset's Ringyl while seeking Dasumia ; he found the streets strewn with bones, and much ruin. He also gave the Ringyl a cursory exploration before spending the night in a nearby hilltop. He was briefly attacked by a strange creature he nicknamed Silent Antlers , but prevailed. Unknown to him, upon slaying the creature, some sort of change was wrought at the Ringyl's ruin: a scepter was revealed, and soon snatched up by a sorceress. That sorceress was in fact the Dasumia he sought.</p>
