<p>The sword of riotous revels was a unique enchanted longsword crafted by Laeral Silverhand for Calliope in the late 15 th century DR . It was one of many pieces of so-called " Silverhand gear " crafted for adventurers who helped to protect Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The properties of the sword of riotous revels were directly inspired by Calliope's gift for celebration. The weapon was a dancing sword capable of flying out and inflicting grievous harm by transferring life essence from it's target to Calliope or one of her allies. This transfer of life essence left her allies with a sense that Calliope had shared her joy with them.</p>
