<p>Valashar's Bane was a ship in Cormyr 's navy in the 4th century DR , sailing on the Sea of Fallen Stars . It was the flagship of the fleet and carried Crown Prince Azoun I , until it was wrecked and a sunk in a storm in 389 DR , taking with it many great treasures.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was a fast-running cog , swift enough to overtake pirate vessels on the Inner Sea along the Dragon Coast , though it was not heavily armed.</p>
<p>As a wreck by the mid–14th century DR, the ship's wooden timbers had all rotted away and the copper fittings had rusted away. The only remains were coins , nails , and cutlasses , scattered about and buried under some 10 inches (0.25 meters) of mud, which protected from corrosion.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The ship was named in honor of Prince Azoun's victories over the realm of Valashar in the Year of the Leaping Hare, 376 DR . It became the prince's pride and joy.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Wooded Altar, 389 DR , Azoun sailed Valashar's Bane to the Vilhon Reach , on a trade mission to Arrabar . Prince Azoun and the trainee Royal Wizard Amedahast slipped away to explore elven ruins in the Chondalwood , where they ran into Dima , the self-proclaimed Djinni -Lord, a marauding mage. They killed Dima and took away his treasure and magical relics.</p>
<p>However, on the return voyage later that year, Valashar's Bane was hit by a bad storm on the Sea of Fallen Stars, which caught the prince and crew by surprise. The ship holed its hull on the rocks of the Neck , around 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of the Darkflow River . Taking on water, the prince and his crew limped back as close to Cormyr as they could, before the ship finally sank 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) from the shore.</p>
<p>Fortunately, no lives had been lost in the sinking, much to the prince's relief. He and all the crew escaped in smaller boats and landed on shore west of the Darkflow, a day later at dawn. Azoun described the moment as "the best gleaming dawn seen in Cormyr yet". However, he regretted the loss of Valashar's Bane , which had taken the royal sword Ilbratha with it, along with lesser regalia and the treasures won by Azoun on the expedition.</p>
<p>To later generations of Cormyreans, Ilbratha became a symbol of the glory and bounty lost with Valashar's Bane . It became one of the Lost Blades , official pieces of Cormyr's regalia sought for by authorities and adventurers. However, the sword resurfaced very soon after when it was recovered by two fishermen from Teziir , who sold it on.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>On the surface, Valashar's Bane sank 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) from the shore and 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of the Darkflow River , just within the Lake of Dragons . It came to rest at a depth of around 95 feet (29 meters), on a rocky patch of seafloor, some 39 miles (63 kilometers) due east of Nalufaen , a city of the sea elf realm of Naramyr .</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>Valashar's Bane was carrying some impressive treasures back to Cormyr when it went down, much of it taken from Dima the Djinni-Lord. These included:</p>
<p>However, at least one of these— Ilbratha —was quickly recovered. The rest were presumed to remain within the wreck and debris of Valashar's Bane .</p>
