<p>Egil Hakon was a dwarven cleric and mining foreman in Hal Stoutheart 's Tethyamar expedition during the 1480s DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Egil had gray hair and a tidy beard. He carried a pickaxe and small hammer .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As a cleric , Egil could call upon the powers of fire storm , energy drain , and blade barrier . After being drawn to madness, he began using necromancy with enthusiasm to reanimate his former companions.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the expedition, Egil worked in Mineshaft 214S with other miners as they searched for the jewels of ardor . His companion Brin Coldstone was actually the demon lord Graz'zt , who shared maddening whispers with Egil and drove him into a peculiar and murderous state. Egil proceeded to spontaneously and violently murder all his fellow miners with his pickaxe except for Hagen Silverthumb , who managed to outrun him. He then set about reanimating his victims as the undead , putting them to work mining the jewels and defending his tunnel from any intruders. Among his minions was an ancient dwarven battlerager .</p>
<p>Hagen escaped to the Tethyamar Mining Outpost to warn the others, and found Asta 's hirelings from Cormyr ready to help. He sent them down into the mines to slay Egil, who happily welcomed the visitors before realizing they weren't going to let him neatly kill and reanimate them. After an intense fight, he fell, putting an end to the tragedy but leaving the cause of it all a mystery.</p>
