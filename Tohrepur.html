The city formerly sat on the shores of the Akanamere but when the Spellplague dried up the lake, the waters receded and the city was left beyond the waters reach. The Abolethic Sovereignty destroyed Tohrepur in 1473 DR and turned its residents into aberrations . Tohrepur was then the home of a plaguechanged Sirine who was worshiped by a cult known as The Choir .</p>
