<p>Maran or Mari was a language spoken by the Mar people of the Utter East . It was categorized in the Midani subgroup of the Untheric group of the Rauric languages family, and was most closely related to the languages of Zakhara .</p>
<p>Sounding strange yet melodious to Atreus Eleint 's ears, Maran was composed of many short syllables and employed throaty or guttural clicks. The Maran people often spoke it quite rapidly. The people of Langdarma spoke a dialect that was comparatively soft and delicate, and seemingly more ancient.</p>
<p>The phrase " Ekc'kta reeto " apparently meant "She is telling the truth" in Maran, but when Atreus tried it and could not manage the throat click, it came out as "The yaks are very honest." However, since he had the deceitful Rishi Saubhari as a translator, it is hard to say for sure what either phrase truly meant. [ speculation ]</p>
<p>Mar writers used the word "parshan" to refer to the foreigners ( Ffolk ) who'd settled their lands in 621 DR .</p>
<p>" Sahib " was an honorific used in Maran.</p>
