<p>Ruler's Ridge , or Calim's See , was a peak in the Marching Mountains . It was one of the locations where the bakkals of Coramshan were buried and then the site of a great genie battle.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ruler's Ridge was located in the northern Marching Mountains near Minthrux Vale and Bottle Falls , where the Two Falls River began. It was once called Calim's See. At that time, the mountain was some 500 feet taller. A great avalanche turned what used to be a large, conical mountain into a jagged-edged peak.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Calim's See was once the burial site of choice for the bakkals of Coramshan and the rulers of the first seven dynasties of Calimshan . After being mummified in the First Necropolis of Nykkar , the dead were carted up a road around the mountain and through a set of golden doors in a cliff-side.</p>
<p>The entrance to the tombs was lost to time, buried beneath rock and earth in −1990 DR , when a group of more than six djinn , efreet , and dao fought in the mountains in a battle that lasted months and led to the death of a noble dao . The magical battle cleft the mountain in two and shattered its peak, burying the entrance to the tombs and the road leading up to it.</p>
<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>A gluttonous aurumvorax that was as large as a dragon was rumored to live on the mountain.</p>
