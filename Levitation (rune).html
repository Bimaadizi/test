They soon determined that he was still be alive, albeit critically injured. Realizing they needed a way to transport Morten's large body back to Castle Hartwick , Basil shaved the man's hairy chest and then used the fresh blood oozing from his bandaged neck to paint the levitation rune upon the former. Trailing behind them as they made their way there, Morten's floating body eventually reached the castle and was left in the hands of the High Priest Simon .</p>
