<p>Onskrar Hammershield was the Shieldlord (governor) of the city of Khôltar , south Faerûn , from the Year of the Thoughtful Man, 374 DR , to the Year of the Ambitious Sycophant, 424 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hammershield was appointed Shieldlord of Khôltar by the dwarves of the Deep Realm after the previous Shieldlord, Amberu Khôltar , was assassinated in a failed attempt to implicate the human population of the city and cause strife. One of his first acts was to calm the outraged citizens by forming an advisory council that could draft laws for his approval and give guidance in matters related to public works and governance. No such organization had existed under Amberu's rule.</p>
<p>The council originally had twelve old and experienced human crafters, four dwarves, two gnomes , and a halfling , plus eight seasonal appointees. Over the next two hundred years, this governor's council evolved into what became known as the Onsruur , but Onskrar did not live to see it (or prevent it). Tragically, he was killed while inspecting a tower that had been built by a group of humans—the building accidentally collapsed while he was touring inside with no evidence of foul play. Shortly thereafter, Gonth "Merrybelt" Forgegold was appointed to replace him.</p>
