<p>The Dun Hills were a mountain range in southwest Faerûn , lying between Lapaliiya and the Shaar .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Dun Hills were a series of low hills that formed the western edge of the Channath Vale . Stretching northward from the Bandit Wastes in the south, they arced toward the east into the Shaar. On the western side were the coastal lands around the Shining Sea . On the eastern and southeastern sides were the Misty Vale and Shaareach . The road between Sheirtalar and Kormul ran beside the northern face.</p>
<p>The Cliffs of Talar and the River Talar ran east to west through the range, bisecting it into southern and northern parts, sometimes treated as two distinct ranges. The southern part was still known as the Dun Hills, while the northern part was sometimes known as the Wormbones . One tail of the range, called the Cauldron , stretched east to Kormul. Another tail, still called the Wormbones, arced northwest to the city of Ormpur on the coast of the Shining Sea.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>On the Lapaliiyan side, the western slopes supported little vegetation bar some scrub and the occasional olive grove. Local tribes managed herds of goats, but some ran wild.</p>
<p>The eastern slopes were thickly blanketed in mists and trees, as they descended into the Misty Vale.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Some goat-herding tribes dwelled in the hills. The wild elves of the Misty Vale thankfully did not venture very far west into the hills.</p>
<h2>Locations</h2>
<p>Sheirlantar , the Tomb City of Lapaliiya, stood on the western slopes by the River Talar. For centuries, it was a custom of the Lapaliiyan upper classes to bury the most important among them in the hills above Sheirlantar. Thus, by 1373 DR , many tombs and crypts were scattered over the central part of the range, and undead were an ever-present threat there, though the priests of Kelemvor continually tried to eradicate them.</p>
