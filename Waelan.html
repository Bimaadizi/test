<p>Waelan was the native language of the Ffolk .</p>
<h2>Speakers</h2>
<p>Waelan was spoken by the Ffolk of the southern Moonshaes , although by 1372 DR the majority of Ffolk in the Isles spoke the Illuskan language of the Northlanders who had invaded their native home.</p>
<p>The Ffolk who had migrated to the Five Kingdoms of the Utter East also spoke Waelan.</p>
<h2>Dialects</h2>
<p>There were two major dialects of Waelan, Proper (spoken in the Moonshaes) and Five Kingdoms (spoken in the Utter East). The two dialects were substantially different from each other as a result of their separation. Five Kingdoms Waelan was comparatively isolated by the Utter East's mountainous borders, yet also influenced by the Northmen settlers who'd accompanied the Ffolk and by corsairs and merchants from across south Faerûn and north Zakhara .</p>
