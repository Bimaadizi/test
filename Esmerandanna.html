<p>Esmerandanna , known as the Resplendent Queen and the Daul of Thard , was a great wyrm emerald dragon who laired in Emerald Crater among the Peaks of Flame in Chult .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Esmerandanna made her lair within the Emerald Crater shortly after the eruption of the volcano in the Year of the Quivering Mountains, 77 DR . She lived there ever since.</p>
<p>Esmerandanna was something of a sage and she took a keen interest in the traditions and history of the wild dwarves , who wandered the surrounding jungles. Although at first she feared they would only desire to steal her hoard, with the customary emerald dragon paranoia, this gradually faded over the centuries and was replaced with a firm friendship with the various priests of their god, Thard Harr , the Lord of the Jungle Deeps. Esmerandanna even accepted them storing their most sacred runestones within her lair and under her protection.</p>
<p>Thus, the Emerald Crater, or Morndin Vertesplendarrorn to the wild dwarves, remained one of their most sacred sites, rather than abandoning it in a generation or so as was their habit. They returned often to worship Thard, make their carvings, and leave them in the care of their guardian dragon, whom they held in their mythology to be the daughter, or daul , of Thard Harr.</p>
<p>She was known to still be alive after the Dracorage in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR .</p>
