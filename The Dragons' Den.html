<p>The Dragons' Den was a tavern in the town of Thunderstone in Cormyr in the late 1360s DR , owned by Oleg One-Ear .</p>
<p>The tavern was taken over by the rowdy Purple Dragons garrison in town, quite against Oleg's original wishes, but he knew to mind his own business.</p>
<p>It became the soldiers' own hangout, and catered exclusively to them. Civilians who dared step inside without a Purple Dragon companion—and this happened only rarely—were likely to be pelted with tankards and even chairs. Those who persisted were beaten up and thrown out.</p>
<p>With patrons like these, the Den had no need of a bouncer.</p>
