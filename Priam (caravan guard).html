<p>Priam was a caravan guard. He was a lanky man with a fierce trap of a mouth, admired for his courage. On Flamerule 12 of the Year of Moonfall, 1344 DR , he was helping guide a caravan to Yulash from Hillsfar when he discovered a Flight of Dragons . Though frightened, he kept his wits about himself, and led the caravan to hide in the tall grass. Though most of the flight passed it by, they were then attacked by a hungry red dragon . Janx suggested they scatter, but Priam talked him out of it: both were slain by the dragon, which then killed the rest of the caravan. The only survivor was a badly maimed, 9-year old Dorn Graybrook .</p>
