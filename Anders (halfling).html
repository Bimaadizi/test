<p>Anders was a carpenter, caravans hand, and an assistant to merchant Madoc of the Shield Trading Company in the late-14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Madoc and Anders took their caravan from the Dalelands to the city of Voonlar . Weary of vengeance of Madoc's previous employer - the Black Network, and the recent fiend raids along the roads of the Moonsea, the merchant spared no expense in hiring a well-known hero from the city of Daggerford for 10,000 gold pieces .</p>
<p>Just within reach of Voonlar, the caravan wagon lost its wheel, causing Madoc to go into a rage. Thankfully, Anders' repair was swift, and the caravan reached the city soon after. However, the halfling's fix was not as sturdy as everyone thought, and the wagon completely fell apart as the caravan entered the city, barely reaching the Shield Trading Company. Predicting the dwarf's anger, Anders scampered away before being held responsible for the disastrous end of the journey.</p>
