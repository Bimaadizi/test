<p>The drow smoke goggles were a set of magical goggles found during the Battle for Eveningstar .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These goggles had dark yellow crystal lenses to allow their drow wearers to tolerate the light of the sun while on surface raids.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Beyond allowing drow to tolerate exposure to sunlight, this pair had been further enchanted to help the wearer locate and strike vulnerable areas on their foes. However, the darkly tinted lenses could somewhat hinder the normal vision of someone who was already acclimated to sunlight.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Due to the enhanced enchantments on the goggles, it is speculated that this pair must have belonged to someone important.</p>
<p>In the mid-1480s DR , during the Battle for Eveningstar, the goggles were taken from the Drow Field Headquarters on the outskirts of Eveningstar .</p>
