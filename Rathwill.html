<p>When he was confronted by a group of heroes that followed the Cult in search of abducted villagers, Rathwill assumed the new faces were nothing but fellow members of the Cult of the Dragon. At the time he was not particularly worried about intruders as he felt safe being guarded by two cult sentries.</p>
