<p>El Nar'ysr , which means " The Phoenix " in Alzhedo , was one of the most prolific prophets ever to live on Toril , with greater divinatory power than even Alaundo the Seer, famous for many thousands of predictions later recorded in a multi-volume work entitled The Phoenix Prophecies .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Nar'ysr, whose real name was lost to history, was one of the Abbalayar , a group of humans so unique to be considered a different race altogether. He had reddish skin and golden-colored hair.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The Phoenix was a quiet man who rarely spoke, but when he felt a prophecy coming upon him, he spoke with boldness.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Nar'ysr was known to have had descendants, though only a few of these inherited his prophetic powers or distinct physical traits.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Nar'ysr lived in the time of Calimshan 's ancient past before even the end of the Calim Empire . During his life, he gave thousands of cryptic prophecies.</p>
<p>His prophecies were recorded sometime in the tenth century DR by the Herald Swordswreath . She composed a seven-volume work from source fragments and a manuscript passed on by the Abbalayar prophet Kadh yn Ororm al Mjol . This opus was titled The Phoenix Prophecies . Among these more than 8,000 prophecies, the Nar'ysr predicted the deaths of Bane , Bhaal , and Myrkul , the nine Ages of Calimshan , the Eye Tyrant Wars , the Time of Troubles , and the attack of the Tuigan Horde .</p>
