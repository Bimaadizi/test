<p>Belvyn's House of Good Cheer was a combined festhall , all-faiths temple, and rental hall in the settlement of Bargewright Inn in the Savage Frontier in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . It was owned and rented out by Belvyn .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It stood in the upper part of Bargewright Inn, on the central northern side between Tabra's and Shondrin's Packsack of Plenty on the street known as the Rise.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The building was a tall and slender hall, with a steep roof. The layout was simple and open. Along its high crossbeams ran catwalk galleries.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The hall was available to hire for 25 gp for a night. Typically, it was used as either a festhall or a temple, as incongruous as those might seem. For the former, the hall was hired for revels by a variety of organizations, usually mercantile leagues, the guilds of Waterdeep getting out of the city, and adventuring companies passing through and look to celebrate some victory. Such groups regularly hired many of the escorts from the neighboring Tabra's for the evening.</p>
<p>If hired as temple, then worshipers were provided with a plain altar and braziers if required. Any non-violent religion was permitted, as well as those of Helm and Tempus , while that of Malar was expressed excluded.</p>
<p>Free of charge, one could also hold a funeral here.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>A recurring rumor in the area claimed that, hidden somewhere within or beneath the House of Good Cheer, were many chests filled with gold pieces . This was easily discredited, however: the building had no hiding places and not an errant copper piece was ever turned up.</p>
