<p>Rurik of Winterglen was the Northlander captain of the Winterglen Claw , a band of human rebels and escaped slaves fighting against their fey oppressors within Sarifal in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Rurik was a short man with big hands. He had a black beard (that was graying by the late 15 th century DR) with a gruesome scar that bisected his lips, making him distinctly ugly. He had steel teeth .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Rurik was brave, blunt, crass, and could be bitingly sarcastic. He was eager to jump into action, grew impatient with delays, and had difficulty controlling his temper. He despised the le Shay and Llewyrr rulers of Sarifal, having known them to be arrogant, debaucherous, and treacherous slavers. He also despised the long-lived fey of Sarifal more generally, accusing them of having stolen the future and culture of his people on Gwynneth . For this reason, he reveled in killing fey and dreamt of the day that he would throw off the yoke of their oppression.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>In battle, he wore battered chainmail , a steel cap , and seaboots . He wielded an axe but was also skilled with swords , and he kept a blade concealed on his person. He rode a powerful and swift horse .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He counted Lord Mindarion of Synnoria as an ally, believing that the elf was amenable to his desires to be free of the fey in ways that others of his kind were not.</p>
<p>He and Suka , a gnomish traitor to Sarifal, found that they had many similar feelings towards the rulers of their realm. Suka respected his conviction but not his intelligence.</p>
<p>He did not particularly trust overtures from King Derid Kendrick , believing the Ffolk king to be a tyrant and only preferable to the fey because he would die much sooner.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He was said to be from the Winterglen . As of the late 15 th century DR, Captain Rurik had gained a level of infamy that made both High Lady Ordalf of Sarifal and the humans of Alaron aware of him. In the late 1470s DR, he attracted the notice of House Kendrick , who nominally were interested in acquiring his loyalty in exchange for arms and support in his rebellion. Lord Aldon Kendrick travelled to Gwynneth aboard the Sphinx to meet with him and ask for an oath of fealty to High King Derid Kendrick, although this mission was undermined by Aldon's rivals within the Kendrick family, who tipped off spies of High Lady Ordalf. Some of Derid's message managed to reach Rurik only after he and his men rescued one of the crew of the Sphinx , the gnome named Suka.</p>
<p>Soon after, Rurik travelled with his troops, their ally Lord Mindarion, Suka, and a fomorian princess named Marabaldia to a meeting at Harrowfast , a citadel above Synnoria, where an alliance had been proposed among Rurik's Winterglen Claw, Mindarion's Knights of Synnoria , and Marabaldia's fomorian tribes to march against the ruling le Shay in Karador . Rurik and the fomorians were eager to march, but were unable to reconcile disagreements with the Llewyrr elves of Synnoria, notably Lord Askepel , who took over negotiations from Mindarion after the latter had to rest to recover from a battle with the le Shay's drow servants. Whereas Rurik insisted on liberation from the le Shay, the Llewyrr wished instead to install a different le Shay, Lady Amaranth , to the throne.</p>
<p>During a pause in the faltering negotiations, as it had become clear to Rurik that his hope of marching on Karador was slipping away, he and Suka retired to a lookout point above Synnoria where they were attacked by a wild wyvern . Descending the mountain to escape, they accidentally trespassed into the forbidden valley of the elves, and were accosted by three guards led by the Marchlord Oemeril Talos–claere . The elves insisted that no deed or words could absolve them of the crime they had committed simply by being non-fey inside their woods, and immediately assumed them to be escaped slaves. Rurik pretended to capitulate to Talos–claere before killing him and another guard while Suka slew the remaining one. Returning to Harrowfast, Rurik now had cemented the end of any possible alliance, and immediately departed with his troops. He invited Suka to join him, but she refused. He wished her luck and told her to lay the blame for the killings all on him.</p>
