<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Prugdush was a tall and surprisingly muscular humanoid, of otherwise typical appearance for a sahuagin. He did not seem to be bothered by the sweltering heat of his forge.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Prugdush Glurp had trouble differentiating warm-blooded humanoids from one another, calling them "soft-skins" and used his sense of smell as a reliable tool in dealing with land-dwellers.</p>
<p>The sahuagin blacksmith often joked about eating his customers, but in reality, it was explicitly forbidden for him to do by the priestesses of Umberlee in Spindrift Town. Prugdush was quite friendly otherwise.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Prugdush Glurp was a blacksmith who created and sold a wide variety of armors and weapons. He also offered armor upgrades. His blacksmiths single-handedly outfitted the town's pirate fleet.</p>
