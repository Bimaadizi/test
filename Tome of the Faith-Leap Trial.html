<p>Tome of the Faith-Leap Trial was a textbook used to teach Sharran initiates to trust the holy path of darkness that was printed in the ancient times, long before the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>The purpose of the Tome of the Faith-Leap Trial was to help young initiates pass the faith-leap trial, which was part of the Gauntlet of Shar and a right of passage for Dark Justiciars of the Church. It instructed the acolytes to step into Shar's darkness and be guided by her along a perilous veering path across an invisible bridge. The tome claimed that those whose heart was closed to the Nightsinger were doomed to plummet into the darkness underneath.</p>
