<p>Hillsafar Hall was the largest of the three major dwarven holds in the Galena Mountains , along with Ironspur and Bloodstone Mines , as of the mid–14 th century DR . It was the most impressive fortress in Vaasa , and stood at the entrance to the mines of Clan Hillsafar .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Hillsafar Hall was located in the Galena Mountains on the eastern edge of the Sunderland region in southeastern Vaasa. It was about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of the Vaasan Gate of Bloodstone Pass , and it was rumored that an underground tunnel ran that whole distance. The Hall sat at the entrance to a series of caverns that were rich in bloodstone and copper .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Hillsafar Hall was said to produce piles of gems , which the dwarves primarily traded via Bloodstone Pass. They also had their own route directly through the mountains to the Moonsea via Gramble's Climb .</p>
<p>Following the takeover of the Pass and the rest of Vaasa by the Warlock Knights , all trade in and out of Hillsafar Hall ceased.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The sole purpose of Hillsafar Hall's outer chambers was defense. Behind the main gates from the surface was a 100‑foot (30‑meter) tunnel lined with arrow slits on both sides, murder holes on the ceiling, and concealed spring blade traps on the floor. Once inside the first chamber, four ballistae were positioned in the corners with full coverage of the room, and access to these positions were protected by cleverly concealed pit traps that would close with metal grates to lock victims inside. Beyond that room was a short hall with two more ballistae and a portcullis. A force of between fifty and one-hundred elite dwarven guards were always on duty within these chambers, and several hundred more were always ready to reinforce them. In times of war, the main gates could be sealed to keep out all would-be invaders.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The dwarves of the Galena Mountains claimed to have been the first civilized folk to settle the Bloodstone Lands . By 1359 DR , Hillsafar Hall was the greatest of these dwarven settlements, and its king, Garumbelly "Grumble" Hillsafar , was probably the greatest warrior in Vaasa. As a result, Gareth Dragonsbane of Damara believed it to be vitally important to secure their help in taming Vaasa following the defeat of Zhengyi the Witch-King .</p>
<p>After Palischuk was settled by half-orcs in the late 1350s DR, Hillsafar Hall was one of the last settlements, even among the dwarves, to accept them.</p>
<p>The Warlock Knights of Vaasa attacked both Hillsafar Hall and Bloodstone Mines in 1470 DR . Gaurumbelly's third son, Borigon Hillsafar , claimed the mantle of king and led his clan in repelling the invaders. He then accepted dwarven refugees from neighboring clans, including Clan Orothiar of Bloodstone Mines, before sealing the main gates. As of 1480 DR , there had been no contact between Hillsafar Hall and the outside world, although the clans were preparing to retake Bloodstone Mines.</p>
