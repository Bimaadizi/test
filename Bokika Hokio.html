<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bokika was the daimyo of Juzimura . However, he granted protection to the followers of Chauntea , who were persecuted by the shogun 's government, believing himself safe as nephew of the Shogun Matasuuri Nagahide .</p>
<p>He was wrong, and around 1335 DR , the shogun's army surrounded his castle, asking for the lives of Chauntea's worshipers. After a bloody and futile siege, Nagahide offered to spare Hokio and his officials, even allowing them to retain their status. However, Hokio was demoted to a tozama daimyo and granted lordship over the far and poor Fochu .</p>
<p>Around 1348 DR , he was visited by the spirits of the dead priests of Chauntea, who asked him for a proper resting place for their remains. In deep secrecy, Hokio had a crypt constructed deep in his palace in Fochu and put the remains inside, killing all of his vassals involved to keep the secret.</p>
<p>In 1358 DR , in a dream, the spirits of the priests appeared again, asking for an offering of food. Hokio spoke with Chiguo Ihario , a wakadoshiyori sent by the shogun to assist and control Hokio. He told Chiguo that the spirits were followers of the Path of Enlightenment .</p>
<p>With Chiguo's collaboration, Hokio hired a foreign adventuring party to solve the matter. The adventurers discovered that it was a trap devised by a lu .</p>
