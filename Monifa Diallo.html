<p>Monifa Diallo was a human commoner from the Rivington district of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Monifa was dressed in simple, colorless commoner's garb. She had light brown skin, curly brown hair, and brown eyes. Her ears were pierced with simple, tiny loop earrings.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the army assembled by the Cult of the Absolute moved from the Moonrise Towers in Chionthar Valley to menace the city of Baldur's Gate , displacing countless refugees in the process along the way. Pressured by the refugee crisis, Baldur's Gate closed the Wyrm's Crossing bridge, separating Rivington from other parts of the metropolis and turning it into a refugee tent city. Monifa Diallo, who inhabited the district, did not share its' residents' flaring xenophobia and showed disgust with the Upper City , believing it did not care for the looming danger and possible deaths of everyone in Rivington.</p>
