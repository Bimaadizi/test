<p>Satyrs , also known as fauns or the Free Folk , were fey creatures that delighted in singing, dancing, feasting, and debauchery.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Satyrs looked like male humanoids of stout build, with fur-covered lower bodies and legs and cloven hooves similar to those of a goat . Similarly, goat-like horns topped their heads; these came in a variety of shapes and sizes, from small nubs to big curling ones akin to a ram. They were typically seen with facial hair and wild, curly heads of hair that ranged in length. Younger satyrs tended to keep their hair short, while older satyrs would just let it grow until it hung about their shoulders.</p>
<p>They had only a male sex, as female satyrs was a phenomenon that just never naturally occurred.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Satyrs were well known for being curious and incredibly hedonistic. They were willing to go to any length to achieve their desires, giving little thought to the results of their actions, and often roped other creatures into participating in debauchery.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>When facing a foe, satyrs were typically known to fight with either a shortsword , shortbow , or longbow . Their most notable weapon was a set of pan pipes that induced a variety of magical effects on their enemies, including charming , frightening, and lulling them to sleep . Other satyrs were immune to the effects of these pipes.</p>
<p>When weapons were not available in close quarters situations they often would simply ram their opponents with their heads.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Due to their hedonistic nature, satyrs were known to frequently join in the celebration of holidays regardless of what they were for.</p>

<h3>Reproduction</h3>

They also shared the dryads' affection for humans of the opposite sex. Such pairings were likely to result in a child that was a half-fey human, rather than a true satyr.</p>
