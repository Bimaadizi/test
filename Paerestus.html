<h2>History</h2>
<p>Paerestus was a famous bard.</p>
<p>Some time after the Year of the Quiet Earth, 1161 DR , Paerestus bought Wythyndle's Round Book from Lord Irlistir of Ulkan for a goodly amount of money. This was a magical and holy book of Milil , Lord of Song, and Paerestus felt it to be a gift of the gods, but only ever listened to and learned the music it played, for later use with lyrics of his own. He kept the Round Book stashed in a secret space in the decaying stone wall of the stables behind his house.</p>
<p>Paerestus died in a house-fire one morning in the Year of the Tomb, 1182 DR . Though his house was burned down, the Round Book survived unscathed in the stables. It was eventually rediscovered by another, likely someone robbing out building stones.</p>
