<p>Kronus Seven Scars was a ranking member of the Order of the One Light , a cult that worshiped Crenshinibon in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Like other cultists, Kronus Seven Scars consumed shards of black ice created by Crenshinibon . The evil substance changed their bodies and gave them magical abilities, but also tainted their minds and made them hear the "whispers" from the crystal. Kronus used curseing magics against his opponents and teleported away from harm. His other abilities included charged blast of dark magics and focused beams. He also could encase himself in an ice tomb that temporarily made the cultist immune to all cold damage and immediately froze anyone foolish enough to approach Kronus.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR , after the war against Akar Kessell was over, many entities attacked Icewind Dale , all searching for Crenshinibon . The Order of the One Light was among those malevolent groups. Kronus Seven Scars, was among the cultists who used their dark magics to raise Akar Kessell as a powerful spell-casting undead on the Spine of the World .</p>
