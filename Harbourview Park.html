The park held several trees and some shrubbery, with two benches on both sides of the passage that ended in arches. A single drinking fountain was built into the side of the building that formed one of the triangle plot's edges.</p>

In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , during the Absolute crisis , the park was frequented by healer Sylbert and Twitch Broven , commoners of the Lower City.</p>
