<p>Scions of Grolantor were powerful gargantuan titans that slumbered within a cradle , a massive elemental creature. Together, they were so immense and old that they were confused for hills.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A typical scion of Grolantor was a 50 feet (15 meters) tall giant .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>A roused scion was ravenous, devouring everything in its way. With its powerful lungs, a scion could suck food into its gullet from a great distance, and "food" included living creatures, as well as other foodstuffs.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>These giants were resistant to cold, fire, and lightning. They also were resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage done with non-magical weapons. They were fully immune to all poisons , exhaustion, and being paralyzed. Additionally, they were resistant to spells and magical effects.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>When a scion of Grolantor was roused from its sleep, the cradle of the hill scion was the first to emerge as a mass of stone, dirt, and roots. Only when the cradle was destroyed the scion was fully awakened. They wielded unrooted trees as clubs .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Slumbering scions that formed hills often became sites of importance where villages were settled and stone structures were erected. Each of the scions of Grolantor possessed innate magic that coursed through the hill above, leading to any settlements thriving with bountiful crops, perfect farming weather, and abundant, fast-growing livestock. These effects stretched for six miles around the slumbering creature. One sign that a particularly arid hill might be a scion of Grolantor was a tree that grew from the hill's crest. Another clue was that the magic of the sleeping scion greatly empowered all hill giants within 1,000 feet (300 meters). If the scion of Grolantor that produced any of these effects was slain, all of the magic was also gone.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>One notable slumbering scion of Grolantor was a secret that slept underneath the Holrow Homestead , a farm that produced quality foods imbued with magics, run by Arthur Holrow in the late 15 th century DR . The Holrow Homestead was built on a hill, close to the Delimbiyr River , upstream from the town of Daggerford .</p>
