Their second power enabled a wearer to harm golems with any form of weapon, overcoming their immunity to non-magical weapons.</p>
<p>When it came to the second power, there were different types of pins that could affect golems. Most affected only a single type of golem. The second most expensive affected flesh golems , clay golems , and wood golems . And the most expensive type affected all forms of golem. All the other types but the latter were virtually unknown by 1372 DR ; the general one became known as a golembane scarab .</p>
