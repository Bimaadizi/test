<p>Ate`Niah was the Serene Matriarch of Synnoria on the Moonshae Isles and ruler of the Llewyrr elves through the 14 th and 15 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was both very old and very beautiful, and her thin face revealed her many centuries of age and wisdom despite being free of wrinkles or lines. She often responded to new or surprising events with no more than a twist or tightening of her lips.</p>
<p>She wore perfectly coiffed silver hair that coiled around her head, atop which she bore a small platinum tiara studded with diamonds . She was known to dress in pearl -colored gowns .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was haughty and arrogant, especially in the face of humans and other races whom her people saw as lesser. She spoke coolly, and while her words were always carefully chosen to be formal, they were easily interpreted as back-handed insults. She was not easily impressed with the achievements of human heroes and rulers, and given her long life, she was prone to refer to decades-old events as having happened in the recent past, which humans could find off-putting.</p>
<p>Despite her cool and arrogant disposition, she was not above expressing regret, sadness, or other somber emotions in front of visitors.</p>
<p>While she valued meticulousness in her appearance, she was unafraid to hold an audience in muddy boots or dirty gowns if urgency called for it. She was also known to find a certain amusement at seeing arguments erupt in her court.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>She presided over the Llewyrr and the Elders of the Llewyrr from her palace of Argen-Tellirynd in the city of Chrysalis . She held court in a sunlight-filled chamber as she sat upon an ornately carved wooden throne .</p>
<p>While disinterested in the affairs and events of the human realms of the Moonshae Isles, she was not wholly unaware of them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the appearance of the Elf-Eater in Chrysalis during the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR , Ate`Niah and her Elders met with Alicia and Robyn Kendrick , who had come to request her aid in rescuing High King Tristan Kendrick from the scrags of the Coral Kingdom . Ate`Niah acknowledged that she and her people were unable to provide them with the help they needed, but that such aid could be found on Evermeet .</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, Ate`Niah and her kingdom had sworn allegiance to High Lady Ordalf of Sarifal . Even so, the Serene Matriarch maintained friendly contact with High King Derid Kendrick of Alaron despite the tensions between Synnoria and the Ffolk .</p>
