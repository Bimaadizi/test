<p>Volas Dyervolk , who was nicknamed the Bear , was the Iron Lord, or Huhrong , of Immilmar in Rashemen during the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Volas was quite clever. He rarely shied away from any disagreement with the Wychlaran when he believed they were incorrect. This prompted his near removal on several occasions, but the Wychlaran developed a grudging respect for Volas' keen insights.</p>
