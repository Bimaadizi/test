<p>Yitriq Rukku was a barbarian and a qaghan of the city of Haxkhun on the Plain of Horses and a member of the Fankiang tribe circa Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) . He was subordinate to the rulers of Li-Raz . The two halves of Haxkhun were governed separately, each having their own qaghan (ruler) and their own administrators.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>A cruel and cowardly tyrant, Rukku was nevertheless snivelling and obsequious to his masters in Li-Raz, doing whatever they commanded. Privately, he resented them for Haxkhun's second-class status amongst the Fankiang tribe, but he wasn't about to oppose them. Although he was an incompetent administrator, he was easily controlled by leaders in Li-Raz and so they tolerated and supported him.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was heavily overweight and rarely looked directly at people.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Rukku held and competed in weekly horse-wrestling contests in Haxkhun. In these, the aim was to wrestle one's horse to the ground before the other. However, these were blatantly fixed to eliminate opponents and dissidents, as well as fatten Rukku's ego. First, he selected his opponents, posting their names only the day before a match. If that person refused to compete, then his family was executed. If that person lost, then he was executed. And since Rukku had his horse made lame before each match, he never lost.</p>
