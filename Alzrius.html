<p>Alzrius was a demon lord titled the Lord of Infernal Light who was primarily concerned with matters of fire and destruction. Its symbol was the infernal flame.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Alzrius chose to appear as a dancing tongue of flame with a blinding white radiance.</p>
<h2>Realm</h2>
<p>Alzrius' realm was the 601 st layer of the Abyss , Conflagratum . The main feature of the layer was a city, long since ruined by war, of fluting architecture and strange geometries. Only Alzrius' palace remained whole and intact.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Alzrius was served by an army of armanites and babaus , which was commanded by a babau called Cleftskull the Blameless. Alzrius was known to send this army on lightning-quick strikes into the Grey Wastes and other planes, where it left a trail of fire and destruction in its path.</p>
<p>At other times, Alzrius was known to seek out mortals in hopes of enticing them to bear its flame into other lands and planes. Occasionally, this ended with the flame incinerating its bearer, but Alzrius was normally generous enough to let its servants live, if only so they could serve again.</p>
<h2>Worship</h2>
<p>Some tanar'ri priests were known to pledge themselves to Alzrius's service.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>It was said that Alzrius' army carried a torch from their lord's body wherever they went in order to spread its "word".</p>
