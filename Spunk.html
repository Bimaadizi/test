<p>Spunk was a gold elf adventuring fighter and mage , noted for his eccentric bond to his hand puppet Grizzard, who operated around Ravens Bluff and the Vast region of North Faerûn in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He had a rather handsome figure, replete with wavy brown hair and soft green eyes. He stood 5 ft 3 in (1.6 m) and weighed 105 pounds (47.6 kilograms).</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Spunk had a rather neutral disposition. He was generally polite and soft spoken, friendly to those he adventured with, and giving off an air of morality and trustworthiness. However, he had very clownish, chaotic neutral tendencies. He was fun-loving, especially if that fun was had at the expense of humans , getting his jollies over the reactions generated by his eccentric puppeteering.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>By the age of 326, Spunk was skilled in the use of daggers , darts , knives , short swords , long swords , long bows , and staves . Out of all of these, he most favored bows and short swords. He was also quite proficient in the art of puppetry and ventriloquism, meaning he could make a puppet speak without visibly moving his lips.</p>
<p>In terms of magic, from his spellbook he kept on hand the spells cantrip , charm person , color spray , confusion , dimension door , flaming sphere , fireball , haste , knock , magic missile , non-detection , shocking grasp , sleep , stinking cloud , and web .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Spunk's favorite attire at the age of 326 was a well-worn set of leather armor . Besides his spellbook he carried a long bow, a +1 short sword , and a pair of bracers of defense . His most prized possession was Grizzard, a wizard hand puppet consisting of a stared robe , pointed hat, and long white beard. He also carried an ensemble of miniature items for the puppet, including a backpack , glasses , pipe , spellbook, and tiny wand .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Throughout his time as an adventurer Spunk had a particular mischievous game that he loved to play on parties of mostly human adventurers. He would introduce himself to such adventuring companies as a skilled fighter looking for work, then if welcomed in would protest that he only travels in the company of his best friend "Grizzard", who he'd describe as a most wise and mysterious wizard that would be a valued member to their company. Once the adventurers seemed willing to his arrangement, he would stick his right hand into a knapsack and produce his hand puppet, introducing it with the full title, "Grizzard The Great and Wonderous, High Purveyor of Prestidigitation and Prince of Preponderance." If the adventurers seemed skeptical of Grizzard, Spunk would then demonstrate his power by having him cast a spell – in actuality casting the spell himself, but speaking verbal components through the puppet and having it perform the somatic gestures.</p>
<p>Whenever he performed ventriloquism with the puppet, Spunk acted earnestly towards it, showing Grizzard the utmost respect. If someone were to ever point out that Grizzard was merely a puppet, Spunk would feign distress and put on a melancholic, sulking act until offered an apology.</p>
<p>Grizzard was performed with a gravely voice and a personality that was both naughty as it was caustic – Spunk reasoned that such a demeanor was befitting of a smart and high stationed wizard. Grizzard was one to bark orders and to refuse making an appearance unless called for by his full title.</p>
<p>However, Spunk would never allow these antics to pose any real danger to those he adventured with and he performed confidently in his duties as a fighter. His ultimate goal with these charades was to get whatever adventuring company he was traveling with to truly believe in Grizzard and accept him as a member of their team. Once this was accomplished, Spunk would wait for an opportunity to sneak away and leave the party, never offering his compatriots any parting words or form of explanation.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The early life of Spunk was a mystery. He himself would assert that he was orphaned as a child in Cormanthor , then discovered and adopted by a clan of elves near the Vale of Lost Voices . When he set out into the world as an adventurer, he did so to fulfill his personal quest of meeting his biological parents.</p>
