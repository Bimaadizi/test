<p>An orb of duo-dimension was an orb that was used in surface raids by the drow .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The orbs' surfaces were—except on the side they were held by— pierced with holes. Inside these orbs were the ashes of a drow.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>An orb of duo-dimension's contents could be shaken out on saying the command word that unsealed the orb's holes. These holes were sealed with invisible magical force, which the command word made relax.</p>
<p>By shaking the contents out on a mammalian creature, the creature was under the effect of a duo-dimension spell for seven minutes. The effect took one minute to manifest and was accompanied by a tingling sensation.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The orb of duo-dimension was a magic item associated with the drow. They used it in their surface raids or sneak attacks in the Underdark . To put simply, they used it every time they wanted to navigate through narrow caverns without opening up big tunnels, which their enemies could use against them.</p>
<p>On his first surface raid, Drizzt Do'Urden was put under the effect of an orb of duo-dimension to enter the surface.</p>
