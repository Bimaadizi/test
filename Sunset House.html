<p>Sunset House was a strange house located in the city of Zhentil Keep during the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The house was located in south Zhentil Keep in the eastern section of the Foreign Quarter right next to the South Cemetery .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Stone gargoyles sat atop the roof of Sunset House. All of the windows were covered with heavy black drapes for privacy.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>A secret passage in the cellar connected to ancient ruins located beneath Zhentil Keep, which in turn connected to tunnels in the Underdark .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>A glyph of warding sealed all of the doors and windows of Sunset House. It would trigger when any non- drow attempted to enter and turn them to stone.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>A group of drow from House Mizzrym dwelled within Sunset House following the destruction of Zhentil Keep in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR . Only Lord Orgauth and the clergy of Loviatar knew of their presence in the city. Lord Orgauth, who, unbeknownst to the drow, was actually a pit fiend in disguise at this time, sold undesirables as slaves to the dark elves. Kebella Mizzrym led the drow stationed here. A sorcerer named Taybar Rozziss and a mind flayer named Xog aided her.</p>
