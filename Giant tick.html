<p>Giant ticks were massive bloodsucking insects.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Some described these parasites as being the size of boars .</p>
<h2>Ability</h2>
<p>Much like their smaller cousins, giant ticks were known to carry fatal diseases that could kill a victim within 2–4 days.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Giant ticks hid on elevated rock formations and trees waiting for a warm-blooded prey to drop onto. On a successful bite with their hollow mouth-tube, the giant tick attached to the victim draining its blood until the insect was full and bloated.</p>
<p>After a giant tick attached to its victim, it had to be killed, burned, or immersed in water for it to detach before it reached satiation.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1357 DR and up to 1368 DR , giant ticks could occasionally be found in the sewers beneath Waterdeep .</p>
