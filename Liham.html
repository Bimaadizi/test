<p>Liham , located at the mouth of Al-Sari River , was the most southerly of Zakhara 's Free Cities circa 1367 DR .</p>
<p>It also lay nearest to powerful Qudra , which, together with the presence of several mamluk units, gave the larger city enormous influence on Liham's politics. The large military led to the title " City of Soldiers ", but it was also called Liham the Red , because the citizens enjoyed wearing clothing in various shades of crimson.</p>
