<p>The Shop of Secrets was a shop in Myth Drannor that catered to wizards and other spellcasters in the city, specializing in hard-to-find items of an arcane nature.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The shop was located on the Street of Song in the Sheshyrinnam district of Myth Drannor.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The ground floor of the two-story building was largely dedicated to the storage of merchandise and the proud display of preserved and stuffed beasts and monsters, many of which were slain by adventurers .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The proprietor of the shop, Aster Enoctor offered a great variety of rare spell components , much of which were extremely difficult to procure. Aster prided himself on the ability to obtain any item or substance that was placed on order, regardless of rarity or origin, if given enough time. While this was always the case, the wait time could go on for a number of years and cost a patron a great deal of money.</p>
<p>He also offered something rather unique and novel, the skill of being able to preserve, stuff and mount slain creatures, to display for others to see.</p>
