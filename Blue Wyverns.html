<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Jack Ravenwild hired the Blue Wyverns at a pay rate of 500 gold pieces each to help him recover the Sarkonagael , a spellbook of shadow magic from the ancient dwarven city of Sarbreen located beneath Ravens Bluff. In Sarbreen, the group fought and defeated a tribe of troglodytes who were in service to a beholder . Once they found the book in the Temple of the Soulforger they had to fight Myrkyssa Jelan 's gang, the Moon Daggers , for possession of the book.</p>
<p>Later, Jack hired the Blue Wyverns to back him up when he delivered a shadow simulacrum of himself to a mage who was trying to imprison Jack once again in the mythal beneath Ravens Bluff. Jack hired the group a third time to ambush and capture the notorious slaver Fetterfist . The fourth service performed for Jack was on the house as the band rushed to a nobleman's party to drive off Fetterfist's gang and a group of drow who intended to kill as many nobles as possible and enslave the rest.</p>
