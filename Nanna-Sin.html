<p>Nanna-Sin was the Untheric god of the moon. His manifestation on Toril was killed during the Orcgate Wars . His symbol was a black axe over a moon. He was resurrected as a non-god immortal by Asmodeus in 1487 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nanna-Sin manifested as a human male bathed in blue light that beguiled all who came within ten feet of it. At will, he could negate any heat, cold, electricity, light, or darkness effects. In battle he wielded the Black Axe of the Moon's Champion , a jet-black axe.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nanna-Sin presumedly came to Toril with the other Untheric deities aboard the Galley of the Gods . He was killed by one of the orcish gods in −1071 DR , and his body was laid to rest in a God-Tomb in Unther .</p>
<p>In Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , in an event known as the Vanishing , the majority of the citizens of Shussel were magically and mysteriously carried away in a fog. In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , these citizens returned as aasimar and called themselves the Legion of Nanna-Sin . They claimed that Nanna-Sin—perhaps acting as an aspect of Selûne —had taken them to Zigguraxus and transformed and trained them to be his army against the invading Mulhorandi army.</p>
<p>His tomb was destroyed by the fall of a dragonborn djerad during the Spellplague . The dragonborn Thymara , one of the survivors of the catastrophe, was guided to Nanna-Sin's tomb by the goddess Selûne , where she laid her eggs in safety. After the dragonborn constructed Djerad Thymar with the ruins of their djerad and the God-Tomb, they claimed Nanna-Sin as clan-kin to all the Thymari clans, and buried him in a specially build tomb in the lowest section of the Catacombs .</p>
<p>On Hammer 10 of 1487 DR, Enlil agreed to give Nanna-Sin's divine spark to Asmodeus, and in exchange Asmodeus agreed to revive Nanna-Sin as an immortal. After Nanna-Sin was resurrected, he took the form of a giant dragon turtle , to destroy the Untherite navy and lift the siege of Djerad Kethendi .</p>
