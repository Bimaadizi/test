<p>The Nature Seers were a druidic circle of four ancient half- elemental guardians that judged the mortals of Toril who sought them out and served as guardians of nature. Their domain was the Grove of Renewal , located deep beneath the surface of the planet, though they each had domains in locations related to their trials, spread out across all the Realms. Those mortals who sought out these elemental druids within their groves were presented with a series of challenges known as the Purging , which would allow them to understand their history, know their place in the balance of the world, and prepare for a new future.</p>
<p>A number of rumors surrounded the druids and their grove and had spread across the realms. One purported that Silvanus had exiled them beneath the earth after one of their members angered the god, while others stated that the magic of the grove had faded or that evil cult members had taken over the natural holy site.</p>
