<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A vorr stood around 4 feet (1.2 meters) tall. They resembled a black hyena animal native to the Prime Material Plane , but with a face bright with intelligence. The monsters were covered with bristly black-and-gray fur, leaving their long rat tail hairless.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>

The vorr would try and knock their prey off their feet at every opportunity to gain the upper hand.</p>
