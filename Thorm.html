<p>House Thorm was a once-powerful noble house in the Western Heartlands of west Faerûn . They were based at Moonrise Towers in Reithwin within the Shadow-cursed Lands .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Dusken Ride, 986 DR , a great battle fought between Dark Justiciars of Shar and druids and Selûnites ; hundreds were slain. Involved in the conflict was one Malus Thorm , who made a catalogue of the dead, with their names, means of death, and possessions. This was recorded in a document kept within Reithwin's House of Healing .</p>
<p>By the 14 th century DR , Ketheric Thorm had risen to become the family's patriarch. He was married to Melodia Thorm and they had a daughter, Isobel Thorm . The family were firm followers of Selûne , with Ketheric converting to the Moonmaiden with his marriage to Melodia. At some point, Ketheric commissioned Morfred to build Moonrise Towers in Selûne's honor. Moonrise Towers even served as the base of the Crescentcoat office of the High Heralds in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, with Naernythra Thaloudyn filling the office circa 1367 DR .</p>
<p>However, Melodia died, leaving a grief-stricken Ketheric to raise Isobel alone, and his condition worsened when Isobel died as well. Lost in his grief, Ketheric renounced the Moonmaiden and turned to Shar , the Lady of Loss. He eventually tricked his daughter's lover, Aylin , into the Shadowfell to become a conduit to fuel Ketheric's immortality.</p>
<p>Ketheric Thorm then led an almost-successful campaign to wipe out Selûnite sympathies or holdouts. In a winter around 1373 DR , the Dark Justiciars under Ketheric fought against the Harpers and the Emerald Enclave and claimed the victory. The Harpers unsuccessfully petitioned for surrender, leading Ketheric to wipe out his enemies while the druids of the Emerald Enclave retreated. Further, a secret deal was struck between Raphael and Morfred, still a Selûnite-in-secret, to wipe out Ketheric's Dark Justiciars. Yurgir and his merregons , employed by Raphael, proceeded to decimate the Dark Justiciars, including Ketheric himself. Before his death, however, Ketheric laid a shadow curse upon the land that persisted long after his death.</p>
<p>Over a century later, Ketheric was brought back from the dead by the god Myrkul to be his general, tasking him with forming an alliance with the other Chosen of the Dead Three and bringing death to the world, offering the resurrection of Isobel as payment. Ketheric accepted, working with the necromancer Balthazar to give Isobel new life. After returning to life, Isobel was frightened by the sight of her "changed" father, fled to the Last Light Inn , and uncovered her father's workings with Shar, Myrkul, and the shadow curse. Unwilling to let his daughter put herself in danger, Ketheric planned to retrieve her, but became preoccupied with establishing Moonrise Towers as the new base of operations for the Cult of the Absolute , as instructed by Myrkul. In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Isobel medt with Jaheira and her Harpers, who were also seeking answers to the sudden emergence of Absolutists.</p>
<p>Already extinct by that time, House Thorm lost Ketheric to a group of adventurers , who had also defeated Malus, Thisobald, and Gerringothe Thorm prior to engaging Myrkul's chosen, leaving Isobel as potentially the last Thorm.</p>
