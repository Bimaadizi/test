<p>Woodtine was a variety of cassiterite .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This brownish and fibrous ornamental stone was found in large nodules and was cut cabochon . The name of this stone was a corruption of the odd term "wood tin", applied colloquially to this gemstone. A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This gemstone could be used as "residual magic" detector, more sensitive than detect magic and other similar spells. When woodtine was brought into contact with another gem , stone, or metal, it would darken in color if that item had been previously enchanted and had since released its magical energies. The color change was temporary and repeatable.</p>
