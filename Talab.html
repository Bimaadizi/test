<p>Talab , also called the City of Questing , was the only inland city within the Pantheist League of interior Zakhara in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Talab lay on the source of Al-Muti River approximately 100 mi (160 km) inland due east of the coast of the Golden Gulf .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Situated at the crossroads between the League of the Pantheon, the Ruined Kingdoms and the Haunted Lands , visitors from very different cultures stopped here, while the inhabitants kept mainly to themselves.</p>
<p>Talab was able to exist and thrive because of a series of ingenious underground conduits tapping a water supply within Al-Sayaj Mountains . This water supply was fiercely protected against any threats.</p>
<p>The caliph of Talab in 1367 DR was Kia al-Sadid .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The so-called City of Questing was both home to a strong slave-trade and an important university specializing in Pantheist religion and medicine.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Talab exported fine fabrics, slaves, and medicine.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The Sword of the True Gods kept 3,000 soldiers and 2,000 cavalry stationed in Talab. Their primary concern was protecting trade and guarding the main pass leading into the Ruined Kingdoms. The city also maintained a watch of 1,000 guards and 100 clerical reserves. The mamluk units of the Parched Mamluk Society , numbering 900 men, guarded the water supply.</p>
