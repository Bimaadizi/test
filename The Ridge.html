<p>The Ridge was a long stretch of cliffs that reached from the eastern Cloud Peaks across northern Amn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Ridge was an exposed elevated fault line nearly 280 feet tall at its center point. The cliffs appeared abruptly out of the surrounding land, and were climbable but challenging. Walking along the Ridge was difficult, as it was a craggy surface and covered with sparse vegetation.</p>
<p>The Ridge was the most extensively mined area in Amn, being rich in minerals, including gems , metals, and salt . Blue-purple diamonds were the most common gem found here, but some even claimed that adamantine could be found in the Ridge.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Ridge extended for more than 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the Cloud Peaks, running east-west alongside the Snakewood and separating Amn from the Greenfields to the north. The Golden Creek and the Vudlur , tributaries of the Splendarrllur , began from the heights of the Ridge.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Ridge had once been covered in forest, but during the Thousand Year War between dragons and giants the trees were burned to the ground and clear-cut, the event known as the First Tethirift that separated the Snakewood from the larger Shantel Othreier . During this period, the heroic elf Tethir died while killing two ancient red dragons who laired in the Ridge, earning his fame as a dragonslayer among elves and dragons.</p>
<p>Gold and iron were first discovered in the Ridge in 575 DR by the Keczull clan, leading to the foundation of the city of Keczulla nearby. Hundreds of years later, in 1355 DR , a simple bookkeeper from Keczulla, Pulth Tanislove , discovered a ruby mine in the Ridge that quickly earned him almost half a million danters . This led him to the founding of Tanislove Mines , the largest mining company in all of Amn . Fortunately for the many miners who worked in the Ridge, the fault was geologically inactive throughout all of Amn 's history.</p>
