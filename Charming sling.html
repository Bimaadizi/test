<p>Charming slings were enchanted slings created sometime before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Charming sling possessed a potent +3 enchantment that improved the damage output and guided its bullets towards the goal. Additionally, these weapons boosted the wielder's charisma.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These slings famously once belonged to exterminators Servan and his sons from the City of Splendors, Waterdeep , some years before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Servan and his progenies "removed" pests from Waterdeep's rich manses and estates. The said pests were varied – from badgers to outlaws. The slings' magic helped them not just to remove undesirable creatures but also to charm the clients with stories of humane treatment of the "pests," spearing nobles, and the wealthy stories of gruesome deaths on their properties. These stories were only half true, as Servan and his sons lured the creatures out only to put them down with well-aimed sling bullets.</p>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR, some of these slings found their way to the city of Neverwinter as well as the merchants of the Crossroad Keep in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR .</p>
