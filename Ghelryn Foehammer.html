<p>Ghelryn "Goldhand" Foehammer was a shield dwarf master smith of the town of Triboar in the Dessarin Valley in the mid-to-late 14 th and late 15 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Ghelryn managed Foehammer's Forge . He was a very skilled blacksmith who produced a large quantity and variety of metalwork items that were sold in shops found all over the North and along the Sword Coast . The quality of his metal and his craftsmanship was above average, and his prices cheaper. In particular, his eyebolts, latches, nails, and pins were crucial to the success of Wainwright's Wagons and other wagon repairmen in town. He also forged quality armor and weapons . His work was recognized by the inlay on the hafts of his weapons. Notably, he forged the darksteel greataxe with telescoping haft that would come to be wielded by Holga Kilgore .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After hearing word of orcs and giants assaults on dwarfholds in the North , Ghelryn often thought about going to fight in the War of the Silver Marches in the Year of the Iron Dwarf's Vengeance, 1485 DR , but he couldn't abandon his business.</p>
<p>By the late 1480s DR, Ghelryn was growing too old for day-to-day work and was in search of an apprentice, but could not find any who met his standards.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he made fine suits of ceremonial armor for King Morinn and Queen Tithmel of Citadel Felbarr and so impressed them he was awarded with the honorary title of Royal Armorer. This strengthened the already strong reputation of Foehammer's Forge, one he intended to uphold.</p>
<p>A year later, he had his chance to fight, when the fire giants Ildmane and Okssort launched a surprise assault on Triboar at highsun with a force of orogs , magmins , and axe beak â€“mounted orcs in an effort to retrieve a piece of the Vonindod , which they'd found buried beneath the caravan campgrounds . Ghelryn Foehammer lent his arm to the defense of the town, together with a band of adventurers . In the aftermath, Ghelryn would give the adventurers a letter of recommendation to the king and queen of Citadel Felbarr, if their journey took them there.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Ghelryn was goodhearted but he zealously hated orcs and giants and he would never run from a fight, especially against them. He believed dwarves must forge their legacy and that he should stand up for Clan Foehammer and for dwarves everywhere.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He maintained a friendly rivalry with fellow smith Aldenar Uldinath , owner of Uldinath's Arms , which was situated across from the road from Foehammer's Forge. This carried on to his granddaughter, Harriet Uldinath .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He fought with breastplate , shield , and battleaxe .</p>
