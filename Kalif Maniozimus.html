<p>Kalif Maniozimus was an administrator of the city of Pazar in the Raurin , and the last administrator to leave the dying city. Before he left, he had a statue erected to himself.</p>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>Before he too abandoned Pazar, Maniozimus ordered a massive statue of himself to be built atop the dome of the Temple of Eilish , which was the highest rooftop left in the city. The statue of Maniozimus had a noble face and carried a tablet against its chest, bearing a message bemoaning the ruin of his city:</p>
<p>Over time, this statue became half-buried in the sands and eroded by time and desert winds, but remained visible for 10 miles (16 kilometers) around Pazar as of 1356 DR . Those who stood too close to the statue while uncovering and reading the tablet were at risk of falling into a sinkhole and ultimately landing in the Temple of Eilish.</p>
