<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1372 DR, Dalia met a shady halfling rogue Burnas Tellrot who told her of the fabled hero of the Peredus the Great ballad. He offered the sailor a deal, she was to descent into the well where the hero was believed to have perished, in the Western Farmlands of Daggerford . She was promised the "treasure o' the gods" for the recovery of Peredus' enchanted blade. Unknowingly to her, Burnas sent Dalia to her death as the cavern under the well was the home of a young black dragon Sulfurus . Dalia managed to sneak past the evil wyrm and found a way out of the cave through a tunnel that lead into the Lizard Marsh . She fought her way through the savage lizardfolk who dwelt in the marsh, and eventually, reached safety of Daggerford.
