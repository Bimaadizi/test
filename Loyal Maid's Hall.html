<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1479Â DR , there were always two Purple Dragons stationed in the Loyal Maid's Hall. In the aftermath of the massacre during the Council of the Dragon in late Mirtul of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the War Wizard Surgol Velard called upon those two soldiers to help him move the mask dancer Amarune Whitewave , whom he had incapacitated with a wand of sleep , believing her too suspicious. Those soldiers returned to their post just in time to miss Storm Silverhand and Mirt .</p>
