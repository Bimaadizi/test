<p>Snarlclaw was a giant troll who was chief of a gang of trolls near Harvestshield Mountain in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>It was hard to motivate Snarlclaw or his gang without either a great deal of food or a great deal of coercion. In battle, Snarlclaw fought out of a desire not to lose rather than out of any drive to win. He was bad at keeping secrets.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Snarlclaw and his gang were in constant conflict with Grocknock and his ettins over territory. In the late 15 th century DR, both groups were forced to serve Mrolgyet's Legion , and their members were branded with the Legion's symbol. On Mrolgyet 's orders to retrieve the Anvil of Dumathoin , Snarlclaw's trolls were forced to dig a tunnel from Harvestshield Mountain into the Frostsilver Mines while Grocknock's ettins broke and extracted their teeth to force them to keep digging. Once inside the Mines, Snarlclaw encountered a group of adventurers in the service of the Open Lord of Waterdeep , Laeral Silverhand . He was badly battered in the fight, but managed to escape and recover.</p>
