<p>A heucuva ( pronounced : / h j uː ˈ k uː v ɑː / hyoo-KOO-va ; pl : heucuva or : heucuvas ), or huecuva , was a powerful type of undead . They were the damned spirits of clerics , druids , monks or paladins who forsook their vows or committed heresies.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Heucuva resembled skeletons in appearance. The main distinguishing feature was that heucuva often wore the tattered robes of their previous life as priests .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Huecuva were corrupted caricatures of their previous lives, spreading disease instead of healing and seeking to kill all those that lived. They possessed only faint memories of their past lives.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Heucuva did not use weapons in combat, instead attacking with their powerful and sharp finger bones. They were strong enough to rip a chunk out of wood in one swipe. If struck, a target was infected with a terrible disease called huecuva blight. This disease was fatal unless a cure disease or a remove disease spell was used to heal the victim. Due to their intense hatred for good-aligned clerics, heucuva ignored all other targets until the cleric was slain.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Heucuva were immune to all spells that influenced the mind and most effects that affected the living. They were also immune to poison . Up to three times daily, heucuva were capable of polymorphing themselves. They used this ability to avoid detection or to ambush a target. Infravision revealed a polymorphed heucuva's true form. Heucuva were skilled in the casting of divine spells, especially those of the Death and Evil domains.</p>
<p>Like other undead, heucuva did not eat or drink. Heucuva did not retain the ability for speech, and instead were reduced to howling and lamented wailing.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<h3>Homelands</h3>
<p>Heucuva were usually encountered in locations with little to no light, such as underground or within crypts. Heucuva preferred warmer climates; they were extremely rare in colder locations. As damned priests, heucuva decorated their lairs to resemble the abbeys and temples they once were a part of, using the corpses of their victims as parishioners. Some heucuva collected treasure from their victims, placing them on a mock alter as offerings. Occasionally, some heucuva did not seek out and settle in lairs, instead roaming the countryside in the dark on a mock pilgrimage.</p>
<p>Beyond the Prime Material plane , huecuva could be found in the Domains of Dread .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Some heucuva acted as servants of the deity Kiaransalee .</p>
<h3>Usages</h3>
<p>Heucuva bones could be ground into a powder and used as a component in the creation of magical items that were used to corrupt spirits or control undead creatures.</p>
