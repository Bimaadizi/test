<p>Angmar Hulmaster , also remembered as Angar Hulmaster , was a ruler of Hulburg in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Angmar's appearance had been likened to "a horse 's posterior."</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>In his youth, Angmar was aimless, bored, and boring. However, he did find amusement in his father's increasing desperation over the plight of the family. He was taciturn in a way that could be mistaken for thoughtful. Later in life, he was known for his heroics and planning.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Through his twenties, Angmar lived with his father, Argyl Hulmaster , and two siblings, Luren and Amali Hulmaster . He eventually married a Thentian woman named Estine , whom he seemed to genuinely care about.</p>
<p>Angmar became one of the most celebrated figures of the Hulmaster family in the decades following his death. He had a son named Lendon , and was the great-grandfather of Geran and Kara Hulmaster .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Angmar grew up in the Hulmaster ancestral home of Hulmaster Keep in the ruins of Hulburg, which had been destroyed in a war with Zhentil Keep in the Year of the Bright Blade, 1347 DR . As the family's fortune began to dwindle, his father began desperately trying to match Angmar and his siblings with potential marriage partners. By the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , his father was becoming increasingly unhinged, and would try to force even vaguely young, attractive, or wealthy individuals into marrying into the Hulmaster family. Angmar would go on to marry Estine, the daughter of a Thentian family which had fallen on similarly hard times as the Hulmasters.</p>
<p>Angmar had become harmach of Hulburg by the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR , when the Red Plumes arrived in Hulburg, having been driven out of Hillsfar . Their leaders, Hekman Odelmor and Kindon Marstel , claimed ownership over any and all treasures hidden within the ruins of Hulburg, and for almost a year they pillaged the area and forced Angmar to provide them with food and drink. On the sixteenth of Ches in the Year of the Bent Blade, 1376 DR , the band forced Angmar to lead them to the crypt of the Hulmaster family beneath Hammerbold Abbey so they could raid the tombs. There, Angmar found the sarcophagus of his ancestor, Rivan Hulmaster , and learned that the family was descended from Aesperus , a powerful lich known as the King in Copper. Angmar made his way to the lich's chambers in the Vault of the Dead , and swore an oath that in exchange for the lich's protection of his family and city, Angmar would wield the laws of Hulburg to make sure that the various crypts and barrows of the surrounding Highfells would remain unspoiled and the sole domain of Aesperus. The lich slew the leaders of the Red Plumes, and Angmar took charge of the remaining mercenaries and their families.</p>
<p>After this, Angmar began rebuilding the city of Hulburg. He built the mighty fortress of Griffonwatch Keep to defend the city, and following the Spellplague of 1385 DR , he decreed the creation of a militia called the Spearmeet , which required that every landowning household field a fully armed soldier, equipped with spear and shield , and that these troops were required to regularly train together. He and his son, Lendon, became known for their efforts to repel orc raiders from Thar .</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, Angar's Square in the heart of rebuilt Hulburg had been named in his honor.</p>
