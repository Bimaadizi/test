<p>Wyrm Wood was the southern edge of the High Forest alongside Athalantar in the 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>When heading from the Horn Hills to Jander , Wyrm Wood was on the left, and one could head north into it, necessarily indicating it was north of Athalantar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Loremasters, 228 DR , Elminster Aumar , the prince of Athalantar turned bandit, was fleeing the Horn Hills for the Woodsedge Inn in winter; he dived into the Wyrm Wood to his left, on the north, after coming across Undarl , one of the Magelords of Athalantar , who was pursuing him. Crossing into the Wyrm Wood, he stepped into a burial glen, where the Magelord pursued; before Undarl could strike him down, some manner of ghost struck the Magelord down. Undarl barely escaped; the ghost pointed the way for Elminster, who soon after made his way to the inn.</p>
<p>According to the innkeeper Broarn of Woodsedge Inn, the Magelords of Athalantar assured the populace they'd fought to kill every last wyrm in the Wyrm Wood and had in fact succeeded twenty years ago.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The armsmen of Athalantar did not believe the wyrms had been truly eliminated.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>A burial glen was known in the area, not far from the treeline close to Jander. The glen was haunted.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Baerithryn mentioned the Magelords of Athalantar had done much dragon-hunting, slaying his fellow dragon-changing mages, almost certainly referring to the Wyrm Wood.</p>
