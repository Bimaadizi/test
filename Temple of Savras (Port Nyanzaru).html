<p>The Temple of Savras in Port Nyanzaru , Chult , was a place of worship dedicated to Savras , the god of diviners , fate , fortune tellers , and wizards .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple lay in Port Nyanzaru's Merchants' Ward atop Temple Hill , and was in fact the namesake of that hill.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The temple was a grand, domed building with a tiled roof designed to resemble an unblinking eye staring up into the sky.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The people of Port Nyanzaru went to the temple to ask for a peek into the future to help them make romantic, business, or other personal decisions, which the priests were happy to provide in exchange for a donation. With a gift of 25 gold pieces or more, the head priest would agree to perform a 24-hour ritual in which they would "consult the guides" to experience a vision relating to the giver's questions. On occasion, this service might be denied to someone with evil intentions.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Unlike many other deities of the Faer√ªnian pantheon , worship of Savras in Port Nyanzaru predated the Spellplague , owing to his clerics ' ability to keep tabs on the threat of the yuan-ti in the jungle.</p>
<p>In the century following the disappearance of Ubtao , Savras became one of the more prominent gods among the people of Port Nyanzaru, notably among those unafraid to speak the truth in the face of opposition. After the city rid itself of its Amnian colonialist rulers, foreign preachers were no longer widely welcome in the city, owing to a history of exploitation, and so the Savrasian priesthood had come to be composed of native Chultans .</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR , the temple was seen as one of the oldest and most impressive buildings still standing in the city. By this time, the priesthood spent little of their time monitoring jungle monsters, and instead were sought out for much more mundane portents.</p>
<p>During the events of the death curse , the Red Wizards of Thay conspired to kill the temple's head priest. They sent bandits to cause a distraction while their assassin attempted to slip inside unnoticed.</p>
