<p>An ikaap was a type of sled used on the Great Glacier .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>An ikaap was a makeshift sled that could be hastily constructed in emergencies. It involved stacking three or four caribou skins on top of each other and saturating them with water. As the water froze, creating a solid platform, two holes were carefully cut near one end of the stack to accommodate a pair of dog reins. A mixture of wet snow and animal hair was formed into a paste and applied to both sides of the stacked skins. Once coated, the entire sled was wetted and left to freeze. With two dogs securely harnessed to the reins, the rider positioned themselves on the frozen skins, and the swift sled was ready for travel.</p>
