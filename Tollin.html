Among those that joined their caravan were Aleema Meddlebrook , Wilfred Brewbanks , William Ray , Rorik , the tiefling Oraphelia Mayne , and an elven girl named Jaena . The trip was somewhat of a disaster, as several members of their group went missing, and Jaena's dog Guen bit a man named Jessup .
