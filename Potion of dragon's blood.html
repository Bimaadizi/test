<p>Potions of dragon's blood were potions imbued with divine magic, used by the clerics of Kelemvor to consecrate shrines.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the Time of Troubles and the apotheosis of the new god of death Kelemvor, many of his new followers set out on a holy mission of claiming shrines and temple of then perished god of death, Myrkul . Part of the consecration ceremony when claiming Myrkul's shrines was using the potions of dragon's blood to cleanse the corruption. The consecration ceremony also broke any enchantments that were placed upon the shrine.</p>
<p>In 1370 DR , a Kelemvorite wandering priest Daland descended to Undermountain on the mission to consecrate the shrines in the temple of Myrkul on the Dungeon Level . While in the temple's crypts, Daland picked up a cursed scroll and became trapped like a living statue. Luckily, soon after, an agent of Khelben Arunsun arrived at the temple in search of the Black Wand of Myrkul . Daland begged for help. He asked the adventurer to use his potion of dragon's blood consecrating the shrine and dispelling the curse.</p>
