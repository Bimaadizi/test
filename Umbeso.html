<p>Umbeso was one of the arcanists from Estagund that accompanied Aniolon Gruanthe in his exodus on the Year of the Slaying Spells, 976 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Umbeso had graying hair.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Umbeso proved to be quite curious, to the point of approaching a dragon and being cautious of their gifts. He was also very decisive.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He had once been one of Aniolon Gruanthe 's rivals in Estagund.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He joined Aniolon's exodus to found the town of Lliiress , looking for a respite from the supremacy of its warrior nobility. When Aniolon Gruanthe secured the help of Gerinvioch , and the dragon in turn employed the Evise Jhontil to create a barrier, Umbeso showed much curiosity about the dragon's exact doings.</p>
<p>The day after that, Umbeso was the first one to publicly figure out the connection between the artifact and the deaths of all who cast a spell in Lliiress. He was quick to propose leaving as a solution, before being informed that there was a barrier; he soon after volunteered to try a wand or other device, employing a brooch of dispelling to try and disable the Evise Jhontil .</p>
<p>Umbeso later witnessed Sohj 's entrapment in a blinking state by the artifact corrupting his teleport spell, and Aniolon Gruanthe's final death, after the mage decided to scry on Gerinvioch.</p>
