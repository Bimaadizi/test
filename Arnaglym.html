<p>Arnaglym was a mage of Arrabar in Chondath some time before the midâ€“14 th century DR and infamous for cruelty and destructiveness.</p>
<p>Arnaglym once hurled a fireball at the wielder of a sword that happened to be occupied by Eldenser , the Worm Who Hides in Blades. Eldenser reflected the fireball back and it ignited vast, old, and very dry tapestries hanging from a huge hammerbeam ceiling under which Arnaglym was standing at the time. The resulting raging fire led to Arnaglym's death.</p>
