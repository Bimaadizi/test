<p>A bag of bones was an enchanted leather pouch that summoned a small army of skeletons .</p>
<p>These magic items were usable only by clerics .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This small pouch contained an assortment of small bones. If the bones were scattered over an area measuring 120 ft (37 m) by 60 ft (18 m), and the proper command word was uttered, a small army of up to 80 skeletons would spring from the ground. The skeletons were armed with swords and would fearlessly obey the commands of the cleric holding the bag. When ordered to fight the skeletons would do so either until destroyed or when the sun set, at which point any remaining skeletons would crumble to dust. The skeleton army could not be split into smaller fighting groups.</p>
<p>The majority of these bags could only be used a single time. However, one third of them could be used repeatedly, replenishing any lost skeletons with each sunset.</p>
<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
