<p>At some point prior to the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , The Joy of Extradimensional Spaces was bequeathed to the fortress library of Candlekeep upon the disappearance of Fistandia, along with the rest of her collection. Fistandia had spent many years researching the Art at Candlekeep, usually in her favorite private study room.</p>
<p>Some time after Fistandia's disappearance, the sage Matreous happened to be assigned her old study room. Through a routine casting of detect magic , he discovered an inactive magical gateway in Fistandia's room. Matreous's further investigations revealed that Fistandia would stay in the study room for weeks at a time, and was rarely seen leaving to eat or sleep. He concluded that Fistandia must have traveled through the gateway somehow. Matreous searched through the books donated by Fistandia until he stumbled upon The Joy of Extradimensional Spaces . He deciphered the command word for the magical gateway and stepped through, but failed to return.</p>
