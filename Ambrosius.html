<p>Ambrosius was a high-ranking paladin of Tyr from Suzail , active in mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ambrosius proudly wore the holy symbol of his deity, announcing his faith and standing within the Church of Tyr .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Ambrosius was an honest Knight of Tyr and loyal subject of the Cormyrian Crown. He did not like spies and subterfuge, even when done on behalf of his king. Unlike many of his fellow paladins, Ambrosius was ready to retreat when dealing with powerful magic or unknown powerful beings.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like other paladins, Ambrosius was able to see through lies. That ability was even further strengthened by the paladin's perceptiveness and keen mind.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1360 DR , Ambrosius was a frequent customer of the Black Rat tavern in Suzail . During the tumultuous time directly preceding the Crusade against the Tuigan Horde, King Azoun Obarskyr IV visited the Rat while discussed as an elderly commoner. The King was there to see the reaction of his subjects to the announced war. There, he met Ambrosius, who was able to see through the disguise, thinking Azoun to be one of the king's spies. During that evening, Ambrosius informed the discussed king that many Cormyrians signed up to be part of the army, the paladin himself included.</p>
<p>After the Crusade's end, in 1362 DR , Ambrosius was still a frequent customer of the Black Rat. He was present in the establishment, eating a humble breakfast, when Artus Cimber and Zintermi were attempting to identify a mysterious amulet Artus recovered from an unnamed ruined keep in the Stonelands . The magic item ended up summoning a four-armed guardian spirit named Skuld . Scared by the magic and sudden appearance of the intimidating creature, all Black Rat clients fled the establishment in fear. Ambrosius left behind his half-eaten breakfast.</p>
