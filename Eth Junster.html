<p>Eth Junster "Stoneclaw" was a male wizard and one of the magelords of Athalantar in the early-to-mid 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>He was young and wore no insignias.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He had a great aptitude for magic, and had devised a spell that gave him umber hulk claws, among others.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In his youth, Eth Junster had slain an umber hulk with magic.</p>
<p>Eth was sent to Narthil in 234 DR to accompany Prince Gartos in slaying Elmara (a disguise of Prince Elminster Aumar ) in response to her attack on Seldinor's apprentices, as the Magelords didn't trust Gartos enough to let him act alone. The mission was also to serve as a test for the promising Gartos, who had proven himself useful thus far. He was killed almost immediately as Elmara spooked his horse and cut him loose from the saddle, making him fall over and hit the back of his head.</p>
