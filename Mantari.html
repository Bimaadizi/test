<p>Mantari were flying creatures that closely resembled manta rays except for the fact that they flew in the air instead of swimming in the seas.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like manta rays they had flat wide bodies, although they were quite smaller than their marine counterparts only being 3 ft (0.91 m) long and 4 feet (1.2 meters) wide. Also unlike manta rays, they had 4 feet (1.2 meters) long tails with stingers on their ends.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>When mantari engaged prey, they would do so by pointing their tail-stinger down and targeting their prey's nervous system. Diving down from 10​ to ​12 feet (3​ to ​3.7 meters), they would attempt to ambush their prey. By attacking the nervous system they were able to near-paralyze unfortunate victims, and once a target lay immobilized the mantaris would begin to feed.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>They usually preyed on giant rats and their like, but would, when driven by hunger, target humans and demihumans alike. They lived in packs and would hunt together, bringing their numbers to bear on larger and more dangerous prey.</p>
<p>Twice a year, they had a mating season whereupon the males would compete in aerial maneuvers to impress the females. They bore two to five young who were born live while the females were in flight, and the parents would be quite protective of their young for the first two months of their lives.</p>
<h3>Habitat</h3>
<p>The mantari were often found in dirty dungeon caverns where their prey abounded. They especially liked to lay still on the cavern floor and hiding until prey were close by, and might be mistaken for puddles of dirty water.</p>
<h3>Training</h3>
<p>A mantari young, if captured within a week of its birth, could be reliably trained and become a loyal pet, guarding and protecting its master, while keeping vermin infestations down. Such trained mantaris often went for as much as 200 gp on the open market.</p>
<h2>Notable Mantari</h2>
<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>Sages were constantly debating whether they were kin to manta rays or related to cloakers , trappers , or lurkers .</p>
