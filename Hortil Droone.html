<p>Hortil Droone was the Magister from 337 DR to 345 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was cruel and quick-witted.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before slaying the previous Magister , he was a mage-for-hire, a veteran warmage. Once the mantle of the Magister passed on to him, he slew a number of rivals, then faked his death and his in a city somewhere in the Shining Sea 's coast, where he posed as a wealthy merchant, "Nelver Kulcharvin", investing in a number of local businesses, including costers and a barrelworks. Through this time he improved his magic, until he finally suspected the Magister had things to do.</p>
<p>His prayers to Mystra were answered by Azuth , who revealed to him that a Magister whose service was good was one who spread magic. In response, Hortil used magic to disguise himself, prepared a cache of scrolls and a scheme to introduce magic to twenty-some apprentices. Then he began to pose as a "Immgar Orlam", a hedge wizard in a traveling carnival, who played with children after each performance; selecting only those who were fascinated more than afraid, he found a number of candidates. Unfortunately, while visiting one of his older apprentices, he was ambushed by the sorceress Phambra Chalyphar , who slew him.</p>
<p>After his death, Hortil Droone wanted to keep teaching, but Mystra refused. Of the possible fates he was offered, he became instead the Royal Crown of Westgate .</p>
