<p>In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , the Zhentarim mage Ghaubhan Szaurr put in motion a plan to join his blood with that of Shandril Shessair in an attempt to gain her spellfire powers, an act strongly implied to be carnal in nature. He was stopped by Manshoon , who slew him and his forces before they could move against Shandril; Manshoon explained he'd found Asklannan's book, strongly implying Asklannan had written the book himself.</p>
