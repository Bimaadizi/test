<p>Mustevals were tiny, mouse-like guardinals native to Elysium and the House of Nature .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mustevals looked like 2‑foot-tall (0.61‑meter) humanoid mice. They were agile and rarely stayed still. When dealing with other creatures they often used their change self ability to appear differently.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Mustevals, like all guardinals, were immune to lightning, resistant to both acid and cold, and could not be petrified. They could speak to any creature that had a language, as if using the spell tongues . Unlike other guardinals, however, they could not speak with animals.</p>
<p>Mustevals also possessed innate magical powers that allowed them to replicate the effects of certain spells. At will, they could replicate the effects of detect evil , detect magic , disguise self , magic missile , and see invisibility ; they could also protect themselves from evil . Once each day, they could turn invisible .</p>
<p>Besides their magical powers, mustevals were small, agile creatures capable of climbing and burrowing. They also had keen hearing.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>If required to fight, mustevals preferred to remain in constant motion and relied on their magic missile -like power. If pressed, they would resort to biting.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Although they were the least powerful variety of guardinal, they used their cunning and small size to help fight evil, often acting as spies and messengers for more powerful celestials . For instance, mustevals were known to serve the goddess Mystra , and some Harper paragons could summon them by means of a powerful summoning spell otherwise forbidden to mortals, for as long as a year at a time.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mustevals were the only guardinal variety who did not have a representative paragon in the Five Companions . They regarded this as a simple oversight that would soon be corrected.</p>
