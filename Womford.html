<p>Womford was a tiny village on the banks of the River Dessarin in the late 15 th century DR . It was formerly known as Ironford , a bridge that crossed the Dessarin. It was a part of the Iron Road .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The ford was once the site of an old wooden bridge, which was later destroyed. Exactly how this happened wasn't well known, but it seemed that a band of adventurers were assaulted by a pack of trolls charging out of the water, and emptied a wand of fireballs into their midst, incinerating the bridge in the process.</p>
<p>A new bridge was constructed at the ford by 1370 DR .</p>
<p>The later settlement of Womford, according to local legend, was to have originally been called "Ironford". The name supposedly changed to "Wyrmford" after a dragon was defeated in the area. Due to the accent of the locals, the pronunciation of Wyrmford was altered, hence the name "Womford".</p>
<p>In 1491 DR , smugglers from Womford allied themselves with the Cult of the Crushing Wave , allowing cultists to get materials and food while setting up a base in Rivergard Keep .</p>
<p>Some time after the War of the Silver Marches of 1485 DR , a nocturnal predator known as "The Womford Bat" hunted near the village, terrorizing the locals. This predator was in fact the vampire Arik Stillmarsh .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>Womford's economy was based on the grain from surrounding farms. The village had several granaries and a gristmill . Womford relied on the river for importing grains from nearby farms.</p>
<p>The dock allowed for the grain and flour to be shipped to other communities along the Dessarin River. There was an under-culture of bandits, smugglers, and river pirates that used the dock for nefarious purposes.</p>
