<p>Drums of deafening were enchanted musical instruments that shattered eardrums when struck.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These kettle drums came in a pair. Each had a diameter of 1 foot and 6 inches (46 centimeters).</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Nothing would happen if only one of the drums was struck. However, if both drums were struck at the same time all living creatures within 70 feet (21 meters) of the drums were permanently deafened . Anything within 10 feet (3 meters) of the drums was also severely stunned. The deafness could be restored if the shattered eardrums were magically healed .</p>
<p>Bards could invoke the magic of each drum separately, striking one to stun nearby creatures and striking the other drum to deafen creatures.</p>
<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
<p>A pair of drums of deafening could be found within the Ring of Venerable Contemplation in Kuo Meilan in the Hordelands .</p>
