<p>Tower Aerilpe was a glass fortress in Sildëyuir . Lord Ilsevele was the master of the fortress back when Kiril Duskmourn was young. Healing could be had in there.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When she returned to Sildëyuir in winter of the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR , it was an elegant tower of pale white stone and glass, ringed with a sturdy granite wall pierced by a mithral gate. The windows and treetops glowed with blue light. A silvered slope lay in the direction of Moonveil Citadel ; the path there crossed a river with a glowing stone bridge. The location had been overrun by weeds, and the corpses of the half dozen guards were still rotting.</p>
