<p>Phastal Street was a minor, corduroy-log paved road located in the Sea Ward of Waterdeep , not far from the Trollwall .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The street ran roughly east-west, beginning at Stormstar's Ride at the west end and terminating at Heroes' Walk —the road that circumnavigated Heroes' Garden —in the east. Along the way, it intersected with the south end of Sanborim Street just before reaching Heroes' Walk.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Eleint of the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , investigations after the fact found that an apprentice wizard attempted a fire spell that got out of control. The apprentice died in the conflagration and several homes, businesses, and villas on Phastal Street were consumed in the blaze as the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors attempted to put out the fire and limit the damage.</p>
<p>Every full moon since the disaster, a spectral image of a woman looking out a window appeared in the air above Phastal Street, a ghostly remnant of a second-story window in a villa that was destroyed in the fire. The woman and the window appeared to be illuminated by the soft glow of a lantern sitting on the sill. The apparition could only be seen when facing it directly from Phastal Street. It was not visible from the side or the back when viewed from Stormstar's Ride.</p>
