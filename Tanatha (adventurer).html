<h2>Activities</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , the traveling writer Volothamp Geddarm visited Halfcrag whilst working on a new guidebook, Volo's Guide to the Dalelands . While there he chatted with a number of the Foray ladies, including Tanatha. She assured the writer that she and her fellow guides were well prepared for any unplanned monster attacks, carrying on any given tour a robe of useful items and a good amount of both elixirs of health and potions of healing .</p>
<p>Volo was surprised at Tanatha's openness with such company details and asked if she wasn't concerned that divulging the existence of these magic items to him would bring any number of thieves harassing Romantic Dreams Forays. With a sly smile she assuaged his concerns, saying that anyone who underestimated the Foray ladies as no more than pretty women in daring armor would be in for a nasty surprise.</p>
