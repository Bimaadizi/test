<p>Darrondar Gweth was head priest of Tempus in Daggerford around 1485 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Darrondar was a soldier in Waterdeep's militia but retired after a skirmish in which most of his company was slaughtered. His life was saved only by the intervention of his friend and fellow Tempus worshiper Alwern Mulverax .</p>
<p>Around 1485 DR, he was visited by Alwern (in truth, the disguised rakshasa Nadir ). He convinced Darrondar to go to Dragonspear Castle to perform a ritual to strengthen the wards on the portal to the Nine Hells . However, when he arrived there, "Alwern" betrayed Darrondar to the vampires of Voltan Szarlnaxi . This supposed betrayal broke Darrondar's spirit and he became the vampires' thrall.</p>
<p>After discovering the disappearance of Darrondar, Sir Isteval deduced most of the truth and hired an adventuring party to rescue the priest.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Darrondar was moved by survivor's guilt and was devoted to honoring the memory of his fallen friends. He had lost his spirit for battle.</p>
