<p>Anth-Malar was the Chosen of Malar and leader of the Furious Hunt lycanthrope cult in the early 1370s DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Though a pure-blooded human , anth-Malar had the aspect of a furry humanoid beast with hooked claws.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Little was known about anth-Malar before he became Malar's Chosen except that he was considered his god's most devout worshiper and laired in the Twisted Run northeast of Silverymoon .</p>
<p>Malar bestowed upon anth-Malar his Chosen status in response to the formation of Luruar , which was seen by the god as civilization encroaching too far upon his beloved wilderness.</p>
<p>Through the actions of a subordinate, Kazok , anth-Malar discovered that blacktooth fungus could be used to intensify the effects of lycanthropy. He planned on using an army of so-called blacktooth lycanthropes to eradicate the settlements of Luruar.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Anth-Malar was devoted to his god, leading many more High Hunts within the Twisted Run than was usual per year. He was sadistic, preferring to impale living victims on the points of stalactites above him.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Anth-Malar wore many defensive magic items to protect him from both physical and magical attacks, but his prize possession was the Skin of Malar , a bloodstained artifact of his god.</p>
