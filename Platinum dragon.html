<p>Platinum dragons were the rarest of metallic dragons ; in fact, most believed that there was only one platinum dragon. They represented the archetype of good-aligned metallic dragons.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Platinum dragons had platinum scales and were huge, even by dragon standards. Their bodies and eyes radiated powerful auras of light, sometimes making onlookers unable to discern the color of their scales. Two of the only three known platinum dragons on Realmspace were wingless wyrms.</p>
<p>A rare few dragonborn sorcerers who drew their magic through their draconic heritage were able to manifest traits of platinum dragons as well.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bahamut was the only platinum dragon known to most non-dragon scholars, and they believed he was a unique type of dragon. Even so, those scholars were wrong about thisâ€”Bahamut was actually unique among his kind for the fact that he had wings (although it was once said that Bahamut was a wingless dragon as well).</p>
<h2>Known Platinum Dragons</h2>
<p>All known platinum dragons were members of the Draconic pantheon .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>King Strohm IV of Tethyr was said to have been protected by a platinum dragon, but who this dragon was is lost to history.</p>
