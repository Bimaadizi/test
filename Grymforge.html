<p>Grymforge was the name given to a fortress in the Underdark that was connected to a nearby Sharran temple called the Gauntlet of Shar . In the late 15 th century DR , Grymforge was nearly forgotten and had no permanent inhabitants except those trying to explore its secrets.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Grymforge was built on the shore of a lava lake that was used to heat the fortress's forge and later the Adamantine Forge.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>First Sharran period</h3>
<p>The original fortress was built by unknown followers of the goddess Shar . It had another name at the time, which was still known by the late 14 th century and was mentioned in the book Grymforge: A History , but by the 1490s DR this word was illegible. A forge was built around the lava lake bordering the city.</p>
<p>The Sharrans had been using the fortress for almost 800 years, but for some reason it was abandoned. The reason for that was a mystery even for Shar's Chosen , Ketheric Thorm .</p>
<h3>Second Sharran period</h3>
<p>In the later 14 th century Ketheric Thorm planned to rebuild "the lost city". It served as the headquarters of Ketheric's Dark Justiciars .</p>
<p>The Sharran priestess Sister Ansar converted the gnome Silouv Yali (probably via torture) to the Sharran faith. Silouv was known from Candlekeep to Sorcere for his talents in wizardry and metallurgy and he redesigned the fortress's forge so it could smelt ore to produce adamantine for making weapons. After a sequence of experiments, he managed to find a way to put this idea into practice. The true treasure of Grymforge was not its Adamantine Forge, but the adamantine golem called Grym guarding it – a creation born of molten magma and potent magic.</p>
<p>However, the enemies of the Sharrans tried to infiltrate the fortress, leading to a series of misidentifications of fellow Sharrans as spies by inquisitor Sybil . At least one of the Harper spies was captured and interrogated, revealing one of their trapped stashes.</p>
<p>The Dark Justiciar forces of the fortress prepared an assault against Moonhaven and the traces of these preparations could still be found in Grymforge as of 1492 DR. The correspondence between inquisitor Sybil and General Ketheric Thorm testified to the changes in the assault plans as Sybil's subordinates hadn't destroyed Moonhaven by the time planned by Ketheric. It resulted in Ketheric deciding to lead the Dark Justiciars against the Selûnite town himself a tenday after his planned visit to Grymforge.</p>
<p>The Selûnites in Reithwin were on the verge of being destroyed, so Mordfred , the leader of the Selûnite resistance , made a deal with the cambion Raphael , selling his soul in exchange for help fighting against Ketheric's Dark Justiciars. Raphael sent the orthon Yurgir to get rid of the Sharrans. The orthon broke through the walls of Grymforge and started to exterminate all the Dark Justiciars of Grymforge and the Gauntlet of Shar until there were none left. Some of his merregons still roamed the Inquisitor's chambers as of 1492 DR.</p>
<h3>Bitterroot Clan period</h3>
<p>In the late 15 th century, Grymforge was held by the duergar Clan Bitterroot and ruled by king Guerdon . The presence of the clan threatened the plans of the Cult of the Absolute . According to the report of disciple Z'rell called Beheading the Bitterroots , the cult decided to assassinate king Guerdon, thus causing a succession crisis within the clan. The next step would be taking the shattered duergar under the cult's control. By the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Bitterroot Clan was destroyed and the ruined city got new masters.</p>
<h3>The Absolute Crisis</h3>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the fortress was under the control of the cultists of the Absolute that operated under the orders of True Soul Nere , supported by duergar mercenaries of Clan Flameshade , which may have split from Clan Bitterroot. The cultists were trying to find a passage to the Gauntlet of Shar. For this task, they required a larger workforce, so they assigned Clan Flameshade to deliver slaves to excavate the fortress. Most of them were enslaved after a successful assault on the so-called Decrepit Village , a deep gnome settlement on the other side of Ebonlake. Many slaves died and were simply thrown into the waters of the lake.</p>
<p>A squad of drow Harpers under the leadership of Jhaam , acting on Jaheira 's orders, attempted to infiltrate the cultists, but their real identities were revealed and they were publicly hanged by a novice of the Absolute called Murmath .</p>
<p>The route from Grymforge to the Gauntlet of Shar turned out to be impassable and during the excavation the ceiling had collapsed. Nere and four enslaved deep gnomes were caught in a gas trap trying to reach a broken platform leading to the Temple.</p>
