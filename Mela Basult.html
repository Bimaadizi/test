<p>Mela Basult was a female Chondathan human in the town of Wheloon in Cormyr in the 1370s DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Mela was the wife of Amnic Basult , the proprietor of Basult's Books . The two were heard to have loud arguments, but Mela firmly believed her husband still loved her.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Early in the month of Eleint in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Amnic went missing. Mela was distraught and sought someone to help, but the militia of the Wheloon Watch did not investigate such cases. Neighbors, meanwhile, rumored Amnic had left his wife, either taking a few days away or taking up with another woman. Mela, meanwhile, tried to manage the bookshop in Amnic's absence.</p>
<p>Eventually, on Eleint 6 , adventurers discovered that the new Temple of Mystra in town was actually a front for priests of Shar and Cyric to kidnap magic-users and spirit them away to the Vast Swamp for some nefarious purpose. Investigators found Amnic's body along with two others in a torture chamber beneath the false temple, identified by his possessions. To quell his suspicions, the false priests or their agents had evidently kidnapped Amnic. Not a magic-user himself, Amnic had been tortured to death on a rack by Deinyn Fembrys . Mela was informed of her husband's fate.</p>
