<p>Thasmudyan was an evil god of the undead and undeath, and a baatezu lord, worshiped since time immemorial on the Zakharan island of Sahu .</p>
<h2>Cult of Worms</h2>
<p>Thasmudyan's followers called themselves the Cult of Worms and were led by his Chosen and high priestess, the lich Vermissa , from her long-time magical prison on Sahu. In the early 1400s DR, members of the cult secretly spread throughout many nearby lands, trying to get into positions of power.</p>
<h2>Places of worship</h2>
<p>The Garden of Eternity , an enormous cave deep within the Vishap's Spine mountains of Sahu, contained a palace with a huge chamber dedicated as a cathedral to Thasmudyan.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The original worshipers of Thasmudyan were the inhabitants of the strange, mushroom-shaped metal towers found on the shores of Sahu and in Rog'osto . Their origin was a mystery to most in 1367 DR , but they were actually built by a civilization of the sea-dwelling locathah . In a war these areas were magically raised from the waters, forcing the locathah to abandon them.</p>
<p>Emigrants from the Geomancer 's empire of Kadar found the remnants of Thasmudyan's cult on Sahu and revived it. When the cult's leader Vermissa was imprisoned and lost from sight after a conflict with Necromancer King Uruk , the worship of the King of Worms dwindled in importance.</p>
<p>After the fall of the dynasty of Necromancer Kings and general decline of civilization on Sahu, the Cult of Worms transformed into a secret society, with the goal to first and foremost free Vermissa as was prophesied in the Nycoptic Manuscripts .</p>
