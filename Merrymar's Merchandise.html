<p>Merrymar's Merchandise was the only general store in the halfling village of Shining Falls in the Delimbiyr Vale in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . It was owned by the local merchant Blaz Merrymar .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The building was low and long. It was marked by a placard displaying Blaz's smiling face.</p>
<h2>Staff</h2>
<p>The store was owned by Blaz Merrymar, but its day-to-day running was handled by his wife Rinyon and their children. Blaz procured goods for the store, at least when he was not engaging in get-rich-quick schemes.</p>
<p>Blaz had exclusive deals with all the crafters in the village so that only he could sell their wares to outsiders. Fortunately, his good judge of character, reasonable commissions from fellow halflings, and fair prices for customers made this monopoly profitable for all.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the summer of Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , goods meant for Merrymar's Merchandise were raided on the road by bandits, thought to be orcs of the High Forest . Tragically, Blaz and Rinyon lost not only merchandise but also all four of their sons and three nephews, leaving the extended family decimated and the store understaffed.</p>
