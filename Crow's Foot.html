<p>Crow's Foot was a hamlet at the foot of the city of Ravens Bluff , on the eastern shores of the Dragon Reach .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The hamlet was situated outside of the protective stone walls of the city, west of its Foreign District . The only road that connected it to the city was the Front .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Most of the buildings in the hamlet were built in an architectural style known on some worlds as " Tudor ". Many were built of stucco , some simple stone, and thatched roofs were quite prominent. Narrow cart paths passed for streets in the hamlet and no torches were set out to illuminate them during the night. During the evening one could see the light of hearthfires and candles from the many windows of residents.</p>
<p>It was not uncommon to hear conch shells being blown during the night, either as a religious act towards Istishia during nights when the Veil was up or out of a local belief that doing so would ward off monsters.</p>
<h2>Law & Order</h2>
<p>The City Watch and Night Watch of Ravens Bluff oversaw the hamlet's law enforcement, though things were usually quite peaceful in Crow's Foot.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On a foggy night around the spring or fall season of the Year of the Harp, 1355 DR , a group of newly minted Night Watchmen patrolled the hamlet and had a myriad of encounters. First they saved a middle-aged woman, who was on her to slop the two pigs she kept in her backyard, from three mangy dogs . They then met the vampire hunter Jack Harkness and accompanied him to the Red Sail Inn, where they ran off four human hooligans that were posing as members of the Night Watch in an effort to shake the tavernkeep down for protection money. As they tried to leave Crow's Foot to patrol Old Town they investigated a fireball and tremendous pyrotechnic display in the nightsky that were the cause of two wizards , Modo and Yvas , arguing over which of them had cast the spell that slayed a blue dragon back in their adventuring days.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , a group of fire worshipers emerged in Crow's Foot called the Cult of Red Ruin and established a temple close to the Red Sail Inn . Sometime later that year the cult found and trapped within an iron flask a pyre elemental . Over the next two weeks the cultists caused several fires in Ravens Bluff, until one day they caused a significant wave of fires in Crow's Foot, Old Town, and the Warehouse District .</p>
