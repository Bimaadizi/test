<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Thurlow and his cousin Tudor devised a plan to cheat at the highly guarded gambling establishment called The Track . The dog track and bar thoroughly searched all who entered for any items that could affect a racing hound's performance, such as potions of haste . But Thurlow concocted something he called a simple mixture of spices that could be smuggled past the Track's bouncers. The gnome spotted a group of well-armed adventurers on the street and chased them down to hire for the simple task of bringing the vial of spices to his brother Tudor Fezziwink.</p>
