<p>The Goblin Marches was a narrow region north of Cormyr and the Storm Horns , south of Anauroch the Great Desert, west of the Stonelands , and stretching toward the Sunset Mountains in the west. It was populated by roving bands of goblinoid raiders.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Goblin Marches was a desolate wasteland of crags, bogs, drumlins (elongated hills), and thorny thickets, as well as open plains and caves. South of the Marches, along the northern edge of the Storm Horns, were the Farsea Marshes and the High Moors (not to be confused with the High Moor ).</p>
<p>The stony infertile soil of the Marches was unsuited for farming, and the climate was hot and humid in summer, and cold and windy in winter. The region was mostly rough grassland with sparse vegetation, small streams, rocky outcroppings, and isolated copses of gnarled trees. Caves and tunnels were carved into the bedrock by underground streams and pools. These caves provided lairs for many of the inhabitants.</p>
<p>There were few plants despite the abundant rain and ground water, with the exception of hardy grasses, flowering weeds, prickly ground vines, and various types of fungus. Low scrub brush was found throughout the plains.</p>
<h2>Fauna</h2>
<p>In ancient times, the region that became the Goblin Marches was green and teeming with wildlife. However, the rise of human empires with powerful magic, such as Netheril , disrupted the balance of natural predators and prey. The introduction of monstrous predators, including dragons and chimeras , caused further disruption.</p>
<p>As the goblinoid population increased, their wasteful overhunting contributed to the near-depletion of many species of game animals. These humanoid predators then turned on each other while they themselves became the prey of larger monsters. Those creatures that survived included the giant forms of normal animals, as well as dinosaurs , while smaller predators such as wolves and bears moved out of the area for less severe competition.</p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>Ruined castles and dead ancient cities were found throughout the Marches. These were the remnants of goblin fortresses dating back to the days of their great nation. Many of these ruins became the lairs of monsters, and most had been plundered of their treasures but still continued to attract hopeful adventurers. The goblins later made their lairs in cave and tunnel complexes while the orcs lived in villages and kobolds made their homes in deep subterranean caverns.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Cormyr laid claim to the Marches (and the Stonelands) but was never able to control them. The goblinoids themselves were disorganized and most tribes were not much stronger than the others.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The Zhentarim maintained a trade route through the Marches, which inevitably led to frequent interaction with the goblinoid tribes, often hostile but not always. The Zhentarim attempted to recruit them on a long-term basis as an army, but the disorganized nature of the tribes and the threat posed by the Cormyrean military prevented this from happening.</p>
<p>They also endeavored to exert the same influence over the Border Raiders of the Stonelands. One of the tactics employed by the Zhentarim for these purposes was to install mind-controlled dopplegangers in positions of leadership among the goblinoids.</p>
<p>Direction for Zhentarim activity within the Marches came from Darkhold and Dagger Falls .</p>
<p>The orcs of the Marches were excellent miners and owned a number of iron mines. They used this iron to make weapons, armor, and tools but were never known to trade it to other races.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The Cormyrean strongholds of High Horn and Castle Crag , located in the Storm Horns, kept the goblinoid tribes confined within the Marches.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The goblinoid races and their allies ruled this area as a powerful nation more than a thousand years ago, making extensive raids as far away as Suzail , Asram , and Anauria . The goblins were finally defeated not in war, but by the gradual and unstoppable expansion of Anauroch the Great Desert, against which they were powerless. Croplands were destroyed, the nation fell, and the tribes were scattered. They afterward established minor power bases in the Goblin Marches, the High Moors , and the mines of Tethyamar , which had been taken from the dwarves .</p>
<p>The earlier goblin nation was ruled by Hlundadim , or Great Hlundadim to the goblins, a being of great magical power from another plane about whom little is known. During this time the goblins were based in a great fortress in the center of the Marches called Araugul , or Goblin Mount, but they had other strongholds as well. With the encroachment of the Great Desert, Hlundadim disappeared and the goblins abandoned their strongholds.</p>
<p>In a later attempt to regain their former glory, the goblinoids made war against the western lands but were defeated at the Battle of Bones .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The region was home to various humanoid races including orcs , goblins , hobgoblins , kobolds , gnolls , bugbears , ogres , and orogs (orc/ogre crossbreeds). They raided the few Cormyrean settlements that existed there, but they also raided each other with equal compunction. Travel to and from the Marches was difficult and most Cormyreans chose not to settle in that dangerous land.</p>
<p>The raiders also attacked trade routes in the Storm Horns and made occasional forays into the Farsea Marshes against settlements of humans known as Marsh Drovers . These marsh raids usually ended in disaster for the attackers as they would get lost in the unfamiliar terrain or were cut down by the swamp's monstrous inhabitants including trolls , tribes of bullywugs , and worse. It was theorized that the Marsh Drovers once lived in the Goblin Marches but were driven into the marsh by the goblinoids and the region's changing climate.</p>
