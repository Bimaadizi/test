<p>A block and tackle was a set of ropes and pulleys that enabled a user to vertically lift objects heavier than their strength would normally be capable of lifting.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A block and tackle typically consisted of a set of square, wooden blocks with greased internal wheels. These blocks were attached to something, such as a wall or tree branch, by multiple straps and harnesses in order to securely suspend it above the desired object. Finally, a rope, typically 50 feet (15 meters) in length, was then threaded through these series of internal wheels and then a hook that attached to the desired object.</p>
<p>A block and tackle was commonly sold in three different weight classes. A light version was capable of lifting objects less than 200 pounds (91 kilograms), a medium version was capable of lifting objects up to 1,000 pounds (450 kilograms), and a heavy version was capable of lifting objects up to 5,000 pounds (2,300 kilograms) in weight.</p>
