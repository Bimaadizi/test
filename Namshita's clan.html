<p>Namshita's clan was one of the clans of the nation of Tymanther . Unlike the other Thymari clans, Namshita's was composed of Mulani instead of dragonborn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As a reward for their help during the first Tymanther-Unther War , in 1487 DR Vanquisher Kallan allowed Namshita and her followers, all of them Mulani refugees that had fled from Unther , to assemble their own clan, giving them full rights as citizens of Tymanther. The decision was unpopular among the old-fashioned clans, but was supported by other clans, among them those that were grateful for Namshita's role in the liberation of their clan members that had being enslaved by Gilgeam after the return of Unther to Toril.</p>
<p>As of Hammer of 1487 DR , the official name of the clan, as well as their distinctive clan piercings, were yet to be decided.</p>
