<p>Gaustar's Creek was a long, swift-flowing stream in the Dessarin Valley and a tributary of the River Dessarin .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Gaustar's Creek began somewhere between the Sumber Hills and the High Forest . It meandered generally southwest, eventually cutting a deep gorge in the relatively soft bedrock as it passed by the Forlorn Hills . It was crossed by the Iron Road and emptied into the Dessarin not far from Goldenfields . By some estimates, the creek was about 60 miles (97 kilometers) long.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The stream was named after Gaustar Jadehammer , a dwarven clan chief that led his people south as they fled from orcs . It was said that he buried the clan's wealth—a large chest of gems —somewhere on the banks of this creek in the Year of the Sunset Winds, 1309 DR , before the last member of Clan Jadehammer fell. As of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , no such chest had been found.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Various creatures made their homes by digging out small caves or tunnels in the walls of the gorge eroded by Gaustar's Creek. A large colony of stirges were known to prowl the area for as long as anyone could remember.</p>
