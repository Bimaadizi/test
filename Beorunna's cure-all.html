<p>Beorunna's cure-all was the name of a plant found in the Savage Frontier . Considered a herb , it was noted for its healing properties as a supplement.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>When its stems were boiled in a tea , drinking the resulting concoction would have a general restorative effect, but only when combined with another attempt to relieve a malady, be it wound or disease. The addition of Beorunna's cure-all would enhance the effect of any treatment, mundane or magical, to make cuts heal better and defeat illnesses faster. However, the plant had no inherent power to heal, it merely aided another form of treatment and the tea would provide no effect if drunk on its own.</p>
