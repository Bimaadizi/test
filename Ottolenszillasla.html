<p>Ottolenszillasla , or Otto for short, was a violet faerie dragon living in Maddgoth's Castle in Undermountain in the 14 th and 15 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1483 DR , Otto was drawn into Undermountain by Halaster Blackcloak 's magic, together with a stone giant clan. He enjoyed his new home, especially Maddgoth's Castle, whose magic did not affect the dragon. So Otto decided to settle there playing with the stone giants.</p>
<p>By 1492 DR , Otto was growing tired of the presence of Maddgoth 's homunculus and started make plans to remove it.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Otto was a typical faerie dragon. He considered himself the new master of the castle under the premise "I found it so it is mine" and disliked the homunculus's opposition.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>When bored, Otto played pranks on the nearby stone giants or fought with Maddgoth's homunculus as it annoyed him.</p>
