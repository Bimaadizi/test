<p>A speaking horn , also called a speaking-tube , was a cone held to the mouth to project a bard or other orator's voice.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A speaking horn could be made of polished wood or leather . Leather horns were reinforced with iron hoops and could be disassembled for easier storing. Aurora's Emporium sold speaking horns of birchwood for 3 gold pieces and leather ones for 5.</p>
<p>When the average speaker held the horn to their mouth, it could help project the voice so that listeners up to 100 yards (91 meters) away could hear. Speakers with greater stamina for speaking could project their voices even farther. The sound could be heard in a 60-degree arc around the front of the speaker.</p>
<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
<p>Earl Ravenak and Tobiworth Hedgeblossom , two rabble-rousers from Zazesspur , each possessed speaking-tubes, which they used in their speeches.</p>
