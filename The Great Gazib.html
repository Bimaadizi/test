<p>The Great Gazib was a traveling circus mage who put on The Great Gazib Show in the Carnival outside of Nashkel during the iron crisis of 1368 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the year 1368 DR, he partnered himself with an ogre called The Amazing Oompah whom he would magically appear to make explode in front of a live audience. This alliance got out of hand when The Amazing Oompah was asked to do too many live shows in one day and attacked a spectator, perishing in the attempt. The Great Gazib ran and was never seen again.</p>
