<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Pirates familiar with the area usually avoided Telfar on nights where a full moon rose as entire ships were known to disappear here. Many speculated about the sinister causes of these disappearances, ranging from lycanthropes to giant sea monsters, but the truth was a purely scientific one. The natural shape of Telfar's harbor caused water to rush out during the tidal change of the full moon, creating a large whirlpool capable of engulfing any nearby ships.</p>
