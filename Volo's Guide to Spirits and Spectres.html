<p>Volo's Guide to Spirits and Spectres was a manuscript penned by Volothamp Geddarm , available in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>In its unfinished state, the book was nothing more than a barely-legible draft that focused on spirits (the alcohol kind). Some of the items listed in the book were: ghost , banshee , poltergeist , and "spooky". All were, presumably, recipes of alcoholic drinks. One of these libations called for a full mug of ice, half a mug of distilled potato spirits, and three thimbles of citrus juice . The drink was served with a garnish of mint .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , this work was still an early manuscript, carried by its author, Volothamp Geddarm, during his venture to the Western Heartlands and investigation of the Cult of the Absolute .</p>
