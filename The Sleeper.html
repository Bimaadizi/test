<p>The Sleeper was a female tarrasque and one of the nyama-nummo , the offspring of the deity Olurobo in ancient Katashaka .</p>
<p>Believed to be the greatest of the nyama-nummo , the Sleeper dwelled in the Palace of the Alliz-Dren. She reigned over the lands of the Tabaxi tribe of humans and supposedly favored them over the other tribes. In turn, they chose one of their own at birth to be named Tarasajok , meaning "She Who Watches over the Sleeper"—and who had the honor of being first to be eaten by her upon awakening on the next Night of Feasting.</p>
<p>In Tabaxi legend, one season, the Sleeper desired vengeance against an ancient enemy and summoned the greatest warriors of the nine tribes to follow her into battle in Mhairshaulk (c. −34,800 DR to c. −24,000 DR ). Apparently defeated, the Sleeper returned in a rage, went on a rampage, and devoured four other nyama-nummo on the Night of Feasting, before finally returning to sleep and recuperate in the Palace of Alliz-Dren. She would awaken twenty-three more times, and ever more angry and hungry.</p>
<p>Finally, on the next Night of Feasting at the end of a millennium, before −2809 DR , the current Tarasajok , Oyai was blessed by Ubtao and empowered with magic. This was right before the Sleeper awoke with a roar and came to devour her. But she used the magic to halt, crush, and slay the Sleeper. That night, many liberated and joyous Tabaxi pledged themselves to Ubtao and thereafter journeyed across the sea to Chult .</p>
