<p>The arquebus , also known as a hackbut , was a type of firearm .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>An arquebus consisted of a wooden stock and a metal, smooth bore barrel, which often had a hook-like projection on the underside. Where some firearms had a trigger, arquebuses had a curved piece of metal called the "serpentine". This was known as a matchlock firing mechanism.</p>
<p>Arquebuses that came from Lantan typically had the symbol of Gond stamped on the butt of their stock.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>An arquebus required both hands to fire, with arms absorbing the recoil, and unlike a musket they didn't require a stand to support their barrel. They were also sturdy enough to be wielded like a club , but they could be damaged in the process.</p>
<p>Arquebuses were loaded by pouring smokepowder from a powderhorn into the muzzle, firmly packing it with a piece of paper, and then ramming in the projectile (an iron ball). Once the barrel was loaded a user needed to fill the firearm's priming pan with smokepowder, close it, and place a burning slow-match within the serpentine. Putting pressure on a metal plate would then release the serpentine into the pan, thereby firing the weapon.</p>
<p>If an arquebus ever backfired it was fouled and couldn't be used further until it was cleaned, a process that could take at least thirty minutes.</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On the world of Toril , the arquebus originated on the island nation of Lantan, during the Time of Troubles , after the deity Gond revealed to his followers how to make reasonably safe and accurate firearms that utilized smokepowder. From 1358 DR onwards, the Lantanna priests of Gond (mainly the specialty priests ) would work to spread the use of firearms, shipping them to Western ports.</p>
<p>When arquebuses first showed up off of Lantan they were considered mere curios, but after five or so years they became increasingly common. Their increasing prevalence on Toril was due in part to spelljammers bringing in arquebuses from elsewhere. With one source being the Smiths' Coster trading company, who conducted business with the Lantanna, Waterdhavians , and elsewhere.</p>
<p>By 1370 DR , one could purchase arquebuses among other firearms from The Brigadier , a giff gunsmith, in Skullport .</p>
<h2>Price</h2>
<p>In the first three years that it was available for purchase outside of Lantan, an arquebus cost roughly 5,000 gold pieces . Through the third to fifth year, as the weapon became more common, the cost lowered to 1,000 gold pieces. Following the fifth year, an arquebus on Toril consistently cost around 500 gold pieces.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Arquebuses were thought by some to be as dangerous to their user as they were their target.</p>
