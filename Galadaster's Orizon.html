<p>Galadaster's Orizon was a spellbook written by the feared lich Galadaster .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>With its circular electrum cover, the Orizon resembled a large coin approximately four handwidths across. It had six pages of vellum stretched over whistlecane frames and bound by a spiral of wire. Each page held a spell with instructions and runes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Living in an isolated tower in what would become Amn , Galadaster undertook many adventures, returning to his tower with the treasures and valuable items he found. If he encountered a fellow mage on his travels, he often slew the mage and stole his magical possessions and spellbooks. His Orizon was a workbook which he compiled early in his travels, and later, he would regard it as a lesser work.</p>
<p>After many years, wizards in the surrounding area became fearful and jealous of the power Galadaster held, and one day undertook a raid on his tower, seeking to destroy Galadaster and plunder his tower. By this point, Galadaster had transformed himself into a lich . After defeating his many traps and guardian creatures, the wizards finally encountered Galadaster. The ensuing battle was quite one-sided, and the wizards, in their desperation, launched a powerful final attack on the lich. The result not only destroyed the tower but killed the wizards themselves. Surviving the attack, Galadaster left the area, departing to the Nelanther Isles . The only item that survived the attack was the Orizon .</p>
<p>By around 1267 DR , the spellbook had come into the possession of the archmage Ilthong of Crimmor , and its contents were chronicled by an apprentice named Thelonn Bedelzar in his Bibliamagus . It was subsequently stolen and its location remained unknown through the mid-1300s DR .</p>
<p>In the late 1490s DR , the corpse of the Uthgardt Elk tribe warrior Ven Salafin , slain at the Battle of the Evermoors circa 1400 DR and briefly revived via speak with dead , considered Galadaster's Orizon when asked by Edgin Darvis what his favorite book was, but he couldn't decide.</p>
