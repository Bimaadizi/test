<p>Plate mail of etherealness was a type of enchanted plate armor that allowed the user to become ethereal as if an oil of etherealness , or the etherealness spell , had been applied.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Two types of this armor existed, one which gave a constant edge in defensiveness in combat, and one which reduced its defensiveness as the user repeatedly entered the ethereal state.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The constant version of this armor could either give the wearer an edge in defense or let them become ethereal, in which case only spells like phase door could undo the power apart from the choices of the wearer. 49 times one could become ethereal, then the armor was 'merely' an enchanted plate mail. The other type were more defensive in the beginning, but for every 5 times one entered the ethereal state, it would lose part of its protective ability. After 20 uses this armor too was spent, but in addition it's enchantment had nearly worn off, and only a fifth of its originally defensive protection remained. The two types had the same price and until use were indistinguishable.</p>
