<p>The Mtair Dhafir was a nomadic tribe of the Bedine people that traveled between the oases of the Sword in the Anauroch desert.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Like other tribes of the Bedine, the Mtair Dhafir were led by a single sheikh. As of the early 1360s DR , the Mtair Dhafir were led by Sheikh Sabkhat .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Mtair were known to stay at the oasis of El Ma'ra , among others.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , the Mtair Dhafir formed an alliance with the Qahtan tribe, through the marriage of the sheikhs' children. The outcast sorceress Ruha , daughter of Mtair sheikh Sabkhat, wed the brave Qahtani warrior Ajaman .</p>
<p>Mere days later, Sheikh Sabkhat entered into negotiations with the impressive warrior Zarud , an agent of the Zhentarim that sought to subjugate the Bedine and open a trade route through their lands. Unbeknownst to the sheikh, he was being manipulated by the spellcaster Yhekal and forced to act against his will. Thanks to the efforts of Ruha talking sense into her father, the insight of the brave warrior Al'Aif , and the intervention by the outlander agent of the Harpers known as Lander , the Mtair were able to eliminate Zarud, and avoid entering into an alliance with the Zhentarim.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the Zhentarim army and their asabi mercenaries quickly marched upon the Mtair camp at El Ma'ra. The tribe was all but eradicated by the invading forces, and their bodies were fed to the reptilian asabis.</p>
