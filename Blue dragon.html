<p>Blue dragons , referred to by sages as draco electricus and also known as storm dragons , were a breed of chromatic true dragon . Their breath weapon was a line of lightning or a large electrical discharge.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Blue dragons were physically distinguished by the single large horn protruding from their heads and also by their ears, which were rather large and frilled. The neck was short and broad. The tail was thick and flat. They smelled like electricity or sand.</p>
<p>A dragon egg could be identified as belonging to a blue by the web of thin blue lines seen when held in front of an intense white light.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>They were orderly creatures and were unusual for chromatic dragons in that they maintained fairly well-ordered, hierarchical societies.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>They were also extremely adept at burrowing in sand, and often lie in wait just below the surface of the desert for prey. When they were so burrowed, their large horns could easily be mistaken for pointed desert rocks.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Blue dragons used a shocking burst of lightning.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<h3>Lairs</h3>
<p>Blue dragons were native to arid wastelands and deserts. They made their lairs in underground caves; easily accessible to the dragons, as they could burrow through the ground. These dragons would fly above their territory, using the bleak landscape and its sparse terrain features as their best chance of spotting opponents.</p>
<h3>Reproduction</h3>
<p>Despite their evil nature, blue dragons were actually excellent parents to their young, and would rarely leave their eggs unattended.</p>
