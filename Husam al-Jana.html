<h2>History</h2>
<p>Years before, an adventurer named Husam bin Waleed came to the Grand Caliph with a proposal: he would bring the Grand Caliph one of the famed winged cats ( jana-nimr ) if he would be allowed to marry a woman from the Royal Harim. Intrigued, Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir brought Husam to view the women of his harem. An elven beauty named Halima stood out above the rest, and Husam selected her. Khalil agreed to the bargain and Husam left in search of the jana-nimar. After finally locating a group of the elusive cats, Husam was accosted by a much larger jana-nimar, who actually spoke to him. Husam tried to lie his way out of the situation but the large cat saw right through the deceit and transformed Husam into a winged cat.</p>
<p>Husam eventually returned to the Royal Harim. Khalil was pleased because he believed he was finally in possession of a rare jana-nimar. Halima recognized that the cat had the same exact earring that Husam wore. Khalil realized what happened and was pleased because he got what he wanted without having to break his word. Husam remained close with Halima every day after that.</p>
