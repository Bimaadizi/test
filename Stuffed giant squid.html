<p>Stuffed giant squid was a specialty dish found in the town of Tulmene in Tethyr in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Despite any presumptions one might make from the dish's name, the giant squid itself was actually an inedible hard brown shell. However, its stuffing was the star of the dish. The giant squid shell was filled to the brim with a variety of crabs , several types of smoked fish , whole onions , limes , minced pork , and well-spiced brown sauces. The aromatic dish's size was indeed impressiveâ€”the platter it came on was as long as a short human .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The best way to taste the impressive stuffed giant squid was special-ordering it from Tulmene's Tower inn and its cook Julda in the 1360s DR. The special dish was for special occasions and truly impressed Volothamp Geddarm , enough for him to give Tulmene's Tower his highest ratings in the guide to Amn and Tethyr he penned.</p>
