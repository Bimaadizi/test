<p>Harvest of Memory was a book that collected knowledge on the topic of Shadar-kai and their mistress, the Raven Queen of the Shadowfell . It was published in or before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>Harvest of Memory stated that the realm of Shadowfell was a dark, twisted, and wicked reflection of the Prime Material plane , filled with sadness and despair. That was where the Raven Queen brought her Shadar-kai elves . These elves were different from the Fair Folk who inhabited the Sword Coast as the Shadar-kai themselves were a reflection of the Shadowfell in physiology and attitude. The tome described them as cruel and evil, thoroughly dedicated to the Raven Queen.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
