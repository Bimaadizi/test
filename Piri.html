<p>Piri was a drow wizard from Sshamath .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Piri was an apprentice in the College of Mages of his city, known for his skill in piecing together arcane texts. He was an acolyte of the skin .</p>
<p>In 1377 DR , Q'arlynd Melarn invited him to his new College of Ancient Arcana . There, Piri unlocked an ancient Ritual of Bonding and bonded himself with a quasit , Glizn .</p>
<p>However, Piri tried to betray Q'arlynd just before the casting of the elven high magic spell that erased Kiaransalee from everyone's minds. Q'arlynd killed him and afterward resurrected him. Q'arlynd used the kiira of Kraanfhaor's Door to remove Piri's disloyalty from his mind.</p>
<p>In 1379 DR , however, Piri started to act strange, worrying Q'arlynd. He started a magic duel with his fellow Eldrinn Elpragh . He summoned a deepspawn of the Breeder's Guild against Eldrinn before being knocked out. Later Master Q'arlynd arrived and defeated the monster.</p>
<p>Later, Q'arlynd discovered that the quasit bonded with Piri had manipulated him to kill Eldrinn to remove a possible rival. Q'arlynd cast a spell to send the demon back to the Abyss , but Piri's body also disappeared.</p>
<p>Later, it was discovered that Glizn had gained control of Piri's body. He was summoned by Streea'Valsharess Zolond , who asked him about Master Q'arlynd.</p>
