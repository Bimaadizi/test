<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Dimswart was a retired adventurer of the King's Men fame. He was close with his comrades in arms: King Azoun Obarskyr IV , the royal advisor Vangerdahast Aeiulvana , and his best friend and a regular drinking buddy Winefiddle .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Most of the King's Men adventurers remained unrecorded.</p>
<p>In 1357 DR Alias of Westgate sought the sage's help with the mysterious azure magical glyph tattoo, she woke up with one day. She arrived at the Dimswart Manor just a few days ahead of his daughter, Gaylyn 's wedding to a member of the noble Wyvernspur family . He was looking forward to quiet retirement after his last daughter would have left the family nest. He agreed to help the swordswoman in exchange for rescuing a bard named Olive Ruskettle who was hired to sing at the wedding but was captured by a fearsome red dragon on her way to the manor. Alias successfully returned the halfling bard and brought her just in time to save the wedding.</p>
<p>The wedding reception was eventually ruined by Alias. The azure glyphs forced her to attack the groom's cousin Giogi confusing him with King Azoun. The sellsword fled back to Suzail without retrieving the information Dimswart promised to collect. The sage shared the intel with his friend and Alias' new traveling companion Akabar Bel Akash noting that the mage was happy the adventure found him. Dimswart did not hold a grudge against Alias as he knew that she has been branded by powerful beings and was not in control of her actions.</p>
<p>In 1369 DR , Dimswart was called to aid in the abraxus affair . He determined that the affliction was a venom that spread a blood disease resistant to conventional magic, causing internal organ damage.</p>
