<p>Redfang Peak was a mountain located in the southern reaches of the Giantspire Mountains .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Blade, 1275 DR , King Lashilmbrar commissioned a mercenary band known as the Gauntlet of Doom to explore the area around Redfang Peak as part of a longstanding effort to find any trace of King Imbrar I , who disappeared somewhere in the area during the Year of the Luminar Procession, 1127 DR . While the mercenaries never returned to Impiltur, their captain, Delros Parander , was subsequently seen wielding the famous royal Impilturan sword known as Malagar , which he presumably discovered while on that expedition.</p>
