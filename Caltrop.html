<p>Caltrops were effective items used by some rogues and adventurers to dissuade pursuit.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Caltrops were known to come in a variety of shapes and sizes, though typically they had a spherical shape and were lined with either four or six spikes or prongs. These spikes were typically arranged in a tetrahedral pattern, which ensured that when tossed there would always be a spike facing up regardless of how a caltrop landed.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>When dropped on the ground during a pursuit, caltrops did a wonderful job of slowing down and even injuring the pursuing party, allowing a thief extra time to make his or her escape.</p>
<h2>Locations</h2>
<p>Though they were surely independently made in other lands of Toril , caltrops were known throughout the north to have been invented in Sundabar . They were a popular export of the Old Anvil Smithy within the city.</p>
<p>Pirates of the Nelanther Isles often used shattered rum bottles as caltrops.</p>
