<p>Hignog was a monstrous badger reputed to exist in Tabot .</p>
<p>Hignog was said to disguise itself as a man and kidnap and devour naughty children. Naturally, stories of it were used to frighten misbehaving children around Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) . The Tabotan monks dismissed such folklore as superstition.</p>
