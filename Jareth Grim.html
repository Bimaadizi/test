<p>Jareth Grim was the battle-leader of the Blackdagger Bandits that plagued travelers along the High Road during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Jareth was put in charge of the Blackdaggers' raiding operations while Traven Blackdagger accompanied the Red Wizard necromancer Kallos Tam into the Cragmire Crypts to gather undead forces and Malus Blackdagger prepared the defenses of Blackdagger Keep and an attack of Neverwinter itself. Jareth's role was to make it seem as if it was business as usual for the Blackdaggers and oppose the adventurer recruited by the Harpers to foil them. During this time, Jareth visited Krag Foultooth at Angelhead Mine for a report on their excavations there, before returning to Blackdagger Keep. Finally, Jareth's end came at the hands of the adventurer, who was directed by Garl Gnarlclaw to infiltrate Grimstorm Keep and slay the bandit captain. His death left the Blackdaggers in disarray and led to their final defeat.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>While battle-leader of the Blackdaggers, Jareth based himself in a tower of Blackdagger Keep, nicknamed Grimstorm Keep , likely for himself. There he lived like a pirate king, complete with his own throne.</p>
