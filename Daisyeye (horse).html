<h2>History</h2>
<p>Giogioni Wyvernspur, a young nobleman from Immersea, had owned Daisyeye for some time before 1357 DR when he was forced to ride Daisyeye from Dimswart Manor back to Immersea after a wedding reception. The horse was spooked by something, and threw Giogi into roadside mud and galloped ahead. Shortly after, Giogioni found the poor horse being devoured by an ancient red dragon , Mistinarperadnacles Hai Draco .</p>
