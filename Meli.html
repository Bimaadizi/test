<h2>History</h2>
<p>Meli was among the community of tieflings that resettled in the Emerald Grove druid enclave after being kicked out from Elturel in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . While there, Meli stole a special brass locket from the adventurer Barth , who had been hired along with others by the enclave's leader, archdruid Halsin . Barth confronted Meli about the amulet ― which had once belonged to his mother ― and chased Meli around the grove tring to get it back, much to the horror of other tieflings in the community.</p>
