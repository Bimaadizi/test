<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The river began in the Small Teeth and flowed north into the Zehoarast Flood Plain , where it turned sharply west on its short journey to the Sea of Swords .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This short river was less than 50 miles long, but it was important as a source of gold. Despite being dangerously fast-flowing, it was visited by prospectors every year when the floodplains receded, who panned its waters for nuggets.</p>
