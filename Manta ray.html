<p>Manta rays were large marine animals.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A manta ray looked like a giant flying wing. They were massive creatures, their mouth alone was up to 12 feet (3.7 meters) in width. And these gaping maws were toothless.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Despite their large size, manta rays were usually peaceful creatures.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>The manta ray's primary defense was a large stinger at the end of their tail, which inflicted temporary paralysis. Manta rays hunted in shallow areas, hiding on the ocean floor until prey swam into view.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Their diet consisted primarily of plankton and other small creatures. Though some claimed manta rays could swallow an average-sized humanoid whole in one bite.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Beyond the oceans of Toril , manta rays could be found on the planet Krynn .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Manta rays could often be found swimming among giant sea anemones , as they were immune to the effects of their tentacles.</p>
<p>Marids in Zakhara were known to use manta rays as companion animals or servants. One such marid was Kalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari , who had them in her Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls .</p>
