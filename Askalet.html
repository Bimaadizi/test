<p>Askalet was the easternmost of the three islands located south of Thelve and southwest from the the fortress library of Candlekeep . During the century that followed the Spellplague , its was a part of the so-called Cimarine Isles .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Askalet was a rocky outcropping that rose above the Sea of Swords . The island of fissured granite with temperate woods growing among the cracks. Askalet had rock-basin pools of freshwater collected from melted snow and summer fogs as well as several freshwater springs. A small two-vessel harbor was located at the center of the island's southern shores. Not far from it stood a fish -filled freshwater pond at the center of a wooded alley – the source of a dozen freshwater springs that trickled down the slop, eventually emptying into the Sea of Swords . In winter, the spring and their miniature waterfalls froze into a delicate and beautiful ice wall. Beyond the wooded valley, Askalet was a collection of wooded cliffs and ridges.</p>
<p>Askalet's eastern side was 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers) long, northern and western shores were 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) long each.</p>
<p>The island was once inhabited, but by the late 14 th century DR , it only held at least three ruins: an overgrown cottage with its roof collapsed located in the westernmost dell on Askalet. A ruined stone estate stood in the valley not far from the harbor, rumored to hide a pirate's trapped treasure. Ruins of a castle rose above the sea atop the island's easternmost cliffs. The castle was falsely believed to had been a pirate-baron's keep and, at one point – a mage 's tower. Elminster Aumar theorized that the said wizard, Askalath was the island's namesake.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Askalet's northern shores were separated by Skoond's Run from the large island of Thelve. To Askalet's west laid two sister islands of Nairn's Tomb and Arthoum . The isles of Askalet and Nairn's Tomb were 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) apart, while Arthoum laid 4.5 miles (7.2 kilometers) north of Askalet. The Sword Coast mainland was separated from Askaletby a 4.5 miles (7.2 kilometers) body of water at its narrowest and the strait known as the Racewind Passage .</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>Askalet was home to a massive population of seabirds numbered in thousands. The island's rocks were stained with the birds' guano . Several species of predatory sea creatures could also be found on the island. Deer and an occasion owlbear called the wooded labyrinth of rocks and fissure-caverns their home.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Askalet was once used by pirates and smugglers who likely gave the island its name. By the late 14 th century DR, the island's ruins were used by many as a shelter through the years. Despite that, the island was far from thoroughly looted. Askalath's tower had a well-hidden cellar with a shaft that dropped down into the dangerous depths of the Underdark . Some believed that the wizard used the shaft as a well, magically retrieving water from the far underground. However, the shaft's true value was in the multitude of cellar complexes, with their entrances opening into the endless shaft's lower reaches.</p>
