<p>Tyreus was an archmage from the world of Ravnica who came to Faerûn in search of the Stone of Creation during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tyreus had light skin.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The powerful mage was heavily motivated by the death of his parents, and his helplessness to protect them. This personal drive made led to excessive ambition, a vicious temper, and an insatiable thirst for power. He came to believe he possessed a form of ultimate arcane power, and used it to control every aspect of the world and people around him.</p>
<p>Over time, Tyreus became increasingly spiteful and selfish. He developed an intense air of self-importance, believing himself to be supremely more intelligent than everyone else in his orbit. Tyreus loved to hear himself talk and readily gloated when he had the upper hand on someone. This was a form of insecurity, taken by Tyreus to give himself more time to think through situations.</p>
<p>Tyreus saw every realm as potential future conquests, or viewed resources solely as means to an achieve his goals.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Tyreus sought to accumulate enough magical power to fulfill the grand future for which he was destined. His study of the arcane arts were focused largely on illusions , ones that were so precise, they manifested in real and tangible ways. He viewed his illusions as the key to manipulating others, and manifesting his fate.</p>
<p>He knew and regularly utilized the spell linked glyphs , as well as mighty fortress , maze , and plane shift , among others.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Tyreus amassed a significant fortune of gold coins and art objects, totaling over 18,000 gp in value.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>In defiance of his father's wishes, Tyreus began studying arcane magic as a teenager. He achieved great success in his continued studies throughout his life. After he acquired sufficient proficiency, Tyreus dedicated himself to recovering the five keystones of creation , fragments of an power artifact once owned by his grandmother.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Tyreus was the son of Ayraea and Tyberio , and the grandson of Sylvene , a planewalking adventurer originally from Ravnica. When his parents died of illness, Tyreus blamed them for the tragedy. He believed that if he was allowed to study arcane magic earlier in life, he would have had the power to save their lives.</p>
<p>At some point, Tyreus placed a geas on the elemental spirit named Exul , and treated the extraplanar being as his personal minion.</p>
<p>Tyreus' tremendous abilities and ambition attracted many other power-hungry wizards. He believed he could only form genuine relationships once he had accumulated enough power and his own realm. For a brief time, Tyreus formed a tenuous partnership with the Red Wizard , Morwena Veilmist. She attempted to convince Tyreus they could acquire power together, but quickly learned the archmage was only focused on his own ends. Unfortunately, they never developed any real trust with each other.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tyreus was born and raised on the planar city of Ravnica. He studied magic in secret during his youth, in defiance of his parents' wishes. When he was a teenager, plague struck his him, claiming the lives of his parents, Tyberio and Ayraea. After their deaths, he poured himself into his studies, hoping to gain enough knowledge to regain control over his life.</p>
<p>At some point during the late 15 th century, Tyreus and his elemental servant Exul traveled to the Wizard's Barrow in the High Moor in search of a great tome bound in white leather . His exploits attracted the attention of several Red Wizards, including Morwena Veilmist, and her apprentices. When the two groups encountered each other, Morwena abandoned her fellow Thayan wizards for Tyreus and his ambitions. The duo recovered the tome and left the barrow together.</p>
<p>Tyreus and Morwena traveled to a secluded demiplane once formed by Tyreus' grandmother Sylvene. During their visit, the archmage flew into a fit of rage when Seero ―one of the demiplane's caretakers―apparently took on a likeness that resembled Tyreus' father. Tyreus killed Seero in his anger. Aghast at the situated, Morwena departed from Tyreus' company, then aware that goals did not truly align with each other. Tyreus stole away a small collection of books and abandoned his one-time ally.</p>
<p>Tyreus' journey took him to the Sylvene's familial crypt, where he believed powerful magic remained. He then traveled to Highstar Lake to fulfill the destiny he sought for so long. It was there that Tyreus recovered one of the whole Stones of Creation . He used the Stone on a mighty fortress atop the waters of the lake, and took on the mantle of the "Cobalt Mage". Tyreus raised an army for himself, composed of conjured elementals and hired mercenary companies, including the Banner of Blades and the Iron Lions .</p>
