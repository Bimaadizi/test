<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to Mirtul 6 of the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Thail had gathered from records in Suzail that elves had lived by the Sember River .</p>
<p>Thail was a part of the Company of the Bright Spear on that date, when they stopped at the Rising Moon in Highmoon . There, after Lynxal of the company was slain, the whole company's valuables were robbed by Shandril Shessair , who asked to join them to replace their thief . They rode from Highmoon to Myth Drannor . Along the way, when confronted by heavy mist, Thail was ambivalent on whether they should continue within the mist or wait until it lifted. He was the first one to notice the water when they reached the edge of the Semberflow by evening. He was also the one to identify the best place to cross the river. He fought alongside the company when they were attacked afterwards, deciding not to use a spell to make their foes fall asleep given the situation, on Mirtul 12 .</p>
<p>After Elminster interfered by making their foes flee, Thail was sent to collect the company's horses . Shandril left to scout ahead following the attackers' caravan. When she returned after following a detachment sent to kill their pursuers, Thail rendered aid upon her when she was injured fighting the detachment. After they finally reached the Gates of Doom , Thail fought the wizard lookout, but enemy spells injured him. He perished on Mirtul 20 .</p>
<p>The wizard's demise was confirmed later by Delg and Elminster.</p>
