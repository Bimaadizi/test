<h2>History</h2>
<p>In life, Brysis was a great sorcerer in Netheril . On the day of her death, she was interred in a floating tomb.</p>
<p>After the fall of Netheril, Brysis's tomb plummeted into a crevasse and wound up in the Underdark region of the Silken Paths, where it remained for centuries.</p>
<p>Magical energies awoke Brysis from the eternal sleep of death as a wraith, served by specters who were once her loyal retainers.</p>
