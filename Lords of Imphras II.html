<p>The Lords of Imphras II , also known as the Council of Lords , was an advisory and governing body comprising the local lords of the kingdom of Impiltur . The assembly was first formed in the 14 th century DR , by King Rilimbrar of the Heltharn Dynasty .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Officially, the council was formed to act as stewards of the realm, until a suitable and honorable heir arose to rule over Impiltur. However, repeated royal deaths led to an extended tenure of governing, under the authority of Queen-regent Sambryl , daughter of Rilimbrar, who lengthened her life for many years by means of "longevity magic ".</p>
<p>They acted as advisers to the Impilturan royalty, oligarchical governors, military commanders and custodians of the Impilturan economy. They considered clear communication to be critical, and kept in contact with each other via magic and with the common folk through a network of riders known as the Heralds of Imphras II .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Highmantle, 1336 DR , King Rilimbrar married off his daughter Sambryl to her second-cousin Imphras IV , a devious and detestable noble with a distant claim to the Golden Throne. The ailing Rilimbrar was concerned his devious son-in-law was attempting to seize control the kingdom. As such, the king formed the Council of Lords of Imphras II and entrusted the rule of Impiltur to them upon his death. Having no male heirs of his own, the king intended the power of the Golden Throne to be passed to the descendants of his deceased uncle Velimbrar , the youngest son of Imphras II, with the council serving as stewards of the realm.</p>
<p>The council was originally composed of twelve paladins , all of whom were distant descendants of the fourth and sixth sons of the great King Imphras II , founder of the Most Holy Order of the Sacred Shrike . Several of the lords were knights of the order, while others belonged to others devoted to the deities of the Triad .</p>
<p>When the king died two years later in a great fire in the city of Dilpur , along with Crown Prince Imbrar IV, the infant prince Soarimbrar was named king but could not rule until his 16 th year. After the death of her father and husband, Sambryl ascended as Queen-Regent and acted as stewardess of the crown until Soarimbrar came of age, would occur in the Year of the Crown, 1351 DR .</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the realm, King Soarimbrar and his entire royal entourage were murdered by assassins in the farmlands outside of Lyrabar the same year he took the crown. A similarly premature death befell Prince-Regent Imphras V , in the Year of the Wyvern, 1363 DR , when he succumbed to a disease of consumption. Just as before, the Queen-Regent remained in power while the council attended to the actual governance of the kingdom.</p>
<p>During the mid-14 th century the council allowed the Red Wizards of Thay to establish their enclaves within the cities of Dilpur , Ilmwatch and Lyrabar. This action was viewed by some critics, among them the scholar Orauzalar , as both an act of appeasement to the merchant-class of the realm and a selfish endeavor that brought themselves significant personal wealth.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
