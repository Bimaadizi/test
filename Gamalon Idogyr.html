<p>He also possessed bracers of defense , a cloak of the bat , and boots of star striding and carried a staff of the magi .</p>
<p>While living in the city of Bral, Gamalon was a landowner and ran a magical curios shop, Gamalon's Curios , right at the edge of the Great Market . His private estate home was directly behind his shop and had a large courtyard and included several buildings.</p>
<p>Gamalon's official abode upon returning to Toril was the manor of Shildamere , which had belonged to his family.</p>

He had many connections among the powerful mages of Faerûn , including members of the Harpers , and could pass information to or from them for the King and Queen.

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h3>Family</h3>
<p>Gamalon was the son of Count Darud Idogyr . He was one of seven children. His mother's name was Arana. He also had an older half-elven half-brother through his father named Araneth Idogyr , who was also a wizard.</p>
<p>Gamalon's wife was Mynda Idogyr . The two were extremely close. She was killed on Uktar 28 , 1374 DR when a magical explosion occurred at the Sleeping Dragon inn. They had been married for 34 years at that time.</p>
<p>They had two children. The eldest was their son Perigon , who was born in 1343 DR . Their daughter, born in 1346 DR , was named Lara . She was Gamalon's favorite and his heir, as Perigon gave up his birthright to dedicate his life to serve The Triad .</p>

<h3>Friendships</h3>
<p>Gamalon was friends with Elminster Aumar and was a long time acquaintance of both Khelben Arunsun , who was actually his paternal great-grandfather, (through the line of Khelben's daughter Kessydra , ) and Laeral Silverhand ; for this he was secretly recruited into the Moonstars around 1370 . He also was friends with wizards even in other crystal spheres .</p>
<p>During his younger days, Gamalon adventured with a dwarf known as Cap'n Gyudd . After they both retired from adventuring, they each kept shops in the city of Bral and sent potential customers to each other's shops.</p>
<h3>Tutelage</h3>
<p>From 1369 DR , Gamalon was a tutor and protector of the bronze dragon Alaerurrgos , whose father and siblings had been slain by the blue wyrm Iryklathagra .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Much of Gamalon's family, including his mother and two oldest siblings, were killed in 1313 DR , when Gamalon was only eleven-years-old, during a series of feuds that occurred between his family and Clan Trecask from the Duchy of Dusk .</p>
<p>Gamalon was educated at the Mystics' Academy in Erlkazar.</p>
<p>Sometime in his early life, Gamalon became an adventurer and explorer. During one of these early adventures, Gamalon lost his left eye to an owlbear . At some unknown point, he received his magical gem eye as a gift from Khelben Arunsun.</p>
<p>In 1333 DR , Gamalon left Toril and his homeland of Tethyr and lived on the Rock of Bral , one of the Tears of Selûne , where he maintained a curio shop. At some point while there, Gamalon discovered a secret stash of orbus rings , which enhanced the power of spelljamming helmsmen. For a time, Gamalon was the only seller of such rings.</p>
<p>During his time on the Rock of Bral, he became enamored with a merchant's daughter, named Mynda. After four years of pursuing her, she finally agreed to become his wife.</p>
<p>During the Ten Black Days of Eleint , one of his sisters and one of his brothers and most of the members of their families were slain for being nobility.</p>
<p>Gamalon returned to Toril, to his grandfather's lands in County Spellshire near the Forest of Tethir , sometime before the First Siege of Myratma . He provided magical support in both the First and Second Sieges , and for this, he was rewarded his grandfather's old lands to rule over as count.</p>
<p>In 1370 DR , Gamalon, his daughter, her husband, and Timoth Eyesbright traveled to Trailstone after that town defected from Amn . These four helped train the citizens in defending their city.</p>
<p>In 1374 DR, Gamalon planned to break the "Tethyr Curse" by staying in Waterdeep over the winter. He planned to give guest lectures at Blackstaff Tower . On Uktar 28, 1374 DR, Gamalon, together with his wife and his party, arrived back at the Sleeping Dragon inn, on their way back to Waterdeep after a trip to Longsaddle . Raegar Stoneblade and Damlath had brought the Diamondblade to the inn, and Gamalon's green gem eye caused lightning bolts to transmit between it and the blade, destroying the front of the building and a large area of the upper floor.</p>
<p>Gamalon Idogyr, Raegar, and Damlath survived, but Gamalon's wife, many guards, and other bystanders were killed in the incident. While Gamalon was laid low, Damlath (who was possessed by the lich Priamon "Frostrune" Rakesk ) stole his gem eye.</p>
<p>Gamalon joined in Khelben's plan to stop Priamon, and the lich was defeated. At the end of the ordeal, Mystra herself rewarded him by giving him a new magical left eye.</p>
