<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jonczer was one of Maerjanthra Shalace's apprentices while she was alive. He was working under her since at least approximately the Year of the Crown, 1351 DR , the birth of Narnra Shalace , who was twenty or twenty-two years old in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR . At that time, he was told of Maerjanthra's plot to bear Elminster Aumar a child, on which she was aided by Khelben Arunsun , who under duress from Mystra gave her a potion to override Elminster's control over his own fertility, as accounted by his fellow apprentice, Goraun.</p>
<p>Shortly after Maerjanthra's death, Jonczer disappeared after a break-in killed his fellow apprentice Rorgel . Narnra assumed Jonczer was dead, though she saw a lot of blood and never actually spotted the body.</p>
