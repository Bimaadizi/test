<p>The Growling Hill was a peculiar site of interest in Amn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Originally the site of a wizard 's tower, the site fell to ruin and became buried by mud and grass growth, resembling a small irregularly shaped hill.

Local parents claimed there was a great beast living under the hill, who would surely eat naughty children.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The hill was about a day's walk northeast of Crimmor not far from the Bitten Road , north of the Alandor River and west of Minsor Vale and Lake Weng .</p>
