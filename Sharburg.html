<p>Sharburg , also known as the Sharburg , was a once-abandoned keep found in Tasseldale , that was later renovated into a manor house. It was considered one of the region's numerous " Ghost Holds ", abandoned estates which were often taken over by roving bandits or wandering monsters.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As of the midâ€“14 th century DR, Sharburg comprised a lone tower, encircled by a low stone wall. Within a few years, it was built up into a fortified keep that comprised several towers, complete with a military barracks, an armory, dungeons, and stables.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It was located in Tasseldale, relatively close to Essembra in neighboring Battledale . It was an isolated fortification, that was several miles southwest of the nearest Essembran manor-house.</p>
<p>One of the landmarks nearest to Sharburg was the inn of Markhouse , found near Tegal's Mark .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>For some time, the keep served as the headquarters for Tasseldale's Mairshars , as well as an audience chamber for the Grand Mairshar. Tasseldale's constabulary, along with local guardsmen, also used the keep as meeting place to conduct business.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Circa the mid-to-late 14 th century, Sharburg's main claim to fame was an exquisite and expensive dish, Beef Sharburg , sometimes served with Marsember beets and followed up with a bowl of eldritch berry custard . The dish could be found as far from the Dalelands as the town of Daggerford on the Sword Coast .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The tower Sharburg was originally built atop an old elven watchtower that had fallen to disrepair. It was fortified several times over the years, and was a fully-functioning military outpost for the Mairshars, as of the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR .</p>
<p>The keep did not remain an asset for the army of Tasseldale for long unfortunately. Sometime during or before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Sembia invaded Tasseldale, and took over Sharburg for their own. In Eleasis of that year, Ilsevele Miritar , Fflar Starbrow Melruth and other emissaries of the Elven Crusade were escorted to Sharburg, by their "host" Miklos Selkirk of the noble Sembian Selkirk family. They were held under guard for a time, "for their own protection".</p>
<p>As of the Year of Resurrections Rampant, 1441 DR , Sharburg had become the home of family of eccentric artists from Sembia. They gradually repaired the old keep, renovating it into a manor house. They used their new home to craft pottery, carve sculptures, and create other artistic goods. They tended their own crops, pleased to be away from the constant demands of Sembian fine society.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Among the family that took up residence in Sharburg were at least two wizards , who defended their fellows from any invading threats.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>According to local legends, if anyone spoke a specific phrase within Sharburg, a spectral door would appear, leading into an old elven safehold full of arcane weaponry.</p>
