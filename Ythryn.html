<p>Ythryn ( pronounced : /ˈ i θ r ɪ n / EETH-rin ), later known as the Necropolis , was one of the spectacular enclaves of Netheril that soared across the skies over a millennium before the Era of Upheaval . Like nearly all of the ancient empire's flying cities, Ythryn came crashing down to Toril , remaining largely intact as a necropolis embedded deep within the heart of the Reghed Glacier in the far North of Faerûn .</p>
<p>The submerged ruins were regarded as little more than a tomb for the ancient Netherese , full of deadly magic awaiting anyone who sought its arcane secrets.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The enclave was formed upon a large disc, atop which sat its many odd-shaped towers and turrets, along with several shorter, domed structures. The outer rim of the disk was dotted with fourteen wizard's spires, each of which resembled a single claw reaching over the city's edge.</p>
<p>As with other of Netheril's enclaves, Ythryn was powered by a single mythallar Its magic was the source of the city's flight capabilities, and could also recharge expended magic items.</p>
<p>The necropolis of Ythryn was the carrier for a form of magical disease known as the arcane blight , which slowly transformed living humanoids into nothics .</p>
<h3>Culture</h3>
<p>The residents of Ythryn spent much of their time either studying the arcane arts or reveling in a life of luxury and joy, without much want or need. They focused their academic work on the acquisition of information regarding the lost giant realm of Ostoria .</p>
<p>During its glory days, the city boasted an orchestra that was famous across all the lands of Toril . It also had a stadium that hosted matches of the popular sport known as Chain Lightning . Chimeric pets were quite popular among the citizens of Ythryn, particularly hares that were given wings.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The final resting place of Ythryn was about a 1 mi (1.6 km) southeast of the deepest reaches of subterranean Caves of Hunger .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>During its glory days, Ythryn was ruled by the Netherese arcanist Iriolarthas , who actually underwent the process of lichdom long before the city came crashing down to Toril.</p>
<p>The governance of the enclave was carried out by a cabal of eight arcanists referred to as the Wizards of the Ebon Star .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Iriolarthas and his apprentices first activated the city's mythallar and elevated the city into the skies, they traveled to the region of the continent that would later be referred to as the North . They searched for long-lost magics, that dated to the ancient giant realm of Ostoria .</p>
<p>Finally, in the autumn of the Year of Chilled Marrow, −343 DR , the arcanists of Ythryn recovered a large stone spindle bearing strange sigils at the floor of the Sea of Moving Ice . They began experimenting upon the recovered artifact, inadvertently causing an eruption of power that disabled the enclave's mythallar , and sending the flying city plummeting into the ground. During the catastrophe, a single wizard's spire broke off from the city and plunged into the tundra of Icewind Dale .</p>
<p>As the city crashed into the Reghed Glacier, the heat of the impact caused it to fall deeper beneath the icy surface. Once its descent was over, the Frostmaiden Auril covered the ruins in ice as a means to lay claim to the new prize. The few remaining survivors became trapped within the icy tomb; conventional means of escape were blocked by the enveloping ice, and magical means were thwarted by the lingering effects of the spindle .</p>
<p>Around the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , four wizards of the Arcane Brotherhood , Avarice , Dzaan , Nass Lantomir , and Vellynne Harpell , undertook an expedition to uncover the secrets of the frozen enclave. The scholars sought a means to end the Everlasting Rime that plunged Icewind Dale into eternal winter.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>It was said that the portion of glacier above the necropolis could be parted by an inscription included within the Codicil of White , a holy book of the Aurilian faith.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>The enclave housed eight different mage towers, one for each of the schools of magic .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In the time of ancient Netheril, the enclave of Ythryn housed the lich-arcanist Iriolarthas, his apprentices and other Netherese elites. The needs of powerful spellcasters were served a population of magically-created constructs, known as magen , that acted as protectors and servants. During this time, iron golems were also often used as guardians and sentries.</p>
<p>Some of the poor wretched souls who survived the crash eventually succumbed to death by starvation, and transformed into shadows after their death. One such survivor Drakareth , managed to survive a bit longer by killing some of the other surviving Netherese, before becoming a wraith himself.</p>
<p>In the centuries after its collapse, frozen necropolis became overrun by nothics , horrendous monstrosities that arose from the remains of spellcasters who succumbed to the arcane blight .</p>
