<p>The Stalactite Forest was a landmark located in Skullport .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Stalactite Forest was suspended above the Central Port. It was a dense concentration of large stalactites that resembled the fangs of a colossal maw. Concealed among these stone formations were vertical passageways utilized by creatures capable of vertical or aerial movement, including drow and beholders .</p>
<p>In response to the scarcity of habitable space, some residents of Skullport constructed dwellings and commercial establishments between, and occasionally within, the stone columns. However, on rare occasions, entire buildings collapsed, resulting in the catastrophic fall of stone and timber onto the areas below.</p>
<p>The Stalactite Forest also served as a hunting ground for various predatory creatures from Undermountain , drawn to the lights and activity of Skullport. Species commonly found in this area included cloakers , lurkers , mobats , and numerous varieties of spiders . The remains of unwary victims were often left suspended from the stalactites, catwalks, or rigging.</p>
