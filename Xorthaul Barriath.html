<p>Xorthaul Barriath was a drow-dragon rogue , assassin , and cleric of Vhaeraun and a member of the Jaezred Chaulssin who held the position of the Patron Father of Jhachalkhyn in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In his drow form, he wore the black mail of a priest of his faith and in his dragon form, he was a mature adult shadow dragon .</p>
<h2>Position</h2>
<p>He was a Patron Father on the Jaezred Chaulssin's leading council, where he was responsible for the major fosterage in Jhachalkhyn. He and his fosterage organized a series of assassinations during the Silence of Lolth , which shifted the power balance in Jhachalkhyn from Lolth's matriarchy to the city's merchant class, who then became their sponsors. After the Spellplague, he and his fosterage gained control over the city.</p>
<p>He represented the church of Vhaeraun in the assassins’ guild, inside of which members of the church held positions of influence. As the head of Chaulssin’s church, he tried to turn the Jaezred Chaulssin into the private army of the church, something the other Patron Father prevented from happening, a movement that accelerated after the Silence of Lolth ended to prevent an open clash with Lolth .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, Xorthaul was a drow-dragon cleric who learnt minor skills in the rogue and assassin professions, as was common among that church’s clergy and an entry requirement for the Jaezred Chaulssin.</p>
<p>As a drow-dragon, he could change between drow and shadow dragon forms and remain in each form for as long as he wished.</p>
<p>Like any other mature adult drow-dragon, he had a resistance against spells , against non-magical physical attacksm and complete immunity against life-sapping attacks. He also possessed minor abilities as a sorcerer and could cast the dimension door and mirror image spells, as well as the shadow dragons' breath weapon. He also had the ability to hide into shadows.</p>
<h2>Relatives</h2>
<p>He was the father of Antrysn Barriath , the Anointed Blade of the Jaezred Chaulssin. After he died, he raised him from the dead in order to take over his former positions from his successor and murderer Nimor Imphraezl .</p>
<h2>Residence</h2>
<p>Like any other Patron Father, he owned a residence in his fosterage in Jhachalkhyn, where he and his people lived under the front of minor nobility, and in Chaulssin , the main base of the assassins' guild, where the majority of his harem was found.</p>
