<p>Aegis-fang was the weapon of Wulfgar, son of Beornegar , of the Tribe of the Elk .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The head of this beautiful, cold-forged weapon was made from mithral , and the shaft was made from adamantite . A diamond coating was magically adhered to the entire weapon after its forging. The head was engraved with magical inscriptions, which were covered by the symbols of the dwarven gods Dumathoin , Moradin , and Clangeddin Silverbeard .</p>
<p>Aegis-fang was a cumbersome weapon, but was perfectly balanced for Wulfgar. Any person under 6 feet and 5 inches (2 meters) in height and without considerable strength would have a hard time wielding it properly.</p>
<h2>Power</h2>
<p>Aegis-fang was specifically attuned to its wielder Wulfgar and would magically return to his hands upon his telepathic command. In the hands of anyone else, the weapon would merely function as a warhammer with a generic +3 enchantment .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Near the time that Wulfgar's servitude to Bruenor Battlehammer would complete, the dwarf-king forged Aegis-fang for his adopted son as a special gift.</p>
<p>As with all dwarven master smiths, Bruenor had the chance to make one weapon of legend in his lifetime and invoked that chance to create Aegis-fang. It's design was inspired by a dream, given to Bruenor by the dwarven gods. He forged the pieces in a private temple with a sacred forge, forging the head in a single night on the summer solstice which also featured a full moon, a time of power which enhanced the magic of the scroll he read from. After attaching it to the adamantine rod he performed a powerful magical ritual. The demanding task took all of his skill and much of his energy but when it was done, the dwarf-king knew he would never make anything to equal it.</p>
<p>Wulfgar trained extensively with his new weapon, often training against Drizzt Do'Urden , who taught the young barbarian to master his weapon and himself. He used it in two battles against dragons — Ingeloakastimizilian (Icingdeath) and Haerinvureem (Shimmergloom) — both with triumphant results. The battle against Icingdeath was directly ended by Aegis-fang, when Wulfgar threw it into a large icicle, which fell, piercing the dragon's heart.</p>
<p>He also used it in a battle beside Drizzt Do'Urden and Bruenor when they were victorious in their brutal fight against the balor Errtu .</p>
<p>In 1365 DR , Josi Puddles stole Aegis-fang, selling it off to the pirate captain Sheila Kree , who later used its mark to brand her followers. In 1366 DR , when the Companions of the Hall tracked down the pirate hideout of Golden Cove , the ogre Bloog used Aegis-fang in battle against Drizzt. However, his ally, Le'lorinel , grew bored of the fight and helped Drizzt kill him. Drizzt then sent Regis off with the hammer, who returned it to Wulfgar.</p>
