<p>" Cantrip " was the common name for the weakest spells an arcane spellcaster could cast. The divine magic equivalents were known as orisons , but "cantrip" was often used to describe all beginner apprentice/acolyte spells. Cantrips were the first spells that a wizard learned during their apprenticeship.</p>
<p>The effects that could be created were very minor, very brief, and mostly harmless, intended to entertain children or impress commoners, although some newer cantrips could cause damage.</p>
