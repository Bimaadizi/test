<p>Fisherlings were thieves —generally children—active in the Malar's Throat slums of Port Nyanzaru as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Fisherlings were so-named for their tactic of "fishing" for unsuspecting people's coin purses and other valuables from the high suspension bridges that spanned the Malar's Throat ravine. They would skillfully dangle a fishhook from a long line or wire —sometimes from hundreds of feet above ground level—to steal possessions directly from victims' belts . They were known to target individuals wearing unsecured items and satchels that appeared to be carrying valuables. If spotted by their victims, they gleefully reeled in their lines and scattered into the slums, taking cover in the crowds.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The fisherlings were a well-known hazard of visiting Malar's Throat as of the late 15 th century DR.</p>
