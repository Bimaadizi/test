<p>Vraedna was a drow sorcerer of the adventuring company - the Lady's Lament from Waterdeep , active circa 1310 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Vraedna was a tall obsidian-skinned maiden with long white hair. She wielded a longsword and a shortbow in battle, as well as her impressive innate skills with the arcane magics. Relatively new to the surface, Vraedna's greatest fear was being abandoned by her comrades and left to fend for herself in the new and alien world.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Vraedna hailed from the grim pitch black Underdark . She was one of the rebel drow who chose to abandon the worship of Lolth and fled to the surface. Eventually, she joined the Lady's Lament in the City of Splendors. Vraedna hoped that being a member of the goodly adventuring troupe would improve her reputation and allow the surface world to overlook her evil heritage.</p>
<p>In 1310 DR, the Lady's Lament, along with many other mercenaries, traveled from Luskan to the besieged city of Targos in the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale .</p>
