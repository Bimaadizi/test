<p>Feywine was an ancient type of wine .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Feywine was a fermented mixture of honey , crushed flowers, and a secret ingredient. This ingredient was unknown to all races but for a few elves , though some speculated that it was distilled moonbeams. Alternatively, feywine was known to be created by stirring a raisin from the Feywild into a glass of water.</p>
<p>When bottled away from fresh air, feywine would only last for a period of two days.</p>
