<p>Leira's Trick was an expensive inn and tavern located in the city of Samargol in Samarach .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Leira's Trick stood in the Openpalm Bazaar district of Samargol– the only part of Samargol open to outsiders. The inn itself was the only establishment in the city that was allowed to cater to visitors of the City of Veils.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The tavern stood on the western side of the Openpalm Bazaar, neighboring a shrine of Waukeen and a beautiful decorative fountain at the center of the district. A sign by the entrance attracted visitors, and the tavern offered a handful of outdoor seating for those willing to brave the sweltering heat of Samarach.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The tavern's main doors opened into a spacious taproom with a long wooden bar stand on the left side of the room and numerous tables and booths to the right from the entrance. A small stage for performing minstrels was located at the back of the taproom by an open flame fire pit. A huge common room was located to the left of the main entrance, and more expensive, more private rooms– were across from the entrance and on the right side. The kitchen was hidden behind the bar at the back of the taproom.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Leira's Trick offered quality lodgings, food, and libations to those who could afford its higher-than-average prices. A room for five was rented for fifty gold coins a day.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR, Leira's Trick was run by the aging innkeeper Tanerieh , a devote follower of Leira . In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , a group of adventurers who survived the shipwreck of the Vigilant used the inn as the base. During their stay in the City of Veils, famed writer Volothamp Geddarm visited the establishment and later mentioned it in the Volo's Guide to the Serpent Kingdoms .</p>
