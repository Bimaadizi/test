<p>Gathen , known as the Swiftsword and Gathen Swiftsword , was a retired warrior and adventurer in the village and vale of Maskyr's Eye in the Vast in the late 13 th or early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Over time, a number of ex-adventurers had retired to the vale, and occasionally they went to the nearby abandoned mage's tower known as Maskyr's Tower to try their luck on its wards, thinking they might find some heretofore undiscovered vulnerability. Yet its wards proved impenetrable, so they left with nothing. Finally, one of them, Gathen Swiftsword, had grown impatient with this over the years and resolved to take a brute-force approach. He rode to Mulmaster and returned with a 30-strong crew of hired 'strongarm' laborers whom he ordered to simply tunnel through the walls with bars, hammers , and picks .</p>
<p>After two days of effort, they'd made one breach and almost had a second. Impatient to begin, the Swiftsword donned his old armor and collected his old weapons, and headed inside. He was never seen again. In fact, in an upper level, Gathen encountered a gargoyle -like guardian monster that proceeded to rip his arms and legs off, and was later transformed into a dragon .</p>
