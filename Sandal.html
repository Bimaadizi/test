<p>Sandals were a common form of footwear that could be found throughout the Realms .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This form of footwear typically consisted of a leather sole that was held in place by a series of loops around the wearer's ankle, toes, or the top of their foot. When a sandal lacked an ankle strap the loose sole tended to slap against their wearer's heel or toes when they walked, which made walking quietly difficult without practice.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid to late-14 th century DR , one could purchase sandals from many of the bazaars in Zakhara for around 7 to 4 copper pieces depending upon how good they were at bargaining.</p>
<p>Around that same time, Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue was the sole exporter of Calimshan 's unique sandals. They were made of fine grain leather in shades of black, brown, or white and had full brass buckles.</p>
