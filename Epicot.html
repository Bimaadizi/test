<p>Epicot was a renowned wizard from Arabel , Cormyr , in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Epicot was a powerful arcane spellcaster whose spellbook was chock-filled with spells.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The wizard resided in his lone 30‑foot-tall (9.1‑meter) tower in the city of Arabel. He stored his magical tools in the spellcasting chamber on the tower's top floor. His spellbook had 35 spells, and his wand of wonder was always charged to the maximum capacity. He kept a detailed personal journal.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Epicot had a close relationship with a widowed baker who lived a block away. Maggie Rollins regularly sent her son Little Michael to the wizard's tower with a basket of fresh honeyed buns . Epicot thought the woman was trying to show her affections, but the wizard was unwilling to reciprocate. In turn, Epicot thought the child to be a bright young man and hoped to have Michael as his apprentice one day.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On the 19 th of Flamerule of the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , Epicot became alarmed by three nights of heavy thunderstorms in a row, something that hadn't happened in over 90 years. The same day, Little Michael informed Epicot of a strange-looking bearded man asking the child about the wizard's daily schedule. The stranger clad in green offered Michael a honeycomb in exchange for information. This sparked Epicot's suspicions, and he warded the door of his tower with a fire trap spell. The following day, the 20 th of Flamerule , he received a shipment of frogs for magical experiments. The green-garbed man was seen around the tower several times that day. The mysterious man was Brokus of the Night Parade .</p>
<p>The Night Parade was working to open a gate to launch an invasion into Arabel, and they tracked down and assassinated powerful wizards who could pose a problem for the plot. Epicot's demise came on the night of Flamerule 20 th . He was murdered by Brokus and Zupar , who turned a wall of the wizard's tower into water and swiftly decapitated him. The Night Parade took the head away to ensure there would be no resurrection , and carved the symbol of Zhentarim on his chest to blame another faction. The following morning citizens of Arabel noticed a wall missing in Epicot's tower and informed the city guards. His headless body was buried on the 21 st of Flamerule .</p>
<p>After his death, Epicot's kin rewarded the wizard's magical items to the heroes tasked by the Lady Lord of Arabel with investigating the wizard murders.</p>
