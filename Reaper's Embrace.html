<p>The Reaper's Embrace was a suit of magical plate mail armor associated with the Myrkulyte faith. It was famously worn by General Ketheric Thorm during the Absolute crisis of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The armor was quite beautifully crafted, with adornments that evoked both skeletal forms and symbology of Myrkul himself. The breastplate was crafted to resemble the bones of a ribcage, featuring an open maw gorget with thorn-like teeth that threatened to swallow the wearer whole. The pauldrons of the Reaper's Embrace were decorated with detached, decrepit hands grasping onto golden skulls. Likenesses of other skulls, skeletons, and numerous iterations of Myrkul's holy symbol were engraved across several pieces of the armor.</p>
<p>The center of the armor's breastplate held a golden adornment, within which Ketheric Thorm set his netherstone .</p>
<p>Ketheric preferred to wear a chain shirt and elaborately embroidered gambeson were worn underneath the armor.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The wearer of the armor could incite the reaper's rigidity , a supernatural state that prevented from being moved or knocked over against their will. Unfortunately, this power also prevented the wearer from moving with any real grace or agility.</p>
<p>One or more times per day the wearer of Reaper's Embrace could let out a howl of the dead . This inflicted numbness in the extremities of any creatures within a 10 ft (3 m) radius.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ketheric remained in possession of the armor as of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , following his second conversion, fromt the Sharran to the Myrkulyte faith.</p>
