<p>Iron Keep was a small city on Oman's Isle in the Moonshae Isles . It was named for the massive fortress of the same name that stood above it, and it served as the capital of the Northlander kingdom of Oman prior to that realm's collapse. It lay abandoned and in ruins as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The city largely comprised longhouses spread around the base of a rocky hill beside the waters of Iron Bay , atop which sat the enormous and sprawling fortress of Iron Keep. Surrounding the town were fields and pastures.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The settlement lay on the eastern side of Iron Bay where a large valley met the bleak shore. It sat along a long beach which provided space for the stowage and construction of Oman's famous longships , and the broad valley provided space to accommodate the camps of large armies.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The rulers of Oman were the most powerful of the Northlander kings as of the mid–14 th century DR, overseeing lands across Oman's Isle and Gwynneth and personally involving themselves in the defense of the realms and the local shipbuilding traditions.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>At its height, the city was directly defended by a fleet of ten longships, each manned by 40 warriors . Additionally, the king could field a legion of 80 elite berserkers aboard two additional ships.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Iron Keep was a major Northlander port for trade with the other realms of the Moonshaes and with far off Waterdeep and Ruathym .</p>
<p>The city was known for its master shipwrights . They specialized in building longships, and their process involved the contributions of alchemists to make sealant , blacksmiths to make iron sockets and nails , ropemakers to twist ropes , and sewists to make the sails.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of the Snow Winds, 1335 DR , the city was visited by Elminster on his tour of the Moonshaes.</p>
<p>In Tarsakh of the Year of the Saddle, 1345 DR , a council of Northlander kings met at Iron Keep and elected to launch a war against the Ffolk kingdom of Corwell in what would become known as the Darkwalker War . On Marpenoth 13 of that same year, the god Bhaal sent an earthquake that all but leveled the city.</p>
<p>The city had been rebuilt by the mid-to-late-14 th century DR, by which time Oman had joined the United Moonshae Isles . In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , it was said that Northlander raiders flying the colors of Iron Keep had begun to violate the peace of the unified kingdom, and it was hoped that this was a case of imposters trying to stoke tensions rather than a true return to violence by the Northlanders.</p>
<p>but was then destroyed and its people slaughtered by firbolgs and fomorians in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR . It lay abandoned through the late 15 th century DR, with its harbor filled with traps and its fortress inhabited by monsters.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Northlanders of Iron Keep were infamous for their violent and warlike attitudes, which made some of their allies worried that they could not be trusted in times of peace. They were also known to be gracious and generous hosts to their allies. Honored visitors could expect to be greeted by strong men to help secure their boat as well as dancing and screaming children and women. Special occasions, such as the completion of a new longship, were celebrated with feasting and with kegs of dark ale , with revelry lasting until dawn.</p>
