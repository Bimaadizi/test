<p>Lasaonar was a drow swordmaster who lived in Ust Natha .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He was known to participate in duels in the Ust Natha tavern duel arena.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR , Gorion's Ward , when disguised as a drow, had the chance to watch Lasaonar fight four people at once in the tavern. After this, Gorion's Ward and his party were offered to fight Lasaonar in a duel themselves.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Lasaonar wore drow-made adamantine full plate armor and carried two enchanted swords that were similarly made of adamantine. Whereas one of these was an ordinary drow-made longsword , as carried by several other drow, the other was actually the Blade of Searing , a bastard sword that struck with fire and was made of a special alloy that would endure the sunlight once taken back to the surface, unlike other drow-made items.</p>
<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>It was rumored that he would give up his bastard sword to Gorion's Ward, if defeated by one of his group in combat.</p>
