<p>Aocha was a trained docile huge spider mount that belonged to Zack Boosenburry of Baervan Wildwanderer circa 1312 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Aocha had brownish markers and wore a narrow, almost invisible leather collar connected to a set of delicate reins. She was a docile beast that did not attack or scurried away from humanoids .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , Aocha accompanied her master, illusionist gnome Zack Boosenburry to a newly erected ice temple of Auril in Icewind Dale . Zack attempted to investigate the strange structure but was ambushed and fed to a remorhaz controlled by the goddess's cult. Aocha was taken to a cell filled with deer , the food storage used to feed the Aurilan monsters. Miraculously, Zack Boosenburry survived inside the remorhaz for several days until he was cut out of the monster by a group of mercenaries from Targos working against the cult of Auril. Aocha was reunited with her master shortly after.</p>
