<p>Zendulth Street , formerly known as Zenduth Street until its name had been corrupted over time, was a major and extensive street in the city of Waterdeep that began in the city's North Ward and continued into the city's Trades Ward , running along the entire length of the western wall of the City of the Dead .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This street began in the North Ward at the intersection of Golden Serpent Street , Saerdoun Street , and the Cliffwatch . It ran southwest off of them and, like the former two roads, Zendulth Street was initially paved in cobblestone. It became paved in hard-packed dirt and gravel for a block after passing its first gate into the City of the Dead, then became paved in corduroy-logs as it reached its second gate.</p>
<p>Along the way to that second gate, the road was met from the south by Beacon Street and Malkur's Ride , then from the north by Mhalsymber's Way and Sammarin's Street . Once passing the western end of Sammarin's Street, this avenue became part of the Trades Ward as it passed through Andamaar's Street .</p>
<p>Zendulth Street would continue to be paved in corduroy-logs for the majority of its length, becoming briefly cobblestone as it cut through the eastern end of the Coffinmarch and its entrance to the City of the Dead. On its way to the Coffinmarch, the road was met from the west by Selduth Street , and a block after passing the Coffinmarch it would be met by Ironpost Street . Finally, Zendulth Street ended at the southwestern corner of the City of the Dead, at an intersection of Burnt Wagon Way and Wall Way .</p>
