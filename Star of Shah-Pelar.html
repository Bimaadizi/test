<p>The Star of Shah-Pelar was one of five Star Gems of Martek that the wizard Martek was said to have imbued with an enchantment to retrieve his Sphere of Power, but would actually resurrect him.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Star of Shah-Pelar was a huge faceted ruby .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Inside the Crypt of Badr Al-Mosak , the Star of Shah-Pelar formed a keystone of its own defenses, as its facets reflected deadly rays throughout its room. If removed without replacing its weight in its stand, other rays would fall from the ceiling of the room, capable of petrifying anyone they touched. Those rays could be scattered through the room and even outside if they touched the Star of Shah-Pelar, making them that much more dangerous.</p>
<p>The gem might also have been able to generate an effect akin to cure serious wounds thrice a day.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The wizard Martek had given the Star of Shah-Pelar to an unnamed pharaoh of the desert, from whom it was stolen by Badr Al-Mosak . The thief later would have the gem interred with him in his crypt . Adventurers recovered the gem in 1356 DR , using it to restore Martek to life.</p>
