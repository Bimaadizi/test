<p>Kier Thunsonn was a male dwarf who lived in Eartheart near the East Rift . He was Torrin Ironstar 's adopted nephew and was very close to Torrin.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1480 DR , Kier stole a griffon and flew it to an earthmote hovering over the rift. Inside the mote, he found a cache of gold bars. Unfortunately, the bars were contaminated with the stoneplague , which Kier contracted. In order to save Kier's life, Torrin bought magical ointment that placed Kier into suspended animation until the stoneplague curse could be lifted.</p>
<p>Torrin was killed destroying the duergar magic that caused the stoneplague. However, many years later, Moradin reincarnated Torrin's soul and he was re-born as Kier's son.</p>
