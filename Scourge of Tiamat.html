<p>A scourge of Tiamat was, much like a scourge of fangs , a scourge with snakes in place of normal cords.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The snakes that made up the scourge's cords were all vipers , a size smaller than the wielder a copy was designed for.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A scourge of Tiamat was functionally fairly similarly to a scourge of fangs. One notable difference was that its vipers could spit out corrosive venom from up to 30 feet (9.1 meters), affecting a target with both poison and acid .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These weapons dated back to the height of the sarrukh empire of Okoth . Most copies of these weapons that existed by 1373 DR were ones recovered from that empire's scattered ruins.</p>
<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
<h3>Groups</h3>
<p>These weapons were typically favored in Unthalass by the Dark Scaled Ones , high- priests of Tiamat .</p>
