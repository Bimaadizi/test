<p>Ziose was the name given by sages to a particularly transparent variety of rosaline .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ziose was a rare mineral that yielded facet-grade stones that flashed three different colors depending on how the light refracted through them or at what angle they were viewedâ€”purple, blue, and red, or purple, green, and red (see Gallery ). Very large (fist-, foot-, or human-head sized) specimens of these fancy stones were sometimes found and prized for use in pendants by very tall humans , demihumans , and humanoids . A typical stone had a base value of 100 gp.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A ziose gem could fire multiple barrages of magic missiles at the command of the last creature to touch it, provided that creature had intelligence and knowledge of this ability. This being had to be within a few yards (meters) of the gemstone and only had to will it to happen. Salvos of missiles would continue for a few minutes and then cease. The ziose could not be activated again until it had time to recharge. This ability required no other effort or concentration from the activator, so it is unclear whether multiple targets could be affected, or whether the missiles came out of a single facet all in the same direction.</p>
