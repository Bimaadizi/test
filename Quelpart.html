<p>The Quelpart was an island and fortress lying between Kang Bay and the Sea of Kozakura , off the coast of the Koryo Peninsula . It was important to the defense of Koryo , particularly against Kozakura , being the staging area of the kingdom's entire armada.</p>
<p>The fortress and armada depended on daily barges via the Tenasu Ferry from the nearby city of Tu Pe for supplies. The city could support Quelpart for up to two months if under siege.</p>
