<p>Blevynsoar House was a shop in Athkatla 's rich Gem District in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Blevynsoar House stood in the chaotically clustered eastern part of the Gem District. Its northernmost neighbor was Fallenstar Fine Gems shop across the street, and Redcloak Trading on Sarbront's Walk , several doors east.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The shop dealt in expensive jewelry and maps. Jewelry on offer was unimpressive by the Gem District's bloated standards, but the shop's main stock was maps dealt from its back room. The owner did not allow browsing, knowing that a map's true price depended on the number of eyes and copies. The establishment also purchased maps, yet due to the proprietor's impressive memory, it was almost impossible to sell him fakes. On occasion, Blevynsoar House commissioned adventures to go on mapping expeditions on the proprietor's behalf.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The shop's proprietor, Jared Blevyn , the "Mapmaster of Amn," was known as a loyal employee of the gem-trading Zhanye family of Athkatla. While under its employ, Jared traveled countless roads and, thanks to his uncanny memory, mapped every single detail along his travels. One day, sometime before the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Jared used his mapmaking to discover a treasure of Parlek's Folly . He used the loot to open the Blevynsoar House.</p>
