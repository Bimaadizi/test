<p>King's Herald Westar of Arabel , commonly known as Westar of the Gates , was a human fighter and member of the the Heralds of Faerûn , whom he served as a local agent in that fortified, Cormyrean city. From there, he assisted Myrmeen Lhal , Arabel's lord and ruler, with her governance.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Westar was known for his good work, being an honest man whom many could trust. Those who had heard of this reputation, however, were equally familiar with his one idiosyncrasy: he never worked on the first day of any given month . Thanks to his otherwise impeccable work, he was not begrudged this quirk, but inquiries as to his unknown reasoning were nonetheless met with reticence.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Serving Myrmeen directly was only one of hundreds of duties that Westar took up, which included acting as an official witness to any legal sentencing, contract, or promissory note of any kind. He was also tasked with recording Arabel's many paid taxes, its deeds, and even the city's births and deaths.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Westar was already established as Arabel's local Herald by 1356 DR , and he held the post for decades after.</p>
<p>However, by Midwinter of the Year of the Lost Keep, 1379 DR , Lady Myrmeen had bestowed upon him even greater influence and authority in the city. This served as the beginning of her retirement from rulership, though she still waited for the Crown to officially grant her leave and name a proper successor.</p>
