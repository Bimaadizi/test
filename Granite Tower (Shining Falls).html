<p>The Granite Tower was a tower in the halfling village of Shining Falls in the Delimbiyr Vale .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It stood at the center of Shining Falls, with all the village's roads forming concentric rings around it or else radiating from it.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Dominating the small village, it was a keep that stood roughly 90 feet (27 meters) tall and comprised eight stories. It had an octagonal shape, was built of granite , and was bedecked with architectural gargoyles and grotesques. These were similar to those that adorned the bridge over the River Delimbiyr in Loudwater . Opinions varied as to whether it was ornate or gaudy, a work of art or an eyesore.</p>
<p>Surrounding its base was a wall (a later addition to the tower), forming a close courtyard within, and a moat. Though the water was clean and fresh, its source was unknown. On the southern courtyard wall was a small squat tower that served as the town armory for its militia.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to local theories and the Hegredathas , a written history of the Delimbiyr Vale , the Granite Tower was built by the master dwarven builder Iirikos Stoneshoulder , who built the bridge in Loudwater. Proponents of the theory pointed to the similar stonework and grotesques as proof. The Hegredathas related the story that Iirikos was commissioned by Silifrey the Spraystrider , an Illuskan wizard rumored to practice dark magic . Ignoring the warnings and pleas of his elven friends, who were left bewildered by his choice, Iirikos built the Granite Tower swiftly using summoned elementals . But he also installed magical wards that would activate and destroy any who worked evil magic within its walls. Silifrey was slain before a month had passed.</p>
<p>Afterward, several settlements grew up around the Granite Tower over the centuries, with nearly half-a-dozen human communities and at least two elven ones. But, without fail, every one of them suffered the mysterious disappearance of nearly all its residents, with the reason for or connection between these disappearances unknown.</p>
<p>The latest known was that of the elven colony of Thelthin'dul. Some time before 1272 DR , their caravan to Loudwater returned and discovered all of the citizens had vanished. The few remaining elves in the caravan refused to ever come near the place, so their caravan guards, the Fengrath family of mercenaries, moved into the Granite Tower and declared themselves rulers of the renamed town. No one contested their claim.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Since they moved in, the Granite Tower was home to the Fengrath family, the rulers of Shining Falls, from Walenburh Fengrath to her great-grandson, Deogol Fengrath , circa 1372 DR . They lived there with their family, servants, and guards, who tended also to be family, as well as Deogol's shield guardians and other constructs . He worked on his crafts and magic inside the tower.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR, folk feared that the Granite Tower was cursed or still haunted by the vengeful spirit of Silifrey the Spraystrider, and moreover that she sometimes went on rampages and was the cause of the disappearances. Legends added hidden tunnels beneath the tower and village that housed the undead skeletons of all those who'd vanished over the years. The strongheart halflings of Shining Falls scoffed at such stories.</p>
<p>One fellow in the village claimed to have seen skulking inside the keep an unusual dwarf -like creature with pale skin, bulbous eyes that lacked both pupils and irises, and ugly face muttered insanely. However, Deogol's guards were unsurprised and the witness believed Deogol had summoned it through magic.</p>
