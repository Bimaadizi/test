<p>Heartleaf's Garden was the last remnant of a grove on Mount Hotenow that survived the destruction caused by the volcano's eruption in the midâ€“15 th century DR . It comprised a single tree that was tended by Heartleaf , the dryad after which it was named.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Mount Hotenow erupted in the Year of Knowledge Unearthed, 1451 DR , an entire grove of trees was incinerated and nearly all the dryads that dwelled within died off. By some miracle, the young sapling Heartleaf managed to survive the devastation. Heartleaf remained in her garden for decades, dedicating her existence to the regrowth and renewal of her sisters' lost trees.</p>
