<p>The Teshyllal Wastes were the desert wastelands surrounding the ruins of the ancient city of Teshyll .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Teshyllal Wastes were the central region of the Calim Desert . Howling noises could often be heard over its barren lands, most likely the calls of the spirits of Calim and Memnon , who were defeated and imprisoned there.</p>
<p>The Wastes contained a fey crossroad that linked to Herkemon's Hub on the western banks of the Lake of Steam .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Once known as the Teshyllal Fields , the Teshyllal Wastes formerly contained lush and productive farms. The city of Teshyll was at its core, serving as a farmers' market. After the imprisonment of Calim and Memnon in around −6100 DR , the area grew barren and became one of the most dangerous regions of the Calim Desert.</p>
