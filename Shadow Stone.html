<p>The Shadow Stone was a major artifact created by Madryoch . It was destroyed by Aeron Morieth in 1369Â DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was a large black monolith, held by a frame of iron inlaid with runes.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>It weakened the magic around it, but it did not affect spells cast through the Shadow Weave . All those who touched the stone became enthralled, and had their magic modified to use the Shadow Weave.</p>
<p>Sometime after 1364, Madryoch adapted the Shadow Stone through a rite in order to increase its influence for hundreds of miles around, causing extensive damage to the ecology throughout Chessenta .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Madryoch created it before being banished to the Demiplane of Imprisonment . The wizard would return in the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR as "Master Oriseus", using the Shadow Stone to gain adepts and increase his power; he'd adapt the stone some time later to weaken the magic throughout Chessenta. In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Aeron Morieth induced its destruction by casting erase to delete the runes on its iron frame. Since he was casting through the Shadow Weave, the stone did not absorb the spell.</p>
