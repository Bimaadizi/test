<p>Thalaskos was a mage of Alaghôn in Turmish in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The wealthy merchant Fingarl hired Thalaskos at great expense to enchant his massive ruby , known as Fingarl's Flame , with a certain security measure—it would become incredibly hot and emit a deafening scream when moved away from its owner, specifically, "from the eyes of Fingarl". This was a secret known only to Thalaskos, Fingarl, and a half-dozen of the merchant's trusted agents.</p>
<p>Finally, Fingarl was found in his office one day, with both his ruby and his head missing! Thalaskos supposed the thief had learned of the security measure somehow and taken the merchant's head to circumvent it. Both remained missing as of around 1360 DR .</p>
