<p>Glooglugogg was a kuo-toa whip living in Sloobludop in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Glooglugogg was very loyal to his goddess and his father. He, however, disliked strangers involved in local businesses.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Glooglugogg lived quietly in the village of Sloobludop on the Darklake , ruled by his father Ploopploopeen . He took care of Blibdoolpoolp 's temple. In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, however, his sister had a vision of a new god Leemooggoogoon the Deep Father (in truth, demon lord Demogorgon ) and spread her new religion among the kuo-toa. Soon, she had gathered so many followers that their father Ploopploopeen started to make plans to reclaim his position. Despite Glooglugogg's objections, Ploopploopeen recruited a party of adventurers who had escaped from drow slavers of Velkynvelve as bait.</p>
<p>Glooglugogg, Ploopploopeen, some guards, and the adventurers went to Leemooggoogoon's temple in the guise of offering sacrifices. Bloppblippodd was pleased of her supposed victory over her father, and, after first sacrificing the duergar Hemeth , she intended to sacrifice the adventurers, but at that time the adventurers, Ploopploopeen, Glooglugogg, and his warriors attacked her and her lieutenants, all part of his plan to infiltrate the temple disguised to cut off the head of her cult. At this point, however, "Leemooggoogoon", along with dozens of ixitxachitl , rose from Darklake and started to destroy Sloobludop, killing all present.</p>
