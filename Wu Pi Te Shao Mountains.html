<p>The Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains were a series of mountain ranges in southwestern Kara-Tur . They were called the Peerless Mountains (or "Wu Pi Te Shan Mo") and also spelled the Wu Pi Te Shar Mountains (or simply "Wu Pi Te Shar" ). They were the southern part of the great Yehimal range that dominated the continent.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains stood south of the country of Tabot (whose southern borders extended into the mountains) east of the lands of the Utter East (specifically Konigheim and Vanesci Hamlet , on the south side of Phantom Pass ), and north of the Sempadan Forest . In the middle, the mountains branched sharply, with one arm running to the south and two to the east, together enclosing the Hanya Maut Wasteland and the Medan Perang Grasslands . In fact, some mapmakers divided the range into the Northern Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains , those which stood directly south of Tabot and north of the Hanya Maut Wasteland, and the Southern Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains , which stood to the west. The southern branch joined via a narrow neck with the World Pillar Mountains in the continent of Zakhara . The two western branches, meanwhile, linked to the extensive Shao Mountains network of southern Kara-Tur; these were separated by the Medan Perang upland.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The lower slopes of the mountains, those facing Tabot and greater Kara-Tur to the north and northeast, were swathed in lush vegetation, and experienced warm and humid weather. Nevertheless, Tabot suffered avalanches, mud-slides, dust-storms, and bitterly cold winds descending from the glaciers. The Peerless Mountains steadily grew to soaring heights, with frozen and jagged peaks. These proved an insurmountable barrier to the Tabotans.</p>
<h2>Locations</h2>
<p>The Northern Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains held Kemati Valley and Keru'ai Valley , while the Southern Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains held Senja Plateau and the forested Kaget Valley , which could be reached from the Medan Perang Grasslands via the Tentu Pass . The Shao Mountains Trail ran east out of the Southern Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains and to Tangkap Oasis in the very center of the Hanya Maut Wasteland.</p>
<p>In the western mountains, lying beside a glacier was the high Forbidden Plateau . It could only be reached by the Phantom Pass .</p>
<p>The Web Mountains were an area of the range lying between Konigheim in the Utter East and the Herne's Wood part of the Sempadan Forest.</p>
<p>In the far southwestern reach, beyond Konigheim and the Web Mountains, were the Puzzle Palace and the Hall of Wonder .</p>
<p>A secret, major temple to Grumbar was hidden within the Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains. Typical of its kind, it would be concealed in a natural cavern or else cunningly crafted to resemble the surround terrain.</p>
<p>A large spelljammer port called the Dock was operated by the arcane at the center of the largest glacial expanse of the Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Yeti dwelled in Wu Pi Te Shar. Regularly, evil yeti gathered into packs and came down to hunt the people of Tabot, harassing the monasteries and killing or kidnapping lamas .</p>
<p>Atop the Forbidden Plateau stood the Kingdom of Nix , which was home to goblins and harpies .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Shou Year 2339 (1089 DR) , a massive yeti pack hunt known to the Tabotans as the Kume Sa Yeti descended from Wu Pi Te Shar to raid Frekang Gompa . The yeti slew or carried off 280 lamas of the gompa's 400-strong population.</p>
<p>In Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) , the yeti emerged from Wu Pi Te Shar once again to raid Nafeen Gompa , killing 23 and causing great damage. Some Tabotans feared the coming of another Kume Sa Yeti, and the authorities in Thok organized a hunting expedition against them.</p>
