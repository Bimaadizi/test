<p>Witchcap toadstools were a variety of fungus that were found in the Feywild .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These mushrooms were quite broad, wider across than they were tall. Even then, they could grow nearly as tall as humanoid figure.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the fomorian king Malabog conquered an expanse of the Feywild and twisted the land to better suit his own desires. He ordered the fomorian witches of his army to plant witchcap toadstools along a great river, transforming it into a twisted swamp known as the Putrid Fen .</p>
<p>In response, Kehl Skywatcher of New Sharandar hired adventurers to set many of the large mushrooms aflame, in order to remove their taint on the natural world.</p>
