<p>The Cephalopolop was a renegade kraken who was the secret ruler of Sloopdilmonpolop in 1370 DR . and 1372 DR</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Despite its small size as a kraken, the Cephalopolop compensated with cunning, secrecy and ambition.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Cephalopolop was a kraken from the seas of the surface until it arrived in Sloopdilmonpolop, where in time it assumed secret control of the kuo-toa .</p>
<p>For a long time, Cephalopolop plotted against a kraken that ruled the seas off the coasts of Calimshan . In 1363 DR , the Cephalopolop's plans were weakened when, in the Nelanther Isles , a third kraken killed and replaced the dragon turtle known as the Curse of Irphong . Now with two potential rivals, the Cephalopolop became more cautious.</p>
<p>By 1370 DR, its puppet was the Priest-King Dagagoorg , who believed the Cephalopolop was an incarnation of Blibdoolpoolp .</p>
