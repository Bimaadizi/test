<p>Archer's belts were enchanted belts created by the shamans of the orcish Kingdom of Many-Arrows .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These orcish belts came with two variations of the enchantment—regular archer's belts , and more potent greater archer's belts . The belts possessed magics that made the wearer resistant to piercing missiles and weapons.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Archer's belts were commissioned by the King Obould of the Many-Arrows after his orc archers started getting wounded and losing lives to the archers of Citadel Sundbarr . Orcish shamans started creating these belts for the most distinguished archers and warriors of the Spine of the World . The worthiness of the warriors was determined in contests that, with time, became the height of orcish entertainment. By the late 14 th century DR , many of archer's belts fell into the hands of non-orcs, and were found along the Sword Coast as well as far-away lands of Samarach . One belt could be fun in the Tempest's Fury , a magical conclave of researchers, slaughtered by a rogue djinni in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR .</p>
