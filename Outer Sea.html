<p>The Outer Sea , also known as the Outer Seas or the Great Outer Sea , was a term used to refer collectively to the seas that surrounded the continent of Faer没n . These were the Trackless Sea , which bordered west Faer没n , and the Great Sea that bordered south Faer没n . This served as a contrast to the continent's major inland body of water, the Inner Sea .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Twelfth Ser么s War , a number of ports along the Outer Sea were attacked by the forces of Iakhovas . The war came to an end when the Whirlpool Gate of Myth Nantar was used to expel Iakhovas from the Inner Sea and into the Outer Sea.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Outer Sea shared many of the same sentient races as the Inner Sea, most especially aquatic elves . Other races included merfolk , morkoths , and sahuagins . However, they exhibited a number of sociological and physiological differences from their Inner Sea counterparts.</p>
