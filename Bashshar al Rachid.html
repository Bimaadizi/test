<p>Bashshar al Rachid was a famous collector, merchant, and the wealthiest djinni on Toril in the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Some of the enchanted items offered by Bashshar included a girdle of beatification , wand of trap detection , boots of grounding , bracers of defense , and many others.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , Bashshar was famed as an arrogant and greedy creature. Many stories told about him offering aid to adventurers but always at a steep price. Commonplace for a djinni, Bashshar al Rachid was imprisoned or simply lived inside the avarine decanter made out of blue mithril in the image of Bashshar's dour face. In 1312 DR, the avarine decanter was in the hands of a conniving drow merchant Nym who traveled the frigid north of Icewind Dale . He offered the flask for sale, valued at 3,960 gold coins .</p>
<p>Each individual could activate the avarine decanter's magic three times, summoning Bashshar. Each time, the djinni offered those who summoned him access to his vast collection of magic items for trade, provided healing at a steep price, or asked to be freed from his servitor to the flask.</p>
