<p>In 1371 DR , Terrance Decamber along with other members of his guild attended the wedding of the Open Lord of Waterdeep Piergeiron the Paladinson and Eidola of Neverwinter . The wedding was going to take away from the Master Mariners' Guild's business via a trade agreement between Waterdeep and the Boareskyr family. The Mariners led by Jheldarr Boaldegg plotted to disrupt the event; the guild members set a crossbow trap to fire at the husband and wife during the ceremony. The plan was foiled by a young noble Kastonoph Nesher . Prior to the trap being set, Terrance was killed during a masquerade ball after Piergeiron witnessed the Mariners attempting to murder young Kastonoph.</p>
