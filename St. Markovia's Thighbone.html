<p>Saint Markovia's Thighbone was a remnant of Markovia , the worshiper of Morninglord and the ancient enemy of Strahd von Zarovich .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Saint Markovia's Thighbone was a club made out of the thighbone of the woman who assembled forces and attempted to slay the vampire lord of Barovia . She was defeated and locked in a tomb underneath Strahd's Castle Ravenloft . Markovia's divine blessing remained within her body and eventually empowered her bones.</p>
<p>This thick and sturdy enchanted bone was scribed with holy symbols of several gods.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>St. Markovia's Thighbone had an enchantment that gave the wielder a chance to heal themselves upon a successful strike. Additionally, it randomly placed the death ward spell upon the wielder of the bone club or one of their allies.</p>
<p>Additionally, the thighbone had anti- undead powers, similar to those of maces of disruption .</p>
<p>If this bone mace was used against a vampire or vampire spawn it effectively functioned as a +3 mace of disruption . It it landed a successful hit, St. Markovia's Thighbone disintegrated into dust after the end of the battle.</p>
