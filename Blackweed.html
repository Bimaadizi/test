<p>Blackweed was a highly potent poison known in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In its pure form, it was a pale yellow fluid. A concentrated dose of blackweed poison had a quite a distinct odor,
but it dissolved unnoticeably in water.</p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>A slow-acting poison, following ingestion, blackweed had no immediate effects on a victim. After 12 hours or more, however, they would begin to feel pains, growing from irritating to agonizing. In under 24 hours, the victim would be dead. A small vial of blackweed to sufficient to slay a whole townful of people.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Eleint of the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , the Iron Throne provided two vials of blackweed to two of its spies in Cormyr , king's envoy Grodoveth and Mayor Tobald of Ghars , along with orders to poison the village water supply via its cistern. This was part of a plot to assassinate the visiting Grand Council of the Merchants' Guild of Cormyr—and incidentally the town's entire population—and thereby benefit the Iron Throne's interests in Sembia and fill the vacancies left in Cormyr.</p>
<p>Fortunately, during a medical examination on Eleint 18 , the retired War Wizard Benelaius found the vial in Tobald's cloak , identified it by its odor, cleaned it out, and replaced it with a harmless crystalline powder that glowed in the dark. He had already found and taken Grodoveth's vial when he came across his dead body earlier that day. To confirm his suspicion, he then had junior War Wizard Lindavar test the stolen poison. Lindavar used a centrifuge , together with reagents and an alembic , to examine a sample and identified the blackweed.</p>
<p>At a midnight gathering on Eleint 19 , Benelaius revealed that everyone who had drunk the water of Ghars that day had a glowing mouth, and so exposed Tobald, who'd not touched a drop, as the would-be poisoner.</p>
