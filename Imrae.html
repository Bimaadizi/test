<p>Imrae was a handmaiden of Lolth who lived in Ust Natha around 1368 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was a typical female drow , cruel and ruthless. She would get maddened if spoken to by a male without permission. Imrae believed that foreigners had no place in Ust Natha, and would usually sell them to slavers, or to the tavern for amusement. The handmaiden gave Solaufein a blessed item of Lolth that would pull illithids from their astral travels.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1368 DR , she may have assigned both Solaufein and the party of Gorion's Ward to intercept a group of mind flayers who had captured a matron mother 's daughter, called Phaere .</p>
