<p>Asgetrion the Learned was a local sage who lived in Arabel in Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He was perhaps the most accomplished expert on the study of gorgons in all of Cormyr. Due to the nature of his expertise, Asgetrion owned what some have called the largest collection of scrolls of protection against petrification in the realm. He would never sell his scrolls, but instead hoarded them jealously, sharing only his knowledge for a price. It was this knowledge that brought adventurers and War Mages alike to his home from all over Cormyr and beyond.</p>
