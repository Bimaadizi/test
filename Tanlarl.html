<p>Tanlarl was a kind of aphrodesiac perfume , commonly found in the cities and communities along the Sword Coast .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tanlarl was a greasy ointment of reddish-brown color that turned clear and stopped feeling oily upon contact with the user's skin. Tanlarl had a very peculiar reaction with different types of skin—generally the ointment smelled pleasantly of wood smoke, but on some bodies it lost all smell completely. When applied to most females, tanlarl exuded a smell of mildew, and when applied to most males, it gained a warm, leathery smell that generally proved very attractive to women.</p>
<p>A perhaps unintended side effect of tanlarl was that it acted as an extremely strong aphrodisiac for orcs and half-orcs who happened to smell it.</p>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>It was a popular belief that tanlarl was made from the secretions of rare monsters, but it was actually derived from common vegetable oils , herbs , and oxen livers.</p>
