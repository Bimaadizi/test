<p>Ashenford Torinbow was a bard and a member of the Elder Circle of the Emerald Enclave and a follower of Silvanus .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Early in his life, he was a Harper in Shadowdale in the Dalelands , until the Year of the Adder, 1328 DR , when he was captured and tortured by the Zhentarim . After being rescued, Ashenford left the Harpers and lived for a time in Waterdeep as a bard before relocating to the Vilhon Reach where he joined the Emerald Enclave.</p>
<p>Because of the chaos caused by the Spellplague , which had altered nature's ecosystems and driven Cindermoon , another member of the Elder Circle, mad, the Elder Circle was stagnating in the late 15 th century. However, in the Year of the Nether Mountain Scrolls, 1486 DR , the boy prophet of Lathander , Stedd Whitehorn , arrived and successfully cured Cindermoon.</p>
