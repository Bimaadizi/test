<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , the town of Targos in Icewind Dale became besieged by the Legion of the Chimera. One of the Legion's surprise attacks involved teleporting goblins from underground tunnels into the Targos docks. The next attack came as a direct assault on the town's palisades. Lord Ulbrec Dinnesmore of Targos ordered a group of mercenaries from Luskan to follow two of his scouts, Ennelia and Braston , southeast to the goblin fortress. Vunarg and his tribe resided in the recently erected fort in the frigid Icewind Dale tundra.</p>
<p>Despite having an obligation to be part of the Legion of the Chimera, Vunarg felt mistreated by the horde's orcs and bugbears . The taller humanoids pushed goblins around and withheld food from the Vunarg Clan. The chieftain longed to be home in the plains, where they could hunt and go to war with other clans. However, Vunarg's hate for "bloated townie scum" overpowered his disgruntlement with the orcs and bugbears.</p>
