<p>Athorton was a sage from Nleeth on Vilhon Reach , living in the 13th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Athorton was a young sage in the early 1200s DR.</p>
<p>By the mid–14th century DR , it was theorized that it was Athorton who stole the Tome of Torment —the holiest book of the faith of Ilmater —from the priestess of Loviatar , Lalaskra of Ormpetarr . Lalaskra had worn the hairshirt tome constantly, but removed it during a ritual in the Year of the Crimson Crag, 1211 DR when it was stolen by an unknown thief, who also managed to make off with the tome's covers, stored in a backroom in Lalaskra's quarters in a nearby temple. Incensed, Lalaskra whipped her Loviatan minions into a frantic search for the Tome all across the southern Vilhon Reach lands, though without success.</p>
<p>In later years, Athorton wrote extensively of the magic of the Ilmatari—magic known to few outsiders and widely mocked—and he may have acquired such knowledge via the Tome . As an old man, he became friends with Beromchess Ilthyn , a local priestess of Ilmater. Following Athorton's death in the Year of the Shattered Altar, 1264 DR , Beromchess covertly took the Tome to the House of Holy Suffering in Mussum .</p>
