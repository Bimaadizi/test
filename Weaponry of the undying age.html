<p>The weaponry of the undying age was an array of magical artifacts found in the ruins of Myth Drannor , made by the elves but altered by the Red Wizards of Thay .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These weapons were originally high-quality magical equipment made for the elves and their allies, then imbued with the power of the red dragon dracolich Karliath . They included short and long bows ; throwing daggers , hammers , and axes ; bastard , great , short , and long swords ; light and war hammers ; dwarven , great , hand , and battle axes ; great and small clubs ; and great , heavy , and light crossbows , including repeaters ; light and heavy picks ; light and heavy maces ; and daggers , darts , falchions , handwraps , kamas , khopeshes , mauls , morningstars , quarterstaves , rapiers , scimitars , shurikens , and sickles .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>With some individual variation, the weaponry of the undying age had powerful vorpal qualities and dripped with the burning heat of the dracolich Karliath. The thrown weapons kept their old returning powers for the convenience of the wielder.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These artifacts were originally finely-made weapons of Myth Drannor that survived the destruction of the city, and were sought by the Red Wizards of Droic Orgul to use as a base for more powerful item enchantments. The Red Wizards set up necromantic rituals at an old Cult of the Dragon lair in the ruins, among which was one for 'improving' upon the elven craftsmanship.</p>
