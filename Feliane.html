<p>Feliane was an elf priestess of Eilistraee in Cormanthor and Velarswood in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Feliane was short, smaller than the average drow , and had dark brown hair. She had pale skin, but often rubbed black dye into her skin to simulate the appearance of a drow. She wore fine mail and a round helmet and wielded a thin blade.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1372 DR , Feliane was accompanying Seyll Auzkovyn , Xarra , and Halisstra Melarn to an Eilistraeean dance when Halisstra charmed Feliane, sending her away and killing Seyll.</p>
<p>Halisstra later converted to the worship of Eilistraee and set out with Ryld Argith to find the Crescent Blade in the Cold Field . The two were badly injured but were rescued by Feliane and Uluyara, who had scried them.</p>
<p>In early 1373 DR , Feliane and Uluyara accompanied Halisstra to the Demonweb Pits in order to kill Lolth with the Crescent Blade. The three set up a small shrine to Eilistraee in Lolth's domain. Soon afterwards, the trio confronted Quenthel Baenre and Danifae Yauntyrr . Feliane was killed in the subsequent fight by Jeggred Baenre .</p>
