<p>Yalek Snurd was a spy of the Zhentarim in 1489 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Yalek infiltrated the new faction of the Cult of the Dragon led by Severin Silrajin . In 1489 DR, he was among a Cult contingent sent to establish an alliance with the great dragon Claugiyliamatar of Kryptgarden Forest . He reported to his Zhent masters all that happened and they gave the information to an adventuring party hired to defeat Old Gnawbones.</p>
<p>The adventurers ambushed some stolen cargo guarded by some cultists, one of which was Yalek. They probably identified him thanks to his V-shaped scar and spared him. After the skirmish, he would reveal that the cultists were in search of a magic item, the Green Dragon's Mask , which was in possession of the hobgoblin warlord Garbul .</p>
