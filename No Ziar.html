<p>No Ziar , called the mole , was a male human wu jen who dwelled in the Vorkani Mountains and in the settlement of Pan in Koryo around 1357 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Short-statured and hunch-backed, with a shaved head and such bad myopia that he was always squinting, his nickname was very fitting.</p>
<h2>Equipment</h2>
<p>No Ziar possessed an enchanted walking stick that bestowed an amazing power: the ability to summon and talk to pond turtles.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>He was closely affiliated with the yakuza of Pan , and bore their mark: a small tattoo of a blue feather on the heel of his left hand.</p>
<p>His familiar was a raccoon called Mita , which swelled to twice its natural size in a fight.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Ever greedy, this wu jen was ready to steal whatever he could lay his hands on that had magical powers. He stashed his stolen treasures in a keep located high in the Vorkani Mountains.</p>
<p>No Ziar also brewed potions that transformed people into aquatic creatures. He gained notoriety for tricking helpless people into having a quick meal and changing them into fish, such as tuna or whitefish. It seemed he and his familiar then ate the fish themselves.</p>
