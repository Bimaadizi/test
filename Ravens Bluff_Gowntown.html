<p>The Gowntown neighborhood of Ravens Bluff was a wealthy and important part of the city's Temple District , housing many noble residences. It was among the safest locales in the Bluff, heavily patrolled by the City Watch , with clean walkways and streets, free from the usual hawkers and vendors that could often be found in other quarters. The typical weapon -brandishing adventurers that strolled through other districts in town were notably absent around Gowntown.</p>
<p>The neighborhood garnered its name, "Gowntown", from the great number of priests and clerics found about town, walking to and from their residences and nearby places of worship.</p>
