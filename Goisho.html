<p>Goisho was a town in the kingdom of Koryo in Kara-Tur . It lay at the edge of the foothills of the Vorkani Mountains , beside the Quang Muku Forest , on the Hoparatu River .</p>
<p>For many years, the Hu'i Wing , a massive magical brazier that revealed the future and was one of the most valued relics of Koryo, was the centerpiece of a shrine near Goisho.
