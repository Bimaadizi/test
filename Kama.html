<p>A kama ( sing & pl ) was a type of light, short bladed weapon and farming implement that was most commonly used in or originated from the land of Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The kama was similar in design to a sickle —which is what the word meant in Wa-an —or a small scythe , and bore a strong resemblance to a heavy pick , but without the backside peen. However, unlike sickles these implements had far less curvature to their blade and started out broader at the base before tapering to a sharp tip. This blade was mounted on a straight shaft, about the same size as a handaxe .</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>It took special training to use kama effectively in melee combat, therefore it was considered an exotic weapon. The relatively long, curved blade allowed the kama to be used for trip attacks.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Since the earliest days of warfare, kama were repurposed by Kara-Turan peasants for use in battle as they were forbidden from wielding swords . This usage eventually led to the development of the kusari-gama .</p>
<p>Around the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, a wide variety of different enchanted kama could be found in use around Neverwinter and the wider Sword Coast North .</p>
