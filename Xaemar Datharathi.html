<p>Xaemar Datharathi was a member of the Datharathi chaka of Vaelan in Durpar and a plangent . After becoming a plangent, he was often puppeteered by his father, Shaddon Datharathi .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>While an extremely calculating person, he was lampooned in underground plays for his overweening confidence. According to family gossip, he never drank, was celibate, and got on average half a night's sleep per night. He sported a number of crystal prostheses .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Xaemar played a minor role during the meeting that Warian Datharathi attended in 1374 DR , as the nominally presiding member of the meeting. However, he was actually being puppeteered by his father, Shaddon, urging Warian on his behalf to have his grandfather check up on any changes on his prosthetics. Zeltaebar Datharathi had noticed that his siblings, both Xaemar and Sevaera Datharathi , often manifested a different personality. After the meeting that day, Xaemar was possessed while talking to Zeltaebar.</p>
<p>Xaemar perished after the sealing of Pandorym in Tarsakh 19 of that year, alongside all of the senior members of the Datharathi.</p>
