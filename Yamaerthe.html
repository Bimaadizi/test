<p>Yamaerthe was the name used for reference by a drow infiltrator in Scornubel who replaced the owner of Chasper's Trading Tower for some time in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>While disguised as part of her infiltration, Yamaerthe appeared to be an old, frail human woman.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Yamaerthe conducted herself assuming a businesslike persona while in her disguise, but showed visible annoyance at the suggestion her infiltration was making her less of a drow.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Yamaerthe was able to take on the visage of humans convincingly enough, whether through magic or mundane disguises.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Of note, Yamaerthe had a trap set up with a cushion full of presumably poisonous smoke.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She referred people who needed to speak to her leader to Sarltan .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Dove Falconhand investigated Scornubel while pretending to be a drow trader named Iylinvyx who wanted to unload some glowcap mushrooms and deep wines in exchange for some luxury goods. She was directed to Chasper's Trading Tower after drawing some attention to herself; there, she was able to speak to the owner, who told her to ask Daeraude at Blackmanacles how to find Sarltan, and that Yamaerthe had sent her.</p>
