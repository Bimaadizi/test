<p>Scaletail was the Delzemaeran name for fried snake and lizard meat on a stick. This dish was popular across southern Faer没n in lands that touched the Shining Sea or the Great Sea , but rarely seen farther north than the Calim Desert .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In Delzimmer, scaletail was made from the local and plentiful, hand-sized klonthaer and bharang lizards and the somewhat less plentiful but much larger mushroom snake . The heads, tails, and extremities were cut off, the guts removed, and the remainder was flayed and filleted into strips and mounted on skewers . These skewers were either deep fried in spiced oils for immediate consumption, or smoked and dried for trail rations or snacks. Scaletail was often served on platters smothered in sakra or mlael , the local spicy brown sauces.</p>
<p>A full skewer typically cost three copper pieces from a street vendor, while a platter-full of skewers could be had for a silver piece . Use of more exotic reptile meats tripled the price.</p>
