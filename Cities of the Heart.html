<p>They lay at the center of the continent of Zakhara geographically, but even more so in importance. They contained the largest population of any Zakharan region, and while Wasat 's and Halwa 's role was mainly to connect the cities to each other and with the wild hinterland of the Haunted Lands , respectively, Hiyal was the continent's largest industrial center, and Golden Huzuz not only functioned as the capital from which the Grand Caliph ruled all of Zakhara, but was its historical, religious, and cultural center as well.</p>
