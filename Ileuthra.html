<p>Ileuthra was a celestial great wyrm brass dragon who served the god Oghma , Lord of Knowledge, in his plane , the House of Knowledge .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ileuthra was a very ancient dragon, and legends said that Ileuthra lived for a time with Oghma , the god of knowledge.</p>
<p>According to the legend, Ileuthra adored the game of chess and became so great at it that there came a time when no mortal players could provide him with enough of a challenge for a decent game. Finally, Ileuthra challenged Oghma himself to a match of three gamesâ€”and handily defeated the god each time. Unusually, though brass dragons were known to be braggarts, Ileuthra instead politely thanked Oghma and offered to then play a game of the god's choice. It seems instead that Oghma raised Ileuthra as a minor servant of his.</p>
<p>For his experience, he was chosen to represent his kind in Protanther 's council to discuss the menace of the Cult of the Dragon and Tiamat in the 1480s DR . He heeded the call and came to the council with no predetermined position, and would consider all sides in the debate and consider all proposed plans. However, he did think the dragon masks were too dangerous if left where humanoids might find them. A band of adventurers sent by the Council of Waterdeep convinced him to ally with the humanoid races to stop the Cult's plot; Ileuthra decided they were reliable and capable of leading the alliance.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Having watched them for centuries, Ileuthra saw the potentials for good and evil as existing in equal measure among the lesser races and in each individual. He believed that it was individuals that made the difference between victory and defeat, and a trustworthy individual could be followed, even by dragons.</p>
<p>Though he was known to dwell in Oghma's realm, Ileuthra was evasive about this when asked.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He was always hunting for knowledge and for more challenging games. He wandered the planes in his research.</p>
<p>Ileuthra and Oghma continued to play chess, and Ileuthra continued to win.</p>
