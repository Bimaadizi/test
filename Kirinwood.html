<p>Kirinwood was a large village on the coast of Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Kirinwood was located on the north bank of the Kirinar Stream that flowed into the River Mistwater and the Dragonmere . It was inside a tiny forest of the same name that sheltered the village from strong coastal winds, and east of nearby bogs.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The village was strongly influenced by a druidic circle called the Talkers to the Trees , which oversaw the surrounding forest and strictly regulated what could be harvested from it.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The village lay in the agricultural heartlands of Cormyr amid a small wood tended by druids, making Kirinwood an excellent place to buy crops in bulk or seek guidance on matters of forestry. It had three mills that processed oats , corn , wheat , and the farmer's market brought alfalfa , fruit , poultry , and eggs from surrounding farms. Nearby orchards supplied plentiful apples , while the bogs the west yielded blueberries and raspberries harvested with the aid of gawl crawlers .</p>
<p>The village made and sold a lot of fern-and-mint wine that cleared the throat and tasted like spruce bark. They also made a fiery mushroom ale and a famous mushroom gravy that was sent all across Cormyr and the Dragon Coast , both of which sold for 5 sp per hand keg.</p>
<p>Fine white sand was gathered from ridges north of Kirinwood and used in glassworking at Galandor's Glassworks . This workshop made exceptionally fine glass objects, from simple marbles to finely-ground lenses and complex sculptures, and had customers from around the Sea of Fallen Stars .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Kirinar noble family made their home in remote Kirinwood, and Ardest Kirinar founded a wizard's school to win some influence and fame in the realm. His plans came to ruination when competing mages broke into a fierce spell battle that wiped out his student body, his whole family, and the lower levels of his estate-turned-school. The "Tower That Will Not Fall" continued to hover in place regardless, becoming a local attraction that was regularly checked by Purple Dragons to ensure nothing dangerous took up residence.</p>
