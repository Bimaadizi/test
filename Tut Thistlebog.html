<p>Tut Thistlebog was a wino and a confidant of Nine-Fingers Keene of the Guild in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tut was a halfling man of fair skin, blonde hair, and brown eyes. Most of the time when he was seen at the Guild's Guildhall, he was quite drunk and more than happy to brag about his friendship with Nine-Fingers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tut Thistlebog gained Nine-Fingers Keene's ear many years before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . By some accounts, Tut rescued Keene back when she was a mere child. Some of those who knew of that unlikely friendship supposed that the Guildmistress picked Tut as her confidant because of the halfling's heavy wine drinking. Tut believed that Keene was a master strategist and did not miss an opportunity to praise her and talk about her plants to handle the Guild's enemies, even when talking in response to a query about whether Tut ate his friend's â€“ Phostlethwaite 's pickled ooze . When the Stone Lord began threatening the Guild, wine-soaked Tut was sure to drunkenly get himself in trouble and try to take on the enemy himself. Nine-Fingers ordered Phostlethwaite to keep Tut busy, drunk, and away from stupid discussion.</p>
<p>When it was revealed that the Stone Lord was none other than Minsc , a personal friend of Baldur's Gate's High Harper , Tut Thistlebog may have revealed Nine-Fingers Keene's plans to ambush her enemy in the Counting House 's vault to the group of adventurers known as the Absolute Adversaries .</p>
