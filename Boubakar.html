<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1355 DR , the self-styled king of Muktar , Hetep , started a war against Golconda. In 1358 DR, during a war council, Boubakar reported to King Samakay that one of his men had discovered that Hetep' battle plans were hidden in the small keep of Fort Blood . Boubakar convinced the king that they needed to send a small party to recover the papers in order to win the war, despite Count Belim 's objections. Samakay hired an adventuring party well-known to him to resolve the matter.</p>
<p>After the surprise death of King Samakay without an heir, Boubakar presented a parchment signed by King Samakay on his deathbed that nominated the adventurers as temporary commanders of Golconda's army until a new king was crowned. Thanks to this, Golconda defeated Muktar's troops for good at the Battle of the Wilma Pass .</p>
