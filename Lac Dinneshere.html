<p>Lac Dinneshere ( pronounced : / l ɑː k ˈ d ɪ n ɛ ʃ ɪər / lack DIN-eh-sheer ) was one of the three lakes of Icewind Dale in the Frozenfar of the Sword Coast North that the Ten Towns clustered around. It was smaller and more shallow than Maer Dualdon , and had choppy waters thanks to the bitter winds that blew down from Kelvin's Cairn .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Most of the shoreline of Lac Dinneshere was rocky bluffs and barren tundra. All year round, the waters of Lac Dinneshere were cold enough to kill in minutes anyone entering the lake.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The lake earned its name from its first human settlers, the noble Dinev family of Cormyr . After leaving their home kingdom sometime before the late 11 th century DR , they built their new familial keep on the banks of Knucklehead Harbor .</p>
<p>In the 12 th century, the warrior Aihonen slayed the white dragon Icasaracht on the banks of Lac Dinneshere. Both the dragon and the warrior died in the battle, and Icasaracht sank beneath the lake's icy waters.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Lac Dinneshere was one of three known places where the knucklehead trout live, the other two being the lake of Maer Dualdon and Redwaters . A rarely-seen community of aquatic elves resided in the depths of Lac Dinneshere. Their reclusiveness led to many to believe that they were merely one of the local myths intended to draw traders and settlers to the region. However, one of the lake's aquatic elves made contact with a group of adventurers and a fisher in the town of Easthaven in the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The sword of the hero Aihonen possessed powerful enchantments when it was wielded within a "dragon's flight" of Lac Dinneshere.</p>
<p>The Lac Dinneshere was haunted by a ghost of a woman known as the White Lady . The Lady died while her husband was away, amassing a fortune for their shared future, and after her death, appeared at shore of the lake where they first met.</p>
