<p>The mirror of perfection was a magic item in Koryo in northeast Kara-Tur .</p>
<p>Around 607 DR , the mirror of perfection was hidden in the Caves of Ghazz on the island of Saishu off the coast of Koryo.</p>
<p>It was thought to still be there by 1357 DR , but the exact location of the caves was unknown. This was one of the local legends that Dan Zor , the former king and governor of Saishu, wished to investigate. By 1357 DR, he sought adventurers who would seek out the caves for him.</p>
