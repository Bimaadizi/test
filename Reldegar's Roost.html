<p>Reldegar's Roost was a rough tavern and inn located in the Sembian city of Yhaunn , owned by the retired sailor Barnacle Bill .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The establishment was found on the city's docks, where desperate sailors might easily find it.</p>
<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
<p>Reldegar's was a filthy and poorly maintained place that permanently smelled of rum , with almost everything inside it stained or scarred. The furniture was universally made of thick, durable wood. Bill didn't tolerate any horseplay and kept the peace with a hefty club with a bronze head, which was kept mounted with hooks above the bar below a sign stating "No Fighting! Take it Outside!"</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Roost was considered perhaps the worst establishment in Yhaunn, with its only saving grace being its low prices. Bill stayed out of his customer's business whenever possible, focusing on food, drink, and lodgings over any rumor-mongering or gossip-brokering.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 1360s DR, adventurers on a treasure hunt encountered the pirates Rufus the Cruel and Malificat at the Roost, as well as the Cormyrean privateers Seldar and Throxis .</p>
