<p>Darrigo Trumpettower was a nobleman of Athalantar in the 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>He had a bristling moustache. By 234 DR , he had come to rely on a cane.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The man was brave and lusty.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was the uncle of Peeryst Trumpettower and an elder of the Trumpettower family. He had been married at least twice; his second wife liked violent foreplay. He had no allegiance to King Belaur Aumar or the Magelords of Athalantar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Darrigo had gotten married for the first time in the "Year of the Gorgon Moon", having been sober for that marriage. No such year existed in the Roll of Years .</p>
<p>On 229 DR , the elder Trumpettower was downstairs from the bridal suite after the marriage of Peeryst, his nephew, and Nanue Glarmeir , his bride. He mistook some of the noises caused by an invasion of the Moonclaws thieving gang invading their suite for possible play from the newlyweds, but eventually heeded a cry for help, and if a little slowly, he came to their aid. He quickly removed the thieves from the suite upon arrival.</p>
<p>By 234 DR , Darrigo had become a farmer, and come to use a cane; the sorceress Myrjala Talithyn was cornered by armsmen on that year in his farm, where armsmen got in despite his objections. A priestess of Mystra called Elmara (who was actually the disguised prince Elminster Aumar ) then came by; he tried to bar her way, warning her that the armsmen were bloodthirsty, but she went around him and disabled them, rescuing Myrjala. he received a handful of gems from her, and afterwards, when a final armsman tried to kill her after surviving her attack, Darrigo finished him off.</p>
<p>Darrigo Trumpettower finally took the side of the rebel Knights of Athalantar openly, once they stormed the castle as part of Prince Elminster Aumar 's attempt to overthrow his uncle, Belaur Aumar , the king, after Nanue was injured by a recklessly charging Jansibal Otharr 's sword; he told Peeryst to bind her wounds and pursued Jansibal. After a Knight slew Jansibal, Darrigo recognized Helm Stoneblade , and decided to stand with them, immediately turning on Thelorn Selemban , who had tried to help him with Jansibal Otharr.</p>
<p>His cheek was sliced in combat soon after; he would pay with his life soon enough.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>It was said that Darrigo Trumpettower had hurled all of the Moonclaws thieves out of his nephew's bridal suite while the newlyweds consummated without noticing the tumult, which was an embellishment.</p>
