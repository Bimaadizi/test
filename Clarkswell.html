<p>Clarkswell was a small farming town in northern Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Clarkswell laid fifty miles north of Arabel , in the foothills of the Storm Horn Mountains , and sustained itself on farming. Clarkswell was a small town of only several businesses and little trade to speak of.</p>
<p>The Town Square laid at the village's center, on Market Way . A smithy, stables, and a general store surrounded the Town Square. The Cooked Goose Inn stood on the crossing of Market Way and Lynway , just to the north, facing the Town Square. Further north, the next block was separated by Merdocks Street . This was where the leather goods store was found with the mage protector's tower across the street crossing. One block south from the Town Square stood the town's guardhouse and the mayor's manse.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The town was governed by a mayor. Two other officials were the protector mage and the guard captain. Gladgo Haltok , a retired adventurer , was the kindly, well-liked lord-mayor in the mid-14 th century DR . During the same time period, the title of the guard captain was held by Lyle Grobit , an immensely strong but moody fighter . And lastly, Eloras was the town's introverted protector mage.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Under guard captain Lyle Grobit's leadership, the town's guard company consisted of forty fighters and sixty trained civilian militiamen. Twenty of the guards were usually on patrol at the time.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Protector mage Eloras saved Clarkswell from monsters on three separate occasions before or in the mid-14 th century DR. In the mid-14 th century DR, a farmstead ten miles north of town was hit by a hill giant raid. Another event of note was a robbery of the lord-mayor's manse and the mage protector's tower by a group of adventurers who pretended to be members of the nobility but, in truth, sought an acceptance into Brandon's Band of Thieves of Arabel.</p>
