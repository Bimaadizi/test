<p>Gloamings were a variety of planetouched creatures with heritage from both Toril and the Plane of Shadow .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gloamings were humanoid in form, with dark-furred wings and pale, bioluminescent skin; they could control the brightness of their skin, changing between none at all, through levels of dimness, up to blindingly bright. Their eyes were grey, green-grey, blue-grey, or violet-grey in color, and often described as "cat-like" due to their oval pupils and tapetum lucidum (that is, the eyes reflect light). In dim light, the eyes appear metallic in color. The fine fur on a gloaming's wings could be black, dark brown, or dark grey. The wing fur was thick and had an especially notable gloss at the tips and at the base.</p>
<p>Most gloamings had one or more tattoos, which created differently-shaded or lit patterns on their luminescent skin. They ranged in height from 2 ft 6 in (0.76 m) to 3 ft (0.91 m), and weighed about 25 lb (11 kg).</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>As a group, gloamings were curious and prided themselves on their individuality-or perhaps their contrariness, for the alignment of any given gloaming almost always was something other than the dominant alignment of the region they were in. For example, a chaotic evil gloaming would not be found in a chaotic evil settlement, but gloamings of most other alignments might be found there. And in a predominantly neutral region, the gloamings there will be of extreme alignments (the corners of the alignment grid).</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The gloaming race had several innate abilities, including their bioluminescent skin and low-light vision , but they suffered light blindness in bright light. They could fly, with only average maneuverability. They also had a minor talent for shadow-based illusion spells; they were also resistant against the use of such spells on them. Interestingly, gloamings were sensitive to the presence of nearby portals, and they were majorly resistant to psionics .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Although settlements were rare due to gloamings' wanderlust, gloaming settlements tended to run contrary to the dominant alignment of the area. They shunned all organized religion.</p>
<p>Gloamings detested drow , sharing legends that told of drow capturing, torturing, and experimenting on gloamings. Illithids did not find gloamings palatable and thus left them alone.</p>
<p>Gloamings were uncommon in the Underdark but almost never seen on the surface. A few gloaming settlements existed, such as the large city of Sphur Upra , which straddled the boundary of the Prime Material Plane and the Plane of Shadow.</p>
