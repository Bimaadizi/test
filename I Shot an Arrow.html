<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This rustic tavern was an inexpensive place that was popular with Arrowmark's craftsfolk. It had a quiet and calm atmosphere, the locals quickly ejected any who became too loud or tried to start a brawl. It was not uncommon for a bard to play a harp but the patrons of I Shot an Arrow never sang along or even danced.</p>
