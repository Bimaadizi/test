<p>Psamma was a small town found in western Thindol on the Chultan Peninsula .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Psamma was located along the southern bank of the River Gur .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Psamma was a small and simple trading center. In the Year of the Dragon, 1352 DR , residents of Psamma sunk a new well, revealing a series of underground tunnels that appeared to have been used as tombs by yuan-ti in the past. Explorers retrieved various yuan-ti artifacts, but the officials of Psamma quickly forbade any further delving into the catacombs. Armed guards were stationed at the main entrances, but new yuan-ti artifacts continued to surface from time to time, suggesting that new entrances into the tunnels had been dug.</p>
