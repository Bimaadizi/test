<p>The Skyriders of Aglandar were an order of dwarven knights from the Great Rift in the Shining South . These champions of the dwarven goddess of luck in battle, Haela Brightaxe , were famed for their aerial hippogriff mounts.</p>
<p>While they protected their kin, and defended their homeland from monsters, they seldom traveled far from the Rift. If they did, it was often to pursue threats to the realm or deliver dire messages to allies abroad.</p>
