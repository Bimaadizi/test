<p>Askalath was a mage who once resided on the isle of Askalet in the Sea of Swords , many centuries before the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR, little remained recorded of Askalath's history. Elminster Aumar , the Sage of Shadowdale , believed that the mage's island, Askalet, got its name from a corruption of "Askalath." The mage resided in his tower , long a ruin in the 14 th century DR. By that time, his home was looted of most of the treasures. However, in the tower's basement, one could find a long, seeming infinite well, a shaft that plummeted deep into the bowels of the Undermountain . Cellar complexes were hidden closer to the shaft's end, with entrances accessible from the bottom of the well.</p>
