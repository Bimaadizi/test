<p>Ikemmu , formerly called Sphur Upra , or "Gloaming Home", was a city located in the Middle Underdark . It was unique in that it consisted of portions that existed in both the Underdark and the Shadowfell at the same time. Before the Spellplague , it contained the largest population of gloamings in Faerûn . After the Spellplague, it became the home of the largest collection of shadar-kai in Faerûn.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Ikemmu was located 9 miles (14 kilometers) deep under the surface about 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of the Mountains of Copper under the area between Murghôm and Mulhorand . (This was confirmed by cartographers both before and after the Spellplague, although some have claimed that the city was underneath Aglarond . ) After the Spellplague, it bordered the Ramparts of Night .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The settlement was filled with portals between the Material and Shadow planes , and in later times it served as a major trade point between the planes.</p>
<p>Much of the buildings in the Material side of the city were constructed of obsidian , including the main gate. This stone was mined from deep in the Underdark. Many visitors to the city described it as looking more like a sculpture garden than as a city, as its gloaming architects designed buildings to look like creatures and objects that they had seen on their travels to other places. However, the city lacked color, so the "sculptures" appeared abstract and sullen. On the Shadow Plane, the structures were made of shadowstuff .</p>
<p>Because the city was originally built by cloakers , it was built vertically rather than horizontally. Since shadar-kai can teleport through shadows and cloakers (and gloamings) can fly, the vertical layout of the city was not an inconvenience.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>After the Spellplague, the majority of inhabitants in the Underdark section of the city were humans and dwarves , while only shadar-kai or permanent residents were allowed in the Shadowfell section of the city.</p>
<p>There were many shrines to Tempus and a few to Shar throughout the city, and Ghaunadaur was worshiped in secret by some residents.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>After the Spellplague, the city's ruler was Uwan .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>On the Shadowfell side, the city was protected by a 3‑foot-thick (0.91‑meter) and 30‑foot-high (9.1‑meter) wall made with stone imported from the Material-Plane side.</p>
<p>After the Spellplague, the city's military consisted solely of shadar-kai and was led by Uwan .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Ikemmu was well-situated to exploit trade between the Underdark and the Shadowfell.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>There were four huge towers in Ikemmu: Pyton, Makthar, Athanon, and Hevalor. Tower Makthar was the tower of justice, and it was from the top of this tower that Uwan pronounced judgements. Tower Athanon housed the city's military barracks, and Tower Pyton was the heart of the trading district.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The settlement that would become Ikemmu began as a small community of five gloaming families in the Plane of Shadow in what corresponded to the year −2954 DR . They gathered together at first for mutual protection, but their clan expanded and was joined by other peaceful residents of the Shadowfell.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Spitting Viper, 534 DR , adventurers from Mulhorand who were exploring the Plane of Shadow reached the settlement and offered a diplomatic arrangement to create a portal between the place and Mulhorand. The ruling Family Oligarchy at that time did not accept the treaty, fearing that a portal to Mulhorand would be too dangerous, yet they did find the idea of a portal to elsewhere on the Material Plane fascinating, and the main portal linking the Underdark and the Plane of Shadow was established that same year.</p>
<p>After the Spellplague occurred in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , only cloakers remained in the city, which they called Sphur Upra, which means "Gloaming Home" in their language. Shadar-kai fleeing from Netheril soon settled there among the cloakers, as the gloamings had done, and renamed the city Ikemmu.</p>
<p>The shadar-kai knew little of the former gloaming inhabitants, but the gloamings left behind their strange architecture and statues of their delicate, winged forms portrayed among the cloakers. One of the city's open markets contained an enigmatic archway covered in runes, leading some later visitors to theorize that the former inhabitants indeed escaped the Spellplague to flee to another realm.</p>
