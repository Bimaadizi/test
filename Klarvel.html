<p>Klarvels , or as they were more commonly referred to as, ring-loaves , were a type of lightly sweetened or savory bread that was baked in donut-shaped molds.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Klarvels were ring-shaped loaves of bread made of dark rye . When these were transported, klarvels quickly hardened and dried, becoming rock-hard gray crusts. Hardened klarvels were softened in broth, wine, or water before consumption. Sweet varieties were soaked overnight is sugared alcoholic drinks like mead , wine , or just honey .</p>
<p>Ring-loaves varied in size, depending on the region and the baker. The most traditional breads were between 0 feet and 10 inches (0.25 meters) and 0 feet and 12 inches (0.3 meters) across, and 0 feet and 6 inches (0.15 meters) thick. Breads that were baked for large groups or to be served at events were much larger. However, much smaller-sized klarvel handfoods were baked by hin and gnomes .</p>
