<p>Harps of haunting were harps enchanted with necromantic magics.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These grim musical instruments were carved of old bones with bowstrings of dead adventurers used as harp strings. Their dark nature led many of the owners of harps of haunting to rarely displaying the instruments or using them in public.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Grim or not, harps of haunting were useful magic items. A bard who found themselves in possession of one of these harps could animate dead with several plucks of string, could cause their opponents to scatter in fear , and use the spell scare .</p>
<p>Each harp of haunting held fifty charges. The animate dead spell consumed three charges, fear - two, and scare exhausted a singe charge.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR , several of these turbulent instruments could be found along the Sword Coast and the Moonsea regions. Some well-known bards were seen using these dark instruments against their opponents.</p>
