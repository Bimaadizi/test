<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In the Year of Gilded Sky, −400 DR , Iliphar dared to make camp in the Land of the Purple Dragon; now known as Cormyr . He was spotted by Thauglor, who ruled said land, but respectfully retreated, in awe of the great dragon's speed and grace.</p>
<p>Iliphar's powers in battle earned him the respect of the elven House Amaratharr after defeating the dragonkin of Thauglor on numerous occasions. In the Year of Good Hunting, −205 DR , Iliphar and a small group of elves met with Thauglor and his two young witnesses, the blue Gloriankithsanus and red Mistinarperadnacles , in a parley. Iliphar challenged Thauglor to a Feint of Honor that would become known as The Passing of Power . Thauglor lost and the elves laid claim to the Forest Country .</p>
<p>In the Year of Opening Doors, 26 DR , Iliphar brought his elven court to the settlement of Suzail and organized the coronation of Faerlthann Obarskyr , the first king of Cormyr . He appointed Baerauble Etharr as the advisor to the crown.</p>
<p>The date of Iliphar's death is not known but he died sometime before 900 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Iliphar had a quick wit and came across as fearless.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Iliphar carried a golden staff twisted so it appeared like rope. It was topped by a purple stone carved into the shape of a bird. He wore a sash of various wands in individual sheaths ready for combat. When expecting combat, Iliphar wore a soft green cassock and a dark green cape, threaded with gold and amber . The cape's hem was inset with extremely sharp crystals, so it could be flung towards opponents to cause injury. Beneath this, he wore a silvery mail body suit. Iliphar carried a thin, whip-like blade.</p>
