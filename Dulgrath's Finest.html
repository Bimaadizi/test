<p>Dulgrath's Finest was a variety of exceedingly rare wine made by Baroness Dulgrath of Aglarond in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Baroness Dulgrath attended the year-end celebration festival in the town of Mossbridges in the Vast . She participated in a wine -tasting and competition with her so-called "Dulgrath's Finest," aged in barrels made of enchanted Yuirwood wood. Lady Dulgrath was not a professional vintner and did not export the wine out of Aglarond, but she received many compliments on the drink she created. Dulgrath brought several casks of her wine for the competition but was extremely protective of the batch, refusing to serve Dulgrath's Finest to adventurers. It was unrecorded if Dulgrath's Finest won the competition.</p>
