<p>Nolvur's Manyworks was a former residence in Khôltar , south Faerûn , that had been converted into rental space for offices and workshops, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This building was next door to Hindror House on the northwest side of Orntathtar Way , a short walk from Dubrinlar, the western gate into Khôltar, the Iron City. Starting from Darrusktraal —the duty house and fortress that guarded the gate—and proceeding northeast up Orntathtar Way was the ornately decorated Halamor's Tower , then Hindror House, and then Nolvur's Manyworks. Across the street from Nolvur's was the Malgart House , home of the courts and judiciary, that faced west out of the gate.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Nolvur's Manyworks was a fist (small residential tower) that was shorter than Halamor's Tower and much less gaudy.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Because Halamor was so successful at renting out rooms and floors of his residence to finecrafters (folks who assembled and put the finishing touches on much of the ironmongery produced in the Iron City), Nolvur's Manyworks did the same.</p>
