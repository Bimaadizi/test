<p>High Huntsman Pleufan Trueshot was an elder moon elf healer and priest of Solonor Thelandira that presided over the Hall of the High Hunt in Evereska in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He had a calm and soothing presence that he maintained even when conversing with non- elves .</p>

<p>He invited half-elves and humans , all faithful of Solonor and many of them Harpers and Heralds of Faer√ªn , to visit the Hall of the High Hunt and venerate Solonor at any time. Many of the Evereskan moon elf nobility were so shocked by this they relocated their estates to the other side of the valley.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Pleufan was ancient for an elf, and was reputed to have hunted in the Far Forest when it covered most of the Backlands .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Pleufan and his fellow priests tended to elves of the Tomb Guard that encountered a group of phaerimm beneath the Greypeak Mountains . After tomb guardian Takari Moonsnow was injected with a phaerimm larva, Huntsman Trueshot learned the process of its removal, that is, by excision of the juvenile grub.</p>
