<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kalib hailed from the Orsraun Mountains in Turmish , born into a dwarvish mining clan. His father was a traditionalist and left little option for his son, insisting on Kalib becoming a miner too. It was not to be. Still young and rebellious, Kalib Goldweaver followed his dream of sailing the seas. After thirty-nine years spent with his clan in the Orsraun Mountains, Kalib found the courage to disobey his father's will. The aquamarine-eyed dwarf left on bad terms, and not a single member of the clan nor his family wished him well on the upcoming journey.</p>
<p>He found his destiny in a small port town in the Vilhon Reach , where he took his first swim in the waters of the Sea of Fallen Stars . That memory would be held dear by the aged dwarf. At the port, Kalib sought for a ship or a boat to work aboard of. That time was a struggle for the young man, and he faced much coldness and cruelty from other sentient species of the region. None took the dwarf's dream of the sea seriously. Eventually, he found a job as a cabin boy aboard a galleon called The Wanderer .</p>
<p>Kalib Goldweaver's time on The Wanderer brought yet more challenges. The galleon's captain was a cruel man who was delighted to assign all the most deadly and dangerous jobs to the strange dwarf. Kalib never complained and completed every single task with pride. He especially found joy in cleaning off branches from the ship's hull while hanging upside down as the vessel moved through the waves. Kalib spent seven years aboard The Wanderer yet made little friends. In the seventh year, he faced his first pirate attack. Many of his co-workers were butchered in the attack. Kalib fell to his knees and prayed to any dwarvish god who would hear his plea in terror. The dwarf prayed for courage, and Muamman Duathal answered. Empowered by the prayer, Kalib charged to save the surviving sailors. He rushed through a pirate mage 's web spells unrestrained and eventually saved the day.</p>
<p>After the battle, Muamman Duathal appeared to Kalib Goldweaver in a bolt of lightning. The deity tasked Kalib with aiding travelers in need and promised to help the dwarf to find his true home. The avatar presented him with a holy symbol of Muamman Duathal and a handful of beads, one for each pirate slain by the dwarf, dipped in their blood. The deity commanded Kalib to braid them into his beard and to add a bead for each life he would take in the future. This penance was to serve as a way to save souls lost to corruption and evil. Each bead would compile the souls to follow Kalib into the afterlife once his time came to leave.</p>
<p>With the cruel captain's death in the raid, sailors proclaimed Kalib Goldweaver the new captain of The Wanderer . The dwarf was wise to know he did not have enough experience to command such a vehicle and assigned a temporary captain to take the helm until he was ready. Subsequently, Kalib left the The Wanderer in the port of Ravens Bluff, guided by rumors that dwarves once ruled it a century prior. He decided to practice his priestly duties serving the numerous adventurers who operated from the City of Ravens. He adventured alongside others, made many friends, and gained renown through many feats and slayings of drow , dragons , and demons . When he grew in power and acclaim, Kalib Goldweaver was ready to claim the title of the captain of The Wanderer .</p>
<p>One adventure of note took place in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR . It included Kalib Goldweaver and several other adventurers being sent back in time to retrieve a certain book from a dwarven Brightsword Clan . Kalib was inspired by the clan's unity and bravery in the face of certain looming death at the hands of an invading drow army. Kalib Goldweaver swore to see the Clan Brightsword shine again after their return to his time. For the next year and more, Kalib worked tirelessly in restoring the dwarven clan's good name and restoring its glory, following a rescue of some of the clan's children and females using time magics. During that year, Kalib met another dwarf who shared his goals – Uldred Deepaxe , and the two soon became close friends, bonding over the Clan Brightsword.</p>
<p>By Alturiak of the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Uldred was made a Thane of the temple complex at Brightsword Keep , and Kalib was named his loyal advisor and the Chief Prelate.</p>
<p>In or shortly before Uktar - Nightal of 1371 DR, a wedding took place in the Brightsword Keep, officiated by Kalib Goldweaver. Uldred Deepaxe wed Cherrian Waraxe , one of the Brightsword Clan's women rescued from the past a year prior. The wedding was reported on by Fred Faber , the Ravens Bluff Trumpeter 's editor-in-chief.</p>
