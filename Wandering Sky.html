<h2>History</h2>
<p>The saga of the Wandering Sky was famous among the Reghedmen of the north as a tale of hearth and home, advertising the strength of barbarian spirit. The story of the blade began with the Arakon the Arch-Mage's conquest of Icewind Dale , many centuries before the 13 th century DR . The stout Reghedmen Tribe of the Bear was among the first to clash with the Arch-Mage's legions. The barbarian warriors fought bravely but were overwhelmed. Hreidgar, one of the Tribe of the Bear's strongest warriors and hunters, survived the clash after being knocked unconscious. When he came to it, Hreidgar was surrounded by the broken bodies of his tribesmen and ice-cold rain plastering the battlefield. Unable to find his wife and children, Hreidgar followed Arakon's legions with only the Wandering Sky greatsword at his side.</p>
<p>Hreidgar subsequently joined the army of the legendary shaman Jerrod , who united barbarian Reghedmen and Uthgardt tribes against Arakon the Arch-Mage. With Jerrod's armies, Hreidgar wielded Wandering Sky in countless battles and in the historic clash against Arakon's summoned Nine Hells armies. The Wandering Sky howled like the wind, cutting down Hreidgar's enemies until Arakon's crusade was broken. Yet no signs of Hreidgar's family ever surfaced.</p>
<p>The greatsword accompanied Hreidgar's search for his missing family for many years following Arakon's defeat, across the Reghed Glacier during the Season of Raining Spears , and across the Sea of Moving Ice , with the sea-fairing Tribe of the Great Whale . The Wandering Sky cut down through southern slavers as the barbarian traveled to the town of Enholm's Point , where the greatsword was wielded against the armies of Kresselack the Black Wolf. Legends claimed that Hreidgar fought so valiantly that the warlord retreated from Enholm's Point and the field of battle after dealing Hreidgar a grave injury.</p>
<p>Skald sang of gravely wounded Hreidgar traveling for many miles with only his greatsword at his side before he collapsed and died of his injuries. With his final ounces of strength and dying breath, the barbarian plunged the sword into ice and uttered, "Let the sky wander, for my travels are done." The next day, good folk from the village of Enholm's Point came to claim the hero's body, but the Wandering Sky was gone.</p>
<p>Legends said that the Wandering Sky did just that, wandered the skies and found its way into the hands of those embarking on long and dangerous journeys.</p>
<p>Sometime before Mirtul of the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , the Wandering Sky found its way to the Gallaway Trade Depot . The greatsword ended up being available for purchase from Deirdre Gallaway in her trading company's store in Targos the same year.</p>
