<p>Sheikh Didaji was a leader of one of the Bedine tribes that lived in Anauroch during the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was a rather tall man, with sunken, angular features. Due to the fact the men of his tribe covered their faces rather than the women, Didaji wore a scarf around his face that he wore along with the typical turban .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Uncharacteristically of a Bedine sheikh, Didaji was wholly supportive of the sorceress Ruha in the use of her arcane powers. Unlike others he felt it was a blessing from the gods, rather than a curse.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Didaji and his tribe's warriors were among those present during the final battles between the Bedine people and the Zhentilar army that took place in the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR . They helped route the asabi mercenaries from their tunnel system in the south of the Wall of Fallen Djinn mountain range in the Battle of the Fissures , and served as a reserve force alongside the Raz'hadi during the siege of Orofin .</p>
