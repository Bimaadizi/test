<p>Sherrod Starym was an elven wizard of Myth Drannor 's House Starym who visited Eveningstar in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sherrod had tanned skin and shoulder-length white hair swept back.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Shadovar activities after the Shadovar invasion of Wheloon , Oriphaun Huntsilver spied upon them in the Storm Horns . Archwizard Amskar captured him and took him into captivity, leading to his Harper allies throwing their efforts into tracking him down, rescuing him, and undoing the Netherese schemes.</p>
<p>To aid these efforts, they called in an old favor with the Myth Drannan mage Sherrod, who arrived in Eveningstar to lend his expertise. By the simple expedient of checking where he couldn't scry , he deduced that Oriphaun was exceptionally well protected and hidden inside Rungnir's glacier . The Shadovar operation was also well warded, though not even their best work could hide the growing power of their recovered mythallar . With the approval of the Harpers, Sherrod sent a team into the mountain glacier to find Oriphaun and fight the Netherese.</p>
<p>The grand project turned out to be an entire flying enclave , armed to wage war upon Cormyr . The Harpers managed to rescue Oriphaun, slay Archwizard Amskar, and destroy the enclave's flight pillars, sending it careening into a mountainside. Sherrod was suitably impressed by their report when they returned.</p>
