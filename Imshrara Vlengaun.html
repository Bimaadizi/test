<p>Chalice Supreme Imshrara Vlengaun was an ambitious priestess of the church of Loviatar and the successor to High Temptress Endreira Chathlass . Though she took control of the Faith of Pain—and the relic known as the Lash of Loviatar —in the Year of the Vigilant Familiar, 848 DR , her reign lasted only two years before she was assassinated, leading the Loviatans into a decade of instability.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The Chalice of the Faith was largely characterized by an imprudence that ultimately tempered her zeal and determination. Though she exhibited a religious fervor comparable to that of her predecessor, she did not share Endreira's vulpine wits.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Among Imshrara's most valuable possessions was the Lash of Loviatar , which she believed was proof of her authority to lead the Loviatans. The powerful relic remained close at hand even after her death, being sealed away alongside her corpse, but it was eventually stolen from her.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Imshrara assumed leadership of the Church of Loviatar following the death of her infamous predecessor, who had spent the past seventy years spreading the worship of Loviatar across Faerûn . Though she declared the Lash of Loviatar the most sacred relic of their faith in the Year of the Empty Throne, 850 DR , her short tenure as Chalice Supreme culminated in her mysterious assassination; she was found, strangled in her private chambers, by a roper , one believed to have been smuggled into her quarters.</p>
<p>Though the Holy Guard succeeded in killing the creature, Imshrara was already dead. Her body, alongside the roper’s, was displayed before the senior priestesses before both were sealed in chambers and left to decay, untouched, for over a decade. During the chaos that followed her death, the Lash of Loviatar vanished, though this was not widely known until the Year of the Snow Rose, 862 DR , when Kathlathtra Roultym emerged as the new High Holy Temptress and attempted to have Imshrara's remains properly buried in Undelos ' High House of Pain , within a black catafalque made of stone.</p>
