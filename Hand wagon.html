<p>The hand wagon was an experimental non- magical person-propelled wagon developed by Nadul Da Roni .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wagon was a manually-operated wheeled conveyance vaguely similar in form to a gondroller . The rider sat atop it and pulled down on a pair of handles connected to the axle via a pulley and line, using their upper-body strength and weight to propel the wagon along.</p>
<p>The hand wagon was exhausting to operate for more than a few minutes, with few having the strength and stamina to continually pull the handles. It was slowed considerably by any extra weight (such as cargo or passengers) and had to be pushed across bumpy ground or up inclines of more than 5 degrees.</p>
<p>Despite the faults, there was no risk of immolation while operating it, unlike the furnace wagon.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue offered the hand wagon built by Nadul Da Roni, though the price was not made available.</p>
