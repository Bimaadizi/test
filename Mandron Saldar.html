<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He was a guard in Castle Obarskyr .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Rorskryn Mreldrake fled Castle Obarskyr through a portal to Marsember , transformed into a woman, he was spotted at the portal by the War Wizard Ellard Gauntur , who'd been deployed to capture him. Ellard figured out that was Mreldrake transformed from a stain on his clothes, and pursued.</p>
<p>Two sentries stayed on the Marsember side of the portal so that Mreldrake could not return easily: Berent Thallowood and Mandron Saldar. While the two sentries speculated, the vampire archmage Manshoon sent after them the death knight Targrael ; she quickly slew Berent without him even noticing, and then took out Mandron Saldar shortly after. The man confirmed to her that he was Saldar, and she'd killed Thallowood moments prior.</p>
