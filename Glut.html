<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late-15 th century DR , duergar stormed Glut's home and killed his fellow myconids. Glut claimed to have sang to another myconid sovereign, Spaw , in order for assistance, but Spaw was unwilling.</p>
<p>As a sovereign without a circle, Glut wandered the Underdark to find a new myconid colony. The once-sovereign found a new circle of myconids in the Underdark located beneath the Western Heartlands, however, they did not welcome Glut. Glut wished to somehow become the sovereign of this colony, and wanted to prove himself by cleansing the duergar "rot". After his plan to kill the local duergar, he planned to take down the existing myconid sovereign, Spaw, and begin a new age, where he would rule.</p>
