<p>Kesymys was an elf ghost in Cormanthor .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kesymys was a priest of Labelas Enoreth in Cormanthor.</p>
<p>In 1344 DR , at the start of the Retreat , Kesymys agreed to remain in Faerûn to protect the Eventide Abbey like Meira Faerenduil . Like her, her oath was so strong that, after the natural end of her life, Kesymys rose as a ghost to continue to protect the ruins of the abbey, but she became trapped in a mural.</p>
<p>She remained in that state until circa 1486 DR when she met an adventuring party hired by Elanil Elassidil trying to bring peace to Meira's spirit. The ghost was curious about the world in this new era.</p>
