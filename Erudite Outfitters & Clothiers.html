<p>Erudite Outfitters & Clothiers was a modest clothier and tailor shop that did business with the Seekers and the Avowed of Candlekeep , the library-fortress on the Sword Coast .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Erudite Outfitters & Clothiers stood in the Court of Air of Candlekeep, across the courtyard from the House of the Binder , next to the Emerald Door that separated the fortress from its courtyard.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Feldmar Bisset III , the shopkeeper in the late 15 th century DR , catered to the Seekers and the Avowed who sought to purchase new scholarly robes or patch and mend their old garb.</p>
<p>In addition to the tailoring service, Feldmar gave classes on simple stitching and patchwork to reduce the amount of simple work that the shop got from the monks.</p>
<p>Lastly, Feldmar's hobby was raising silkworms in the shop's atrium. He harvested silk from the worms to weave his own precious cloth.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Feldmar Bisset III, a Gondar acolyte, and his family had carved a place for themselves amongst the Avowed, making garments on request.</p>
