<p>Cardinal was a gelding that was stabled in the town of Parnast for a time during the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the mid-1360s DR, Cardinal along with five other horses, Bandy , Ebony , Fowler , Hopper , were being kept the traveling company of Druhallen , Galimer , the guardswoman Rozt'a , and the young rogue named Tiep . Cardinal himself served as the regular mount for the charismatic Galimer.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , the group traveled through the Greypeak Mountains on an expedition that proved disastrous for some of their party. Cardinal was walking down the mountain path leading down towards the bog in the center of the mountains, when he got poor footing and fell into a steep-sided gorge. Druhallen was forced to climb down and end Cardinal's suffering, and a group of deformed Dekanter goblins feasted upon his remains.</p>
