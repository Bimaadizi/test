<p>Fruits & More was a grocery shop located in the Shutters neighborhood of the Crow's End District of Ravens Bluff in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Fruits & More stood on the very end of the northern side of Karen Court in the Shutters.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Fruits & More specialized on selling sugars , jams , and compotes , making it the closest thing to a grocer in the Shutters. The locals as well as farmers from nearby sold fruits and preserves of their own making at the shop. The items on offer included cordials made right there at Fruits & More by soaking berries in cheap alcohol for months at a time. The cordials' taste was far from reliable, varying from terrible to delicious.</p>
