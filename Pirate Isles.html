<p>The Pirate Isles were a collection of rocky islands that dotted the Sea of Fallen Stars and were inhabited by pirates. There were fifteen named islands but around sixty in total. During the period between the Spellplague of the late 14 th century DR and the Great Rain a century later, the water level of the Sea of Fallen Stars dropped so dramatically that many of the isles merged into a single large island, which was known as Pirate Isle .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The general makeup of the islands was mountainous terrain with high rocky cliffs. This meant that there were not a lot of ports in the Pirate Isles.</p>
<p>The islands that comprised Prespur were not included in the Pirate Isles despite their proximity.</p>
