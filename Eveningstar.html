<p>Eveningstar was a small, unwalled farming town in the Heartlands of Cormyr , the home of the famous temple to Lathander , the House of the Morning . Eveningstar served as a crossroads town, where the High Road met Starwater Road . It was also notable as being the closest town to the infamous Haunted Halls and for its large population of tressym .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This crossroads community was home to craftsmen and farmers. The town proper consisted of about fifty buildings. It was a beautiful place, full of trees and gardens. The sunsets over the Storm Horns in the west were spectacular to behold. Indeed, the whole region around the village was known as the "Evening Lands" in bardic tales and sages' histories.</p>
<p>Eveningstar was a favorite visit of King Azoun IV , and he often came in disguise.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Eveningstar was located roughly 30 miles (48,000 meters) west of Arabel , where the High Road crossed the Starwater River .</p>
<p>It was a pastoral village surrounded by fields and orchards situated in an elbow of the Starwater River just north of the King's Forest (known by locals as the "Shadowood" ) in Cormyr. It stood at the intersection of the High Road, which ran west to High Horn and east to Arabel, and the Starwater Road (known by locals as the " Suzail Road" or "Southrun"), which ran south to the village of Dhedluk in the King's Forest. Immediately to the north of Eveningstar was the Eveningstar Gorge , or the Starwater Gorge. The gorge, formed by the Starwater River as it flowed down from the Storm Horn Mountains , provided relatively easy access to the Helmlands and the Storm Horns and was the only significant break in the limestone Stonecliff that ran from Tyrluk to the west to just short of Arabel. On the river, north of the town, was the mill pond known as Redhand Pool .</p>
<p>The community had a shared, stone-walled grazing area for their sheep and cattle known as the High Pasture.</p>
<p>Fishing was popular off the Starwater bridge , and the river also had several swimming holes that were commonly used by caravanners for bathing.</p>
<p>The weather in the gorge was prone to fogs.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>Eveningstar had a rather large population of semi-feral flying cats , known as tressym, who spend most of their time hunting in the fields around the town. The townsfolk treated the mischievous fluffy winged cats kindly, and Lord Winter and Maea Dulgussir each even had a tressym as a familiar .</p>
<p>During particularly severe winters, wolves from the Stonelands sometimes come down into the gorge to hunt. Their howls can be heard year-round at night.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR , the town was ruled by Lord Tessaril Winter . While Tessaril ruled in name, her fierce loyalty to her close friend King Azoun IV meant that he was truly the one in power. Tzin Tzummer served as herald . The town purser and clerk was Auldo Morim .</p>
<p>A local group of the Purple Dragons helped to maintain law and order. In 1358 DR , this included nine soldiers and four hostlers. Their captain was named Flaergan Hondh . In addition, the town had a small militia of about 45 persons, who were well-trained but poorly supplied.</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , the town was ruled by Lord Azana Winter .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Unlike many other towns, most of Eveningstar's farming citizens ended their days early. The only establishments open after dark were the inns, the temple, and the Low Lantern . The famers rose at dawn and often took highsun naps, so the town was often very quiet in the early afternoon.</p>
<h3>Trade</h3>
<p>Eveningstar was an agricultural community producing primary products such as milk , eggs , poultry, mutton, carrots , beans , and parsnips , as well as value-added goods such as cheese , parchment, wool, and wine ; all of which were sold at a farmers' market held every six days. The town exported the parchment, wine, and wool that it produced to Suzail and as far as Daerlun in Sembia .</p>
<p>Eveningstar was also a popular stopover for frequent overland caravans, who patronized the local farmers and businesses. The most important business in town was the Lonesome Tankard tavern and inn, famous in Cormyr as one of the best places to eat, drink, and stay the night.</p>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>The House of the Morning was the only temple or shrine in the city—although the lord of the town would permit temporary shrines to be established with permission for up to three days in the town's central market. The many-spired temple had nearly 200 priests and followers of Lathander, who, in 1358 DR, were led by Patriarch Charisbonde Trueservant . The temple complex included a massive and productive pasture.</p>
<p>A blueleaf tree in the town acted as a portal to the capital of Suzail. It was created by a cleric of Mielikki .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The region around Eveningstar was once home to many spellcasters , who lived in towers or caves at the edge of the Stonelands.</p>
<p>In Mirtul of the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Lord Tessaril Winter was compelled to request military aid from King Azoun IV, after orcs and hobgoblins attacked the nearby fortress of High Horn in the mountains.</p>
<p>In 1368 DR , Eveningstar, along with Espar , Tyrluk , and Waymoot , was plagued by rogue dragons.</p>
<p>Like most of the settlements in this region, it suffered badly in the Goblin War of 1370 DR . Myrmeen Lhal , ruler of Arabel, used Eveningstar as a staging point for her troops to retake Arabel, and after their departure, orcs continued to attack the town.</p>
