<p>Hafkris was a half-orc fighter who operated as a slaver onboard the ill-fated pirate galley sailing towards Westhaven that crashed into the coast of the Island of Viledel in the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hafkris believed his captain mad for sailing during storm season, which resulted in the deaths of all the crew except the captain, Hafkris, and a large portion of the slave cargo. During the storm, Hafkris threw the captain overboard and would later have no regrets.</p>
<p>After the crash, Hafkris got drunk and wandered the beach in a stupor, marching up and down the front of the galley singing grotesque sailor-songs. Unbeknownst to him, the remaining slaves managed to free themselves. He planned to retrieve his heavy crossbow and 50 quarrels , and secure the slaves. His fate is unknown.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Before the crash, Hafkris took pleasure in taunting the slaves with their destination of Westhaven, a place he described as "the greatest pirate city in the world". If a slave mouthed off to him, he would take his belt off and hit them repeatedly with it.</p>
<p>After the crash, he was one step close to going crazy himself. He did not regret murdering the captain, only that he did so too late to save the ship. He even blamed the galley for "failing him". Despite his many failings, if he was to be overwhelmed by the slaves, he would surrender, but only to bide his time to escape and either chain them or slay them.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He was proficient in sword , dagger , crossbow and pike .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He wore studded leather and carried a broadsword and dagger, and left his heavy crossbow in the aft of the galley after the crash. His gear was valued at 53 gp .</p>
