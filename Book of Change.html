<p>The Book of Change was a book presenting a system of divination using trigrams. It was written by the sage Hsin Fu Chan of Kara-Tur . This method of divination was commonly nicknamed stick magic .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Legend told that Hsin Fu Chan discerned the trigrams from patterns in the back of a great lizard as it slept. After this inauspicious start, the trigrams were developed over time into a more sophisticated, less lizard-based method.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Use of the Book of Change was common to all levels of Shou society. However, using it was seen as a weakness in the Mandarinate , and mandarins would be embarrassed to reveal they did anything more than play with it.</p>
<p>It was also an important aspect of the magic wielded by priests of the Way . It functioned rather like the spell fate known to shukenja , but could be used by anyone without magic, though perhaps less reliably.</p>
<p>By 1357 DR , it was common for one to toss a handful of broken and whole chopsticks into a circle, and choose six from the top, producing a pattern of broken and unbroken lines. The user then consulted the Book of Change , finding two out of six possible trigrams that best matched the pattern. Each of the eleven possible combinations corresponded to a symbol and an explanation or recommendation for the future; those in the middle were more common than those at the extremes.</p>
<h2>Equipment</h2>
<p>A set of trigram sticks would typically be kept in a jar, from which they could be spilled to produce the patterns. This was kept alongside a copy of the Book of Changes . An expensive set comprised rosewood sticks in a jade jar, together with a hand-scribed book.</p>
