<p>Annalise was a young tavern wench at the Bubbling Bulwark circa 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Annalise was regarded as very pretty, and had bright red hair.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Annalise carried on a semi-secret relationship with Lord Partic Thistle , whom she loved dearly. The greatest impediment to their eventual marriage was the high-society scandal that would come from a noble marrying a common barmaid.</p>
<p>Annalise was best friends with her fellow wench Crystyn , and was on good terms with the other staff of the Bulwark.</p>
<p>The dashing young adventurer Garit Strongarm wished to have a relationship with her, but his possessive jealousy, cruel disposition, and fierce temper ruined any chances he might have had.</p>
<p>Annalise had something of a rival in the maid Tami , who tried to court Lord Thistle herself, to no effect.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , she had the traumatic experiences of having threats made against her by Garit Strongarm, and believing her beloved Partic had been murdered.</p>
