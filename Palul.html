<p>Palul was a Nexalan village near Nexal in Maztica .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Palul was located in green terraced mountains to the northeast of Nexal. Although Nexal was not visible directly from Palul, a journey around one of its neighboring mountains allowed an observer to see the city. The wilderness to the east of the village was inhabited by Kultakans .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A small pyramid dedicated to Zaltec stood in the middle of the village.</p>
<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>Farmers grew maize on the slopes and in the valley. Many colorful birds, such as parrots and macaws made their home in the area; their feathers were used by local featherworkers for pluma magic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Erixitl of Palul lived in this village as a child before she was captured by Kultakans and sold into slavery around 1351 DR . Although unknown to Erixitl at the time, this action was actually the beginning of a divine plan by the god Qotal to thwart the schemes that some evil deities had for Maztica.</p>
<p>In the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR , Cordell and the Golden Legion from Amn arrived in Maztica and, after defeating other Maztican nations, he led his force to march on Nexal. Their route took them through Palul. Naltecona the ruler of Nexal, had heard of the Legion's victories over the Payit and the Kultakans. Rather than fight them directly, he decided to organize a trap for them in Palul. He organized a large banquet to be given in honur of the foreigners in Palul, while at the same time hiding a large force of Nexalan warriors within and around the village. Cordell, upon arriving in Palul, accepted the invitation to the banquet, falsely believing that this was a genuine welcome to their coming. However, his mage Darien discovered the ruse as they were feasting and alerted Cordell to the betrayal. Cordell then gave orders to his men and their Maztican allies. They drew weapons and attacked the Nexalans before the Nexalans could strike first. The Legion and their Maztican allies overwhelmed the surprised Nexalans and decisively defeated them, slaughtered most of the inhabitants of Palul, and then looted and razed the village.</p>
<p>Following this, the Legion continued their march on Nexal. The events in Palul, however, convinced Naltecona that it was futile to fight the foreigners and led him to make the decision to surrender Nexal to them without resistance.</p>
