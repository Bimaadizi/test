<p>Ysdar was an old and wicked power of the Outer Planes that based itself in the Utter East and desired the destruction of all life there.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mar legend in Edenvale said Ysdar was a devil from another world, called the king of the Forgotten Ones . He was released during the Bloodforge Wars , when the Lords of the Five Kingdoms weakened his prison.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was said to be so ugly that looking on him would drive a person mad. Atreus Eleint , who journeyed from Duhlnarim to Langdarma in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , on a quest to steal sparkling water for his goddess Sune and become handsome, was called "Ysdar" or "a devil of Ysdar" by people from Edenvale as an insult, owing to how ugly he was.</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Ysdar was worshiped by the Fallen Temple , who, in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , attempted a plan to fully raise their god.</p>
