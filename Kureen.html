<p>Lady Kureen was a noblewoman from the city of Samargol , Samarach , circa 1374 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Lady Kureen offered patronage and protection to several merchants who operated in cities and towns of Samarach. One of the traders she patronized operated in the hamlet of Nimbre . In 1374 DR, the villagers of Nimbre were accused of being associated and corrupted by the much-hated yuan-ti and the Samarach Patrol was rounding up the accused to stand trial in Samargol. Lady Kureen's merchant, however, remained unharassed, thanks to the noblewoman's influence.</p>
