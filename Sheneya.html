<p>Sheneya was a werecobra assassin who plied her trade in the Domains of Dread . Her origins lay in Zakhara , where she was sired by an elder serpent .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In her human form, Sheneya stood approximately 5 feet and 6 inches (1.7 meters) tall. She was dark-skinned, almost skeletally lean, and completely hairless. Compared to the average human, her body was extraordinarily cold, only reaching about half the normal temperature.</p>
<p>Although she would be more comfortable in the nude, Sheneya wore clothing in order to fit in with human society. She picked her clothes solely with an eye for inconspicuousness rather than looks, and as such she ended up with a somewhat unkempt appearance.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>A ruthless killer, Sheneya had no regard for the lives of others.</p>
<p>Sheneya was awkward in her dealings with humans, even after years of growing more accustomed to their society. Her speech and mannerisms struck most of those around her as strange.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As a werecobra, Sheneya could change shape at will between human, giant cobra , and a hybrid between the two. In either of her non-human forms, she could deliver a potent venom through her bite.</p>
<p>Sheneya had the ability to enthrall onlookers with a dance which she called the "Dance of the Cobra".</p>
<p>Due to her poisonous blood, Sheneya was immune to the effects of any poison, herself. With the exception of snake charm , she was also impervious to all spells of the Charm sphere and the school of Enchantment due to her part-human-part-snake psyche.</p>
<p>Sheneya was unfazed by any attacks delivered by mundane weapons, unless they were made out of ivory .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>While she was reluctant to actually use it, Sheneya kept a magical dagger made of glass on her person.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Besides her occupation as an assassin, Sheneya busied herself with scholarly research concerning mankind's secrets. Stories involving serpents and especially the Grand Snakemaster were an area of interest.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sheneya's human parents, Jandi and Alleya , were a pair of adventuring entertainers who roamed Zakhara's deserts. One day, they met with what appeared to be an aging human nomad named Hister , who offered them magical secrets which could aid in snake charming. In exchange, he requested that Alleya bear his child, as he wished to have offspring before he passed on. The entertainers agreed to this proposal, and as Sheneya developed in her mother's womb over the ensuing months, she and Jandi reaped the rewards of their magical tutoring, becoming renowned snake charmers throughout the Land of Fate. Unbeknownst to the pair, however, was that Hister had been an elder serpent servant of the Grand Snakemaster in human guise, and that their child would not be a normal human.</p>
<p>As Alleya entered labor, she was stricken with a fever, to which she ended up succumbing mere minutes after giving birth to Sheneya. After a necropsy it was found that the mother's cause of death had been poison, on top of the revelation that the child was not Jandi's, authorities blamed Alleya's husband for her death, and he himself was executed by beheading. Sheneya entered the care of Hister, who had claimed to be her uncle. Her serpentine sire raised her to serve the Grand Snakemaster.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Due to her low body temperature, some misidentified Sheneya as being undead .</p>
