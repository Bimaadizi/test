<p>The Cabal of Madness was an alliance of Imaskari archmages in pursuit of power without limits. They gained the knowledge of how to build artifacts from horrors beyond their world, and over decades, constructed several devices of such power, masks known as the Faces of Madness . The masks were finished before −2488 DR , but not soon enough to allow the Cabal to carry out its plans: the Mulan rebelled, bolstered by the powers of their pantheons arriving that year. The masks became lost in the resulting tumult.</p>
