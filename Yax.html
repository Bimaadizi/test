<p>Sir Yax of Scornubel was an agent and a True Soul member of the Cult of the Absolute in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the Cult of the Absolute was attempting to co-opt orcs of the Trielta Hills into its army. The first envoy, Agent Mhoss , was slaughtered on sight as the orcs of the Ringfork Stronghold thought negotiations to be a sign of weakness. Following that failure, General Ketheric Thorm reassessed their approach to dealing with the orcs and Lord Heradd . Sir Yax of Scornubel was decided to be the next envoy as soon as he returned from the Wood of Sharp Teeth . Yax's strategy was to arrive accompanied by two ogres and issue a personal challenge to Lord Heradd for the killing of Agent Mhoss. Yax then would have to defeat the orcish Lord, force him to swear allegiance to the Absolute , and in exchange, the cult would offer Lord Heradd an alliance in conquering the other two orcish communities of the Trielta Hills.</p>
