<p>Glyrgoth was a white dracolich that laired in an abandoned mine somewhere in the Savage Frontier during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Among the riches in Glyrgoth's hoard was a beautiful porcelain figurine of a boar .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Glyrgoth amassed a hoard of riches, thanks to the efforts of the Pale Claw bandit gang. The bandits took control over the town of Womford for a time, offering "protection" in exchange for much of the peoples' hard-earned coin.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>While the mighty dracolich was the true overlord of the Pale Claw bandits, there existed another figurehead of the gang: the so-called Bandit King Grunnald . Grunnald tried to act as intermediary between his fellow townspeople in Womford and the gang, but was relegated to a strawman puppet of Glyrgoth.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in the 1490s DR , the adventurers Simon Aumar , Holga Kilgore , Edgin Darvis , and Thelvyn Kip broke into Glyrgoth's lair, and attempted to take back the stolen riches for the people of Womford. The adventurers were partially successful: they managed to remove a significant portion of the riches from Glyrgoth's lair, but were forced to abandon much of it when the great dracolich confronted them face-fo-face. The thieving adventurers managed to escape with their lives, but Glyrgoth swore revenge on them.</p>
