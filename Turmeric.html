<p>Turmeric was a common spice used in Turmish .</p>
<p>Well-prepared travellers in South and East Faerûn often carried a variety of spices and flavorings, including turmeric.</p>
<p>Turmeric could be mixed with dwarven deepfire brandy to make a substance that surface-dried as a clear coating (such as on metal), but when it dried completely after a few more hours, it disintegrated to ocher-colored turmeric powder once more. It could be used to surreptitiously mark items and those who handled them by the bright stains it left behind.</p>
