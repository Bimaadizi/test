<p>Half plate was a form of medium-weight armor used in Faerûn and other lands. It was a type of plate armor used by warriors who wanted a lighter form of protection than a full suit of plate. It was not to be confused with plate mail , which was also sometimes known as half plate.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Half plate was made up of shaped plate segments that covered the upper part of the body, and potentially a set of greaves for leg protection. This design gave more protection than just a breastplate while allowing the full range of mobility, while weighing and costing less than a full set of plate armor. For downsides, the plates made more noise when moving, and the whole suit could not be hidden under clothes like a simple breastplate could.</p>
