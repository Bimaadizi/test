<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1370 DR , Meryth Phaulkon met a charming and smitten young minor nobleman. She noticed the man admiring her from afar for a few months before he gathered the courage to introduce himself to her. They quickly became infatuated with each other, entering a relationship. Eventually, the young man revealed himself to be Georges , the Guild Master of the Shadow Thieves, the hated enemies of Waterdeep and its Lords . She thought it a cruel joke, but she was convinced when Georges took her to his chambers in the guild's stronghold in Undermountain . Upset but not discouraged, she continued the relationship. Georges subsequently proposed to her, and she accepted but only with one condition: Georges was to betray his guild to the Lords of Waterdeep, allowing them to exterminate the thieves one again.</p>
<p>Even though Georges agreed, preferring his future with the love of his life to the blood-soaked life of crime, the Guild Master's trusted lieutenant Hines reported the betrayal to the Shadow Thieves' Grand Master Xabash . The Grand Master ordered Hines to take Meryth hostage, dragging her into a lair deeper in Undermountain. Xabash had other and more cruel plans for Georges.</p>
<p>Eventually, Georges was confronted by an agent of the Lords of Waterdeep and willingly gave up the guild's plans to them. He only asked for one thing in exchange—for Meryth Phaulkon to be rescued.</p>
<p>Meryth was taken into Xabash's personal hideout deeper inside the Undermountain. The place was teeming with the Grand Master's elite thieves, tamed spectators , and trolls . Khelbenite was able to infiltrate the lair rescuing Meryth and allowing her to reunite with her lover.</p>
