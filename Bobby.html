He also carried with him potions of cure light wounds and heroism , as well as sovereign glue , and universal solvent . He also had a waterskin and trail rations for a day.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Very strong, he was adept at bashing and breaking things with his club.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bobby and his friends were originally from Earth , where they were in something called "the ninth grade". However, they became trapped in the Realm. They were later in some place they called "the Forgotten Realms", evidently not knowing the difference. [ speculation ] Bobby found a unicorn foal, imagininatively named Uni. Aiding by a mysterious entity known as the Dungeon Master , they battled monsters sent at them by the villainous Venger and tried to defeat him for good while struggling to find a way home.</p>
<h3>The Victims of Tiamat</h3>
<p>Living long before the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , Bobby was among a band of young adventurers who were all trying to find a way back to their distant home. Rumors claimed he also had a pet miniature unicorn. However, it was said they were all slain horribly by Tiamat , with the barbarian and his unicorn both being swallowed by one of her heads. By 1369 DR , the Adventurer Mart in Athkatla , Amn , displayed paintings of Hank and Bobby.</p>
<h3>The Grand Tour of the Realms</h3>
<p>In the 1360s DR, Bobby and his friends (no unicorn in sight) made their way to the town of Shadowdale in Faerûn so that Presto could ask the great sage Elminster to take him on as an apprentice. While drinking in the Old Skull Inn , they spotted Elminster arrive. When Presto lost his nerve, Bobby pointed out that Elminster wasn't busy and stood beside him to declare his friend's suitability.</p>
<p>Thus, Elminster whisked Presto away on a whirlwind tour of the Realms, and he came back traumatized and beaten and decided it best not to be his apprentice. Nevertheless, Presto had ideas for future adventures with his friends.</p>
<p>At this time, he was middle-aged. Moreover, Bobby had grown to be the largest of his group in both height and width. He became extremely muscular and his hair significantly had darkened from blonde to brown. Much of his apparel remained the same.</p>
<h3>The High Sun Games</h3>
<p>In the late 1490s DR, Bobby and his friends, all adults now and without unicorn, were one of six teams competing in the High Sun Games in the newly built arena in Neverwinter . They evaded the displacer beast and Bobby found a battleaxe in one of the chests. They even got to the center of the maze and safely inside the sanctuary cage at the end, winning that round. However, the Red Wizard of Thay Sofina used the horn of beckoning death above the arena soon after, so their fate is unknown.</p>
<h3>Went to Waterdeep</h3>
<p>Aged only 9, Bobby and friends were camping in a forest one night when the Dungeon Master arrived to check on them, soon abandoning them again with promises of finding snacks, such as the spicy fried potatoes they liked. Hank grew annoyed at this and their lack of progress on getting back to Earth; he had a new plan, but Bobby and the others were tired and were accepting their new life. But then driders and darkmantles ambushed them, and they fought their way out and into a mysterious portal that opened. It dumped them from a height into the streets of Waterdeep , now in daytime and autumn. They were met by a girl who was pleased her spell had worked.</p>
<h3>Now in Neverwinter</h3>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, Bobby was an adventuring adult, accompanied by fully matured Uni. The duo found themselves joining adventurers of Neverwinter in defense of kindly folk of Faerûn circa 1479 DR .</p>
