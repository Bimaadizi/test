<p>Garl Gnarlclaw was a gnoll Harper agent on the Sword Coast North in the late 15 th century DR. Working as a spy, he infiltrated the Blackdagger Bandits .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>For a period lasting some months, Garl lived undercover among the Blackdagger Bandits as a spy for the Harpers. Although he learned a lot about the Blackdaggers and their secrets, the experience left him especially resentful towards them, exhibiting no sympathy for them as he received reports of successful attacks against their number.</p>
<p>Circa the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , fellow Harper Xalliana put Garl in contact with an adventurer , the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge , to aid in the fight against the Blackdaggers and they met in the ruins of Cragmire Keep . He ordered the adventurer to slay bandits and their officers to thin their ranks and weaken their command structure. He even helped the adventurer infiltrate Grimstorm Keep and slay the bandits' raid leader, Jareth Grim , to smash their leadership. Later, he sent a band of adventurers into Cragmire Crypts to seek Xalliana, and found and defeated Traven Blackdagger and Kallos Tam . Finally, Garl and Xalliana were able to move a siege tower close to Blackdagger Keep. With it, they sent a band of adventurers to storm the keep and finally slay Malus Blackdagger before his bandit army could assault Neverwinter . Thanks to these efforts, the Blackdaggers were broken and scattered, and Garl hoped it would lead to Neverwinter working with the Harpers in future.</p>
