<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lichskull was the creation of the arch-mage named Cledos , crafted some years before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . The wizard's loyal assistant, the half-orc Hans Kludgen , was tasked with traveling across Toril in search of the rarest arcane material components for his master. But his travels and tireless work were rewarded with decapitation. Hans unwittingly provided one last rare arcane component for Cledos, who, through a rare ritual, transformed the half-orc's skull into the Lichskull .</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the helmet found its way to the eastern nation of Rashemen , where it was discovered in Shadow Mulsantir , the city's dark Shadowfell echo.</p>
