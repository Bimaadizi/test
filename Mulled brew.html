<p>Mulled brew was an alcoholic beverage made from beer or ale and served hot. It was popular in many inns and taverns across Faerûn , especially in areas with colder climates.</p>
<h2>Recipe</h2>
<p>There were many variations of this drink, but a typical recipe started with a strong-flavored beer or ale. Moon Mountain Dark was a favored base for humans in the Savage Frontier , circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<p>All ingredients except the rum were heated in a pot to the verge of boiling. When the brew was ready, the rum was added and pot was removed from the heat, stirred, and allowed to cool for a short time (one or two verses of a drinking song was about right).</p>
