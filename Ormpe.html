<p>Ormpé was a city along the coast of the Golden Water . It was the fastest growing city in the region during the late 14 th century DR.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In 1373 DR , Ormpé was a rustic mining community.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Of all the cities in the Shining Lands, only Ormpé had large slum areas. The largest of them, the Quarter of No Hope, resided outside the walls.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The gemstone chaka was native to Ormpé. Gnomes were a common sight in the city. So was the Finglefall chaka. The field glass was an invention of the gnomes of the city.</p>
<p>Most of the people in the Quarter of No Hope were migrant grain workers, though some tried to obtain mining jobs, which paid better. However, the Gemstone chaka preferred to hire dwarven miners and gnomish gemcutters, having come to an agreement with the Finglefall chaka: whoever wanted to work on the famous Curna emeralds needed to come to an agreement with at least one of those chakas. However, several chakas had made their fortunes with the sale of gemstones by 1372 DR .</p>
<p>A lot of scholars lodged at the city on the way to use the Library of Curna.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ormpé was another fishing village that grew into a trade hub before it was conquered by beholder princes in the Year of the Iron Colossus, 147 DR . These beholders were defeated by demons come from the Curna Mountains in the Year of the Wolfstone, 153 DR . The leader of the demons was a nasty ghour demon . The city was not recovered until the Year of the Consuming Glory, 1103 DR , when the forces of Var , Durpar and Estagund defeated the demons and forced their leader into flight; it was rumoured he took up with the local hill giants .</p>
<p>An influx of people started around 1365 DR , doubling the population by 1367 DR . The influx of people had gone well beyond even what the local ruling council expected: Ormpé developed a rather large slum. By 1373 DR , it was expected things would turn ugly if the squalor was left unaddressed.</p>
<p>Ormpé had fallen into the Golden Water by 1479 DR DR.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Though the city had started as merely the location for ironworks, the population doubled between 1365 and 1367; 5000 of them lived in slums by the later date. Ormpè had a large population of demihumans, particularly dwarves and gnomes, with many halflings as well, by that year.</p>
<p>Albeit the city continued to grow, it had only 4500 inhabitants in 1373 DR .</p>
