<p>Hammar Breskult was a highly skilled warrior and one of the nine founding members of the shady mercantile organization known as the Great Goblet . As of the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , he was a member in good standing.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Breskult was tall in stature with a well-muscled physique. He had a full beard that he kept neatly trimmed in the shape of a shovel blade. He typically wore a suit of field plate that bore the rusting scars of years of combat, and carried a greatsword .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Hammar had the calm demeanor of someone who was quite sure of himself and didn't have to prove it to anyone.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He was an excellent fighter and a former leader of a mercenary company. His skill with battle strategy and personal combat translated into dirty deals and confidence schemes in service to the Great Goblet.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>In addition to his armor and sword, Hammar had several daggers of various types hidden on his person. Like all of the nine Lords, he possessed a golden goblet that contained a desiccated finger or toe of a former colleague that tried to assert his dominance over the others. Hammar was part of the conspiracy that brought down this self-appointed leader and then formed the Great Goblet. The goblet and its grisly contents were intended as a warning against treachery among the inner circle.</p>
