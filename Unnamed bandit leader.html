<p>This unnamed bandit leader was a human bandit in the bandit camp near the Mere of Dead Men on the Sword Coast North .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the Kalach-Cha came to the bandit leader, the leader was calm, as his plans had been foiled and had no power to resist. The Kalach-Cha had three choices for dealing with the leader: leave him in peace, kill him, or persuade him to join the Graycloaks of Neverwinter (the last idea sounding quite insane to him).</p>
