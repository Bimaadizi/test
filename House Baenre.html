<p>House Baenre pronounced : /ˈ b eɪn r eɪ / BANE-ray was the first drow house of Menzoberranzan , and had been for centuries—as long as anyone in the city could remember.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The story of House Baenre's ascension to the premier rank in the city was not known to any living drow; the only person who might have known the true history of the house is Yvonnel Baenre , the former Matron Mother who took power in −7 DR . Even with the death of Yvonnel Baenre during the failed invasion of Mithral Hall in 1358 DR , the first house's power could not be usurped; Triel Baenre , the first and most powerful daughter of Yvonnel Baenre, took her mother's place as supreme ruler.</p>
<p>Soon after the death of Yvonnel, House Baenre was at the weakest it had been for centuries. During the Silence of Lolth in 1372 DR and 1373 DR , particularly during the slave revolt and then siege of Menzoberranzan by the duergar , Triel struggled to secure her hold over both her house and the city. She sought allies along the other houses, particularly House Xorlarrin , and cultivated a close ally relationship with House Mizzrym .</p>
<p>During the Siege of Menzoberranzan in 1372 - 1373 DR , there were only seven wizards of House Baenre: Gromph Baenre , Nauzhror Baenre , Julani Baenre , Grendan Baenre , Noori Baenre , Zoran Baenre , and Prath Baenre . However, Julani was killed towards the end of the siege when his lightning bolt cast through a scrying gem on Nimor Imphraezl reflected back on him.</p>
<p>Triel was not able to hold on to power forever. In 1383 DR , Quenthel Baenre , Triel's younger sister, became matron mother.</p>
<p>In 1490 DR , after the civil war in Menzoberranzan that began with the heresy of Quenthel and Yvonnel Baenre II , a deal was brokered between Sos'Umptu Baenre and Jarlaxle to let all heretics leave the city, while Sos'Umptu would take over as the new matron mother of House Baenre.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The main strength of House Baenre lay in clerical prowess; Lolth favored the first house strongly, responding (comparatively) generously to their prayers, and the house was also able to boast many high priestesses, including Quenthel Baenre , who held the crucial and influential position as Matron Mistress of Arach-Tinilith . Gromph Baenre , the Archmage of Menzoberranzan , was also a member of House Baenre, which significantly increases the influence of the house both politically and militarily, as he held sway over Sorcere .</p>
<p>The Black Claw Mercantile Company was a trade consortium based in Menzoberranzan and primarily owned by House Baenre.</p>
<h2>The Baenre Compound</h2>
<p>House Baenre occupied the highest tier, a ledge called Qu'ellarz'orl , in the main cavern of Menzoberranzan. It was made up of twenty stalagmites and thirty stalactites. A central stalagmite, called the Great Mound, housed the Baenre nobles and the house chapel. There was a balcony surrounding the Great Mound where stalagmites and stalactites met. The compound was roughly oval in shape, three-eighths of a mile long and a quarter mile wide, and surrounded by a magnificent and magical fence, appearing as a silvery spider's web around the general blue hues of the Baenre compound. This fence stood 20 feet high and acted as the house's main defense; anything touching the fence would become stuck fast until the Matron Mother willed it released. It was impossible to pass through the enchanted fence without the aid of the spider mask , a magical item in the possession of Gromph, the Archmage of Menzoberranzan —assuming, of course, that one was able to avoid the guards posted around the fence.</p>
<p>The house chapel was a domed shape and featured an illusion created by Gromph that switched from spider to drow female. This statue was based on Gromph's lover, Sosdrielle Vandree , but it once took on the appearance of Liriel Baenre as sign of Lolth's favor.</p>
<p>The matron mother's throne was formed of an enormous adamantine spider. It was magical and contained a symbol repelling any attack.</p>
