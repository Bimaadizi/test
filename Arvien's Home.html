<h2>Services</h2>
<p>She worked out of the back rooms of her house and created high-quality items for a hefty price. Arvien specialized in crafting a large number of the same, identical items, a feat which required no small amount of skill. For example, she made dozens of matching beer steins all engraved with the coat-of-arms of the establishment for which they were ordered.</p>
<p>The parlor of Arvien's home was used to showcase her work and would attract many passersby to stop, enter, and admire her works. She would offer them tea and/or wine while they examined the masterfully crafted goblets , dishes, bells , spice dishes and other finished goods she had on display.</p>
