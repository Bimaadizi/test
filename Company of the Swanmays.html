<p>The Company of the Swanmays , or simply the Swanmays , was a somewhat well-known all-female adventuring group of seven, active in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Company of the Swanmays had a long history that dated to the days of the old Myth Drannor . Princess Daemir was one of the group's ancient members.</p>
<p>Before Swanmays' alleged disbandment circa 1350 DR , the adventuring company often adventured around Suzail , the Dalelands , and surrounding regions. When they earned their living by guarding and guiding trader caravans through Cormanthor , they often passed through Shadow Gap and stayed in the North Gate Inn . When seasons changed, they spent their winters in Shadowdale , enjoying the warm company and strong drinks with Jhaele Silvermane at the Old Skull Inn .</p>
<p>Even though Alias' false memories suggested the adventuring group to be long-disbanded, they were very much still active. In 1357 DR , the Swanmays aided the adventuring party possessing the Azure Bonds to kill Dracandros .</p>
<p>A few years later, the Swanmays found themselves captured by a group of drow after they spent a night at Zhentil Keep . The drow occupied the keep, holding hostage some of the citizens, and all the Swanmays members but Silk . To the residents of Zhentil Keep's dismay, the drow were allowed to run amok as the leaders of the keep turned a blind eye to it all. The reason behind the abductions was that one of Bane 's three lieutenants, the marilith Kaliste , was using the abductees as sacrifices. Silk managed to recruit heroes from Phlan to aid her in the rescue mission.</p>
