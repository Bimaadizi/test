<p>Gray Goose Provisioners was a store in Eshpurta run by Carn Wittsome and his mistress, Nethris Perndle . The Gray Goose carried good trail rations and other small supplies for those that needed or wanted to travel. Prices were very reasonable but sometimes it was awkward interrupting an argument between the two proprietors to make a purchaseâ€”the elderly couple bickered constantly on just about every topic. The shop was located next door to Bhamm's Herbs in the southern quarter of the city.</p>
