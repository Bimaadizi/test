<p>Parley Pool was a harbor located in Skullport .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Parley Pool was located on the southwestern coast of Skull Island . The area surrounding Parley Pool featured a pebble-strewn beach that gently sloped toward the water. During high tide, the waters of the pool rose to the very walls of the Skull Island fortress, temporarily submerging the beach. After the tides receded, fortunate individuals occasionally discovered valuable items washed ashore. These items were believed to originate from the mysterious shipwrecks in the South Seacaves , transported by the flow through the magical locks.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The name 'Parley Pools' originated from an incident involving an audacious Luskanite who insisted on conducting his business during a time when the Skulls of Skullport had forbidden all commerce in Skullport. As the Luskanite vehemently protested from the deck of his ship, several flame cannons unexpectedly turned on the vessel and unleashed a destructive barrage. The ship was obliterated, and all those on board perished. Since that fateful event, vessels arriving at Parley Pool did so with their armaments lowered, adhering to proper decorum to avoid a similar fate.</p>
