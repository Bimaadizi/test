<p>Wizardgout Water was a fountain located in High Dale . It was the source of a stream that flowed down to Saerb .</p>
<p>The fountain was actually a petrified wizard named Yalumvrael of Athkatla whose body was turned to stone and enspelled to produce an endless flow of water. Yalumvrael earned this fate after he attempted to slay the Magister Alvaerele Tasundrym . Yalumvrael's body was buried in a landslide, but the site retained its original name.</p>
