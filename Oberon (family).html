<p>The Oberon family was a patriar family that owned the majority of Baldur's Gate 's dry docks.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Oberons lived in a home that was situated to the central-south area of Manorborn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1482 DR , a young member of the Oberon family, along with other nobles, removed the hand of the Beloved Ranger statue. They used a dagger as a crowbar and hammer , which bore the mark of the Oberon family. The gouged dagger was dropped, and pointed this individual to the crime. As such, the young Oberon hid away in Horgold Hadru 's cellar, along with the others, as Hadru owed one of the patriar families a favor.</p>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Baldur's Gate became plagued by a series of murders and disappearances. The members of the Flaming Fist showed little interest in addressing the incidents, but after the patriar families of Caldwell , Oberon, and Linnacher became affected, the pressure from Flaming Fist demanding investigations from their superiors started to increase.</p>
