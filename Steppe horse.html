<p>The Steppe horse or steppe pony was a rather homely but deceptively powerful breed of horse that was native to the steppelands of the Plain of Horses in northwestern Kara-Tur and was found in northeast Faerûn and the Hordelands . Often considered a "half-wild" breed, they stood amongst the toughest and most ferocious horse breeds on Toril and the greatest of the breed were known as huluk in the Chuchian tongue of the Plainsmen of the Plain of Horses. In western Faerûn , they were known as Tuigan coursers ; they were strong, fast, and fearless, a combination prized in warfare and in adventuring.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Looking unlike any other horse breed in Kara-Tur, these animals resembled something of a mix between a horse and a pony . They were fairly short, standing just 13–14 hands (4.4–4.8 inches, or 1.32–1.42 meters) at the withers (the ridge between the shoulder blades), yet were rather heavy. Steppe horses had stubby legs and short necks, such that their heads appeared overly large in comparison. Their shaggy winter coats were most often copper or bronze in hue, with a stripe of lighter yellow hair that ran down their backs. Their heavy bones and small, unusual appearance made them a rather awkward-looking and unimpressive steed.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>While they were not graceful or imposing, Steppe horses possessed heroic stamina, strength, and resilience, and could run at a swift pace for great distances, despite their short legs, even with a rider. Their thick bones gave them their strength and a robustness against blows that enabled them to resist attacks. A huluk 's ribcage was almost a solid wall of bone, giving them the greatest protection. Their thick, shaggy hide also provided protection.</p>
<p>Although small, a Steppe horse's strength enabled it to carry the loads of a larger steed.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>A fearless and aggressive horse, they had a steady temperament and were quite reliable on the battlefield. In fact, Steppe ponies did not need to be trained for warfare and they did not shy away from clashing weaponry, loud noises, or fire and rarely panicked</p>
<p>In particular, huluk had an instinct to fight and were even considered violent. Even huluk colts were known to kill wolves . On the battlefield, a huluk would keep charging and attacking after their riders were slain. For this reason, Plainsmen used huluk to lead charges.</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>A Steppe pony fought by kicking with its front legs and by biting and trampling.</p>
<h2>Homelands</h2>
<p>These horses roamed wild on the steppelands of the northern Plain of Horses. In fact, the name "Plain of Horses" was given to it by the Shou Lung mandarins , after the horses they saw as its main cultural and economic feature, for it seemed to have little other value.</p>
<p>A herd of wild huluk was found in the plane of Qui , grazing in lush valley meadows during its Season of the Unicorn. They would attack visitors and fight to the death.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Wild Steppe horses usually form herds of around 50 to 100, but could be as few as 20 and as many as a 1,000. Normally, 60% would be classes as medium warhorses, 20% as light warhorses, and 20% as heavy warhorses, and only 10% as the exceptional huluk .</p>
<p>Due to the rather sparse vegetation of their native lands, Steppe horses could sustain themselves by grazing alone and did not require grain or other feed to survive. While lesser horses would grow weak on the sparse steppeland grasses, Steppe horses flourished. Moreover, it did not matter what kind of vegetation; when needed, a Steppe horse would grind the hardest, driest feed in their strong jaws or use their hooves to smash through ice to get at frozen moss. They also only needed to be given water once a day. They could survive in both hot and cold weather.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Steppe horses were the most prized resource of the nomadic Plainsmen tribes. The Kashghun tribe at the city of Chegoyui in the Quoya Desert traded them to Shou Lung and they were a regular source of prosperity for the tribe. The horse-trader Marash Rashi was the most successful there. The Tsu-tsu tribe were able breeders, while the Igidujin launched raids to steal them. For taxation purposes, one horse was counted as equal to one cow or seven sheep or half a camel .</p>
<p>Outside the Plain of Horses, Steppe horses were commonly employed by the various other nomadic tribes of the Hordelands. Steppe horses were commonly ridden by Tuigan warriors and their khans , and even by General Hubadai and his nightguards. They were considered one of the key weapons of the Tuigan, accounting for their rapid movements in war.</p>
<p>However, in Faerûn in the late 14 th century DR , these horses were not highly valued or sought after. They were only familiar to the peoples of the Endless Wastes and Rashemen , where the Tuigan tribes and Rashemaar regularly rode Steppe horses. They were also known in Thesk , but did not go for high prices, typically only 70 gp . Elsewhere in Faerûn, they were not known at all and were nigh impossible to obtain. Nevertheless, they offered a specific appeal to certain breeders looking to enhance their own stock with greater strength or stamina and they might pay extra. The Steppe horse was among the breeds bred into the Sosser employed in Sossal and elsewhere in north Faerûn .</p>
<p>By around 1479 DR , however, the Vaegould tribe of the the Ride in north Faerûn also rode steppe ponies.</p>
<p>Circa 1479 DR , Tuigan coursers were among the valuable warhorses that could be summoned from crystal chargers , which were sold in Neverwinter during the Simril winter festival.</p>
<h2>Significance</h2>
<p>On the Plain of Horses, Plainsmen soldiers formed close bonds with their Steppe horses. Before any mission or battle, they would explain the plan in detail to the horse; they thought it was good omen if the horse listened attentively, and a bad omen if the horse snorted and bucked. These horses were so valued that, if food supplies were limited, they would feed their horses before their own families. This was due to their remarkable kindness to animals. Horse-racing was also a popular pastime. Horse-wrestling was also practiced by the Fankiang tribe.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around Shou Year 2600 (1350 DR) , Razak Irdi of the city of Chegoyui in the Quoya Desert stole one of the most valuable huluk belonging to the qaghan . He fled north and remained apart ever since. He preferred the company of wild horses and always traveled with a herd, numbering 20–50.</p>
<p>For thwarting the plots of the disgraced pan lung Za-Jikku circa Wa Year 1776 (1358 DR) , Daimyo Osari Daizan of Tifuido , Wa , presented a band of adventurers with many gifts and rewards, including a huluk imported from the Plain of Horses.</p>
<p>Circa 1350 DR , a halfling cleric of Chauntea of Verdusk named Brother Twick journeyed to the Farsea Marshes in order to minister to the Marsh Drovers and for the expedition, he took a sturdy steppe pony. Their combined weight caused an earth collapse, dropping them into a mud pit, where they were stranded until rescued by the Marsh Drovers, after which they continued to their village. Next, Twick rode his pony to the Tun Marshes .</p>
