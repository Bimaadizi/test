<p>Rosie Beestinger , called Grandmother Night by some, was a halfling monk and a cartographer who was a part of Acquisitions Incorporated "C" Team in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Rosie was a grandmotherly yet feisty and sassy woman of studious and schooled demeanor. She had a light skin wrinkled with advanced age and long gray hair she usually kept braided. In 1496 DR, Rosie was 110 winters old. She was a petite woman of only 30 pounds (14 kilograms) but she was far from defenseless.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As an experienced monk, Rosie could disappear into the shadows only to pummel an unaware enemy. She was proficient at deflecting incoming missiles, and her training granted her the benefits of having a timeless body. Rosie also possessed certain innate spellcasting abilities that allowed her to cast such spells as minor illusion , sacred flame , thaumaturgy , command , darkness , darkvision , pass without trace , and silence .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Rosie carried a set of cartographer's tools branded with Acquisitions Incorporated logo. Around her neck, the hin wore an enchanted necklace of the greater will composed of massive beads. A magic belt of the Beestinger was wrapped around Rosie's waist, guiding her blows towards their target. She wielded the Beestinger staff , a gift from Walnut Dankgrass , and on other occasions a staff of the master . Other items found on her person were Rosie's collection of eyeballs stuffed in a jar and a bagful of emeralds .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Rosie Beestinger was a member of an uncannily numerous halfling family. The number of children she'd had throughout her life, both born and adopted, was staggering. Pendragon Beestinger was one of Rosie's adopted children who embraced the family's alleged criminal activities and once attempted to assassinate his mother only to be killed in turn. Later, Pendragon Beestinger was resurrected at Rosie's request.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Rosie, along with Walnut Dankgrass, Donaar Blit'zen , and K'thriss Drow'b , was hand-picked by Omin Dran , the founder of Acquisitions Incorporated, to form the organization's "C" Team.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Duplicitous Courtier, 1496 DR , Rosie Beestinger resided in the Dran & Courtier inn in the town of Red Larch . Her room was quite spartan: nothing more than a mat, map sheaths, and a training dummy. Along with the "C" Team, Rosie became nothing short of a legendary individual amongst the hin.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Rosie and her family had a reputation beyond that of a heroic adventuress. There were rumors that alleged Rosie's connection to a number of nefarious halfling criminal organizations, however, none of the rumors was proven to be true and Rosie herself claimed to possess no knowledge of any shady dealings nor criminal activities, despite her nickname "Grandmother Night."</p>
