<p>Ashroot was a succubus agent of Graz'zt in Zortagra during the late 1480s DR.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 1480s DR, the demon lord Graz'zt sent Ashroot disguised as a deep gnome to spread his madness in Zortagra. She assisted the ruler Daleen Duerna in her throne room until an adventuring party, hired by Elanil Elassidil to investigate crazed duergar , arrived in Zortagra. Ashroot tried to kill them but the adventurers defeated Ashroot and her shadow demon minions and stopped the spread of madness by taking away her samovar.</p>
