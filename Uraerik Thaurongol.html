<p>Uraerik Thaurongol was a dwarven crafter and smith who lived and worked in Everlund circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Uraerik was the creator of an ornate, life-sized dragon head that was purchased by the proprietors of the Wyrmworks in Silverymoon to display in their shop when the main attraction, Old Roaring Rage , was rented out. The stand-in was made from electrum and was a whimsical representation of an unknown type of dragon. It was not for sale, but miniature versions of it rendered in metal by "lesser" dwarven smiths of Silverymoon sold for 200 to 400 gold pieces .</p>
