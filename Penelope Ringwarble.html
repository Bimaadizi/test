<p>Penelope Ringwarble was a writer who lived and published her work sometime circa the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Penelope's book – Adopters of Culture , was an anthropological work that voiced her opinion on the culture, or lack thereof, among the half-orcish people of Faerûn . The book was published sometime in or before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR and found among the possessions of the inhabitants of Baldur's Gate .</p>
<p>Penelope's cousin, Joyce Ringwarble , did not share Penelope's favorable view of half-orcs. She showed disdain and desire to sterilize them in her work titled Tusky Grins . In that book, Joyce mentions how a half-orc or orc, without warning or provocation, ate at the very least the fingers of Penelope's daughter while leaving her alive and screaming. Joyce believed this event was the catalyst for Penelope's descent into madness .</p>
