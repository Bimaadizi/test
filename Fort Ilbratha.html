<p>Fort Ilbratha was the name given to an abandoned fort in the eastern foothills of the Troll Mountains , on the eastern border of Amn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The log palisade that once ringed the fort was burned to the ground and entirely erased, but the stone foundations survived into the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The fort lay on the eastern side of the Troll Mountains, and controlled the quickest east–west pass through mountains. This pass was also the only one that didn't lead into the Snakewood .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The fort was built to be the northernmost defense of the 4 th century DR realm of Valashar . However, on King Ashar Tornamn 's push north in the Year of the Woeful Resurrection, 375 DR , the Calishite garrison there was left with a bare skeleton staff.</p>
<p>Following Valashar's defeat to Cormyrean forces in the Year of the Leaping Hare, 376 DR , Prince Azoun Obarskyr I of Cormyr pushed on through Amn , Valashar, and Tethyr , pillaging many garrisons. With the magical sword Ilbratha in hand, Azoun overran the few remaining defenders of this fort and razed it to the ground, with the campaign continuing deeper into the Shoon Imperium until his victorious sacking of Ithmong .</p>
<p>The garrison's original name was lost; history recorded it as "Fort Ilbratha" after the famed sword that destroyed it.</p>
