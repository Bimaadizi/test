<p>Mangee was a board game played with a set of ten enchanted jade figurines that originated from the land of Shou Lung in Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mangee used a ten-sided board to play the game and needed a full set of twenty-five pieces. Each game piece was an expertly carved jade figurine of a creature, and each was enchanted with alteration , enchantment , and conjuration magics and was valued at 500 gold pieces . The figurines' magic could only be used if all the pieces were assembled together, and no divination sorcery could reveal the magic before the set was completed.</p>
<p>Some of the jade figurines were: a dragon , a lion , an eagle , a monkey , and a bear .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The origins of Mangee were obscure but traceable to the Empire of Shou Lung in Kara-Tur, long before the 14 th century DR. An incomplete set of figurines was recovered in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR by a band of heroes of the Living City. The Mangee statuettes were hidden in a cave in the mountains on the Vast inhabited by deadly creatures like chimerae and manticores .</p>
