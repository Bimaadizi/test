<p>Giant beavers were a species of larger than normal beavers .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Giant beavers typically fled from attackers, but would fight fiercely if they were cornered or if their lodge was under attacked. In such cases they were known to slap their tails against the water, which all members of their community recognized as an alarm.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Giant beavers were known to prize the bark and twigs of certain species of trees. These most often included aspen , birch , and willow trees. Much like a normal beaver, their young were referred to by the term kit .</p>
<h3>Lairs</h3>
<p>Giant beavers altered their environment by building large dams out of logs and mud, which diverged water into forming lake lakes that they would inhabit. In the center of these lakes, they built would a community of "lodges" out of similar materials to inhabit. The walls of these structures were typically 5 feet (1.5 meters) thick at the least.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Giant beavers were found in both the freshwater bodies and salt marshes of the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Possessing a low to average level of intelligence, these animals were known to sometimes engage in trade with other creatures. People were sometimes known to even persuade them with coins or valuable goods to construct dam-like structures, though they would only agree to such a deal if there was water close to the building zone.</p>
<p>Other creatures were occasionally known to capture kits and sell them at markets. They were also known be hunted for their pelts, typically fetching prices of around 500 to 2,000 gp .</p>
