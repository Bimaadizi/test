<p>Sothillis , or Sythillis , was an ogre mage who attacked the southern cities of Amn in West Faerûn and founded the Sothillisian Empire .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>While he is a renowned leader, Sothillis is greatly feared for his cruel actions.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>With mottled green skin and jet black hair, Sythillis is a giant among even the ogre magi, standing just under 16 feet (4.8m) tall and weighing nearly two tons. His short, red horns are encircled in mithral -laced arcane runes.</p>
<h2>Equipment</h2>
<p>Among Sothillis' possessions are Kingscar , Blue Lightning , a medallion of thoughts and a ring of evasion .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1368 DR , a letter from the Iron Throne leader Rieltar Anchev to Davaeorn referenced the " Sythillisian uprising " in Amn as a reason why Amn did not act to stop the Iron Crisis .</p>
<p>In 1370 DR , Sythillis along with Cyrvisnea , led an army of goblins , kobolds , ogres , hill giants and worshipers of Cyric in attacks upon southern Amn . At the end of their campaign, they assaulted the city of Murann and captured gold from Maztica . Their army numbered almost 3,000 soldiers.</p>
<p>In 1372 DR , Sythillis entered the short but bloody conflict with the kingdom of Tethyr later named the Bloody Fall . The cause of the attack remain unclear, however, many historians believed that the fires of war were stocked by corrupt leadership of the Crimson Guard , a mercenary company that served Queen Zaranda Star . Another theory claimed that an agent of the Unseen - a malaugrym , manipulated both sides and causing the aggression for its own nefarious needs. The conflict reportedly cost thousands of lives and came to conclusion when an unnamed hero fought through Sothillis's hordes and defeated the warlord in battle.</p>
<p>As of 1374 DR , the force still inhabited Murann. His legacy would be the formation of an empire that would persist well into the 15 th century DR and come to be known as Muranndin .</p>
<p>By 1482 DR , Sythillis's giant sword, the Kingscar was displayed in a small gallery of the Seatower of Balduran , possible evidence of the ogre mage's demise.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>According to some tavern rumors, Sothillis was one of the Bhaalspawn who was killed by a fire giant (presumably Yaga-Shura ). Obviously, this rumor was false as Sothillis was still active well into 1374 DR.</p>
