<p>The Company of the Sundered Orc was the name of one or two adventuring companies active on the Sword Coast in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The company had five members circa 1368 DR:</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>First Company</h3>
<p>In the early 1360s DR, the Company of the Sundered Orc had started exploring the dungeons of Undermountain . On their first expedition, they discovered the Librarium on the first level, called the Dungeon Level , and returned alive to boast about its wonders. They kept its precise location to themselves, however, and arranged for several porters to join them on their next expedition to carry out its vast and eclectic collection of books and scrolls . They were not seen again as of 1373 DR and had presumably died there.</p>
<h3>Second Company</h3>
<p>The five adventurers —Lorar, Pelops, Jared, Cassandra, and Wynara—came together in Daggerford relatively recently as of 1368 DR and soon headed for Waterdeep , not yet even having a name for their company. En route , they encountered a small orc raiding band and destroyed them, so they named themselves for this event.</p>
<p>In Waterdeep, they went to the Yawning Portal inn and began exploring the dungeons of Undermountain as adventurers do. In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , they elected to locate a supposed treasure hoard on the second level, the Arcane Chambers , which the Waterdhavian merchant-adventurer Essimuth Lanys claimed to have sighted. They ventured down the well just after sunset on Eleint 2 , and had not yet returned by the end of the month. The Tymoran priest Adama Miiralin stationed at the inn recorded this in his monthly report to High Priestess Seenroas Halvinhar .</p>
<p>In fact, all five of them had been captured by drow slavers in the Arcane Chambers and were soon to be transported to Skullport .</p>
