<p>The Talon of Umberlee was an artifact of importance to Umberlee , the godess of the sea, which had the power to harm aquatic creatures .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The artifact was a heavy gold statue in the shape of a hooked claw. It was large enough to fill an entire treasure chest .</p>
<p>If the statue fell into the hands of someone whom Umberlee deemed unworthy to posses it, she would send her faithful to take it from them.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>It was said that the Talon of Umberlee could be used to protect an entire city against threats from the sea. On a smaller scale, if someone with sufficient magical knowledge touched the statue, they could use it to unerringly inflict injuries on all aquatic creatures within 25 feet (7.6 meters).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1479 DR , the Talon of Umberlee surfaced on the black market in Waterdeep , where Dagult Neverember arranged to purchase it for an outrageous sum of money in order to use it to bolster Neverwinter 's defenses. He hired a privateer named Szart Tilhavar , captain of the Floating Cask , to sail to Waterdeep, acquire the artifact, and return it to Neverwinter. However, the Floating Cask was attacked and sunk on its return trip by Tidescourge pirates led by " Captain Bloodbath ". Unwilling to pay any more for something he had already bought, Neverember demanded that the artifact be retrieved.</p>
<p>After capturing and interrogating a member of Bloodbath's crew, Neverember's agents determined that the Talon of Umberlee was being kept aboard a floating fortress known as Murdershoal just off the coast from the pirates' base at Port Llast . His underling, Soman Galt , then hired a crew of adventurers to conduct a raid on Murdershoal, and Neverember gave them use of his ship called Neverwinter's Pride for the mission.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Umberlee had no desire to allow such adventurers to claim her artifact, and so sent her sahuagin servant, Baron Saarkrith , alongside a kraken to intercept the artifact and teach them some humility.</p>
