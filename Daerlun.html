<p>Daerlun was a large city in Sembia .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>As of 1368 DR , the city was run by an elderly merchant named Halath Tymmyr , although he was a puppet for the evil commander of the guard, Allathast , who was a member of the Cult of the Dragon .</p>
<p>Circa 1480 DR , Daerlun came under the control of the Netherese Empire along with the rest of Sembia, but was annexed by Cormyr in the Year of the Quill, 1397 DR . The city declared itself a neutral independent city-state in the Year of the Silent Tear, 1439 DR , rather than be absorbed by Cormyr or stay under the direct influence of Sembia.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Daerlun was the most heavily fortified city in Sembia, and boasted the tallest curtain wall on all of Toril . This 500‑foot-tall (150‑meter) wall was made of magically hard obsidian and was erected by the Netherese Empire in the Year of the Black Blazon, 1382 DR . It was garrisoned by a massive army of conscripts from across Sembia, who drilled on massive parade grounds near the city's markets.</p>
<p>Patrols out of Daerlun—mounted on flying griffons or veserabs —ranged as far as the Vast Swamp , the Thunder Peaks , and the southern Dales .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The city had a bustling marketplace and a wealthy trade quarter.</p>
<p>As of the mid-14 th century DR , Daerlunian linen sold for around 8 sp per square yard, while Daerlunian wool sold for between 9 sp and 2 gp per square yard depending on the weight of the fabric. The city imported such commodities as parchment , wine , and wool from Eveningstar in Cormyr.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The evil semi-religious organization, the Cult of the Dragon, had a presence in Daerlun as of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, but preferred a secretive approach, using the city as a place to store armaments and to treat wounded members. The commander of the city guard, Allathast, used the elderly merchant Halath Tymmyr as a puppet to rule the city.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Awakened Sleepers, 1484 DR , the city prepared defenses against a possible Shadovar and Sembian invasion. Rumors abounded in the city about gods, war, and natural disasters.</p>
