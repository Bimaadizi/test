<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR , Haridyn and the Emerald Swords were guests at Thistleflame Keep in Suzail . They conspired to kidnap Lord Partic Thistle and hand him over to Zhentil Keep for questioning, and had Xixis the doppelganger impersonate Lord Thistle to allow them to escape without suspicion. When Xixis risked carelessly ruining the plan, Gandegar Armstrong had Haridyn kill Xixis with a dagger of venom , so that the Lord's murder would cover up his kidnapping. Despite their best attempts at diversion, the Emerald Swords were caught and Lord Thistle rescued. For their murder and kidnapping, they risked exile or execution for their crimes.</p>
