<p>Athalantar (also known as the Realm of the Stag ) whose capital, Hastarl , stood on the site of the settlement of Secomber , was a small human kingdom in the North .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Unicorn Run made its path through the middle of Athalantar, creating rich farmlands on its way to the Delimbiyr in the south where, the capital, Hastarl stood. The northern border of Athalantar was defined by the edge of the High Forest that was slowly expanded by dilligent foresters over the years.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Founded in 183 DR by Uthgrael Aumar , the "Stag King", Athalantar occupied the area just south of what is now the High Forest . The kingdom helped to unite the leaderless farming communities of the area and was well on its way to greatness until the Stag King died in 216 DR . One of the princes, Cauln Aumar , was slain by Rhangaun , a mage from Calimshan , in particular. Eventually after much in-fighting between the princes of the realm the eldest prince, Belaur Aumar , took the throne in 218 DR with the help of powerful wizards (later known as Magelords ).</p>
<p>Prior to Year of the Awakening Magic, 212 DR , the King of Athalantar was gifted an enchanted crown by elves from the High Forest, signifying an acceptance as neighbors. The crown was kept as a treasure, being known later as the Antlered Crown of Athalantar ; it was never in use by a ruler.</p>
<p>In 224 DR , it became apparent that these wizards were the true power behind the throne and once all the other potential claiments to the throne had either been killed or driven from the lands only one prince remained, the youngest, Elminster Aumar . Eventually Undarl arrived in Athalantar with his dragon and destroyed the village of Heldon along with Elminster Aumar's parents.</p>
<p>During their reign, the Magelords captured the beholder Harhoarguh Manyeyes . A magelord always held the rank of Mage Royal : this was Ubriien Orlyn initially, but he died in the Year of the Flaming Forests, 224 DR , during a visit to Morlin Castle where he impersonated an elven highlord. He was replaced by Neldryn Hawklyn , who kept the role until his death in Year of the Black Flame, 229 DR , when he attempted to control the Magister of Mystra , Dorgon Heamiiolothtar . His place was taken by Undarl Dragonrider.</p>
<p>By 240 DR , Elminster returned, now 28, to the capital whereupon he slew both Belaur and the Mage Royal Undarl (who turned out to be a Malaugrym in disguise). Elminster handed rulership over to the outlaw Helm Stoneblade and left on a journey for Cormanthor . A new enchanted sword was provided for Helm Stoneblade at some point during his reign. The reign lasted until at least the Year of the Ghost Horse, 254 DR .</p>
<p>Unfortunately Athalantar was destroyed a century later in 342 DR by an orc horde. However some of its inhabitants eventually merged with the Blue Bear Tribe , with some of their bloodline later breaking off to form the Tree Ghost Tribe , whilst others settled in the area where Baldur's Gate now resides.</p>
<h2>Customs</h2>
<p>The worship of Tyr , Chauntea , Malar , Silvanus , Tyche , Lathander , Helm , and Sune was common. Mystran worship was outlawed during the tenure of the Magelords of Athalantar. Though Selûne was honored in Athalantar, it was not to the same level as the others.</p>
<p>During the realm's existence, Mielikki selected her champion, the Green Regent , from the kingdom of Athalantar several times.</p>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>Athalantar-minted golden coins remained in use to Year of the Prince, 1357 DR . They were most likely called regals in their time, while silver coins were called silver bits.</p>
<p>Another famous sorceress was known in the realm from the times after Elminster : Aerglandra of Athalantar.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Though sages were not forthcoming on the matter, Athalantar was apparently called the Realm of the Stag after a legendary stag-headed sorcerer.</p>
<h2>Other</h2>
<p>At least one of the Kings of Athalantar was named Roreld .</p>
<p>The royal line of Athalantar later touched princess Raedra .</p>
