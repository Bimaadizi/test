<p>The emerald stave was an enchanted artifact staff that once belonged to a yuan-ti Zehirite cultist Il'Foss in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The staff resembled a wearing sinuous snake.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This powerful artifact held a portion of Il'Foss's dark powers and because of that foul influence, only creatures who venerated evil could wield the emerald stave . Those who managed to tap into the weapon's magic received a boon of increased intelligence. The staff also allowed the wielder to create undead once per day and afflict a creature with crushing despair once a day.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , yuan-ti who followed an interloper deity Zehir revealed their sinister intents for the Sword Coast . The yuan-ti House Se'Sehen began attacking the operations of House Sauringar and their Mercantile House trading organization led by Sa'Sani . An attempt on her life took place in the Red Sheaf Inn , a roadside inn east of the city of Neverwinter . The attack was led by a cultist mage Il'Foss who wielded the emerald stave . With the yuan-ti cultist's likely dead, the staff changed hands. Il'Foss's powers still clang to the weapon even after leaving his possessions.</p>
