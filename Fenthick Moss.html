<p>Fenthick Moss was a half-elf cleric of Tyr and the deceased fiance of Aribeth de Tylmarande in the mid-14 th century DR . The pair were known as "the very Sword and Scales of Tyr". He was a colleague to the false Helmite Desther Indelayne .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Fenthick was deemed wise within a peaceful society's choices, but a fool in desperate reality. He was good-natured to the point of not being mature enough as an adult to discern dangerous individuals around him. He even vouched for Desther's innocence when it was obvious the latter's present treachery. His mind was too weak to handle true betrayal; therefore, he sought his responsibility through law and not wisdom, which he was socially known for.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h3>Aribeth de Tylmarande</h3>
<p>He was Aribeth de Tylmarande's fiancé. His unjust death started a chain reaction that led his former fiancée to fall and become a Blackguard .</p>
<h3>Desther Indelayne</h3>
<p>He foolishly sought to redeem the false Helmite Desther Indelayne by following the traitor of Neverwinter , but was killed in the end, ironically, by judicial reasons.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Fenthick sought to find a cure to the Wailing Death . He gave the ward key to his colleague Desther Indelayne to better assist with the magic ceremony to create the cure. However, Desther, secretly an agent of Morag , absconded with the cure once it was created. Fenthick followed Desther to Helm's Hold in the hope of making him recant, but ultimately ended up hanged for his "collaboration" with the false Helmite traitor.</p>
<p>Years later, the spirit of Fenthick could be found in Neverwinter 's Tomb of the Betrayers .</p>
