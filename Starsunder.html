<p>Starsunder was an elf originally of Myth Drannor .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was welcoming, but really wanted his secrets kept.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He wore a blue open-breasted shirt, leather breeches, and high boots. He also had a dark-green half cloak.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He was privy to matters of phaerimm , malaugrym , and sharn .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He was capable of learning about damage to distant forests at will, and knew where a number of portals were. One of his spells or abilities was at the same time defensive and aggressive in use, allowing him to parry away spells and strike down foes with a single casting; the spell-shield could also be turned into a web and hurled at foes.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He had two teardrop-shaped objects hovering near his head.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At the moment of his birth, a fallen star struck the ground and he was named after the event. When he was young, he was a witness to the argument between Coronal Eltargrim Irithyl and Lady Ildilyntra Starym before she attempted to kill him, though he kept the secret close to his chest.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Awakening Wyrm, 767 DR , Starsunder was at Tangletrees , where he met the mage Umbregard of Galadorna . Umbregard was looking for guidance related to Elminster Aumar , who was both the last court mage of his land and a Chosen of Mystra . The grove sacred to Rillifane Rallathil and Sehanine Moonbow judged Umbregard sincere, and Starsunder spoke freely with him. He later took Umbregard to the Lookout Tree , where he explained the tasks before Elminster, and also the risk that Elminster's temptations became suffering for someone else. Afterwards, he took him across the sea to the forest near Starmantle , at the Dead Place , where fires had been used in disregard of the safety of the woods.</p>
<p>In the forest, they met with a number of Sharran Dreadspells , who attacked them. Though Umbregard and Starsunder fought, they only prevailed at great cost, with Umbregard injured, and thanks to the timely intervention of Tenthar Taerhamoos , a foe of his guest. Both Starsunder and Umbregard tried to heal Starsunder afterwards. They stabilized him sufficiently for Elminster Aumar to arrive and heal the elf; afterwards, all four had some wine for a toast.</p>
