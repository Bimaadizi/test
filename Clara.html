<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Clara had a rather unremarkable early life growing up on a farm. Some time later she moved to the city of Athkatla with the hopes of becoming a stage actress. After earning a meager living as a courtesan for some time, she learned some thieving skills and embarked upon the life that accompanied them.</p>
<p>As of early Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR she was imprisoned by the Flaming Fist within their headquarters in Baldur's Gate .</p>
<p>She traveled back to Athkatla later that year, and was subsequently dominated by the vampire Hexxat . The vampire compelled Clara to stay at the Copper Coronet tavern in order to find a group to aid her. Referring to herself as 'Hexxat', Clara sought to journey into the tomb of the being known as Dragomir the Red . She promised prospective guardians they could find great treasure within the tomb.</p>
