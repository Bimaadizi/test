<p>The Mighty Servant of Leuk-o was a powerful, pilotable construct of extra- Torillian origin.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Mighty Servant was a enigmatic, otherworldly machine that resembled something of a cross between a stout humanoid and a giant beetle . It stood 10 ft (3 m) tall, was almost 5 ft (1.5 m) wide at its broadest point, and weighed over 2 tons (1,800 kg). The Servant was constructed from some glistening, black metallic alloy; dark, shadowed crystals ; and fibrous substance of unknown origin.</p>
<p>The interior of the device was accessible by means of a large hatch on its 'back', and controls for its operation were found within. It held enough space for the two crew members needed to pilot it along with 1 ton (910 kg) of cargo.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Mighty Servant of Leuk-o was a powerful construct that was immune to numerous harmful effects including fire, acid, psychic assault, radiant or necrotic energy , among others. Its form could not be altered by any magical means and it could not be shifted to another plane of existence . Additionally it was resistant to all forms of magic, along with damage caused by weapons that slashed or pierced opponents, and had a natural form of regeneration .</p>
<p>The pilot of the Mighty Servant could perform a number of astounding maneuvers, such as a 20 ft (6.1 m) tall high jump or 50 ft (15 m) long jump from a standing position. Either one of these bounding actions could easily knock over any nearby creatures upon impact.</p>
<h3>Combat</h3>
<p>It could also engage in enhance hand–to–giant metal fist combat, unleashing a powerful attack that could shatter other constructs with ease.</p>
<p>If needed, the pilots could engage a "self-destruct" sequence of the Mighty Servant using a specific code and a series of control manipulations. This would spark an enormous concussive blast of lighting. Interestingly enough, this did not outright destroy the construct. Rather, the individual limbs and pieces of the Mighty Servant would subsequently fall from the sky within a 1,000 mi (1,600 km) radius of the explosion. If these pieces were brought in close contact with the others, they would rejoin and built the Servant anew.</p>
<h3>Operations</h3>
<p>Circa the era following the Second Sundering , two individuals were said to be able to attune to the Mighty Servant at a time. This process took approximately two hours.</p>
<p>The spirit of the machine's former master Leuk-o , became bound to the device following his death. Even when operators were attuned to it, the Mighty Servant could still take independent actions when willed by the deceased Leuk-o. If it suffered significant harm, it was possible Leuk-o would cause the Servant to go on a terrible rampage, destroying anything in its path.</p>
<p>Specifications regarding the Mighty Servant along with its operations could be found within the artificer 's tome entitled the Mind of Metal .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Mighty Servant was named for a famous warlord named Leuk-o , a follower of the infamous Lum the Mad . Leuk-o turned against Lum after coming across the Servant and saw its destructive force as terrifying means to wage war in his lands. The armies of the two men engaged in a horrific battle, destroying an entire kingdom in the process. Some said that the Mighty Servant was destroyed while others believed it had been sucked through some dimensional portal .</p>
<p>Regardless of the Servant's fate following the battle, the construct remained in pieces for some unknown amount of time. It was eventually reassembled by Lum the Maestro , the descendent of Lum the Mad.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>The Mighty Servant of Leuk-o was believed to have originated from the Olman people from Barrier Peaks region of Oerth . It came from the same world as the Machine of Lum the Mad and the two were said to be somehow related.</p>
<p>Some sages attributed the Mighty Servant to dwarven craftsmanship, though dwarf historians have no recorded mention of the the machine in their texts.</p>
