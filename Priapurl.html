<p>Priapurl ( pronounced : / p r aɪ ɑː ˈ p ɜːr l / pry-ah-PURL ) was a small town located on the Trader's Road .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>As of 1372 DR , the ruler of Priapurl was Tar Hurara , who had descended from bandits but was often away from the town spending her time in the court of Cormyr .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR , Priapurl became besieged by a one- orc army Slogg Ogrum . Slogg by his lonesome managed to almost bring the town to its knees if not for the Mindulgulph Mercenary Company , who eventually slew the threat. Disturbingly enough, no-one even uncovered the reason for the orc's attack. His impressive stash of powerful weapons was the only thing recovered from the siege, including the powerful crossbow – Ogrum's Siegebow .</p>
