<p>Ammaratha Cyndusk was a song dragon , and the mother of Narnra Shalace by Elminster .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early life</h3>
<p>Ammaratha's early life was not known; what was known about her came mainly by way of Elminster and their daughter Narnra. [ speculation ]</p>
<p>Around 1300 DR , Ammaratha adventured in the form of a human sorceress , using the pseudonym Maerjanthra Shalace . She eventually settled in Waterdeep, where she became a jeweler for the nobility, and became known as Lady Maerjanthra of the Gems .</p>
<p>During this time, she became one of Elminster's many occasional lovers. Eventually, she decided to bear him a child, which presented a problem: as a Chosen of Mystra , Elminster had conscious control over his own fertility. She decided to go to her lover's fellow Chosen, Khelben Arunsun , to get a spell to let her conceive. Arunsun at first refused, but then the goddess Mystra herself intervened, commanding the Blackstaff to grant the request.</p>
<h3>Life in Cormyr</h3>
<p>After fleeing Waterdeep, she settled in the city of Marsember in Cormyr , where she took the name Lady Joysil Ambrur , presenting herself as a wealthy Sembian merchant noble.</p>
<p>She was last seen with former Mage Royal Vangerdahast in 1373 DR , who forced her into stasis in draconic form alongside him. This was part of a plan by Vangerdahast to bind metallic dragons in an extradimensional space, replacing the fallen Lords Who Sleep as the hidden guardians of Cormyr.</p>
<h3>15th century</h3>
<p>She remained in stasis with Vangey, later joined also by Myrmeen Lhal , until a large army of shadovar arcanists led by a prince of shade attacked their resting place in 1487 DR . During the battle, the shadovar were defeated thanks to the ghost of Alusair Obarskyr , but Ammaratha died in the fighting.</p>
<h2>Home</h2>
<p>In Marsember, as Joysil Ambrur, she dwelled at the Haelithtorntowers mansion.</p>
