<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Fist Borleas answered a complaint from Battrick Degronce in the Lower City. The gnome complained about the stench of decay around Philgrave's Mansion . Fist Borleas tried to convince Battrick that the stench was nothing but a clogged sewer and that he would file a report requesting the sewer's eventual cleanup. However, Battrick was correct in his suspicions that the stench was coming from the mansion. It was the lair of Mystic Carrion and his undead servants.</p>
