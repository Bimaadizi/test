<p>Sledgehammers , or sledges , were heavy, practical hammers commonly used as tools in the Realms .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sledges were large, heavy, well-balanced hammers.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Sledgehammers were widely used in construction and masonry.</p>
<p>Sledges were used with wedges to split wood. Cording mallets were a one-piece version of a sledge and wedge that used an axe -like head for chopping wood.</p>
<p>Striker's sledges were used in blacksmithing for hammering metal during heavy forging.</p>
<p>Sledgehammers could be used as melee weapons, but they were too slow and cumbersome to be practical in anything but an emergency. The maul was a martial-focused version used for breaking through heavy armor . Tomb tappers used sledges as their primary tool and weapon, and were strong and large enough to use them effectively.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ondeth Obarskyr 's iconic sledge was placed with his body on his funeral pyre in the Year of Opening Doors, 26 DR . The scorched metal head of that sledgehammer was later kept in storage among other Cormyrean treasures.</p>
