<p>Limbrar was a monk of Ilmater who served as one of leaders of the Knights of Imphras II as well as a member of the Lords of Imphras II during the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>For many years, Limbrar and his fellow lords Helimbraun and Oriseus formed a strong triumvirate, often agreeing and deciding upon what they felt was best for the nation.</p>
<p>However, as Lord Helimbraun became more zealous and fervent in his quest to "root out evil" from Impiltur, especially after the coronation of King Imbrar II , Limbrar became the most outspoken opponent of his friend and colleague.</p>
