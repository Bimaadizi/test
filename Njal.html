<p>Njal was a dwarf and part of a valiant group who defended Dead Dwarf Bridge against forces from Narfell who hoped to invade Almorel .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A wizard from Narfell cast a spell upon Njal, forcing him to attack his fellow dwarves. The ensuing fight resulted in Molnir and Njal tumbling to their deaths into the Clearflow River river far below.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Njal would appear as a haunt on the bridge, but only when either Theodo Greataxe or Molnir were also present. Still under the influence of the wizard's spell, even in undeath, Njal would try to possess any living creature in order to attack Theodo or Molnir.</p>
