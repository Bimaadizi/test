<p>The Shadowtop Glade was a shrine to Eilistraee in the northern part of Velarswood , near Harrowdale .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The shrine consisted of two series of caverns located on both sides of a steep-sided gully. It was named after a grove of shadowtop trees that surrounded the place.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>A group of about fifty followers of Eilistraeen, drow and other elves , dwelt in the shrine.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>

<p>Eilistraeen priestesses and moon-worshiping lycanthropes from the nearby Howling Hill joined together in sacred hunts to Eilistraee and Sel√ªne when the moon was full. They also often danced the personal and intimate evensong , in gratitude to their goddess.</p>
