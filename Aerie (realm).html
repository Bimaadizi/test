<p>The Aerie was the divine realm of the elven goddess of air , weather and avians, Aerdrie Faenya , which she shared with Syranita , goddess of the aarakocra . Among the latter the place was known as Whistledge .</p>
<h2>Cosmography</h2>
<p>In the Great Wheel cosmology , the Aerie could shift according to their deities' whims between the joint realm of the Seldarine in Arvandor and the homestead of more chaotic-minded elven petitioners , Alfheim . The former was part of Arborea 's first layer (also called Arvandor ); the latter lay in Ysgard 's first layer (also named Ysgard ).</p>
<p>In the World Tree cosmology , the realm was located within the plane of Arvandor.</p>
<p>In either case, it floated above the breathtaking landscapes inhabited by the earth-bound petitioners.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Aerie consisted of cloudy islands covered with double-topped trees and crowned by a bright aerial palace. It could be approached by means of flight, but even that was often difficult due to prevailing strong winds.</p>
