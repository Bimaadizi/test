<p>A wand of portraiture was a magical wand that, when used in conjunction with a set of crystal balls, was capable of recording an image of the area surrounding the wielder.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>To function as intended, an individual was required to hold both the wand in one hand and the crystal sphere in another.</p>
<p>When the wand was held and the first command word of "ready" was uttered, a small sphere of faint light appeared a distance away as determined by the wielder. Using the commanders "bigger" and "smaller" , the sphere grew or diminished in size, a variable which determined the scope and focus of the resulting effect. When the desired size of the light was reached, the wielder of the wand completed the process with the word "flash" . After which, the sphere of light disappeared and an image of its surroundings were embedded into the crystalline ball.</p>
