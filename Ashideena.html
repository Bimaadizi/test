<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This warhammer possessed a +2 enchantment that shocked any person or creature it struck.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The hammer was originally wielded by Dergat Wiltoon , a grave warrior who served as the Field Captain of Lady Ashideena. The two served together during the entire conflict that surrounded the Black Horde ravaging the lands of the North , the Sword Coast and the Lands of Intrigue in the Year of the Black Horde, 1235 DR .</p>
<p>Following the war, Lady Ashideena and Dergat fell in love with one another and eventually got married. It was rumored that Dergat named his weapon after his bride as a reminder of their love and how hard he had fought to preserve it in the face of war.</p>
<p>At some point prior to the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR Ashideena or its copy came into the possession of the deranged Cyricist cleric , Bassilus . The same year, another such hammer was sold by Magda , a merchant from Baeloth Barrityl 's Black Pits in the Underdark and another wielded by Voadikka , a fighter at the arena. At some point long before 1368 DR , another Ashideena was stashed near a temple dedicated to Amaunator underneath the Temple District of Athkatla . Another replica could be found in use around the gladiatorial arena in Thay run by Dennaton , a Red Wizard .</p>
