<h2>History</h2>
<p>The jester's bracers were originally a standard pair of protective bracers owned by a traveling bard famous for his quick wit and sharp tongue. While performing at a rickety inn on the road to Shadowdale one rainy night, he drew the ire of an old woman in the audience. She exclaimed, "You think it clever to insult and belittle others? Do so, then, for as long as you live!", thereby cursing the bard's bracers. He was forced to consult a wizard to have them removed.</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , the jester's bracers were owned by the djinni merchant Nazramu .</p>
