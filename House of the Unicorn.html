<p>There were hidden passages in the place. One of the rooms was the Redshield Chamber . There were also jakes. One passage leading to the bedroom taken by Elminster had a parallel passage that, in the opposite direction, led to a sequence of dark, neglected chambers, which terminated at a shrine to Bane in a high-ceilinged room sporting a tapestry as tall as a cottage. The room had flagstone floors, pews, a Black Hand of Bane , and two guardian helmed horrors .</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The House of the Unicorn was the dwelling of King Baerimgrim until the Year of Mistmaidens, 764 DR , when he tried to name a successor. His Court Mage, Ilgrist , killed him shortly after the successor was named and styled himself King Nadrathen of Galadorna. His reign was cut short when the Chosen of Mystra Elminster Aumar fought with him, allowing his master, the sorceress Dasumia , to slay Nadrathen. She then crowned herself Queen of Galadorna, with Elminster as seneschal.</p>
<p>Dasumia remained queen until later into the year, when she revealed to Elminster she was actually Mystra , and the two of them left Galadorna.</p>
