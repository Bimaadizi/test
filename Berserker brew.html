<p>Berserker brew was a potent alcoholic beverage known in the Utter East during the Bloodforge Wars ( 648 â€“ 657 DR ).</p>
<p>Kept in a skin flask, a full draft was enough to send a living imbiber flying into a berserk fury , enhancing their combat prowess but at a terrible cost. Attacking all enemies in sight, they moved faster and hit harder, could not be noticeably harmed by attackers, and were immune to fear. However, they also could not be healed, by either healing spells , healing salve , or even a boar burger . The berserker brew also slowly killed them.</p>
