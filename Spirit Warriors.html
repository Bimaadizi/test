<p>The Spirit Warriors were a group of Lesser Immortals of the Celestial Bureaucracy , the dominant faith of Kara-Tur . They served Chan Cheng , the god of war.</p>
<p>The Spirit Warriors had the duties of creating courage and resolve in those who wavered, and leading armies of phantoms, the manifestation of which could swing a battle. Spirit Warriors also helped those who'd fallen in battle for a good cause, escorted the spirits of heroes for judgement by the Lords of Karma , and guarded the gates of the Underworld against trespassers.</p>
