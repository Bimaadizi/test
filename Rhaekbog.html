<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , the town of Targos in Icewind Dale became besieged by the Legion of the Chimera. One of the Legion's surprise attacks involved teleporting goblins from underground tunnels into the Targos docks. A group of goblin sappers made it into the basement of one of the warehouses in the docks with the aid of an insider—a Luskanite mage named Phaen of the Rags . When Phaen's treachery was uncovered, the wizard transported a group of goblins to attack adventuring defenders of Targos. Rhaekbog was among the goblins that came to the wizard's aid and died in the process.</p>
