<p>Sinnafain (also spelled Sinnafein ) was an elf in the Moonwood who married the drow renegade Tos'un Armgo . She was also the leader of the elves of the Moonwood .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>As leader of the elves of the Moonwood, Sinnafain was sympathetic to groups (such as Casin Cu Calas ) that killed or harassed orcs in protest of the Kingdom of Many-Arrows . She often pardoned these vigilantes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Sinnafain's first encounter with her future husband, Tos'un Armgo , his sword, Khazid'hea , persuaded him to attack her, but he refrained from hurting or killing her. The two later married and had two children, Teirflin and Doum'wielle Armgo , while living in the Moonwood .</p>
<p>At some point, Tos'un started a "contest" between his children for one of them to win possession of Khazid'hea . Doum'wielle won and killed her brother in 1484 DR after he attempted to take it from her. She fled and her parents followed. Along the way, they were pursued by orcs. Tos'un, apparently having reverted to his old ways, slashed Sinnafain's legs and left her for dead. However, instead of killing her, the orcs captured her and Lorgru traded her back to the Moonwood for political clout.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Sinnafain was married to Tos'un Armgo for decades. She had two children with him: Teirflin and Doum'wielle Armgo . Teirflin was killed by Doum'wielle just prior to Tos'un slashing Sinnafain's legs and joining Doum'wielle in her journey to the Underdark.</p>
