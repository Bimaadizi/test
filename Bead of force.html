<p>A bead of force was an explosive magic item that created a temporary, lightweight magical prison in the wake of its detonation.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Typical beads of force were small black spheres measuring 0.75 inches (1.9 centimeters) in diameter and weighing 1 ounce (28 grams) each. It was common to find a small number of such spheres together.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A bead of force could be thrown out to a distance of up to 60 feet (18 meters), detonating on impact in a blast radius of 10 feet (3 meters). Anyone in the area was damaged by the pure magical energy of the explosion. Those that were capable of resisting the brunt of the damage were pushed away, but those that could not were trapped in a sphere of magical force similar to an Otiluke's resilient sphere for up to 1 minute, although some versions of the beads could last for up to 10 minutes.</p>
<p>The spherical prison could be pushed or picked up. It weighed only 1 pound (450 grams), regardless of its contents. The sphere was impenetrable to all materials and effects, except for breathable air . It could only be destroyed by a rod of cancellation , a rod of negation , a disintegrate spell , or a dispel magic spell.</p>
