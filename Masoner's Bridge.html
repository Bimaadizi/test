<p>Masoner's Bridge was the name of the crossing over the Immerflow on the East Way in Cormyr , just before the road entered Hullack Forest .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>Close to Masoner's Bridge, on a wooded hillside, was a small mausoleum built of stone that housed the bones of one Chancsozbur , a man who'd once foolishly tried to swindle Manshoon of the Zhentarim some time in the 14 th century DR . The tomb was built by Lord Chess of Zhentil Keep , who, on Manshoon's orders, seized Chancsozbur's holdings and sold them off to fund the construction, then had his men slay Chancsozbur's kin when they came. Thereafter, the Zhentarim controlled the tomb and used the upper level as a smuggling waystation, whilst Manshoon stored some of his clones in the lower level. Chancsozbur's stone coffin could be rotated to give access to the lower level.</p>
