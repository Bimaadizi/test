<p>The Griffon , or the Griffon Cup , was rowdy drinking establishment in the village of Ravilar's Cloak , Turmish .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Bar brawls were the most popular local pastime, and with only two taverns in the city, both the Griffon and the Dog and Bone , often provided such entertainment. A pile of drunken commoners pushing their way out of the Griffon and pummeling each other on the street was a common sight in Ravilar's Cloak. Although the Griffon was a slightly more expensive and nicer establishment than the Dog and Bone, it never stopped the miners from starting brawls.</p>
