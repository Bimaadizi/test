<p>A phoenix , or phoenix nobilus conflagrata (sacred, or fiery phoenix) , was a powerful elemental bird that embodied the wild and unpredictable nature of fire .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Phoenixes were enormous birds with brightly colored feathers ranging from orange to red and violet, and blue-violet beaks and claws. Their talons had the consistency of diamonds . Their eyes were a glowing ruby color. A phoenix's body was naturally bright and shed its own light.</p>
<p>Phoenix bodies were almost immaterial, composed of flame taken solid shape. For that reason, they were capable of passing through extremely narrow passages and of engulfing opponents within their fiery bodies.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Phoenixes were described by many sages as champions of good , and by others as random agents of destruction. Most accounts agreed that phoenixes were reclusive creatures that did not seek out contact or conflict with other creatures, but, if disturbed, provoked, or properly motivated, showed relentless fury and destructive power.</p>
<p>Phoenixes had a fierce hatred toward undead and attacked them on sight.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The eyes of these creatures were capable of seeing in total darkness and low-light conditions , as well as the infrared and ultraviolet spectrums . With the latter two senses, they had a visual range of 120 feet (37 meters) and 200 yards (180 meters) respectively. They were practically impossible to sneak up on or surprise.</p>
<p>Their bodies were capable of withstanding incredibly severe cold and heat.</p>
<h3>Innate Abilities</h3>
<p>Phoenixes possessed an incredibly wide array of magical abilities. They were capable of near instantaneously detecting the presence of charms , evil , and magic . Their bodies radiated an effect similar to protection from evil in a radius of out to 10 feet (3 meters). They could make themselves ethereal, allowing them to travel either ethereally or astrally.</p>
<p>The touch of their wings gave off an effect similar to cure light wounds and a touch of their comb gave off one similar to cure disease . Whenever their blood was spilled, a phoenix could make its droplets act as fire seeds . By spreading their wings and uttering a call they could dispel illusion or dispel magic . By performing a dance they unleashed an incredibly powerful exorcism .</p>
<p>In severe situations a phoenix could create a fire storm and incendiary cloud , which would destroy them in the process and leave a gem-like egg that would hatch into a new phoenix within twenty days.</p>
<p>Phoenixes possessed no offensive psionic abilities and could not be harmed by them, though they typically had a handful of disciplinary powers. They could use cell adjustment once per day, energy control and molecular agitation three times per day, as well as probability travel once per week.</p>
<h3>Spellcasting</h3>
<p>In addition to all of the previously mentioned abilities, phoenixes were capable of casting a wide array of spells that included affect normal fires , audible glamer , blink , blindness blur , continual light , Control temperature, 10' radius , dancing lights , find traps , fire charm , fire shield , invisibility , misdirection , produce fire , pyrotechnics , remove curse , remove fear within a 10‑foot (3‑meter) radius, and snake charm at will.

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>In combat, phoenixes were fierce adversaries with no fear of a fight to the death, especially since their rebirth was assured. Though their physical attacks were quite fast and powerful, they often preferred to use their large array of innate magical effects.</p>
<p>Phoenixes were extremely effective at destroying buildings and structures.</p>
<p>If a phoenix was slain in combat, its body exploded in a violent detonation that destroyed the phoenix and most of its surroundings.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<h3>Homelands</h3>
<p>Phoenixes could be found in the deepest reaches of the Elemental Plane of Fire and in remote locations in Elysium .</p>
<p>As reclusive creatures, they tended to avoid contact with others.</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>In addition to being capable of speaking with all species of bird, phoenixes communicated with other creatures through empathy and telepathy .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>All phoenixes were male. They had extremely long lifespans, estimated to be between 1,000 and 12,000 years, and their reproduction process consisted entirely of self-immolation and rebirth. The ashes left behind by a slain phoenix included an extremely hot cinder egg that weighed 5 pounds (2.3 kilograms). The egg was completely immune to all forms of damage. After a few days, it hatched into a new phoenix.</p>
<h3>Uses</h3>
<p>Phoenixes were among the most sought-after creatures by sages and alchemists . Virtually all parts of their bodies could be used as ingredients for potions or in magical research. A phoenix's feathers could be employed in the creation of a staff of healing and in powerful potions of healing . Other body parts, such as eyes, beaks, and talons, could also fetch high prices, but many cultures considered slaying a phoenix to be a bad omen.</p>
<p>The fire wings spell required an amulet in the shape of a phoenix as its material component .</p>
<p>A phoenix's feather, when used as an additional component of a raise dead spell, granted additional powers to its magic. In addition to extending the time window since the creature's death during which the spell was effective, it was capable of extending the life of a creature that had died of old age by one year.</p>
<p>A potion called the phoenix extract was rumored to have been concocted using phoenix blood. When imbibed, it granted the boon of elemental shield against flames.</p>
<h3>Relations</h3>
<p>A rare intelligent species of firebirds found in the Blade Kingdoms were distantly related to phoenixes and shared a language . They were known for loud screeching that could crack mortar and kleptomaniac love for gems and jewelry .</p>
<h2>Notable Phoenixes</h2>
<p>The spire of Howler's Crag located in Cocytus , the second layer of Pandemonium , was built atop the grave of a phoenix deity who held the secret to reincarnation. Its opponents killed the phoenix out of envy and cast its body in Pandemonium. The latent divine magic of the phoenix granted the place its magical properties.</p>
<p>A phoenix was also said to inhabit the vast desert of Mithardir , the third layer of Arborea . Its nest was said to become a pillar of fire at night.</p>
