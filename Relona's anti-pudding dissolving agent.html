<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1490 DR, a notoriously dangerous elder black pudding took residence in the noxious cave that served as the exit drain of Luskan's sewers . The elder was so old its body became too thick and aged to be damaged with any weapons or magic. Relona of Relona's Potions enrolled the Champion of the Burning Dawn 's aid in collecting samples of oozes and jellies that lived in the city's sewers. She used the samples to develop Relona's anti-pudding dissolving agent . The agent worked flawlessly, eating away at the elder pudding's aged armor, making it vulnerable and letting the Champion of the Burning Dawn exterminate the giant terrifying ooze.</p>
