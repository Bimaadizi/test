<p>Iligh√¥n was one of two islands, along with Wavecrest , that made up the Eyes of Silvanus in the Sea of Fallen Stars . It was situated close to the mouth of the Vilhon Reach and benefited from the protection of reefs as well as the magic of the Emerald Enclave .</p>
<p>The island was accessible via a gap in the reef, known as the Farshore Straits . This passageway was guarded by the Seven Sentinels of Silvanus , a group of water and air elementals who acted upon the direction of the enclave.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<h3>Magic nullification</h3>
<p>A unique property of the island was that it naturally negated all arcane magic . If a wizard were to cast any magic on the island it would immediately fizzle into nothingness; this included spells that may have been cast prior to arrival such as stoneskin or contingency . Any scrolls , rods , staves or other items with magical charges would cease to function and their use would ultimately be a waste of magical energy.</p>
<p>Divine magic was unaffected in this way, rather the island possessed a faith-magic zone , which improved the effects of certain magic of the gods. Although the nature of this boon wasn't fully known to the mortals of Toril , it was believed to have been a gift from the goddess Mystra to Silvanus .</p>
