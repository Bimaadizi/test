<p>Delzoun , also known as the Northkingdom , was a great dwarven nation of the North during the Age of the Proud People , reigning over the north for almost 4,000 years, from −3900 DR to −100 DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>At the height of their influence and strength, the kingdom extended from the Ice Mountains south to the River Rauvin and Nether Mountains .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>The name survives as a middle name among modern day dwarves, one bearing much prestige.</p>
<h3>Culture</h3>
<p>The Dirge of Delzoun was an epic dwarven ballad that recounted tales of the kingdom's mightiest heroes and greatest treasures.</p>
<h3>Trade</h3>
<p>Like their kin from Ammarindar to the south in the Greypeak Mountains , the dwarves of Delzoun were masterful smiths and stone masons.</p>
<p>Much of the Delzoun wealth was gained by trading with the Netherese humans , though they were also known trading allies of the elven realms of Illefarn and Eaerlann . They notably created the Fardrimm , a series of underground roads spanning the breadth of their empire and beyond into other areas of the North. The most famous of these underground roads was the Lowroad , which linked the Delzoun lands with Netheril . Dwarves of Delzoun would often trade gems , ironworks and weapons for gold and arcane secrets from the magocratic empire.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The kingdom was founded by a dwarf of the same name.</p>
<p>The dwarves completed construction of Citadel Felbarr in −1900 DR .</p>
<p>The Illuskan Maerin commissioned a number of Delzoun artisans, including Immar Fardelver , to construct Gauntlgrym in −335 DR .</p>
<p>Citadel Sundbarr and Ascalhorn accepted human refugees from the recently fallen Netheril in −333 DR . In the same year, the dwarves began to slowly abandon Ascore .</p>
<p>In the Year of Terrible Anger, -111 DR , the Delzoun fell prey to the same orc assaults that devastated other kingdoms of the North, though the kingdom endured for few more years. Finally, in −100 DR , Delzoun fell to the phaerimms and other dangers. Surface settlements including Citadel Adbar , Citadel Felbarr, Mithral Hall , and Sundabar survived the fall but the underground settlements of the Northdark were not so fortunate.</p>
