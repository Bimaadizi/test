<p>Arrows of Direction were enchanted arrows that could be used as locate object spells.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Though an Arrow of Direction looked like any other ordinary arrow, it could be tossed into the air once per day by anyone, and would fall and point to the requested location. For about one minute one could then throw the arrow again and again, gauging the direction to travel.</p>
<p>The arrows could only point to the location of the nearest stairway, sloping passage, exit, entrance, or closest cavern. When tossing the arrow the first time one requested the distance and/or direction, making the arrows far more useful inside caverns or dungeons than outside in the wilderness.</p>
