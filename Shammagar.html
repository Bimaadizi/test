<p>Shammagar was a black dragon who lived on an island in the Trackless Sea .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Rage of Dragons of 1018 DR , Shammagar and the green dragon Claugiyliamatar attacked the orcs of Uruth Ukrypt , targeting the horde's food supplies and amassed treasure. Shammagar himself drove the orcs out of the ancient dwarven stronghold of Melairrin beneath Mount Sar in the Sword Mountains range.</p>
<p>Several centuries later, the half-elven Harper Asilther Graelor managed to infiltrate Shammagar's lair beneath Mount Sar and abscond with most of his hoard. Shammagar was outraged and immediately abandoned Melairrin for a new island lair in the Trackless Sea. The dragon vowed revenge, but could not confront Asilther directly as she had learned Shammagar's true name from Mirt the Moneylender (who in turn had learned it from Elminster ). Nevertheless, it was said that Shammagar and Asilther reached an accord whereby she would restore the hoard—twice over—over a period of many years. It was even said that Asilther turned to privateering to pay back her debt, running at least one Luskar pirate ship aground on Shammagar's island.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The frost giant adventurer Harshnag the Grim , who came to reside in the stronghold of Melairrin long after Shammagar had quit the place, reported encountering half–black dragons of orcish ancestry in the depths below—possibly the progeny of Shammagar himself.</p>
