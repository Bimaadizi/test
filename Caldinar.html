<p>Caldinar the Wily was a keen-witted but suspicious mage and an adventurer , active some years before the late 13 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Caldinar was known for creating a collection of enchanted items to aid himself out of a high spot. His paranoid nature ensured that the items were numerous and diverse. One such item from a girdle of ogre blood made out of an ogre 's tanned hide and infused with the creature's black blood. Caldinar was often found using the magic belt in adventures until his death some years before the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR . Soon after, Caldinar's adventuring companions auctioned his girdle of ogre blood off.</p>
