<p>Permidion Stark was a thief and burglar who operated on the Sword Coast in the second half of the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Permidion carried a typical thief's gear: a set of leather armor , a short sword , a bow , a couple dozen arrows , and a singular gemstone .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Permidion set his sights on the High Hedge northwest of Beregost —the abode of the wizard Thalantyr . The thief salivated, thinking of all the precious magical trinkets just laying around the laboratory, but eventually decided against the heist. The big-time wizard had two powerful flesh golems guarding the place, invulnerable to non-magical damage, and the High Hedge had no shadows to hide in. Eventually, Permidion Stark set off to find a halfling village to harass, leaving High Hedge behind.</p>
