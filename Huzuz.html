<p>Huzuz was Zakhara 's greatest city and the golden religious and commercial epicenter of an entire continent. It was the place where the first Grand Caliph had the vision of the Loregiver , gaining Fate 's wisdom and the Law . The city remained the seat of the Grand Caliph, the centermost hub of the enlightened lands. Its ruler in 1367 DR , Grand Caliph Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir , Master of the Enlightened Throne, Most High Sovereign of the Land of Fate, the Worthy of the Gods, Scourge of the Unbeliever, Confidant of the Genies, was the most powerful man in Zakhara and therefore one of the most powerful men on all of Al-Toril .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Golden Huzuz was located at the narrow straits between the Golden Gulf and the southern end of Suq Bay along the south bank of Al-Sarif River , practically in the center of the continent of Zakhara.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Huzuz was a large city. 800,000 permanent residents lived there, and at any time there were an additional 200,000-800,000 visitors, pilgrims, and tourists inhabiting the city as well.</p>
<p>Many of Huzuz's domed roofs and towers were decked with gold, tile, and inlaid glass, sparkling in the sun. The city positively glowed, giving it the title Huzuz the Golden. The spectacular view of its gleaming spires could be seen for miles across the waters of Suq Bay. Notable features among its renown architecture included the Palace of the Grand Caliph , the Public Gardens, and the Grand Bazaar . Its Golden Mosque was the object of pilgrimage of most Zakharans . The city was known for its far-ranging merchants, universities , sages , and textiles. Tourism was also a considerable source of revenue, especially visits to the Grand Mosque and the Court of Enlightenment .</p>
<p>Vast stretches of farmland surrounded the City of Delights, taking advantage of the fertile land provided by Al-Sarif River. All farms and estates found within one mile (1.6 km) of the city were taxed. Because of this tax, many large estates sat just outside of that distance. However, estates found beyond the taxable distance were not guaranteed the protection of mighty Huzuz and her guards.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<h3>Influence of the Loregiver</h3>
<p>Though Zakharans tolerated other religions, the presence of the House of the Loregiver within Huzuz inspired them to try to convert non-believers to Enlightenment through their actions. The word of the Loregiver required them to be hospitable to others–a difficult task considering the sheer multitude of pilgrims flowing through Huzuz on a yearly basis. Still, most natives of Huzuz were very charitable to those who looked like they could use a helping hand.</p>
<p>Every follower of Enlightenment on the continent of Zakhara was expected to make a pilgrimage to Huzuz at some point during their life. Because of this, the citizens of Huzuz strove to keep their city clean and beautiful in order to impress the flood of pilgrims.</p>
<h3>Influence of the Grand Caliph</h3>
<p>The citizens of Huzuz enjoyed the presence of the Grand Caliph in their city, for he was a beloved man. Any visitor to Huzuz who spoke out against the Grand Caliph, or slandered his name in any way, would quickly make enemies. The Grand Caliph was considered to be a wise and charitable man, and his people loved him for it.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>While the Grand Caliph ruled most of Zakhara through local potentates, Huzuz was his personal domain, which he governed through a large bureaucracy of trusted advisers centered within the Court of Enlightenment. Aside from the main court, three bureaucratic centers existed within the city. These could be found in the Northwest District , Central District , and Affluent District .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The Gem of Zakhara lay at the crossroads of several important trade routes: Sea lanes came in from the east and south on their way to Zakhara's northern cities and beyond. Caravan routes brought goods from the Haunted Lands , the Cities of the Pantheon and the Ruined Kingdoms . All kinds of items from Zakhara and beyond were traded in Huzuz’s Caravan District and especially its Grand Bazaar, arguably the largest market in the Land of Fate. There was no sanctioned place for trading slaves in the city, but they still could be had for those willing to pay.</p>
<p>Huzuz itself was know for its textile production, but its main export was not in goods but services: It had a number of universities and many a Zakharan sage gained their knowledge there. And of course, as the seat of the Grand Caliph it furnished the backbone of the bureaucracy for the governance of his empire.</p>
<p>Lastly, many of the people of Huzuz earned their dinars by catering to the vast number of guests that visited the city for reasons of religion, business or leisure at any given time.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The City of Delights was protected by a large military force in 1367 DR under the less-than-able leadership of Prince Cheddah al-Assad . It was kept in good order by the more competent leaders of its subdivisions:</p>
<p>The City of Delights was also completely encompassed by city walls whose gates were faithfully guarded by mamluks of the Vigilant . These fortifications lacked the strength found in Zakhara's northern cities, but Huzuz' greatest protection lay elsewhere: Close ties to all of the genie races ensured the help of a most formidable force should the Gem of Zakhara come under attack. And the authority of the Grand Caliphs was such that few would even contemplate such an act against the Land of Fate's enlightened culture.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to legend, the Loregiver herself once lived in a house at the location of the city. Around 800 DR , when Huzuz was still only a minor trading village, an al-Badia boy had a vision there that let him discover scrolls of wisdom penned by the Loregiver. The inhabitants of Huzuz were among the first to embrace these new teachings and follow the leadership of the youth who was to become the first Grand Caliph. The Golden Mosque was built around the house of the vision, and the Palace of Enlightenment, constructed and reconstructed over the course of 500 years, has remained the seat of all following Grand Caliphs.</p>
<p>The tenth in the line of the Grand Caliphs formed close ties with the genie races. Much later, on the 12th of Nau in 1327 DR , an army of a renegade al-Badia sheik attacked the City of Delights and was annihilated by a great force of different genies called by the then-ruling sixteenth Grand Caliph, Bahamal al-Assad . This obliteration of the invading army discouraged open attacks on the city for generations to come.</p>
