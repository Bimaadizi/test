<p>The Butler's Cane Has a Knob on the End was a farcical comedy novel , penned sometime before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>The novel's protagonist was the butler Vincent Raspington: a stiff-mannered and silly dragonborn man, who often was flummoxed over the romantic behaviors of noble ladies and their suitors. The dragonborn found himself in a comedy of errors with the nobles going "arse-over-teakettle" into lewd situations. One such erotic misadventure forced the massive dragonborn butler to pretend he was a timid gnome maid named Missy Wimplesnatch during a nobles' feast.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a copy of The Butler's Cane Has a Knob on the End could be found in the Lady Jannath 's manse in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate .</p>
