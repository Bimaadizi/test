<p>Fancy was a retired circus horse living in Marigold's Menagerie in the mid-14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to being brought to Marigold's Menagerie, Fancy was an animal performer at the Mooney & Sons Circus .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Fancy shared her stable with another retired circus mare, Gypsy . Both of them preferred to graze in the exercise yard, rather than eating the straw that was provided to them. Both were trained to do tricks, but Marigold Mufflefoot seldom allowed them to perform when exercising due to their old legs being so brittle.</p>
