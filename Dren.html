<p>Dren was one of the Blades of the Old Man in the fortress of Sentinelspire . He was a part of the team accompanying Sauk to look for Kheil and secure the Erael'len in the Northern Shalhoond in Tarsakh of 1374Â DR , conspiring to kill the Old Man of the Mountain . Kerlis , Valmir and Dren stayed behind to watch Berun and Lewan when Sauk decided to hunt down some yaqubi , expecting them to be carrying gold. Berun disabled them and fled, though Sauk's party caught up to them by the next morning.</p>
