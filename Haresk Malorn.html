<p>Haresk Malorn was the High Councilor and Mistran of the council that ruled over Mistledale , the Dalelands , between 1367 and 1372 DR . He also commanded the Riders of Mistledale , Mistledale's mounted defenders. Despite this, Haresk was known as more of a wise and compassionate merchant rather than a true warrior. Despite this, Haresk was well liked by the people of Mistledale.</p>
<p>The high councilor would carry a black " rod of office ", and there was speculation that Haresk's rod of office was in actuality a rod of rulership . He would very appear at the head of his troops, but if he was required to do so, he would use as much magical armor and protective magic as possible.</p>
<p>The House of the High Councilor was Haresk Malorn's residence and it was the largest building in Ashabenford . It was also used by the Council of Six as a nearly official seat of government.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As there were more attacks from the drow as of 1372 DR, Haresk felt that he might have to step down for someone with more military experience.</p>
