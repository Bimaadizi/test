<p>Krieger was a deep gnome councilor of the city of Blingdenstone in 1370 DR . Before becoming a councilor, he was a burrow warden.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Krieger was a very independent individual, even for a former burrow warden and indulged in unorthodox strategies. His former work made Krieger very conscious of all the dangers of the Underdark and his skills were very useful for his later position as councilor, especially because of the threat of vengeance by the Menzoberranzan drow after their war against Mithral Hall .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In his position of Burrow Warden of Blingdenstone, while on patrol he encountered the bodies of "a score" of goblins around the time of the arrival of Drizzt Do'Urden , unbeknownst to him the work of the reanimated Zaknafein Do'Urden controlled by Malice Do'Urden , who watched them hidden. Krieger reported his discoveries to King Schnicktick and the Council. He rose to Councilor for the city after the war with the drow of Menzoberranzan.</p>
