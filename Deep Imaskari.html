<p>Deep Imaskari were a race of humans who were heirs to the lost empire of Imaskar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Few survived the fall of their great empire when their Mulan slaves, having been abducted from other worlds, and magical monsters, created by Imaskari war wizards, turned against them. Their great empire fell leaving only ruins of their ancient cities. Those few that survived fled deep beneath the surface of Faerûn , shutting themselves off and hiding from their many enemies on the surface world.</p>
<p>Living thousands of years in voluntary exile and under influence of strong magics practiced by their own wizards, the Imaskari turned into a human subrace adapted to life underground. Whilst barriers once held the Imaskari hidden from the outside world, and vice versa the outside world from the Imaskari, these barriers were later breached. By 1372 DR , Imaskari were starting to wander into the wider world, exploring the surroundings of their underground home.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Deep Imaskari were guarded and detached, keeping an unconscious watchful eye in all their interactions. Even before fleeing into the deep bowels of the earth, they were fascinated by magics. During their long isolation, they focused on magical experimentation, never shunning risky outcomes or dangerous spell preparations. Regarding their fondness and curiosity for everything magical, the surest way to gain a Deep Imaskari's friendship was by gifting them with magic , either an ancient spell scroll or mysterious artifact .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deep Imaskari were humans with pale, smooth skin that was soft despite its stone-like appearance (this unusual characteristic was a remnant of the magical alteration that all the Imaskari underwent to survive in Deep Imaskar). Deep Imaskari were tall and thin, with males typically standing close to 5.75​ to ​6 feet (1.75​ to ​1.8 meters) in height and weighing around 160 pounds (73 kilograms). Females are usually about 5.25​ to ​5.5 feet (1.6​ to ​1.7 meters) tall and 120 pounds (54 kilograms) in weight.</p>
<p>Deep Imaskari preferred to be well-dressed, with elaborate greatcoats covering simple, but elegant clothing in dark shades. They delighted in dark rings as well, particularly magical ones.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>Preserving their secret realm from the outside world, Deep Imaskari were used to avoiding contact with other races. The Deep Imaskari encountered while exploring outside Deep Imaskar were more excited about meeting other races, although they eyed humans from Unther or Mulhorand suspiciously.</p>
<h2>Religion</h2>
<p>In ancient times, Imaskari wizards traditionally didn't allow their people to worship any deity , for no deity was worthy of the worship of the arrogant Imaskari. Later, in Deep Imaskar, religion was more common although the Imaskari kept themselves to the older Faerûnian pantheon by venerating Kossuth , Chauntea , Shar , Mystra , and Grumbar . Still, few Imaskari chose the path of the cleric and few temples existed in their realm.</p>
<h2>Language</h2>
<p>Deep Imaskari spoke an ancient tongue known as Roushoum , which used the Imaskari script. This ancient language was spoken nowhere outside Deep Imaskari and few outsiders mastered it. Deep Imaskari studied Common so as to interact with other races more easily. The more adventurous Deep Imaskari venturing outside their own realm usually picked two or three Underdark languages, including the Drow language , Undercommon , and Terran .</p>
