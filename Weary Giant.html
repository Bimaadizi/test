<p>The Weary Giant was an inn, tavern, and orphanage in Stagwick , Hartsvale , known for being the home of the adventurers Tavis Burdun and Avner of Hartwick .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The inn was large enough inside for even a fire giant to dance upon its stage, and in fact, such performances were often held there, as it was the only lodge in the entire village. It also had a stable.</p>
<p>The inn served elderberry tarts , a delicious dessert.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The inn was once owned by a woman named Isa Wirr , who raised Tavis and other orphans whom she allowed to live there. When Isa died, she passed the inn on to Tavis, and he became its proprietor.</p>
<p>In 1366 DR , after a performance in which both Princess Brianna and Lord Mayor Ruther Dobbin were in attendance, the book thief Basil hid in the stable, but he was hidden by the orphan Avner.</p>
<p>Also, that same night, Brianna was abducted by ogres on her way home from the inn to Castle Hartwick along Coggin's Rise .</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century, ownership of the inn had been taken over by Tavis's son Wum Burdun .</p>
