<p>Molostroi's entire existence was dedicated to protecting the secrets and power of the fallen elven city. He was not aggressive, carried no weapon, and had a cunning mind.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Molostroi was an ancient and powerful baelnorn with the extent of his power unrevealed. He often presented himself in the baelnorn teleprojection form that was powerful enough to take on dangers and kept his actual body safe.</p>
<p>In the baelnorn teleprojection form, Molostroi had full access to his spells , baelnorn abilities, and some special traits. Molostroi was able to use his magic to turn undead at the level of a powerful cleric , he was immune to cold , electricity , polymorph , and any magics or abilities that affected one's mind. He was able to fly, like other elves, possessed darkvision , and had a wide variety of spells handy, such as sunburst , Power word, stun , prismatic spray , analyze dweomer , Bigby's forceful hand , dimensional anchor , invisibility sphere , and greater dispelling , among many others.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR , the Cult of the Dragon occupied the ruins of Myth Drannor, aiming to corrupt the city's mythal and perform a dreaded ritual submerging the Cult's dracolich ally into the pool of radiance , discovered in the Elven Catacombs under Castle Cormanthor .</p>
<p>Eventually, Molostroi was captured and imprisoned by the cultists, yet he, and his fellow baelnorn protectors, were still able to reach out to the three groups of adventurers that were opposing the cult in the ruins of Myth Drannor. One of these groups was led by Athan and sent by Elminster himself to stop the cult, the second was the group of heroes from Phlan who were tasked with guarding the resurgent pool of radiance under the city but were swept through a gate to Myth Drannor, and the third group of heroes arrived at the city in pursuit of the cult's slavers.</p>
<p>Molostroi used his baelnorn teleprojection to appear in front of the surviving heroes guiding them to stop the cult. Once the adventurers that were in the pursuit of the slavers penetrated the Crypt of Orbakh and laid their hands on the ancient necromancer weapon that rested there, Orbakh's ivory scepter , Molostroi realized that the heroes now had a chance of stopping the cult if he directed them. The scepter was one of few weapons in the ruins of Myth Drannor that was able to destroy Pelendralaar's phylactery , making the cult's plan vulnerable.</p>
<p>He helped them by indicating the most secure way to get to the main hideout of the Cult inside the ruined city and asked them to destroy that phylactery . Once the dracolich was vulnerable, he guided the other surviving group of adventurers to battle the dreaded creature, killing it permanently, and subsequently, restoring the mythal and letting the pool of radiance drain into nothingness.</p>
