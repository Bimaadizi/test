<p>Cairak Redbeard was a pirate of the Nelanther Isles in the midâ€“14th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>Cairak was the lover of Alabhansree Alanasker , the former Chansreena (princess) of the city-state of Ormpur .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Alabhansree and Cairak fled the city of Ormpur, together with many magical blades that had been kept hidden in secret storage niches in the palace, and a large amount of saffron , comprising Ormpur's entire reserve, as well as other spices , a fortune intended as her dowry. They sailed to the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<p>Cairak was easily able to sell off the stolen saffron at ports along the Sword Coast ports, slowly but gaining maximum profit. In the Moonshaes, Alabhansree used her magic and riches to construct a well-defended tower stronghold at Eiresse and set herself up as a wizard .</p>
<p>By 1372 DR, Alabhansree and Cairak still dwelled in Eiresse in the Moonshaes.</p>
<h2>Home</h2>
<p>Alabhansree and Cairak made their home in a small tower in the cozy pirate cove of Eiresse , on the island of Gwynneth in the Moonshaes. The tower was a stronghold, well defended by magical guardians and traps, such as "teeter-totter" floors than dumped trespassers into winding natural sinkholes that led to the sea, where giant octopuses laired.</p>
