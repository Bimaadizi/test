<p>Araundras Othaun was a Chosen of Mystryl in ancient Netheril .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the time of Netheril, Araundras was a Chosen of Mystryl. However, Larloch , a fellow Chosen, doubted Araundras's loyalty to the goddess, so he gave him a ring with a scrying spell inside. Some time later, Telamont Tanthul killed Araundras and took his ring as a trophy. Thus, after Thultanthar returned to Toril in 1372 , Larloch was able to use the ring to spy upon the shadovar 's plans. In 1487 DR , Larloch told Elminster Aumar all about Araundras.</p>
