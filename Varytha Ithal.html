<p>Varytha married into the Suldusk tribe of elves when she joined with Prince Quynn Goldengrove .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the year −190 DR , as a teen-aged girl, Varytha mysteriously vanished, and neither rangers nor mages could track her whereabouts. Unbeknownst to her parents, she had fled human life to live among her mother's people to learn their ways.</p>
<p>In −173 DR , in late spring, Varytha suddenly appeared again to Clan Ithal, and she brought with her grave warnings of rising goblin populations. Her warning and her efforts to reconcile the tense relations between the two sides of her family led to victory against the goblins, and she even served as an advance scout throughout this time. Her later marriage to a prince of the Suldusk elves further tightened ties between the two races of men and elves.</p>
