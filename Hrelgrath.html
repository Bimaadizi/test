<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hrelgrath was one of the dreadspells sent with Elryn to find and slay a Chosen of Mystra near Westgate two tendays into the Chaos of the Art in the 797 DR . During the first leg of the trip, he had Uldus Blackram lead the way, while holding a knife to the man's back. During the first leg of their trip, Uldus Blackram was killed by Ilbryn Starym , an elven wizard they chanced upon.</p>
<p>Once they found the ruin, Karsus' Keep, Hrelgrath helped loot it of valuables. The team of dreadspells then sought to bring down the whole ruin on top of two people they spotted, a self-styled god Azuth and the Chosen of Mystra they sought, by using all their looted magic to hurl destructive spells at them. Once their looted magic failed against Azuth, despite bringing down the ruin, they fled.</p>
<p>When Dread Sister Klalaera appeared and herded them back against Azuth, they were stopped partway by Umbregard and Starsunder , two mages that appeared suddenly. During the battle, one of Starsunder's spells destroyed him and Vaelam at the same time it blocked their spells.</p>
