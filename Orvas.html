<h2>History</h2>
<p>Orvas was one of sixteen formulas for poisons recorded in the book known as The Nathlum . It was thought that the formulas were originally written down by the mage Lethchauntos the Black , during his time spent with an orc tribe in the 10 th century DR . Some of these same formulas were copied from the book by the mage Phrandjas of Port Llast and sold to local alchemists before the midâ€“14 th century DR.</p>
