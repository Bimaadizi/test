<p>A war fan was a hand fan adapted for use as a weapon. Some monks were specially trained in its use.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A war fan appeared at first like the fans often used by ladies to cool themselves. Most were beautifully decorated. Upon closer look, however, it was revealed that the vanes of the van were made of steel, and the tips ended in sharp points that were used for slashing at foes. Because it appeared as an innocuous item, one could sometimes trick foes into not realizing the danger of the weapon until it was too late.</p>
