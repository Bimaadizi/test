<h2>History</h2>
<p>Founded in 315 NY (−3544 DR) , Frostypaw was the main port city of the Rengarth barbarians . Situated far from other settlements on the cold plains, it could only be reached via ship, sled dog , or magical transportation until Netherese magical alterations in the Silver Age ( −2758 DR to −2208 DR ) made the harsh weather more amenable.</p>
<p>As the Netherese took to the sky in their enclaves during the Golden Age ( −2207 DR to −1206 DR ), the Rengarth's distrust of magic led to them focusing more on trade with the dwarves of Ascore , and reacted to the approach of flying cities with arrows and javelins . Despite the hostility, the Age of Discovery ( −1205 DR to −697 DR ) saw an influx of trade with Netheril when pearls and other valuable goods were found in the water a few miles off shore. While the flying enclaves were still driven away, those Netherese who didn't flaunt their magic were allowed in. When Vandal Station was depopulated by plague in 2328 NY (−1531 DR) , most of the survivors moved to take shelter in Frostypaw.</p>
<p>The barbarians suffered a schism in 2477 NY (−1382 DR) when the local Angardts befriended a Netherese arcanist and began learning arcane magic. While the Angardts were happy to learn magic that could be used against marauding orcs and goblins , their cousins could not countenance the idea and violently expelled the Angardts from their lands over the next seven years.</p>
<p>Towards the end of Netheril, the phaerimm 's magical attacks led to the weather around Frostypaw returning to its naturally inhospitable state, and most of the Netherese left for warmer climes. Near the time of Karsus's Folly , as the High Ice expanded south and the Narrow Sea dried up, the Rengarth abandoned Frostypaw completely as they migrated west into the Savage North .</p>
