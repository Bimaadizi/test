<p>The Worried Wyvern was an average-quality inn located in the town of Hill's Edge in the Sunset Vale .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>

<p>The Worried Wyvern was perhaps best known for its food. Morning and Highsun meals often included bacon , sausage , and toasted bread with drippings, as well as a signature omelet of asparagus and spiced fish . Evening meals featured roasted meats and dishes like chicken liver with mushroom sauce or green peppers stuffed with rice , tomato , and ground meat.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The inn was fairly new as of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , at which time it was regarded by Volo as the most average inn in town. It was known as a clean, safe, pleasant, and overall unexciting place to stay. The otherwise very good experience of eating in the dining room was marred by a particularly bad harpist .</p>
