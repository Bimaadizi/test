<p>Adama's Tooth was a monolith found close to the gap between the Dustwall and Giant's Belt mountains. In the late 14 th century DR , it was the only known source of plangent crystal .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Adama's Tooth was an immense monolith with cleft, striated sides, which were nearly vertical. It was over 2,000 feet (610 meters) in height. The Tooth was clearly visible over the nearby foothills along the path from Huorm.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>In 1374 DR , the monolith lay a few miles from the Golden Water , near Huorm . By 1479 DR , the monolith lay on the tip of a peninsula of the same name.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>A road spiraled up around the sides of the monolith. Along that road, there was a gate and a small cave for guards. Eventually, even those defenses had proven insufficient, and instead, an airship dock had been built between canyons on the top of the monolith; all meals and services were provided internally.</p>
<p>Before the mine was closed, there were five levels inside it; the fifth level could only be accessed from above. It contained a number of ruins from an Imaskari complex, an incredible amount of plangent crystal incrustations all throughout, and a gate leading into the Celestial Nadir.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some of the less civilized tribes of the Durpari considered the monolith a holy site, known to them as the Dragon Lodge .</p>
<p>To Warian Datharathi 's knowledge, the crystal for his prosthetic arm , installed in 1367 DR , had come from the Fourth Deep of the Datharathi mine in Adama's Tooth. Between that year and 1372 DR , another level had been excavated into the mines within the monolith, reaching a natural chamber lined in plangent crystal ; alongside this chamber, a portal into the Celestial Nadir had been found. Shaddon Datharathi used this crystal in order to build his upgraded plangent limbs; he also unleashed Pandorym in the process.</p>
<p>By 1479 DR , the monolith lay on a peninsula.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>By 1479 DR , an evil of elder days was said to lie in wait there, with a cloud of darkness atop the spire like a flag, waiting to cause more death, like it had unleashed before on the senior members of the Datharathi in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
