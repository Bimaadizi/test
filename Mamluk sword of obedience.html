<p>The Mamluk swords of obedience were magical swords that could be found in Zakhara , the Land of Fate .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These swords were available in a wide variety of sword types.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These weapons enhanced a wielder's fighting skill, but their main power was over all human, demihuman , and humanoid creatures. When struck by the sword, these creatures were charmed unless they were able to resist. Charmed creatures immediately surrendered to the wielder and behaved as if under a charm person or charm monster spell.</p>
<p>The wielder did not have to be a mamluk to use the sword's power.</p>
