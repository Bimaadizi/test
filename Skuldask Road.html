<p>Skuldask Road was a moderately traveled trade road in the Western Heartlands of Faer√ªn . It branched off of Thundar's Ride near the center of the Fields of the Dead and stretched east-southeast to Elturel . Below Elturel it crossed the River Chionthar and continued southeast until it met the Uldoon Trail just below Berdusk .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>As of the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , there was a little-known village of gnomes and dwarves among the ruins at the intersection of Skuldask Road and Thundar's Ride called Tempus's Tears . Travel along the road was relatively safe because patrols of Hellriders from Elturel traveled this road every four hours or so, even at night. South of Elturel, the patrols ended at Windstream Lodge (one of their outposts).</p>
<p>As of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the "leaf farm" owned by Tatha Beruel , called Aloum Lyndren , was located just north of Skuldask Road a few miles west of Elturel.</p>
