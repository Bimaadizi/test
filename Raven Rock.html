<p>Raven Rock was the ancestral mound of the Black Raven and Gray Wolf tribes of Uthgardt people.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Raven Rock was located near the headwaters of Black Raven River in the Spine of the World .</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>The site was so named for the 100-foot-tall (30.5 meter) stone sculpture of a perched raven that stood atop the snow-covered plateaus that composed the tribe's burial mound. Just south of the stone was a wolf -shaped depression that surrounded an alter engraved with the phases of the moon .</p>
<p>A number of stone menhirs dotted Raven Rock's plateaus.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Along the burial cairns found within, the ancestral mound held the spoils of war that were amassed by Black Raven raiders. Two relics were included among the wealth of riches, each of which was highly valued by their respective tribe. A giant -sized ring of hardened magma was buried near the stone raven, while an enchanted red-dragon -femur was found near the Gray Wolf relic.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Members of the Gray Wolf tribe were forbidden from the mound's highest plateau. They gathered near their altar to the south. The Black Ravens were rumored to have a consistent honor guard of no less than ten barbarians and ten giant ravens guarding the Raven Rock at all times.</p>
