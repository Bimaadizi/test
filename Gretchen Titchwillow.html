They took her under their boughs, telling her stories and teaching her many willow-secrets over the course of a full year. At year's end she was given a huge gem that allowed her to commune with the willows always, and was sent off to wander under the wise guidance of the trees. Eventually she was tasked with traveling to the city of Baldur's Gate to put down an evil presence and plant a willow tree.</p>
