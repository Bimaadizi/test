<p>Some time in late 1359 DR , or 1360 DR , a group of Harpers held a meeting at the inn to discuss what should be done about the growing Zhentarim threat in Anauroch . In the end, it was decided that the inexperienced member of the group Lander would travel out to the great desert and uncover information about the Zhents' activities.</p>

<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
