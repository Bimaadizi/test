<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Klaus and the Principal Sniffer ghoul Benji could be found at the gate of Lucretious's circus in Rivington of Baldur's Gate , where the extra-planar troupe performed for a short period of time, before moving on to another world. In lieu of recently surging murders in the Gate, Benji was tasked with sniffing out blood on every guest entering the circus. The ghoul was supervised by Klaus, the Assistant Sniffer, who allowed patrons through the locked gates. One of the sniffees was the commoner man named Montgomery , who brought his son to see the famed Dribbles the clown. Even though the father and the son both were clean, the boy was terrified of the blood-covered jester ghoul and refused to enter the circus.</p>
