<p>A bag of transmuting was a type of enchanted bag, similar in appearance to a bag of holding , that changed materials from valuable into near worthlessness.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When first encountered a bag of transmuting would seem as if it was a normal bag of holding , this including its ability to store items in a nondimensional space and retrieve said items again. However after a few uses over a couple of days the magical field starts to waver, and while the items themselves remain they change their type; gems and valuable metals become common iron and rocks, while enchanted items lose their enchantments and become ordinary nonmagical versions. Only artifacts and relics were strong enough to resist the transmuting effect.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1359 DR in the palace of Juiblex , in the realm of Shedaklah , there lay amongst many true treasures fair and foul, a Bag of Transmuting just waiting for some unlucky adventourer to snatch it thinking it was a genuine bag of holding .</p>
<p>Around 1367 DR deep in the Mere of Dead Men , in Castle Naerytar , a Bag of Transmuting lay alongside more wholesome treasures in the castles treasure room.</p>
