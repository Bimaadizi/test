<p>Ansel Burwyth , also called the Master of Gems , was a skilled wizard who lived during the 4 th century DR in Mulhorand or one of the nearby regions.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ansel was hired in 326 DR , along with many other mages, by the ruling bodies of Tashalar to rid them of Magister Onsilur Maerdrathom who had become quite a nuisance to their way of life. Ansel succeeded where others who came before him failed. He was able to trap the soul of Onsilur within a tel'kiira . Lured by the riches left for the taking in Onsilur's tower , Ansel hid the kiira and entered the tower, only to be killed by the wide array of magical traps Onsilur had in place.</p>
