<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Joreld was among the many War Wizards that responded in the wake of the disaster during the Council of the Dragon . He commented about the deaths of many nobles during the event while heading towards Glathra Barcantle to make their report, together with Welwyn Tracegar . They were so engrossed in their converse that they missed Amarune Whitewave running loose in the castle, and almost missed Mirt doing the same thing; they dismissed him instead as probably unimportant.</p>
<p>Later, he was called upon by Glathra to capture Amarune and Storm Silverhand , who wanted to talk to King Foril Obarskyr I about the blueflame ghosts sighted during the Council. Her order was cut short, and she neglected to call it again.</p>

<p>He considered the deaths of Montror Barelder and Lyrannus Tantorn to be nothing worth fighting over.</p>
