<p>Land lampreys were a species of lamprey that had mutated to be capable of surviving on land.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Their bodies were fairly thick and heavy compared to ocean lampreys, with light to blackish green bodies measuring 3 feet (0.91 meters) in length.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Unlike sea lamprey, they could be compelled to let go of prey by exposing them to fire .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<h3>Biology</h3>
<p>Land lampreys could breathe air and moved similarly to a snake .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Much like a leech and the more common sea lamprey, land lampreys used their mouths to fasten themselves to prey, from which they gradually drained blood. Once full, they detached themselves from their prey, but otherwise they largely refused to let go unless killed.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , land lampreys were one of many creatures driven out of the Rat Hills by the Rat Hills Conflagration and into nearby Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
