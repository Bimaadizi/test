<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The old seaman had a fleecy white and shaggy beard and eyebrows that covered his red and scarred face. He often carried around a battered tobacco pipe.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Jheldarr was stern and weathered. He was not above murder and committing crimes if they were beneficial to the guild's success. He and his guild had a bad reputation among other businessmen of Waterdeep.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , , "Stormrunner" attended the wedding of the Open Lord of Waterdeep Piergeiron the Paladinson and Eidola of Neverwinter . The wedding was to take away from Master Mariners' Guild 's business via a trade agreement between Waterdeep the Boareskyr family. The Mariners led by Jheldarr plotted to disrupt the event; the guild members set a crossbow trap to fire at the husband and wife during the ceremony. The plan was foiled by a young noble Kastonoph Nesher , one of the Mariners named Terrance Decamber was killed, and one female conspirator was apprehended, but "Stormrunner" himself avoided personal involvement.</p>
