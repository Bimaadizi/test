<p>Gorra , who was also known as Withers , was an undead wight that acted as an overseer in the Tomb of the Nine Gods .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When he was alive, Withers was an Omuan engineer named Gorra, but when Acererak enslaved the city, he was put to work constructing the tomb and its various traps .</p>
<p>When the tomb was complete, Gorra's traps proved to have worked the best, and Acererak rewarded him by transforming him into a wight, and letting him oversee the tomb.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Withers kept a manual of clay golems and owned a spellbook as befitted a wizard.</p>
<p>He also kept a control gem for a gray slaad that was kept in the tomb, and had a skeletal songbird in a cage in his office, presumably as a pet.</p>
