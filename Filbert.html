<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Great and Magnificent and Also Irresistibly Handsome Filbert hame home in a garden of luminescent and brightly-colored giant mushrooms in the roots of a massive tree at the heart of the Resurrection Gorge some years before the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR . Unaware or uninterested in the Vernus 's circle in a hollow of the tree, Fil carried one of the magic stones that served as a lock that sealed an ancient great evil and could summon a glabrezu . The faerie dragon was willing to exchange his rock for some pretty glowing crystals â€“ aphrodisiacs to woo local female faerie dragons. The crystals grew to the northeast from the great tree. However, the dragon failed to disclose that a nest of ankhegs was just underneath the crystal garden.</p>
