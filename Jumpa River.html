<p>The Jumpa River , or Jumpa Muren , was one of the largest rivers in all of Toril .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Located in the Hordelands and northeast Faerûn , the Jumpa River originated within Katakoro Shan in Khazari , flowing past A-Ling Shan , where it joined the Gaya at the Great Pass within the southern region of the majestic Yehimal mountains.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Over time the large quantity of water flowing down the Jumpa River eroded the great channel known as the Jumpa River Gorge . This impressive feature lined the entire western edge of the mountain ranges along the river, forming the western borders of several nations, including Khazari and Ra-Khati . The average depth of the gorge was 1,000 ft (300 m).</p>
<p>Yearly glacial run-off filled the Jumpa River with frigid water that was capable of carrying away nearly anything in its path.</p>
<p>The only known crossing point of the Jumpa River and the gorge was the Great Chain Bridge of Ra-Khati .</p>
<p>Due to its connection to the Gaya River, as well as its impressive natural features, the river was considered to be one of the Thousand Sacred Sources of the Gaya , and many would follow the river to its source as part of their pilgrimages.</p>
