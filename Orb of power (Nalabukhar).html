<p>The orbs of power of the Nalabukharn were fabled devices of great magical power, which Magister Phelandern Ghemelt sought during his time in office, during the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Per the legends that Phelandern Ghemelt read at some point prior to 1318 DR , these crystal orbs were once in possession of the Calishite Nalabukharn family. There were supposed to be six of them, hidden throughout Faerûn, and others beyond the Nalabukharn might possess the secrets of their operation.</p>
<p>They not only held powers, but could even learn more powers, and operate as dictated by their owner. Whoever owned them could teleport themselves to their position through a command phrase; the orbs also had the power to drain both life and magic, whether spell or magical abilities, through an extruded crystalline tentacle, on command. These drained powers could then be granted to the wielder.</p>
<p>Legend also held that Alair Nalabukhar yet lived inside one of those orbs, where he retreated when his body became too mangled.</p>
