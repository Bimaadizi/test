<p>Lake Mulsantir was a lake that made up the border of Thesk , Rashemen , and Thay .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Lake Mulsantir was connected to Lake Ashane via the wide River Mulsantir ; together the two lakes made up the western and southern borders of Rashemen. Lake Mulsantir was surrounded by Rashemen to the north and Thay to the south. The lakes were located in deep rifts between the high plateaus of Ashanath , Thay, and the North Country . East of Lake Mulsantir was the Gorge of Gauros , through which the River Gauros flowed.</p>
<p>Three rivers drained into the lake from the south: River Sur , River Thay , and River Gauros. The waters of the lake itself moved north through the River Mulsantir to Lake Ashane.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lake Mulsantir was a freshwater lake. Its waters were dangerously turbulent and murky, but housed great numbers of fish, since it was warmer than the neighboring waters of Lake Ashane.</p>
<p>The lake was inhabited by crossbreeds created by the Red Wizards of Thay , but these monsters tended to stick to the southern shores. Rashemi witchboats piloted by hathrans patrolled the lake.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thay used to attempt to invade Rashemen by controlling and crossing the lake, even creating monstrous crossbreeds in an attempt to inconvenience the Rashemen, but they gave up after failing too many times. However, in 1370 DR , Thay once again attempted to sail the Lake Mulsantir in an invasion attempt but were turned back my magical storms created by hathrans.</p>
<p>In 1372 DR , the Red Wizards captured a dragon turtle in Lake Thaylambar and planned to set it loose under their control into the lake.</p>
