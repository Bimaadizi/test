<p>Koront was one of the three war-leaders of the Tornskulls , a tribe of nearly 5,000 orcs whose territory encompassed the Dead Orc Pass in the Rauvin Mountains during the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Immense in size, even for an orc, Koront had gray, heavily-scarred skin and a bald head.</p>
<p>Koront was renowned among the tribe for his endurance in battle.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>War-leader Koront, along with Naurorin and Baerzel , took over as leaders of the Tornskulls after a cave-in killed the tribe's chieftain Glorlarkh in the early 1370's.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Koront had an intense rivalry with his fellow War-leader Naurorin, which was well-reciprocated. Baerzel kept the two in check, reminding them that in-fighting would weaken the tribe and stop their greater goal of becoming a greater power in the region.</p>
<p>One of Koront's remarkable commanders was Vaug the strong , whose claw of 80 orcs was stationed at the Dead Orc Pass.</p>
