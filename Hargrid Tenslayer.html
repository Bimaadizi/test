<p>Hargrid Tenslayer was the Tharchion of Laprendar in Thay around 1357 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Not Thayan himself, Hargrid was originally from Thesk but after killing the child of a hierarch of Phsant , he was driven out of the city. He went to Thay, which suited his nature better.</p>
<p>When Thay's attempt to invade Rashemen ended in catastrophe, Hargrid actually managed to distinguish himself and he was promoted to autharch of Falls .</p>
<p>After Laprendar's last tharchion died in mysterious circumstances (that is, poison ), Hargrid made his successor by unanimous agreement.</p>
<p>Around 1357 DR, he was heavily involved in the Salamander War , having made alliance with Aznar Thrul , Zulkir of Evocation, and Sabass , Zulkir of Conjuration, the mages responsible for causing it.</p>
