<p>Marrok was a Master Blacksmith who worked enchantments for Durga , the proprietor of the Shining Knight Arms & Armor shop located in the City Core of Neverwinter in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Marrok was a powerful and stout dwarf . He had a dark brown skin, weathered with age and years of hard work, and beard and hair, whitened by age. He cared little for fey faff and openly showed disdain for magical components such as fairy dust .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Durga tried his best to keep the business afloat with the supplies drying out and the city being ravaged by a plague â€“ the Wailing Death . When Durga met customers who looked like they knew value of enchanted stock, he ensorcelled a wardstone that allowed them entrance to the shop's backrooms, where Marrok ran his forge. The dwarf knew secrets of strengthening enchanted items and improved magics weaved into weapons and armor with the ingredients provided to him. This service was only available to Durga's special customers.</p>
