<p>Darkdew was a perfume historically associated with femmes fatales across the Realms by the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Darkdew was an opaque, black, oily ointment that that was widely believed to had come from the Underdark and be a distillation of monster blood and sweat of licentious female drow elves . However, this was nothing but a salacious rumor. In reality, darkdew was a mix of three different plant oils, six kinds of herbs , and a distillate of slugs .</p>
<p>When applied to the skin, Darkdew turned clear and lasted for about a day. It had a musky smell, pleasant and arousing to most species, from fey to goblinoids . Its stimulating effects sometimes were much, much stronger for some humans , elves and half-elves . This made darkdew a common purchase for their personal bedroom use.</p>
<p>To taste, the substance was similar to dark and bitter licorice .</p>
