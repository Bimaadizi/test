<p>Dahla River was a short river in central Netheril that descended from the Shinantra Mountains .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The river was quite slow and gentle, possessing few monsters and little in the way of fish to catch. It was mainly a source of fresh water for travelers over anything else.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The river flowed down from the Shinantra Mountains down to Hidden Lake , passing under Whitewater Bridge and beyond Dahla River City .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The normally placid and unremarkable river suddenly flooded during 3456 NY (−403 DR) and almost destroyed Dahla River City, leading to the construction of the unnecessarily large and over-engineered Whitewater Bridge in 3465 NY (−394 DR) .</p>
