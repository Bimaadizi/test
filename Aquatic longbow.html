<p>Aquatic longbows were an underwater version of the longbow used by aquatic elves .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The aquatic longbow could be used normally above water, achieving effective ranges similar to surface shortbows . When used with sea arrows underwater, the aquatic longbow did not suffer from a loss of accuracy and power over short distances, allowing the user to perform long-range shots. These bows used a special kelp bowstring that dampened the turbulence of launching. Mighty composite versions of the aquatic longbow ranged from 600 gp to 900 gp.</p>
