<p>The Seldarine ( Elvish for "fellowship of brothers and sisters of the wood") was the elven pantheon of gods that resided on the astral dominion of Arvandor under the leadership of Corellon Larethian .</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The many members of the Seldarine included:</p>
<h2>Worship</h2>
<p>Each member of the Seldarine was represented by both male and female forms. For example, in Cormanthor, there were statues of the Seldarine in either both their male and female forms or in a single androgynous form. Some gods even had more than three forms, including nonhumanoid forms.</p>
<p>In fact, the elves found the human obsession with biological sex and gender roles to be limiting and not befitting of a deity, who was beyond mortal definitions. All gods were to be respected, not squeezed into a role that presented them as little more than powerful versions of mortals at best or spoiled children at worst.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Myths & Lore</h3>
<p>Among their accomplishments as an organisation, the Seldarine are reputed to have driven the Ordning from their realm before settling there, only allowing Iallanis to remain because she did not fight back. Because of this, they did not hold much respect for her.</p>
<h3>War of the Seldarine</h3>
<p>In −30,000 DR , Araushnee, with the help of her son Vhaeraun , gathered a host of evil deities opposed to the Seldarine, and convinced them to attack Arvandor , in an attempt to overthrow Corellon . Ghaunadaur entered the fray on his own without being asked by anyone.</p>
<p>She had planned for the assault to ultimately fail, as her actual goal was for his consort to be killed during the battle and to replace him as Coronal of Arvandor. She tricked Eilistraee into dangerously injuring her own father, but the Weaver's conspiracy was ultimately thwarted by Sehanine Moonbow , and Corellon's life was saved. Angharradh arose from the great battle between the Seldarine and the followers of Araushnee . Aerdrie, Hanali and Sehanine came together to heal Corellon Larethian after he was felled by Eilistraee who was fooled by Araushnee. As they did so, they formed Angharradh, serving alongside Corellon as the Queen of Arvandor. . After her betrayal was revealed, Araushnee was banished by Corellon and turned into a tanar'ri , while Vhaeraun was simply exiled. Even though she was cleared from all guilt, Eilistraee chose to share her mother's and brother's punishment, because she knew that the drow would need her light in the times to come.</p>
<p>The wizard Mordenkainen recorded a different version of this story. According to him, all elves, including the ones who would become the deities of the Seldarine and of the Dark Seldarine, emerged from the blood that Corellon lost in a fight against Gruumsh . Like their god, the first elves had shape-changing powers, and freedom with them. The Protector took some favorites, who were made deities : among them, Lolth was the most privileged. She saw that other races made something out of their lives, and made the argument that the elves should do the same by casting off their shape-changing powers in exchange of a fixed form, that would allow them to gain dominion over everything. Every single elf agreed and chose such a form, but Corellon was revolted by their decision and railed against Lolth. The god was stopped with the argument that nobody of his blood should be attacked, and, while he was thinking about it, Lolth used the opportunity to attempt to murder him. Realizing the extent of Lolth's betrayal, many elves intervened to stop her, but some remained loyal to the Spider Queen: the latter became the dark elves and their gods, and Lolth became a demon lord of the Abyss . Eilistraee was an exception in this version too, for she did not side with Lolth, but still chose to follow the dark elves. Araushnee took the name of Lolth, and made the 66th layer of the Abyss, the Demonweb Pits , her new home.</p>
<h3>Modern History</h3>
<p>The events of the Spellplague affected the Seldarine, though perhaps not as harshly as it did some of the other deities. However, several of the gods, such as Deep Sashelas, Labelas, Solonor, Erevan, Fenmarel, and Shevarash all became exarchs. Corellon and Angharradh managed to hang on to their original positions, but Hanali became the elven aspect of Sune, and Sehanine of Selune.</p>
<p>After the Second Sundering, order was restored, and the Seldarine was back to the way it was prior to the Spellplague, with Sehanine being described as Corellon's main consort/beloved.</p>
