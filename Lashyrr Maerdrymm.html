<p>Lashyrr Maerdrymm , more commonly known simply as the White Lady , was an aquatic elf baelnorn and the leader of the Dukar Order of Numos in Myth Nantar in Serôs as of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . She was titled the Grand Savant of the First Order and Paragon of the Numosi Order.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Of all the Dukar paragons, Lashyrr was most public and well known around 1370 DR . Following hundreds of years of isolation in Myth Nantar and Qatoris , she looked forward to rebuilding links with other elves .</p>
<p>High Mage Pharom Ildacer of the Nantarn Council was in secret discussions with Lashyrr to exchange magical knowledge: she would learn a little of elven High Magic and he would learn of Dukar magic and their Coral Hand power.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Lashyrr believed herself to be the last of her family, and so had not used her clan name in more than two centuries. In truth, she was a cousin of Khelben Arunsun , the Blackstaff of Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>On becoming a baelnorn, Lashyrr transformed her body into living pearl , rather than an undead state. She resembled a statue of pale blue and ivory hue, and looked as beautiful as she did in her younger days, despite being some 975 years of age as of 1370 DR .</p>
