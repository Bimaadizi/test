<p>Revived fossils were the remains of animals, or more rarely people that were preserved in a petrified state, and then animated.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Revived fossils were creatures made of petrified bones. While animated, they remained partially encased in stone.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>While mostly identical to simple skeletons , revived fossils enjoyed stony bones that shrugged off all but the strongest blows from weapons not made out of adamantine , and their heft granted them additional staying power in a fight. They required special rituals in order to animate.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Revived fossils could only do as commanded by their masters. The orders could not be too complex, either.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Underdungeon under Stardeep was unexplored, but some of its passages contained a number of fossilized remains that were animated by the relic lich . The same lich also proved capable of reducing living creatures to a fossilized state.</p>
<p>The Keeper of the Cerulean Sign Telarian was attacked by a swarm of them once while he was still an Empyrean Knight exploring the Underdungeon , and Commander Brathtar was the one who saved his life then. Another Keeper, Kiril Duskmourn , was attacked alongside her party by the fossils on 1375 DR . At the same time, Telarian encountered the relic lich responsible for the animation of the revived fossils.</p>
