<p>Garrik Oakspear was an elf thief who served as the chief spy of the archmage Halaster Blackcloak during the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Garrik regularly traveled throughout the city of Waterdeep , at least once per week, and collected information for his master Halaster. He patrolled the various levels of Undermountain, stalked trespassing adventurers, and reported upon their various activities to any of the "Mad Mage's" apprentices. He was granted a personal allowance and was not above taking down lone interlopers to free them of their wealth and possessions.</p>
<p>He frequented establishments in Skullport , but made his home in Wyllowwood . His simple abode was filled with many paper sketches of the same woman.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Garrik was infatuated with the druid Wyllow and felt exceptional joy whenever she paid him the slightest amount of attention. Halaster knew any potential romance was an impossibility, and was amused by his romantic intentions. While Wyllow was aware of his feelings, the two maintained a semblance of friendship.</p>
<h2>Possession</h2>
<p>Among Garrik's possessions were a +2 short sword of quickness , a wand of flame extinguishing , a ring of invisibility , a horned ring , and a brooch of shielding .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time during the 14 th century, Garrik was forced to flee to Undermountain after he earned the enmity of Xanathar , leader of the eponymous Xanathar's Thieves' Guild . While he believed his exceptional skills would keep him safe within the deeper reaches of the dungeon, he was stopped and apprehended by Muiral , one of Halaster's apprentices. Seeking to punish Garrik and make him suffer, Muiral brought the thief before his master Halaster. Rather than kill the intruder, Halaster cast a number of charm spells upon the elf until his natural magical resistance was penetrated and he came under the archmage's sway.</p>
<p>Garrik revealed all he knew about Xanathar's Thieves' Guild to Halaster and quickly became his lead surface scout. He went on to create a room full of malicious traps within a stone building in Wyllowwood, used to test the skills of intruding adventurers. The chamber was filled with hidden swinging blades, spike pits, and false-padlocked chests that were rigged with poison -tipped needles.</p>
