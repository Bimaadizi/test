<p>Liara Portyr ( pronounced : / l i ˈ ɑːr ɑː p ɔːr ˈ t ɪər / lee-AR-ah por-TEER ) was a member of the Portyr patriar family, the commander of Fort Beluarian and the highest-ranking member of the Flaming Fist in Chult in the late 15 th century DR . She answered only to Duke Ulder Ravengard of Baldur's Gate .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Liara was a hard-hearted and dedicated leader who held high respect for militaristic order. She saw hardships as challenges for her to overcome.</p>
<p>She admired those who took up the adventuring life. She supported those who operated within her jurisdictional area of Chult and assisted them with overcoming obstacles they faced.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Liara was born to the well-off Portyr family of Baldur's Gate , niece of Grand Duke Dillard Portyr .</p>
<p>At the age of forty-seven, she was assigned to the post of Fort Beluarian in Chult. During her command, she struck a deal with the pirates of Jahaka Anchorage , ensuring extra wealth for her and her soldiers, along with safe passage for Baldurian vessels. The Zhentarim subsequently heard rumors of this arrangement and sent their agent Rokah to find evidence with which to blackmail her.</p>
<p>Three years into her command in Chult, the death curse afflicted Toril . Liara remained more invested in her mission than in learning about the curse, but she presumed that the ancient witch doctor known as Nanny Pu'pu likely knew something about its origins.</p>
<p>When Grand Duke Ravengard became trapped in Elturgard during the city's descent into Avernus in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Liara Portyr was summoned back to Baldur's Gate to take the lead of the Flaming Fist. When the Cult of Bane and its secret leader Lord Enver Gortash was reaching for political power in the Gate, the cult targeted Liara and her uncle. Gortash planned to remove Dillard from his seat in favor of Liara with simple threats. She, in turn, was to be infected with an illithid tadpole that would enslave Liara to the Absolute . During the Absolute crisis , Liara Portyr held the title of the Commander of the Flaming Fist Headquarters stationed in the Basilisk Gate barracks. During that time, Blaze Portyr dispatched investigators to tackle various crimes in the Gate, including sending investigator Valeria to a "plague ship" (case #612), a "hand-taking murderer" (case #655), the "mortal injury to the waveservant " (case #657). She supervised the investigation into the disappearance of Lora Bergauz 's seven-year-old daughter from the Blushing Mermaid . Liara uncovered a lead, but in the process, she was bewitched by the culprit – the green hag named Auntie Ethel . Liara's mind was clouded and forced her to talk in circles as if completely forgetting anything related to the investigation or the missing child. If Auntie Ethel were to be successfully defeated, Liara would come to her senses, her mind clear, apart from headaches and a vague memory of a fey .</p>
