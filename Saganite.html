<p>Saganite , also known as "needle stone", "love stone", or "hairstone", was a variety of chalcedony that encased many needlelike inclusions.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Saganite was usually a bone white to yellow stone with contrasting brown or greenish-black needles. The needles most often radiated from a central point like a star. Large samples were common and it was often traded as "a fist of saganite" in the marketplaces of Amn . A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This stone, when added to the material component of any spell that produced explosions or bursts of fire, increased the power of the detonation or flame by a small amount.</p>
