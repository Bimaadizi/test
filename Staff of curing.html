<p>Staves of curing were enchanted curative staves said to have been created by Torm , the Loyal Fury.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Some staves of curing were imbued with a +1 enchantment, increased defenses, and allowed their wielders to cast cure serious wounds as well as heal any negative effects such as poison , blindness or deafness , intoxication, etc ., while others only possessed curative magic and enchanted the wielder's skills in healing and medicine.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Even though it was believed that Torm manifested these staves at the times of dire strife, , the deity responsible for these items changed depending on whom one was to ask. Because of that, many believed that the staves of curing were sent by a collective of goodly gods to mortals in need.</p>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR , staves of curing could be found across the Sword Coast and the Moonsea regions.</p>
<h2>Notable Staves of Curing</h2>
<p>Circa 1370 DR , a staff of curing was kept in the kitchen of the House of the Moon temple of Selûne in Waterdeep . The senior priest on duty carried it to heal injuries and to deal with the green slime used for waste disposal if it got out of control.</p>
