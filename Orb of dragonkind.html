<p>An orb of dragonkind was an artifact capable of summoning and controlling evil dragons .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Each orb of dragonkind contained the essence of an ancient dragon, including their personality. While these dragons usually were evil chromatics , there also existed orbs entrapped with the essence of metallic dragons , shadow dragons , and even cloud dragons .</p>
<p>While dormant, an orb of dragonkind was an engraved 10‑inch (0.25‑meter) crystal globe. When activated they grew to about 20 inches (0.51 meters) and displayed colored mists in their interior, an internal fire that matched the color of its associated dragon type. They often had an ancient, forgotten script faintly etched into them. And it was not uncommon for them to be mounted upon three-armed stands made of precious metals.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A creature could try to control an orb of dragonkind by looking at it and speaking its command word . However, the magic on these artifacts had been warped over the centuries, so an orb might also attempt to gain control of its user in order to pursue the goals of the essence trapped inside.</p>
<p>If successful in gaining control over it, the user of an orb of dragonkind was granted access to several spells, such as cure wounds , daylight , death ward , and scrying . The main power of the orb was to telepathically call all evil dragons in a 40‑mile (64‑kilometer) radius to its position, a power that could be used once every hour. Additionally, the wielder of an orb was to be granted immunity to the breath weapon of the dragon variety keyed to it.</p>
<p>All orbs could be used to communicate both verbally and visually with other orbs of dragonkind , usually providing the identity of an owner was known, functioning similarly to a crystal ball .</p>
<p>Although resilient, orbs of dragonkind could be destroyed by sufficiently powerful magic weapons or by a disintegrate spell.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The original five orbs of dragonkind were believed to have been created on the planet Krynn in an effort to master dragons in the great Dragon Wars . They were said to employ the same fundamental magic as the orbs of draconic influence crafted by the dragons of Toril . It was unknown exactly how many of these orbs existed, with various stories featuring different amounts and some tales even telling of ones being destroyed. Some sources claimed there was one for every age category for each of the core dragon varieties.</p>
<p>One of the orbs of dragonkind , or at least an enchanted item of similar renown was hidden away in the Tomb of Damara sometime before 14 th century DR . This artifact allowed its owner to transform into a powerful red dragon , but it was destroyed by Netheril , a wizard from Freedale in the mid-14 th century DR.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, only three orbs of dragonkind were believed to still exist. It was rumored that they were sought after by the Cult of the Dragon .</p>
<p>The frost giant Gryttmort took possession of an orb of dragonkind sometime in the late 15 th century DR in an attempt to become a jarl and ascend in the shattered ordning . After his plans were thwarted by Minsc , Boo , Delina , Krydle , Shandie , Nerys , and Saarvin , the orb was given to the custody of the white dragon Nilanthe .</p>
