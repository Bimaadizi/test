<p>The staff of Konash was a unique and legendary enchanted staff rumored to be cursed and attributed to some unknown ancient evil deity .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Due to the item's enchantments, the staff of Konash could only be wielded by clerics , wizards , or sorcerers . The staff granted its wielder enhanced vampiric regeneration. Additionally, the wielder was able to tap into the staff's dark magics to summon an infestation of maggots (exhausted five charges), create a protective shield of negative energy protection (three charges per use), and cast negative energy ray at no cost. The staff held fifty charges.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The history of the staff of Konash was shrouded in legends and rumors, but no one knew its true origins. The staff often popped up throughout history in places ripe with great evil happenings. Many believed it to be cursed; however, if it were, the truth remained a mystery. Perhaps the most common school of thought about the staff of Konash was that it was wielded by a loyal servant of some long-forgotten evil god. Others claimed that the staff arrived at the surface world from the deepest part of the Underdark .</p>
<p>The staff ended up in the hands of a thoroughly evil drow cleric of Vhaeraun , Sieronius Dethick . The drow ended up being trapped in the tomb underneath Liam's Hold by a powerful wizard, Sunder Halyndliam , several centuries before 1372 DR . There, Sieronius was forcefully transformed into a vampire and bound to the crypts by an elaborate curse. In 1372 DR, Sieronius Dethick attempted to escape imprisonment by magically binding a woman to be his wife to satisfy the curse's criteria. The Hero of Daggerford got involved in this attempt and was offered the staff of Konash in exchange for a willing (or almost willing) person to be brought into the catacombs under Liam's Hold. It was unknown if the Hero claimed the enchanted staff or the vampire was released onto the world, still wielding the dreaded artifact.</p>
