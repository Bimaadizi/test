<p>Prendergast "Gast" Brokengulf was a noble in Waterdeep and heir to the Brokengulf family title in the latter part of the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>By the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , his hair was turning gray.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Prendergast preferred being in the wild lands outside the city. He had a narcissistic streak and was jealous of younger men who were trying to achieve the same level of success as he had achieved as a gladiator. He was fearful and somewhat depressed at the prospect of growing old.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He was an expert huntsman and had won much glory as a gladiator on the Field of Triumph in Waterdeep.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Prendergast eventually rose to become the Director of the Field of Triumph.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Gast was the first son of the patriarch of the family, but passed on the title to his younger brother Morus I because he wanted to continue his life as a hunter, gladiator, and agent for his family's business interests. He had a nephew, Morus Brokengulf II , who became Lord when his father passed away, but the younger Morus was a Tyrran zealot and turned over the day-to-day responsibilities of Lordship to his friend and mentor Gareth Cormaeril . Therefore, Prendergast was the heir to the title and had influence on but not total control of the family business.</p>
<p>Gast was good friends with Urtos Phylund II , but by the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR , he was infatuated with Aridarye Phylund (Urtos II's young stepmother), and would do anything for her. After she was widowed, they eventually married.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , Gast came to blows with Lord Kuldos Roaringhorn in the Twilight Hunters tavern when he asked Kuldos about a rumor he'd heard implicating the noble in a scandalous relationship with a young girl in an outlying village. The two sparring nobles were ejected into the street by Song , one of the co-owners and an accomplished wizardess , using a particularly strong gust of wind spell.</p>
<p>The entire Brokengulf family had a vendetta against Claugiyliamatar , the green dragon known as "Old Gnawbones".</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR , Aridarye Phylund used her influence over Prendergast to coerce him into arranging the accident that resulted in the death of her husband, Lord Urtos Phylund I . At the time, the elder Lord Phylund was estranged from his son, Urtos II, who was a close friend of Gast. Nevertheless, Gast was consumed with guilt over this evil deed for many years. Aridarye's plans to take control of the Phylund family's fortunes suffered a setback when Urtos II survived the attack that was intended to kill him. So, in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Gast and Aridarye wed, giving her much influence over the Brokengulf family business.</p>
<p>It was Aridarye that pushed Gast to become the Director of the Field of Triumph and to inaugurate the Champion's Games , not only to raise his prestige but also create business opportunities for both the Brokengulf and Phylund clans.</p>
