<p>Potato , also known as batata , was a type of tuber vegetable found in the Realms.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Maztican potatoes were claimed to be superior to the roots of the same name that were available in northern Faerûn, growing larger and firmer and staying fresh longer.</p>
<p>Rootstocks sold via Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue could be used to start a garden in almost any location, since the roots grew well even in poor conditions.</p>
<p>Potatoes had a bland taste and because of this were often eaten with other foods or smothered in sauces like tonthur-nut sauce .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
