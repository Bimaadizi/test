<p>Fire elementals were elementals formed from the element of fire .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They were fast and agile creatures whose touch could set objects aflame. Owing to their fiery nature, they were unable to enter water. They were capable of speaking Ignan although they rarely spoke.</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>Being elementals, these creatures did not require any air, food, drink, or sleep to survive.</p>
<p>Besides fire, these elementals had ichor flowing through their bodies, which could be used as a magical ingredient.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Fire elementals usually chose to burn opponents with their touch. They attacked ferociously, enjoying burning things in the material plane to cinders. The fire elemental might also slam an opponent, possibly causing them to catch fire.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The fire elemental Jogaoh was forcibly transported from his home plane to the world of Toril by the extraplanar being Imgig Zu . Employing a Lockstone , Imgig Zu then trapped the powerful fire elemental in the form of a weak dwarf, which in turn bound him to Toril. In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Vajra Valmeyjar and Priam Agrivar brought Jogaoh to the Lockstone, and the magical gem restored him to his true form. Jogaoh returned to his own plane.</p>
<p>A fire elemental emerged from the Great Door outside Waterdeep later in 1357 DR. Advised by his assistant Dunstanny , the wizard Parwyyd Hanifar used the elemental as a fire source for a pyrotechnics spell, causing fireworks that dazzled gargoyles and kenkus that also emerged from the Door.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<h3>Summoning</h3>
<p>These elementals could be summoned to the Prime Material plane through use of the spells conjure elemental , conjure fire elemental , conjure lesser fire elemental , Daltim's fiery protector , elemental servant , elemental summoning summon monster III , and summon monster VI .</p>
<p>There were also magical items that could achieve this, such as a brazier of commanding fire elementals , elemental gems , a fire elemental gem , the Elemental Scourge in Kossuth's House , the Incandescent Eye , the Zakharan instrument riqq of the efreet (but only if played by a bard or rawunin ), and the Tome of Twelve Seals .</p>
<p>In terms of divine magic , the specialty priests known as firewalkers were granted the power to summon a fire elemental once per day or incredibly powerful ones once per tenday by their deity Kossuth . Upon reaching a certain level of skill, firewalkers summoned their first fire elemental in a religious ceremony called Unity of Fire .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>They were considered favored monsters , and therefore often used as divine servants, by the following deities : Dumathoin , Flandal Steelskin , Gaerdal Ironhand , Gorm Gulthyn , or Kossuth .</p>
<p>They were often harnessed by fire giants as guardians for their strongholds.</p>
