<p>Z'dusk was an illithid psychic warrior and elocater of Oryndoll who served as a scout for the Council of Oryndoll in the 1370s DR .</p>
<p>Around 1374 DR , the Council learned of a lost fragment of an avatar of the illithid deity Ilsensine somewhere in Sembia (actually buried in a sandy cave on Sembia's coast). The Council hoped to sooth the god's anger by recovering the fragment and sent Z'dusk to retrieve it.</p>
<p>In turn, Z'dusk, remaining cowled and mysterious, hired the Stray Thoughts company in Sembia to hunt for the fragment, describing it as only a psionic artifact of unspecified nature and powers, for a 25,000 gp reward. Taking no chances, Z'dusk and the Council planned to hire a number of other adventurers and mercenaries for the same task, and intended to slay whoever got it first and take it from them, rather than pay up.</p>
