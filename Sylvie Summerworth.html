<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the army assembled by the Cult of the Absolute moved from the Moonrise Towers in Chionthar Valley to menace the city of Baldur's Gate , displacing countless refugees in the process along the way. However, Sylvie Summerworth was not particularly frightened by the encroaching army. Instead, she trash-talked the Sword Coast Courier pigeon mail services that continually suffered missing birds and undelivered letters. Her ire was so strong, Sylvie entertained the idea of buying and training her own pigeons. Unbeknownst to most, the pigeons were hunted and eaten by Gale Dekarios 's tressym named Tara , who recently followed her master to Baldur's Gate from Waterdeep .</p>
