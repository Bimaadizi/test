<p>Elminster's tower was the abode of perhaps the most famous, or infamous, spellcaster throughout Toril — Elminster Aumar .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Elminster's tower was found in the village of Shadowdale . It sat just south of the Old Skull near a small pond.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The tower stood only three stories tall. Kudzu vines covered nearly every one of the field stones used to form the structure. Numerous lean-tos and shacks had been added to the exterior to accommodate Elminster's growing collection of items both magical and mundane. The front of the tower was adorned with a simple wooden door.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The first floor of the tower held a simple kitchen and office. A spiral staircase led to the second floor, which held Elminster's personal quarters. An even smaller room was located on the third floor and was sometimes used as a work room for guests.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Though no one knew the extent of magical protection placed about the tower, it was wise to assume that Elminster's home was safe from unwanted intrusion.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Elminster built the squat tower sometime during the mid–9 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In addition to the mighty mage, Elminster's scribe and personal assistant, Lhaeo , was the only other nearly permanent resident. Elminster did, however, entertain visitors from time to time.</p>
<p>Narm Tamaraith and Shandril sheltered at the tower after surviving an attack in the Tower of Ashaba .</p>
