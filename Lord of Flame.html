<p>During the time of the Bloodforge Wars ( 648 â€“ 657 DR ), the wards failed and Tartyron broke free of his subterranean prison and into the world above, free to spread chaos through the Realms of Lands, Tides, and Fire, in an event known as Tartyron Unbound . The Lord of Flame, Lady of Tides, and Lord of Lands assembled to investigate his break out and made pursuit.</p>
