<p>Lanternlighter's was a shop in Skullport that sold lanterns. Located in the Dredge of the city, the establishment was owned and operated by Anderian Dusk , an elderly half-elf .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>While lanterns were readily available within the shop, oil was not offered by its proprietor. As the two items went hand-in-hand, any customers seeking lamp oil were referred by Anderian to the Overflowing Urn .</p>
<p>Those who walked into Lanternlighter's were unknowingly spied upon by the sea hags that dwelled within River Sargauth . This was accomplished by means of a magical amulet that Anderian Dusk wore around his neck, a service for which he was well-paid.</p>
