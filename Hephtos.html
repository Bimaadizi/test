<p>Hephtos was a dwarven street vendor, cleric of Vergadain , and author who lived in the city of Ravens Bluff in the 14 th century DR . However, even though worship of the Morndinsamman was legal and tolerated in the city, Hephtos chose to masquerade as a Tymoran cleric, one of the gods of Ravens Bluff's Civic Religion. He hoped that in doing, so he would improve his chances of ingratiating himself to both the Clerical Circle and the city's human populace, thereby lowering their guards and making his endeavors to coerce people out of their valuables that much easier.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hephthos was a man of portly build who stood 4 feet and 2 inches (1.3 meters) tall. He had brown eyes and a deep voice. And in his old age, the man's once red hair was balding and showing gray streaks.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>In addition to clerical spells , Hephthos was notably adept at cooking, building fires, handling animals, singing, and appraising the value of gems and jewelry . His arsenal of spells included cure light wounds , command , detect magic , enthrall , sanctuary , speak with animals , and withdraw .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Under his plain monastic robes Hepthos wore a suit of splint mail , black boots , and a belt pouch where he kept his spell components and potions of healing . Upon his belt he also kept his trusty morningstar within ready reach. While doing his street vendor work, he often wore a grease-stained apron atop the robes. He also proudly displayed holy symbols of Tymora & Vergadain around his neck, though the latter, a gold coin hung from a leather thong, was less conspicuous compared to the Tymoran silver disk.</p>
<p>The dwarf also owned a number of magic items that he utilized in his schemes. These included a ring of human influence , a ring of protection +1 , a stone of good luck , and horseshoes of speed . He had these horseshoes mounted upon his pet Sal , a trained one-eyed mule .</p>
<p>The food cart that Sal hauled around for the dwarf was brightly painted and kept stocked with foodstuffs, supplies, and utensils . It was also outfitted with a stove and oven . Additionally, the cart held the dwarf's other personal effects, such as a bedroll and the occasional line of laundry, strung from the chimney to the wooden front seat.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Often operating under the alias of Friar Cookpot, Hephthos started each day in Ravens Bluff by moving his food cart to either across the street from the Open Air Farmers Market , outside the city in Tent Town , or in the neighborhood of Seaglimpse just outside the Gates of the Watchful Raven . Once settled in a prominent spot, he would put on something aromatic to cook and break into song, all part of an effort to attract customers. However, his singing and boisterous style of cooking also served to masquerade what were in reality verbal and somatic components of his spells.</p>
<p>His skills in cooking were overall quite extraordinary, though his repertoire was largely limited to baked goods and dishes that involved beans . Hephthos was so enamored with the use of beans in cooking that he even authored two cookbooks, 1001 Ways to Cook Beans and Cobblers and Pies: Baked Beans Can Be Fun . By far his most favorite recipe, one that garnered him some notoriety, was L'Orange Beans Flambe with Slag Sauce.</p>
<p>Whilst he sold copies of his books from the cart, Hephthos passed out servings of whatever he cooked to crowds free of charge. He would then bring out a correction plate for donations, using that moment of close proximity to activate his ring of human influence and thus coerce people into giving him their valuables. If by any chance he was caught charming someone, the dwarf would cast sanctuary and work to disappear into the throng of people.</p>
