<p>Kelmarindar Oth was a wizard member of the so-called Knights of the Shore , defenders of the Firedrake Shores from the town of Port Kir in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR, Kelmarindar was an aging man who had two good-looking female apprentices â€“ Dazaratha and Haelume . Kelmarindar had an altercation with Volothamp Geddarm once over the scribe's affections towards the beautiful apprentices, who, according to Volo, were forced to carry heavy baskets from the market because master Oth was corpulent and lazy. When Volo's attention to Dazaratha and Haelume was discovered, Kelmarindar threatened him with being turned into a head of boiled cabbage and made sure the writer was not welcomed in Port Kir.</p>
