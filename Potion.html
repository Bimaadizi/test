<p>Potions , also known as elixirs or drafts , were types of liquid crafted by alchemists or spellcasters with intended magical or extraordinary effects, with some copying the effects of spells . Some would even say they were " spells in liquid form", with their imbibers being both the effective target and the caster, but without requiring any of the necessary skill in the Art . These were not to be confused with non-magical herbal concoctions, which were often referred to by herbalists as "potions".</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Potions were typically stored within vessels made of either glass, ceramic , alabaster , crystal , or metal. This included such things as bottles , jugs , pots , flasks , and vials . These were fitted with tight stoppers. In the continent of Zakhara , small crystal bottles were the typical vessel of choice. These bottles were slightly pyramid-shaped, with bases wider than their mouth, and were quite resilient to shattering. The average bottle was stoppered with a crystal, which was sealed in place with wax .</p>
<p>The actual "liquid" component of potions varied widely in appearance, taste, and odor. Being that they were liquids, it was extremely difficult to use potions whilst underwater. Some got around this by creating pockets of air or storing them within a bladder , specially fitter with a flexible stem and capped nozzle. When needing to imbibe, one would pinch the stem and keep it as such until they had removed the cap and put the nozzle to their lips.</p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>While the terms 'potion' and 'elixir' could be used interchangeably, following the Second Sundering distinct differences were noted in the liquids that brewers chose to label as 'elixirs'. An imbiber could benefit from multiple potion effects at one time, but could only benefit from one elixir effect at a time. Additionally, the effects of elixirs were often found to have a longer duration than those of potions.</p>
<p>Potions always radiated a detectable aura of magic, which could be analyzed to determine the school of magic of its effect. Being that they were magical in nature, a potion could potentially be negated by the spell dispel magic , items like a rod of cancellation , and dead-magic zones . However, the effects of a potion would continue to function if imbibed prior to entering a dead-magic zone.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>More so than in any other aspect of sorcery, there were many ways to achieve a desired potion. The ingredients needed to brew a potion varied with each effect, ranging from the mundane and easy to acquire to the rare and exotic, but it was always necessary to have more than one ingredient. These could include such things as gemstones , magical oils , water drawn from sacred sites, " drops fallen from the moon ", hydrae organs, roc eggs , and enchanted herbs , as well as mundane herbs, spices , and vegetables. The medicinal benefits of such plants often served as an indicator of what kind of magical effects they could be used to achieve. Plants could be incorporated into a potion as either extracts, distillates, in a dried form, or in a crushed powder form.</p>
<p>In terms of gemstones, frost agate and moss agate were commonly used in the brewing of all manner of potions, for they had an effect of stabilizing substances that would otherwise be volatile if mixed together.</p>
<h3>Producers</h3>
<p>Texts pre-dating the Year of Wild Magic often considered the brewing of potions to be the providence of alchemists , wizards , and priests . Some would even claim that specialty priests and wizards were limited by whatever their sphere or school of magic was. But in actuality, any spellcaster could brew a potion, so long as they knew the desired spell or had it prepared. Though the craft was also not simply limited to spellcasters, as many alchemists, apothecaries , and herbalists were found to brew potions.</p>
<p>In general, priests were known for brewing potions with effects relating to healing and cures. The painbearers of Ilmater stood out as being particularly skilled in the making of healing-type potions. And mystic wanderers were known to be quite skilled in the arts of potion brewing, being that they devoted themselves to life-long studies of the medicinal and poisonous uses of various fungi and plants.</p>
<p>Alchemists who were also arcane or divine spellcasters could go on to become master alchemists , individuals specialized in the art of brewing potions, becoming so skilled that they could manage to brew two to four potions in a single day. And self-taught mages, known as hedge-wizards , in many cases were found to learn the art of brewing potions sooner than proper mages.</p>
<p>Wizards with dedicated laboratories often used all manner of tools in their brewing, such as alembics , beakers , braziers , furnaces, and retorts . Master alchemists, likewise, needed alchemical laboratories to achieve their masterful results. And priests often did their brewing upon consecrated altars, using the tools of faith and prayer.</p>
<p>In the time between the Spellplague and the Second Sundering, many spellcasters performed the concocting of potions through means of a ritual called brew potion .</p>

<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<p>Beneath the waves of Faerûn 's Inner Sea , the aquatic races of Serôs developed their potions in the form of viscous substances, like a thick gelatinous paste of kelp , so as to get around the hurdles of imbibing in a fluid volume. They would typically carry these "potions" around in either clam shells or flexible tubes made from eelskins .</p>
<p>On the desert world of Athas , water was more precious than gold and thus too valuable to be wasted on potions. In their place, the Athasians developed potion fruit , fruits and berries that contained potion-like effects in their juices. Some individuals on Toril , like Fent-Moyer Thrist Hauser of the Vast, developed trees that similarly bore fruits with potion-like effects .</p>

<p>Many wizards believed that Mystra , the goddess of magic, determined whether or not any attempt to brew a potion ended in success.</p>
