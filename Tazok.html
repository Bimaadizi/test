<p>Tazok was an ogre bandit leader, agent of the Iron Throne , and a devoted follower of the Bhaalspawn Sarevok .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was an exceptionally savage and cruel individual.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point during his career as a bandit, Tazok and his band captured and tortured the lovers Kivan and Deheriana . Only Kivan made it out alive, swearing revenge against Tazok when all was said and done.</p>
<p>Tazok was an instrumental figure of the iron crisis that plagued the Sword Coast in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR . He coordinated the efforts of the Chill and Blacktalons banditry efforts while guiding their leaders Ardenor Crush and Taurgosz Khosann to believe they were in fact working for the Zhentarim rather than the Iron Throne.</p>
<p>By means of his subordinate Tranzig , he also supervised the sabotage of the iron mine of Nashkel . He made periodic visits to the Cloak Wood to see his superior Davaeorn .</p>
<p>Later that year, Tazok stood by Sarevok's side when the Bhaalspawn made his last stand against his half-brother Abdel Adrian .</p>
<p>Tazok somehow survived that encounter and later traveled south to Amn . the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR Tazok had resettled in the Windspear Hills region of Amn .</p>
