<p>An ice necklace of the Ulutiun was a type of magic necklace that originated from the Great Glacier .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Each necklace was made up of six acorn-sized ice crystals that had been magically hardened and preserved. Two of these crystals were opaque, while the other four were transparent.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When one of these crystals was detached and thrown by the wearer at a distance of 80 feet (24 meters) or less, the crystal would explode upon reaching the end of its trajectory and unleash one of two spell effects depending upon the type of crystal. The opaque crystals would unleash an effect similar to the spell sleet storm , while the transparent crystals caused an effect similar to the spell ice storm .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These necklaces were said to have been created by a half-mad sorcerer that wandered among the Ulutiun tribes of the Great Glacier.</p>
