<p>The Nether Mountains were a chain of dark peaks that once marked the boundary between the ancient empires of Netheril and Delzoun .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Many travelers avoided these peaks, because several orc tribes laired in the region, such as the Thousand Fists and the Ripped Gut tribes who fought ferociously over the Moon Pass , a large gorge that split the mountains into its eastern and western ranges. Around 1372 DR , the orcs made an uneasy truce, making them an even greater threat to anyone traveling the region.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The greatest danger within these mountains were an entire clan of blue dragons known as the Morueme which resided in Morueme's Cave on the high slope of the mountain peak aptly named Dragondoom . The dragons ' threat was only enhanced by the servitude of a large tribe of hobgoblins called the Red Flayers , who maintain the Doomspire , a citadel carved into the rock, and protect their masters with an almost deific reverence.</p>

<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The peaks were also home to dozens of other dangerous monster species making them one of the most inhospitable wild regions in all Faerûn . There were even suggestions that portals or deepspawn were responsible for the amazing abundance of monsters roaming the higher slopes of the Nether Mountains. For those daring enough to brave the dangers, gold , silver , and copper could be mined in quantity. Finally, many adventurers hunted the mountains in search of the legends of lost caches of Netherese magic.</p>
<p>Following the destruction of Hellgate Keep in 1369 DR , five tribes of displaced tanarukka began to wander these mountains, numbering over 1,200 in all.</p>
