<p>Selfaril Uomodolphin was the High Blade of Mulmaster during the mid-late 14 th century DR , until he was secretly supplanted in 1368 DR . He was a conniving ruler who maintained a tight grip on his city.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Selfaril was a pragmatic man, ready to deal with all kinds of beings to regain his lost power. He never liked the Church of Bane , however, and thought Jaseen's overthrow was his perfect instrument of revenge against the Banites and their High Imperceptor. Selfaril was a brilliant politician, always portraying himself as a strong, fearless leader who was betrayed because of his progressive ideals.</p>
<p>Like his twin brother, Selfaril was tall, over 6' (1.8 m) with fair but weathered skin and a hawk-like nose.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Selfaril was born in 1319 DR and was close with his twin brother Rassendyll growing up. When Selfaril killed the ruler of Mulmaster, his own father, in 1348 DR , he assumed the title of High Blade. Selfaril was unable to risk keeping Rassendyll within the city, yet could not bring it upon himself to kill his brother. Instead he "promoted" the lesser son to the role of an ambassador to the city of Waterdeep , while in reality, the appointment was more of an exile.</p>
<p>In Ches of 1356 DR , he began courting Tharchioness Dmitra Flass of Eltabbar in an effort to draw the magocratic nation into an alliance with Mulmaster. After receiving a perfume-scented golden earring, he offered her a perfectly-white cloak made from the fur of a yeti . Their relationship took a long time to fully develop, but was to culminate in their marriage in 1368 DR . However, Selfaril's twin brother Rassendyll Uoumdolphin seized power that year, and replaced him in coup aided by wizards of the Zhentarim . Dmitra Flass was completely unaware of this ruse, and ended up marrying the imposter. Selfaril, meanwhile, was magically imprisoned by Senior Cloak Thurndan Tallwand in a soulgem in the pommel of his sword.</p>
<p>He remained trapped in his sword for more than a century. In 1491 DR , the sword resurfaced in the Earthspur Mountains and Thurndan, who disliked the current High Blade Jaseen Drakehorn , decided to take the blade and finally free Selfaril. Selfaril was upset to say the least. He had, for over a hundred years, done little other than seethe over the injustice of his twin brother's betrayal. With the help of some adventurers, Thurndan gained possession of the blade and resurrected the former High Blade.</p>
<p>Selfaril gained support among the citizens of Mulmaster and challenged Jaseen to a public duel.</p>
