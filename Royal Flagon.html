<p>The Royal Flagon was a fairly unremarkable, though well-patroned, tavern located in Tegal's Mark , Tasseldale , during the midâ€“14 th century DR . Despite, or perhaps because of, its less-than-memorable features it was a great place for sell-swords to find work and travelers to hear news and gossip.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Flagon had low-priced ale served in giant tankards, which, along with its convenient location, helped add to its popularity among the folk of Tasseldale. They had a policy of "no music, no fighting".</p>
