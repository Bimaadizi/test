<p>A bit and bridle was an essential piece of tack, consisting of a mouthpiece and a head harness to control a mount.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These coupled items were often essential for riding mounts, particularly horses . The bridle was a large set of leather straps or a rope set around a mount's lower jaw. Bits came in many types. A bit could be inserted into a horse's mouth and attached to the bridle.</p>
<p>Bits and bridles were sold all over Faerûn , Zakhara , and Kara-Tur . Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue sold bits and bridles, and were suitable for those embarking on a lengthy journey or participating in a race.</p>
<p>The phantom steed spell summoned a spectral mount with both bit and bridle and a saddle .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the beloved Zakharan horse , Edimu , passed from the world, a mausoleum was constructed for him in Sokkar . Edimu's golden bit and bridle were buried alongside him. However, ghouls later looted the chambers, stealing the valuable gem -studded bit and bridle and breaking the ka figure it rested upon, thus bringing Edimu's spirit back from the afterlife. In 1367 DR , the legendary spirit horse asked a group of adventurers to recover his bit and bridle. The heroes were successful in their task, and Edimu's spirit was finally laid to rest.</p>
