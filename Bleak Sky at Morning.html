<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bleak Sky wore a large metal helmet, a huge furred coat and set of gloves. The shaman also carried a spear and a shield .</p>
<p>The ancient shaman ruled over 200 people, and was said to have incredible patience and a sense of humor.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1358 DR , the ruler himself guarded the entrance to the steepest climb of the Ice Peak . Bleak Sky and his ancestors, for about 600 years, had watched over the entrance to the great climb. The Heroes of Ascore , having proved their might and loyalty to goodly folk across Faerûn , wished to ascend the peak—they needed to stop the Zhentarim and their allies from acquiring Freezefire 's gem. Bleak Sky at Morning granted them permission.</p>
