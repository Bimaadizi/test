<p>Garumn's Climb was a trade route through the West Galena Mountains that connected Vaasa to the Moonsea North . It was the longer of the two routes connecting Vaasa and the Moonsea , with the other going through Gramble's Climb to the south.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The trail that passed through Garumn's Climb originated at its Vaasan end in the village of Avang at the terminus of Dead Man's Walk , the primary eastâ€“west route across the Vaasan tundra. From there, it ran west up and over the Climb to reach the Moonsea North. The trail on the eastern side of the mountains was steep enough that it could be descended in a day, and afforded a broad view of Vaasa, while the trail on the western side was narrow and hard. The highest point of the pass was marked by a stack of five boulders.</p>
<p>From the pass, the road then crossed the remains of the Kingdom of Barze before passing through the Vercy Wood and ending in the village of Ilinvur north of Thar. From there, caravans could continue on the Ilinvur Trail to reach points further west or south.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to the 15 th century DR , Garumn's Climb was an important step in the overland trade route running between Damara and the lands to the west. Merchant caravans would cross Vaasa between Garumn's Climb and Bloodstone Pass , closely linking the fortunes of the two. Until the opening of Gramble's Climb , this trek was shorter than alternative routes between Damara and the Heartlands, although it was often avoided owing to Vaasa's harsh terrain and the risk of monster attacks, which necessitated large accompaniments of armed guards. The route saw heavier usage during periods when shipping access to the Moonsea was made difficult, such as by increased pirate or monster activity.</p>
<p>When the Warlock Knights seized Vaasa in the late 15 th century DR, they sealed Bloodstone Pass and thus constrained trade going to and from Damara. Garumn's Climb became an important route for exports from the Knights' new realm in Vaasa, and even when the quicker route through Gramble's Climb was reopened in the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR , mines in western Vaasa like Delhalls continued to export copper and bloodstone over Garumn's Climb.</p>
<p>That same year, refugees from Ilinvur and other settlements in the Ride began arriving in Avang via the Climb after barbarians and elementals sacked Ilinvur.</p>
