<p>Hilp was a small town in southern Cormyr . It was located on Calantar's Way between Immersea to the northeast and Suzail to the southwest. Hilp marked the western terminus of the Way of the Manticore , which ran east to the town of Wheloon and beyond.</p>

<p>A shrub known as stelk was grown commercially in Hilp as fish bait. A stelk shrub resembled a cluster of brown, fist-sized cabbage heads. Aquatic creatures, from goldfish to dragon turtles , were unable to resist it. A species of freshwater electric eel inhabited the Lake of Dragons that could release an electrical discharge deadly to humans . Any eel eating a head of stelk was unable to use this ability for a week.</p>

<h2>Rumors and Legends</h2>
<p>Orncibl Rhommd was a weaver of Hilp who, along with his two apprentices, claimed to have stumbled upon the location of the Crypt of Dragons in 1356 DR . The Crypt was a vast subterranean tomb and shrine to the dragon god Null , somewhere within a day's travel of Hilp, though the exact location was long forgotten. Orncibl said that the tomb contained several mummified dragon corpses laying upon piles of gold and gems . Orncibl's apprentices were killed by fields of blue energy when they got too close, but Orncibl escaped. Unfortunately, he disappeared before he could reveal the cavern's whereabouts, and ever since that time, agents of the Cult of the Dragon searched the region for the entrance to the Crypt.</p>
