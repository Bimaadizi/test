<p>Brack'thal Xorlarrin was a drow wizard of House Xorlarrin in Menzoberranzan in the 14 th and 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to the Spellplague , Brack'thal was a powerful wizard favored by Matron Mother Zeerith Q'Xorlarrin . The Spellplague turned him half-mad and half-comatose. After the death of the house patron, Horroodissomoth Xorlarrin , Zeerith turned to her own son for heirs, producing Ravel from his loins.</p>
<p>Brack'thal was ordered by his mother to accompany the expedition led by Ravel to Gauntlgrym in the Year of the Reborn Hero, 1463 DR . But empowered by his ability to tame the fire elementals and frustrated with his increasingly weak position in the family, he sabotaged the Forge and set fire elementals to attack the workers. While doing so, he was confronted by Drizzt Do'Urden , Artemis Entreri , and Dahlia Sin'felle , who were trying to reach the pit of the primordial Maegera . He attacked them and Entreri drew the killing blow.</p>
<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>Brack'thal was skilled in elemental magic . He learned his wizardry before the Spellplague, so his repertoire was considered outdated by the new "spellspinners" of House Xorlarrin. However, his old-fashioned magic worked better against fire elementals than that of the spellspinners.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Brack'thal had a magical ruby ring that controlled fire elementals. Just before his death at the hands of Artemis Entreri, this ring was taken from him by Drizzt Do'Urden.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Brack'thal was the son of Zeerith Q'Xorlarrin . He was both the half-brother and father of Ravel Xorlarrin .</p>
