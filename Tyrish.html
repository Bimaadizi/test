<p>Tyrish was a legendary Pharaoh from the days of Mulhorandi antiquity.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tyrish was considered ancient many human generations before the 14 th century DR . The legends of Tyrish talked about the Pharaoh possibly possessing divine powers. Ancient female slaves were said to pray to Tyrish during the full moon after giving birth to daughters. Legends claimed that if their prayers were heard, Tyrish sent them a magic stiletto , later known as Winged Blight . The knife was used to mutilate the women's daughters in order to save them from being perceived as valued by slavers, eventually leading to the girls' freedom. With each child cut, Winged Blight grew slightly bigger.</p>
<p>The authenticity of these stories was unknown; however, by the early 14 th century DR, Winged Blight was to the size of a massive greatsword .</p>
