The Circle of Friends operated under lower profit margins making their methods and prices popular among consumers. Their methods, however, did have some opponents, including certain members of the Church of Waukeen who thought that discounted goods were beneficial to the consumers of Faer√ªn , but unhealthy for market competition.</p>
