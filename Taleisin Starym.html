<p>Taleisin Starym was a clan elder and Lord Protector of the Starym elven clan, uncle by marriage of Ysmyrl'da Starym . He was a bladesinger and former member of the Akh'Velahr as an aryk√©rym cavalry. Taleisin, along with the clan heir Josidiah Starym were elves of great honour, and after the clan broke ties with the Coronal and most abandoned Myth Drannor , these two rebuilt the reputation of the family.</p>
