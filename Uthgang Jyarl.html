<p>Uthgang Jyarl was the head of the Tall Trees druidic order and the reputed Great Druid of the North.</p>
<p>Not much was known of the goals of the druidic other than their desire to protect that portion of the woods that was once part of Earlann . Very few were allowed access to the Tall Trees enclave save a few allied Harpers , and notable figures of good, with whom they had some mutual alliance. Like most nature faiths, they also sought to keep a balance between wild lands and civilization. The Deep Glade , the key grove of Silvanus was to be found in Tall Trees.</p>
