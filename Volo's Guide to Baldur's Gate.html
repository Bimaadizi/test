<p>Volo's Guide to Baldur's Gate was a book penned by Volothamp Geddarm , available in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>Likely surprisingly for many, given Volo's previous works, Volo's Guide to Baldur's Gate was a staggeringly accurate guidebook of the city of Baldur's Gate . It held multitudes of stories about the city's grimy streets, information about its many rowdy taverns, and accounts of strange characters who inhabited the Gate.</p>
<p>According to Elminster, who edited Volothamp Geddarm's manuscript, the writer claimed that the Black Dragon Gate , which divided Blackgate from the entirety of the Upper City , was a living being, to which Elminster disagreed. The manuscript also featured a hand-drawn map of the city, penned by Volo's own hand, to which Elminster commented that the author needed to hire a mapmaker for the task.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a copy of the manuscript could be found discarded by Volo in the ruins of Moonhaven in the Western Heartlands .</p>
