<p>Crimson battan were a type of freshwater fish found in the western tributaries of Al-Adib River in west Zakhara .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These fish were as long as a man's arm. Their scales were a deep crimson.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Native Zakharans would catch these fish by tossing small stones over the water. The fish would leap out of the water to swallow the stones, mistaking them for small birds . When enough stones had been swallowed the crimson battan would sink to the bottom of the river where it was easily harvested by fishermen.</p>
<p>Zakharans enjoyed fried crimson battan mixed with goose eggs , water, wheat flour, and cucumber juice . The fish was then placed in a pan of camel fat and fried until the scales flaked off at the touch of a knife.</p>
