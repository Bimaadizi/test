<p>Rain Bird Rooming House was an inn in Waterdeep during the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>One of the doors in the kitchens had a peeling figure of a wizard, painted blue. This door was actually a portal of sorts.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the early spring of 1373Â DR , Elminster Aumar walked out of the portal with the peeling blue paint, and conversed briefly with his old friend, Phaerorn , telling him the news about his son in Suzail . Phaerorn then explained to his scullery boy, Naviskurr , that the man was actually Elminster and that was why nothing should block that door; Naviskurr fainted after Elminster left.</p>
