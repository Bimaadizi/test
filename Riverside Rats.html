<p>The Riverside Rats were a gang of wererats who lived in Wheloon Prison during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Rats were relatively benign as far as Wheloon gangs went, and much preferred to sneak and spy over fighting and struggling. They enjoyed a semi-sanctioned state with the Cormyrean jailkeepers, who allowed them a level of mischief in exchange for not causing problems (and significant bribery). When the Sharran Night Brigade gang fell upon them, the Rats were almost destroyed, with many slain or taken captive. They sought aid from adventurers outside the walls of the prison and helped to sneak them in via the Wererat's Entrance , giving them special talismans that let them transform into rats . This allowed their hired allies to sneak past the Night Brigade defenses and assault their leadership directly.</p>
<p>First the Rats committed a strike on the Battlemaster's Arenas , rescuing a number of captive wererats and slaying Agarta the Breaker . Then they struck at the Master Thief's Hideout and caught Karissa the Knife in her lair with no escape. The twisted Darstil Vurusk was assassinated in his tower , ending his mad experiments. Finally, they attacked the Temple of Shar that Storna Harnwood had built atop the ruins of their nests. By the light of Sel√ªne , the darkness of Shar was dispelled from the temple and the priestess slain, putting an end to the gang and allowing the Riverside Rats to finally return home.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
