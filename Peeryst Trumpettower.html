He also received a statue known as the Stag of Athalantar. However, shortly after the toast at their bridal chamber, the newlyweds were attacked by the Moonclaws gang, and a fight resulted as they clashed with the Velvet Hands gang, which also tried to burgle the couple on their bridal night. Only the intervention of Darrigo Trumpettower finally evicted the thieves, though they caused much damage to their possessions in the meantime.</p>
<p>Later in the Year of the Chosen, 240 DR , Peeryst Trumpettower was in Athalgard with his wife during the invasion of the forces under Prince Elminster Aumar , who sought to overthrow his uncle Belaur Aumar and stop the Magelords of Athalantar who ruled for him. As Peeryst thought to check what the alarm was about, a soldier ran into him, making him fall and break his nose against the wall. As his wife came to check on him, fellow nobleman Jansibal Otharr , scrambling to his post, injured his wife, cutting into her arm with the sword he had out. His uncle decided to take the fight to Jansibal, took Peryst's blade, and told him to bind Nanue's wounds.</p>
