<p>Firebreak was a suit of magical plate armor found in Thorngap , a druidic circle in Cormyr during the mid-1480s DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The armor was a light set of plate, using a combination of rigid and flexible segments.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The plate was enchanted to heavily resist heat and fire, and even produced its own blue fire shield of cold flames. It also broadly protected the wearer beyond normal capabilities, and slowly regenerated wounds.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Firebreak was found in the possession of a group of drow males that escaped the Underdark , only to emerge inside the Druid's Deep inside Thorngap. Their attempt to conquer and enslave the surface world was short-lived.</p>
