<p>Haskar Corintis was the leader of Ormpetarr 's thieves' guild in the nation of Sespech in the mid and late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As Thuragar Foemaster , an adventurer of some renown, rose to rule the nation of Sespech in the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR , the new Baron denounced the puppet-control of Chondath and imposed strict laws on the previously lax nation. The citizens of Sespech welcomed the new ruler and being free from Arrabar 's influence at long last. However, not all shared the sentiment. Haskar Corintis and his thieves' guild promptly rebelled against the rigid laws of Baron Foemaster. Haskar, financed by Arrabar, staged bandit raids on merchant caravans and sparked several bloody battles on the streets of Ormpetarr.</p>
