<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Time of Troubles in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , the sage of Shadowdale Elminster took the young magic-user Midnight to the temple, in order to complete a ritual that would bring forth the Eye of Eternity . Due to the instability of the Weave he inadvertently opened a portal to the plane of Gehenna . Meanwhile, the avatar of the god Bane and an elemental form of Mystra fought a terrible battle at the temple, as Elminster attempted to close the otherworldly rift. As the Celestial Stairway opened up above them, Bane was destroyed, Elminster dove through the portal to close it from the other side, and Morningdawn Hall was leveled in the ensuing explosion.</p>
<p>Years later, after the Zhentarim invasion in Hammer of the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR , Morningdawn Hall destroyed for the second time, this time in a great fire. The clergy of Lathander were all killed or forced to flee the village of Shadowdale.</p>
