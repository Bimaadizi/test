<p>Cania was one of the three dryads enslaved by Jon Irenicus and trapped in his dungeon circa 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cania had pale skin and bright green hair.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ulene , Elyme , and Cania were captured by the cruel archmage Jon Irenicus sometime before the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR . He trapped the dryads by transporting their oak trees into his dungeon underneath the city of Athkatla in Amn . Cania and her fellow slaves were used as concubines and playthings. When Abdel Adrian escaped his capture, he encountered the three dryads begins for his aid. The only way for Ulene, Elyme, and Cania to escape was through their trees. They asked the Bhaalspawn to bring acorns from their trees back to the Fairy Queen of the Windspear Hills , who would be able to drop the oaks, allowing the dryads to step through their trees to freedom and allowing the captured trees in the dungeon to wilt away and die. It was unrecorded if Cania was ever granted her freedom.</p>
