<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These axes possessed a +2 enchantment and made the wielder completely immune to death magic .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Deepstone Progeny axe was modeled after the weapon wielded by a renowned undead hunter Torgin of the Light, until he was turned into that which he hated the most, a vampire. Torgin's comrades made an oath to end Torgin's existence as a bloodsucking creature of the night. They enchanted at least several copies of Deepstone Progeny and took the weapons to battle their old friend. History books did not know what happened next; however, Deepstone Progenies eventually started appearing across Faerûn .</p>
