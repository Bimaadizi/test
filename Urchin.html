<p>Urchins were a family of marine scavenging animals valued for gems and pearls found inside their bodies.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A typical urchin was 3 feet (91 centimeters) in diameter. They were round creatures covered with thousands of 3 inches (0.076 meters) sharp needles. Different subspecies of urchins could be easily distinguished by their color: black, green, red, silver, and yellow.</p>
<p>One of the more distinct subspecies was the land urchin. Unlike their distant cousins, they lived on land and moved about on five scrawny legs.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Urchins were non-aggressive scavengers, feeding on fish and shellfish found on seabeds. Urchins never attacked humanoid -sized opponents unless threatened.</p>
<p>Most commonly, sea-dwelling urchins could be found on shoals and shallows near coasts. On occasions, they could be seen on land during low tides, quickly rolling around, looking to scavenge.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Urchins were eyeless creatures; instead of sight, they had an innate clairvoyance ability on which they relied in combat.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>When pressed, urchins could fire their sharp spines with the aim and distance of a light crossbow . Different subspecies of urchins could fire multiple spines at a time (black and green: 2 spines; red: 3; yellow: 4; silver: 5; land: 6). The number of spines on their bodies that could be fired offensively was virtually unlimited and some types of urchins had paralytic and deadly poisons inside the spines.</p>
<p>The land urchins were shy critters and only attacked if someone approached them within 10 feet (3 meters). The main method of self-defense was their paralytic poison that lasted if injected for 36 seconds.</p>
<h2>Species</h2>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Urchins served as a food source for fish and some humanoids.</p>
<h3>Usages</h3>
<p>The best-known item for which urchins were sought after was their crystalline organ-gem. Sages connected the urchins' clairvoyance to the gem-organs, making it highly valuable to alchemists. The value of the organ-gem varied depending on the subspecies, from 10–2500 gold pieces .</p>
<p>Unlike their marine cousins, land urchins did not have organ-gems but quite often formed pearls inside their bodies with age. An older land urchin could hold between 2 and 12 pearls. A land urchin pearl was valued based on their shape and size, between 100 and 600 gold pieces each.</p>
<p>Yellow urchin poison, also known as yellow urchin extract , was valued among all the types of urchins for its ability to be effective while inhaled underwater, unlike other types of poison. When extracted, it appeared to as a thick and milky fluid. When used underwater it created a cloud of poison 10 feet (3 meters) wide, dispersing after 10 minutes, or 1 minute in a strong current. A vial of this unique poison was valued at 800 gold pieces.</p>
<p>Various species of urchin were known to be eaten raw with a drizzle of lemon juice on the coastal areas to the south from Icewind Dale.</p>
<p>A spell called urchin's spines required an urchin's spine to be used as an arcane component . It transmuted the caster's skin, clothing, and armor into a hide covered in thousands of 2 inches (0.051 meters) spines.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the days of Myth Nantar and As'arem , an abundance of kelp and urchins served as a big part of their food harvest.</p>
<p>Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun possessed two scrying orbs that were urchin gems of 15 inches (0.38 meters) in diameter. One of them was gifted to him by Elminster Aumar . Blackstaff appreciated their esthetics as well as their sturdiness compared to other types of scrying orbs.</p>
<h2>Notable Urchins</h2>
<h2>Magic</h2>
<p>A black urchin could be summoned by the summon monster I spell when in saltwater environments. For those who specialized in sea magic between 2 and 8 would arrive instead of the usual singe creature that heeded the call of other spell-users. Green urchins could be called upon with the Summon monster II spell, and while most spellslingers would summon a single specimen, the sea magicians would have between 1 and 6 of the creatures heed the call. A red urchin would be called with the Summon monster III spell, while the sea magic specialization would result in 1 to 4 of the creatures. With Summon monster IV it would be a yellow uchin that was summoned, and again the sea magicians would call between 1 and 3 of the creatures. Finally once could call upon the mighty silver urchins with Summon monster V , and here those who had specialized in the magic of the sea would have 1 or 2 of the monsters answer the call.</p>
