<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Pilos Lafrett , a lazy yet industrious fisherman, invented a device of pulleys and balanced weights that would do the fishing on its own, allowing Pilos a stress-free nap. He informed his boss Tohil of the invention and that it would be producing labor-free halibut , but asked him not to touch the invention, while cockily also asking for a raise.</p>
