<p>The Craftsman's hammer was an ordinary-looking hammer that somehow became enchanted with its magics going without notice until 1312 DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Craftsman's hammer was designed as a tool. It was slower and heavier than similarly-sized warhammer when wielded in battle. Each swing with the craftsman's hammer was more deadly than that of an ordinary hammer. Its +1 enchantment created a clear ringing note when lightly tapped.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In or shortly before Mirtul of 1312 DR, the craftsman's hammer was used to build palisades in the the town of Targos of Icewind Dale being the period of time the Ten-Towns were menaced by the Legion of the Chimera . It was likely none of the workers detected the weapon's magical properties and eventually traded it to the Gallaway Trade Depot . The hammer ended up being available for purchase from Deirdre Gallaway in her trading company's store in Targos the same year.</p>
