<p>Maralie Fiddlebender was a gnome who helped her uncle, Oswald Fiddlebender , with his airship in the late 13 th and early 14 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>She resided in Kuldahar with her uncle, Oswald, where she helped him with his potions , spells and airship. She explained to a group of adventurers that she was made to wear a rope as a harness, restraining jacket, and helmet, so that she was safe on the ship. Her uncle noted in his spellbook that Maralie gave him invaluable assistance.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Maralie was a naïve, young gnomish girl, who believed many of the crazy stories Oswald would tell her. She was very small, and thought this might be due to the constant air pressure she was exposed to on her travels (another of her uncle's stories). Her uncle also told her that her head was too small for her age. Being clumsy, Maralie tried to fit her head in everything, such as little jars . She also licked out the potion bowls .</p>
<p>Maralie noted that she didn't get any bumps on one particular trip, suggestion that her clumsiness came from repeated bangs to the head, from her uncle's poor piloting. She later became independent, traveled around Faerûn , and wrote a book.</p>
<p>She was friendly with the archdruid , Iselore , who would let her sit on his lap. He would tell her how all the flowers in Kuldahar grew.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Maralie once lived with her parents—Oswald's brother and his wife—but then goblins attacked their village. She was separated from her parents, and came under her uncle's care. She then lived in Kuldahar with her uncle, who was known for piloting (and crashing) a flying ship. After the yuan-ti started to attack Kuldahar, she moved to Targos with her uncle and the other villagers.</p>
<p>She left the comforts of her home to journey towards Deepingdale , the origin of Kuldahar's archdruid, Iselore . Iselore told his fellow druids that he needed a student to replace him; Maralie told herself that this was the reason she left.</p>
<p>Later in life, she wrote an illustrated book detailing the events that revolved around the goblin uprising in northwest Faerûn , known as the Legion of the Chimera . The book was written in Mirabar , beside a fire.</p>
