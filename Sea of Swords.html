<p>The Sea of Swords was a region of the Trackless Sea that separated the western coast of Faerûn (known as the Sword Coast ) from the Nelanther Isles and the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The major island chains of the Moonshaes and the Nelanther Isles and the jutting Tethyr Peninsula formed a rough boundary for the Sea of Swords. However, various authors have described the Sea of Swords as extending around the peninsula to meet the Purple Cliffs (the western edge of the Purple Hills in Tethyr ). On the northern end, at least one author placed the island of Ruathym in the Sea of Swords, and another added the island of Gundarlun and even the Purple Rocks . It was not unusual for the Sea of Swords to be considered extending as far north as Luskan .</p>
<p>Prevailing winds in the northern parts of the Sea of Swords tended to blow west-to-east. A major current known as the Southern Drift moved south along the Swrod Coast before turning west toward Maztica once it had passed the Moonshae Isles. A northward current flowed from the coast of Alaron of the Moonshae Isles toward Waterdeep.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>At least one kingdom of sea elves , known as Nindrol , claimed the waters around the island of Toaridge-at-the-Sun's-Setting just north of the Nelanther (or the northernmost island of that group, according to some maps ).</p>
<p>Many explorers and pirates , like Shala Lonstur or Bob Holmes , made the Sea of Swords practically their second home through their constant voyages.</p>
