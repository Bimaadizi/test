<p>The Inverted Tower was the center for the study of arcane magic in Szith Morcane .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The stronghold was so named because of its unusual construction of rooms branching off from a tall, octagonal cavern. Without stairs connecting the various levels only those with capability to levitate or climb the smooth walls could navigate the Inverted Tower effectively.</p>
<p>Among the connecting rooms was a chamber for instructing students in the art of spellcraft and a room dedicated to the summoning of extraplanar creatures.</p>
<h2>Defences</h2>
<p>Boasting a complement of wizard fighters known as the Arcane Guard , the tower had additional protection in the form of a contingent guards and wards spell. This was keyed to activate whenever any creature entered the spire without speaking the password, " B'zadaara ".</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Despite the fall of House Morcane in 1372 DR and the decline of drow in the region after the Silence of Lolth , the Inverted Tower's insular community remained largely unaffected by the turmoil.</p>
