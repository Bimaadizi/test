<h2>History</h2>
<p>Maztica was originally the name of the Maztican goddess of earth and life. It was believed that she, along with her husband and her children (the other deities of the Maztican pantheon ), created the land, the plants and animals, and humans. Early in the continent's history, the gods Qotal and Zaltec fought over it, until a crime against his sister caused Qotal to retreat from the land for ages.</p>
<p>Later on, the Payit people of Payit and Far Payit built a mighty civilization. They were a peaceful people, but they gained much knowledge and wisdom during their golden age. They also built great cities of stone and made wondrous works of art and pluma . However, the Golden Age of Payit eventually came to an end in treachery and murder.</p>
<p>Shortly after the golden age ended, a tribe of Dog People arrived in the western Valley of Nexal. The Valley of Nexal had its own people, and their own culture, but that small tribe eventually built a city-state of their own, Nexal. They went on to conquer and rule a mighty empire, the greatest in Maztica, for almost 300 years.</p>
<p>Maztica was 'discovered' by Amnian explorers led by Captain Cordell and his Golden Legion in the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR . Amn was quick to lay its claim to the land for trade benefits, establishing the port city of Helmsport . The invaders ruthlessly conquered the native peoples and extracted the land's natural resources. The church of Helm playing a key part in this, tainting its reputation back in Faerûn. Lantan also claimed some lands.</p>
<p>Some tlincallis from Maztica teleported to Oaxaptupa under Amn in the Underdark of Faerûn .</p>
<p>During the Spellplague of 1385 DR , Maztica was subsumed by the wild magic and sent to the world of Abeir . People mistakenly believed it was replaced by a continent of that world that was sent to Toril during the catastrophe, Laerakond . Maztica was returned to Toril during the Second Sundering, around 1486 or 1487 DR . A few tabaxi emigrated to Faerûn after that, although the tabaxi never talked about what changes Maztica may have experienced in her century in another world, besides the fact that there were some strange changes.</p>
<p>Maztica was still marked on maps of Toril following the Second Sundering in the late 1400s DR .</p>
<h2>Politics</h2>
<p>Maztica was dominated by the nations of Nexal , Kultaka , Huacli , Kolan , Pezelac and Payit . However, there were many other groups and tribes within its mountains and jungles and deserts.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Maztica was primarily inhabited by humans . These humans were split into four basic ethnic groups, the Payits , the Nexalans , the Green Folk , and the North Ones (more commonly called the Dog People).</p>
<p>In addition, wild halflings were said to live in the deepest jungles of Far Payit, and desert dwarves inhabited the House of Tezca desert.</p>
