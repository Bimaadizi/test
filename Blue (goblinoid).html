<p>Blues were a psionic variant of goblin .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Blues were typically smaller than regular goblins, with distinctive blue-tinged skin.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Since most goblin tribes would readily kill blues just for being different, those blues that survived to adulthood tended to be paranoid and cunning as well as cruel.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Blues were set apart from regular goblins by their innate psionic powers. At will, a blue could use charm person , far hand , or finger of fire . They readily augmented their natural abilities by training as psions .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>When they fought, blues preferred to support other goblins from the back of the group.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Just because they were different, blues were typically poorly integrated into their tribes at best- at worst, a tribe would kill blues at birth. Where they lived, common goblins railed against them and leaders distrusted them, despite their usefulness. This generally meant a blue lived in a cave of their own, but since they were dependent on the tribe for their well-being and protection, they couldn't go too far.</p>
<p>In some tribes that had multiple blues, a "Council of Blue" might form, secretly manipulating the leaders to control the tribe from behind the scenes. Such tribes were invariably more dangerous than ordinary tribes thanks to the blues' cunning.</p>
<p>In the goblin warrens of Brikklext in the Earthspur Mountains , a pair of twin blues, Driklret and Gryxt , were the brains behind the settlement, rather than the bugbear that was the public leader.</p>
