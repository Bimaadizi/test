<p>The Palace of the Moon was a temple to Selûne located in Caer Corwell on the island of Gwynneth in the Moonshae Isles as of that town's destruction at the end of the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Palace was located on the west side of the Court of the Moon , an expansive stone square above the city's port. A balustrade overlooked the water, lined with iron cressets for providing light, and a large staircase lined with statues of old heroes descended to the harbor.</p>
<p>An alabaster statue of Selûne—wearing a veil and with her arms outstretched—sat atop a fountain in the middle of the Court of the Moon in front of the Palace.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Palace was a stone and yellow brick building. The front was a large portico characterized by a long colonnade atop a set of steps, behind which were arched stone windows.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After Corwell was overrun by the fey of Sarifal following the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR , the abandoned Palace and Court crumbled, although they remained mostly intact as of the late 15 th century DR . One of the arms of the Selûne statue had broken off by that time, and the fountain in which she stood was dry.</p>
<p>When the crew of the Sphinx landed in Caer Corwell in the late 1470s DR seeking the Winterglen Claw , they landed at the Court of the Moon. It was here that they were greeted by High Lady Ordalf , Queen of Sarifal, who pretended to be a representative of the Claw. Her powerful presence caused the illusion of the area falling into twilight and the fountain to begin filling and overflowing. She offered them tainted food at a table in the Palace's portico, but only Lord Aldon Kendrick was fool enough to partake.</p>
