<p>The Bay of Mists was the natural harbor around which the city of Neverwinter was located.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Bay was one of the few naturally deep ports along the Sword Coast , and sat at the mouth of the Neverwinter River where it emptied into the Sea of Swords . Thanks to the river's volcanically-warmed waters, the Bay remained ice-free in the winter.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The city of Neverwinter was a prosperous port city largely thanks to the natural advantages of this harbor, where the Docks District sat. The Bay of Mists saw ships coming and going yearround and at all hours.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , the Neverwinter Guard had positioned catapults and ballistae to defend the harbor against attackers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Hoar Frost, 87 DR , the city of Eigersstor —later known as Neverwinter—was founded on the Bay of Mists by settlers from Ruathym to take advantage of it as an ice-free port.</p>
<p>Following the events of the Spellplague in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , chunks of land broke away from the shore to float above the Bay as earthmotes . This was a mild problem relative to what happened at Port Llast , the next harbor up the Sword Coast, which filled with silt. This left the Bay of Mists as an even more important port location, at least until Neverwinter was destroyed during the events of the Ruining in the Year of Knowledge Unearthed, 1451 DR . This cataclysm saw lava make its way down the river to the Bay and resulted in the destruction of the harbor.</p>
<p>The Bay remained choked with the ruins of the old docks—known as the swamped docks —and a new Docks District would not be fully rebuilt for three decades. Efforts to dredge the Bay were ongoing as of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , overseen by Neverwinter's harbormaster, Len-jes .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The warm waters of the Bay made it home to plentiful fish and shellfish . As of the late 15 th century DR, sahuagin had been spotted in the Bay.</p>
