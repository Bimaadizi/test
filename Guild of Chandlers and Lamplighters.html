<p>The Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters was a group of organized, professional candle-makers and lamplighters who operated within the city of Waterdeep . They were a very youthful guild that offered a number of different services to the city and their clientele.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>During the day, members of the guild spent their time maintaining or fixing lamps and producing tallow candles , which they then offered for sale.</p>
<p>At night they used their glow pots and reach poles to light the lamps and lampposts located throughout the city. While they had an official contract with city officials, they also performed this service for the city's nobles and wealthier citizens. Guild lamplighters also offered assistance as guides and torch -bearers for those traversing the city in the evening and night.</p>
<h2>Uniform</h2>
<p>Guild members wore black caps that featured a gold flame on either side. For ceremonial events they wore black tunics adorned with the same flame symbol, encircled in gold.</p>
<h2>Membership</h2>
<p>With the exception of the guildmaster and four adult men, members of the guild were Waterdhavian youths, predominantly boys. As a solitary child with gold was an easy target for criminals and thieves, three of the senior guild members served as protectors and guardians to the young men.</p>
<p>Entrance into the guild required acceptance by the Master of the Flame and cost 5 gp . Guild dues were 3 sp per month.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Guild went on strike in the Year of the Duplicitous Courtier, 1496 DR , which left the city streets dark and dangerous.</p>
