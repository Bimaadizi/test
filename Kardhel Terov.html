<p>Kardhel Terov was a fellthane among the Warlock Knights of Vaasa and an ambitious merchant in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kardhel was a tall human with pale skin, iron-gray hair, and a normally clean-shaven face with a strong jawline. As a result of his forming the pact with Telos that all Warlock Knights took, his eyes were a deep, bloody crimson.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Terov was manipulative and cold. He was always unflappably calm, with an iron will that he used to suppress showing any anger or frustration in his negotiations. He was quick to offer and require that those with whom he made deals swear upon his pact ring, and thus partake in the pact of the iron ring to compel both parties to uphold their end of the bargain.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Among Terov's possessions was his heavy ironfell pact ring carved with dire runes, which he wore on his finger and which was not removable. He also possessed an iron instant fortress that he used as a home base while traveling.</p>
<p>When he though he might be going into danger, Kardhel wore ebon plate mail with a black helm fitted with gilded ram's horns curling from the sides.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Ches of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Terov approached Mhurren of the Bloody Skulls orc tribe, offering the warchief his own kingdom of Thar in exchange for an oath of fealty and an agreement not to endanger cities under Kardhel's protection. Wanting to have a protected trade route from Vaasa to the Moonsea , he provided the chieftain with arms, armaments, monsters, and the loyalty of several other Tharran tribes, which Mhurren then used to sack Glister and then march on Hulburg , where the army was defeated at the Battle of Lendon's Dike in Tarsakh of that year.</p>
<p>Undeterred, he continued to try to bring Hulburg into Vaasa's orbit, first by trying to undermine the city and the Hulmaster family by supporting Valdarsel , a follower of Cyric stoking discontent and violent among the populace in mid-to-late 1479 DR, and then by offering power and protection to the usurper Rhovann Disarnnyl in Alturiak of the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR . However, by Ches of that year, his schemes had been thwarted by Geran Hulmaster , who subdued the Warlock Knight and forced him to swear on his pact ring that neither he nor the rest of his order would try to meddle in Hulburg's affairs for 10 years.</p>
