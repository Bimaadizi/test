<p>Scroll of protection from air was a magical scroll found in Zakhara , the Land of Fate.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Reading this scroll created an area of protection centered around the caster, with a diameter of 10 feet (3 meters). It protected the caster from all air-based spells and effects, as well as mundane wind. It also protected the caster from poisons carried in the wind. However, it offered no protection against poisons that did not travel in the wind. For example, if this scroll was read then the caster moved into a poisonous cloud, the caster was vulnerable to being poisoned. The scroll had no effect on air elemental creatures but protected the caster from their attacks.</p>
