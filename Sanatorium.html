<p>The Sanatorium was an underground institution in Helm's Hold that catered to the care for spellscarred individuals who suffered the more severe ailments brought on by their condition.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It was located beneath the Cathedral of Helm .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The labyrinthine Sanatorium was composed of long, twisting corridors and underground vaults.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The dark and cold feeling of the Sanatorium lent to an atmosphere that more resembled a dungeon or prison, rather than a place of care and convalescence.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>For many years, the Sanatorium offered healing and housing for those spellscarred who suffered from any form of insanity or physical ailments brought upon by the lingering effects of the Spellplague . It was staffed by Helmite priests that dedicated themselves to the care of these unfortunate souls.</p>
<p>When the Prophet Rohini emerged as a leader in Helm's Hold, she championed the cause of offering care for the city's spellscarred. She was aided in her efforts by a trusted goliath named Torlgar , who served as the Sanatorim's warden.</p>
<p>Some patients that were considered relatively healthy aided in the upkeep and maintenance of Helm's cathedral. Every patient was allowed to leave their underground domain once each day and walk the undergrounds under close scrutiny by the priests.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the 1470s DR, the Prophet Rohini began experimenting on the very same people she swore to care for within the Sanatorium, even transforming some into foulspawn abominations. Her atrocities continued when she allowed the Ashmadai to sacrifice the patients in the rituals they used to conjure forth devils from the Nine Hells .</p>
<p>During the Siege of Helm's Hold , circa the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Rohini secluded herself within the Cathedral of Helm and surrounded her Ashmadai cultists and devilish allies. Aided by the creature known as Hexabaal the Seer , the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge ventured into the Sanatorium by means of a secret entrance and slew the warden Torlgar, before breaking through into the cathedral itself confronting Rohini herself.</p>
