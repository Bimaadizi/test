<p>Scurrd was an alleged beverage notorious in Neverwinter in the early 1370s DR . None knew what what was in it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , at a seedy tavern in Neverwinter's Docks District , scurrd might've been offered as the last of a series of drinks in a drinking contest against the half-orc pirate Jalek of the Bloodsailors . He'd pass out after this one bottle, but the challenger would earn his respect.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Scurrd was indescribable. Those who'd tried it struggled to put it in words or even refused to speak of it. Jalek introduced it as "The meanest, foulest, black bile on the earth" and "What is in Scurrd? What, indeed. Scurrd... just seems to find its way... to where it can do the most harm. It's truly vicious. It cannot be smelled by the elderly... It cannot be held by small children... It is Scurrd, and woe be to ye that take it to your tongue." A dwarf called Ulfnog said "If i don't want to drink it, what makes you think I'll sully my mouth discussing it? Scurrd is Scurrd. That's all that should need to be said."</p>
