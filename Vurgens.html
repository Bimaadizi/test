<p>Vurgens , also known as giant gulper eels , were a large marine predator.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The vurgens body was basically a large head and a long tail. Their head supported a massive jaw with a bite radius large enough to swallow even large prey. As they lacked teeth, they did not chew prey. Instead of teeth, they had thick bony plates with held prey in the mouth. They had several rows of sharp spines that grew on either side of its body. The vurgens tail had a cluster of these spines.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Vurgens were extremely territorial. They attacked any large creature within their territory, including krakens and whales , which they perceived as a threat to their claim. Vurgens fought each other over territory in epic battles to the death.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Vurgens attacked prey with a rapid strike, swallowing their target whole. Vurgens used their razor-sharp spines and strong tail as weapons.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Vurgens were obligate carnivores and ate any creature that could fit in their mouth. Once inside, prey was paralyzed by the vurgens saliva and then slowly digested.</p>
<p>Vurgens reproduced every two years. Female vurgens carried the fertilized eggs with her until they hatched. Between twenty to forty vurgens were spawned per mating couple. After hatching, the female vurgens carried the young until they were roughly 1 ft (30 cm) in length. Young vurgens reached adulthood after six years.</p>
<h3>Habitat</h3>
<p>Vurgens lived deep in the ocean, rarely encountered on the surface. While they had no lairs, they used underwater caves to recuperate after being wounded or to give birth.</p>
<p>In the Sea of Fallen Stars , they were known to often be found within the lower depths of Serôs . Beyond Faerûn , vurgens could be found in the waters of Maztica .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Vurgens were greatly feared by ocean dwelling races such as the locathah .</p>
