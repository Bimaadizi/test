<p>Hurim Jaskyr was a healer and priest of Amaunator , who served as the head priest of the Eveningstar War Hospital during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hurim was an older man with short gray hair. He wore a simple gray robe.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar , Hurim Jaskyr supervised the Eveningstar War Hospital as they treated the wounded and sick. He was assisted by fellow healers Meena Follakin , Delethir Mistveil , Eolynn Arva , and Jono Branton .</p>
<p>When the ranger Peron Uthe returned to Eveningstar, he started spreading a disease to the other patients that turned them into red musk zombies , though they themselves could not pass it on. Peron was barricaded into the west wing of the hospital to contain him, and Meena went for help with Anazar. They found a team of adventurers who were brought in, and helped Hurim create an inoculation against Peron's disease by collecting samples from the fallen patients Aeron Leifbrand and Mikhael Jarvin . With a protection devised against the disease, Hurim created a dimension door to the west wing and sent the adventurers though to finish the job, saving the hospital.</p>
<p>Later, several Purple Dragons infected with lycanthropy were brought into the hospital for treatment, without anyone knowing they were afflicted. The first sign of something being wrong was when one of them killed Hurim Jaskyr and tore his body to shreds, leaving him in his bed. The healer Delethir Mistveil invited more adventurers into the locked-down hospital to investigate the bizarre murder, only for the following nightfall to reveal even more werewolves and the pack leader Ogiyon Tomain .</p>
