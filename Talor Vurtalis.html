<p>Talor Vurtalis was an aquatic elf high mage in Myth Nantar in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1341 DR , Talor was accepted as new student by the High Mages Taranath Reefglamor and Yrlimn Tidark , together with Jhanra Merlistar and Keryth Adofaer . In 1346 DR , Taranath placed three selu'kiira upon their brows, sending the students into comas while the gems force-fed the knowledge of millennia into their brains.</p>
<p>Talor and his fellows awakened only on Tarsakh 1 of 1369 DR in order to help in the Twelfth Serôs War . Talor and his fellow helped their masters in the war and in the great spell that sent Iakhovas to the Outer Planes .</p>
<p>After Yrlimn and Taranath died of exhaustion, Keryth and Jhanra replaced them as new High Mages and Talor was nominated High Mage.</p>
<p>In Ches of 1370 DR , Talor summoned a Whirlpool Gate in Myth Nantar , seemingly not caring for the people around him, and disappeared. In Nightal , some dukars discovered him in the Cliff City of Atin . Talor had renamed himself Atin and had taken control of the beast of the city. He injured the dukars that discovered him.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Talor vainly wore his selu'kiira openly on his forehead in opposition to the tradition to hide it. In Myth Nantar, he paid no attention to his students and used his time to explore the city and the area around.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Talor was not confident in his abilities and responsibilities.</p>
