<p>Ixas was one of the Wearers of Purple , a wizard and a traditionalist follower of the Cult of the Dragon in the Moonsea in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>His master remained loyal to the old traditions of the Cult, in opposition to the majority of the Cult that had shifted to Severin Silrajin 's vision. In order to increase the power of his faction, in the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR he sought the power hidden in a village on a small isle near Phlan . He had his kobold minions attack the village, but they were defeated by an adventuring party hired to investigate rumors of dracoliches and ghost ships wandering the area, as well as the villagers, who had mastered fiendish powers.</p>
<p>Soon after, Ixas' ship was attacked both by the adventurers and fiendish pirates accidentally released by the adventurers. In the battle, Ixas and his crew were presumably killed.</p>
