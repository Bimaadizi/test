<p>Vampire bats and their giant vampire bat cousins were species of flying living creatures that fed on mammalian blood, unlike their fruit and insect feeding relatives. Vampire bats were often associated with lycanthropes and vampires .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like other bats , vampire bats relied on echolocation rather than sight when flying and hunting in the night skies. Echolocation was a type of auditory radar sense what was achieved by bats screeching and receiving echoes of the sound bouncing off objects and obstacles. Because of reliance of hearing, vampire bats had a weak eyesight which made them virtually immune to spells and abilities that blinded the targets or affected them via light. However spells such as silence effectively crippled and "blinded" vampire bats.</p>
<p>Giant vampire bats' bites had a chance of rendering their targets unconscious for 1-10 minutes, allowing the creature to feed freely. Even though giant vampire bats were not undead themselves, the victims who perished from being drained by them had a chance of raising as undead 24 hours after their death.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Most vampire bats fed exclusively on non-humanoid mammalian blood, however, oftentimes their presence fueled panic and paranoia in fear of true vampires.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Werebats could take on a form of a vampire bat or a hybrid of a humanoid and a vampire bat. Vampires had affinity for vampire bats, they were able to summon individual and swarms of creatures that included vampire bats and bats often could be found within their lairs.</p>
<p>Occasionally, wizards were able to use vampire bats as familiars . The vampire lord Cazador Sharr was able to summon swarms of vampire bats by using the spell vampiric swarm .</p>
<p>Some sages speculated that stirges were closely related to vampire bats due to both species sleeping while hanging upside down. Furthermore, exceptionally large species of stripes were known to inhabit dense tropical jungles and they often intermingled with giant vampire bats.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Vampire bats were often spotted in the night skies over Waterdeep and in the vicinity of the Dragon Tower of the wizard Maaril in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<p>Outside of Toril , vampire bats could be found in the land of Barovia in the Domains of Dread .</p>
