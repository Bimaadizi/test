<p>The Gorath was the hidden leader of the Royal Vagabonds of Shou Lung around 1357 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Gorath secretly assisted the Old Man in managing the activities of the Royal Vagabonds against enemies of Shou Lung. In truth, Gorath was for centuries in the service of the Chin dynasty , a task assigned to him by the Undersecretary of the Minister of War in the Celestial Bureaucracy and he did not always work for the good of the Empire.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>The Gorath had encountered Lui-hsia Chih of the Many-Hued Peacock Society several times in the past and they were mortal enemies.</p>
<p>Sometimes he appeared to direct the Royal Vagabonds cell in Nakamaru in Wa , where he correctly presumed that Lui-hsia Chih was hidden.</p>
