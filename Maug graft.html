<p>Maug grafts were special grafts created for the purpose of augmenting maug warriors. While intended for constructs , it was possible to attach them onto other creatures as well.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Generally, they were crafted from metal or the stone of Thuldanin , the second layer of the plane of Acheron . Once attached, maug grafts did not radiate magic , and they could generally not be reused if removed.</p>
<h3>Creation</h3>
<p>Only maugs understood how such grafts were created, and in particular they were applied by maug spellcasters, such as the ancient Thulkarr . Transforming a creature using maug grafts required experience as a healer, specialized knowledge of how to attach grafts, and often access to one or more relevant spells . The grafts could be sized for even very tiny and very massive recipients.</p>
<h2>Users</h2>
<p>New maugs received a simple graft upon their creation—such as a locking hand, shoving arm, or stone spitter—and experienced maug mercenaries would use their amassed treasure to pay for additional upgrades. Maug spellcasters also devised ways to augment creatures of flesh with these grafts, although they reserved such transformations for their followers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1375 DR , two maug fighters sporting shoving arm grafts served the Zhentarim as guardians at Castle Krag in Shadowdale .</p>
