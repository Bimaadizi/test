<p>Yunik al-Zanil ran a small shop specializing in flying tours within the Grand Bazaar of Huzuz in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Yunikâ€™s rates were pricey, but worth it. For 20 dinars customers received a 30 minute aerial tour of Golden Huzuz aboad a flying carpet . The tours were customized based upon what the customer wished to view.</p>
<p>Yunik had several apprentices who paid for their training by taking customers on tours, though Yunik stepped in to conduct tours for elite customers.</p>
<p>Flying above the Golden Mosque or the Palace of the Enlightened Throne was prohibited.</p>
<p>Customers who had the permission of the Grand Vizier or Grand Caliph were allowed to purchase flying carpets from Yunik. Large carpets sold for 10,000 dinar, and smaller ones for 5,000. The waiting time to receive a carpet was six months. If customers were not willing to wait that long, Yunik sometimes sold the carpets he used on tours.</p>
