<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bespectacled and clad in blue robes, Haroistem sported a thin mane of white hair.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>

<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Haroistem's phylactery of faithfulness was granted to him by Lathander himself, delivered to the priest by a perfect peacock on a scarlet dawn. The phylactery allowed Haroistem to determine if an action was beneficial or not in regard to his standing with Lathander, but also conveyed a constant spell of augury on the priest, allowing him even greater insight into the consequences of his actions.</p>
<p>Aside from this, Haroistem carried several other magical items: a vial of Keoghtom's ointment , some dust of illusion , as well as a lens of detection .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Once a gold-clad morninglord , Haroistem opted to pursue more scholarly ways of serving Lathander as he approached retirement. He spent his days documenting the activities of other high-ranking clerics of Lathander.</p>
