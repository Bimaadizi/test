<p>Branwyn Moonsinger was a Great Druid of the Moonshae Isles during the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As Great Druid, she worked tirelessly to prepare for what she believed to be the inevitable return of Kazgaroth . She made her home in a cottage within the fey realm of Sarifal on the isle of Gwynneth , where she kept watch over the Moonwell in the Sacred Grove of the Earthmother on the eastern shore of the Myrloch .</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, adventurers were known to seek out her assistance.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She was the granddaughter of the late High Queen Alicia Kendrick of the Moonshaes.</p>
<p>Despite residing within Sarifal, she had little contact with the fey of that realm. When she did, it was during rare visits when curious fey brought her gifts in hopes of asking her questions about Gwynneth from before their arrival in the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Born in the Year of the Solitary Cloister, 1408 DR , Branwyn Moonsinger assumed the mantle of Great Druid in the Year of Azuth's Woe, 1440 DR . In the decades that followed, she focused on preparing for Kazgoroth's return. After she declined to intervene when fighting erupted between the humans and fey of Gwynneth, the humans of the Moonshaes assumed she had been killed, leading them to anoint a new Great Druid in her stead. She continued her vigil, but by 1479 DR —at age 71—her years had caught up with her as she had taken no steps to extend her lifespan.</p>
