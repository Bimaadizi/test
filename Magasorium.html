<h2>Description</h2>

When crushed, leaves of magasorium plants released juice that could be used as an effective insect repellent . A single plant could be used to create six doses of this repellent. A single topical application lasted for around four hours; however, it could be washed off or diluted with excessive sweating. Burning the plant was also an effective way of keeping jungle insects at bay.</p>
