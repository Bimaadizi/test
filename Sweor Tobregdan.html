<p>Sweor Tobregdan was the second mate of the hammership , the Probe .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>As second mate, Sweor served directly below Aelfred Silverhorn in the hierarchy of command and was a good friend of his.</p>
<p>Along with Aelfred and the elven mage Vallus Leafbower , Sweor was one of the only three crewmembers of the Probe with whom Teldin Moore —future Cloakmaster—felt comfortable carrying on a long conversation.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Formerly a mercenary, Sweor joined the crew of the Probe to escape execution or assassination.</p>
<p>On the journey from Krynn to Toril , while in the flow , the Probe was attacked by a neogi deathspider . Before the battle, Aelfred assigned Sweor to lead the defense of the hammership's aftcastle. After taking heavy damage from projectiles, the hammership was crippled, grappled, and boarded. As slaves poured onto the deck, Sweor recklessly leapt from the aftcastle ladder into the horde, easily dispatching four of the invading humans quickly with his blade. His success in battle was not to last to the end, however; as the Probe finally freed itself from the deathspider's grappling arms, the other crewmembers found Sweor coughing up blood in his last gasps of life.</p>
