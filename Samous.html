<p>Samous , whose self-proclaimed nickname was the Rapturious Songster , was a maestro inhabiting the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands during the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Samous was famous for buying a large plot of land in Daggerford and designing and erecting a monstrous building called the Grand Playhouse . The Grand Playhouse was located in central Daggerford along Duke's Way , the High Road , and the Farmer's Road . Samous' goal with the massive theater was to bring high culture to Daggerford by hiring skilled actors and singers from great cities such as Waterdeep . However, the citizenry of Daggerford showed little interested in such forms of entertainment and Samous was quickly forced to close the doors to the Grand Playhouse. He left the city a penniless man shortly thereafter.</p>
