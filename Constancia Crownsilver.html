<p>Constancia Crownsilver was a knight of Torm and a member of the noble Crownsilver family of Cormyr .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After Aubrin Crownsilver 's father was assassinated, Constancia was assigned to look after him, her second cousin. Constancia and Brin were placed in the same Tormite monastery where Constancia apparently flourished though Brin was unhappy. In the Year of the Purloined Statue, 1477 DR , Brin ran away from the monastery to the Sword Coast . Although Constancia chased after Brin in an attempt to bring him back, she was charged by the Tormites with dereliction of duty because it was her responsibility to keep Brin safe.</p>
<p>Constancia was eventually caught by a trio of bounty hunters led by the dragonborn Mehen and was returned to Cormyr in the Year of the Dark Circle, 1478 DR .</p>
