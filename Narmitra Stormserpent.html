<p>Narmitra Stormserpent was a noble in Cormyr and a lady of the Stormserpent noble house in the mid-to-late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was too old for the vampire archmage Manshoon 's tastes; given her son Marlin was extremely unlikely to be under 50 years old and wasn't even the oldest son, she was almost certainly 65 years old or more.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>There was nothing about the nobility of Suzail that Narmitra liked.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Narmitra was the mother of Marlin Stormserpent , Nethglas Stormserpent , Rondras Stormserpent , and Elgrym Stormserpent . Mhedarlakh Stormserpent was her brother-in-law. Marlin suspected his mother liked him the best of all his siblings, and was more than a little afraid of her; they sparred verbally with regularity.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the death of her husband, Narmitra Stormserpent had Mhedarlakh Stormserpent take the place of head of the House, though she continued to wield the real power in the family; she did so to spare her son Marlin the unenviable tasks of the Head. At some point, Marlin got her promise she wouldn't go into certain towers of Stormserpent Towers . She did go in anyway for a time, but observed nothing of interest in there.</p>
<p>Narmitra Stormserpent was at Stormserpent Towers during the attack by Immaero Sraunter and Manshoon , in which they filled the towers with deadly gas to kill all possible witnesses of their treasons involving her son Marlin, as there were War Wizards trying to gain entry by force; unaware of the attack, she threatened her servants with all sorts of barbaric fates if a single agent of the Crown got in. Though Manshoon believed she was sure to perish, she survived the attempt, rescued by the War Wizards. She was then taken to Castle Obarskyr for questioning.</p>
