<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kirath had long blonde hair, blue eyes, and bushy eyebrows. He was vain, and considered himself the greatest wizard of the Realms . Despite his arrogance, he was seemingly very powerful, making it down to the lower reaches of Xanathar's outer sanctum alone.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>All of Kirath's equipment was enchanted. He wore +2 bracers of defense , a +2 ring of protection , and a +5 robe of protection . The bold mage also owned the incredibly powerful and unique dagger known as Flicka .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1358 DR, Kirath ventured down below Waterdeep , seeking the great magics of Xanathar. When resurrected, he scoffed at the adventurers who brought back his remains. The conceited mage commented that the party probably thought he owed them. The half-elf, however, cared nothing for their commission from the Lords of Waterdeep , but as they were heading down the same path, he offered to join them.</p>
