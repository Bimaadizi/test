<p>Spiel was a Netherese enclave and a center of learning.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Founded in −2510 DR (1349 NY), it grew to house many universities and other institutions of learning, so much so that ten years after its founding there were more schools than taverns or festhalls. Where Selûnarra was known for its plays and being the center of Netherese culture, Spiel focused on Netherese folklore and the history of the dwarves and elves . In addition, it paid particular attention to studying military history, tactics, and strategy.</p>
<p>When Karsus caused the fall of the enclaves, Spiel suddenly crashed down into the Eastern Forest , leaving its inhabitants with no time to react. It seems that the shattered ruins of Spiel remain undiscovered to this day.</p>
