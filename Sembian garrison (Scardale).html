<p>The Sembian garrison was a fortification in Scardale Town established by the government of Sembia during the occupation of Scardale in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personnel</h2>
<p>As of 1367 DR , the garrison was led by commander Rhellan Trollgrip , who in turn worked under the orders of the influential merchant Lady Sashesh . Through bribery and other means, the agents of Sembia compromised the garrisons of Harrowdale and Tasseldale , supplementing their martial forces with mercenaries loyal to the merchant nation.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the second inter-dale war , the merchants of Sembia sought to gain influence over the other coalition powers that kept Scardale's power in check, and turn its capital into a Sembian city. This endeavor was led by Lady Sasheh herself, acting as a liaison for her colleagues to the south. By pouring money into the war-torn dale, they managed to build a number of new businesses and dominate the local trade in the region. The Sembian district of Scardale recovered most rapidly from the war and flourished where others still struggled.</p>
<p>When the Shaking Plague devastated Scardale Town in 1370 DR , the Sembian garrison was hit especially hard. The timing was particularly suspicious as it occurred when Sembia was exceedingly confident in their power, having outlasted, bribed, or otherwise marginalized the other garrisons, save for the Zhentish one. Following the initial outbreak of the disease, the garrison had only three survivors.</p>
