<p>Shadelorn was a Netherese archwizard who lived during the Shadowed Age .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The eager Shadelorn inhabited Shadowtop Borough , a enclave that held a friendly community of arcanists and archwizards. Shadelorn achieved much during his life, and even accomplished feats that several other archwizards were unable to achieve. In 3215 NY (−644 DR) , he finally rediscovered the Crown of Horns , after others had spent centuries searching for it. Shadelorn even trumped Ioulaum by discovering the key to producing powerful mythallars in 3517 NY (−342 DR) . Unfortunately, Shadelorn's success would not continue due to the evil work of the Crown of Horns . When he activated his enhanced mythallar, the sentient crown altered it, causing the entire enclave to plummet into the Janick River .</p>
