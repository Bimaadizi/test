<p>Lunit Bdufe was a healer of the Roadwarden Guard , stationed in the Skull Crag Keep in the Storm Horn Mountains of Cormyr in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lunit Bdufe wore clothes adorned with the symbol of the Roadwarden Guard. She was a tall and slender woman.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the early 1360s DR , Sir Dutiocs , the Chief of the Roadwarden Guard, and the Roadwarden Arelin Starbrow were ambushed by a horde of monsters. Arelin was slain while Dutiocs escaped with his life and the Roadwarden's body. Hurt and tired, Sir Dutiocs took a stand against the monsters by Skull Crag's gates, joined by a band of caravan guards who happened to be there. After the battle, Lunit Bdufe and several other members of the Roadwarden Guard galloped down the hill from the Skull Crag Keep. Lunit's healing was wasted on the dead hero, but she rejuvenated Sir Dutiocs with a single touch on his forehead. She informed Dutiocs that Morudel was waiting to be decreed the Chief of the Roadwarden Guard after the tragedy and accompanied Dutiocs back to the Skull Crag Keep.</p>
<p>Back at the Chapel of Sune in the Skull Crag Keep, Lunit Bdufe offered training and tutoring services to clerics and priests .</p>
<p>Later, after the true villains revealed themselves, Lunit Bdufe rushed to the Skull Crag Keep after hearing the sounds of battle. She arrived after the struggle was over, and Vidruand Starbrow , now a vampire , was defeated. She offered to heal the survivors, including the adventurers, Sir Dutiocs, and the three living Starbrow siblings. However, the true challenge was still to come. The Keep's ancient masters Khulzond and Mordroka revealed themselves, magically restraining the defenders of the Keep. With a single arcane word, Mordroka returned Vidruand to the bodily undead form and commanded with magic the Arms of the Roadwarden to fly towards the undead Starbrow. With the last of her divine magics, Lunit Bdufe dispelled paralyzing magics that restrained the heroes and pulled the Arms of the Roadwarden from villains before collapsing in exhaustion.</p>
