<p>Lashan Aumersair was the ruler of Scardale until he attempted a war of conquest in the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR , to unite the Dalelands under his rule.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A direct descendant of Elminster (the Aumersair name was a corruption of "Aumar's heir"), Lashan was descended from a long line of Purple Dragons and Harpers . After his defeat in 1356, he ventured into the ruins of Myth Drannor where he fell in battle against the lich Azimer , who transformed him into a Larva and imprisoned him beneath the earth.
Sometime later, a night hag in service of Shar freed him, and when the Sharran decided to conquer Shadowdale in the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR , Shar elevated Lashan to a nycaloth to use him in the conquest.</p>
