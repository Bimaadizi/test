<p>Ephemerals , also called ephemeras , were a class of outsider native to the Plane of Shadow . It was a diverse group of creatures in form and abilities, with few traits in common beyond their origin and composition.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ephemerals had no unifying form beyond the fact that all were partially or wholly composed of shadowstuff .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Both dusk beasts and ecalypses were generally neutral in outlook, while umbral banyans were predatory and vicious enough to typically be evil.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Ephemerals were native to the Plane of Shadow , but were often found on the Material plane as well, either from slipping through open portals or from being deliberately brought over as guards, mounts, or hunters.</p>
<h3>Varieties</h3>
<p>Known varieties of ephemerals were:</p>
<p>Additionally, it was possible that the ephemeral hangman was yet another type of ephemeral.</p>
<h2>Notable Ephemerals</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , a dusk beast named Grask served as companion to the shadar-kai Sithierel on the Necreme as they plied the Shadow Swamp in the Plane of Shadow. It was presumably destroyed by adventurers in service to Mystra in early Eleint . There was also a chance that dusk beasts were living wild in the swamp.</p>
