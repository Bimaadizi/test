<p>Maimun was a bard and renowned pirate who sailed up and down the entirety of the Sword Coast in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . [ citation needed ]</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time around 1344 DR , as a baby, Maimun's village was destroyed by raiders working for the cambion named Asbeel , who was obsessed with finding both the Stone of Tymora and the mortal whom the stone had chosen as its wielder. Maimun was that mortal. [ citation needed ]</p>
<p>His mother hid him in the wine cellar of the family home before it was set alight. Though a beam of the burning ceiling fell, it missed the babe by an extremely narrow margin and its flames kept him warm through the night. The next day, he was rescued from the ruins by a mysterious rider and taken to live with the druidess Elbeth of the High Forest in her grove. Elbeth named him only Lucky Child .</p>
<p>Exactly six years after that event, which the two celebrated as his birthday, Asbeel found the two of them and demanded Elbeth surrender the child, though of course she refused. Not wanting to face Elbeth in her grove, he set fire to the surrounding trees, drawing her out. Elbeth hid the boy in the boughs of a pine tree and told him to follow the road at dawn. He was woken by a man with whom he fled the forest.</p>
<p>The man was called Perrault and was the same mysterious rider who had taken him from the ruins of his first home. With him not having a proper name, Perrault named him 'Maimun', the Bedine word for 'twice lucky' since he had been rescued twice.</p>
<p>Perrault and Maimun traveled along much of the northern and southern Sword Coast for the next six years, never venturing inside a settlement larger than Nesmé , nor between Waterdeep and Tethyr . Maimun was taught to read and learned of much lore in that time thanks to the many books Perrault carried with him. Then, one day Perrault told him to research Baldur's Gate . A few days after Maimun's twelfth birthday, the pair arrived and snuck in over the wall once night had fallen.</p>
<p>Maimun later joined Captain Deudermont 's crew in the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR .</p>
