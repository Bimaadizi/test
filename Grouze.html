<p>Grouze was a goblin from the ruined mines of Dekanter , that was further transformed into a mongrelman by the undead mind flayer known across the North as the Beast Lord .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Grouze was once a warrior within his goblin community, before he was abducted by the Beast Lord and transformed into what his fellow tribe members referred to as a "demon". He was killed by a group of travelers that delved into Dekanter in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR .</p>
<p>Despite the monstrous form he was given, Grouze was still recognizable by scars he retained from his goblinoid life. After his death, none of Grouze's former tribe members would touch his body nor any of his belongings, for fear they would suffer from the same affliction that warped his body. Grouze's killers brought his body to the goblin chieftain Ghistpok , determined to stop the atrocities against nature committed by the Beast Lord.</p>
