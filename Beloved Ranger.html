<p>The Beloved Ranger was a large statue located in Baldur's Gate that portrayed a larger-than-life depiction of the Rashemi ranger Minsc and his companion Boo . It was the the only structure allowed to permanently grace the ever-bustling marketplace of the Upper City , and was a particular favorite meeting spot that was rather cherished by the Baldurian populace.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The sculpture depicted the peculiar hero of the city with his distinct smile as he held his " giant pygmy space hamster " with care.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Each morning before dawn, the Bailiff of the Wide and their subordinates gathered around the statue to discuss changes in market-stall locations and prepare for the activities of the day.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Beloved Ranger was erected sometime around the Year of the Dauntless Dwarves, 1412 DR and commissioned by Orburt Lewel , a rather eccentric merchant. This honorific deed was taken as a sort of thanks, as apparently Minsc had saved Lewel's life from some long-forgotten peril. Unbeknownst to anyone at the time, the statue was actually the real Minsc and Boo under the effects of petrification .</p>
<p>In 1482 DR , a group of teenagers vandalized the statue, breaking off its hands and Boo. The vandals were later apprehended and the statue was fixed.</p>
<p>One night, in the 1480s DR , the wild mage Delina was being chased through the Upper City by a pair of gargoyles . She stopped running in the Wide and stood her ground at the foot of the Beloved Ranger. When she cast a spell , the errant effects of the wild magic struck the statue and dispelled the petrification, bringing Minsc and Boo back to life.</p>
<p>The merchants of the Wide complained vehemently about the loss of some of the marketplace's charm, so by the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR a new statue was commissioned and placed on the same pedestal where the originals once stood.</p>
