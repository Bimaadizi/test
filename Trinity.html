<p>Trinity was a long-lived Netherese community on Hidden Lake devoted to the worship of Amaunator .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The city sat on the southeastern shores of the lake at the mouth of the Cede River . Behind it, the Hidden Forest rose up into the Shinantra Mountains , the source of the Cede River. Northwards lay Dahla River City , and to the east was Algid .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Trinity largely kept to fishing and light farming, with large numbers of religious pilgrims of Jannath also passing through on the way up the Cede River to the Cede Pool holy site.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The settlement was founded in 1244 NY (−2615 DR) by members of three different Amaunatori groups that had escaped persecution by Sharrans . They spent the first year discussing theological matters, ultimately discarding their differences and focusing on what united them. Together, they built a new and unique religious sect, one that did not particularly care for the hierarchical, strict, and legalistic bureaucracy that tended to dominate Amaunatori societies. Instead, they focused more on social cohesion and conscientiousness as virtues, making it by far the most relaxed and friendly Amaunatori city in Netheril.</p>
<p>Netheril's Golden Age ( −2207 DR to −1206 DR ) saw the city flooded with Jannathan pilgrims passing through to the nearby Cede Pool . The unorthodox and friendly locals were more than happy to welcome the travelers, and earned quite a bit of coin from them to. Following General Matick 's Last Stand at Humaithira in 2298 NY (−1561 DR) , the invading giants of Thane Blóta passed into the Hidden Lake region. Though he had died at Humaithira , Matick's sacrifice won time for reinforcements to gather, and the giants were finally defeated near Trinity.</p>
<p>Trinity experienced quiet prosperity during the Age of Discovery ( −1205 DR to −697 DR ). Some decent ore deposits in the Shinantra Mountains were discovered, but were never exploited, and expeditions to find and identify strange, hairy creatures lurking in the highlands produced nothing. Trinity instead found glory in the construction of a great temple to Amaunator in 3022 NY (−837 DR) , the Temple of Time .</p>
<p>The Shadowed Age, from 3163 NY (−696 DR) , brought omens and portents upon the priests of the Temple of Time. Each potentate experienced dreams of fires, storms, and darkness, with no apparent cause or solution. Although nearby Algid was destroyed by phaerimms in 3374 NY (−485 DR) , the people of Trinity trusted in the safety of their city, even as the dreams of oncoming doom spread to the wider population. The Temple of Time suddenly began shining brightly with reflected sunlight in 3420 NY (−439 DR) , and though it blinded passersby it served as a glorious beacon for Amaunator visible from miles away.</p>
<p>Karsus's Folly occurred 100 years later in 3520 NY (−339 DR) , and the Temple ended its divine glow. The sun was occluded by an eclipse and the sky filled with thunder and lightning, and within only a few hours the entire population of Trinity abandoned the city under the cover of darkness and evacuated towards the south.</p>
