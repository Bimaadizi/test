<p>Dwarfbane was a poison that was especially effective against dwarves .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Dwarfbane was gummy in its consistency. It did not dry out but it did lose its potency after approximately thirty days.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>The duergar of the Underdark often coated darts and other weapons with this poison for the use in traps.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Though the duergar were completely immune to the poison, dwarfbane was lethal to all other dwarves.</p>
<p>Dwafbane was one of sixteen formulas for poisons recorded in the book known as The Nathlum . It was thought that the formulas were originally written down by the mage , Lethchauntos the Black , during his time spent with an orc tribe. Some of these same formulas were copied from the book by the mage, Phrandjas of Port Llast and sold to local alchemists .</p>
