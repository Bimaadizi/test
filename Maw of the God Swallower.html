<p>The Maw of the God Swallower was an oblong-shaped region of utter annihilation in southern Chessenta in the late 15th century DR .</p>
<p>Along the edges, the ground crumbled away and the sky was dark. In the interior of the region, the land fell away into a void and the primordial Entropy hung in the exact center of the void.</p>
