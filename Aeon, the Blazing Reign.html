<p>Aeon, the Blazing Reign was a powerful longbow found in the ruins of Myth Drannor in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Aeon was linked to the dracolich Karliath , and heralded what was hoped to be a long and fiery tyranny. It landed arrows rapidly and with devastating force, sometimes setting targets alight with unnatural fire.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The bow originated from the Cult of the Dragon when they ritually reanimated Karliath at a hidden base in the ruins, later seized by the Red Wizards of Droic Orgul . The bow may have then found a new handler among the Cormanthor Elves sent by Phathroi .</p>
