<p>A staff of fire was a magical staff that granted its wielder a number of flame-related, spell -like abilities.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The wielder of this staff was resistant to fire while it was in their hands.</p>
<p>A fully charged staff possessed ten charges. Its wielder could cast either burning hands , fireball , or wall of fire from the staff, expending either one, three, or four charges respectively. Each morning at dawn the staff would regain a number of charges. However, if ever all the charges were expended, there was a small chance the staff would disintegrate into a pile of ash and cinders.</p>
