<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR Zimrilin led a group of remaining followers of Gilgeam in a plot to resurect their god thanks to the help of a thief named Kehrsyn posing as Massedar, merchant prince of Wing's Reach in Messemprar devoted to Bane , and gaining the help of a group of Zhentarim . Zimrilim used the Alabaster Staff to raise the preserved body of Gilgeam in order to try to use the undead god as a puppet to rule Unther.</p>
<p>With the help of the Harper agent Demok , Kehrsyn was able to steal back the Alabaster Staff from Zimrilim by exchanging it with a replica made by the Red Wizard Eileph . Kehrsyn later used the Alabaster Staff to destroy the reanimated Gilgeam, with the help of the Tiamatan priestess Tiglath .</p>
<p>Zimrilin and his priests were soon killed by the Church of Tiamat and their allies.</p>
