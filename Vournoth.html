<p>Vournoth was a lich that laired in a stagnant intersection in the Deep Wastes that became known as Vournoth's Mire .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Vournoth had become well-known enough in the vicinity of Maerimydra that the lich 's name was attributed to the mire it resided in.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The powers and abilities of a lich , like Vournoth, meant the creature was highly resistant to ordinary attacks and could paralyze foes with but a touch. Vournoth was considered dangerous enough by the drow of Maerimydra that they sent a champion out to face the lich.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>A notable lich, Vournoth at one time had a phylactery that allowed the lich to reform after defeat.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point, Vournoth managed to master the necromantic art of lichdom and took up residence in a mire roughly 40 miles (64.3 km) from the drow city of Maerimydra in the Deep Wastes . Although many creatures had laired in the mire over the years, Vournoth's reputation eventually spread to such a degree that the fetid intersection became known as Vournoth's Mire .</p>
<p>However, in 800 DR , the expansion of Maerimydra's influence in the wake of the Weeping War , coupled with the threat of a lich so close to their city, prompted the drow to send a champion to hunt down Vournoth. The drow champion managed to drive the lich from its lair and paved the way for the founding of Szith Morcane in 804 DR , and the lair itself was turned into an outpost.</p>
<p>By 1372 DR , Vournoth's reputation had diminished to the point that the mire was simply known as "Lich's Mire" among the Maerimydran drow.</p>
