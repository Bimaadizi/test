<p>Murdane was a deceased lesser deity of pragmatism and reason.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Images of the goddess showed her with a long ponytail of rich reddish-black hair.</p>
<h2>Symbol</h2>
<p>Murdane's holy symbol was a collection of three gears with interlocked teeth, viewed side-on and colored black over a golden field. The uppermost wheel was largest, the middle wheel was medium-sized, and the bottom wheel was smallest, forming an overall chevron-like shape.</p>
<p>In addition, a lock of hair of the same red-black hue was commonly used as a touchstone or keepsake for worship of Murdane or as an aid when working on a problem.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She was the lover of Helm the Watcher, god of guardians.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the divine event known as the Dawn Cataclysm , Lathander the Morninglord set into motion events that indirectly led to the death of Murdane. Murdane was drowned in the watery embrace of Umberlee , Queen of the Depths.</p>
<p>This event was linked to the destruction of the empire of Jhaamdath beneath an enormous tsunami in the Year of Furious Waves, â€“255 DR . However, cause and effect were unclear; whether Jhaamdath's flooding led to or was caused by Murdane's drowning was unknown.</p>
<p>This caused Helm the Vigilant One to view Lathander with ill will thereafter.</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Even as late as the 15 th century DR , some sages still venerated Murdane, considering her the greatest practitioner of logic and deduction, able to learn everything about a person from the minutest clues.</p>
