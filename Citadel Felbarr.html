<p>Citadel Felbarr in the Silver Marches was originally a dwarven citadel of over 25,000 dwarves that at different times in history had belonged to dwarves , humans , orcs , and, since 1367 DR , once again the dwarves.</p>
<h2>Symbol</h2>
<p>The badge of office for the King of Citadel Felbarr was a simple golden crown adorned with three large sapphires .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Citadel Felbarr was located at the base of the Rauvin Mountains along the River Redrun , with Silverymoon Pass to the south and Sundabar Vale to the east. A trade route connected Felbarr to Sundabar to the southeast and Beorunna's Well to the northwest beyond the Cold Wood . The Citadel sat about as far up the River Redrun as was navigable, meaning that the citadel was connected by river all the way down through the River Dessarin .</p>
<p>Citadel Felbarr had tunnels in the upper Upperdark that connected it to Mithral Hall in the west.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early History</h3>
<p>Originally a part of Delzoun , Citadel Felbarr was completed in −1900 DR .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Delighted Dwarves , three dwarf clans hailing from Ammarindar and Citadel Felbarr migrated to Myth Drannor .</p>
<p>In around 1054 DR , the dwarves abandoned Citadel Felbarr. The humans of Silverymoon quickly took advantage of this massive citadel and garrisoned it with over 3,000 troops. They hoped to use it as a base from which to scout the Coldwood and Ice Mountains in order to find timber , gold , and silver , but almost immediately found themselves skirmishing with orcs.</p>
<p>After the Battle of Many Arrows in 1104 DR , which lasted many months, the citadel was captured by orcs and renamed the Citadel of Many Arrows .</p>
<h3>14 th Century</h3>
<p>In the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , Citadel Felbarr was recaptured by a force of dwarves led by Emerus Warcrown , alongside a contingent of soldiers from Silverymoon, when King Obould 's forces were exhausted after battling for four months against another orc tribe led by King Greneire .</p>
<h3>15 th Century</h3>
<p>Emerus Warcrown was still king as of 1479 DR .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Nether Mountain Scrolls, 1486 DR , King Emerus Warcrown abdicated his throne and title to join Bruenor Battlehammer on the march to reclaim Gauntlgrym . The king was replaced by Parson Glaive .</p>
<p>Some time after, the throne was given over to the royal couple King Morinn and Queen Tithmel , a pair of wise monarchs who made it a point to rule as equals. Together, they gave their support to a group of adventurers to deal with the fire giant threat in the old forge of Ironslag , led by the fire giant ruler, Duke Zalto and his family, after the removal of the Ordning . In return for their efforts fighting the giants, the monarchs of Citadel Felbarr offered to build the adventurers a fortified tower somewhere in the Silver Marches, as well as supply the tower with ten Felbarren dwarf guards.</p>
