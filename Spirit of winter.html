<p>A spirit of winter was a fey creature embodying the season of winter.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Thickly muscled and covered in white fur, a spirit of winter exuded a thick mist that seemed to congeal the very air around it into heavy frost. Its roars very reminiscient of a raging blizzard.</p>
<p>Although a spirit of winter did not communicate verbally—beyond its furious roaring, at any rate—it was capable of telepathy .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As a being of pure winter, a spirit of winter could fire various blasts of cold energy at opponents.</p>
<p>A spirit of winter could be magically bound to a "frost gem" to harness its wintry power for some purpose, in which case the spirit would be encased within the gem until approached by a credible threat. The spirit would then manifest and defend the gem, and both the gem and the spirit would be damaged concurrently if either were attacked.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>In addition to its frosty blasts, a spirit of winter was partial to slamming its opponents with its fists. If damaged sufficiently, it would fire off even more cold blasts. A defeated spirit of winter would howl in agony before collapsing in on itself in a white, misty cloud.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A spirit of winter was bound to a sapphire by the fey of the Dire Wood to encase the tower of the warlock Draigdurroch in ice. This was done because they feared his research into the latent divine energy left behind by the Netherese arcanist -turned-failed-god Karsus . Unforunately, the cold energy emanating from the spirit of winter drew a group of ice warriors from the Elemental Chaos , who started fiddling with the ritual and expanding its strength and range of influence manyfold.</p>
