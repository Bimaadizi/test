<h2>Personality</h2>

<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Jarthon was spartanly equipped, usually with only his mithral chain shirt , magic longsword , dagger , and crossbow (albeit with a few silver -tipped bolts ) for protection.</p>
<p>However, Jarthon had amassed a small stash of gold , gems , and a couple of potions of cure moderate wounds back in Claw Hollow .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jarthon Drael was once a half-elf from Silverymoon who used his skills to hunt down lycanthropes from the People of the Black Blood in the Moonwood, hoping he could protect the people of his city from them. However, on one of his hunts, he was bitten during a werebadger attack and eventually contracted lycanthropy , becoming the very thing he hunted.</p>
<p>Rising to leadership of the Moonwood tribe and based at the refuge of Claw Hollow, Jarthon became a barb in the flank of the people of the Silver Marches . In 1372 DR , he led his tribe in a campaign against the people of Quaervarr , abducting a woodcutter during one of Jarthon's monthly High Hunts in the month of Kythorn . When the woodcutter's body was found it had a pinned note from Jarthon warning the town to cease expanding into his territory.</p>
