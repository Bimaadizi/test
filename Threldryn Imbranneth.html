<p>Threldryn Imbranneth was a knight and a noble of Cormyr who rode with Princess Alusair Obarskyr .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Alusair and her knights were operating in the Stonelands , pursuing a bold orc band that had raided a caravan east of Eveningstar ; in six days of pursuit, they'd killed a hydra , a " fire lizard ", and three chimeras . Beldred Truesilver sent Threldryn and Brace Skatterhawk to watch Alusair when she stepped aside to receive a private message. They returned to find Beldred and the knights had impetuously pursued the orcs into an ambush, and a few were killed. Alusair rallied her forces to defeat the orcs, before deducing they served a dark naga and the Zhentarim , who had been charming and transporting monsters into the area; Threldryn struggled to catch up to her reasoning. He was one of those who volunteered to aid Alusair, and had a hand in slaying the naga.</p>
