<h2>History</h2>
<p>Flamdar was part of the Bloodshields Band when it ventured into Shadowdale in 1479 DR , on commission from a rich Sembian who had paid a large amount upfront, looking for Elminster Aumar , the ancient archmage. They came first upon the Old Skull Inn , where Gaerond commissioned the youngster Thal , actually a doppelganger , to lead him to Elminster. Thal took them to a cave, where they met a doppelganger pretending to be Elminster; when they revealed they actually intended to decapitate Elminster and carry his head as a trophy to Sembia, a number of hidden doppelgangers fired a volley of crossbows into the band, slaying them almost on the spot.</p>
