<h2>History</h2>
<p>On 229 DR at The Kissing Wench , a tavern, Shandathe Llaerin propositioned her services to a local thief of Hastarl , Eladar the Dark, who was secretly Prince Elminster Aumar . Before they came to an arrangement, local dandy Jansibal Otharr outbid him and nearly had his guards start a confrontation. After the situation was de-escalated, Shandathe's servicing of Jansibal was interrupted again, this time by Eladar and his friend Farl , who knocked out Jansibal, and borrowed one of Shandathe's earrings, which they used to convince another local dandy, Thelorn Selemban , that Shandathe would know him, unsatisfied by Jansibal. Shandathe complied, rather enthusiastically. Afterwards, to remove suspicion from her, they took her and hurled her through the bedroom window of a local baker, Hannibur , despite her rising wariness.</p>
<p>She started seeing Hannibur on the evenings after that, and after a while, they got married. Eladar the Dark brought them a number of coins for their wedding night.</p>
<p>Later in 240 DR , Shandathe was kidnapped from their bakery by the men of King Belaur Aumar , for the king had caught sight of her face and fancied her. However, the King was prevented from having carnal contact with her because his castle was besieged at that precise point, requiring him to move to a safer location within the castle. She was later rescued by Myrjala Talithyn and reunited with her husband upon the death of King Belaur.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Eladar the Dark noted some time after hurling Shandathe inside Hannibur's home that no word of the meeting between Shandathe and Hannibur had spread, which made him wonder why.</p>
<p>On Year of the Hippogriff's Folly, 241 DR , Elminster Aumar was mind-called to Druindar's Rock : Delmuth Echorn lured him in with an image of Shandathe bound and tortured, begging him to save her. This was but a ruse unrelated to the real Shandathe.</p>
