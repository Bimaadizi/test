<p>Giantspine , or Jotunspine , was the largest island within the kingdom of Norheim in the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Giantspine was centrally located among the Norheim Isles . It sat between the Trackless Sea and the Sea of Moonshae on Northwind Strait in the northwest corner of the Moonshae Isles. The Giantspine Range dominated much of the island and shielded the eastern coast from the storms that rolled in off of the Trackless Sea. Giantspine was unique among the rocky islands of Norheim in that it contained several pockets of forested land. It was the only one of the Norheim Isles that could meaningfully support agriculture or where mining was a contributor to the economy.</p>
