<p>Longtooth was a style of enchanted dagger favored by folk of smaller size, such as halflings and gnomes .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Longtooth daggers were quite rare but were identifiable by their unusually long, broad, and heavy blades. They were easy to confuse for mundane daggers or otherwise normal enchanted daggers unless wielded by one of the smaller races .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When wielded by smaller folk, the dagger would lengthen, allowing it to be wielded as a short sword but with the same weight and ease-of-use as a dagger.</p>
<p>Longtooths were ensorcelled with a simple +2 enchantment that guided the wielder's hand towards the target and increased the weapon's damage. However, they were additionally able to cut through stone or wood as if these materials were much softer.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , one such dagger was stashed away in caves within the Wyrm's Tooth glacier claimed by a tribe of frost giants .</p>
