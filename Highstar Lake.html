<p>Highstar Lake was a body of water located in the Delimbiyr Vale region of the Savage Frontier . It was the subject of a number of tales, legends, mystifying appearances and mysterious disappearances.</p>
<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>This lake was known by many names among humans and other races, being called "Daeurimlakh" by dwarves and "Evendim" by elves , though Highstar was the most commonly used. Most maps of the High Moor region neglected to label the lake with any specific name.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Highstar was quite famous for its clear, mirror-like surface. It sat in a bowl formed by granite in the north and west, as well as marble and limestone in the south and east. In the western reaches of granite there was a gap that the lake drained out of, forming a waterfall and series of rapids along the granite cliffs that culminated in the hark river , the southernmost tributary of the River Shining .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The lake was located north of the High Moor , a bit west of Mount Hlim , in the northeastern area of the High Moor .</p>
<p>It was northeast of several towers that were remnants of ancient Miyeritar .</p>
<p>The dwarfhold known as the Halls of the Hammer was located near the shores of the lake. Close to it was a cabin used by a band of adventurers , known as Hammer Hall .</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>Animals commonly found in and around the Highstar included frogs , giant catfishes , leeches , and toads .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Highstar began life as a mere sinkhole in the High Moors plateau.</p>
<p>Around the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , a malevolent mage was spreading poison within the waters of the lake. This devious act killed large populations of its aquatic life.</p>
<p>During the 15 th century DR , a number of men from the surrounding area went missing and were believed to have been abducted by Highstar Lake's fabled denizen. They always returned after a few days' time, with pockets full of ancient elven coins .</p>
<p>Similarly, infants would periodically appear at the shores of the lake. The locals that took these babies in believed they were the offspring of the same being.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The source of the lake's enigmatic goings-on was a creature known as the "lady in the lake" . Not much was known about her, except that she sometimes took a form that resembled a nymph and other times appeared as a grotesque ichthyic creature.</p>
<p>An amethyst dragon by the name of Sh'derra D'zeer also resided within the lake. In terms of undead , wights and lacedons were known to be found within the lake.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>It was said by some that the depths of Highstar Lake contained the ruins of an ancient airship that once flew over the skies of Netheril .</p>
<p>Some claimed that a lich dwelled within the alleged ruins of the lake.</p>
<p>Another legend told of an ancient temple beneath its waters, that was dedicated to some long-lost deity .</p>
