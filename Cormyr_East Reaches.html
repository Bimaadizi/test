<p>The East Reaches of Cormyr were an expansive frontier east of the heartlands , made up of the lightly-inhabited lands beyond the Wyvernwater that stretched from the border of Sembia to the edge of the Anauroch desert.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The east reaches and west reaches were commonly regarded as the future of Cormyr, as part of a steady wave of settlement and taming of the wilds. The eastern lands ranged from the rolling Eastern Plains near the coast , the dense and inhospitable Hullack Forest , and the dry grasslands of Tilver's Gap and the Stonelands . It was scattered with villages, forts, and rural noble estates, and home to many monsters and bandits.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The east reaches broadly encompassed the lands north of the Way of the Manticore , east and north of the Wyvernwater, and north of Arabel and the Stonecliff . At its furthest extent it included Thunder Gap , Tilver's Gap, and the Stonelands, though this claim was only enforced by occasional Purple Dragons patrols.</p>
