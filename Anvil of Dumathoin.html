<p>The Anvil of Dumathoin was a powerful iron golem constructed by the dwarves of Frostsilver Mines and stored in a secret room in their deepest and most hidden forge. Its creators considered it to be sacred to Dumathoin , the dwarven god of secrets, until it went berserk.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The "Anvil" was a massive, dwarf-shaped iron golem that behaved erratically owing to the fact that it was animated by the trapped spirit of an earth elemental , likely one with a connection to the equally erratic elemental known as the Soul of Frostsilver .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The Anvil was extremely durable and resilient. In combat, it would dislodge bounders to fall on its opponents, thus causing a great deal of damage to the Mines in which it fought. It also wielded a massive sword, could spew poison at any foes who got too close, and could project a column of fire .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Anvil of Dumathoin was responsible for the violent catastrophe that wiped out the dwarves of Frostsilver Mines when it went on a rampage. So complete and brutal was this event that it led to many of the dwarves returning as wrathful undead , and the truth of what happened became lost amid tales that Mines were merely cursed. However, some tales did persist of a powerful object sacred to Dumathoin.</p>
<p>These tales led a hobgoblin warlord named Mrolgyet to send his agents— Grocknock and Snarlclaw —to tunnel into the Mines and claim the Anvil. Using trolls to dig and rust monsters to eat through metal doors, they nearly reached the secret room in which it was housed before the arrival of adventurers in the service of Open Lord Laeral Silverhand of Waterdeep . Realizing that the Anvil would be a danger if it fell into the clutches of Mrolgyet's Legion , these adventurers thwarted the efforts to claim the golem and then battled the construct itself.</p>
<p>Despite having been defeated by the adventurers, the golem proved difficult to destroy, and could reanimate to rampage through the abandoned Frostilver Mine again.</p>
