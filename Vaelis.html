<p>Vaelis was a young human paladin and Kalen Dren 's first apprentice.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Kalen took Vaelis on as his apprentice with the intent of training him to be the heir to the Shadowbane title. But later Kalen believed he had accidentally killed Vaelis in the underground of Waterdeep .</p>
<p>However, either Vaelis never died or was resurrected by someone for, the following year , he began crusading in Westgate as Shadowbane . Vaelis became a servant of the vampire Kirenkirsalai and aided him in a plot that apparently revolved around capturing Myrin Darkdance . Vaelis believed that the god of vengeance, Hoar , was the true third deity of the Threefold God trinity and he incorporated Hoar's belief in vengeance into his crusading.</p>
<p>Vaelis confronted Kalen in Westgate and was defeated, losing an arm in the fight. Near death, Vaelis returned to Kirenkirsalai's lair and was turned into a vampire.</p>
