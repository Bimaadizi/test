<h2>History</h2>
<p>Cedric became regent of Corwell after the death of High King Cymrych Hugh and the retirement of his father in the Year of the Storm Crown, 250 DR . Cymrych's heir, Warren I was still a child, and this led to disorganization among the kingdoms of the Ffolk . As Warren I established the Cymrych Dynasty from Caer Callidyrr , Cedric continued to rule the family's ancestral seat at Corwell as a steward of the Hugh Dynasty .</p>
<p>Cedric's tenure as regent outlasted both the reign of High King Warren I (which ended in 259 DR ) and the reign of his successor, High Queen Tamara ( 263 DR ), and ended during the time of High King Carrig Cymrych I . After him, Corwell came to be ruled by its own royal family like the other Ffolk kingdoms throughout the Isles.</p>
