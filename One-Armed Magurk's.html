<p>One-Armed Magurk's was a shop in the town of Thunderstone in Cormyr in the late 1360s DR run by Magurk .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Magurk purchased—no questions asked—goods looted by adventurers from ruins and dungeons found within the untamed wildernesses around Thunderstone: the Hullack Forest , the Thunder Peaks , and the Vast Swamp . He sold it on in his store, and thus his selection varied greatly over time, but generally included a varied collection of artworks, gems, and jewelry; weapons and armor; books; and used equipment.</p>
<p>As Magurk was a former soldier of the Purple Dragons , the local contingent kept a close watch on the store.</p>
