<p>The Ravens Bluff Hall of Records , also known as the Town Archives , was the central municipal archive of the city of Ravens Bluff in the 14 th century DR , until it had burned down in 1371 DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Hall of Records stood on the southwest corner of the intersection of Raphiel Road & Turnhelm Street , in the Gowntown neighborhood of Ravens Bluff's Temple District .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The building was a long hall, with walls lined in documents, and a cellar.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>This building was entrusted with the storage and protection of all manner of Ravens Bluff's civic documents, including permits, deeds, the records of Ravenian knighthoods, what scarce records were coerced out of the guilds of Ravens Bluff , and some historic books . Though not all of the city government's plans were stored within the hall, as many forms of documentation were kept in the Raven Museum and customs records were kept in Narwhal Manor .</p>
<p>Citizenry could enter the Hall of Records at any time to request the aid of its clerks in finding some form of documentation, though they would not freely give out details on just any Ravenian's file out of concerns that doing so may violate their privacy.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , sometime after the Three Women War , a group of adventurers entered the Hall of Records on an idle day and inquired with a male clerk that was on duty for a list of Ravenians with permits to own mammoths , as they were on a search for the missing pet Billie . The clerk responded by asking them for a name, explaining that their records for animal permits were organized by the names of permit holders. Pulling out a large tome, he flipped to a section labeled "MO" and gave them the ringmaster Jack Mooney as an example, citing his permits for seven mammoths in addition to permits for carnivorous apes , lions , tigers , and bears . The clerk was at a loss without a name, offering to look through his books for them in his spare time, but such a task would take a month. Before leaving they inquired about a mysterious Mistress Charnela , to which the clerk informed them she had a resident alien permit valid for a tenday period.</p>
<p>Sometime later on a late night, a large fire broke out in the Hall of Records. The building was completely destroyed by the fire before the Red Ravens could control it, burning many civic documents considered to be irreplaceable, including the trade agreement with The Murkos and records and documents created during Belanor Fenmarel 's time as the Acting Mayor of Ravens Bluff. The latter made up the largest portion of documents to be destroyed, leading to rumors that government officials loyal to Belanor may have been responsible for the blaze. A number of documents, namely the records of knightly orders and Ravenian guilds, managed to survive due to copies having been stored in the Raven Museum in case of just such a blaze.</p>
<p>While the Clerical Circle and Knights Council quickly reacted to the loss of the Hall of Records, the Ravenian government had no immediate plan of action to address the catastrophe. Of the two the Knights Council's reaction was the most swift and pronounced, promptly printing fliers requesting all knights to notify the Council of their allegiances by providing copies of their official heraldry and their official certificate of knighthood. In the wake of this it came to light that there were many bogus knights in Ravens Bluff with no proper claim to their title. Additionally, the Knights Council made staunch vow that from then on the records for all knightly orders were going to be safely kept within the Hall of the Raven , even if the Hall of Records was rebuilt. The Clerical Circle, meanwhile, appointed a representative to investigate the fire and hopefully uncover its cause. Their chosen representative was a Kossuthan priest , whom prior to the incident had been working alongside a building inspector to aid in the demolition of buildings that were deemed condemned by the city.</p>
<p>Within that same year efforts were underway to reconstruct the building, but slowed by the intervening interests of various merchants , who viewed the plot of land where the Hall of Records stood as a prime location for a luxury apartment block. Reconstruction was also complicated by the burnt ruins and their scorched cellars being frequented homeless squatters, whom the City Watch frequently had to chase off the premises. Beyond the homeless, the burnt husk of the Hall of Records was reported by the Watch to be a frequent site for clandestine meetings between lovers, merchants making private deals, and adventurers involved in shadowy acts of intrigue.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The clerks of the Hall of Records included Trudy and the Deneirian Caitlin .</p>
