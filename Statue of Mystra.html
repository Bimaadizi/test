<p>The statue of Mystra was a magical statue of the goddess Mystra standing in the Stoneyard of the false Temple of Mystra in Wheloon in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>To aid in their deception, the false priests of the temple bought up a large quantity of religious paraphernalia, but chose to destroy much of what they did not need or found to be against the faith of Shar . Among these was a statue of Mystra, whose holy and miraculous nature surprised them. No matter how they damaged it each day, it was whole again the next night. It then exuded a disturbing glow. The Sharrans then tried to hide it by heaping the debris about it, but this was always shed again. Though the temple was a front for followers of Shar, and thus within her dark power, Mystra's holy image had given her influence and the chance to oppose their sacrilege.</p>
<p>When adventurers in service to Mystra investigating the temple passed through on Eleint 6 , the statue of Mystra could well have come alive to battle the dark earth elemental that rose out of the shattered statuary in the Stoneyard. It would give a motion of blessing before falling dormant again.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was a statue of a woman representing the goddess Mystra. It gave off a glow of flickering starry light. This was a powerful aura of abjuration magic.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The statue of Mystra had the miraculous ability to renew and reveal itself over the course of a night, no matter how it was damaged or obscured.

Furthermore, it bestowed a blessing on all those within arm's reach, granting good fortune that protected mind and body against attacks by dark creatures and those from the Plane of Shadow .</p>
<p>It could even become an animated object , that slammed its stone limbs into opponents.</p>
