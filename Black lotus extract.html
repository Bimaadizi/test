<p>Black lotus extract was a potent poison created using the black lotus orchid-like flowers. The poison was created in a powder or oil form.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The powder took effect within seconds of skin contact. The substance's high price was due to black lotus blooming only once per three years. The toxin contained within was extracted as oil.</p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>Black lotus extract was considered to be one of the most deadly contact poisons ever devised. Few survived encounters with those whose blades were coated in the dangerous substance. When black lotus extract touched the skin of a creature, it immediately affected their physical health, quickly weakening them and likely ending in death.</p>
