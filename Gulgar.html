<p>A gulgar ( pronounced : /ˈ g ə l g ɑː ɑːr / GUHL-gaar ) was a humanoid creature with distinct crystalline protrusions. They were native to the Elemental Plane of Earth but had immigrated to the Earthroot region of the Underdark and the Sunrise Mountains .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gulgars had broad, muscular, gray-skinned bodies. The skin of males darkened as they aged, ultimately becoming black; females lightened as they aged, such that the oldest females were white.</p>
<p>Both sexes had crystalline protrusions erupting from their bodies, including a "horn" protruding forward from their chins, two "tusks" protruding from their lower jaws, and further crystals growing from their knuckles and shoulders. The crystals were as hard as adamantine when living, but they became brittle, like quartz , when detached from an individual.</p>
<p>A gulgar's head was thick and elongated, hanging low over the chest. Their eyes were small, black, and deep set. They had tiny rhinoceros -like ears. Their hands had only three digits, which were thick and stubby with crystalline nails.</p>
<p>Gulgars spoke the Terran language, but they did so with deep, subsonic voices, too low for most other creatures to hear. Only creatures with the such abilities as being able to sense tremors in the ground or with blindsight provided by preternatural hearing could hear gulgars speak. They made very few audible sounds otherwise.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>To most who meet them, gulgars seemed gloomy in mood and terse in conversation, but this was because of the distrust that they had of most strangers—especially dwarves , with whom they shared a history of conflict. Among their own kind, they were quite energetic.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The voice of a gulgar could carry for about five times the distance of creatures speaking in more typical vocal ranges. They also could generate a powerful sonic blast strong enough to deafen enemies. (Those unfortunate enough to have heard this sonic pulse gave the gulgars their name based on what this sounded like.)</p>
<p>Their broad bodies made them very stable on their feet; they were very difficult to shove or trip.</p>
<p>Gulgars had excellent hearing but inferior vision, though they could see in utter darkness .</p>
<h2>Diet</h2>
<p>Gulgars could consume both plant and animal matter, but they also fed on crystals found in the depths of mountains. This diet provided strength to their crystalline bones.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Gulgars were brave and exuberant in battle, charging into battle with warhammers and heavy shields . They often wore breastplates for armor.</p>
<p>They were tactical on the ground and uses physical attacks as well as their weapons, shoving foes off cliffs or stabbing with the horns on their chins.</p>
<p>Their favored mounts were yrthaks , which also produced powerful sonic waves. Gulgars used their own sonic pulses to tame the beasts. When fighting from the back of their flying mounts, gulgars favored composite longbows or lances . They avoided using their own sonic pulses while mounted.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Gulgars were tribal. They preferred to live in temperate mountainous regions, within cliffs—typically ones were yrthaks also nested. In addition to war mounts, yrthaks also served as beasts of burden.</p>
<p>Gulgars spent much of their time mining for the crystals that they craved to consume. They also mine metal ore and use it to craft their weapons, armor, and crude sculptures, which they use to tell their history.</p>
<p>Many gulgars had training as fighters , but their leaders often had druidic or ranger -like skills. Gulgar society did not include many clerics .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The gulgars were said to have come to the Prime Material plane to escape from genies .</p>
