<p>Cable was a term describing several distinct manufactured products, similar to common rope , though on occasion was confusingly also used to refer to common rope.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The most common use of cable referred to immensely thick and strong ropes, such as thigh-thick hawsers used for mooring and anchoring large ships or the lines used to support the movements of massive mechanisms.</p>
<p>A less common form of cable found in the Realms was a thinner, lighter construction made of a thick twisted wire with rope woven around it. It was extremely strong for its weight, able to hold surprising amounts of weight, and highly resistant to cutting thanks to the core.</p>
<p>A rare form of cable was wholly made of metal or another material, without including any woven rope.</p>
