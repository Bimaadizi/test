<p>A disguise kit was a set of tools and props that allowed a person to disguise their physical appearance.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A typical disguise kit consisted of a pouch with cosmetics, dyes , and assorted objects that supported the role to be impersonated.</p>
<p>Special disguise kits sold by Aurora's Emporium also included fake facial hair that could be attached to the user's face using tree sap, which was included in a vial within the kit. They also came with blocks of coal and chalk to darken and lighten facial details, a wad of clay that could be molded to change facial features, a felt hat that could assume different shapes, and a linen coif that could be used as a hood.</p>
