<p>Shedaklah was the 222 nd layer of the Abyss . It was ruled by two different demon princes , Zuggtmoy and Juiblex , who continually fought for control over the layer.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Shedaklah was largely a place of swamps and bogs, with regions of low hills and foggy moors. There were no stars, sun, or moon, and the sky was always overcast. The clouds were often unpleasant and unnatural shades like mud-brown, bruise-purple, or a foul, rotten green, and storms were frequent, with torrential downpours and thunderstorms often flooding the land. The whole realm was very humid, with everything seemingly covered in a layer of moisture, and the temperature was stable at around 90 ℉ (32 ℃ ).</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>The layer of Shedaklah was relatively well-travelled for a layer of the Abyss, due to the two branches of the River Styx that flowed through it. One branch formed a boundary between the two warring demon princes, while the other branch went deeper into Zuggtmoy's territory. The branch that formed a boundary was guarded by creatures of both realms, with one shore patrolled by fungi creatures, and the other shore covered in jellies and slimes. The other branch, however, wound its way through swamps and fungal shallows full of floating fungi, mindless horrors, and a tribe of parasite-riddled cannibals.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Shedalkah was, like most of the Abyss, inhabited by a variety of demons : vrocks , hezrous , vathugas , chasmes , and rutterkin were all common on this layer. Additionally, a wide variety of fiendish and half-fiendish fungi such as basidironds , myconids , phycomids , and phantom fungi could be found there, as well as plants such as shambling mounds and red sundew , albeit infested with fungal growths, and rukarazyll and oozes .</p>
<p>Among the creatures that lived in Shedaklah's "jungles" were the threeb , a type of leech used to make quelaerel sauce.</p>
