<p>Borin Woodbracer was a dwarven ex-adventurer who worked for Lord Partic Thistle as a handyman at Thistleflame Keep circa 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Borin was a gruff and quiet fellow, but also creative and thoughtful. He adored the exterior stonework of Thistleflame, a major influence on his desire to work at the estate.</p>
<p>He had an unfortunate habit of drinking too much at the Bubbling Bulwark and rampaging around the common room, breaking furniture and causing a mess. This would result in Lord Thistle paying for the damages, or Borin performing the repairs himself.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He had a magical warhammer from his time as an adventurer.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Borin was a good friend to Thistleflame's gardener, Berke Glorata , as he didn't feel threatened by his stunning good looks. He tended to get on less well with elves and half-elves such as Kaleb Fleetwing , who he had a general distrust of.</p>
