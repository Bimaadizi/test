<p>Faerglamer House was the residence of Bilnur Faerglamer through the late 9 th and throughout the 10 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The house was in Tethyr .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>During Bilnur's stay, the house was inhabited by him alone, with piles of coins abandoned across the floor; birds nested freely inside the abandoned rooms. The outside of the house remained overgrown and somewhat dilapidated. After he died, the house slowly turned into a ruin, broken open to the sky.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Bilnur Faerglamer lived there and used it as a workshop.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>While Bilnur lived there, he had a number of guardians, probably variants of helmed horrors with more power than normal; those melted apart after his death.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to the Year of the Curse, 882 DR , the house had been built for a then-extinct family. Bilnur Faerglamer lived in the house from around 882 DR , the better part of seventy years prior to 952 DR , to 977 DR , the year of his death. After his death, the house decayed into a ruin, with the coinage stashed there soon taken.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Though the coins that Bilnur hoarded had been taken long since, some mages of the late 14 th century DR still expected to find a cache somewhere in the ruined and overgrown manor. However, there were rumors of often invisible shapechangers hunting visitors to the ruins.</p>
