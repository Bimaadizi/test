<p>Rulthaven was a famous sage of the town of Easting in the Western Heartlands in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Rulthaven specialized in botany and studied plants and their uses, such as herbs and poisons . Both good priests and agents of Darkhold came to consult with him.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was studious and focused on his work, and got excited about new vegetable matter to study. He was neutral on matters of religion and politics.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Rulthaven had once seen what he termed a " star-spore " that had fallen from the sky. He theorized it had originated on the green world of Coliar , and supposed that if life existed there, then it must be so different to life on Toril that it would be poisonous to it. Fortunately, he developed an antidote to the effects of the star-spore.</p>
<p>But it would be years before he got a chance to test it. Then, in the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR , he sighted another star-spore fall from the sky, landing near Darkhold, several days' ride from Easting, and quickly went to examine it. However, it was discovered by a band of adventurers known as the Seekers — Bublim Barboast , Esta Starchild , Furian Arcanus , Lorrick , Samkin Silvertooth , and Trothgar —who hoped to find the Tear of Selûne they were seeking. They found only rocks covered in a yellow fungal mold, and fell sick and beset by disturbing dreams, and lay slowly dying. Less affected Lorrick and Samkin rode hard for Easting to find Rulthaven, hoping he might have a cure, and chanced to encounter him coming the other way. With Rulthaven's treatments, the adventurers recovered in Easting over a period of several days, during which the sage visited the crater and eagerly collected samples of the star-spore for his research.</p>
