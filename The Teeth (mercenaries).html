A squad of five ogre warriors led by Rarnok Jadronson attacked and destroyed the tiny village of Oakwood Knoll alongside Skull and Club mercenaries, losing two of their number to the determined defense of the locals. As the two mercenary groups argued and almost came to blows over the spoils, a group of adventurers traveling to Shadowdale may have overcome them and saved the remaining villagers.</p>
