<p>Nagas ( pronounced : /ˈ n ɑː g ɑː z / NA-gaz ) were serpentine creatures of great intellect and natural mastery of sorcery.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nagas resembled giant snakes with heads that bore a humanoid resemblance. They typically ranged from 10​ to ​20 feet (3​ to ​6.1 meters) in length and weighed around 200‒500 lb (91‒230 kg). Though some were known to be over a 100 feet (30 meters) in length.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Nagas were known to have a natural affinity for spellcasting, being born with an inherent understanding of the art of magic .</p>
<h3>Biology</h3>
<p>Though nagas and their deities were perceived as having distinct sexes, they were an entirely hermaphrodite species. A naga could reproduce by copulating with another member of their subrace or simply by impregnating itself. No method was preferred over the other and the choice of method came down to convenience or personal preference.</p>
<p>Much like most snake and reptile species, nagas were known to dislike cold climates.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nagas were created by the sarrukh in the early days of Mhairshaulk as a servitor race. They were created by magically interbreeding powerful serpents with the natural intelligence and inquisitiveness of humans . In their capacity as servitors they served the sarrukh as guards, researchers of magic, and explorers of uncharted lands.</p>
<p>The first nagas to be created were water nagas , who were bred for the purpose of exploring the vast lands and oceans of Abeir-Toril . Over time, the nagas helped the sarrukh to establish the foundations of magic in the kingdoms of Mhairshaulk, Isstosseffifi , Okoth .</p>
<h2>Subspecies of Naga</h2>
<p>After the fall of Mhairshaulk and Shekinester's split into five guises, five major subspecies of nagas arose, as well as at least four minor subspecies.</p>
<p>There was a particular undead form of naga called bone nagas , normally created as guardians.</p>
<p>A similar-looking creature created by spirit nagas as servitors was the nagatha .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Because of the flexibility their species had in regards to reproduction, the concept of mates held far less importance among nagas compared to other creatures.</p>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>Prior to his fragmentation, all nagas worshiped the World Serpent . Some theologians speculated that their curiosity and questioning over his many facets was what led to him fragmenting.</p>
<p>Following the World Serpent's fragmentation and the fall of Mhairshaulk most nagas worshiped Shekinester , a lesser goddess that fragmented from him, and her son Parrafaire . Banelar nagas were known to worship either Bane or Cyric .</p>
<h3>Magic</h3>
<p>Lesser kiira , or "lore gems", were commonly created and used by nagas.</p>
