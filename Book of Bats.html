<p>The Book of Bats was an ancient spellbook of uncertain origin that contained a number of uncommon arcane and divine spells .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This was a tall and narrow tome, measuring approximately three handwidths wide and nine handwidths tall. All 22 pages were made from polished electrum and these were etched and stamped with the scripts and symbols of spell-craft, with each page containing a different spell. The front and rear covers of the book were plates made of sealed and blackened oak and these bound with the tattered leathery hides and wings of real bats of large size, many of which still contained their claws. These of course gave it a gruesome appearance.</p>

<p>After that, the book changed hands surprisingly many times over its history, often by thievery or force as one mage or minor ruler after killed the prior owner.</p>
<p>At one point, the merchant Chulu Thall of Ithmong somehow acquired the Book of Bats and sold it to the mage Khondall Sszundar . But he had it but briefly before an unknown enemy dispatched demons that demolished his tower, and the tome was lost. Shortly after, the Book of Bats resurfaced in Innarlith , then was swiftly stolen.</p>
<p>Circa 1357 DR, the archmage Malharduu apparently purchased the tome and made arrangements to have it shipped to Tashluta . However, in summer, the ship carrying the book was looted by thieves before it could leave the dock in Calimport . The fate of the book remained unknown.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
