<p>Soubar ( pronounced : /ˈ s uː b ɑːr / SOO-bar ) was a small village on the Trade Way , south of the Boareskyr Bridge and Forest of Wyrms , north of Scornubel . It was often used as a way-station for traders traveling along that road.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The population was highly variable, shrinking to an armed camp in the winter with the decline of caravan traffic. Soubar had no formal government, which led to a lawless culture full of brigands and ruffians.</p>
<h2>History</h2>

The project was unpopular with some locals, but they were advised to remember the Creed Resolute , which discouraged religious discrimination.</p>
