<p>Morian was a Netherese priest who worked as an Underchief at Constabulary Branch Three in Eileanar before its destruction in 3520 NY (−339 DR) .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He had black hair, a strong preference for gray clothing, and spoke in a smooth, unaccented baritone. He seemed to only ever be seen wearing the one gray suit, with a sword , dagger , and a pouch closed with a wire loop on his belt.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Morian aided Chief Constable Emblemat alongside Underchiefs Goddard and Cadogen as they collectively managed the lower-ranked constables.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He appeared mysteriously in the enclave during the early spring of 3512 NY (−347 DR) . The first thing he did was buy a piece of property in the city and apply for work as a constable, and little more than that was known by his fellows. He kept his house shuttered, took no guests, and had no family. It was rumored that a thief had once broken in, only to find the building empty of any furnishings or other possessions.</p>
