<p>Manferic III was a human mage and king of Ankhapur , who took on the path of lichdom so that he could rule over his city for a long time.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Manferic was nearly identical to his brother Tomas , save for him having a full head of hair whilst his brother was bald. He had a regal, leonine mane of blond hair and a flaring red beard, with a wild savage look to his face.</p>
<p>In the days leading up to his destruction, having achieved lichdom relatively recently, Manferic's body mostly maintained an air of liveliness. He could have hurried through the streets of Ankhapur at midnight if he so wished and be mistaken, at worst, for someone suffering from consumption . His body was thin and sharp of bone, seemingly devoid of body fat from the grave worms that scuttled beneath his skin, and always partially hunched over, as if it was bearing some great weight. He had a pale, pearly gray complexion with a translucent quality to it, as if someone had painted over his skin with wax . His eyes had a fiery light behind them. His once proud mane of hair had turned thin and white. And his voice took on a chill, rasping and grinding wheeze.</p>
<p>As his body further deteriorated it gave off a palid corpse odor, not unlike that of rotting fish . His tongue became a swollen, oozing mass, his lips blackened and shredded, and his scalp peeling. And eventually his body began to leave a putrescent trail of rot and grave worms wherever it went.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Manferic was a cold, manipulative, paranoid, ruthless, and overall lawful evil man with a twisted sense of humor. He cared little for respect, feeling such platitudes amounted merely to poor advice and empty words. And after his transformation into a lich, his mind descended into even more viler depths, though he remained strangely sentimental, albeit in a cold and heartless fashion. He began dissociatively referring to his time alive in the third-person, as if it had been the life of another. And he was also quite vain even into undeath, detesting the decomposing nature of his undead form and was unwilling to settle for ruling Ankhapur behind closed doors.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He was a powerful wizard, whose considerable skill in the Art insured his steadfast grip on Ankhapur. As a skilled wizard Manferic possessed a wide array of spells . His repertoire included the following:</p>
<p>Beyond the arts of spellcraft, Manferic was also versed in gem cutting, astrology , brewing, and herbalism . As well as proficient in fighting with daggers , darts , and staves .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He was not known to have possessed any magical items of note.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He ruled Ankhapur with an iron hand and a touch of sadism. Instilling fear in the populace, having dissidents and rivals disappeared under the cover of night, and removing pawns that had outlived their useful with ruthless efficiency. Within his court, such notions as love, generosity, and kindness were often tossed aside in the service of survival.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Manferic notably kept and raised a number of quaggoths , monstrous humanoids of the Underdark , as special slavish servants and pets. He often times had them act in the capacity of hunters and jailers, serving as one of the king's "special" punishments, one from which he would watch through a scrying ball . With their eyes naturally attuned to darkness , the beasts had little trouble navigating the corridors of his castle's dungeon . And they were trained not to attack anyone carrying his royal seal.</p>
<p>Manferic had five children, all sons. The first of these was Janol , a bastard child he had with Lady Tulan , the lady-in-waiting to his queen. After discovering she was pregnant Manferic had her kept away in his castle's catacombs until the baby was born, then gave her to one of his quaggoths, Ikrit , assuming he would kill her. He then went on to sire the sons Bors , Marac , Throdus , and Vargo with his actual wife, who he later drove to death. Of the four sons, Marac and Vargo grew to bear such resemblances to their father that Janol almost wondered if they weren't unfinished clones of Manferic cooked up in a laboratory.</p>
<p>Overall he did not have a pleasant relationship with his sons, the princes fearing him just as much as every other citizen of Ankhapur. Guards, servants, and nobles alike feared the king, with the latter dreadful that on a whim Manferic would strip them of their title or confiscate their lands. And on more than one ocassion, servants were whisked away out of Manferic delusionally believing they were plotting to poison him.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Distrustful of his other family members and determined to have no one that could challenge his reign, he had the other members of his family purged, killing the likes of brothers, sisters, and uncles. One of the few surviving members was his brother, Tomas, who would be left with the title Duke of the Port.</p>
<p>During his reign Manferic instituted Ankhapur's tradition of employing the mightiest mages in the region and requiring them to wear identifying white shifts or other apparel whilst in the city.</p>
<p>Fearful that his wife's body was barren and unable to conceive, Manferic took to sleeping with her lady-in-waiting to sire an heir and conceived Janol in 1326 DR . However, eventually his wife did conceive a son, and then three more in the years that followed. With four true heirs to his name, Manferic decided not to acknowledge that he was Janol's father, but instead proclaimed him to be his Royal Ward, concocting and spreading a story of how he came to be adopted. Manferic claimed that Janol's mother, the lady-in-waiting, had died in childbirth and that the father was a knight and noted captain in his king's guard, by the name of "Sir Gedstad of Alkar", who had died whilst fighting in the kingdom's wars against swamp trolls .</p>
<p>For the next few years Manferic would raise Janol with a surface level of kindness and generosity, masking his cold intentions, all the while his other sons mistreated the boy through their arrogance and jealousy. As the poor grew up he always referred to him as his "son", though Janol himself could never figure if this was just some form of mockery or done to irritate his other heirs.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Highmantle, 1336 DR , a group of peasants on the estates of Ankhapuran nobles drew up a list of grievances against their lords. They were being taxed twice the rate demanded of the crown, those too old to farm were executed, and young boys were being whipped into Ankhapur's militia. The five bravest of the peasants approached Manferic III with their list, demanding reform. He promised the farmers action, then the next day, whilst he was 'considering' their requests, he sent his sons Throdus and Vargo with a detachment of priests of the Red Lord to their houses, wherein they killed and then reanimated the farmers' wives as zombies . The next day, Manferic proclaimed that he would indeed enact the reforms, but only if the farmers all swore to love and honor their wives for the rest of their days. Should even one of the farmers falter, all would be made an example of as rebels, and inevitably one of them did.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Crown, 1351 DR , Manferic III had come to the idea of achieving immortality through lichdom. That same year, his son Janol was driven out of home by his legitimate heirs. Manferic provided the boy no aid against this, for he thought it a good idea to have him send him away, viewing Janol as a threat to his goals. However, he had no desire for Janol to die, seeing in him a sort of insurance against his sons. The King felt there was a chance he might have need of his bloodline someday, one that he could access in case he had eliminated his other sons for insubordination. Manferic was also certain that, in being forced to live out on his own, Janol's resolve would strengthen and become resourceful. Whereas if allowed to stay, he was likely to end up a lackey of the legitimate princes.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR , Manferic III achieved lichdom. However, it was not long before he grew dissatisfied with being a lich, enraged that none of the books and scrolls he consulted on the process mentioned how his looks would deteriorate. He eventually came to the idea of transferring his conscious into the body of a rightful heir, from which he then could rule Ankhapur as a sort of regent. Feeling that his four sons were too well known, that their friends would inevitably get suspicious of his behavior, Manferic settled on his bastard son Janol as the perfect candidate.</p>
<p>He sent his royal chamberlain Cleedis to the city-state of Elturel , to announce his passing to the long estranged son and implore him to return home, lest his brothers squabble and throw Ankhapur into a civil war. He ended up finding Janol sometime after he had stolen a Lathanderite relic called the amulet of the Dawnbreaker . Cleedis made it explicitly clear to the bristling rogue that he had no intention of putting him on the throne, only of hiring him for a job, a task given to him by his late father. With threats to alert the Hellriders lest he come with him, Janol acquiesced to the chamberlain's demands.</p>
<p>Later one night in Ankhapur, Cleedis escorted Janol to the Street of Crypts in the city's old poor district, to sit on a bench outside the royal mausoleum. Before long, Manferic III creaked the door to the crypt open and finally revealed himself to his estranged son. Through their exchange in the graveyard, he was reluctant to step out of the crypt and into the moon light, which left his son to wildly speculate as to whether Manferic was undead, still alive, or merely a clever illusion.</p>
<p>He explained to the shocked and slightly fearful Janol that he had been keeping tabs on his life as a rogue and was in need of one to steal The Cup and the Knife , the holiest artifacts of Ankhapur. By ancient law, in times when there was more than one contender for the throne, the crown was to be passed to the relative chosen by the cup and by extension the gods . Without them, no prince or princess could be crowned king or queen of Ankhapur. Until such a time as they were needed, these royal regalia were kept secured within a tower in the Temple of the Red Lord .</p>
<p>Manferic wanted them replaced with a pair of forged duplicates, which Cleedis had arranged the production of, and presented them before Janol. He emphasized that this task had to be carried out without anyone suspecting anything and the trade made before the Rite of Choosing could commence on the first day of Ankhapur's Money Festival , which was no more than a tenday away. It was an auspicious day to the Red Priests, one chosen by Hierarch Juricale , landed upon in part by the manipulations of Vargo Famisso and Cleedis struggling to stall the proceedings any further.</p>
<p>And in return, Manferic III primarily offered Janol his life and freedom. As he closed the crypt door, his parting words to Janol were, "Betray me and die. Fail me and suffer." With little trust for the rogue, chamberlain Cleedis heeded Janol to remember Manferic's words and on the walk away from the crypts claimed he was to be paid a sum of 10,000 bicentas , as well as passage to wherever he desired, though the scoundrel haggled him into raising the pay to 50,000 bicentas. Though it wasn't long before Janol came to the conclusion that, knowing his late father's disposition, likely his only reward for the task would be death.</p>
<p>When Janol later presented the stolen regalia to Cleedis, the chamberlain rebuffed him, saying that Manferic had insisted he be the one to deliver the royal regalia to him personally. The rogue agreed to this, though stipulated that Cleedis in return had to shown him to his mother, as through a mishap with The Cup and the Knife Janol had discovered he was of royal blood and worked up a hunch that a woman he saw whilst in the castle's dungeons may have been her. Under the cover of night the two crept out from the palace and made their way to the royal crypt. There Manferic ushered the two in, expressing annoyance with Cleedis for having kept him waiting when time was of the essence. He coldly commanded the regalia to be handed over to him, but the stubborn rogue rebuffed him, demanding he receive his promised payment first.</p>
<p>The lich scowled at his son, arguing with him for a moment over his attempts to swindle him out of 40,000 extra bicentas, but then quickly recognized that Janol must have figured out the truth of his parentage. He then made false promises of making Janol his Master of Spies, talking up how he had been made stronger from his time away from court. With indignation Chamberlain Cleedis interrupted the moment, trying to speak of his expectated recompense for his years of loyal service. Enraged, Manferic looked to the aging servant, and proclaimed "Lord Chamberlain, my faithful servant. There has always been the most honored of places for you in my plans. Indeed, your greatest service is about to come."</p>
<p>The lich then pointed a fleshless singer, casting the spell disintegrate , which emitted as an eerily green ray of light that sent the man screaming as his body quickly festered away into a gurgling mass of bubbling flesh, pus, and blood-soaked clothes. Manferic III then turned to his astonished son with a garish smile and said, "It has all been planned for," before asking him to hand over the royal regalia and join him in ruling Ankhapur, lest he face a cruel death like the chamberlain.</p>
<p>With little other choice, Janol found himself trapped alone in the crypts with Manferic and one of his quaggoths, Ikrit. The lich took his time to humor Janol with answers, regaling him with the further truths of his parentage, the lich's reasonings behind allowing him to be run out of home fifteen years prior, and ultimately his true intentions. As he did so, he commanded Janol to get his body dressed for the Rite of Choosing. When it came time Manferic had Ikrit restrain his son and used the spell magic jar to transfer Janol's soul into a gemstone , wherein it would then be crushed by the quaggoth and released into the afterlife . However, the mad king's plan went awry, as after the gem was crushed Janol's spirit instead went and inhabited the now empty husk that was Manferic's progressively decaying lich body. With time of the essence, Janol wandered through the crypts and encountered his friends on their way to save him. He explained to Maeve , Sprite-Heels , Therin , and the Lathanderite cleric Lissa his situation and managed to convince them of it.</p>
<p>By the time they arrived at the Great Hall of the Temple of the Red Lord, amidst the festivities of the Money Festival, Manferic III was standing inside behind Bors Famisso under the guise of the deceased Chamberlain Cleedis Flanked by temple warriors, Hierarch Juricale and an attendant priest brought forth The Cup and the Knife . The heroes watched the proceedings play out, waiting for the right time to strike. One by one Bors, Marac, and Throdus all stepped up to the cup and declined to undertake the Rite of Choosing, having all been persuaded by their brother Vargo through threats. Vargo cut his hand with the knife , allowing it to drip into the wine held by the cup , and then drake from it. The expected effect on a chosen claimant, a holy golden nimbus glow appearing around the imbiber's head, did not occur. As the assembly's gaze turned to Bors, Vargo clutched at his throat and felt to his knees, taking on a icy blue pallor and coughing up blood. Janol blurted out "Poison! Manferic's cup is poisonous!", and in the stunned silence that followed prompted Lissa to strike.</p>
<p>Lissa read aloud a spell scroll of dispel magic that Maeve had brought, but rather than displacing the two souls it merely dispelled Manferic's magical disguise. He bellowed with rage at Janol and his compatriots, raising his hands to cast a retaliatory spell. However, due to Janol's right hand having earlier been crippled, Manferic struggled to execute the somatic component of his spell and its arcane energies fizzled out like wisps of smoke. As he shrieked in frustration Lissa casted a spell, once again dispel magic , but this time it succeeded in returning Janol's soul to his own body and Manferic's psyche to the lich body. The mask and feathered cloak disguise that Janol had been skulking about in flew off as Manferic roared, proclaiming Janol to be a bastard-son before casting a fireball that tore across the coronation stage. Caught unprepared, Hierarch Juricale and a dozen of his Red Priests were left sprawling across the dais , as were Bors and Throdus.</p>
<p>Pandemonium swept through the crowd and revelers stampeded for the arched doorway, choking it and making it difficult for the Ankhapuran royal guard to enter. In short time, Vargo's loyal swordsmen rushed forward through the assembly to engage the lich, but Manferic dispatched them in little time, arcane displays flashing off his fingertips with finger of death . Then with a quick gesture he cast chaos upon the remaining, hesitant forces of Vargo, making them turn against one another. Then Lissa lunged at the lich, muttering a prayer lost amidst the screams, and clapped a hand on his shoulders that sent pain flowing through his undead body. Further enraged, Manferic cast spectral hand , manifesting a massive puffy and smooth hand with rings on its fingers that restrained the cleric.</p>
<p>Considering her beneath his notice, Manferic turned his attention back to scanning the hall for Janol and proclaimed that they could rule Ankhapur together if he just made the decision to stand by him. However, his son recognized the lich's words for the lies they were. Without waiting for a response, Manferic cast the spell cloudkill , emanating a thickly green smoke from his fingertips that pooled into a cloud and the smell of ammonia .</p>
<p>As it swept across the assembly towards the doorway, the screams in the hall were replaced by choked gurgles and shortly thereafter silence. As the bleeding, jaundiced and scalded bodies of the victims came into sight, the remaining crowd reached greater heights of hysteria, the nobility trampling over each other and pushing people aside to escape the cloud. Before long the sides of the hysterical mass broke and some fled to the sides of the hall to cower in fear. The leading guardsmen likewise lost their resolve and turned their swords upon anyone who would get in their way of fleeing. All the while, Manferic laughed maniacally, striding up the steps of the dais. He then turned to the hysterical crowd and proclaimed, "Nobles of Ankhapur, acknowledge your king, Manferic the Undying!"</p>
<p>Janol attempted to free Lissa from the spectral hand by slicing at it with a dagger, but it was to no avail. Emphasizing to him that they had little time, the Lathanderite wriggled and twisted a hand through the spectral fingers to present him the amulet of the Dawnbreaker . He was initially hesitant, calling her mad, but Lissa pleaded with him to wield it, reminding Janol that it scarred him with the "mark of the Morninglord." Noticing his son at last, Manferic yelled and sneered at Janol to get away from her and blamed him for the deaths of all the revelers that he had caused. The huddled survivors turned their gaze upon the rogue, who with amulet in hand rebuffed his father, saying that the deaths were on his hands.</p>
<p>Just as the lich was expressing regret for siring Janol, the halfling Sprite-Heels tried to lunged at him from behind with a short sword . Having put his weight into the blow, he staggered when the lich stepped to the side. Manferic grasped the halfling by the throat and cast a spell through fingers inches away from his face, slicing at Sprite's face with flashing arcane darts. His eyes were made bloody hollows, rendering him blind. Janol meanwhile held the amulet of the Dawnbreaker and yelled at it to do something. And as he thought hard about what it was that truly mattered to him, his compatriots, and how he'd ever be willing to sacrifice his other hand for them, the amulet glowed with a gleaming aura that cast out all shadows.</p>
<p>His undead flesh smoldering under the blazing light of the amulet, an effect equivalent to the sunray spell, tossed Sprite-Heels aside and launched magic missiles at his son. And though each one striked him dead on, making him stagger, Janol stood his ground. The amulet's glow continued to grow in intensity to a white blaze, with the power of the sun rising over the horizon, leaving all to appear like silhouettes cloaked in a luminous haze. Unleashing an inhuman screech Manferic's body was consumed in flames of red, blue, and gold. When the light of the amulet finally ceased, it was several minutes before those in the Great Hall could see clearly and witnessed a pile of white ash sitting where Manferic had once stood. And with his death, the spectral hand that had been restraining Lissa vanished. Looking over the carnage and finding that all of the princes were dead, with Marac's chest having been split open at some point during the chaos by some magical blast, Janol stepped forward and underewent the Rite of Choosing, showing all assemblied that he was the rightful new king of Ankhapur.</p>
<p>In the wake of Manferic's demise at the hands of the amulet of the Dawnbreaker , the Church of Lathander surged in popularity among the populace of Ankhapur. And the tale of the lich's demise continued to be the talk of the city well into the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR .</p>
