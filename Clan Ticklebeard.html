<p>Ticklebeard was a dwarvish clan, famous for the Crazy Wilbur technique of fighting.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR , Clan Ticklebeard had developed the Crazy Wilbur. The technique involved the returning dwarvish weapon enchantment . These enchanted weapons, like returning pikes , were allowed or forced to be swallowed by their opponents. Then, the fighters called the returning weapons back, making the flight back as ready and messy as possible.</p>
