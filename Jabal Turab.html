<p>Jabal Turab , or the Mount of Dust , was a mountain that housed an elemental vortex connecting two elemental planes .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Located 80 miles (130 kilometers) from the City of Brass , the Mount of Dust belched forth a great plume of white smoke that served as a gateway from the Elemental Plane of Fire to the Elemental Plane of Air . The elemental vortex terminated outside of the Djinni Caliphate .</p>
<p>This elemental vortex was used by the efreet to launch invasions on the djinn . The efreet kept it under constant guard to prevent the djinn from using it in the same fashion.</p>
