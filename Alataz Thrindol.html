<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before settling in the Ravilar's Cloak, Alataz Thrindol had a rich career and many travels under his belt. Alataz spent about a dozen years at the Cloak before embarking on another journey.</p>
<p>Circa the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Ravilar's Cloak's inhabitants discovered a bag of emeralds valued at more than 686,000 gold coins . The discovery was made in a drained cesspit near Alataz Thrindol's house. The locals quickly assumed that the treasure belonged to the wealthy merchant who's been gone from his home in the Clock for seven years at the time of discovery.</p>
