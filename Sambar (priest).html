<p>Father Sambar was a priest of Shar posing a priest of Mystra at the false Temple of Mystra in Wheloon , Cormyr , in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR .</p>
<p>Father Sambar was the first to pass through the Shadow Gate , a portal to the Plane of Shadow intended to provide a shortcut for the Sharrans' operations. However, the portal was a failure: all Sambar's clothing, skin, and flesh simply misted away as shadow. His gruesome death was seen as a sacrifice to Shar. However, the temple guard accompanying him survived, becoming a dark creature, the first of the shadow guards .</p>
<p>Sambar's bones were left heaped around the altar, the first of many, and his quarters remained empty.</p>
