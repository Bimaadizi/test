<p>Baiyosho Degi was a monk member of the Tairo in Wa around 1357 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Baiyosho was a monk from a family that had always provided generations of faithful servitors to the shogunate. Degi was assured a place as a jisha-bugyo commissioner, but shogun Matasuuri Nagahide noticed his great intelligence and fervid devotion to the Path of Enlightenment and asked him to give a series of private lectures about the Path. During those lectures, Degi explained to the shogun that the Path advocated a natural hierarchy and so Nagahide had a celestial blessing to rule.</p>
<p>Impressed, the shogun granted Baiyosho a place in the Tairo , as the only non- samurai , and proclaimed the Path the national religion of Wa.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Degli was a fleshy and expressionless individual, a loner who disliked human contact. He was a brilliant scholar and his loyalty to the shogun was absolute.</p>
