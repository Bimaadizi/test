<p>Petra , also known as Ossalurkarif amongst dragons , was a traveling painter in the midâ€“14 th century DR . She specialized in dragons.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was small, had fair hair, and was somewhat swarthy.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Petra usually spoke little. She had less than no regard for those who tried to cheat her.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Petra was a superb painter, and had mastered survival skills that served her everywhere there were dragons, having gone into volcanoes, marshes, and labyrinths to paint them. Naturally, she also spoke Draconic .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>She carried a number of rolled tubes, all of them containing pictures of different dragons that she'd sketched out or painted herself. She also carried a number of brushes , made of ox , fox , and squirrel hair; one last small paintbrush was tipped with gold . Besides a number of colors, she had a silver -wrapped ivory jar that contained a paint of indistinct color, but which she used to paint a dragon's green eyes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the middle of winter of the Year of the Helm, 1362 DR , Petra stopped at the Sembian town of Halfknot to wait for the roads to dry out. While at the town, she repainted the signs for a few businesses: the town baker, butcher, and hostler. She agreed to do the sign of the Dragon Defeated , a local inn, too, for a few meals. Varney , the owner of the Dragon Defeated, accepted, and commissioned her a sign of a dead green dragon , with a princess, and three regulars at his tavern as the slayers: Wyrmbait Nix , Silvenestri Silver , and Badger Bates .</p>
<p>Tendays later, on her last night at the town, she spoke up during the nightly tales at the Dragon Defeated, which had a prize for the most awe-inspiring story. She revealed she was a painter of dragons, and that she knew of them. Showing the people at the tavern some samples of her work, she explained that she'd traveled the width and breadth of the Realms to look at dragons and paint them. She considered she'd shown more of dragons than anyone in the entire season, and that she should be given the prize for the evening. Petra related that by 1362 DR, she had painted a hundred or so green dragons , talked to white dragons , and mentioned that she'd drawn copper dragons at the High Moor , and all manner of the best-known dragons. Badger Bates, however, demanded that only a painting of Malaeragoth , of which she'd not shown, would make it worth giving her the money. Despite her insistence that she'd painted Malaeragoth from life once, and that he'd sent a servant to steal the painting afterwards, she agreed to do it.</p>
<p>No matter how much detail she added, however, Badger was left unsatisfied, demanding to see the eyes of Malaeragoth painted, and then painted in the correct shade. She had some apprehensions and warned them, but still painted a picture of Malaeragoth scrying on the inn. After completing her picture, she claimed the prize, and left quickly, before Malaeragoth somehow entered the tavern through her painting and rampaged inside the building, destroying it completely, and killing Badger Bates in the process.</p>
<p>She later relayed through Wyrmbait Nix that she was sorry for what happened, but that Bates shouldn't have cheated on the bet, and that she'd go further east, to study landwyrms .</p>
