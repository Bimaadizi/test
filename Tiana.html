<p>She had a caretaking role over the young Amaranth, who knew her as "Mistress Tiana".</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 1460s DR, Anaranth's life was threatened by her wrathful and jealous elder half-sister, the High Lady Ordalf , and so Tiana conspired with Valeanne and Shamasar to save Princess Amaranth by kidnapping her from Karador and transporting her to the court of Erliza Daressin on Snowdown via hippogriff from Crane Point . Tiana had gone ahead to Snowdown when the plot was executed, but it did not succeed after someone betrayed them to the le Shay. Before her death at the hands of her pursuers, Valeanne revealed to the nine-year-old Amaranth that they were trying to get her to Tiana on Snowdown, but lied and claimed that the relocation would only last for half a month. Regardless, the young girl did not make it, and disappeared for ten years before finally being found on Moray .</p>
