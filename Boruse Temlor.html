<p>Boruse Temlor was the head cleric of Cyric at the Citadel of the Raven in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Boruse was a cold and remote individual. His main concern was maintaining faith in Cyric in the most remote outpost. Boruse had a passably good relationship with Kandar Milinal , but Kandar was contemptuous of Boruse for his lack of interest in plots and schemes.</p>
