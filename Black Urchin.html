<p>Black Urchin was a type of enchanted shield forged in the Underdark in the likeness of blackblood urchins .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Black Urchin was designed by the duergars to resemble a blackblood urchin, a species of venomous shellfish found in the seas of the Underdark. Such shields were made of iron and often appeared black and strained with rust. The shield's front was covered in rusted barbs. Each time the shield bashed a target or an attacker pricked themselves, its barbs injected the target with harmful toxins.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , one Black Urchin shield was wielded by Harhord Dorm , a duergar bodyguard of Barud Barzam , who was placed in charge of an old duergar stronghold in the River Caves , where the Black Raven River emerged and ran south in northwest Faerûn .</p>
