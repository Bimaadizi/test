<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , while working for Orthil Voldovan , Thorst was promoted to caravan drover. Orthil also knew he had been between Shandril Shessair and the burned body of the late guard Storstil , which helped him figure out Shandril hadn't been the killer. He had a brief, yet productive talk with Shandril himself shortly after. He fought alongside Shandril in protecting their wagon afterwards. He was badly injured during the fight, but spoke up in Shandril's defense, as she resorted to spellfire to fight back against his assailants and protect him.</p>
