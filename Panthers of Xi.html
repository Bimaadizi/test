<p>The Panthers of Xi were a ninja clan based in the town of Xi in Koryo around 1357 DR . They controlled the Vorkani Mountains between Xi and the Malu River in the east.</p>
<p>Their clanmaster was Lin Goh , the wielder of the black kumade . The Panthers adopted this as a symbol, and left a black-painted kumade (a type of weaponized rake) as a sign of their handiwork or passing.</p>
