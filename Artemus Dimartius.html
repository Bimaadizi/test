<p>Artemus Dimartius was a human swashbuckler living in Waterdeep in the mid 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He had a full, yet finely trimmed beard.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>A swaggering buffon, he was far better at telling tall tales in the Waterdhavian bars than actually committing glorious acts of daring-do. Nonetheless, he was a man with a good heart, and he at least fought duels against purse-stealing thieves .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He wielded an enchanted +1 rapier in one hand and a main-gauche in the other. A ring of protection , and an exceptional cloak of displacement , that also attracted all electricity-based spells in the manner of a lightning rod, kept him safe, while his boots of striding and springing allowed him to prance around in a most "heroic" fashion.</p>
