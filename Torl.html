<p>Torl was an independent port city located on the north-western shore of the Vilhon Reach .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Torl was established in Year of the Barbed Wind, 50 DR on the north-western bank of the Vilhon Reach.</p>
<p>As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , Torl remained a port city, but by that time gold mines, which were the main attraction of the town, had been exhausted for the most part. The mined gold continued to flow through the town's ports, but its amounts were minuscule. In 1370 DR , rumors of a new rich gold vein in Aphrunn started to surface, promising a busy future for Torl, if the rumors were indeed true.</p>
