<p>King Sternhelm , more commonly known by his moniker â€“ The Mad King , was a dwarvish ruler of the great stronghold of Keldegonn in the Dragonbone Vale of the Sword Mountains long before the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Many centuries before the 15 th century DR, King Sternhelm was a ruler who wanted to leave a great legacy for his people; however, that was not to be. One day, he noticed a glimmer of something valuable while riding past an ancient ruin. Curious, the king followed the sine and discovered a bejeweled chalice peaking from under some rubble. The chalice did not look like it was forged by a dwarvish hand, so the king took it with him as a precious exotic souvenir. Using the chalice as a drinking cup, Sternhelm began being plagued by ghostly whispers. Unbeknownst to him, the chalice was an ancient Netherese ritual vessel from the ruin that held the dark artifact , the Scaleblight Mythallar . The curse got worse, and the spirits from the Shadowfell slowly drove the monarch to madness. When the Mad King perished, his own spirit was absorbed by the chalice.</p>
<p>Every individual who used the chalice became possessed by the Mad King's spirit. In the late 15 th century DR, an unlucky dwarvish adventurer who ventured into the Dragonbone Vale fell victim to Sternhelm's ghost. Posessed, the mad dwarf became a danger to the locals, and a bounty was put on his head. It was presumed that the adventurer was slain, but the chalice's fate remained unknown.</p>
