<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , accidentally pulled the cursed book title The Scrivener's Tale from the vaults of Candlekeep and offered it to a group of adventurers by mistake. While this was an honest mistake, Ramilir's error led to a member of the group suffering the curse of the scrivener's mark , that gradually caused them to transform into a petrified being of shadow glass.</p>
