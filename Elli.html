<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR , a group of adventurers from the city of Ravens Bluff journeyed to the plane of Ysgard in search of the legendary Well of Mimir , having been instructed by the city's Ministry of Art to do so in order to learn how a powerful githyanki artifact known only as the Great Machine could be destroyed.</p>
<p>While traveling in Jotunheim, they met Habrok Icecaster and, after proving their worth to him by slaying a bulette , he brought them to the beer-hall Okalnir. Brimir , sensing the giants of his hall were indifferent towards the adventurers, proposed a competition of four tests to lighten the mood. He was even willing to wager three magic items if the adventurers would wager three comparable permanent or major charged items. The items he wagered included a Svartalfheim cloak , a horn of Valhalla , and a great war maul known as Grungir's hammer .</p>
<p>The fourth and final test was to be a wrestling match. However, when the giants looked amongst themselves to choose a champion they came to conclude that it would be unfair to match the adventurers against any of their warriors. Eventually they called upon Brimir's own mother, Elli, to be the giant champion of wrestling.</p>
