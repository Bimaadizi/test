<p>Honeyhollow Fortress was a sprite encampment found in the domain of Thither in the Feywild .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The fortress appeared to comprise a single tree, within which the sprites made their home.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point, a giant harengon and human riding aboard an owlbear -driven carriage attacked Honeyhollow, by ramming their conveyance into the fortress at full force. The valiant sprites defended their home with treated arrows , incapacitating the invaders and allowing them to be restrained for interrogation.</p>
<p>Upon dutiful questions, the sprites of Honeyhollow realized the interlopers were on a quest of great importance. The human woman was heartbroken over the loss of her brother, who had been captured by the malevolent hag Granny Nightshade . The sprites of Honeyhollow made a bargain with their captives: they would be set free, so long as they vowed to secure certain rare material components from the hag, when they broke into her lair. Sir Paddington led the duo out of Honeyhollow and into the domain of Granny Nightshade.</p>
