<p>The Hebika River , or the Serpent River, was the mysterious northernmost of the three major waterways that crossed the Malatran Plateau in Kara-Tur , often navigated by the Malatran tribes via thatch rafts.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Hebika River began on the Fire Mountain at the center of the Malatran Plateau and cascaded down its northern slopes. From there, it snaked north all the way to the Plateau's edge, where it fed the wild and dangerous Dokuba Swamp , that, in turn, sent the Hebika River's waters down, plummeting off of the Malatran Plateau into the Malatra region of Kara-Tur. The fast-moving river was hard to cross in most places, apart from the areas closer to the Fire Mountain, where the waters were slightly calmer. In some places, the river could be crossed via vine swinging.</p>
<p>The journey between the foothills of the Fire Mountain and the Dokuba Swamp took almost a week on foot.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>The northernmost shores of the Hebika River were often visited by the lizardfolk of the Dokuba Swamp, with whom the tribes of the Living Jungle held ancient animosity. Despite the oldest generations of the Nubari tribes telling stories of lizardfolk raids, the communities forged a cautious peace in the face of the Tamara invasion of the Living Jungle in the late 14 th century DR . Another group of notable inhabitants of the river shores were pteramen – territorial creatures of the jungle who delivered death from above.</p>
<p>A tribe of reformed Nubari cannibals – Kukalatu , claimed the southeastern shorelines of the Hebika River's biggest bend – northwest to northeast, north of the Fire Mountain.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of New Peoples, Malatran calendar, a group of heroes of the Living Jungle were sent by the Wise Ones Nubari tribe to confront the great evil that lived on the Hebika River's shores near the Dokuba Swamp. The said evil was the Nubari named Sombari , who was exiled eight years prior. Somari took control of a colony of pteramen and plotted the death of Arkari of the Wise Ones.</p>
