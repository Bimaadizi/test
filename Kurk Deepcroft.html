<p>Kurk Deepcroft was a Sharran infiltrator from the hidden Cloister of Sombre Embrace in the city of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , during the Absolute crisis , Kurk Deepcroft served the Mother Superior Viconia De Vir in the House of Grief , located in the Lower City . Caldan Darkwood was hand-picked by the Mother Superior to lead a band of Sharran infiltrators to steal a powerful atrifact she thought to be a weapon – the Astral Prism . The group also included Buddug Vriss – an expert in close combat, Kurk Deepcroft – a lockpicker , Dreena Covely – a language expert, and Shadowheart – the group's healer . Every member of the group was considered to be utterly expendable and, before embarking on the quest, every member of the group had their memories taken by Shar to ensure nothing would be revealed to the enemy were they captured and tortured.</p>
<p>Eventually, the group was successful in stealing the artifact, but Shadowheart was the only survivor.</p>
