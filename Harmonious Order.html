<p>The Harmonious Order was a group of personable clerics and paladins of Milil , who traveled Faer√ªn accomplishing great feats worthy of being shared by poets and story-tellers. They often were egoistical and overly sure of themselves.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>To ensure their exploits would be immortalized by song or story, members of the order would encourage bards , tuneservants and troubadours to accompany them on their romantic and glorious quests.</p>
<p>Beyond their adventures, the official duties of the Harmonious Order were to guard the Lord of Song's holy sites and perform benevolent deeds for the people in his name.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This order of priests and knights was fairly old. Many famous bards' tales, however exaggerated in their re-telling, owe their origins to deeds performed by these devout priests and champions of Milil.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>Paladins of the Harmonious Order were called Harmonious Knights . They were granted special powers by their deity, such as the ability to use songs to inspire their allies.</p>
<p>In addition to clerics and paladins, the order also included some fighters and bards .</p>
