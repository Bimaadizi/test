<p>Xixecals were colossal creatures of elemental ice, walking glaciers born from the deities who personify evil, cold, and chaos.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A xixecal is a giant creature of 100 feet (30 meters). It resembled a glacier of vaguely humanoid shape, surrounded by unnatural cold and blasting frigid winds that kicked off a storm of the ages.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>They possessed magical abilities to unleash a collection of spells at will: blasphemy , cone of cold , desecrate , greater dispelling , dominate monster , hold person , improved invisibility , unholy aura , and wall of ice . A xixecal could also cast haste and meteor swarm five times per day each. They also possessed a powerful breath weapon that unleashed a deadly 300 feet (91 meters) long cone of cold thrice a day. Additionally, a xixecal could summon an old white dragon to its aid five times per day.</p>
<p>A xixecal was unaffected by form-altering magics and effects, such as polymorphing or petrification . They were also immune to the draining of life and powers, death magic , mind-meddling, and cold. However, a xixecal was vulnerable to fire, which also prevented them from regenerating damage.</p>
<p>Xixecal also possessed truesight and blindsight within 500 feet (150 meters). They communicated via telepathy that reached 1,000 feet (300 meters).</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Xixecals first mode of attack was its howling winds that froze and slowed everything around them. Those creatures strong enough to survive the supernatural cold were met with xixecals's gigantic feet, fists, bites, and claws. Each successful physical attack made by a xixecal resulted in the loss of constitution, which was drained from the victims and temporarily empowered a xixecal.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Xixecals often were solitary creatures, sometimes accompanied by white dragons .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Xixecals were unwanted products of relationships or trysts between evil deities of ice. They were imprisoned within glaciers of black ice after being created, waiting for their chance to unleash the destructive fury of winter on everything and everyone in their way.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A thousand years before the 14 th century DR , the goddess of winter, Auril, and Targus , or Targos, the god of war, shared a relationship that resulted in xixecal Arctus , the Walking Winter. When the god of war lost his throne in the north, Auril decided that neither Targus nor Arctus deserved her lore. The goddess buried the xixecal underneath the Reghed Glacier , where he was left trapped and forgotten. With centuries passing, xixecal became consumed by endless rage and driven half-mad by his imprisonment.</p>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Auril decided to use her unwanted progeny to lay waste to Icewind Dale and, when it was conquered by her neverending winter, expand her influence south. Auril led Iceblood to serve Arctus and assemble a force of creatures of tundra to conquer the Ten-Towns , and she resurrected her Chosen Lysan to shepherd Arctus. Subsequently, Arctus was freed from his prison and the Walking Winter descended on the town of Targos . Arctus crushed the town's walls and faced a group of adventurers led by the Hero of Neverwinter . Subsequently, the godling was defeated, and his essence returned to the Reghed Glacier, back into the prison.</p>
