<table border='1'><tr><th>Type</th><td>Hall</td></tr></table><br>
<p>Spelldown Hall was a cavernous location. Duels before Mystra were held there for centuries.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The ruined hall had some of its stone converted into glassy flows, with glowing energies embedded in it. There was some rubble, and stalactites of sorts on the ceiling. The hall also had doors.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Ritual duels between mages had been held in the location for centuries, and it showed extensive scarring for it. It was possible for duelists to claim Right of subsumption before Mystra and the Mages Arcane on such duels, which were one-on-one per the rules. The doors were sealed with blue fire when a duel was in progress.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point prior to 1372Â DR , the Hall was used in a battle where Elminster Aumar was challenged by a lich , who, in violation of the rules, had brought allies: a death tyrant with some of its eyes replaced by jaws, a gargoyle with a black, flaming sword, a naga , and a drow with two spellspun daggers. The lich attempted to claim right of subsumption anyway. Rather than meeting his spells with spells, Elminster struck them all down with silver fire called down directly from Mystra , causing extensive damage to the other end of the hall.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>There were restless spirits, bound and helpless, in the hall.</p>
