<p>Sardines were a variety of fish that could be found in parts of Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These fish bore a resemblance to taece and had a taste that was comparable to that of the Savage Frontier 's silverlings , albeit lacking the latter's smoky aftertaste and hints of mushrooms .</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Cured sardines, usually achieved by packing them in oil much like silverfins , were durable foods that would not spoil over the winter or during long trips. Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue sold sardines as such under its "Aurora's Larder" section at a price of 4 gold pieces per 1 pound (450 grams).</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>They could be found along the Sword Coast and in the waters of Calimshan , where they were usually dredged up tightly by nets in large groups.</p>
