<p>Kellen was a trusted sailor aboard the Vigilant , a ship that traveled between the Sword Coast and the Chultan Peninsula circa 1374 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 1374 DR , Captain Lastri Kassireh and the Vigilant sailed from the Sword Coast to the Chultan nation of Samarach. The voyage was cursed with bad luck and numerous strange occurrences. Food supplies were mysteriously spoiled; freshwater barrels ruptured; one of the crew, a sailor, got drunk and drowned; a famous writer aboard the ship, Volothamp Geddarm , almost got poisoned as his poisoned soup took the life of Joquin ; and a fellow sailor, Rienur , noticed new ropes becoming strangely frayed.</p>
<p>The bad luck was a sabotage by a yuan-ti spy aboard. Kellen likely fell victim to the snake man's plans. The sailor was thought to have gotten drunk and plummeted over the ship's sides into the Trackless Sea . He drowned before anyone could notice.</p>
