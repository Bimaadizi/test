<p>Sildar Hallwinter was a retired knight from Neverwinter and later a member of the Town Council of Phandalin in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sildar was nearly 50 years old in 1491 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Despite his restrained and almost cold mannerisms and speech, Sildar was kind-hearted and sincere, although lacking in confidence and charisma. He was generally risk-averse, although still willing to enter into potentially dangerous situations when no one else dared. He wished to see the town of Phandalin prosper and to ensure that innocents—even fools—never came to any harm. He was a fan of "quaint" inns.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As a citizen and later town councilor of Phandalin , Sildar's role was to ensure the safety of the town's mining and timber operations, and to see to it that nothing interfered with them. In this way, he strove to help elevate Phandalin to a position of relevance in the region's trade and commerce.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was a loyal member of the Lords' Alliance , and had close ties to both Neverwinter and Waterdeep . He was a friend of treasure hunter Gundren Rockseeker and of Neverwinterian noblewoman Ilsa Wisemantlem .</p>
<p>He was a member of the knightly Hallwinter family and had an adopted daughter named Alana .</p>
<p>As a member of the town council of Phandalin, he was well respected and trusted by the townsfolk. He seemed to get along well with fellow councilors Trilena Stonehill and Halia Thornton , but not so much with councilor Harbin Wester , whom he saw as fundamentally corrupt.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sildar originally hailed from Neverwinter. In his younger days, Sildar was a soldier and he earned himself a place of honor among the Griffon Cavalry of Waterdeep before retiring.</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR , Sildar was working as a sellsword. He set off to Phandalin from Neverwinter to escort Gundren Rockseeker, who had recently rediscovered the Wave Echo Cave . Sildar had his own reasons for visiting Phandalin, and wished to find out what was happening with his fellow agent of the Lord's Alliance, Iarno Albrek . He also wanted to help Gundren and his brothers re-open the mine, as well as establish Phandalin as a place of prosperity, as it once was. However, on the way, he was ambushed and captured by the Cragmaw tribe and he was taken to the Cragmaw Hideout , where he was watched over by Yeemik . Hallwinter's equipment was stripped from him, and sent to Cragmaw Castle .</p>
<p>Following his rescue from the Cragmaws by adventurers , Sildar's confidence in himself was badly shaken, and he retired from his martial lifestyle in Phandalin. Despite his lack of confidence, he continued to stay in shape and quickly became respected within the community as an honorable and brave man. When Phandalin formed a town council not long after his retirement had started, he was elected as one of the three councilors.</p>
<p>Early in his tenure as councilor, his adopted daughter Alana disappeared into the Crooked Forest . Unable to go after her for fear that his disappearance would cause anxiety in Phandalin, he hired adventurers to find her and to return with her discretely.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Duplicitous Courtier, 1496 DR , Sildar campaigned against Harbin Wester in Phandalin's first mayoral election. He was generally lacking in the swagger and oratory ability expected of an aspiring politician, but was motivated to push against Harbin's corrupt and self-serving agenda.</p>
