<p>The Moonshae Chronicles were the personal diaries of the sage Flamsterd .</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>The diaries documented the sage's life among the Ffolk of the Moonshae Isles , about whose settlements and deeds he had conducted extensive research. In addition, he included the entire text of the famed spellbook known as The Wizard's Workbook within.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally penned in installments, Flamsterd shared the diaries with his friend Elminster , sending copies of the entries from his island . This ceased after Flamsterd's disappearance in the Year of the Hooded Falcon, 1291 DR , following which Elminster thought him to be dead. Elminster would go on to share some of the spells from The Wizard's Workbook that had been included in one of the installments.</p>
<p>A three-volume compendium of the diaries was ultimately published circa the 1340s DR , a copy of which had found its way into the library at Candlekeep as of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
