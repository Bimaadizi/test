<p>Jhaamdathan was the language of the old Jhaamdathan Empire.</p>
<p>Jhaamdathan was also known as " Old Chondathan ", and as this name suggests, it was the direct precursor of the Chondathan language . The original "Common" tongue, Thorass ("Old Common"), came about as a mixture of Jhaamdathan and Alzhedo , and thus, Jhaamdathan was a progenitor of modern Common as well.</p>
<p>Jhaamdathan's progenitors included Jotun , the language of giants.</p>
