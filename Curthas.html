<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>One of Curthas's fellow guards at his post was Halglond . They both served Klandaerlas Glymril .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the night of the destruction of Glymril Gard late in the Year of Mistmaidens, 764 DR , Curthas and Halglond were protecting the bridge between the Master's tower and the keep's battlements. They saw a strange mistlike entity that swept through the air, tinkling with a sound like bells . The entity drew the attention of the Master, who came out with a wand to menace it. Their battle was quick, and the Master died almost on the spot; Curthas and Halglond were killed by the ensuing collapse of Glymril Gard, as the Master's spells died with him.</p>
