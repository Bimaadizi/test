<p>Ssar Tarell was a drow merchant who owned a store in the south-eastern region of the Menzoberranzan bazaar in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Menzoberranzan merchant could be found in her self-titled store. Her store contained many magical goods displayed around the premises. However, Ssar Tarell was known for her information, not wares. For vital information on the rising and falling of drow nobility, some would pay with their life. She was in love with Maznafein , and told an adventuring party to visit Sorcere in order to acquire a scroll from Jalynfein , in order to undo his drider curse. In return, she promised to tell the companions of the prisoners from their home village.</p>
<p>After the drider curse had been undone, she kept her promise and told the companions to visit her informant, the wizard Grumsznar of House Fey-Branche . Upon the return of the companions, she opened up a portal between themselves and Vermulean , the gem enchanter, to discuss the Gem of Lolth .</p>
