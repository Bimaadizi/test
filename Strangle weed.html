<p>Strangle weeds were an intelligent species of kelp.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This species of plant was indistinguishable from normal seaweed. It typically grew in 3​ to ​12 feet (0.91​ to ​3.7 meters) oval patches. Their friends grew to be 7​ to ​12 feet (2.1​ to ​3.7 meters) in length.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This species of plant had a basic animal level of intelligence.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>These plants would detect vibrations in the water and reach out towards their source. Their fronds would wrap and entangle themselves around prey, then attempt to pull prey down beneath the water. There their would slowly be constricted and drown.</p>
<p>Creatures that were unconscious or calmly floating in the water had a greater chance of escaping the grasp of strangle weeds than those who frantically thrashed about.</p>
