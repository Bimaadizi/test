<p>A wagon was a four-wheeled, open-topped vehicle hauled behind a pair of horses or other beasts of burden, used to transport goods overland. The person controlling a wagon was called a teamster .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>An ideal wagon was about 15 feet (4.6 meters) long and about 10 feet (3 meters) wide. The average model weighed about 400 pounds (180 kilograms) and was designed to carry heavy loads. The usual speed of travel for a wagon was about 2 miles per hour (3.2 kilometers per hour) over smooth terrain, which, given an average amount of daylight hours, amounted to 16 miles per day (26 kilometers per day). Animals that could move faster than horses could of course make a wagon travel faster.</p>
<p>A wagon sold for about 35 gold pieces in most economies of Faerûn , including the harness for hitching it to the drawing animals. Teamsters typically offered their services as wagon drivers for 3 silver pieces per day.</p>
<p>Some wagons were equipped with a heavy or light catapult as a weapon. The craftsmen of Lantan had developed wagons with suspension systems to minimize jerky rides or special wagon wheels that could be repaired in sections. These had found popularity in mainland Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Merchants often came to the various trade fairs of Faerûn, selling goods from their wagons. Wagons were sometimes also used by armies to carry siege engines to battle.</p>
<p>In the city of Secomber , blocking a doorway or alleyway with one's wagon was a crime punishable by fine and with an edict forbidding the driving of wagon in the city again for a set time period. Parking in front of a city gate would earn a teamster a night in jail.</p>
