<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point in the decades prior to 1372 DR , Ravaedrin fought The Simbul and survived; unknown to him, she'd thrust some of her blood into his body, where it had lodged, making him vulnerable to her blood ring spell later on. She used the spell in 1372 DR , calling him to her service in Avernus . She later ended the summon, returning him to wherever he had been.</p>
