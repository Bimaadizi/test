<p>Potions of treasure finding were a type of potion that aided their imbibers in discovering treasure.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When consumed, these potions provided their drinker with a sort of "directional sense" in regards to treasure, enabling them to feel or sense the general direction of the nearest mass, but not its exact location. The only substances this sense could not penetrate through were special magical wards and walls lined with lead . This mass had to be within 240 yards (220 meters) to be detected and its overall weight needed to be equal to at least 10,000 copper pieces or 100 gems .</p>
<p>What these potions classified as "treasure" was solely gems , jewelry , and metals considered valuable, such as copper , silver , electrum , gold , and platinum . Those considered "worthless" would not be detected by these potions. Magical items were also not considered valuable by a potion of treasure finding unless their body consisted in part of some form of valuable gem or metal.</p>
