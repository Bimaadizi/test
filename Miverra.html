<h2>History</h2>
<p>Miverra was a priestess of the Promenade of the Dark Maiden .</p>
<p>In 1377 DR , she was sent to ask for an audience with the Conclave of Sshamath , rulers of the city of Sshamath .</p>
<p>However Q'arlynd Melarn , a fellow devotee of Eilistraee, recommended to Miverra to trust only Seldszar Elpragh , the Master of the College of Divination and his patron, when discussing about a strange magical phenomena that had affected both wizards and priests.</p>
<p>So Miverra and Seldszar spoke about the magic phenomena that involved disturbance in the faerzress spreading from the main temple of Kiaransalee . At last they decided that a joint-force of Eilistraee's priests and wizards of the Divination's College would scout the temple of Kiaransalee.</p>
