<p>Qilder Yarven was the Magister for two months, one in 1317 DR and one in 1318 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Knowing his own magic to be weak, Qilder Yarven preferred instead to strike first with his wands at every opportunity.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He possessed at least seven wands which he used for attack.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally Holbert Gruth, Qilder Yarven was an apprentice to the archmage Maermadrar of Sheirtalar , until he stole two spellbooks and a coffer full of wands . He came up with the name by combining the names of two warriors in a tavern he stopped at during his desperate flight. He hid in the Border Kingdoms for some time, always striking first at mages he encountered. He continued in this habit until Elminster practically made him Magister by placing him in the middle of the fight between Scsilda Starshield and Orten Imdrar , whom the apprentice managed to slay with some help.</p>
<p>As the Magister, he challenged a few archmages, emboldened by his power. He succeeded twice; his third challenge, Maldiglas Turntower , turned out to be more powerful than he could handle. He lost that duel, and his life.</p>
