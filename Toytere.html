<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR , Toytere ordered the capture of the powerful spellscarred wizard Myrin Darkdance with the intent of turning her over to the Coin Spinners gang for payment. Realizing they couldn't hold a mage as powerful as Myrin, they led her to believe she was the new leader of the gang.</p>
<p>Toytere was bitten by a rat infected with the Fury plague and slowly began to develop symptoms of the disease, becoming increasingly aggressive and irrational. Later, Toytere and the Rats turned on Myrin and he was killed by Sithe during a brawl at the Rats' headquarters.</p>
