<h2>Powers</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tsaa Olo's Disaster was created some years before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR . It was named after the yuan-ti term "tsaa olo," which meant "potential slaves" – humans, who were considered yuan-ti's most troublesome enemies. Its potent magics were created especially to be used against humans. In 1374 DR, Tsaa Olo's Disaster was in the scaly hands of the Serpentlord Hal'seh, who served the interloper deity Zehir in the Temple of the World Serpent on the border between Chult and Samarach . After Hal'seh was slain by a band of heroes who aided merchant princess Sa'Sani , Tsaa Olo's Disaster left the possession of the Serpentlord and its further story remain unrecorded.</p>
