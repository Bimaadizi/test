<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Maeve had a blush, fair skin, and hazel eyes. She wore her light brown hair tightly gathered into a bun.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , as the Cult of the Absolute planted its roots in Baldur's Gate and ravaged the Western Heartlands , Felogyr's Fireworks shop fell under the cult's sway. Its proprietor, Avery Sonshal , was made into a True Soul and used the shop as a front for the cult's terrorist activities. During that time, Maeve was employed as a Feloguard, standing guard of the shop's second floor and its clerk Tamara, who serviced "friends of Felogyr," selling them the shop's more dangerous weaponized stock, like bombs and smokepowder arrows . Maeve knowingly or unknowingly also guarded the shop's third floor that was off-limits to all but the Banite members of the Cult of the Absolute.</p>
