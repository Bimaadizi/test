<p>Glaives were a type of reach weapon in the pole arm family.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Glaives were pole arms that, in their basic form, were long wooden poles mounted with a sword-like cutting blade. The blade was often augmented with a back spike, perpendicular to the blade or angled forward.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>Glaives were two-handed melee weapons with a 10 feet (3 meters) reach. Because it was a pole arm, it couldn't be used to attack adjacent foes. They were most effective in large numbers in a phalanx, or when they could be set against a charging opponent. Even though the tip of the blade was sharp and the back spike could be swung to penetrate armor, the glaive was considered a slashing weapon.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Glaives first became available in the Netheril Empire in 2171 NY (−1688 DR) .</p>
