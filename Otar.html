<p>Otar was a young High Forest orc chieftain of the Grayvale in the late 14 th century DR and a Green Regent , a Chosen of Mielikki , from 1372 DR onward.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On Shieldmeet of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Otar led a band of fellow orcs from the High Forest into Loudwater 's Risen Moon Market with the intention of taking part in the ceremony held by the Circle of the Stag druids to choose the next Green Regent. Though onlookers were shocked by the orc's presence, he drank the Greendraught without issue and was accepted as one of the Scions of the Green Regent . Then, during an overnight vigil in the High Forest undertaken by the Scions, Otar was met by a unicorn and led away, and ultimately granted the mantle of Green Regent by the goddess Mielikki herself. The next day, when Otar walked out of the High Forest the next day displaying the marks of the Green Regent, there was horror and outrage in Loudwater. The city's elven nobility were particularly appalled and openly rejected Otar and accused the Circle of the Stag of deceit, even blasphemy, claiming it was evidence of the ceremony being tainted or sabotaged. A few even doubted the validity of all the Scions, which nearly everyone rejected as ridiculous. Notoriously, family patriarch Halitan Phelaniityr vowed to rectify the situation before the Grayvale became, in his words, a "cesspool of bestial orcish scum." Fearing violence might follow, the orcs, druids, and new Green Regent returned to the High Forest, leaving the Scions leaderless and people in Loudwater angry or afraid or else just waiting and wondering what Mielikki had in store.</p>
<p>In the months after, rumors flourished, with some claiming Otar and his orcs were in hiding while plotting to attack and sack the city, but others insisted they guarded the city in secret, and still others that he had been murdered by the same anti-orc killer operating around the Red Boar Tavern , who might be a Mielikkian set on "making things right". Otar was, for all intents and purposes, missing or in hiding for the rest of the year. In truth, he was on a quest to learn more about his destiny and on a holy mission for Mielikki. High Forest orcs heard he'd traveled as far as Waterdeep , visiting the Inn of the Dripping Dagger .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A large orc with gray skin, Otar bore the telltale markings of the Green Regent, in the form of intricate symbols of emerald hue that ran and entwined like ivy all over his body. These would include the holy symbol of Mielikki, a unicorn's head appearing like a magical glyph, upon his forehead. It glowed with an emerald hue. He had a scar across his right forehead and cheek.</p>
