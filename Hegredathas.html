<p>The Hegredathas was the most well-known written history of the Delimbiyr Vale in the Savage Frontier , published some time before 1372 DR .</p>
<p>The Hegredathas related the story that the master dwarven builder Iirikos Stoneshoulder was commissioned by an Illuskan wizard named Silifrey the Spraystrider to build the Granite Tower . However, Silifrey was rumored to practice dark magic and Iirikos's elven friends warned and pleaded with him not to. Ignoring them, leaving them bewildered by his choice, Iirikos built the Granite Tower swiftly using summoned elementals . But he also installed magical wards that would activate and destroy any who worked evil magic within its walls. Silifrey was slain before a month had passed.</p>
