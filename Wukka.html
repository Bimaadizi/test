<p>Wukka trees , sometimes called wazingo trees , were a variety of magical tree that grew in the jungles of Chult .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The nuts of the wukka tree were the size of a human fist, and a wukka tree often contained anywhere from two to twelve nuts. Whenever one of these nuts was shaken, it made a rattling noise and began to glow with a bright, magical light for about one minute. This light was bright enough to illuminate everything within a 20‑foot (6.1‑meter) radius, at least dimly. Cracking a nut caused it to lose this property.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Wukka trees grew in groves and were considered to be rare in the Chultan jungle. A grove of them was known to grow along a stream at the foot of a hill just outside the ruins of Mezro .</p>
<p>They made excellent homes for jaculi , su-monsters , and zorbos . As many as a dozen zorbos could live in a single wukka tree.</p>
