<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Royal Vagabonds were a secret clan in service to the Shou Emperor. All members of the clan were ninja . They were not an official part of the government but still reported to the Minister of State Security and the Chief Imperial Censor . They did most of the difficult missions that the Emperor ordered. Nobody outside the clan could positively identify a vagabond. The only positive means of identification was a magical sigil borne on the chest of each man.</p>
