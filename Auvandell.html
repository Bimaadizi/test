<h2>Description</h2>

Goats and sheep were the main resource for local agriculture, while apple and cherry orchards were cultivated on the slopes of the hills. Two small mines in the nearby hills were the primary business of Auvandell. A foundryman produced copper , lead and iron ingots, which were sent to Sundabar on heavy carts pulled by teams of oxen.</p>
