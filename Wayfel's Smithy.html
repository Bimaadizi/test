<p>Wayfel's Smithy was a lowâ€“quality forge that operated in the Farmers' Quarter of Daggerford during the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The smithy was located in the northwest corner of Daggerford at the junction of Wall Street and Horse Way .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The only thing lower than Wayfel 's prices was the quality of his work. He did not come close to competing with the fine pieces forged at Derval's Bright Blade .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time around the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR Wayfel was hired to construct a tower that overlooked Daggerford's River Gate. Unfortunately, he failed to anchor the structure to the solid rock beneath the Delimbiyr River . When the river flooded, the tower collapsed.</p>
<p>Wayfel was not offered any construction contracts after that fiasco.</p>
<h2>Lore</h2>
<p>When referring to the blacksmith Cromach , locals said his work was "as shaky as Wayfel's best."</p>
