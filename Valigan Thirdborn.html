<p>Valigan Thirdborn was a lesser deity of anarchy in ancient Jhaamdath , whose rise to power in the Year of Mournful Monuments, −269 DR directly coincided with that of Exarch Thelasand IV , a bloodthirsty advisor who urged the emperor of Jhaamdath into greater conflict with the neighboring elves . After those same elves brought about Jhaamdath's fall shortly after, the region fell into lawlessness. It was pacified and Valigan was killed during the Procession of Justice ( −247 DR to −238 DR ).</p>
