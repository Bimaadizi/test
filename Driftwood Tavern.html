<p>The Driftwood Tavern was a fine inn and tavern, which also doubled as a museum, located in the Blacklake District of Neverwinter in the late 14 th to late 15 th centuries DR . In the latter half of 1400s DR, it was run by Madame Rosene .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It stood within a partially collapsed tower.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The Driftwood Tavern was decorated with curios, salvage, and relics from across Neverwinter from before its devastation. An old statue from a beloved fountain stood in the corners, the planter boxes of a Neverwintan wineseller were mounted on the walls and filled with flowers, ornate doors taken from the rubble doubled as fine tables, the privy door sported the doorknob and knocker from a noble's house, and unbroken panes of stained glass were hung from the ceiling and loaded with hundreds of candles for use as chandeliers. It all appeared tasteful rather than tacky. The patrons of the Driftwood Tavern believed this was a proper way to honor the past of the City of Skilled Hands. Rosene would reject any offered items she didn't think were worthy.</p>
<p>The walls were thick, the better for privacy.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>It catered to a richer clientele than other similar establishments in Neverwinter, and its patrons were largely long-term patrons, citizens, and friends. Both Neverwintan and Waterdhavian nobles, including Margasters , could be seen in its common room. The mercenaries from Mintarn avoided it in favor of cheaper establishments. In addition, visitors to Neverwinter would come here to look at the Neverwintan relics and learn about the old city.</p>
<p>It was a place of peaceful contemplation, not for raucous revelry but such things were not unknown there either.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Drinks, meals, and rooms were quite expensive in the Driftwood Tavern around 1479 DR . One could also hear stories about old Neverwinter from Madame Rosen, at least after they'd paid for their drinks and meal.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Driftwood Tavern was built years before 1385 DR , and it survived both the Spellplague and the eruption of Mount Hotenow nearly unscathed, and this was a point of pride for the staff. Following the eruption in the Year of Knowledge Unearthed, 1451 DR , Madame Rosene opened the inn up a shelter for refugees. The Driftwood Tavern even served as a meeting place and a city hall of sorts, in the turbulent years before Dagult Neverember reclaimed Neverwinter.</p>
<p>Around 1479 DR, the Driftwood Tavern was a meeting place and unofficial headquarters for members of the Graycloaks .</p>
<p>In the Year of Dwarvenkind Reborn, 1488 DR , Regis visited the Driftwood Tavern the same night as Bronkyn Stoneshaft and his dwarves stood on the tables and sang of their return to Thornhold . Meeting Madame Rosene, he offered to sell wines from the halfling of Bleeding Vines . He later shared drinks with Alvilda and Inkeri Margaster . Artemis Entreri later challenged Regis over his lack of secrecy at the Driftwood Tavern when they met later that year.</p>
<p>In the late 1490s DR , during Neverwinter's High Sun Games , the thieves Edgin Darvis , Holga Kilgore , Simon Aumar , and Doric rented an upstairs room at the Driftwood Tavern so they could create a portal from their hither-thither staff in a table and infiltrate the Castle Never vault. However, also at the tavern was Jil Torbo , a member of the Absolution Council who recognized Edgin and Holga from their escape from Revel's End . She fetched the Neverwinter Guard , but by the time they arrived, the thieves had gone their separate ways and Doric was through the portal .</p>
