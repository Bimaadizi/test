<p>The Clan Orcsmasher was a dwarvish clan that resided in the Cloud Peaks and dedicated themselves to ridding the mountains of orcs , goblins , and other evil marauding humanoids sometime before 1374 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The dwarves of Clan Orcsmasher were known for their disdain towards orcs, goblins, and various evil humanoids who plagued the Cloud Peaks. The clan resided in the Peaks and continued their endless fight against the evil tribes for several centuries. The clan's demise came when the orcish and goblin tribes of the Cloud Peaks entered an alliance to destroy their hated enemies. One morning, a horde of humanoids poured off the mountains, swallowing the Clan Orcsmasher's home. The ensued bloody and savage war lasted for several days. In the end, only Dorgan Orcsmasher was left alive, along with his wife and children. Seeing no other way, the dwarf who was to become a hero of his people stood unmoved, like an ancient oak tree, alone against the horde. He bought enough time for his family to escape certain doom but fell under the relentless onslaught.</p>
<p>One year later, Dorgan's family returned to the massacre's site only to discover a mountain of slain orcs and goblins with the body of the family's patriarch propped up against it. At his feet laid Dorgan's Defenderâ€Ž , his enchanted battleaxe that served its master till the bitter end. Thus, Dorgan Orcsmasher became celebrated by the dwarf-kin as the exemplar of dwarven endurance and determination, and Clan Orcsmasher - a dark moment in the stout folk's history.</p>
