<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , a sister of Neely's employee Mirolyn Skolotti, was murdered by supposed members of the Municipal Guard of Arrabar who claimed she was falsely advertising herself as a wizard via forehead markings. Several days after the young woman's death, Vambran Matrell paid a visit to Neely's store, seeking to speak about Mirolyn's sister in privacy. The cheesemaker allowed Nimra and Mirolyn Skolotti to use his private quarters above the store. The conversation aided Vambran's investigation of the commoner's unjust death.</p>
