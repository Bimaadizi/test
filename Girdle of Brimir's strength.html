<p>The girdle of Brimir's strength was a unique variant of girdle of giant strength that was made by Brimir , a renowned frost giant brewer in Jotunheim , as a gift to a group of adventurers from the city of Ravens Bluff .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This girdle was made from a strip of rawhide that Brimir had cut off his own giant-sized belt and had a crimson hue from being thoroughly stained with his blood. The girdle's clasp was carved from the tooth of a bulette . All along the girdle's length, Giantish runes were carved into it.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Enchanted with rune magic , the girdle of Brimir's strength gave its wearer tremendous strength, much like a standard girdle of giant strength . Where the belt differed in effect was causing the wearer to grow to a height of 12 ft (3.7 m). These effects only lasted for up to four hours per day. After the effect was deactivated the wearer temporarily felt weaker than before and needed to rest for around twice the amount of time that the effect was active for.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime around the 14 th century DR , a group of adventurers from Ravens Bluff journeyed to Jotunheim in search of the legendary Well of Mimir so they could learn how to destroy a powerful githyanki artifact known only as the Great Machine .</p>
<p>According to some sources they came to Brimir's hall as honored guests of his friend Habrok Icecaster , having proven their worth to him and his friends by hunting a bulette. The giants gathered in the hall felt indifferent towards the guests, so to break tensions Brimir wagered a contest of four tests for the adventurers - eating, drinking, running, and wrestling. He was even willing to wager three magic items if they would wager three comparably permanent or major charged items.</p>
<p>In eating they faced off against the fire giant Logi and had to reach the middle of a 10 feet (3 meters) trencher of stew. In drinking they faced no one, but had to drink alcohol from a massive horn as fast as they could. In running they faced the young giant Hugi and had to make it to the far end of the hall. Finally, in wrestling they faced Brimir's old mother Elli , as the giants felt any other competitor would make things unfair.</p>
<p>Some claimed the adventurers managed to beat all four tests and for showing such prowess Brimir chose to give them an additional gift, creating the girdle of Brimir's strength .</p>
