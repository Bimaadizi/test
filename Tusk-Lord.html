<p>Tusk-Lord was the chieftain of a somewhat peaceful tribe of gargoyles who resided in the Windrider Glade of Myth Drannor circa 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Tusk-Lord taught his tribe of gargoyles to respect strength, bloodshed, and suffering. He was the strongest of his kind and sought capable challengers to kill and get stronger.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Tusk-Lord was the more intelligent of his kind as well as bigger in size. His thick stony skin was almost impregnable, and his razor-sharp claws were dripping with paralyzing poison.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tusk-Lord came to lord over his fellow gargoyles of the Windrider Glade who respected strength sometime before 1369 DR. These cruel predators, however, did not seek to slay; they sought a challenge. In 1369 DR, a group of adventurers attracted the gargoyle leader's attention. The heroes, later known as the Veiled Ones , were bravely fighting through countless dangers in the ruins, slaying arraccats , cultists , orc warriors, and other foes. The gargoyles came to respect the adventurers, calling them the Great Ones.</p>
<p>Once the Veiled Ones reached Windrider Glade, they met Tusk-Lord's tribe members, who did not attack the adventurers, but instead attempted to communicate in the gargoyle language . Subsequently, the heroes dug up an ancient enchanted amulet called the Stone Mouth and were able to talk to the strange winged elementals . The gargoyled happily confirmed the adventurers' identity as the Great Ones and fled, letting Tusk-Lord himself confront the Veiled Ones. The gargoyle lord wanted to test his mettle against the toughest opponents who spilled copious amounts of blood on their way to the heart of the City of Song. Then the fierce gargoyle fell in battle, he left behind his treasure, one of the magical planet pieces of the Orrery in the Speculum Grounds , bringing the ancient device one step closer to being prepared and functional.</p>
