<p>Hoshi Katahiroi was a daimyo of a province in Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time before the midâ€“14 th century DR , Hoshi's province was devastated by severe tempests and lightning strikes that ignited fires. Hoshi's respected shukenja advisors quickly divined that this weather was not natural, but the work of a mighty dragon of a type never encountered before, dubbed "Celestial Fury". Some thought it arose from the primal chaos of a time before Kara-Tur's creation, others that it was a modern abomination.</p>
<p>Hoshi wished the dragon dead to spare his province more devastation. Thus he commissioned a reclusive weaponsmith and master of mystic arts named Chigatta to forge for him a weapon that could destroy the dragon's spirit as well as its body. Chigatta created a katana , more fine than anyone could've imagined, and gave it the name of the dragon it was meant to slay, Celestial Fury .</p>
<p>The sword was imbued with the power of flight and so Hoshi took to the skies to hunt the dragon through the storm clouds. For days, a dragon's roars and a man's shouts echoed across the skies, and lightning flashed through the nights. Finally, Hoshi was victorious, slaying the dragon's body and trapping its spirit inside his sword. The two Celestial Furies became one and the sword's order was imposed on the dragon's chaos.</p>
<p>To celebrate his triumph, and cement the dragon's defeat, Hoshi then asked Chigatta to craft a scabbard from the dragon's hide and to embed the dragon's magical pearl in the hilt.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while Hoshi was a great warrior, he was weak of will and the dragon's spirit possessed him. Under the dragon's control, Hoshi killed first Chigatta, and then himself. The blade disappeared shortly afterward, probably abandoned by Hoshi's grief-stricken family.</p>
