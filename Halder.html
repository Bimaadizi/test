In turn, the arch-necromancer worked to acquire enough power to destroy Halder and all the other mages who'd opposed him. In the late 1350s DR, Velsharoon was working on a means of achieving godhood, and Halder and the others feared for their safety and for the safety and stability of the Realms. Velsharoon ultimately achieving godhood in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR .</p>
