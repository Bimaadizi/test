<p>Naphtha or naphthalene was a volatile and dangerous liquid mineral oil refined from rock oil , mainly used in flammable weapons.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Naphtha was a thin, translucent yellow liquid.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Naphtha was refined from rock oil, usually obtained from naturally-occurring tar pits and springs beneath the ground. Ventdiver fish were noted for containing rock oil in their swim bladders, making them a handy source for making naphtha.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Naphtha was a useful flammable agent. Alchemists used mineral oils such as naphtha to make sticky, burning concoctions like alchemist's fire , everburning oil , and oil of fiery burning , which could be loaded into a flame thrower , or delivered alongside another flammable weapon. Naphtha could be used as part of traps that sprayed intruders with the substance, ideally followed up by them being set aflame. It could also be stored in cisterns beneath fortifications to be deployed against besieging forces.</p>
<p>Naphtha could also be used for non-fire-related purposes including being used as a solvent for cleaning and maintenance, such as stripping paint , grease, and oil from materials such as wood.</p>
<p>The image trap spell used a figurine of the caster soaked in naphtha.</p>
