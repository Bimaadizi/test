<p>Giant hornets were aggressive massive mutations of normal-sized hornets .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Giant hornets were flying carnivorous insects with long bodies, a fell stinger, and an average wingspan of 10 feet (3 meters) or more.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Giant hornets were solitary but extremely aggressive insects, rarely encountered in groups. They always attacked on sight.</p>
<p>Fire had a weakening effect on these giant insects, and smoke was a repellent.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Giant hornets swooped down on their prey, pinning and holding a victim with their legs while repeatedly stabbing them with their poisonous stinger. The poison in the stinger caused 2–6 hours of paralyzation.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the hornets' buzzing was loud enough to be heard 150 feet (46 meters) away in dungeon corridors and from half as far outside, preventing unexpected and stealthy attacks.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>They were carnivorous, just like their normal-sized relatives. Unlike bees, hornets did not lose their stingers and lives after an attack.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>The giant hornets' natural habitats were coniferous forests and, on occasion, underground caves.</p>
<p>In north Faerûn giant hornets could be found in Thar , the rimwood area of Cormanthor , the King's Forest of Cormyr , Mistledale , Shadowdale , and around the Pool of Yeven .</p>
<p>Beyond Faerun , giant hornets were known to inhabit various mountains and hills in Maztica . In east Zakhara , they could be found in the Grey Jungle . And in the Crowded Sea south of Zakhara , giant hornets could be found on the Djinni's Claws and Nada al-Hazan island chains.</p>
