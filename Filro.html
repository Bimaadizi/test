<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in or before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Filro was among the three drow who began to search out the legendary Adamantine Forge in the Underdark underneath the Western Heartlands , to the point of obsession. At one point in his search, Filro was forsaken by his companions, Xargrim and Dhourn Ba'Tol , and was left to die. A pack of hook horrors found the lost drow man and fed him gnomish flesh, nursing him back to health. By 1492 DR, Filro lost his sanity and lived as a hermit alongside his hook horror pack.</p>
