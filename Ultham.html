<p>Ultham, son of Urrekanam , also known as Ultham-Urre , was a powerful archmage and planewalker of Chessenta in the 10 th or early 11 th centuries DR . He created the Magical Chessmen of Ultham-Urre .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Known to be fairly pleasant (at least for a wizard ), Ultham had a great love of Oslin , a small trading village near the hills where he lived. He enjoyed playing chess with the village elders for hours on end.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Although the facts are lost to history, sages theorized that, sometime during the reign of King Tchazzar ( 929 â€“ 1018 DR ), Ultham predicted Chessenta's swift collapse and subsequent incessant warring. Thus, using minerals and gems found in the Hills of Maerth, he created the Magical Chessmen of Ultham-Urre to defend Oslin and his friends. He even stocked the inside of the pieces with supplies: water, non-perishable food, armor , weapons , equipment, and spell components . Before he journeyed into the planes , he left the Chessmen in Oslin, where for several years they were just used as simple chess pieces.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He kept a slender tower in the Hills of Maerth in southern Chessenta.</p>
<p>Presumably named for him, a magical item called a billet of Ultham (a lesser rod of quickened metamagic ) lay in the palace treasury of Cimbar and later the hoard of Tchazzar by 1374 DR .</p>
