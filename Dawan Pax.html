<p>Dawan Pax was a legendary druid active in the North during the 15 th century DR . He was known as the Hunter's Curse owing to his reputation for disrupting hunting events and for hunting hunters.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was graceful and athletic. Despite being quite large, he could move very quietly.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Dawan was a devoted and sometimes brutal defender of nature, and preferred the company of animals over people. He was vegetarian.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Dawan sought to protect animals from hunters, and failing that, to avenge them with great ferocity. He often used his wild shape powers to live among animals, and his preferred wild shape was that of a gray wolf in homage to an old friend. He was also known to use wild shape to adopt the form of animals slain by hunters when he pursued them for revenge. Alternatively, he would use magic to turn invisible when he hunted hunters.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He had an item called the Soul of the Earth which allowed him to easily track other hunters.</p>
<p>He was known to carry flasks of an invigorating tonic made from peaches , mint , and ginger .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dawan Pax was raised in an unremarkable orcish village where he learned to hunt alongside an old gray wolf, who lived in harmony with his village and came to be his closest friend. After the wolf was killed by outsiders for sport, Dawan vowed to hunt them down. This began his long career as a peerless hunter, a fearsome warrior, and a powerful druid.</p>
<p>He would come to travel across many lands, and never encountered a hunter who could defeat him. At some point, the Harpells of Longsaddle called on his aid when a group of particularly viscous hunters arrived in the Moonwood to hunt for pegasi . He made quick work of the hunters before bringing some of the injured pegasi to Longsaddle to establish a sanctuary. He was unaware that the Harpells collected such creatures.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, Dawan Pax was a legendary figure. Some hunters did not even believe he truly existed, instead thinking that he was a boogeyman invented to scare them. Others believed that he was raised by animals, which was why he strove to protect them from hunters, while still others believed he was nothing but a mindless brute undeserving of any respect.</p>
