<p>Angels of valor were the most numerous, yet weakest, of the Astral Sea angels that served deities .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Angels of valor were always quite courageous and fierce.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>These angels were capable of striking their enemies with lightning and when injuried they could temporarily engulf their bladed weaponry in fire.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>When in battle, these immortals wore chain mail . They fought with either a greatsword or a dagger and a longsword . Their combat tactics were straightforward, wading right into enemy forces, but did well with collaborating with others of their kind on attacks.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>These angels acted as the foot soldiers of deities, following the commands of more powerful angels, such as angels of battle , and some clerics .</p>
<p>Some deities would send one of these angels to reward devout worshipers that had done something to please them. This reward could be a magic item or even the service of the angel itself for a period of ten days.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1479 DR , a group of adventurers fleeing from Caer Westphal were ambushed by a group of angels wielding swords of black flame and wearing black tabards , emblazoned with the unholy symbol of Cyric . They declared themselves envoys of his church and commanded the adventurers to give up one member of their party in return for their lives, saying that Cyric wished it so, or that they would otherwise face death at their hands.</p>
