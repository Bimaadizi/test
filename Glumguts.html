<p>The Glumguts were an extended family of dark ones —predominantly dark creepers —that operated in the Shadowfell city of Evernight as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Glumguts were paid by the Empire of Netheril to maintain their Evernight consulate at the so-called dark creeper enclave . In practice, this simply meant receiving messages for the Netherese and ensuring that the consulate was a safe place for visiting shadovar . The Glumguts were not granted any formal authority under this relationship, and the Netherese would destroy them if they did anything that embarrassed or weakened Netheril's interests in Evernight. This meant that the Glumguts did no dare to harm the undead citizenry of Evernight and were likewise dissuaded from picking fights with the Thayan delegation in the city: despite the Thayans being enemies of Netheril, Evernight had declared itself to be neutral territory in their ongoing conflict . However, they did spy on the Thayans and might ambush to rob or assassinate a straggler.</p>
<p>To supplement their income, the Glumguts engaged in banditry outside Evernight's walls and along the Shadowfell Road , and would steal from any living visitors to the city.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>As of 1479 DR , the Glumguts were led by a dark stalker known as Blackclaw , who was feared among their ranks for his cruelty.</p>
<p>Other notable members included Blackclaw's son, Blackcut , and his cousins, Thrax and Vynnia . These three were known to engage in pranks across Evernight, and were the only ones brave enough to test Blackclaw's patience, largely because they believed that Blackcut's relationship with his father would protect them. As of 1479 DR, the three had engaged in acts that had worsened Netheril's reputation in the city, but Blackclaw had not yet found out.</p>
