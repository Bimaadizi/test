<p>The Norheim Isles , also known as the Fractured Lands , were a chain of small islands within the larger Moonshae Isles which hosted several small Northlander kingdoms collectively known as Norheim .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Norheim Isles included the islands of Giantspine , Canthrell , Llorgh , and Graygruun , alongside another half-dozen lesser islands.</p>
<p>The Isles were barren, rocky, and battered by frequent storms. They could support only a little agriculture and were virtually devoid of trees, with only the mountainous Giantspine being capable of supporting major farming or even small forests. The rocky shores of the islands concealed several sheltered coves (where most settlements were found) and were riddled with sea caves, some of which connected to long, underground passages and saltwater rivers leading to the Underdark beneath the ocean.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Norheim Isles were located in the northwestern region of the Moonshae Isles, due west of the Korinn Archipelago . The Isles formed the northern boundary of the Sea of Moonshae , with the islands of Norland to the southwest and Alaron to the southeast.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the Ffolk first established themselves in the Moonshaes in the 2 nd century DR, a few made their way to the Norheim Isles and established small kingdoms there, such as at Hammerstaad . These kingdoms became isolated as the Ffolk squabbled amongst each other. In the Year of the Thousand Snows, 256 DR , the Norheim Isles were the first place that Northlander raiders first landed, who easily forced the Ffolk to pay them tribute. By the Year of the Silver Flagon, 825 DR , the Northlanders desired the land itself, and conquered the Isles with ease. The Ffolk did not acknowledge Northlander control of the Isles until the Year of the Animated Armor, 944 DR .</p>
