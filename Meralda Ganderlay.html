<p>Meralda Auck , formerly Meralda Ganderlay , was a human woman from the fiefdom of Auckney near the Spine of the World in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR , aged only 17, Meralda caught the eye of Lord Feringal Auck , who immediately fell in love with her and invited her to Castle Auck for dinner. Meralda was conflicted by his affections, having already committed herself to Jaka Sculi . Following her return home, she told her father Dohni of her rebuff of the lord's affections. Dohni proceeded to beat her, calling her selfish for choosing Jaka over Feringal, whom they needed to acquire a cleric 's service to heal her wilting mother.</p>
<p>Following her second visit to Castle Auck, Meralda asked her driver, Liam Woodgate , to let her off prematurely, after which she ran into Jaka. They shared a kiss, only to be interrupted by Dohni, who beat Jaka into submission while sending Meralda away.</p>
<p>Desiring one night where she was free to choose, Meralda snuck out to meet with Jaka, before losing her virginity to him. Afterwards, Jaka begged Meralda to run away with him, but she refused out of duty to her family. Three weeks later, Meralda found she was pregnant with Jaka's child. Terrified of what her father or Feringal would do if they found out, she visited Jaka to inform him of her pregnancy. When she proposed they run away together, to her disappointment, Jaka now refused out of fear of living in poverty and of her figure becoming fat and ugly from motherhood, causing her to realize he never truly loved her.</p>
<p>Desperate to cover up her pregnancy, Meralda attempted to seduce Feringal in order to pass off Jaka's child as his own, only to be interrupted by his sister Priscilla Auck . Nevertheless, she managed to convince him to have their wedding on the autumn equinox . But as she was returning home, her carriage was accosted by Jaka, who made a desperate plea for her to take him back, but he made the mistake of saying he didn't want Feringal to raise their child as his own. Disappointed that Jaka thought of himself in competition with Feringal and that he would never give her and her child a good life, Meralda formally rejected him.</p>
<p>On her next trip to Castle Auck in hopes of seducing Feringal again, her carriage was waylaid by a pair of highwaymen: Wulfgar and Morik the Rogue . Though the duo stole what gold she had, Wulfgar refused to let Morik have his way with her. Instead, they took her a mile away so she wouldn't alert the castle guard before releasing her so she could return to the unconscious driver, Liam.</p>
<p>Prior to the wedding, Meralda learned that Feringal had kept true to his word and summoned clerics from the temple of Helm in Luskan , Watcher Beribold and High Watcher Kalorc Risten to heal her mother. Later, during the wedding by the cliffs, Jaka unexpectedly showed up again, demanding Meralda run away with him or he would cast himself to his death. Initially, Meralda believed it to be a bluff, until Jaka accidentally slipped and fell to his death when Feringal sent his guards after him. As a result, the wedding was postponed for three days.</p>
<p>A week into her marriage, fearing that Priscilla and Steward Temigast suspected her infidelity, Meralda falsely told them and Feringal that Wulfgar had raped her. However, instead of letting the matter go as she had hoped, a vengeful Feringal hired a wizard to capture the barbarian . When Wulfgar was brought in, Meralda tried to deny his identity but her efforts were for naught thanks to Liam's testimony. With Wulfgar doomed to a torturous execution, a guilt-ridden Meralda secretly aided in his escape from the dungeon .</p>
<p>When Meralda later gave birth to a baby girl seven months into her marriage, it only confirmed Priscilla's suspicions that Wulfgar wasn't the father and tried to convince her brother to have Meralda tried for treason and her child executed. Fortuitously, the castle was infiltrated by Wulfgar and Morik, with the former falsely laying claim to the child to protect Meralda's reputation. Accepting that her child would never be safe in Auckney, Meralda reluctantly agreed to Wulfgar's proposal.</p>
<p>In the aftermath, upon hearing a condescending Priscilla suggesting she was going to cuckold her husband again, Meralda sternly warned her sister-in-law not to judge her, reminding her that she had Feringal's ear now and that she could easily convince him to strip her of her noble status and send her to live with the peasants she despised.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR , Castle Auck played host to the Companions of the Hall , who had rescued three of their soldiers and captured a half-ogre involved in the attack. Priscilla assumed the adventurers desired a reward, but Drizzt Do'Urden explained that they were returning the soldiers to their homes and delivering the prisoner, hoping he would have information that would lead them to the notorious pirate Sheila Kree . Meralda readily offered the Companions lodging within the castle, earning the support of her husband and the disapproval of her sister-in-law; she even threatened to place their guests in Priscilla's room if she continued to protest. To her disappointment, Drizzt stated that they only could stay the night before resuming their hunt for Kree. The Lord and Lady of Auckney then held a feast for the adventurers as King Bruenor and Regis regaled them with tales of faraway lands, as Meralda had desired.</p>
<p>Much later, Meralda noticed that Drizzt and Catti-brie had left the festivities and quickly managed to find them to encourage them to rejoin the party to listen to the tale of the slaying of Shimmergloom . As the couple took her up on her suggestion, she guessed that they were hoping to locate Wulfgar, which the drow quietly confirmed. She then tried to learn of the status of her child, only to find that they were already aware of the whole affair. They informed Meralda that her child was named Colson .</p>
<p>The next morning, as they were seeing the Companions off, Meralda regarded Drizzt and Catti-Brie with a silent smile in turn, which was not lost on Feringal, whose emotional wounds were still raw from hearing Bruenor's tale of Wulfgar, leading him to take out his anger on the half-ogre prisoner.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She was the daughter of Dohni and Biaste Ganderlay , who were farmers on the side of Maerlon Mountain . She had a younger sister, Tori , who was born six years after herself.</p>
<p>The young lord Feringal Auck fell in love with her. She eventually married him, but not before she conceiving a child ( Colson ) by Jaka Sculi . The child was adopted by Wulfgar , despite (or perhaps due to) her having falsely accused him of rape. Wulfgar returned Colson to her mother in Auckney after the death of his wife, Delly Curtie .</p>
