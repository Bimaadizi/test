<p>Sarith Kzekarit was a drow warrior who was infected by demonic madness during the late 1480s DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Sarith had a fatalistic approach to problems. He feared he was going mad, but the truth was more sinister: he was under the influence of the demon lord Zuggtmoy .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sarith was a drow of Menzoberranzan living in the Velkynvelve outpost.</p>
<p>During the late 1480s DR, he captured the myconid Stool , but had been infected with myconid spores corrupted by Zuggtmoy. Under a spore-induced-madness, Sarith killed a fellow drow warrior and was put among the slaves, waiting for the right time to be transported back to the city and to be sacrificed to Lolth .</p>
