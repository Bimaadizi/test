<p>The Pedestal of Jondar the Valiant was the lower part of what once was thought to be a statue of Jondar the Valiant , a paladin of Helm , who slew a medusa in the Starspire Mountains in the Year of the Falling Moon, 1217 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Pedestal of Jondar the Valiant was an old carved slab of stone that once held a statue on top of it. The block was plastered with moss and its sides were decorated with carvings of medusa heads.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After Jondar's heroic deed, slaying a medusa, her likeness was said to have been carved out of stone by the stonecutters' guild of Ithmong in or soon after 1217 DR . The statue was placed at the center of town atop a great fountain. With generations passing, details of the statue's creation became obfuscated, and her deeds in dealing with medusae forgotten. The statue of Jondar the Valiant remained atop the fountain, growing moss and collecting pigeon dung .</p>
<p>The Pedestal of Jondar the Valiant was all that was left from a statue after a mage named Mibbet the Meddler , in the Year of the Boot, 1343 DR , decided to cast the stone to flesh spell . It was just a whim, but the spell took hold, and the statue, now Jondar in flesh and blood, stepped down from the pedestal, thanked Mibbet, and walked off into the sunset.</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , The Pedestal of Jondar the Valiant was displayed in the magic curio shop that belonged to Mintassan the Magnificent, a planeswalker from Westgate . Jondar's story, the statue's creation, and the paladin released from her stony prison were written on a plaque near the Pedestal.</p>
