<p>In 228Â DR , the thief Farl of Hastarl fooled local thug Shildo into leaving a new arrival to the city, Eladar (an assumed identity of prince Elminster Aumar ) alone by claiming that Eladar was obviously enspelled by Neldryn Hawklyn already. When Shildo said no one would know, Farl said Antaerl had just left to explain the situation, leaving it to Farl to dissuade Shildo because of some debt Antaerl owed him. This persuaded Shildo.</p>
