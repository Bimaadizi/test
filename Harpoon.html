<p>Harpoons were spear -like weapons used to hunt marine animals.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The metal head of a harpoon was fixed to a wooden shaft. The head was often pointed and hooked to increase the weapon's grip in flesh and cause more harm. The harpoon was connected to a rope which the thrower could release or increase tension on to reel a target in or throw it off balance. A typical harpoon weighed 6 pounds (2.7 kilograms) and could be purchased for 20 gp .</p>
