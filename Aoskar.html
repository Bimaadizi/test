<p>Aoskar , also known as the Power of Portals and the Keeper of Gateways , was the self-appointed god of portals .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>His holy symbol resembled, and often took the form of, a large key.</p>
<h2>Divine Realm</h2>
<p>After being slain and cast out by the Lady of Pain , Aoskar remained adrift in the Astral Plane .</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Aoskar was venerated as a god within his own temple in the City of Doors. At the peak of his influence, Aoskar boasted half the planewalkers in Sigil among his worshipers. Some even maintained the belief that the Lady of Pain herself, was merely an aspect of Aoskar.</p>
<p>Following Aoskar's death, a group known as the 'Will of the One'―a sect of the Sign of One faction in Sigil―took efforts to resurrect the dead god.</p>
<h3>Notable Worshipers</h3>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After declaring his own divine influence over portals , Aoskar attempted to wrest control of Sigil from the Lady of Pain. While the exact specifics of this effort was not entirely clear, Aoskar developed a notable following in the city, enough to draw the Lady's ire.</p>
<p>Tired of his efforts to undermine her, the Lady slew the denizen of the City of Doors, and cast out his corpse into the Astral Plane. His temple was destroyed, his name stricken from all records in Sigil, and veneration of Aoskar was strictly forbidden in the Lady's city, under pain of death by the Mercykillers .</p>
<p>Aoskar's divine remains drifted alongside those of notable Faerûnian deities that remained dead for some time. Notable among these were: Amaunator , Bane , Bhaal , Ibrandul , Leira , Moander , and Myrkul .</p>
<p>The Athar faction—who claimed that true deities did not really exist, and whose existence was unfathomable by mortals―pointed to the dead gods of the Astral Plane, including Aoskar, as evidence of their beliefs.</p>
<p>The Four Doors portals ceased to work entirely as intended following Aoskar's death.</p>
