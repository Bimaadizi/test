<p>Ghost touch was both an armor quality and a weapon quality that could be added to any weapon or armor to make it effective against incorporeal creatures .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Any armor, shield , or weapon that possessed this quality was both corporeal and incorporeal simultaneously. This gave it a misty and translucent appearance. This made armor more protective against incorporeal creatures, such as ghosts , and made weapons capable of harming them normally as though they were enchanted . However, this effect would not pass on to the ammunition fired by ranged weapons, such as arrows and bullets .</p>
<p>As items with this quality were considered incorporeal, such creatures were likewise capable of wielding them. Items with this quality were also able to pass through solid objects if the wielder desired.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>The creator had to use either the ghost touch armor or ghost touch weapon spell when crafting the appropriate item to add this property.</p>
<p>Besides armor and weapons, this quality could be applied to rings , rods , staffs , wands , and wondrous items.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>Some experienced Thayan gladiators had their horns, claws, and other natural weapons enhanced as ghost touch weapons.</p>
