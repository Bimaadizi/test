<p>Ustilagors ( pronounced : / uː ˈ s t ɪ l ɑː g ɔːr z / oo-STIL-a-gorz ) were the larval stage of the development of intellect devourers .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ustilagors were said to be the size and shape of a human brain, covered in a grey fungal growth, with four short, spindly legs and no feet. A pair of 3‑foot-long (0.91‑meter), ribbon-like tendrils sprouted from the front end.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Ustilagors were essentially mindless.</p>
<p>One of the most notable traits of Ustilagors was their inexplicable craving for gems. Some scholars speculated that Ustilagors used gems for energy containment, though no one knew for sure. This peculiarity Ustilagors them to attack specifically those who carried gems, making individuals with gems their primary targets.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Despite their mindlessness, ustilagors possessed deadly psionic abilities. They were reported to either be able to psionically induce a strong aversion to fungus in a creature within 30 ft (9.1 m), and to be able to telempathically project a different emotion into a creature's mind. Other reports more simply said that ustilagors could use aversion , detect psionics , energy adaptation , id insinuation , and telempathic projection at will, and body adjustment thrice each day.</p>
<p>The tendrils of ustilagors were coated in a corrosive and toxic alkaline fluid. The fungal growth on the body was actually a symbiotic organism that kept it from drying out, safe from cerebral parasites, and safe from certain attacks by fungal creatures (such as spores, poisons, etc.).</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Despite being considerably weaker than their adult forms, ustilagors were patient hunters that could follow their prey for several hours before attacking. They hunted in small packs and attacked their victims by robbing them of their thoughts, slowly hazing and confusing their minds.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Ustilagors were found underground either alone or in small pods of up to three individuals (though Ustilagors were so spiteful that, like their adult kin, could attack one another at any moment). Illithids raised ustilagors for food, and sometimes allowed an ustilagor to reach adulthood, using intellect devourers as guards.</p>
<p>They were considered a delicacy by the mind flayers of Oryndoll . The Thrall Market sold ustilagors to visitors for high prices in several varieties such as raw, pickled, or seasoned with fungi.</p>
