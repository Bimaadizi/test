<p>Orthinos Eln was a shadovar priest of Shar active in the late 15 th century DR .</p>

<p>Orthinos was a shade . His preferred means of attack was to fire a beam of necromantic energy at his foes.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Orthinos ran the Cathedral of Night in the ruined enclave of Xinlenal , and spent a fair amount of his time in prayer.</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , he was tasked by Prince Clariburnus Tanthul to oversee the excavation of the enclave, and he managed the logistics of supplies arriving at the worksite from the Shadowfell via a portal in his shrine.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Orthinos served Clariburnus Tanthul—one of the twelve Princes of Shade —and regularly communed with him.</p>
