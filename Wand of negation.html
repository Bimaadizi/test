<p>A wand of negation was a magic item that cancelled the effects of spells and other magic items.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These wands negated the powers of certain spells and magic items. A pale beam of light would shoot from the wand when pointed at the desired target. There was a 75% chance that the targeted item would fail when used. Each use of a wand of negation expended a single charge. These wands could not be recharged.</p>
