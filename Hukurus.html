<p>Hukurus was a young deepspawn in Undermountain in 1375 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Hukurus resided in a lair in the second level of the dungeon, surrounded by its spawned minions. It never left its lair willingly. It had two spawned grimlocks with it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hukurus lived in a deepspawn community in the second level but in 1375 DR the earthquake caused by Halaster Blackcloak 's death destroyed a drow base, and the fleeing drow put pressure on the deepspawn. Hukurus's mother abandoned it to save its own life. Hukurus relocated to the southwestern part of the level, where it made its lair.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Hukurus knew itself to be a weak monster, so it was cautious. It could spawn only drow , dwarves , and grimlocks but hoped to eat and spawn other creatures in time.</p>
