<p>Valarde's harp was a magical instrument capable of stirring the air around itself when played. Though of Myth Drannan origin, it survived the city's fall , and more than six centuries later had become a part of the Harpers ' arsenal by 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Valarde's harp , like most instruments of Myth Drannor, was not large, typically between 2 feet (0.61 meters) and 3 feet (0.91 meters) tall. Though it had many strings—twenty, at least, and thirty-six, at most—the harp 's modest size meant they were set very close together, which made it even more difficult to play correctly. The highly resonant nature of the brass , copper , and electrum strings meant that half of a skilled harper's effort was dedicated simply to muffling certain chords when they strummed others.</p>
<p>In its original construction, Valarde's harp was nearly triangular. The wood pieces that comprised the instrument were polished to the point of shining, regardless of the material's dark coloration—a deep red and black that, itself, was elegantly tessellated by ivory and gilt . Three such pieces made up the archetypal Myth Drannan harp: a fore-pillar, a neck, and a body. The first, which curled outward, was the segment furthest from the player, forming the harp's front edge; the second formed the top of the harp, bearing the pins around which the instrument's strings were tuned; and the third was held to the harper's shoulder, supporting the soundboard that, itself, held to the bottom of the strings.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The magic within a Valarde's harp , as with any of its Myth Drannan peers, emanated an aura of good , which distinguished it from an ordinary instrument. What further set Valarde's harp apart was its control over currents of air, an effect shaped into two possible forms at the whims of the harp's player: a wall or a gust . Either one emerged powerfully from the instrument's body after a minute of consistent strumming, but the former persisted an added three minutes if not willed to end early.</p>
<p>There was also a secondary property to the magic in a Valarde's harp , one minor in comparison to the stirring of winds. Whenever the instrument was played, the magic inside coalesced into small beads of glowing light, which were capable of weaving and winking around the wielder's head, as well as the harp's own strings.</p>
<p>It was unfortunate, however, that it was possible for Valarde's harp to lose its enchantment. Though its metallic strings could be replaced at leisure, for they were not the source of its powers, it would be impossible to regain the original magic if ever the harp's fine, wooden form was broken. Even mending the pieces had no restorative effects on the harp's unique abilities.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The utopic Myth Drannor was once home to many master craftsmen of human , elven , or mixed lineage, and each enchanted countless items, of which Valarde's harp was a prime example. Even so, the fall of the city was calamitous; despite the prevalence of such beautiful instruments, few were the Myth Drannan harps that survived, and fewer yet retained the Art that had once been imbued into them.</p>
<p>By the mid–14 th century DR , hundreds of years later, only nine types were known to Elminster , the renowned sage . Among them was Valarde's harp and, according to the Old Mage's estimates, there may have been at least twenty such harps, with their dweomers unspoiled, still on Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>The beauty and unique abilities of Valarde's harp were only two of the many reasons that the instrument was sought after. As with its fellows, what truly elevated its renown was that the abilities of this Myth Drannan harp were able to be activated by anybody, requiring no specific training or attunement—they were not tied to a single kind of humanoid or alignment , nor to the musical talents of a bard . This simple fact, then, meant diverse groups and people prized Valarde's harp highly, including even figures as storied as Elminster.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this did not mean that Valarde's harps without their enchantment were considered worthless. By the value of their craftsmanship alone, many earned a place in the personal collections of various monarchs and mages .</p>
