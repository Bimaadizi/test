<p>This island rested southeast of Iligh√¥n , south of Wavecrest , and northwest of Reth . It was also where the Vilhon Reach met the Sea of Fallen Stars .</p>
<p>As of 1370 DR , the island was populated by a matriarchal tribe, comprised almost entirely of women, and ruled by Queen Elissa Tarixon . The island nation refused all visitors, even diplomatic envoys, and would trade only with select ships captained by women. The few men who existed on the island were considered highly-valuable slaves.</p>
<p>Ixinos was also the home base of the all-women mercenary company known as the She-Wolves , who secured Ixinos from pirate incursions as well as sought out mercenary opportunities throughout the Vilhon Reach.</p>
