<h2>History</h2>
<p>Horus was originally a young deity that often sided with Anhur in pressing change to his father, Re.</p>
<p>During the Mulhorandi uprising against the Imaskari, it was Horus that slew Lord Artificer Yuvaraj in −2488 DR . When Re was defeated by Gruumsh during the Orcgate Wars , the failing deity passed his powers and domain to Horus before passing on. Upon gaining this power Horus became Horus-Re, and began exhibiting the personality traits and beliefs of his dead father.</p>
<p>During the Second Sundering , Horus returned as a separate entity from Re along with other deities from the pantheon in the form of demigods and led the Mulhorandi uprising against the Imaskari , in a manner similar to how the Chosen manifested in other regions. As of 1489 DR , Mulhorand was led by the returned pantheon, who temporarily set their differences aside for the good of the Mulhorandi people.</p>
