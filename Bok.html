<p>Bok was a powerful flesh golem manufactured by Dendybar the Mottled , a wizard and the guardian of the northern spire in the Hosttower of the Arcane in the seaport city of Luskan .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR , Dendybar sent Bok alongside the wizard Sydney and the soldier Jierdan in search of Drizzt Do'Urden , believing that the drow possessed Crenshinibon or information on the powerful artifact.</p>
<p>Bok was destroyed by Drizzt during a vicious fight near Mithral Hall . Afterward, Dendybar teleported near the golem with the aim of recovering and reconstructing it. However, the spirit of Morkai the Red , a dead foe of Dendybar who was killed and enslaved as a spirit by the wizard, regained control of the remains of the golem and killed Dendybar.</p>
