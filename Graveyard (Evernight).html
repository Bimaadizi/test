<p>The Graveyard was a sprawling burial ground in the Shadowfell city of Evernight .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The vast Graveyard was littered with graves—ranging from simple earthen mounds to tombstones to mausoleums to deep pits filled with coffins —and forbidding marble and granite statues of watchful angels , devils , and gargoyles . The cries and howls of dangerous creatures echoed through the area.</p>
<p>While the Graveyard was sometimes used to bury one of Evernight's undead inhabitants if they were destroyed or slain, its main function was to host " funerals " in which living victims were ritualistically buried alive to later be eaten.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It was located in the south of the city. It occupied the same place as did the Neverdeath Graveyard in Neverwinter on the Material Plane .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of 1479 DR , Valindra Shadowmantle and her Thayan forces were making use of the shadow crossing in Neverdeath to infiltrate Neverwinter, and the Netherese forces who opposed her sought to disrupt this operation. Around the same time, a number of Netherese shadar-kai could be found patrolling the Graveyard.</p>
