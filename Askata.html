<p>Askata was a strong easily crumbled yellow cheese from Impiltur .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Askata was crumbly and had a strong taste. It was created by blending goat and cow milk with addition of a certain type of moss that was later removed from the liquid before fermentation started. The resulting cheese melted smoothly and had a noticeable cheddar taste with an added flavor of roasted almonds that became stronger with age.</p>
<p>It was commonly served at the Swords Meet in Voonlar accompanying venison meat and mushrooms cooked in red wine . Human nobles considered askata cooked in wine to be "wonderful", while some of the hin tasters thought the dish to be "vomitous."</p>
