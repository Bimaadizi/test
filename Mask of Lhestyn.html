<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was created by Shilarn Silmaeril as a gift to her daughter Lhestyn . Lhestyn used the mask to infiltrate the Shadow Thieves with the goal of investigating the guild's activities. After successfully exposing the guild, the mask then became a symbol in Waterdeep. Waterdhavians look upon the mask as a symbol of justice. When Zelphar Arunsun , Lhestyn's husband, died in 1311Â DR , the mask vanished. Many suspected he was murdered by the Shadow Thieves; however, the guild continued to search for the missing mask.</p>
