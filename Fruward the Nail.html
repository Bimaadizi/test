<p>Fruward the Nail was an infamous and mysterious member of the Guild from the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Fruward was a visually unremarkable man whose reputation preceded him. One knew who Fruward was upon laying their eyes on the man. His forehead had a single nail with a wide square poised head driven into it. Fruward hid the nail's gleam under a handkerchief he wore under a ragged hat.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Despite their close relationship, Fruward and the Guildmaster rarely met in person, communicating via letters and sendings .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The man's nickname and the nail in his head were gifts of a disagreement with the Builders' Guild of Baldur's Gate over work contracts back when Fruward worked at one of the city's dry docks. Fruward was ambushed, pinned down, splashed with ale , and laid facedown after having a spike nailed into his forehead. The plan to make the death look like an accident was a failure thanks to then young Nine-Fingers Keene coming across Fruward. She hid at the same dry dock from the Flaming Fists and found Fruward still alive and struggling to breathe. Nine-Fingers cradled the man's head in her hands when he miraculously regained conciseness, and the men who attempted the murder returned, leading the Flaming Fist to the site of the "accident." Fruward was enraged and incoherent, strong enough to fight off his would-be murderers, and killed Flaming Fists in the process. Eventually, he managed to escape with Keene's help.</p>
<p>Now a Fist-killer, Fruward had little else to do but to survive through crime. The man fell into depression and desperation, wishing the assassination attempt left him dead, but Nine-Fingers Keene helped him once again, finding him a home and supplying him with everything he needed to survive, eventually recruiting him as a secret member of the Guild. This help earned Keene Fruward's zealous loyalty, following her orders and acting as a middleman when the Guild's involvement needed to remain a secret.</p>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the Guild entered a state of a guild war against an upstart Kingpin Stone Lord , secretly backed by the Cult of the Absolute . The Stone Lord's men attacked and disposed of many of the Guild's agents across the city, including the Bell-Breakers , whose fate remained unknown. Nine-Fingers Keene tasked Fruward the Nail with the investigation of Bell-Breakers, leading him to a belfry atop a temple in Heapside . He concluded that the Bell-Breakers were gone, demolished with the top of the tower they were in by the Stone Lord.</p>
