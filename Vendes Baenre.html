<p>Vendes Baenre , nicknamed Duk-Tak ("Unholy Executioner") was a drow priestess of Lolth of House Baenre in Menzoberranzan in the mid–14 th century DR . She was the fourth of Matron Mother Yvonnel Baenre 's daughters and also the master tormentress of the Baenre compound; her nickname was because of this "job".</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Vendes Baenre tortured Drizzt when he returned to Menzoberranzan and was captured by House Baenre. She was later killed by Drizzt when Cattie-brie and Artemis Entreri rescued him from the Baenre compound. in 1357 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Small of stature, Vendes was vicious and uncontrollably volatile, so much so that Yvonnel refused to grant her a room in the highest tier of the Baenre stalagmite. Since even an illithid was permitted to dwell there, this slight only shortened Vendes's temper.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>However, Yvonnel had some use for her daughter, sending Vendes to mete out punishment to lower-ranking drow.</p>
<p>Vendes wielded a unique seven-headed whip of fangs that could turn the skin of its victims into ebony . Yvonnel stored the resulting statues in a room for later sale.</p>
<p>Yvonnel let her daughter also punish priestesses in Arach-Tinilith . If a would-be priestess was believed to be straying from the Way of Lolth , Vendes was put to work on them. Their ebony statues were displayed in front of Arach-Tinilith for one year as a warning to all.</p>
<p>Vendes's "statues" of drow were prized by the elite of Gracklstugh , although after her death several statues mysteriously came to life and attacked their owners.</p>
