<p>Alavar was a harpist of some renown, active sometime before 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point before the late 14 th century DR , Alavar was known for owning the Instrument of the Winds , a unique enchanted musical instrument of sinister power. The magic harp captured souls of its past players, making the sounds produced by it especially haunting. At some point, the Instrument of the Winds captured the souls of both Alavar's parents, and he spent the rest of his life using the instrument and searching for a way to free the souls trapped within. It was unknown of Alavar's fate, but the Instrument of the Winds was still in existence, playing its haunting melodies as of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR .</p>
