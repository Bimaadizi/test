<p>The storoper , a portmanteau of stone and roper, also called tar roper , was a creature very similar to the roper , in that they would rope in their prey with 50‑foot-long (15‑meter) tentacles.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Standing 5 feet (1.5 meters) high and 2 ft (0.61 m) wide, they looked like small statues of ordinary ropers. Weighing some 500 pounds (230,000 grams), with gaping maws and six tentacles, they could sense movement up to some 200 feet (61 meters) away. The stony exterior of the storopers made them immune to ordinary missile fire from arrows and bolts .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Once the storoper sensed prey, it would become completely still, awaiting its target's approach. When only 50 feet (15 meters) away from its prey, three of the six tentacles would fling out to hit the prey. From the tentacles a venom would inject into the target, which would first immobilize, then confuse and dominate the affected individual. For the next minute or so, the affected prey would fight for the storoper against anyone else near it. Ideally the storoper would use all six tentacles to hit two individuals at once, so as to maximize its chances of overwhelming the nearby prey group. After the storoper had launched its vicious venom attack, it would attempt to drag prey into its maw much as normal ropers did.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>The storopers could, once dead, be pried open by hammer and chisel to access whatever non-organic valuables they had consumed recently.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Storopers were known to hunt in the deeper parts of Southkrypt , deep underground around 1358 DR .</p>
<p>Likewise in the deepest parts of fallen Tethyamar , where the mines and Underdark connected, storopers were to be found, feeding on the other creatures there hunting for ores and gems .</p>
