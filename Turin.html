<p>Turin was a humble desert rider inhabiting the High Desert of west Zakhara in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Turin was an unattractive man by most standards. His features included a huge nose, droopy eyes and huge ears. A disease he suffered from as a child left his body completely devoid of hair.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Turin had low self-esteem.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He wore a simple copper ring inscribed with his mother's name.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Turin survived an attack at sea by a zaratan as a young child, floating on a piece of drift wood from Suq Bay until he reached shore along the southern region of the High Desert. He wandered for a week through the desert until a tribe of nomads found him.</p>
<p>He spent the next decade of his life with the tribe where he learned the skills of the desert riders. He discovered a knack with dealing with animals and was even able to soothe them with a touch.</p>
<p>His tribe was ambushed by the House of Dhi'b and Turin would have perished had Khafaz ibn Dahz not arrived with a compliment of Tajari soldiers to drive off the raiders. Khafaz planned on selling Turin as a slave but quickly discovered his useful abilities with animals and the ways of the desert. Turin worked with Khafaz since being rescued in the desert.</p>
