<p>Tabacco , also known as tobacco , was a type of pipeweed – a dark plant with a sweet scent indigenous to Nexal and the jungle of Malatra .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tabacco leaves could be smoked in pipes, similarly to pipeweed of Faerûn , but it was also possible to roll them in cigars . In all applications, tabacco was said to be far superior in flavor to pipeweed.</p>
<p>The name of "tabacco" was derived from tabac , a form of Faerûnian pipeweed, because many smokers simply mistook tabacco to be a Maztican varietal of tabac.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Sealed pots of tabacco leaves imported from Nexal were available for purchase through Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue in the 1360s DR.</p>
<p>Imported balaumo was sold in cafes of Arrabar in the Vilhon Reach in the early 1370s DR. Namely, Efusio's Cafe offered a wide variety of fruit-infused tobacco blends, including cherry , apricot , apple , and even grapewood.</p>
<p>Some flavors of tobacco enjoyed by wizards in Magician's Row in Ravens Bluff in the late 1350s DR were Bittersage, Dragonfire, Golden Sea, Old Troll, and Saltweed.</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , a pouch of Maztican tabacco could sell for 30 gp on the Sword Coast .</p>
<h2>Usages</h2>
<p>The spell witchweed required the burning of tabacco as a material component .</p>
<h2>Notable Users</h2>
<p>Circa 1367 DR , in Ghars , Cormyr , tobacco was smoked by Mayor Tobald and in a pipe by Benelaius . A tobacconist in town sold both tobacco and pipeweed.</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, the dockmaster of Neverwinter was a tabacco enthusiast named Deorde .</p>
