<p>Seawraiths were aquatic incorporeal creatures somewhat similar in appearance of regular undead wraiths , guarding sunken treasures and serving Umberlee , the Bitch Queen.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Seawraiths appeared as emaciated translucent naked humanoids with parchment-thin skin and long hair that swirled in the waters of their habitats. Their eyes emanated sinister yellow radiance and mouth were filled with terrifying sharp teeth. They were practically invisible under water.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>They could not speak, but attacked victims who managed to escape a sea wraith's clutches told of hearing intense moaning that overwhelmed their senses.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>A sea wraith could move twice as fast underwater as it could flying through the air. They preferred to attack their victims with stealth, swooping in from unexpected angles beneath the water and grasping with their chilling touch. Sea wraiths enjoyed surrounding a target, effectively blinding them while sapping their strength with intense cold at the same time. The only way to escape such an attack was to move toward sunlight as a sea wraith was completely powerless within natural day light. A victim killed by a sea wraith would become one if its brethren within minutes unless their corpse was removed from the water.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>A sea wraith was an aquatic undead that haunted cold waters.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Seawraiths guarded Umberlee's Cache in Waterdeep 's Deepwater Harbor . Sometime in the days that followed the Spellplague , seawraiths menaced the city of Waterdeep . They emerged from the Sea of Swords to attack ships in the harbors of the City of Splendors and usually driven back into the sea by the agents of the Lords of Waterdeep .</p>
