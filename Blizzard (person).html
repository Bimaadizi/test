<h2>History</h2>
<p>Blizzard, then called Monique, was born in Hillsfar, to the city's cruel leader, sometime before the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR . In 1358 DR, Monique's childhood friend, Jared Jymn , one of Hillsfar's gladiators, was accused of murdering one of the castle's bodyguards and getting away from a handful of jewels. During the bodyguard's funeral, Monique met a dwarvish adventurer named Granite who was tasked with tracking the murderer down. She asked for the adventurer's help, believing her friend to be innocent. Subsequently, when Jared was found, he claimed that he was framed by Mordak Brelliar . However, it was unknown if the claims were true or if Jared Jymn was apprehended and convicted, or slain as there was a kill-on-sight order for him.</p>
<p>The abusive relationship with her parents led Monique to change her name to Blizzard and join a resistance group first thing after coming of age. She sought Maalthiir's downfall. The group's plot was uncovered by Maalthiir's agents, and every member of the resistance was executed, while Blizzard ended up being convicted to slavery and gladiatorial fights in the Hillsfar Arena. Sometime before the conviction in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Blizzard met and fell in love with the pirate of the Moonsea called Illandra. However, she became entangled in mage Maganus 's plot to bring the Moonsea to ruination. Illandra was mentally dominated by Eremuth Silverwind , the malaugrym who pretended to be an ally, while Blizzard was fighting for her life in the Arena. Illandra died at the hand of the same hero who aided Blizzard in escaping slavery in the Arena and defeated Orcus , who was unleashed onto the city of Zhentil Keep by Maganus.</p>
<p>Unable to bring herself to avenge Illandra's death, Blizzard left the Moonsea behind and traveled to the secluded region of Icewind Dale. Blizzard was plagued by dreams of her lover and nightmares of Jana , the Hero of Daggerford, pummeling Illandra to death. There, she forged an unlikely friendship with Arveiaturace , the White Wyrm of the Ice Peak . The two met during one of Arveiaturace's visits to her favorite Dragon's Dip lake when the ancient dragon swooped down from the skies and, instead of gobbling Blizzard up, offered conversation, noticing her being consumed by sadness. The two females bonded over the loss of their loved ones. Soon after, Blizzard found herself reluctantly joining the Hero of Neverwinter in their quest to recover the Hero's lost memories. On their adventure, Blizzard accompanied the Hero to Termalaine and lent her magical knowledge to rescuing the famed hero Wulfgar from being turned into a slab of ice by a flesh to ice spell. When the threat to Icewind Dale was revealed to be the imprisoned demigod son of Auril , Arveiaturace eagerly joined the growing army of the encroaching cold. The dragon may have convinced Blizzard to abandon the Hero of Neverwinter in favor of the shaman Iceblood and the demigod Arctus .</p>
