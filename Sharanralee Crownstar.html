<p>Sharanralee Crownstar was a human fighter , as well as a veteran member of the Harpers in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . After escaping her murderous relatives in Amn , her life began anew as an adventurer with Those Who Harp, venturing far and wide until she finally settled in Everlund alongside her husband, Eaerlraun Shadowlyn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sharanralee was a remarkably tall woman of 6 feet and 4 inches (190 centimeters), her form slender despite years of fighting experience. Her large, dark eyes matched the deep brown of her hair, which, when it was not done up, was said to easily fall somewhere around the back of her knees.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Despite her illustrious reputation among the Harpers, Sharanlee always carried herself with a measured level of poise. She was cheerful yet quiet, her tone kind regardless of whom she spoke to, all with a warm and melodious voice. Friendliness came naturally to her, as did her capacity to make anyone she talked to feel important, a comforting tendency that made most novice Harpers look up to her.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Notably, Sharanralee possessed a limitless and flawless memory. She remembered everything, from conversations she briefly overheard to the faces of those she met, and even the details of small objects, such as the blade of a key she merely glanced at. This also made her an excellent guide, capable of recalling the particulars of routes and settlements far away, and she often enjoyed comparing her maps to her memory, further correcting them.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>After her departure from Amn, Sharanralee never tried to take any sort of vengeance on her family. Rather, she pursued her work as a Harper with a passion and, eventually, her reputation among them was on par with that of even Mintiper Moonsilver , Storm Silverhand , or Elminster . Stories and songs about her exploits abounded.</p>
<p>Within the organization, Sharanralee grew particularly close to one of Storm's sisters, Alustriel , who was another senior Harper. She frequently served as one of Alustriel's trusted agents and, even beyond their work, the two grew to confide in each other as good friends.</p>
<h3>Lover</h3>
<p>At some point, Sharanralee also met and fell in love with the half-elf Eaerlraun Shadowlyn. He, too, was an experienced Harper, and their marriage was a strong and content one, with the couple both owning much land in Everlund. On the city's Westing Lane , they lived together in Slumberstone Tower .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>One of Sharanralee's most favored possessions was a small magic item that allowed her to freely change appearances. This not only benefited her work as a Harper but also her life in general, in situations wherein she might prefer to blend in rather than be recognized or, worse, pursued. As a Harper proper, Sharanralee was also given a magical anklet by Alustriel for use in emergencies. It enabled her to communicate with anyone else wearing such an anklet, whether that be Alustriel herself, her sons called the Tall Ones , or Cylyria Dragonbreast , another Harper contact in Berdusk .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>During her lunch hours, Sharanralee would sometimes meet with Alustriel in Everlund's quiet gardens.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>An Amnian Childhood</h3>
<p>Sharanralee Crownstar, named after her late grandmother, was born the sole inheritor to her father's fortune in Amn's capital of Athkatla . He, Taerazaun Crownstar , was the head of the Crownstar family and their mercantile fortune, whereas Sharanralee's mother, Miralee , was a beautiful woman of dark skin who came from Mintarn .</p>
<p>Unfortunately, during a voyage outside the country, both Taerazaun and Miralee were killed by bandits who raided their caravan. The young Sharanralee, having been left in their mansion back in Athkatla, was supposedly safe and tended to by their relatives and servants. It became readily apparent, however, that her being orphaned gave these same caretakers a unique opportunity, one to steal the Crownstar family's riches by discrediting Sharanralee. This did not deter the girl from living her life as she knew it. Every time they forced her out of the mansion, she would return, climbing back in through the upper floors' windows and pretending it had never happened. This pushed the would-be thieves to resort to the extreme: assassination.</p>
<p>This, too, Sharanralee managed to avoid–for a while. One of her uncles began to consider another plan, wherein a stableman would spirit her away to the mountains. The agreement was that this man would be allowed to have his twisted way with her, so long as he slew her afterwards and returned bearing her heart and eyes to confirm her death. Little did they know that Sharanralee herself, hiding nearby, heard everything.</p>
<h3>A Harper's Life</h3>
<p>It was this that spurred her to leave her home behind, until she eventually found herself under the care of the Harpers. They taught her their ways and allowed her to explore the wilderness of Toril , often accompanied by those of like interests, such as other explorers or even rangers .</p>
<p>Her distinguished career included, at some point, a visit to Daggerdale . There, at the behest of the local lord, Randal Morn , Sharanralee spirited away the young Talantra Bowgentle , escorting her all the way to Silverymoon . She also served as Elsura Dauniir 's teacher and guide through the backlands of the North , though she ultimately felt that the young woman's cat-like moodiness was at odds with the Harpers' approach.</p>
<p>During the Year of the Spur, 1348 DR , Sharanralee met with both Mirt the Moneylender and Tarthus the wizard , two powerful figures of Waterdeep . Though the trio deliberated on possible tactics in a high, warded tower, they were unwittingly being observed by Old Ghost through the Sword That Never Sleeps , who wished to absorb their souls into the magical blade—alongside his own. Luckily, his attentions were taken elsewhere before he could make his attempt on the lives of Sharanralee and her allies.</p>
<p>She continued to adventure into the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . By then, Sharanralee could still be found in the North, where the surging numbers of orcs and other, greater foes kept her and Eaerlraun well-occupied as they worked out of Everlund.</p>
