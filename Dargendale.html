<p>Dargendale was a small settlement in the Dalelands , surrounded by thick woods, protected from poachers by the local law.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Dargendale was an obscure settlement of common and superstitious folk. Surrounded by woods, the locals believed that the elusive White Stag of Dargendale was an omen of good luck.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before 1372 DR , a rich hunter Worlges the Black managed to capture the favorite local beast - the White Stag. The hunter killed and stuffed the animal, the act that angered the local peasantry. Eventually, this unrest inspired a traveling druid to reanimate the taxidermy stag, which exacted its revenge on the hunter, leaving him dead and skewered by the stuffed beast's antlers.</p>
<p>Eventually, the stuffed White Stag of Dargendale was moved away from the Dalelands and found home in Torleth's Treasures of Gillian's Hill in i372 DR.</p>
