<p>Nacacia was a female half-elf slave in Myth Drannor , in service to the Masked , and a caster during the laying of the mythal .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She'd been bubbly and pranksome when she started her apprenticeship. However, by the end of it, she was no longer a prankster. She remained merry and bright, though.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As of 324 DR , she had long auburn hair and a surprisingly strong back. She most often wore black breeches and a vest.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>She could cast one lashing lightning spell that struck many, almost certainly lightning bolt , and magic missile . One of her spells, which she often used for her master's pleasure, animated her hair; she also worked spells in spell-webs created by her master.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Her master, Llombaerth Starym , always known as the Masked, often called on her to animate her hair for his entertainment in evenings at his chambers. Though she flirted with Elminster Aumar , the master's other apprentice, her master actively crushed any flirting and punished them severely for it. She became the latter's paramour at some point between 261 DR and 650 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nacacia was a young half-elf in Cormanthyr before the Opening ; she was brought by the Masked to his tower as a young lass, sometime after he began tutoring the human Elminster Aumar in the ways of the Elven High Magic . He taught her too, in order to use them as his instruments.</p>
<p>At one point, The Masked tricked Elminster into using Nacacia's life in a lifequench spell to block out Mythanthar 's magic, so as to assassinate him more easily. Though Elminster believed he'd actually killed her and was unaware that Mythanthor was inside, unknown to him, Mythanthar had blocked the spell and made her only appear to be dead through a seeming ; this was revealed later, when the Masked, revealed to be Llombaerth Starym, attempted to frame Elminster at the Coronal's court. Later, when Llombaerth unleashed his coup against the Coronal, she helped Elminster to break free from one of his spells, and even cast a few spells in support of the Coronal.</p>
<p>Later, Nacacia helped to raise the mythal . She was admitted to the innermost ring of casters, becoming one of the tertiary casters who imbued minor powers in it.</p>
