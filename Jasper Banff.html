<p>Jasper Banff was a priest of Tempus who lived within the deity's temple located in the Cloud Peak Mountains .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the avatar of Tempus appeared in far-off Battledale during the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR , Jasper and some of his fellow comrades heeded the call of their deity. They left the safety of their home in Amn for the Dalelands far to the east.</p>
<p>When they returned to their temple nearly a decade later, in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , they found their brethren were slain and the holy site taken over by Gamaz and other monks of the Order of the Dark Moon . Before he could escape from the worshipers of Shar , Jasper was imprisoned behind a cage that was magically sealed and could only be opened by answering a riddle.</p>
