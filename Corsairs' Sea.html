<p>The Principality of the Corsairs' Sea was the northwestern principality of Tethyr , the official domain of the heir to the throne, and the original homeland of the Tethyrian tribes.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Located north of the Starspire Mountains , the principality encompassed the Dragon's Neck Peninsula and the Forest of Tethir . The territory officially contained three duchies — Cape Velen , Noromath , and Durmista —yet the latter two were not directly controlled by the queen , being the home of the elves of Wealdath .</p>
<p>Though it covered a large portion of land, most of the Principality of the Corsairs' Sea was forested and thus sparsely populated. The most notable city in the region was Velen .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>On paper , the principality was ruled in 1370 DR by the heir to the throne of Tethyr, the Princess Sybille Rhindaun . However, as she was only a small child at that time, her authority passed to her regent and father, King Haedrak Rhindaun III .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The founding twelve clans of Tethyr originated in this region.</p>
