<p>Scalping was the act of cutting or tearing a part of an animal or humanoid creature's scalp , with hair attached, from its head, oftentimes leaving the skull exposed. This was typically considered to be a morally evil and despicable act to commit, with some evil individuals keeping a collection of them as trophies of their deeds. However, some took a more neutral view of the practice depending upon the circumstances, seeing it as an acceptable means of providing evidence that one had vanquished a foe with a bounty.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The act of scalping was known on Toril as far back as the Netherese Empire , as the Rengarth barbarians would commit the act upon their enemies.</p>
<p>In the mid-14 th century DR , this tortuous act was committed by some in the Sword Coast upon bandits , such as members of the mercenary company Chill . Some half-ogres in the Calim Desert committed scalping, stringing their victims' scalps around the heads of their spears . And some alchemists within Zhentil Keep around this time were known to exclusively pay for hybsil antlers that were still attached to their scalp, believing this assured their magical efficacy.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , officer Jessa Vai of the Flaming Fist offered to pay the adventurer Gorion's Ward a bounty of 50 gold pieces per bandit scalp they gave to her while she stayed in Beregost .</p>
<p>Around the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , in the land of Turmish a group of mercenaries lead by Druz Talimsir traveled into the forest near Evenstar Lake and scalped a number of wolves for a bounty. Their corpses were soon after discovered by the druid Haarn Brightoak , who tracked down and confronted the mercenaries, demanding they hand over their bag of scalps.</p>
