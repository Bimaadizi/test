<p>The Thunder Peaks were a range of mountains that ran in a north–south line, marking the eastern edge of Cormyr . The entire range was subject to extremely severe and sudden storms all year round. They were home to tribes of orcs and goblins that launched raids in nearby Cormyr, Sembia , and the Dalelands , and were also home to the dracolich Aurgloroasa , the Sibilant Shade. The Thunder Peaks once hosted the dwarven settlement of Thunderholme .</p>
<p>The Thunder River flowed west out of the Thunder Peaks to the Wyvernwater . In Elven , the Thunder Peaks were called Airmbult , or translated into Common , Storm-Fangs.</p>
<h2>Flora</h2>
<p>The mountains had a number of unique species of plants, including the turis and kirin trees , as well as Bowen's flowers . The scent of the heavily aromatic ateris plants would blow down to the town of Tilverton with strong winds.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to the Treatise Historical of the Dragon Tyrants , after the first Rage of Dragons , their kobold servitors were all but destroyed in the rampaging chaos of their masters. Kuraulyek , a dragonwrought kobold , led his winged kin to safety in the Thunder Peaks, escaping the dragons' wrath in the bat-filled caverns.</p>
