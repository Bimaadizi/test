<h2>History</h2>
<p>Balismo was a noble of Calimport who, at the Amnian court, decided to join the expedition to Maztica . However, arriving in Helmsport , he was set to act as an overseer. Instead, he wanted to lead an expedition to find some gold and many times Balismo spoke to Lord Drakosa about this.</p>
