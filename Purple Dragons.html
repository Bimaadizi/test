<p>The Purple Dragons were the famous military of Cormyr that were renowned for their discipline, skill, and loyalty.</p>
<p>The Purple Dragons were well renowned for their heroism and acts of valor in the field of combat.</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>A typical Purple Dragon wore field plate armor and a steel helmet. Over this, they wore a tabard with the symbol of a purple dragon. Higher ranking members were allowed to wear their family's crest on their uniform or shield as well. They could fight with any melee weapon but most often were armed with long swords .</p>
<h2>Recruitment and Training</h2>
<p>All loyal Cormyrean citizens were eligible to join the Purple Dragons by taking an oath. Although the oath was available to non-humans provided they are Cormyrean citizens, extra measures may have been imposed on non-humans to ensure their loyalty, due to the fact that Cormyr was predominantly human.</p>
<p>Nobles were actively expected to take the oath, and would generally be given positions of leadership. Non-nobles would form part of the militia with an initial service of two years. After the two-year service, the Purple Dragon chose to continue their role, or return their former life. Barring any administrative snafus, they were approached by their commanding officer, and asked if they wished to continue serving the Dragon Throne.</p>
<p>If answered with affirmation, another interview follows, joined by a War Wizard (who may remain hidden). If the Purple Dragon had requested new responsibilities or locations, the interview came all the sooner. The War Wizard employed mind reading magic (not as harsh as Mind Reaming ) to confirm happiness with the upcoming assignment. As the command officer was not around for this interview, this presented an opportunity to ask the Purple Dragon about their contentment with the assignment, enquire about re-assignments (not guaranteed), or let them comment on their conditions.</p>
<p>In times of conflict, any who left after the abovementioned 2 years could be called back into service.</p>
<h3>Training</h3>
<p>The first six months consisted of an extensive training regime before starting active duty, such as patrolling Cormyr's borders or guarding its cities and towns.</p>
<p>Training could take one of three paths, including basic combat training, leadership training, or training in the protection of key personnel, often War Wizards . Training was conducted in a range of weapons, and covered subjects such as defense of others and battlefield awareness, in addition to basic combat training.</p>
<h2>Structure and Hierarchy</h2>
<h3>Ranks</h3>
<p>The Purple Dragons had specific titles for the members of their army, listed here from lowest to highest.</p>
<p>Other titles and positions included:</p>
<p>The Lord High Marshall in 1374 DR , also known as the Warden of the North, was Lord Dauneth Marliir . Lord Marliir was commissioned by the King for his loyalty and dedication to the Crown. He was based in the city of Arabel , where his personal estate lay. [ citation needed ]</p>
<h3>Related Organisations</h3>
<p>The Purple Dragons often worked in tandem with the War Wizards - in the battlefield, at checkpoints, and in patrols.</p>
<p>The Bodyguard Royal and Purple Dragon knights consisted of some of the most premier Purple Dragons. The Knights Royal and Highknights would also often find themselves in their close proximity.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Precursors</h3>
<p>Cormyr was once part of the woodland empire of Cormanthyr , where elves and dragons fought for dominance. The most prominent of these was the black dragon Thauglor , who was so old that his scales had acquired a purple hue. After the Cormyreans later defeated Thauglor and took the land for themselves, the purple-tinged scales of Thauglor would inspire the name of the Purple Dragons.</p>
<p>In the 420s DR, the Purple Dragons were originally an adventuring company comprising several Cormyrean nobles: Elvarin Crownsilver , Glorin Truesilver , Jotor Turcassan , Omalra Dracohorn , and Dintheron Bleth . Then, when the kingdom collapsed after the treacherous Melineth Turcassan sold the city of Suzail to the pirate lord Magrath the Minotaur in the Year of the Cat's Eye, 429 DR , the Purple Dragons remained loyal to King Duar "Longyears" Obarskyr . They formed the core of a rebel army under the king's command, together with Amedahast and a dwindling number of rank-and-file soldiers following them. They strove for three long years to retake Cormyr from the pirate lord and the traitors that had allied themselves with him.</p>
<p>The increasingly ragtag band had great difficulty retaking the nation even though they had the full support of Cormyr's commoners. In the Year of the Sea Princes, 432 DR , another loyalist unit managed to take High Horn and the soldiers inside agreed to pledge themselves to the king if the Purple Dragons could win a single victory by themselves. Duar and Amedahast chose the remote Dheolur , the hold of one of the traitorous noble families. With the help of a farmer named Dhedluk (whom Dheolur was later named after), and Threena Cormaeril , the group stormed the main building. Magrath was being entertained there at the time, which allowed King Duar to kill the minotaur. This dealt a crippling blow to the traitors and earned the Dragons the allegiance of High Horn's troops, who helped to quickly bring the realm under Duar's rightful control.</p>
<p>Although not explicitly stated, the royal army was most likely named in honor of this group. [ speculation ]</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>In battlefields, the Purple Dragons were rarely pitted against fortifications. Thus, they had little use for siege machines , and often relied on War Wizards ' spells.</p>
<p>Purple Dragon Officers maintained an environment of excitement by sending their subordinates to surprise missions. This was done to stymie inactivity, agitation, or general dissatisfaction - all of which could lead to mischief or misplaced loyalties.</p>
<p>An old tradition within the Purple Dragons involved speedy creation of "strike cavalry" units, and filling its roster with nobles who sought laurels, but lacked temperance and experience in equal measure. These "special forces" served as excellent diversions and cannon fodder.</p>
<h2>Leaving the Purple Dragons</h2>
<p>It was advisable to communicate one's departure to a War Wizard, often with the profession of divine dreams that preached pacifism. The War Wizard may not have believed such claims, but they would be unlikely to object or admonish such claims openly.</p>
<p>Barring an urgent need for their service (such as floods or dragon sightings), an amicable debriefing soon followed. The Purple Dragon informed their superiors of pending work or otherwise important matters, and was provided with sufficient food, equipment, and coinage. Ever since the Royal Magician Caladnei and Filfaeril Obarskyr , great care was placed into not straining relationships, as disgruntled Dragons could find themselves in bed with Sembia or disloyal nobles.</p>
<h3>Retirement</h3>
<p>Purple Dragons that served for a cumulative 12 years or more could retire as " grayswords ". They qualified for being healed, cured of diseases, as well as getting any missing limbs restored. A test for lycanthropy followed (with treatment, if needed). Grayswords could bear weapons without need of peace-bonds or charters. Grayswords were offered the choice between a pension of 6 gold coins a month, and a "glint" / "pepper" pension of 2 gold coins a month alongwith a land grant. Such lands were usually along the Sembian border & coast, or along the High Road facing Tunlands . This served the crown well, for the civilisation and protection of such areas was desired.</p>
<p>An early retirement as a graysword was rare, but granted if the Purple Dragon underwent severe trauma, or grew sick of their work after dispensation of noteworthy deeds.</p>
<p>If the Purple Dragon lacked discipline (but was loyal to Cormyr or a good combatant) or the Crown had too many Purple Dragons, an honourable discharge could follow. A lumpsum payment of 10 gold coins was provided, no honour was considered lost, and the tenure served could counted towards the aforementioned 12 years for an eventual full retirement.</p>
<p>If subjected to dishonourable discharge or an outright dismissal, a Purple Dragon faced exile or deprivation of any pension & respect. This was usually the case when the crown did not wish to punish them, or could not validate their wrongdoings.</p>
<h3>Re-Enlistment</h3>
<p>In principle, it was possible to "wear the Purple" again. Frequent enlistments and departures from the Purple Dragon ranks, however, were looked upon with scrutiny.</p>
<p>Such aspirants had to approach a standing garrison larger than a mere watchpost or waypost. A War Wizard and an officer would then ask why the former Purple Dragon wished to serve again. Given sufficient cause for suspicion, the War Wizard employed Mind reaming to ensure no blackmail, magical coercion, or subterfuge was at play. The applicant was asked where and how they wish to serve once more, but their assignment could very well be otherwise.</p>
<p>Generally, they were assigned to one rank lower than as they had left (unless they were a Blade - the lowest rank). After a period of good service (usually a "season"), they found themselves at their original rank and salary.</p>
