<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The village of Shen consisted of approximately 250 orcs of the White Hand clan circa 1370 DR . The settlement stood four miles north of the Wintercloak River and was locked in a conflict with vegepygmies that dwelled south of the river. The war raged in the forest in the late-14 th century DR and made it a dangerous travel destination.</p>
