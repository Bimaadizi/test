<h2>History</h2>
<p>In late Mirtul of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Kormoroth was plotting against King Foril Obarskyr I of Cormyr. He was supported by a Westgate -aligned cabal that meant to slay the king and then gain a foothold in the ruling of Cormyr by allying with the nobles that rose to power instead. He and his minions attacked the mansion of a member of a rival conspiracy with similar aims, Andranth Glarvreth during a dinner in which he hosted the nobleman Olgarth Oldbridle looking for an alliance. The guest's bodyguard, Burrath , killed Kormoroth moments after he slew Olgarth; Andranth Glarvreth escaped.</p>
