<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He could hurl fire.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lhaerand was among the Frostfire Banner when they took on High Duke Horostos 's assignment to search for the reason why all animals larger than one's hand, as well as most people, were vanishing on the road between Starmantle and Ripplestones .</p>
<p>On their first night on the road from Starmantle, they were ambushed by a chiming mist, the Slayer . Lhaerand woke up when Paeregur called everyone awake; only he and Phostral were still alive at that point. Paeregur asked him to hurl fire at the phantom, but after seeing it disintegrate Phostral into nothing, Lhaerand instead ran all the way to the cliffside and jumped. Paeregur heard him hit the earth, presumably killed.</p>
