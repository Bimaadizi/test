<p>Brokenstone Vale was an isolated valley in the Feywild .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This valley was a maze of heavily forested ravines and steep hills, with a variety of old castle and tower ruins. A rushing river winded across the valley's mark and had stone posts on the far side of it that marked Brokenstone's boundary. Underneath the valley was an entrance to the fomorian kingdom of Harrowhame .</p>

<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>Wolfsbane grew on the mountain slopes of this valley.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Centuries prior to the Spellplague , a werewolf lord forged a kingdom of lycanthropes in this valley and waged a fierce, brutal war with the neighboring eladrin realms. This area of the Feywild was conceded to lycanthropes and shapechangers in an ancient pact with a parliament of archfey known as the Court of Stars . Their pact ensured that no creature could set foot in this valley without the permission of the resident lycanthropes, and entering without it would make their life forfeit. Conversely, the pact also dictated that any lycanthrope that hunted beyond the valley would be hunted by an archfey known as the Maiden of the Moon .</p>
<p>As the centuries passed, many werebeast rulers would raise keeps or halls within castles or towers. These would go on to become ruins that littered the valley.</p>
<p>Over time the lycanthropes of the valley felt chafed by their ancient pact and began to hunt far beyond the valley. Some in the Feywild would be inspired by the Maiden of the Moon to take up arms, hunting down such lycanthropes. Some lycanthropes swore fealty to Bronnor , the king of Harrowhame, plotting to one day ambush the Maiden of the Moon and put an end to her, while others had a loose alliance with the fomorian queen Connomae .</p>
<p>Following the Spellplague, some of the lycanthropes that had formed an alliance with Connomae made their way to the island of Moray on the Prime Material world of Toril and became members of the Black Blood tribe .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>This valley was primarily inhabited by lycanthropes. Some gathered within clans or tribes, but most lived solitary lives and kept to themselves. Many barbarian berserkers could be found among these tribes. Most of the lycanthropes in this valley rarely bothered to disguise their true nature. Some lived within the ruined structures built for werebeast lords of yore. Some lycanthropes were druids that gathered high in the mountains near fey crossroads , believing that the key to controlling their urges lied with primal spirits .</p>
<p>Occasionally outsiders came to the valley to live as hermits. Non-lycanthropes lived high in its mountain, hunting in the woods by day and farming the lower mountain slopes. They would paint a silver stripe across their home to signal that they have silver and the protection of the Maiden of the Moon. Some would also display wolfsbane around their home as a deterrent.</p>
<p>Some lycanthropes within the valley acted as assassins or spies of Harrowhame's king.</p>
