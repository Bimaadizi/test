<p>Lester was an uncle to Nevin from the City of Coin, Athkatla , the capital of Amn in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lester died in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , after a lifetime of mistreating his nephew Nevin, by the younger man's own accords. Lester left all his con to his Calishite mistress, and Nevin received a sweater that once belonged to Nevin's grandfather. Disgruntled by being mistreated even after death, Nevin organized a cheap funeral in Athkatla's Grave District . The ceremony was performed by a drunken cleric of Talos , but something went wrong. Uncle Lester rose up as an undead creature, sending the ceremony's attendees fleeing. Lester, now a ghoul , scolded Nevin for spending just a new coppers on the ceremony with the eulogy being some slurred lines of profanity mumbled by an inebriated priest, all clothes from the dead body were sold off, and even the flowers were gathered from a nearby swamp. Nevin angrily stated that he had no money to spend and Lester should've been simply dumped into the city river. It was said that the undead became enraged and swiftly murdered his nephew and went off searching for his Calishite paramour for a "one last quickie," while others claimed that an adventurer witnessed the strange exchange and defended the man from his reanimated family member.</p>
