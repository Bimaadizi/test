<p>Prophia Copperfire was a renowned half-elven bard and traveler who crossed Toril and the planes long before the late 13 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Long before the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , Prophia Copperfire owned the unique enchanted instrument called The Merry Shorthorn . She carried the instrument with her across Faerûn , and some even claimed the flute accompanied its mistress to the elemental planes , Elysium , and even Baator . She was known to have traveled across the Spine of the World and reached the distant nation of Wa . She entertained pashas of Calimshan , softened hearts of angry holy slayers in Zakhara , and was sung along by boisterous sailors of the Sea of Fallen Stars . Subsequently, The Merry Shorthorn was lost somewhere in the hot sands of Anauroch and Prophia's fate after that remained unknown.</p>
