<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sages of Toril knew about some of the hero Scaldulin's feats and heroics on a distant world of Greyhawk. The hero discovered the Hoarfrost Blade plugged into the heart of a glacier. He wielded the enchanted blade through several major conquests of his career. He used the blade's magics that punished extraplanar creatures to stand against a demon army in the Battle of the Thousand Dead , at some point later, the hero sliced the hand of a dreaded lich Scaroth the Warped of Blackmoor .</p>
<p>Scaldulin's heroics ended with him being transformed into a death knight and slaughter of a solar named Arazium . His final fate remained unknown to scholars of Toril, but the Hoarfrost Blade found its way to Faer√ªn in 1372 DR , broken and scattered across Delimbiyr Vale .</p>
