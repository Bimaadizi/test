<p>The Red Bazaar was a major marketplace located in the Market Ward of Port Nyanzaru , Chult . It was where the city's residents shopped for their daily needs.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The marketplace consisted of broad rows of colorful stands that dominated the Market Ward east of the Grand Coliseum and south of the Hall of Gold . Nearby the market were two of the most notable inns in the city: the Thundering Lizard and Kaya's House of Repose .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Red Bazaar was largely a marketplace of locals buying and selling necessities, trade goods, and household products to other locals. This included trade in clothing , insect repellent (both in the form of incense and salves ), rain catchers , tej , alchemist's supplies , and food (such as local fruits , vegetables , and meats, including dinosaur meat).</p>
<p>Merchants seeking to sell their wares, as well as customers seeking special orders, were directed to the Master of the Market. As of the late 15 th century DR , this position was held by Terrah Initoo .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The origins of the name of the Red Bazaar were lost to history. The people's best guess was that it was named for the blood that stained the marketplace's gutters, which was a product of the huge pieces of dinosaur meat processed there.</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, the Red Bazaar was one of the three most important marketplaces within Port Nyanzaru, the other two being the Grand Souk and the Jewel Market . The eclectic mix of products for sale meant that several of the city's merchant princes had a stake in the business of the bazaar, most notably including Kwayoth√© and Ekene-Afa .</p>
<p>During the events of the death curse , one of the Bazaar's merchants was Giregi Igiri , who specialized in alchemical ingredients and products.</p>
