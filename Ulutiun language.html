<p>Ulutiun was a language spoken by the Ulutiun people of the Great Glacier .</p>
<h2>Speakers</h2>
<p>Ulutiun was spoken by the easternmost branch of Ulutiuns who lived on the Great Glacier . The Ulutiuns known as " Ice Hunters ", who lived on the Sea of Moving Ice , spoke Uluik , although some scholars did not differentiate between these two High Ulutim languages .</p>
<p>The three tribes of Ulutiuns—the Iulutiuns , the Angulutiuns , and the Nakulutiuns —had their own tribal dialects of Ulutiun, but these were mutually intelligible.</p>
<h2>Vocabulary</h2>
<p>Ulutiun supposedly had about twelve different words for various kinds of snow and no words at all for sand.</p>
<h2>Script</h2>
<p>The Ulutiuns of the Great Glacier had only been using the Thorass alphabet to write their language for a few centuries by 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Related languages</h2>
<p>As discussed above, Uluik was very closely related to the Ulutiun language. Both were distantly related to Damaran and Halruaan .</p>
