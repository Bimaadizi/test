<p>Shadystreets was a poor neighborhood within the western side of the Crow's End district in Ravens Bluff on the northern bank of the Fire River . While the grubby, dockside locale was full of thieves and criminals, it was home to a few diamonds in the rough.</p>
<p>The dilapidated wooden houses that lined the garbage-filled streets closest to the river were held together with planks ripped from destroyed ships. Vermin and urchins ran rampant in the neighborhood, causing most visitors in the neighborhood to avoid straying far from Stonestreet Concourse when crossing the Ravensbridge .</p>
