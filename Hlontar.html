<p>Hlontar was a lost realm situated around the river Tesh and reaching as far south as Shadowdale .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hlontar was founded by the wizard Alokkair , who came from one of the survivor states of Netheril after they had been swallowed by Anauroch . Alokkair supported the warrior Hlonagh in subduing rival warlords in the region and founding the kingdom of Hlontar in the Year of the Laughing Lich, 536 DR . Alokkair served as Hlonagh's court wizard for a time. Finally, Alokkair slew Hlonagh and became wizard-king of Hlontar himself. Alokkair's rule was cruel and ruthless.</p>
<p>In 569 DR , Alokkair's three daughters led a rebellion against him. Only the youngest survived, forcing Alokkair into hiding in a secret refuge in southern Hlontar—a cave in the Fox Ridge of Shadowdale.</p>
<p>Alokkair had long-term plans to reinstall himself as ruler of Hlontar and considered the Zhentarim to be squatters in his kingdom even in 1375 DR .</p>
