<p>Bani Matruj al-Haddar , or the Silent Sheikh , was a goblin barber living in Liham in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Bani was talkative to the point where he would continue to talk until gagged. He preferred to stay in one place, but due to his penchant for gossip he often had to move cities to get away from annoyed customers.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bani's flat face was accompanied by a broad nose, pointed ears, wide mouth, and sharp fangs. He stood 4 ft (1.2 m) tall. His skin was dull red and he had yellow eyes.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The barber actively avoided the holy slayer Anwar al-Sifr .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Bani enjoyed drawing out the time he spent with customers. He would often stop grooming them halfway so he could draw up an astrological chart for them. He also offered free fortune-telling sessions, but did not have much success doing so.</p>
<p>He was an excellent source of information on the happenings of Liham.</p>
