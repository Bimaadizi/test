<p>Art Appraisal was a book with a self-explanatory title, penned by Gonner Maude and published sometime in or before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>The book combined musings and autobiographical elements from Gonner's childhood. One day, when the author was still a single-year-old child living in the City of Splendors, Waterdeep , Gonner's mother informed him that his stepfather had gone mad. The author assumed that it was more of an artistic obsession – a man locking himself in the studio, painting for three days straight, but it was not the case. The artist stepfather attacked the author's mother with a sharpened brush. As such, Gonner Maude stated that the art was a funny thing. The book continued on talking about Mitcher and Webson 's thoughts and definition of what art was and how it replicated real life, whilst great art overcame life.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a copy of Art Appraisal could be found in one of the homes of the Jannath patriar family in Baldur's Gate 's Lower City .</p>
