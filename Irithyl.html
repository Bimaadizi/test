<p>Irithyl was a royal gold elven family that ruled over the Empire of Cormanthyr , a great kingdom of elves in the forest of Cormanthor , from the nation's founding in −4000 DR onward through 661 DR . The Irithyl clan was an old founding family of Arcorar and among the first Twelve Houses of Cormanthyr.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the year −4000 DR , the Coronal of Jhyrennstar , Oacenth , spoke a prophecy that the elves of the nations of the forest of Arcorar would unify together and form one great nation. It was at this time that the Elfblades were created to determine its rulers, and the competing elven clans sent their leaders forth to draw the blades as part of the ritual of Blade-rite . The Ruler's Blade, which determined the Coronal of Cormanthyr, was drawn by the first of the Irithyl line, Kahvoerm, and so began the first Rysar of Cormanthyr. Kahvoerm is remembered for also having founded the city of Cormanthor, which later became Myth Drannor, in the year -3983 , and raising the Rule Tower as part of Castle Cormanthor , the seat of power of the empire.</p>
<p>Kahvoerm ruled for over a thousand years. In −2900 DR , he finally passed upon placing his selu'taar upon the blade. His fourth son, Divisav was first to attempt to draw the sword, but was consumed in green fire, determined unworthy on account of greed. So, the blade passed to Sakrattars , youngest of Kahvoerm's great-grandsons, beginning the second Rysar. Sakrattars fought drow throughout his reign, facing the rise of the Twisted Tower in -2549 , the infamous Spiderfires that consumed much of the Rystall Wood in −2539 DR , and a major incursion into the western woods in −1950 DR which ultimately claimed his life, when he sacrificed his body to create a blood dragon to slay the drow. His chosen heir Sinaht Irithyl drew the blade and began the third Rysar in the Irithyl line.</p>
<p>Sinaht ruled for only six some centuries, and led a notable campaign against the drow of the Twisted Tower alongside the Coronal of Rystall Wood in −1354 DR , routing much of the dark elves from the former lands of Uvaeren but failing to take the Tower. Sinaht died in −1338 DR , passing on the fourth Rysar to Miirphys Irithyl, a priest of Sehanine Moonbow .</p>
<p>The fourth Coronal Miirphys ruled peacefully for many years, and is most notable for being the Coronal who imprisoned the Trio Nefarious, a band of nycaloths released by a Netherese wizard. The demons rampaged around the countryside for three months before a climactic battle in the streets of Cormanthor, where they were finally imprisoned by the Coronal and his High Mages in −1200 DR . The rule of Cormanthyr passed on to Tannivh in −791 DR , and Miirphys died ignorant to the damage that the demons he imprisoned would one day enact.</p>
<p>Tannivh ruled for over five centuries and is most notable for having finally routed the dark elves from the Twisted Tower with the help of Rystall Wood in −331 DR , marking the end of the Shadow Wars . The tower was handed over to priests of Eilistraee for safekeeping. Tannivh died in −223 DR , passing on the Coronalship to his son, Eltargrim, sixth and last of the Irithyl Coronals.</p>
<p>Eltargrim, the last of the Irithyl line to rule Cormanthyr, was a great leader most well known for creating the mythal over Cormanthor, dubbing it Myth Drannor and opening the realm and the city to non-elves for the first time in its history in 261 DR . This event commenced a long era of prosperity for the elves and their capital city as culture, art, and science flourished in Cormanthyr, despite the grumblings of its nobles, upset over Eltargrim's choices. Eltargrim was a warrior at heart, having spent over three centuries in the Akh'Velahr , the military of Cormanthyr, and wore his tattoos openly (a black sword on his left hand, a four-ringed rank marking on his palm, and a crossed-swords medal on his left forearm. He was a man of great wisdom and regarded all races equally.</p>
<p>Eltargrim died in 661 DR , leaving his grand-niece, Aravae Irithyl, the only heir to the throne and the Irithyl Dynasty. Eltargrim passed in peace knowing that his dream of racial unity and peace under the woods of Cormanthyr had been achieved. He had lived a fruitful life of over twelve centuries and though sustained by the mythal he erected, he chose to pass to Arvandor . As was his custom, he rose to the top of the Rule Tower in the morning to greet the sun, only this time he was clad in his warrior's armour and drew his Elfblade and pointed it at the sun. While chanting a great song in which all of Myth Drannor joined, he climbed like a phantom into the rays of the sun and disappeared, leaving behind his sword for the next worthy Coronal.</p>
<p>With Eltargrim passed, the Irithyl line came to an end. The chosen heir, Aravae, had declared a five-year mourning period for her uncle, as she was not prepared to draw the blade until her lost love, Josidiah Starym , had returned from his mission to find the lost Warblade . Her stalling method ended up being the death of her family's dynasty, as she was murdered only three years into the period, in 664 DR . The Coronalship became open and no heir was left in the family.</p>
