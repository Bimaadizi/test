This concealed her transformed shark skin.</p>

<h2>Relationships</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR , when the Edificant Library was assaulted by agents of Castle Trinity with the Chaos Curse , Pertelope lost herself in her affinity for sharks, resulting in maintaining a featureless torso covered by a shark skin with sharp-edged pentacles. Being half-human and half-shark made breathing air as poisonous to her as water. She eventually passed away peacefully at Cadderly's side because of this.</p>
