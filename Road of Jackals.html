<p>The Road of Jackals was a pass through the Scimitar Spires , known to the ancient Netherese as Humaithira.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Road was one of two passes that cut through the Scimitar Spires, along with the Gap of Skulls . It was located towards the southern end of the Scimitar Spires, and could shorten a journey past the mountains by at least a hundred miles.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Humaithira served as the location of the Last Stand at Humaithira in 2298 NY (−1561 DR) , which saw several hundred Netherese soldiers led by Strategor Matick fight against the giants of Thane Blóta . Though Matick was slain and the pass taken by the giants, the heroic sacrifice allowed a later Netherese army to ultimately defeat the army of giants.</p>
<p>By the 14 th century DR , few Bedine had explored the pass, and thus not many could make their way through the Road of Jackals.</p>
<p>At some point around 1368 DR , a number of caravans went missing trying to find another way across the mountains.</p>
