<p>Thasunta , also known as the City of Warriors or the City of Berserkers , was a bustling settlement in Rashemen that served as the home to many of its famous Rashemaar berserkers .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The city's position at the juncture between the two major roads passing through Rashemen made it an ideal location to mobilize military forces. It lay at the intersection of the Golden Way and the road that ran north to Mulptan .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Thasunta was not directly governed by the Iron Lord directly, but rather by the most venerated of Rashemen's berserker lodges, the Old Lodge . This select order took its members only from amongst the nation's wisest and most battle-hardened warriors.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>During many months of the year Thasunta was not much more than a stopping place for farmers and merchants to sell their wares while traveling along Golden Way .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Despite its seemingly mundane nature, Thasunta actually housed over hundreds of berserkers that hailed from a dozen of the nation's major lodges. Throughout Rashemen's history, these berserkers defended their nation against invasion forces dispatched by the malevolent southern nation of Thay .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The berserkers of Thasunta were vital to Rashemen's victory at the Battle of the Lake of Tears against the Grand Army of the Tuigan in the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR .</p>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the forces of Thasunta underwent plans to invade the hills of the High Country and drive out its population of monstrous humanoids .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Regardless of the typical dislike of cities by the Rashemaar, citizens of Thasunta were held in high-regard if for no other reason that they were all believed to be some manner of berserker warrior. While this was a mere exaggeration the residents of Thasunta did little to dissuade others of its belief.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>The city was home to the great ale-hall of the White Dragon lodge , the largest one of its kind in all of Rashemen.</p>
