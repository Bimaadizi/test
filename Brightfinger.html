<p>Brightfinger was a Netherese arcanist that was known for his development of light-based spells .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>This variator was interested in spells that had more practical than destructive uses. He was astonished that the archwizards of Netheril didn't feel the same way.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Brightfinger was born in 2141 NY (−1718 DR) . Growing up with a priest , he sought to develop utility spells that were commonly used by clerics. In 2207 NY (−1652 DR) , Brightfinger developed the light spell. Five years later, he created the light-based spell that was known as Brightfinger's dancers , though it eventually became known as dancing lights . His peers commended his skill, and Brightfinger started to develop a version that would suddenly explode once someone approached it, though it is unknown if he ever completed its formulation.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that his peers were impressed by his magical skill, he never chose to become an archwizard . Instead, he settled in Canlespiere . Brightfinger would be hunted down by the Ashwind Assassins for three years straight, until he met his demise in 2373 NY (−1486 DR) .</p>
