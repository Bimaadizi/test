<p>Blackhorn Alley was a hard-packed dirt and gravel alleyway in the Trades Ward of Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This road ran east off of the Way of the Dragon , ending in a deadend in the block of buildings that stood between Way of the Dragon and the High Road . In the center of the alleyway, it was the northern terminus of Burdag Lane .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Blackhorn Alley was named for a cobbler that once lived on it, Alsible Blackhorn . Long after his death, by 1360's DR , it became a frequent haunt of brown giant rats . Some of the more destitute Waterdhavians were known to go after these rats with clubs or the alley's empty crates, viewing them as an easy meal.</p>
