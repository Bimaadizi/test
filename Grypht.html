<p>Grypht was a saurial mage from the same tribe as Dragonbait . He was larger than other saurials and resembled an anthropomorphic triceratops .</p>
<p>After most of his tribe were possessed by Moander , he traveled from his own dimension to Toril , using a transference spell to take the place of Elminster . This placed him at the center of Finder 's trial. He was attacked by Kyre , who was also possessed by Moander, and trapped in a soul gem . When Kyre tried and failed to capture Akabar , the latter freed Grypht from the soul gem, believing it might house Elminster. Akabar was knocked unconscious during the fight. Grypht fled with Akabar for his own protection.</p>
<p>However, Breck Orcsbane was convinced that Grypht was a monster who'd murdered Kyre. A party including Breck and Dragonbait tracked down Grypht and he was nearly killed before Breck accepted that he was not a demon .</p>
<p>Grypht then played an important subsidiary role in the battle against Moander, using magic to create walls of spells and free other saurials from possession.</p>
<p>After Moander's death, Grypht remained with his tribe in the Lost Vale .</p>
