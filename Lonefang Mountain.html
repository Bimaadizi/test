<p>Lonefang Mountain , or simply Lonefang , was an exceptionally frigid mountain and, by far, the northernmost named peak in northwest Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This peak was shaped much like the pointed front part of a boat. It was reported that it could be seen by gazing out at the horizon from the north-facing mountains of the Spine of the World . Its only known entrance was an extensive shaft that penetrated a northern slope from above, and ended in a cave that was filled with the ice of a frozen lake.</p>
<p>Lonefang Mountain had several subcaverns, such as a bonepit, a central cavern that held several magical items, and a cavern filled with chunks of metal ores. There was also a long, trap-filled tunnel that was overlooked by a large ledge, which led to further storage caverns. Each storage cavern opened into the next via a frozen waterfall containing gems . Not all of the interior of Lonefang was a series of caverns, though. One tall and wide vertical shaft existed, in order to allow a dragon to quickly ascend or descend via flight.</p>
<p>Inside this peak was also an iron prison that its owner used to confine small creatures and humans . The prison itself was cylindrical with many chambers.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Lonefang was so far up north that it was isolated from almost all sites of interest, except from the Dragonholes . This frozen mountain was 250 miles (400 kilometers) north of the eastern part of the Spine of the World.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The frozen lake of the entrance itself served as a point of defense. Arauthator , who dwelt here, was known to cast spells at intruders who wished to make it further into the cavernous network.</p>
<p>There were no known guards in this lair.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 14 th and 15 th centuries DR , Lonefang was the main home of the chaotic evil white dragon , Arauthator.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Though it only had one visible entrance, this lair was thought to also have an underground back entrance near the Worldwyrm's Teeth . This back entrance was said to exist several miles to the north and west of the lair and could be accessed via glacial rifts.</p>
<p>According to a victim who escaped Lonefang Mountain, the prison within looked incredibly similar to a gnomish craft that was used to travel to other crystal spheres .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Arauthator, the Old White Death, made his main lair here. He was known to gleefully laugh as he made his way to the lower-most storage cavern. Once arrived, he would roll around in the bed of gems and purr, much like an excited cat .</p>
