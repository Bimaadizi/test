<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Struggling with severe insomnia, Kilnip found herself getting only a few hours of sleep each day. Despite constant fatigue, she remained an enthusiastic conversationalist.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of the Grinning Halfling, 1481 DR , Kilnip shared with three other kobolds a small monastic cell in the Dragon's Rest cloister cut into the cliff face. Each of the four slept on individual hammocks. Just like all the other kobolds, she worked at night because of their sunlight sensitivity.</p>
