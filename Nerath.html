<p>Nerath , also known to its inhabitants as " The First Work ", was a world that existed in a different continuum, parallel to that of Toril .</p>
<h2>Cosmography</h2>
<p>The world of Nerath was located in the same Prime Material plane where the world of Abeir-Toril, among others, existed, but was separated from it by a unthinkably long distance. While it was possible to reach Nerath by traveling beyond the known regions of the Astral Plane or the Elemental Chaos , such a travel would take many long years and it was easier just to find a portal that connected both worlds.</p>
<h3>Gateways</h3>
<p>There was at least one known portal to Nerath in Sigil .</p>
<p>Baba Yaga knew of Nerath and had probably even visited in her dancing hut , which traveled all the worlds and planes. In its Hall of Gateways, a portal called the World Gate linked to every world Baba Yaga knew of, as well as their respective Shadowfells and Feywilds .</p>
<h2>Notable locations</h2>
<p>The Nentir Vale was a small vale located in a northern region of this world, where the town of Fallcrest was located. The Silver Unicorn Inn , where Acquisitions Incorporated was founded, was one of Fallcrest's more popular inns.</p>
<h2>Notable individuals</h2>
<p>The deva Demascus and the plague demons Murmur and Scour were originally from this world.</p>
<p>Omin Dran , Jim Darkmagic and Binwin Bronzebottom were also from this world.</p>
<p>The wizards Mordenkainen and Emirikol had visited this world at least once.</p>
<h2>History in Relation to the Realms</h2>
<h3>Ancient History</h3>
<p>In ancient times, the dragonborn ruled a world-spanning empire named Arkhosia , that warred against Bael Turath , an empire ruled by tieflings . Eventually both empires destroyed each other in a devastating war. Even though both races had a long tradition of "enmity", those empires existed so long ago that the dragonborn of Tymanther in the late years of the 15 th century DR considered such enmity more theoretical than practical.</p>
<h3>Modern History</h3>
<p>Approximately 100 years before the fall of the empire of Nerath (the great empire of humankind on this world), worshipers of Tharizdun native to this world went to Sigil, and from there to Pandemonium , trying to free their god from its ancient prison. They ultimately failed, thanks to the efforts of heroes from the world of Nerath, among them the deva Demascus. However, the evil cultists managed to unleash the abyssal plague into many worlds of the multiverse, including Toril.</p>
<h2>Religion</h2>
<h3>Deities</h3>
<p>Some deities from this world were summoned by the gods of Realmspace during the Dawn War , to help them defend the newly born worlds of the Material Plane against the primordial threat.</p>
<p>The patron goddess of Demascus, Ioun , was originated from this world. The Raven Queen and Torog were also said to have originated from Nerath.</p>
<p>Of the gods of the Faer√ªnian pantheon , Bane was worshiped in Nerath as a god of conquest and war.</p>
