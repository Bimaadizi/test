<p>Ithal Road was a major trade road from Zazesspur to Saradush and Ithal Pass . It also passed through the center of Darromar , the capital of Tethyr , within which it was called Star Street . The stretch between Darromar and Zazesspur was called the Zazesspur Road . It was one of the only two major east–west routes in Tethyr, (the other being the Tethir Road .)</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The road from Zazesspur was well-kept and easy to travel on, but—at least during the Interregnum —it was preyed on by bandits.</p>
<p>In Darromar, the road divided the city north to south, while the River Ith , which was crossed at the Ithal Bridge , divided the city east to west. Two large markets, the Queen's Market and the Wheel Market were located west and east of the road, respectively.</p>
<p>In the east of Tethyr, the road split at the fortress of Barakmordin with separate forks leading to Saradush and Ithal Pass.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Ithal Road was completed during the time of the Shoon Imperium under the leadership of the vassal kings of Tethyr.</p>
