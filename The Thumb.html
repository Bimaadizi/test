<p>The Thumb was a tavern owner in Athkatla , Amn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The man owned the Sea's Bounty , a tavern and inn close to the city's docks. He spoke like a commoner, and often used slang. The Thumb enjoyed a drink or two; he sold mead and ale . He claimed he was never a pirate, but sailed the exotic merchant routes to the west.</p>
<p>The Thumb often referred to his hook, which was his namesake, as a "present" from his seafaring days. However, a woman named Gracie said that one should not believe what he says. In fact, she claimed he was only a fisherman who got his hand chopped of in a tavern brawl. She also said that he won the bar in a bet.</p>
<p>After he met the "wee beastie" mounted over his bed, he retired. Interestingly, a secret door in his tavern led to a pirate hideout. The captain proclaimed that he paid The Thumb good money for his secrecy.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He seemed friendly, offering travelers hospitality and bedding on cold and dreary days. However, if patrons got extremely drunk, he'd chuck them in a bed upstairs, for an extra charge.</p>
