<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some years prior to the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR , Dwarbilt Construction was approached by a merman named Slaythis J'harja . He desired to create an underwater restaurant in the Dragon Reach , having heard from a number of land dwellers during his adventuring days of the many restaurants and taverns that dotted the surface. The company's workers were fascinated by the prospect and contributed much to its plans, with discussions bringing up a number of engineering and technical issues. However, Dwarfbilt was ultimately unwilling to do work in or on the water.</p>
<p>Slaythis tried to make increasingly larger offers of gold and treasure for them to take his contract, but Dwarfbilt refused to budge. Eventually Slaythis yielded, thanking the company for their time and ideas. As they parted ways one of the employees took Slaythis aside and told him in hushed whispers of a fabled offshoot of the dwarven race, aquatic dwarves , but warned that they might be unwilling to work with him. This lead would eventually culminate in the desired restaurant, Sharkey's Bar & Grill .</p>
