<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lemminkainen's mother once used a magical iron rake, which could extend up to 200 yards (180 meters) in length, to fish his body from out of a deep body of water.</p>
<p>Some 1,500 years before, Lemminkainen killed Urho , the champion of Loviatar , and interred his remains within the Frozen Peaks on the world of the realms of Kalevala and Pohjola, and gave his terrible black-bladed greatsword Mordvin into the care of the dwarves of Girda, so that they might never be reunited. According to a dwarf bard of Girda, Lemminkainen arrived in the dead of winter, still bearing a hundred bleeding battle-wounds and gripping the sword's hilt tightly, no matter how its evil burned him because of his goodness, and thrust it all the way into a great block of ice he found in the courtyard there. Lemminkainen also built a shrine to house this block of ice, and this was guarded by the dwarves of Girda over the centuries to come.</p>
<h2>Home</h2>
