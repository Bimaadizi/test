<p>Pheszeltan was a great Hierophant Druid of Mielikki and later Silvanus who lived somewhere in the deep-most reaches of the Forgotten Forest in the North in the mid–14 th century DR . He was immortal and still living there by 1485 DR .</p>
<p>Living in the densest part of the forest, his domain was said to be more difficult to reach than the highest peaks of the Graypeak Mountains . He spoke only to those who were able enough to reach him, but to the few who did, he would offer advice.</p>
<p>By 1367 DR , Pheszeltan had been using the Hill of Lost Souls to wield powerful weather magic.</p>
