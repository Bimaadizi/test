<p>Banded mail was a type of heavy armor used on Toril .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This type of mail was covered in overlapping metal bands, which were sewn to a backing of chain mail and leather armor . The bands covered the most vulnerable areas, whilst the backing protected the joints and provided freedom of movement. Buckles and straps were added to balance the weight of the mail. A pair of gauntlets were attached to such mail.</p>
