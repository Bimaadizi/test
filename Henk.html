<p>Tender Henk was the proprietor and the barkeep of The Singing Lute in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tender Henk was a gruff and unfriendly half-orcish man with a shaggy mop of black hair. He offered sub-par service to the tavern's guests.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Tender Henk ran The Singing Lute, a tiny waterside tavern that overlooked the Counting House and the city's Gray Harbor . Honk , a fellow half-orc who had a similar appearance and attitude to Henk's, was known to tend to The Singing Lute when Henk was indisposed. Their similarities implied a blood relation. Honk insisted that Henk played his lute in the kitchen during the off hours.</p>
<p>During the same period of time, Henk posted an ad, searching to hire a drummer for the Lute's pickup band.</p>
