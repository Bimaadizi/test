<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Cape of Wyrms was located at the long outcropping at the northern end of the Akanapeaks , north of the city-state of Reth and northwest across the mountains from Airspur . Paddle Straits was a narrow marine passage between the isle of Wavecrest and the Cape of Wyrms.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before the 14 th century DR , the peninsula was just known as the Tail, until the early 1300s DR. During that time, many sea caves of the Tail hid clutches of black dragon eggs , that, eventually hatched and black dragon youths exploded into a conflict. The wyrms' fighting extended into the surrounding territories, and locals started calling the promontory the Cape of Wyrms.</p>
