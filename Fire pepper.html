<h2>Description</h2>

When a single fire pepper was mixed with up to 1 gallon (3,800 cubic centimeters) of liquid, anyone taking a small sip of the liquid was incapacitated for several minutes as they were wracked with burning pain. Taking a larger drink of the tainted liquid resulted in an even longer period of incapacitation in addition to physical harm.</p>
<p>Anyone taking a bite of, or eating a fire pepper would instantly die if they were unable to resist the deadly magic. Even if they were able to resist, the victim would still fall to floor and experience the same debilitating pain one would feel from drinking liquid contaminated with a fire pepper .</p>
