<p>Around the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the self-proclaimed "Lord of the Vale", Wolmad Eaglewing , led a group of Sky Ponies and formed a camp in the Nether Mountains . They acted as little more than bandits, demanding payment from those passing through the Sundabar Vale and Old Delzoun , all while the tribe's chieftain was dying in a camp nearby.</p>
<p>The barbarians of the Sky Pony tribes harassed and raided the orcs that poured out of the mountains during the War of the Silver Marches . During this conflict their chieftain at the time, Arnzan Vashk, was badly wounded, an orcish spearhead stuck in his chest.</p>
