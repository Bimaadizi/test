The trio encountered the halfling thief who was on the quest to retrieve Laeral Silverhand 's baby griffin from Xanathar's Thieves' Guild . They fished the halfling out of Sargauth waters and took him to the Blind Fish to dry off. The thief unwisely asked questions about the Xanathar which prompted the shady friends to attack the thief. Xanathar offered bounty for anyone who showed curiosity in the crime lord. The little halfling managed to escape the trio with the aid of his wit and dexterity... and the orc bartender's heavy club .</p>
