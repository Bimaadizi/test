<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Zehla helped a friendly acquaintance of hers, a guardsman by the name of Kelemvor Lyonsbane , by providing care for his suddenly-ill employer, Caitlan Moonsong . She provided aide to the teenage girl, along with a bed to rest for the night. As Caitlan recovered the following morning, Zehla took her side during a disagreement with Kelemvor and convinced the grizzled mercenary to take on the magic-user Midnight along on their journey beyond Arabel.</p>
<p>Later, Myrmeen Lhal thoroughly questioned Zehla about her connection to Kelemvor Lyonsbane, and surprisingly the two women became friends. The Lady Lord was known to visit the Hungry Man Inn without her bodyguards.</p>
