<p>Ilsa Wisemantle was a noble from Neverwinter who had an interest in the safety of Phandalin as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Ilsa was brave and kind. She sought to help those who needed it, even evil creatures, and would throw herself in harm's way to protect others despite the fact that was not a warrior.</p>
<p>She had some knowledge about medical care.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>While investigating goings-on around Phandalin, Ilsa took up residence in a sparsely furnished cave at the base of the Sword Mountains which had once been home to a group of yuan-ti who had been driven out by an unknown entity and subsequently captured some of the people of Phandalin to transform into fellow monsters.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Ilsa was a friend of Sildar Hallwinter , and became a trusted ally of the Town Council of Phandalin .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following Volothamp Geddarm 's publication of Volo's Guide to Monsters , in which he highlighted the town of Phandalin, Ilsa began to take an interest in the town. She arrived in the town shortly after to investigate a spate of troubles plaguing the town, including monster attacks, strange magics , and virulent madness. Unknown to her, many of these were caused by the machinations of the beholder Gavmogon .</p>
<p>She first took up residence in a cave that had been used by yuan-ti who had briefly terrorized the region. There, she soon befriended a sick mind flayer named Cerali , who was driven from its colony aboard a downed nautiloid in the Sword Mountains after its elder brain was driven mad. She nursed the mind flayer back to health until Sildar Hallwinter was able to send a group of adventurers to help remove the threat to the region posed by the elder brain. She then returned to Phandalin to continue her investigations.</p>
<p>She subsequently heard rumors of an explorer named Aladair , who was likewise investigating the threats to Phandalin. She learned that Aladair believed that the chaos and madness in the region was being caused by a beholder (Gavmogon) lairing beneath a temple near Wave Echo Cave , and subsequently came to agree with this assessment after Aladair disappeared into said lair. She took her information to the Town Council of Phandalin, and helped a group of adventurers find the lair.</p>
