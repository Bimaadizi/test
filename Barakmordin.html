<p>Barakmordin , or the Shielding Mountains , was an abbey in Tethyr dedicated to the Triad : Torm , Ilmater , and Tyr .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It was located at an intersection of the Ithal Road , right where it split to lead either to Ithal Pass or Saradush .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The abbey had three corner towers, each one with a temple dedicated to one of its three deities. The other buildings of the abbey, including the central keep, were devoted to the collective worship of the Triad.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Barakmordin was founded in the Year of Ten Atonements, 839 DR , during the reign of King Samyte of Tethyr. The original incarnation of the abbey was a shrine for Torm, with partial fortifications and a garrison. The abbey was partially destroyed in the Year of the Ogre, 909 DR by a goblin horde from the Omlarandin Mountains . When the abbey was reconstructed, the three distinctive corner towers were added. A shrine to Ilmater was added in the Year of the Spawning, 1070 DR , as thanks for the Tormish abbey's loyalty to the Lions' Dynasty during a period of political turmoil. Further donations were made by King Alemander I , who funded the construction of outer walls and a large, central keep. A group of Tyrran paladins aided the abbey during a monster attack, proving their order's worth. In the Year of the Lean Purse, 1198 DR , the abbey became dedicated to the Triad as a whole.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Knights Kuldar of Barakmordin , an organization of holy warriors devoted to the Triad, were based out of Barakmordin.</p>
