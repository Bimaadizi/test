<p>The Fiery Flagon was a stately old tavern in Waterdeep in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR that served excellent food.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The tavern was located in the city's Sea Ward , on the west side of Seawatch Street , across from the House of Inspired Hands at the intersection with Shark Street .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>This building stood only a single story tall. Its entryway was a wide, iron -barred door.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>As soon as one entered the Fiery Flagon, they were confronted with a descending staircase that lead down into the tavern proper. The cellar level larger was larger than the space taken up by the building above-ground, though it was still somewhat small and cramped, its space being taken up by a large amount of seafaring decor and flotsam. This included such things as anchors , blown-glass floats, figureheads worn by time out at sea, and a skeleton of an eye of the deep that had lamps set in its eyesockets, projecting an eerie and flickering glow over the room. The floor was also taken up by numerous tanks of fish, that contributed to a damp feeling. The staff would extract the seafood to be served from these tanks.</p>
<p>Notably, hidden within the confines of the building was a secret access tunnel, that winded downward in long staircase, until eventually terminating at a ladder shaft down into caverns near the lawless city of Skullport . The entrance was guarded by a heavily barred door, warded to reflect back spells like a ring of spell turning . It also produced the sound of a gong whenever this defensive effect was triggered.</p>
<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
<p>This tavern was popular amongst sailors from across the Sword Coast and wider corners of the Realms, often eager to swap tales, due in part to its choice in decor. Whilst it was not as refined an establishment as some taverns, like The Ship's Wheel , it made up for it being a far safer dive than sailor frequented bars over in the Dock Ward .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The menu of the Fiery Flagon was primarily seafood, which the cooks would prepare and cook in front of the patrons. Additionally, they welcomed preparing any seafood that a patron brought in. Beyond seafood, the provender included bread , cheese , and grapes .</p>
<p>Despite its somewhat ramshackle appearance and having no drinking vessels fancier than tankards , the Fiery Flagon charged just enough for its provender that most scabs and scoundrels stayed away. A plate of a simple meal cost 7 silver pieces . In terms of beverages, they charged 3 copper pieces for a rough ale and 5 for a good ale, 1 sp for a tankard of zzar , and charged gold pieces for wines and other spirits. One of their most expensive offerings was firebelly whiskey , which cost 14 gp.</p>
<p>According to those in the know, the proprietor would allow access to the secret tunnel to Skullport in return for 5 silver pieces. Whenever this transaction was made, he would have a half-dozen armed men watch over the door as he used some manner of wand upon it. This service was of frequent use to smugglers .</p>
<p>Additionally, it was rumored that the proprietor would outfit pirates with food and gear, as well as even act as a fence for them. When Volothamp Geddarm visited and wrote about the Fiery Flagon for Volo's Guide to Waterdeep , he received confirmation from his colleague Elminster that these rumors were true.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In the 14 th century DR, the Fiery Flagon had four cooks whom were all old, grizzled seamen. They were quite skilled in their craft, preparing food with such swiftness and finesse. Many of its patrons trusted in these cooks knowing what was best when it came to making sea life delectable. The tavern's owner at that time, Ulscaleer Anbersyr , was likewise an old retired sea captain.</p>
<p>The sea life that took up residence in the tavern's tanks commonly included blackjaws , moon-faced clearfins , dangerous kgrench , and sea snakes .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Beyond the solidly verified rumors of Ulscaleer's unscrupulous business with pirates, there were tales of a wraith called the Sea Ghost connected to the Fiery Flagon. According to legends, the dripping specter would pursue anyone who dared to interfere the affairs of pirates. Most regulars were convinced that this was no more than a tall tale told to scare off the nosy, though Elminster was not quite certain that the story was merely talk.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This tavern was of quite some age, being one of the few remnants of the Sea Ward's Mud Flats having once been home to a large population of sailors, back before many affluent Waterdhavians had decided to move out north from Castle Waterdeep .</p>
<p>The Fiery Flagon often enjoyed high traffic during Fleetswake , even though that festival's activity primarily occurred in the city's Dock Ward.</p>
<p>Around the mid-1360's DR, the famed traveling writer Volothamp Geddarm visited the Fiery Flagon and wrote about it in his travelogue Volo's Guide to Waterdeep .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , on the 10 th of Uktar , Auril's Blesstide festivities were interrupted by the discovery of three ice sculptures of nude men on the Seas' Edge Beach . Whether they were actually mere ice sculptures or the bodies of three participants in the day's parade, who swam and turned to ice by some magic, was not immediately known to authorities. No one could definitively identify the men, but some claimed that the sculptures bore the likenesses of three unknown braggarts in the Fiery Flagon from the previous night. Magical attempts either to speak with the dead or to restore the ice to flesh failed.</p>
