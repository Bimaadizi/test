<p>A ring of regeneration was a magic ring that gradually and continuously healed the wounds of its wearer.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Every ten minutes, the ring of regeneration emitted a burst of recuperative magic, restoring part of the health of its attuned wearer. It was also capable of regenerating lost limbs, in a process that took a few days.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>The Imaskarran arcane knowledge book, the Tome of the Ring had a crafting recipe for a ring of regeneration . The recipe called for fenberries , an eye of a rakshasa , and the spell of Melf's acid arrow .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Various rings of regeneration have been in existence since the glory days of the Imaskarran Empire. But one of the more modern versions was created by a lowly Red Wizard Huhhus who was not particularly talented in the art . He discovered a method of distilling troll flesh into a potion of regeneration , the liquid so foul, almost no-one was willing to ingest it. He considered that endeavor a failure. A few decades later, one of Huhhus' students used the master's research to craft a magic ring that incorporated troll's ichor and brain. As no-one needed to ingest gross troll-liquid, this ring of regeneration recipe was a success.</p>
<p>In late 14 th century DR, the rings of regeneration could often be purchased from vendors and good-aligned temples across the cities of the Sword Coast , including Neverwinter and Daggerford .</p>
