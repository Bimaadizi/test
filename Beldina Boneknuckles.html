<p>Beldina Boneknuckles was a poor commoner who inhabited the Lower City of Baldur's Gate , in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Beldina Boneknuckles's neighbors were killed in a burglary-turned-murder. The lovely couple left behind an orphan girl with not a single coin to pay for her parents' funeral and last rites. The bodies were left in the family's apartment in the Lower City and began to smell by the time Beldina decided to collect a few coppers from the neighbors and plead with a Kelemvorite to perform the appropriate ceremonies of the dead before the bodies would end up being tossed into the River Chionthar . Beldina's plea was aimed at Mortarch Gracie Scyre , who oversaw the Lower City Graveyard .</p>
