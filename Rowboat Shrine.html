<p>The Rowboat Shrine was a shrine found in Miyama Province in Kozakura during the midâ€“14 th century.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Situated along the shores of Nora-ko , this shrine was a modest stone memorial erected by the villagers of Ibara . It commemorated the site of the clandestine meetings between two lovers whose story was woven into the fabric of local lore.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to legend, on a night fraught with a fearsome storm, the man vanished while trying to reunite with his beloved. The shattered remnants of his boat later drifted ashore at the very spot where she awaited his arrival. Overwhelmed by grief, she eventually succumbed to her sorrow and passed away.</p>
<p>In the wake of this tragedy, it was rumored that the spirits of the lovers continued to linger, forever parted by the waters of Nora-ko. He was often envisioned rowing his boat, while she was pictured standing on the shore, each unable to reach the other. The local sandpipers were said to possess a distinctive call that eerily resembled the mournful utterance of his name.</p>
