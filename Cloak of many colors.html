<p>A cloak of many colors was a rare enchanted item that provided immunities to the wearer by shifting its color pigments.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Though the cloak always looked the same to the wearer, others would see a constantly changing surface of swirling patterns.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The color-shifting of this item protected the wearer against the effects of a prismatic wall , prismatic sphere , and color spray , and even allowed the wearer to pass through the prismatic barriers unhindered. The cloak also protected the wearer from blindness caused by spells such as blur , pyrotechnics , hypnotic pattern , and darkness , as well as all other forms of blinding light.</p>
<p>The cloak's swirling surface made it slightly easier for the wearer to blend in with shadows. The cloak could glow similar to a light spell for nine minutes at a time once every two hours.</p>
