<p>Talieth was the Lady of Sentinelspire, the daughter of Alaodin .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Talieth had flawless, smooth, dark skin, black eyes, and black hair she kept in braids to her waist.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to 1365 DR , Talieth had a romance with Kheil , her father's best assassin. She wept for the man's death during his raid on the Yuirwood on Mirtul 2 of that year. In the years since, she participated in two revolts against her father, both of which were quashed; she personally led the second revolt in 1369 DR , which left her imprisoned in the dungeons of the fortress. When the druid Chereth slew Alaodin and freed her, she swore loyalty to him; the druid then became the second Old Man of the Mountain. At some point after Kheil's death, she also took the assassin Valmir as her lover and began to teach him magic.</p>
<p>She learned that Kheil was alive again by scrying in 1374 DR , after learning that the new Old Man of the Mountain sought an artifact of Silvanus , Erael'len , which the former assassin held. She sent Sauk and a number of others to the Shalhoond to fetch the killer and the artifact. Instead, they retrieved the artifact and Berun's apprentice, Lewan . Though she was informed by Sauk that Kheil was no longer himself, and also that he was swallowed by the earth, she remained skeptical that he may be dead yet, believing this to be a machination of Chereth's. Once Lewan was awake, she told him that the Old Man meant to trigger a supervolcanic eruption using the relic, and that she wanted him to invert its functions in order to prevent the relic from ever accomplishing this function.</p>
<p>On the night of Tarsakh 19 , she took an opportunity to send assassins after the Old Man's men during a vigil that he had called. On Tarsakh 20 , Lewan accepted after Ulaan , one of her personal blades, seduced him the night before. However, after five days of attempts, he'd suggest that perhaps he needed to purify himself before the Oak Father in order to continue, given he'd spent the night of the Jalesh Rudra laying with Ulaan. She agreed to yield Ulaan's freedom if he succeeded, but stipulated someone would have to accompany him outside: Sauk. Upon his return, Sauk immediately informed her that the Old Man of the Mountain had spoken to Lewan during his purification ritual.</p>
<p>That night on Tarsakh 25 , Kheil, now Berun, attacked the fortress and forced his way inside. Talieth slew several blades loyal to her father, but she was unwilling to harm Berun or let any harm come to him, even standing up to Sauk after Berun's animal companion slew Taaki . She was captured soon after by the forces of the Old Man, being released by her lover, Valmir. During the final battle against the Old Man of the Mountain, her life was threatened to make Berun more pliable. She was eventually amongst the few people who survived Tarsakh 25 in Sentinelspire.</p>
