<p>Ice para-elementals , sometimes referred to as cold or frost para-elementals , were a variety of para-elementals composed of elemental ice.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These elementals had hulking, humanoid forms composed entirely out of ice, having a translucent white quality and being covered in patches of frost, sometimes covered in sharpened icicles. The glint of light off their roughly hewn forms sometimes gave off the impression of eyes. On average these forms stood around 8​ to ​16 feet (2.4​ to ​4.9 meters) tall, though one could also find individuals that were smaller or larger, with the true scope of potential height ranges being 4​ to ​40 feet (1.2​ to ​12 meters) tall.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Like most of their para-elemental kin, their intellects ranged from low to high and they typically had a neutral disposition.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Ice para-elementals were impervious to harm from cold-based spells and magics , but vulnerable to those based around heat. They could only be struck by weapons with a +1 or greater enchantment .</p>
<p>These elementals exuded an aura of intense cold around them. Their touch was so frigid that it could freeze a body of water, or any other liquid that was primarily composed of water, up to a distance of 100 square feet (9.3 square meters) and a depth of 6 inches (0.15 meters). And they could freeze metal around them, in a manner similar to the spell chill metal . If they ever found themselves injured in any way, they could heal themselves if in contact with natural cold material such as ice, snow, or sleet.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Ice para-elementals were typically patient combatants, waiting for their enemies to approach them first, with the more larger among them pretending to be rather slow or delayed in movement so they could better lure their opponents closer.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Most visitors to the home plane of these para-elementals typically encountered them in small, leaderless loose bands, hunting for warmth or patrolling the area for any intruders. Rulers in their society obtained their positions through show of strength and respect. Whilst it was not uncommon for leaders to be challenged by those under them, in general ice para-elemental society was largely without disorder.</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Ice-paralementals gained sustenance by the act of draining warmth, converting it into energy. This warmth could be extracted from any nearby source of heat. This draining of heat also mitigated the threat that heat had upon them. However, they did not actually require sustenance to survive.</p>
<h3>Homelands</h3>
<p>These elementals were indigenous to the Para-Elemental Plane of Ice , but could on rare ocassions be found on the neighboring Plane of Air Plane of Water . Most lived together in isolative kingdoms, ruled over by numerous minor ice para-elemental lords and nobles, referred to by some as "ice-lords".</p>
<p>In the Outer Planes , ice para-elementals could be found in the Iron Wastes , the domain of Kostchtchie in the Abyss . In the World Tree cosmology , they could be found in the divine realm of Winter's Hall .</p>
<p>On the Prime Material plane , they were often encountered on the River Ith in Tethyr , living alongside many other water-based monsters.</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>Those that were intelligent enough spoke their own para-elemental language, as well as Aquan and Auran .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Whilst a good deal of ice para-elementals served in the grand army of Cryonax , most of them ignored his evil biddings and preferred to remain neutral and devoted purely to coldness. Beyond Cryonax, these para-elementals were known to act as servants of the frost goddess Auril .</p>
<h3>Summoning</h3>
<p>High ranking Icepriestesses , specialty priests in the Church of Auril , were capable of conjuring ice para-elementals once per tenday , in a manner similar to the spell conjure fire elemental . The more powerful among them were capable of summoning them more than once. A magical tome of their faith, the Codicil of White , also featured a ritual for summoning them.</p>
<h3>Usages</h3>
<p>Enchanted projectiles known as ice bullets could be carved from their bodies.</p>
