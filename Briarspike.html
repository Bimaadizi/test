<p>Briarspikes were enchanted spears forged by Menold of Waterdeep sometime before 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These spears appeared as if they were quills pulled out of the hide of some unknown giant beast. However, Briarspikes were man-made weapons. Each polearm bore the markings of Menold, their creator.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Each Briarspike possessed a +2 enchantment that made the weapon deadlier and strike more true than any similar mundane weapon. Additionally, these spears released bursts of corrosive acid upon each successful hit.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>There existed many Briarspikes , all forged by Menold of Waterdeep. The true number of the weapons remained unknown as the smith was presumed dead as of several years before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , when his tower fell under an orcish onslaught. The number of Briarspikes appearing in the wild suggested that he might've attempted to haggle for his life when captured by the attackers, who received a supply of these spears from their "guest."</p>
<p>One of the Briarspikes could be found in the weapon vendor stalls of the Market Triangle in Westgate circa the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR .</p>
