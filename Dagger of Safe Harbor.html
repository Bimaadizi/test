<p>The Dagger of Safe Harbor was a unique and famous enchanted dagger created by Gullwyn , a seafaring merchant, centuries before the 13 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Dagger of Safe Harbor possessed a potent +3 enchantment that increased its damage and guided the wielder's hand toward the target. The dagger allowed its owner to cast Otiluke's resilient sphere once per day, shielding them from any and all harm.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In his long merchant and sailor career, Gullwyn witnessed countless men being swept off the ships during deadly storms, all because of a split second of fear. To protect himself while showing respect to the mighty power of the seas, Gullwyn created the Dagger of Safe Harbor that could shield its owner from all effects of the world for a short period of time. In the years that followed the weapon's creation, the Dagger of Safe Harbor saved Gullwyn's life on at least three occasions. At the end of his career, Gullwyn entrusted the famed dagger to his friend – Valkur of Mintarn .</p>
<p>By some unknown means, the Dagger of Safe Harbor ended up in the magic item collection of the wizard Kieran Nye in the far frontier town of Lonelywood in the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR .</p>
