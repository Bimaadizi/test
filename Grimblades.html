<p>The Grimblades were an adventuring company that operated around the Inner Sea lands in the late 13th century DR . The Grimblades were led by Kesten "Steelglance" Orthalin .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Grimblades were thought to have plundered a number of ruins in the lands around the eastern Inner Sea.</p>
<p>In the late 13th century DR, their leader Kesten came into the possession of a magical short sword and had the sage Arthylmas of Saerloon identify the blade. It was Sarghathuld , a legendary relic of Roldilar and Impiltur , and lost since the Year of the Luminar Procession, 1127 DR , a century and a half before.</p>
<p>However, barely three seasons later, the Grimblades were all slain by the green dragon Urnalithorgathla in her lair in the Spiderhaunt Wood in the Dalelands . Their bones and Sarghathuld laid among her treasure hoard for over ninety years.</p>
