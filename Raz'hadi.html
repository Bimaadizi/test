<p>The Raz'hadi were a tribe of the Bedine people that lived in the great desert of Anauroch .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Like all of the Bedine tribes, the Raz'hadi were led by a single elder man holding the title of sheikh. As of the early 1360s DR , the head of the Raz'hadi was Sheikh Utaiba .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>They preferred the oasis known as the Well of the Chasm , in the Scimitar Spires mountains. They were one of only a few tribes that knew of its exact location.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , malevolent agents of the Zhentarim embarked upon a campaign against the Bedine people in order to gain control of a stretch of the Anauroch desert. As the army marched across the sands, they set up camp just outside the Well of the Chasm and besieged the Raz'hadi people within their cavern oasis. The siege was broken by the warriors of the Bait Mahwa tribe, who joined the Raz'hadi to defeat the Zhents and their asabi mercenaries at the Battle of the Chasm shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Sheikh Utaiba, the Raz'hadi went on to join the unified tribes of the Bedine at the oasis of Elah'zad fight in the decisive Battle of the Fissures , and ultimately defeat the Zhentilar at Orofin , halting the army's campaign against their people.</p>
