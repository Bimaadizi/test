<p>Droona Shveitz was an inhabitant of Baldur's Gate and the wife of Agnes Shveitz in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Droona was a female gold dwarf with a clean-shaven face and long, straight chestnut hair gathered in a ponytail. The woman had a fair skin tone, dark brown eyes, and a beauty mark at the corner of her left eye.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Agnes Shveitz, Droona's wife, was murdered, presumably by the vicious members of the Cult of Bhaal , in or shortly before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . Agnes was buried in the Lower City Graveyard , next to the Hhune Mausoleum . The gravestone was etched with a single inscription: "Beloved Agnes Shveitz. Her smile shined like a thousand suns." In 1492 DR, Droona could often be seen mourning at the gravestone. The murder made her a stern supporter of the new Grand Duke Lord Enver Gortash , hoping that he would bring the murderers to justice and believing that if it were not for his steel watch , there would be many more Bhaalist murders in Baldur's Gate. Droona was at her wife's grave when it may had been accidentally desecrated, and Agnes's body raised as a zombie by Nina Dortmell , a talented child with the gift , who was trying to resurrect her recently deceased brother.</p>
