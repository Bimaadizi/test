<p>Belaur Aumar was the nominal king of Athalantar , but in truth he was under the power of the magelords . Finally, he was killed by his nephew, Elminster Aumar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Belaur was the oldest son of the Stag King of Athalantar, Uthgrael Aumar . At his father's death in 216 DR , he proclaimed himself king; however, most of his brothers opposed him, starting a civil war.</p>
<p>Belaur in the end defeated his brothers with the decisive help of a group of wizards recruited by him, the magelords. However, the magelords proved themselves more powerful than Belaur and soon assumed control of the kingdom.</p>
<p>Thus Belaur ruled in name only, but people considered him responsible for the situation. In 240 DR , his nephew, Elminster Aumar , started an insurrection against the magelords. Elminster killed Belaur.</p>
