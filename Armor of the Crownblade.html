<p>The armor of the Crownblade , also known as the Crownblade's reflection , was a kind of clothing and armor found in Myth Drannor during the late 14 th century DR , magically derived from the legendary Crownblade .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These reflections took the form of various pieces of elven armor and clothing with a consistent gold and brown appearance, including light , medium , and heavy armor , cloaks , robes , helmets , whole outfits, and docent -like trinkets.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These items were exceptionally protective and aided the wearer's healing abilities. The cloaks made the wearer seem more threatening and impressive, while helms simply gave more protection.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These disparate pieces of gear were created when the echo of the Crownblade defiantly broke from the Crownblade proper, creating an array of linked magical items from pure magic. These remained in Myth Drannor, waiting to be found by those like Tannivh Dahast 's Cormanthor Elves and the Red Wizards of Droic Orgul . The Red Wizards further strengthened these items, but their connection to the Crownblade let them withstand the corruptive evil of their rituals.</p>
