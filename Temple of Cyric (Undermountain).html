<p>The Temple of Cyric on the Dungeon Level of Undermountain was a strange underground structure that radiated evil and served as a deadly and cruel entertainment for the living and undead Cyricists .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple could be considered a hidden shrine. To access it, reckless adventurers had to navigate long tunnels of the Dungeon Level of Undermountain, located not far from a stronghold used by the Shadow Thieves in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR . The temple's entrance was aptly indicated with the holy symbol of Cyric – a skull on the red star background. The evil surrounding the shrine entrance was so potent that it was palpable, leaving visitors feeling uneasy and sending their skin crawling.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Beyond the temple's door laid a long corridor that ended in a portcullis gate which opened into the temple's main hall. The hall was more of a deadly mad trap rather than a place of worship. A giant grinning skull decorated the war on the opposite side of the entrance. Its open maw spewed lava on the bottom of the hall. The entrance was perched atop the lava lake with perilously narrow walkways starting on the left and right sides, hugging the walls and leading around the room towards the temples of the giant skull.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of 1370 DR , the temple was home to several strong undead skeleton and ghoul worshipers of Cyric. The creature in charge was a strong, intelligent skeletal priest whose voice echoed across the temple, greeting adventurers. The sinister voice warned visitors that the price of entry was death. If visitors survived the hallway and reached the giant skull chamber, the sinister voice taunted them and offered a reward to persistent visitors. Many would-be heroes plummeted into lava as the skeleton priest watched them with mad glee. Those who survived the walkways and undead guardians and reached the chambers beyond the giant skull received their promised reward – death.</p>
