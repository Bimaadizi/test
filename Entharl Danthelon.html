<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the early 1480s DR , Entharl rented out parts of his residence to others, such as the wizard , Yssra Brackrel . Though Entharl claimed an animated "dancing" axe was gifted to him by an elf princess during his time as an adventurer, it was actually Brackrel's illusion that cloaked a stirge .</p>
<p>In 1492 DR , he was preoccupied with reports of smugglers that went missing in the Riverveins tunnels. He encouraged his shoppers to seek out the smugglers, who were said to have been carrying a potion -filled chest. During the same period of time, Entharl Danthelon was secretly affiliated with the Harpers , grating them the use of the shop's cellar. Entharl and his hired bodyguards ensured the safehouse remained unmolested by the city guard and the steel watchers . Due to that affiliation, the dwarf was familiar with the High Harper of Baldur's Gate – Jaheira , whom he called "oaken maiden." At one point, a group of doppelgangers impersonated Harper agents in attempts to ambush Jaheira within the safehouse.</p>
<p>When the city of Baldur's Gate started mandating donations to fight with the Absolute crisis , Entharl Danthelon donated three sets of worn travel cookware and utensils on at least one occasion.</p>
