<p>Kadroth was a cultist of Levistus who oversaw the Knights of the Black Sword in the tiny town of Caer-Dineval during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kadroth was seen as an inspired and ingenious leader by his followers. He had a sly mind for politics and cultivated a true cult of personality.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He led the cult from the reclaimed office of Caer-Dineval's former speaker, at the town's castle .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>While Kadroth received telepathic messages from Levistus, he was not able to communicate to the archdevil in kind. He lied about the latter fact to his followers, and in fact Levistus truly hated the tiefling cult leader.</p>
<p>He and Hethyl Arkorran had a mutual disdain for one another, and a standoffish relationship with Avarice of the Arcane Brotherhood .</p>
<p>In addition to his cultist followers, Kadroth "employed" a number of captured servants, including the young tiefling Mere and a human called Thoob .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , Kadroth led the cult in a campaign to take over the power of Caer-Dineval's speaker, Crannoc Siever . They took up residence within the castle, and prevented the speaker from leaving his personal quarters. He took advantage of the man's ill health and acted as leader in his place, using Speaker Siever to sign and necessary documents and turning away anyone who sought to visit him in person.</p>
