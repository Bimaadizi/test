<p>The Rosznar family ( pronounced : /ˈ r oʊ z z n ɑːr / ROZZ-nar , or : /ˈ r ɔː dʒ n ɑːr / RAWJ-nar ) was a rather infamous noble house of Waterdeep and Amn .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Rosznars were wealthy landowners, known in part for their vineyards in the countryside of Amn. In addition to a fine ruby wine , they also produced a variety of poisons .</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>The Rosznars were not above tossing a political rival, enemy, or other "problem" into Lhestyn's Court and keeping them there until dead.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The family's noble estate was located in Waterdeep's Sea Ward on the north side of Thunderstaff Way between Shield Street and Copper Street .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Amnian Rosznars were ennobled in the 5 th century DR , in the Year of Forestsfrost, 479 DR .</p>
<p>Those members of the family from Waterdeep earned their nobility much later, in the Year of the Empty Goblet, 1252 DR .</p>
<p>The Amnian branch of the family had a long-standing feud with the steel dragon Jalanvaloss . During the Rage of Dragons , in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , the family uncovered many of the dragon's duplicitous secrets.</p>
<p>When Lady Estrip Rosznar of Waterdeep died around the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the City's Lords were obligated to acknowledge the familial assertions of her Amnian relatives.</p>
<p>In the 14 th century DR, the Waterdhavian Rosznars were banished from the city after being convicted of slavery. They returned to Waterdeep just over a century later.</p>
<p>However they were unable to regain the respect they'd lost in the scandal that got them banished in the first place. Many members were resentful of the loss, rationalizing that all families had skeletons in their closets and they were just unlucky that a family squabble had let their secret go public. They argued that the slave trade in Amn remained in good standing, as well as in other locations.</p>
