<p>Tordon Sureblade was younger half-brother of Thorm Sureblade and was the Lord Chancellor, later Lord Magistrate , of Ravens Bluff in the mid–14 th century DR . Before the Spellplague , he brought the law to benefit all citizens of the City of Ravens.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>At the age of 40 circa 1357 DR , Tordon Sureblade was short and muscular at 5 feet and 5 inches (1.7 meters) and 175 pounds (79.4 kilograms). He was meticulous about his appearance, always dressing neatly in conservative colors, especially grays and browns. As Lord Magistrate, he wore armor around his protective parts (kidney, groin, etc) due to the high chance of assassination in the city.</p>
<p>At age 57 circa 1405 DR , the severe Tordon spent most of his days in the black and brown robes of his office at the courts. When on town, he often donned his impressive plate mail armor .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Tordon was a man of few words, very solemn and dedicated to Torm and his duties as Lord Chancellor (later Lord Magistrate ) of the city's legal system. His main goal was to promote justice by creating a comprehensive system of laws. However, this required much paperwork and he worried that the demands of his job were making him stale as a fighter of evil. He rarely showed his feelings but occasionally revealed his dry wit. He tolerated non-evil faiths and tried to be as fair as possible in dealing with them. He gave 40% of his income to the temple to help the poor. He dearly loved his half-brother Thorm but despaired at his impulsive nature, which frequently led him into brawls.</p>
<p>By his approaching fifty-eight birthday, he still wore his armor in daily public to be ready for anything and to look handsome. He made charitable donations to the church of Torm and to the families of criminals he had sent to prison or the gallows. Ironically, the tough paladin began to despair his single status in his late 50s. While he remained deeply committed to his position, he had late attended several society functions in Uptown , even pretending to enjoy the festive party atmosphere and the "absurd" costumes often required of attendees. When not at court, he delighted in riding his griffon Zerasha , high over the City of Ravens. He also worried about his status as an unwed single who approached late-middle-age.</p>
<p>Tordon had a very dry, very funny sense of humor, though only his closest friends and companions had the chance to experience it private.Though deeply religious and dedicated to Torm, he respected all goodly religions, and had been known to go light on sentences of genuinely repentant religious criminals. He felt awkward in most social situations and hated aimless small talk. He tended to view his court appearances as chess matches, with insignificant-seeming "moves" coming into play later, trapping his adversary in a legal checkmate. He regretted his massive paperwork in court kept him away from the adventuring life.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Tordon was a standard paladin by 1357 DR who possessed the + 2 longsword Finder , + 1 shield , + 2 chainmail , a ring of feather falling , and a bag of holding (250 lb capacity). He was proficient in the lance , dagger , horseman's mace , bastard sword , horseman's military pick , and broadsword . He specialized in the longsword with a shield. By 1375 DR , the novice pinnacle paladin possessed a + 3 holy longsword , + 3 large silver shield , + 3 full plate armor , + 3 cloak of resistance , + 2 ring of protection , a phylactery of faithfulness , and a set of winged boots . He was a bona-fide chess master .</p>
<p>At 40, his physical abilities were above average with strength and charisma the highest. However, he was barely average in intelligence. By his late 50s, his physical abilities slightly declined, but his intelligence improved. Notably, his wisdom became equal to his charisma. In court, he had alertness, knowledge of the law, and unwavering focus. To observers, he was praised for his patience, his fearlessness in battle, and his ability to make fast, skillful judgements both in the courtroom and on the field of battle.</p>
<p>His was also proficient in diplomacy, concentration, animal handling, mounted combat, both religious and local knowledge, and the judge profession.</p>
<p>His special mount is a female griffon named Zerasha that possessed below average intelligence, but above average wisdom.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>His father was Wilhelm , whom he shared with Thorm, but his mother was a human named Eleanora . Tordon grew up in Ravens Bluff and saw firsthand the corruption and lawlessness that plagued the city before Charles Oliver O'Kane became the Lord Mayor. After learning to read, he spent many years in libraries educating himself about history, religion, politics, and legends, alternating with training to be a warrior. Eventually he dedicated his life to Torm during his studies and became a paladin. Circa the 1340s DR, he was appointed Lord Chancellor of Ravens Bluff but he still found time to help train young paladins and aid the temple however he could. As Lord Chancellor, he was automatically a member of the Council of Lords .</p>
<p>Tordon came to Ravens Bluff when he was five years old, having fled with his father and half-father from their home village Dead Tree Hollow . Their village was ravaged by a wandering band of minotaurs , but Thorm successfully retaliated against the minotaurs at the cost of his right eye. Noticing the city's corruption, Tordon did not join a street gang as did many of his playmates, but wanted to help the city through a career in the city government. Therefore, he studied in the musty libraries to have an education. As a Tormtar paladin, he ventured with his companions across Dragon Reach and then later adventured for a few years in Sembia , eventually returning to his city to fight corruption. After returning to Ravens Bluff, he worked as a barrister and became friends with Lauren De Villars .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Spur, 1348 DR , early the year Lord Chancellor Tordon persecuted a high-profile murder trial against the mad diviner Grim Zemladiken and his Organic Convergence ceremony.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , age 52 Tordon became stronger and was the Lord Magistrate of the city since the Year of the Bridle, 1349 DR . He codified volumes of law called "Tordon's Law".</p>
<p>By the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR approaching age 58, Tordon had brought much needed sense of credibility to the legal system of Ravens Bluff. He had also become a low level pinnacle paladin who could survive regional and continental threats.</p>
