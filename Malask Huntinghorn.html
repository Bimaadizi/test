<h2>History</h2>
<p>Malask Huntinghorn was in Alusair's retinue when she was dismissed by Elminster Aumar one night in early spring of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , when he took Royal Magician Caladnei to meet with Vangerdahast ; the old mage refused to take Alusair, thinking this a matter that did not call for her. She began to vent her frustrations on a sapling; he told her not to, foolishly, and she demanded he spar with her, attacking him savagely. She broke his nose; after that, their fighting eventually devolved into rutting.</p>
