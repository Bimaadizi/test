<p>Chariots were a type of two-wheeled, animal-drawn land vehicle. They were typically pulled by horses and they provided warriors better protection and maneuverability on battlefields.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Single chariots typically measured 5 feet (1.5 meters) by 5 feet (1.5 meters) and were 5 ft (1.5 m) tall, while double chariots were larger at 10 feet (3 meters) by 5 feet (1.5 meters).</p>
<p>Both sizes of chariot normally were capable of reaching speeds of up to 40 miles (64,000 meters) per hour, though ultimately the speed of a chariot was dependent upon the creatures pulling it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Throughout the history of Toril there had been many myths and legends that told of chariots flying in the sky. Some scholars believe that many of these stories were accounts of spelljammer sightings.</p>
<p>Prior to the development of chariots by mortals, the Mulhorandi gods Horus , Osiris , and Re all owned magical chariots. Though only Re's would survive the Orcgate Wars .</p>
<p>In the land of Zakhara , chariots dated back to the earliest days of civilization.</p>
<p>The development of the chariot proved to be crucial in the Calimshan Empire's battles against the beholders of the Alimir Mountains between -1280 to −1080 DR .</p>
<p>Some time between the First and Second Mulhorandi Empires, around -1048 to -105 DR , people in the land of Mulhorand discovered the wheel and soon after developed chariots.</p>
<p>In 729 DR , when the Scaled Horde overran the nation of Impiltur , a nalfeshnee named Drallith "the Poxed" drove a golden chariot pulled by chained chasme .</p>
<p>Following the introduction of the saddle and stirrup to Zakhara, the widespread use of chariots there gradually died out.</p>
<p>In 1359 DR , the army of Bloodstone fielded chariots against their enemies in the Bloodstone Wars .</p>
