<p>Queen Fritha Craegmar was the chieftain of the Reghedmen Tribe of the Tiger barbarians during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Renowned for her wisdom and fairness, Fritha was a formidable warrior , although she held no desire for violence and leaned towards sending diplomatic envoys.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As unexpected storms unleashed their fury in Eleasis of the Year of the Iron Dwarf's Vengeance, 1485 DR and the Tribe of the Tiger found itself assailed by beasts under the command of the Ice Witch , Queen Fritha Craegmar guided her people to seek haven in Bremen and not to fight the "weak folk" of the Ten Towns . She negotiated with Dorbulgruf Shalescar , the speaker of Bremen, but the townspeople, filled with suspicion, denied entry to the tribe. She organized a peaceful departure for the tribe and went to the northwestern shores of Maer Dualdon to set up a camp.</p>
<p>A significant number of the tribe's members voiced dissatisfaction with her leadership, asserting that she should have let them conquer the town to ensure the tribe's survival. She didn't retain her leadership for much longer. The details of what happened to her thereafter are unclear, but it is known that the next king was Korold .</p>
