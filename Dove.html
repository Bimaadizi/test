<p>Doves were a species of bird found in the Realms.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>In northwest Faer√ªn , doves were quite prevalent in the North Ward of Waterdeep , so much so that they were the ward's mascot.</p>
<h2>Significance</h2>
<p>White doves were favored animals of the deities Ilmater and Isis , while gray doves were favored by Mask and fiery red doves by Sune , with their presence being seen as an indication of the god's presence or approval or disapproval.</p>
<p>They were also commonly seen as familiars of con-tinh .</p>
<h2>Usages</h2>
<p>Doves were sometimes plucked, roasted, and eaten, with roasted dove served in the kitchens of Halarahh in Halruaa and at Swordsfall House in Silverymoon in the Silver Marches .</p>
<p>In certain auguries, the future was divined from the random flight patterns of wild birds such as doves. In the late 14 th century DR , Procopio Septus , the Lord Mayor of Halarahh and a diviner , devised a way to read the future in flights of doves magically lured to a dovecote in his kitchen for subsequent culinary use. This had two benefits as he enjoyed roasted dove.</p>
