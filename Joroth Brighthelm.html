<p>Joroth Brighthelm was a dwarf spy for the Lords' Alliance in Waterdeep in 1492 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1492 DR , Joroth was instructed to find Falkir's Fist , a band of four dwarf adventurers that disappeared in Undermountain in 1491 DR just after thieving the famous emerald called the Eye of the Spider from the Mirabarran embassy in Waterdeep. So at the Yawning Portal Joroth hired some adventurers that had previously found Kressando Rosznar to accomplish the mission.</p>
