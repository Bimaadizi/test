<p>Bui the Hog was a gambler. In 1374Â DR , she played Three-Dragon Ante against Warian Datharathi , Yasha , and Shem somewhere north of Cathyr in Dambrath , but went too deep into debt to continue throughout the evening. Before Warian was able to claim the accumulated pot, she taunted him and then attacked him with a broken chair leg; after Yasha restrained him, he discovered the powers of his plangent arm. He freed himself from Yasha and struck Bui down. To the gambler's judgement, Bui may have had orcish blood or been a northern berserker .</p>
