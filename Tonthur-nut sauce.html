<p>Tonthur-nut sauce was a condiment made out of tonthur nuts harvested from the mountainous areas in Amn , Tethyr , near Starmantle , Turmish , and the Vilhon Reach , often used to give flavor to bland foods like potatoes or cover up the cook's mistakes.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>To make the sauce, tonthur nuts were crushed and then boiled with a number of spices . The resulting sauce was a thick brown condiment with mouth-sizzling spicy heat. The sauce also inherited the heavy body from the natural fats that tonthur was fulled with. The sauce also had a nutty, peppercorny , and mushroomy flavor.</p>
<p>The sauce was packed in small clay jars. Their tops were sealed and, once the sauce was used up, the jars were used to store oils and other similar substances.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the 15 th century DR , tonthur-nut sauce was sold by merchant caravans and drovers all along the Sword Coast , the Tashalar , and anywhere else the Calishite merchants traveled.</p>
