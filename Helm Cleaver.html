<p>The Helm Cleaver , also known as Ghagorbad , was a powerful enchanted battleaxe that was in high demand by the orog allies of the Cult of the Dragon in 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Enormous in size, the Helm Cleaver had a wide blade imbued with magic.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Helm Cleaver possessed a +4 enchantment and magically enhanced the wielder's strength to compensate for the axe's size and weight.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR , the Helm Cleaver was in possession of the Cult of the Dragon that occupied the ruins of Myth Drannor . For one reason or the other, the cult's mercenary orog allies devised an unusually cunning plan, for their kin, to betray the humans and claim the enchanted axe for themselves. The orogs parleyed with a group of adventurers known as the Veiled Ones , offering the joint attack on the Cult of the Dragon members in the Halls of Light of the Dwarven Dungeons. The adventurers were tasked to go through the main door of the cult's stronghold, goaded by one of the orogs who craved the Helm Cleaver , while the rest of them attacked from the flank. Even though the plan was successful, the final faith of the enchanted axe remained unclear.</p>
