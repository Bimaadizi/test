<p>Frost agate , also called frost stone , was a beautiful member of the agate family found in the Realms. They were sacred to the elven god Erevan Ilesere .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These rare ornamental stones had white markings that resembled frost over the base color of the stone. They were usually tumbled and polished to a beautiful glassy finish. A master lapidarist could cut the fragile stone in facets , such as in a polyhedron cut, so that at each point where facets met, a "snowflake" of white "frost" appeared. A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Frost agates were often enchanted to be luckstones . Low quality stones were treated like other agates: powdered for use in sleeping draughts and other potions. Frost agate in particular was useful when mixing potions together as it nearly always prevented an explosive or poisonous result.</p>
