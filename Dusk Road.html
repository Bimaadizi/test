<p>The Dusk Road was a moderately traveled trade road in the Western Heartlands of Faer√ªn . The Dusk Road started at Elturel in the Fields of the Dead near the River Chionthar and headed northeast, eventually forming a great arc around the Reaching Woods until it ended at Iriaebor (also on the north bank of the Chionthar, but much farther upstream) at the west end of Trader's Road . Along the way, it crossed the east fork of the Trade Way at Triel , the little village of Hardbuckler , and Hill's Edge in the Sunset Vale . It continued on to Corm Orp , and bent south to pass through Hluthvar , then met the Uldoon Trail at Asbravn , and finally linked with Trader's Road at Iriaebor.</p>
