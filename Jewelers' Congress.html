<p>The Jewelers' Congress was a guildhall in Daggerford that was shared by the local Jeweler's Guild and the Whitesmiths' Guild.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The guildhall was located at the junction of the Farmer's Road and Duke's Way in central Daggerford.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The building resembled something of a massive vault, akin to this that could be found within the walls of a bank. Each of the building's entryways were heavily reinforced and it well-guarded by both the local constables as well as the Daggerford militia .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>In addition to being a meeting place for two guilds, the Jewelers' Congress served as a holding area for gems and precious metals.</p>
<p>Guild members could store their valuables within the guildhall, for a small fee based on the inherent value of what was being safeguarded.</p>
