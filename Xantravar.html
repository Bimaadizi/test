<p>Xantravars , also known as stinging horrors , were a bizarre species of deadly predators found near inland bodies of water.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The floating body of a xantravar consisted of two tough, highly elastic, teardrop-shaped balloons of roughly the same size. These bulbs were mottled, ranging in color from wine-red to gray. Each of the xantravars' bulbs ended in strong corded muscles, with an identical hollow bone stinger at their base. The location of the creature's brain among all this, if one did exist, was uncertain.</p>
<p>Above each of these stingers were a set of eight eyes, that ringed around each body stalk. Above the eyes, encircling each body-stalk, was a ring of indentations that emitted ventral jets of hydrogen gas from inside the creature. This expulsion of gas allowed xantravars to steer their body or sink closer to the ground; conversely, the intake of air through those vents made the xantravars rise. And above these jets, in the large head of each bulb, were two flotation chambers where the hydrogen gas was stored. Puncturing these flotation chambers was severely harmful to the xantravar.</p>
<p>The body bulbs were joined together by ceaseless, glowing energy field that smelled of ozone. the length of this field could vary, but the balloons were typically side-by-side with a distance apart of 2 feet (0.61 meters). When hunting or exploring, they could be seen as far apart as 20 feet (6.1 meters) and vertically separated by up to 12 feet (3.7 meters). The energy field also looked together the network of nerves that ran throughout each body bulb.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Their eyesight was comparable to that of a human and they could see in infravision . They possessed an immunity to all known toxins and a basic magic resistance .</p>
<p>The xantravars' field of energy was natural in nature, unaffected by things such as dispel magic , but would disrupt other fields of force that made contact with it. This field of energy notably separated hydrogen from the surrounding air or water. This effect of the field could be augmented by spells involving heat, electrical energy, or magical energy. However, the body bulbs of a xantravar were vulnerable to such attacks and would be simultaneously harmed.</p>
<p>One of the xantravars' two stingers contained a paralyzing poison , which would inject creatures at the merest scratch. Once used, it took the xantravar some minutes to replenish their toxins. Those that managed to resist the effects of their sting would be forever immune to that particular xantravar's venom.</p>
<p>The other stinger of a xantravar was a feeding instrument. Through a strong suction force it drew blood, sap, or nutrient fluid from their prey.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>These creatures preferred to hunt at night or in the concealment of heavy fog. During any serious combat, a xantraver would seek to protect itself by separating its body bulbs by up to 10 feet (3 meters).</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>The xantravar were rather shrouded in mystery. They were believed to hunt alone, but coexisted peacefully with others of their kind in deep flooded caverns or swamps during the day. During that time they avoided large, active creatures and fed instead on plants or disabled prey.</p>
<p>Xantravars were a hermaphroditic species. They seldom ever mated, but when they did xantravars joined their hollow stingers together and produced a balloon-like egg. This would drift alone on the breeze, unattended, for weeks. During such time the egg would absorb hydrogen and nutrients from the air. Eventually, this egg would burst to reveal a miniature version of the xantravar, with body bulbs measuring 2 feet (0.61 meters) in length. These infants fended for themselves and would grow rapidly to their adult size.</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Xantravars primarily lived on a diet of blood, sap, and bodily nutrients. Though they could also dine upon vegetation.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Xantravars were typically found in swamps, salt marshes, and remote seacoasts with tidal caverns. They could be found in moors throughout much of northwest Faerûn , particularly the Mere of Dead Men .</p>
