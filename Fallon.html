<p>Fallon was a Nentyar hunter in 1373 DR . He betrayed the Nentyarch and kidnapped Araluen , intending to render her unto the Rotting Man ; he eventually turned against his masters, but was slain in the process on Mirtul 7 of that same year.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>While on garrison, Fallon wore dark green leather armor, and a silver leaf pin clasping a sea-green cloak.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Fallon was somewhat of a stickler for protocol who had a mild antipathy for Elowen, often going out of his way to annoy her. He was somewhat bothered by mention of the fall of Dun-Tharos. He also had an usually sour disposition, and a particular thirst for praise. He also had a bit of a covetous, envious streak. All of those seemed to stem from a certain egotism.</p>
<p>Though Anammelech had been the one to cultivate a relationship with him, he eventually came to serve the Rotting Man without any protest- albeit out of fear rather than loyalty.</p>
<p>However, he still had at his core a certain respect for life.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Fallon was still a hunter trained by the Circle of Leth whose survival skills were superlative. He also knew of the way to employ the Keystone effectively, being able to use both created portals and allowing other influences into the Celestial Nadir .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Of note, Fallon had been granted several special arrows by the Nentyarch .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Anammelech had been Fallon's handler for some time. He went out of his way to annoy Elowen.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before 1373 DR , Fallon was already Anammelech's ears in the Nentyarch's court, in exchange for gold.</p>
<p>Fallon was amongst the Yeshelmaar garrison that greeted Elowen when she arrived there alongside Araluen in 1373 DR . He attended the meeting with the Nentyarch the day after, where he was named one of the people that would accompany Araluen in her quest to confront the Rotting Man .</p>
<p>He suggested to Elowen's group that they meet at Yeshelmaar's Skymeadow as a distraction while he collected the keystone and Araluen, then took them to the Arches of Xenosi while the party was away; they barely managed to catch up to the door he opened into the Celestial Nadir . Fallon emerged on the Arches of Xenosi, where he rendered the keystone upon Anammelech, who set up an ambush and sent him on his way to the Rotting Man. He was contacted directly by the Rotting Man, telepathically, on Anammelech's death, and given orders to proceed through an underground route, as well as a magical compulsion to obey the Talontyr's orders.</p>
<p>While underground, in a moment of hesitation, the compulsion thereatened to destroy his mind; it was only Araluen's intervention that stopped it. Relieved, Fallon decided to switch sides again. He placed an ambush for one of Damanda 's underlings in a hidden vault, easily slaying Ezekial . On reaching the surface, however, he was soon captured by Damanda; upon learning that Araluen's touch disintegrated vampires in a flash of light, she decided to keep him alive so that he could keep her moving. Nonetheless, he prepared a stake while they prepared to ambush the party coming after him.</p>
<p>When the party finally caught up to the zone where the vampires were ready for the ambush, Fallon cleverly clued them as to the fact he wasn't alone. He turned agains the vampires, however, just in time to prevent Lex from slaying Elowen; he staked her, but she retaliated just before disintegrating, slaying Fallon.</p>
<p>After his death, Fallon was redeemed by Araluen. She challenged the Rotting Man that same night, placing the day of his death as Mirtul 7 .</p>
