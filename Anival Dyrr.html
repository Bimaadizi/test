<p>During the Silence of Lolth , in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , House Agrach Dyrr entered into a secret alliance with the Jaezred Chaulssin and betrayed Menzoberranzan's Army of the Black Spider to the armies of Gracklstugh and Kaanyr Vhok .</p>
<p>After the house's betrayal was revealed, the house compound was besieged by House Xorlarrin and its allies. With the destruction of the house temple by Gromph Baenre , both Yasraena and the Lichdrow Dyrr , the true leader of the house, were definitively annihilated. Anival was the highest-ranking surviving member of her house. She was approached by Triel Baenre , who offered the survival of her house and her appointment as matron mother in exchange for becoming the vassal of House Baenre for centuries. With no other option, Anival accepted the offer.</p>
