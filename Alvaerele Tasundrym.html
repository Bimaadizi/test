<p>Alvaerele Tasundrym , also known as the Silent Chosen , was a half-elf wizard who was both a Magister and a Chosen of Mystra .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Alvaerele was a sage who specialized in healing, good food, and beneficial herbs for humans and demihumans . During her free time, Alvaerele had managed to master minor magic . She lived in Zazesspur .</p>
<p>In the 576 DR , after Magister Annath Sunfall renounced Mystra and all magic because of his failed experiments, his position was offered to Alvaerele during a grand feast that she had been invited to in exchange for procuring some rare wine . When Azuth appeared before her, two other wizards at the feast immediately attacked. Azuth turned away their spells , apologized for appearing in such a public place and wiped everyone's memories of his appearance (though onlooking kitchen staff retained theirs). Later, Alvaerele accepted Azuth's offer but timidly informed him that she would concentrate her efforts on her work as a sage over and above her magisterial spellcraft. Azuth loved her for that and she enjoyed his personal protection from then on.</p>
<p>In the 592 DR , while out collecting herbs, she encountered a sick man. When she went to minister his illness, he spat forth a gout of spell-born acid . Azuth shielded her from the attack, and Alvaerele petrified the offending mage, turning his acidic spit into an everlasting fountain, creating the site that became known as Wizardgout Water . Upset at having to mete out similar punishments to her attackers and how they would try to reach her through her friends, she petitioned Mystra for another method to serve. Mystra made Alvaerele a Chosen and Ozgor "the Black Scourge" Hyelvel was granted the position in her stead.</p>
<p>Since then, Alvaerele was tasked with guarding the most powerful secrets of magic, such as the location of the Srinshee 's resting place. Alvaerele always performed her tasks in an alternate form or invisibly and spent her free time in secluded magical groves, which earned her the moniker of the Silent Chosen.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR , Alvaerele helped defend Glarondar from a Thayan attack while the Simbul was away. Five years later, Alvaerele killed twelve Red Wizards who were attacking Velprintalar in an attempt to draw out the Simbul (who again, was away at the time) and sent the magical trap they were planning to use against rivals of its creators, thereby causing internal strife in Thay .</p>
<p>Alvaerele later participated in the High Magic Ritual of Myriad on the Feast of the Moon , the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , to cleanse part of the High Moor and restore Faer'tel'miir , a lost city of Miyeritar .</p>
