<p>Deep Speech was the language of aberrations , an alien form of communication originating in the Far Realm . It had no native script of its own, but when written by mortals it used the Espruar script, as it was first transcribed by the drow due to frequent contact between the two groups stemming from living in relatively close proximity within the Underdark.</p>
