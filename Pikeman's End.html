<h2>History</h2>
<p>This sword's first recorded owner was an infamous bandit lord who raided villages and ravaged peasant militias of the Western Heartlands sometime before 1281 DR . This blade received its name from Kath Tahl's devastating battle strategy that breached a line of militia pikes by sending heavily armored troops in sowing disarray and chopping the polearms into splinters. Once pikemen were broken, he sent in the cavalry to take anything the warlord wanted. Eventually, Pikeman's End ended up in the hands of Marhap the Blackbeard , Kath Tahl's rival warlord, after he defeated Kath's men and killed the bandit.</p>
<p>By 1281 DR, Pikeman's End ended up in the possession of the blacksmith Conlan in Kuldahar .</p>
