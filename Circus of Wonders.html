The circus traveled throughout Tethyr and other regions in southern Faer√ªn and was used by Corvus as a cover for his activities as a spy for various factions. Acts included clowns, historical reenactments, a strongman and aerial performances. Prominent members around 1479 DR included Tobin , Mattias Farseer , Trill , and the twin halfling aerialists Shan and Cynda .</p>
