<p>Silent Helpers were priestesses that composed a portion of the clergy of Shiallia , the Lady of the Woods.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>What differentiated Silent Helpers from the rest of Shiallia's clergy was the work they were focused on. Silent Helpers watched over lost children and others who were simply unaware of the dangers lurking within the woods, specifically the High Forest . The famous bard Olithard was believed to have been rescued by a trio of Silent Helpers.</p>
