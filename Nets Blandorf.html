<p>Nets Blandorf was a fisherman from the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nets was a gold dwarf man with bronze skin tone, blue eyes, and black hair. He wore his facial hair trimmed into bushy muttonchops.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , as the Absolute crisis ravaged the Gate, Nets Blandorf's fishing business was damaged further by pollution of the Gray Harbor . Fishers in the Lower City continued pulling nets filled with fish covered in black oily goo. Nets Blandorf could not understand how fish could be dirty as it came from water. He assumed that his nets were dirty and needed a good scrub so they won't dirty the catch. In reality, the fish was smothered in oil pollution left behind by a submersible used by the Cult of Bane to transport Lord Gortash 's prisoners into the drowned Iron Throne headquarters prison at the bottom of Gray Harbor.</p>
