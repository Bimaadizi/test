<p>A moray eel was a large type of eel with a deadly bite.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These eels were larger and more dangerous than typical eels. Moray eels could weigh up to 100 pounds (45 kilograms) and grow to be around 5 feet (1.5 meters) long.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Although not the most fearsome opponents an adventurer could face, one still had to be wary of these eels, as they had a deadly bite. It was even possible for a moray eel to cleanly bite an entire arm off of a body.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Moray eels were often found in locathah lairs, where they acted as keepers and sentries.</p>
<p>In Serôs , the great undersea realm, moray eels, lobsters , and octopuses were considered natural enemies of one another.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , the shalarin priestess , Tu'ala'keth , conjured a menacing underwater world with coral formations, where moray eels lurked amidst other threats in a limitless ocean.</p>
