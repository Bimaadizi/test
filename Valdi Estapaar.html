<p>Valdi Estapaar was the half-elf overseer of the fishing business and a member of the town council of Leilon in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Valdi was an elderly half-elven woman.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>When Leilon was resettled in the late 15 th century DR, Valdi was assigned to supervise the fishing business that was meant to sustain the town's construction. The caught fish was used to feed the population, while the surplus was cured and sold in surrounding cities.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Valdi was one of the most powerful people in town during its reconstruction, thanks to the quayside's recent opening. She owed her position to Dagult Neverember , Lord Protector of Neverwinter .</p>
<p>Valdi was friends with Kristoffen , the dragonborn captain of the Ice Floe .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point in the late 15 th century DR, after having torn down and neutralized the High Tower of Thalivar in the center of Leilon, Dagult Neverember had become interested in rebuilding the town as part of the trade route along the High Road south to Waterdeep . He named Valdi one of the three founding members of the town council, along with Grizzelda Copperwraught and Merrygold Brightshine , and put her in charge of the town's fishing business.</p>
<p>Circa 1491 DR , Leilon was attacked by the Cult of Talos and the townsfolk and laborers were driven out. Valdi was at a loss for what to do, considering no one except Sergeant Hazz Yorrum was a fighter. Luckily, a group of adventurers arrived just in time to reclaim the town. It was subsequently discovered that the followers of Talos used the Thunder Cliff Caves , which were only accessible by water, as their base of operations in the region. Valdi helped the adventurers find a captain to take them there. She suggested Kristoffen , the dragonborn captain of the Ice Floe , as well as Stands in Tar , the tabaxi captain of the Dancing Delight . The adventurers then cleared the caves of the threats there.</p>
<p>The same group of adventurers would be called upon to perform several services to help Leilon grow and to protect it from rising threats from both followers of Talos and followers of Myrkul , culminating in the Battle of Leilon . During the combat, Valdi was pinned underneath an overturned rowboat and attacked by a boneclaw , but the adventurers came to rescue her.</p>
