<p>The Serpent Valley was a river valley lying east of Doegan in the Utter East .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A tortuously winding river snaked through the Serpent Valley, deep amidst the untamed hills. All around, the land was marshy or swampy, leaving islands and patches of firmer ground within the loops of the river. The land was green and fertile.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Here, beefy, club-wielding trolls stood their ground and giant snapping turtles lurked in the river. Rocs also made their great nests by the water.</p>
<p>Some bandits and hardy folk lived in the Serpent Valley, building pleasant-looking thatched roof cottages and farms, but life was rigorous and desperate, with mere survival the top priority.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>The Serpent Valley was known as a hard and fearsome place, where bandits laired, the most enduring survivalists made their homes, and only the bravest dared trespass. The river was thought dark and mysterious.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the time of the Bloodforge Wars ( 648 – 657 DR ), the Serpent Valley was the site of bloodforge battles waged between Rathgar the Raider , conqueror of Doegan , and Aelric the Avenger , who sought to liberate the realm, in the Howl of Vengeance conflict.</p>
<p>Later, the Serpent Valley was the hideout and mustering area of the infamous brigand and bloodforge mage Wenda Wildeye . The leader of the Legendary Campaign came to put an end to the banditry.</p>
<p>Haden Stonehand made a home in the Serpent Valley. The leader of the Legendary Campaign, who aimed to unify the Utter East through conquest, returned to challenge Haden in a contest of bloodforge warfare.</p>
<p>Finally, Newt Longscar mustered and trained a bloodforge army in the Serpent Valley to fight against the advancing leader of the Legendary Campaign. The leader tried to strike first before Newt was fully prepared and established.</p>
