<p>Eyes of charming were a set of magical eyes that allowed the wearer to charm others.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Eyes of charming were a pair of crystal lenses (typically made of blue quartz ) that fitted over the users' eyes. It was possible to wear only one of the eyes, instead of the pair, though this was far less effective.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These eyes stored three charges, and these charges would refresh at sunrise. When worn, the wearer could use a charge to charm another person that they could see, provided the other person was within 30 ft (9.1 m). However, it was possible for the target to avoid being charmed.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 14 th century DR , the lizardmen that inhabited the sixth level of the deep mines of New Verdigris had a set of eyes of charming amongst their stash of treasure.</p>
