<p>A derivation cloak was an enchanted cloak that radiated a healing aura if the wearer used poison against their foes.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The cloak's deadly derivation enchantment healed the wearer every time they dealt poison damage or simply poisoned a creature.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the derivation cloak was created by a crazed alchemist who was attempting to find a way to sap youth from his victims through poisoning. The first attempts were done via magical formulae but the cloak proved to be much more reliable. With time, one such cloak ended up in the hands of the necromancer named Balthazar , who kept it in his workshop within the Moonrise Towers of Reithwin during the Absolute crisis .</p>
