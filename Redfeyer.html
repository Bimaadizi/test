<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Redfeyer was a human male who wore brightly-colored clothes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Redfeyer made a living singing and performing for the folk of Rassatan. One day he heard a rumor of a strangely mesmerizing and beautiful Singing Caverns east of Rassatan and a treasure hidden in its depths. Redfeyer traveled along the Sanrach Mountains but found the caverns to be a perilous lair of giant spiders and angry bats . Once inside, Redfeyer's magical pendant, used to harmonize with during performances â€“ the singing pendant , started doing just that, sing. The music attracted the hungry inhabitants of the cave, and Redfeyer fled with numerous bites, scratches, and wounds, losing his prized necklace in the process.</p>
<p>Disheartened by the loss of his beloved item he lovingly referred to as "she", Redfeyer was drinking his sadness away in the Forgotten Pearl tavern in Samargol. The singer hoped to find an able-bodied adventure willing to venture into the Singing Caverns and retrieve the pendant. Redfeyer offered the cavern's alleged treasure as a payment to those brave enough to help.</p>
