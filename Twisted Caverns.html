<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In addition to the wide variety of fungi, a number of species of creatures native to the depths Underdark could be found within the Twisted Caverns. A tribe of Kuo-toa formed their nesting caves within a small, subterranean lake that was fed by the River of the Depths. Other creatures of the caverns included bats, ettins , troglodytes , piercers , ropers , xorn , giant spiders , hook horrors , darkmantles , driders and even a single, particularly cruel quasit .</p>
<p>An aboleth referred to as Illuun made its lair in the flooded cavern that was previously inhabited by kuo-toa. Its mere presence tainted the water and killed the schools of fish that sustained the fish-like humanoids . The aberrant monstrosity was accompanied by its pet chuuls and enslaved troglodytes .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime during the 15 th century, the mage Darribeth Meltimer went mad after she encountered a demonic force within the Underdark. After her descent into madness, she took refuge within a cave in the Twisted Caverns. She was tormented by the quasit she referred to as "Teeha", who often transformed itself into a toad that offered Darribeth false means of escape.</p>
<p>After they descended down from Stromkuhldur , drow from House Auvryndar established an outpost within the Twisted Caverns. They were led by the priestess of Lolth Melith Auvryndar and her consort Thirza Helviiryn .</p>
<p>Some time around the Year of the Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a green slaad was let loose within the caverns after its control gem was stolen by the "Mad Mage" . While in the caverns, the aberrant shape-changer took the form of a human and referred to himself as The Alchemist . He spent his time bargaining for material components in order to brew his potions , all while searching for his lost control gem .</p>
<p>The kuo-toa tribe that previously lived around the lake within the Grotto of Madness were driven out by the aboleth Illuun by the Year of the Purple Dragons, 1493 DR .</p>
