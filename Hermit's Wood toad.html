<p>The Hermit's Wood toad was a breed of frog or toad found near Hermit's Wood in Cormyr .</p>
<p>It was green with reddish striations and had eyes that were unusually large. Incredibly, these animals had the ability to see invisible creatures, even invisible creatures from other planes . They tended to make a very loud noise when they spotted an invisible being.</p>
<p>The Hermit's Wood toad was previously thought to be only a local myth. However, Lucas Surin discovered it to be true when he went on a hunting party and a thief with a ring of invisibility thought to use the magic to scout ahead and stalk a deer . He strayed too near a group of frogs sitting in the sun by a stream, when they were alerted, only settling when he removed the ring. The hunters chose to study the frogs instead; Lucas wrote of it in 1367 DR .</p>
