<p>Sulo's Hook was an enchanted parrying dagger that gained notoriety whilst in possession of Captain "Baron" Sulo of Luskan , sometime before the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sulo's Hook had a peculiar design, created to be specifically used for parrying by duelists.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The blade was relatively harmless as a weapon, making it hard to wield it offensively. However, the item's wide handguard and enchantments made it invaluable for defense, guiding the welder's hand towards the enemy's blows, deflecting them harmlessly.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The dagger's origin was unknown, but its first recorded wielder was an infamous corsair Sulo. He first encountered the magic weapon while performing a sea heist off the coast of Port Llast , acquiring the jewels of the Leberm family of the Sword Coast North . Sulo faced a band of experienced adventurers who were guarding the precious cargo. One of the adventurers was wielding two identical parrying daggers. The duelist slew several corsairs and severed Sulo's left hand. With Lady Luck's or her grim sister's blessing, the adventurer was killed by a stray ballista shot, saving "Baron" Sulo's life. The duelist was dragged into the water, leaving behind only one of his daggers. That blade became known as Sulo's Hook after the corsair fashioned a prosthetic out of it.</p>
<p>Sulo's Hook remained attached to the corsair's stump for the next nine years until his death. The weapon was interred with its owner in a hidden tomb along with a significant treasure that the pirate accumulated through his career. The burial sight, however, was not as secret as once thought, and soon after, it was robbed, and Sulo's Hook changed owners since then.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , Sulo's Hook was found on a body of a man who perished within the Fell Wood , east of the village of Kuldahar , high on the Spine of the World . The dagger's owner was likely lured into the forest by its population of hungry will-o'-wisp , where he perished by a stone circle.</p>
