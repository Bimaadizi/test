<p>Lymn was a tiefling Harper who followed the Harper hero Jaheira to the Shadow-cursed lands in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lymn was a not-very-talkative hellish -looking crimson-skinned female tiefling with burning red eyes. The tiefling wore padded leather armor that proudly displayed her Harper pin . .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Jaheira was alerted to the mysterious return of Ketheric Thorm , now a leader of a cultist army that worshiped the Absolute . Harper Lymn was one of the agents who accompanied Jaheira into the Shadow-cursed lands surrounding the Moonrise Towers â€”General Thorm's seat of power.</p>
<p>When a group of True Souls arrived at the Last Light Inn , which the Harpers had claimed as a temporary base, Lymn was among those present for the events that followed. It was unknown if Harper Lymn survived the war with the Absolute; she might've perished after the Last Light Inn was consumed by the darkness or else she survived with the rest, storming the Moonrise Towers to end General Thorm's reign.</p>
