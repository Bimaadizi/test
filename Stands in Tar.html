<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1491 DR , Valdi Estapaar , who was a member of the Leilon town council, was looking to hire a ship to transport a group of adventurers to the Thunder Cliff Caves . The caves at the foot of the Thunder Cliffs were used as a hideout by the Cult of Talos , which had previously attacked Leilon, and were only accessible by sea. Stands in Tar competed with Kristoffen , the dragonborn captain of the Ice Floe , for the job. Though the Thundercliffs were considered dangerous, Stands in Tar was undeterred. The adventurers then cleared the caves of the threats there.</p>
