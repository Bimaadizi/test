<p>The Red Griffon Room was a chamber in the High Palace of Silverymoon during the 14 th century DR that contained a dead magic zone .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The room was stately, its walls lined with duskwood panels. There was a polished table for meetings, and many chairs; the chairposts were decorated with scarlet-colored carved griffons .</p>
<p>The room was very stuffy, with no way in or out beyond the door. A copper heat-turned fan hung from a curved rod, over a candle-lamp, acting as the only ventilation available.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The room was built around a dead magic zone , and thus magic did not really work in there, with very few exceptions known to include some abilities of the Chosen of Mystra . To verify the zone wasn't tampered with, there was a coin hidden in one hollow carving that held a burning spell . If the spell was ever able to resume, the coin would burn away.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The room was created after a wizardly duel following a Mage Fair led to the inception of a dead-magic zone inside one of the palace's rooms. After praying to Mystra , Alustriel decided to preserve the zone rather than remedy it. The room was rebuilt and divided in two, with the dead-magic zone becoming the Red Griffon Room.</p>
<p>The trader Garthin Muirtree requested the Red Griffon Room in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR for a meeting with Auvrarn Labraster , whom he heard employed a "sneaking magic". But he was mysteriously murdered in that same room; he was recorded to have also met on the day before his death with Dauphran Alskyte , Draevin Flarwood , Janthasarde Ilbright , and Oscalar Maerbree .</p>
