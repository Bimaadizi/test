<p>Thavverdasz was a powerful lich of the 13 th century DR and the self-styled Harper King who played a key role in the events following the Harpstar Wars . He was once an ally of both the Cult of the Dragon and Harper bard Rundorl Moonsklan , though he ultimately betrayed them all in his bid for power.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>Thavverdasz dwelled in a cave on the edge of the Vast Swamp , within the Thunder Peaks north of Daerlun .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before his rise as the Harper King, he was already allied with the Cult of the Dragon.</p>
<p>During the aftermath of the Harpstar Wars , the ambitious Harper bard Rundorl, in desperation after being betrayed by Szass Tam , sought out Thavverdasz to aid in intercepting the undead Harpers under Szass's control. Rundorl offered him the service of the Harpers and their hoarded magical treasures in exchange for help. Thavverdasz agreed—but promptly took over Rundorl's mind and assumed his hoped-for title of "Harper King" himself.</p>
<p>With Rundorl transformed into his undead servant, Thavverdasz took control of the reanimated Harpers and set out to subjugate the living ones. He manipulated the Cult of the Dragon into supporting his cause until he betrayed them as well, stealing a large cache of gems meant for the dracolich Khalahmongre .</p>
<p>In retaliation, the Cult rallied its forces, and Szass Tam—humiliated by how easily Thavverdasz had broken his control—sent a powerful magical simulacrum of himself to attack Thavverdasz's lair, now called the Court of the Harper King, in the Year of the Horn, 1222 DR . The battle between the two liches devastated the surrounding swamp as Thavverdasz's magical wards redirected Szass's spells outward, annihilating both undead Harper and Cultist forces. Eventually, Thavverdasz destroyed Szass Tam's magical projection using a potent magical item. The backlash disrupted Szass Tam's senses, leaving him incapacitated in Thay for years. In the aftermath, as Thavverdasz claimed victory, he proudly addressed the skull of a Harper he slew long ago—only for it to transform into the face of Elminster and explode. Severely weakened, Thavverdasz was destroyed when Elminster arrived in person, ending the lich's reign.</p>
