<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally a house in Menzoberranzan, House Nasadra fought against House S'sril and was exiled, along with others, from the city by House Baenre , which had received the favor of Lolth . After many decades of exile, in −3843 DR Lolth's avatar appeared to House Nasadra and the other exiles, leading them to the current location of Ched Nasad and instructing them to found another city honoring Lolth and remaining friendly with Menzoberranzan.</p>
<p>In 1372 DR , during the duergar attack on House Melarn and the city, Matron Mother Aunrae Nasadra and four other matrons summoned a huge guardian spider . They lost control of the spider and it contributed to the city's downfall.</p>
