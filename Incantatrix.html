<p>An incantatrix , also known as an incantatar for males or the gender-neutral (but less accurate) metamage , was a skilled practitioner of metamagic in Faerûn . These individuals studied and shaped spells in their raw effects. They could modify the spells of allies, magic items , and even active spells cast by another incantatrix.</p>
<p>Throughout their extensive training, incantatrixes assumed a number of ranked titles, including 'dweomaedar', 'memurge', 'weirworker', and 'spellbinder'.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>The majority of incantatrixes were female, mostly skilled wizards or sorcerers along with a small number of bards . Very few clerics or druids explored this path as they relied on extraplanar entities, which strongly conflicted with the incantatrix's methods. They disliked these beings and had a particular fondness for magic that thwarted extraplanar beings. Incantatrixes actively sought out and destroyed planar portals and gates .</p>
<p>Many of their kind chose to live in solitude, often exhibiting feelings of paranoia in regards to other people. In the same way that druids protected the forest or other stretch of natural land, so to did incantatrixes protected the area around their home from unrestrained or extraplanar use of magic.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Due to the area of magic in which incantatrixes studied, they gained the benefits of being specialized in the school of abjuration . They were forced to forego their studies in any school in which they specialized, with the exception of abjuration and divination .</p>
<p>Incantatrixes immediately begin their studies in metamagic, learning to read magic , identify spells as they were being cast, as well as enhance spells cast by their allies. Over time they gained the ability to apply their metamagic enhancements to spells that were already in effect, and even magical items that possessed an active spell trigger .</p>
<p>Incantatrixes were especially potent at banishing outsiders . These powers could also be used to dispel any monsters that were summoned through spells .</p>
<p>With a hardy spirit, the incantatrix became immune to death magic and effects that drained life energy. Over time they even gained a sort of affinity into the ethereal plane , allowing them to see into that realm and strike out against ethereal beings with their magic.</p>
<p>More advanced training in their arts allowed these casters to "steal" spells from other mages while they were deep in concentration, and even take away control of spell effects after they have been released. Some of the more powerful incantatrixes could even drain certain magic items of their arcane charges, and use the dweomers to heal their own bodies.</p>
<p>The most experienced incantatrixes who mastered metamagic could wield their powers with great efficiency. They did not have to expend the same mental resources as their less experienced counterparts.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the mid–14 th century DR , there were only seven verified incantatrixes and two incantatars known throughout all the Realms of Faerûn , though it was suspected that as many as a hundred lived undetected.</p>
<p>Before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , incantatrixes had specialized in their own distinct school of incantation .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>It was speculated that the person known as The Mage of the Stars was actually an incantatar.</p>
