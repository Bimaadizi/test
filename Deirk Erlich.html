<h2>History</h2>
<p>Deirk lived with his family in the slums of Hillsfar until circa 1486 DR , when his brother Haakon Erlich , a officer of the Red Plumes , told him that the Tinfellow Farm was now vacant and he could take him there. Deirk, with his sons and a carpenter, started repairing the farm along with Baar , when an adventuring party arrived asking about the Tinfellow family. Deirk lied to them, saying that he had lived here for years and had recently been attacked by elves .</p>
