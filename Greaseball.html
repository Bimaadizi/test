<p>Greaseballs were a rare variety of an ooze that could be summoned to the Prime Material plane by some mages alongside grease mephits and grease elementals .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like other ooze creatures, greaseballs were living organisms made entirely out of grease and resembled blobs of pulsating slick oily mass. They possessed low animal-like intelligence and could perform only the simplest tasks when compelled by their summoners.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Greaseballs were slow-moving creatures that left a thick coat of grease behind as they moved, similar to the effects of the grease spell . The grease secretions were highly flammable and the creatures' own bodies were highly vulnerable to fire. However, they were resistant to slashing and electricity.</p>
<p>In battle, they simply slammed at their opponents with pseudopods.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the mad sewer-dwelling grease-mage named Aelis Siryasius inhabited the sewers of Baldur's Gate . His small patch of sewers was infested with a small army of grease mephits, grease elementals, and greaseballs.</p>
