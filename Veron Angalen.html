<p>Veron Angalen was a half-orc bounty hunter of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He was originally from Silverymoon . Unlike many half-orcs who were the result of a non-consensual union between a human female and a male orc , Veron's orcish mother and human father were married and loved each other.</p>
<p>In 1478 DR , Veron accepted a commission to track down a supposedly mad woman named Nestrix who had killed a wizard in Cormyr . He tracked her to Waterdeep and, while attempting to apprehend her, became caught up in a plot by a green dragon , Andareunarthex , to steal magic items that would allow him to bypass Waterdeep's dragonward .</p>
<p>Veron helped rescue Nestrix, who was really a blue dragon that had been plaguechanged into a human woman, from Andareunarthex. Later, he helped to defeat the green dragon and drive him from Waterdeep.</p>
