<p>The Empty-Scabbard Killers , or Forak-Erach-Naek in an obscure Dwarvish dialect, were a legendary order of duergar psionic assassins in Gracklstugh , whom common people believed to be mythical. They were one of the most feared groups in the Underdark . They practiced disciplines unknown to even the savviest derro or the wisest priest. More than a myth, these killers had been plying their trade for centuries, their motives unknown and their methods inscrutable.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>Members were often assassins and soulknives , who could manifest a blade of psychic energy , hence the name "empty scabbard".</p>
<h2>Operations</h2>
<p>Empty-Scabbard Killers patrolled the streets of Gracklstugh searching for psionically gifted children to abduct and train. They even recruited gifted calassabrak (a kind of duergar outlaw shunned by other duergar).</p>
<p>They usually conducted deadly missions for a select few personalities of the city, such as Deepking Horgar Steelshadow V . However, they would work and kill for anyone who had the gold .</p>
<h2>Base</h2>
<p>The headquarters of the Forak-Erach-Naek was a well-guarded secret. However, those who would hire them knew they could get in contact with one of the killers in the Cave of Twelve Teeth , which stood by the edge of the Darklake just outside Gracklstugh. They were possibly based near the Darklake.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Empty-Scabbard Killers were already notorious by 1373 DR . By then, they'd recently extended their services to kidnapping for ransom.</p>
<p>Around 1374 DR , the Forak-Erach-Naek attempted to assassinate Urdol , the aboleth ruler of Dupapn . They failed, and Urdol declared war on the Forak-Erach-Naek in retaliation, a situation that would quickly and almost certainly erupt into chaos.</p>
<p>Circa 1486 DR , they—for unknown reasons—targeted the merchant Werz Saltbaron .</p>
