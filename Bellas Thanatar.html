<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bellas was formerly an adventurer and leader of Bellas's Band . Each member of the band grew wealthy by following Bellas's orders.</p>
<p>Around the 1330s DR, Bellas's Band took power in the city of Calaunt. Bellas named himself Supreme Scepter, while his followers each took the title of Merchant Duke . They now grew wealthier and powerful by following Bellas and supporting his rule.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>In all decisions on major policies, Bellas had two votes, while each of the dukes had only one vote.</p>
<p>Bellas and the rest of his cronies often confiscated property and magic from visitors to Calaunt, allegedly "for the benefit of the city", but mostly used it only for personal gain and use, to increase their power. They acquired a large collection of magical items this way, and still sought more. Bellas in particular was known to possess great many magical weapons and items of protection.</p>
