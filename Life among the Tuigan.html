<p>Life among the Tuigan was a book written by the lama Koja of Khazari in the early 1360s DR . It gave a careful and unbiased account of his experiences with the Tuigan people of the Hordelands and of the Horde .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following King Azoun IV 's crusade against the Tuigan Horde in the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , Koja was a guest of Azoun in Suzail , Cormyr , for over a year. While there, on the king's request, he wrote up an account of his experiences with the Tuigan and their culture. He was aided in this by Thom Reaverson , who worked on a similar project and provided Koja with translations and guidance.</p>
<p>Koja later dismissed it as an incomplete collection of notes about Tuigan customs, and felt that Reaverson put in an equal amount of work and written a more exhaustive account of the wars. Koja expanded his notes into A History of the Tuigan when he moved to Procampur in the Vast .</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>Despite Koja's skills as a military historian, his works said little about how the Tuigan breached the Dragonwall , suggesting that magic was used.</p>
<h2>Locations</h2>
<p>One copy was in the possession of King Azoun IV of Cormyr in the early 1360s DR . By 1362 DR , the temple of Deneir in Procampur had one copy of Life among the Tuigan , bound together with Reaverson's History of the Crusade .</p>
