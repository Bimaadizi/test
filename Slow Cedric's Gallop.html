<p>Slow Cedric's Gallop was a ruined frontier town on the perilous Southern Pass of the Spine of the World .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Not much was recorded of the village's life before it was wiped off the face of Toril . One office of the village was held by the Bell Warden, who was in charge of the town's tall stone belltower, used to signal danger, and who was to defend Slow Cedric's Gallop with their life. A self-made magic item called the Black Chimes‎‎ was considered the badge of office.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Slow Cedric's Gallop perished in the great winter of the Year of the Moonlight Tapestry, 1170 DR when the town was raided and raised by a tide of orcs that poured from the mountains. The town was discovered buried under the snow tides of the Spine of the World the following spring as the first of the brave travelers started moving along the Southern Pass. The only evidence of Slow Cedric's Gallop's existence was its tall belltower, almost completely buried under the snow, apart from just its steeple. Inside, travelers found blood-stained floor, several dead frozen orc corpses, and the enchanted heavy flail called the Black Chimes .</p>
