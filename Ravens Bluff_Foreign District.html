<p>The Foreign District of Ravens Bluff , formerly known as the Gardens of Opulent Splendor or simply the Gardens , was a quiet, walled-off region of the city that was home to the embassies and consulates of a number of foreign nations and powers.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It was located on the western side of the Bluff, just within the tall stone wall that partitioned it from the docks and the Altarside neighborhood of the Temple District . It stood within a ten minute walking distance of Crow's Foot and the Temple District.</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>The main feature of the district was Daren's Ring , a circular road that enveloped Ring Park and extended to Fireleap Lane which continued eastward into the city. The roads that curved away from the Ring were nameless and flanked by rows of yew trees, ornate topiaries and decorative lawns that were quite appealing, despite the lack of passers-by to appreciate the tranquil scenery.</p>
<h2>Law & Order</h2>
<p>The district was heavily patrolled by members of the the City Watch and the Griffon Guard . It was notably the only district in the city to lack a district barracks for the City Watch. Additionally, each of the embassies within its walls were staffed with their own guards.</p>
<p>The embassies within the district represented the native soil and the laws of their home countries, thus allowing for people to be punished under each diplomats' respective laws. In some cases, this could mean that entering an embassy without an invitation could be punishable by death.</p>
<p>Non-residents of the district generally had to have some form of invitation in order to enter.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Back when it was known as the Gardens, the first embassies to be set up in the district were meant to be only temporary housing for diplomats traveling to Ravens Bluff to open up new trade routes.</p>
<h2>Notable locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Due to the highly sensitive nature of the business conducted by the diplomats and foreign agents within the area, Ravenians were encouraged not to wander and explore its peaceful roads. This left the district as being rather lacking in activity within its clean and placid streets, save for patrols of the City Watch. Several adventurers kept their homes within the large and impressive buildings found in the district, but they by and large kept to themselves.</p>
<h2>Notable Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Some individuals that lived in the district that weren't adventurers included the following.</p>
