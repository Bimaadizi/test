<p>Lawgiver blades were enchanted bastard swords that were created for one and only purpose – to enforce law, when its authority was questioned or challenged.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Lawgiver possessed a simple +1 enchantments, however, if wielded against creatures of chaos and discord, the weapon effectively became a powerful +3 magic blade.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lawgivers were created sometime before the 14 th century DR to be used against creatures of chaos and individuals of dubious morals. Lawgiver swords enforced the law, regardless of whether the concepts of law and justice were aligned. Because of this, Lawgivers were often wielded in a very polarizing fashion throughout history.</p>
<p>As of the late 14 th century DR, a Lawgiver bastard sword could be procured in the docks of Neverwinter on the Sword Coast North . Another such blade was available from the Thayan enclave opened in Neverwinter after the Shadow War of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR .</p>
