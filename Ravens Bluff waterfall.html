<p>The Ravens Bluff waterfall was a geological feature among the Vastian city's hills that was considered unique for it being upwelling – its waters emerged from a fissure in the ground, coming off of an underground stream. The exact origins of the fall's water was unknown to most Ravenians.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These roaring falls fell off a cliff at a height of 200 feet (61 meters) and seemingly vanishing into the ground. At some point in the late 14 th century DR , the top of falls expanded into a body of water known as Lake Eternal.</p>
<p>Roughly 30 feet (9.1 meters) above the base of the falls, situated behind the waterfall itself, was a ledge running along the cliff face that protruded out 6​ to ​8 feet (1.8​ to ​2.4 meters). Leading from the middle of this ledge was an opening in the cliff face, a crevice measuring 12 feet (3.7 meters) high and 4 feet (1.2 meters) wide. The narrow, mist choked passage, opened into a cave that housed a one-way portal to the Abyss . On all but the night of a new moon , only tanar'ri could enter this portal .</p>
<p>The rocky surface at its bottom, seen by very few Ravenians, was exceedingly wet, slippery and covered in both algae and a constant thick mist. This mist billowed upwards, thinning out at 150 feet (46 meters) above the ground, though on some days it could rise as high as 200 feet (61 meters), to the very top of the cliff. The bottom of the falls were aptly named Bottomless Lake , as its bottom was not easily visible. In reality its depth was no more than 20 feet (6.1 meters), but beneath it lay a portal to the Elemental Plane of Water .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This waterfall was situated at a cliff known as Lemming's Leap , among the hills east of the Uptown District neighborhoods Mortonbrace and Skymbles , behind the city's coliseum .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point in the 14 th century DR , a bard attempted to explore the cave behind the falls and therein met his demise. The bard left behind a mist tent , hovering invisibly 10 feet (3 meters) above the cave's entrance, and it would remain there for several years. Several years later, a nabassu moved into the cave and over the next year would go on a discrete murder spree in Ravens Bluff . Feeling its time on Prime Material was finished and anxious to return home to the Abyss, the nabassu decided to set about getting its hands on the Holy Container of Wisdom , a lost Tempuran relic that it had learned the whereabouts of. It believed this sacred silver teapot be nothing more than a variant iron flask , a magical item that would be a great boon to its campaigns of terror. Ever cautious, the nabassu sent out his ghast minions to retrieve the object, disguising both them and itself with dust of illusion to appear as no more than human brigands.</p>
<p>That day a group of wandering adventurers witnessed Sir FM Lillywhite , an elven rogue paid and coerced by the nabassu to masquerade as a noble, being accosted by the faux brigands. The disguised nabassu than fled from the scene holding a reproduction of the teapot. When questioned as to what had occurred, FM Lillywhite explained to the adventurers that the teapot contained his soul and implored them to retrieve it. The adventurers chased after the nabassu, who was leading them to the ruins of a small tower within the city walls, wherein the real Holy Container of Wisdom was being guarded by Field Surgeon Kantor and three warriors of Tempus . Rather than engaging them in combat, the adventurers explained why they wanted the teapot. Kantor then agreed to go with the adventurers to confront FM Lillywhite and his heretical claims of the Holy Container housing his soul, bringing along with him the relic after having cast weighty chest upon it.</p>
<p>This confrontation went down at the Trende Cafe , where a feigning illness Lillywhite tried to offer all manner of valuables in exchange for the teapot – initially 60 platinum pieces and six air spores , then eventually throwing in an everbountiful soup kettle and jar of preserving out of desperation. Meanwhile, Kantor was fuming and outraged, cursing Lillywhite and trying to provoke him into a fight. The Field Surgeon's volatile behavior in such a public venue resulted in the adventurers having to restrain him. Sargent Katon "Bloodletter" Krag then burst into the restaurant with a booming voice, even more frothing furious then Kantor had been, casting prayer and demanding to know what was going on. Kantor tried to quickly explain, but Krag resorted to casting zone of truth . Sources differ on whether Lillywhite managed to sneak away with the real teapot or was publicly stripped and chained up by Krag. In the former case, Krag shouted at the adventurers to recover the Holy Container of Wisdom or face death. In the latter case, Krag asked them to help in verifying rumors of a tanar'ri in the area. Regardless of whichever way it went down, sources agree that Krag then lead the party to the Ravens Bluff waterfall.</p>
<p>Over the deafening roar of the falls, Krag shouted, "Trust in Tempus, just leap over the edge here, and he will guide you to your destiny!" , having foreknowledge of a hidden ledge. Field Surgeon Kantor and Rictor of the Cracked Tusk leapt first, then followed by Rictor's friends Long Time Running and Niblik , and then the adventurer Cateyes was forcefully shoved off the cliff – later recounts of this story by the Tempurans would say they were pushed "by the holy word of Tempus". Down they went, at last confronting the horrid nabassu and its ghast victims. These events were later commemorated on the cliffs atop the falls with a special, albeit small, plague.</p>
<p>Around the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , during the Three Women War , the magics of the Ministry of Art somehow interfered with the portal at the base of the waterfall.</p>
