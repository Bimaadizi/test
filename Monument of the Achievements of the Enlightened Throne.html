<p>Grand Caliph Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir commissioned this extravagant project to honor his forebears. A special group of dwarves and ogres , led by a skilled architect genie , were used to build the structure. Artists were used to decorate the walls with historic scenes of the various accomplishments of the Grand Caliphs. Naturally, the current Grand Caliph gave more attention to his father's and grandfather's deeds.</p>
<p>The project was still under construction as of 1367 DR with the hopes that it would be completed for the Grand Caliph's next Ascension Day .</p>
