<p>The shrine of Tempus in the town of Thunderstone in Cormyr in the late 1360s DR was dedicated to Tempus , god of battle.</p>
<p>It was tended by Battle Chaplain Saerlia Ashley . She inspired attending adventurers and Purple Dragons soldiers with sermons of battle, blood, and fire. She offered her healing only to those wounded in battle, and would confirm the truth of a tale before she started.</p>
<p>The shrine was a stone building decorated all over with the detritus of war: split helms, broken shields, blood-stained armor, shattered swords, and the skulls of the fallen.</p>
