<p>Jiyyd was a waymeet and trade center in Narfell on the Long Road .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The site lay in central Narfell where the northern route from Peltarch met the Long Road. It lay just west of N'Jast .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Jiyyd's position as a crossroads between the Long Road and Peltarch made it a major site of trade and barter between the Nars and foreigners. The occasional goblin tribe would also come to Jiyyd for trade.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , Jiyyd was little more than an informal campsite at the junction of two wide roads, although it was one of the more commonly used campgrounds in Narfell owing to its location on the Long Road.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, it had grown into a permanent village of hide tends and stone huts. It was known as the first civilized stop along the Long Road road in Narfell for travelers from Damara .</p>
