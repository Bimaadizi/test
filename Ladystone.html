<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Ladystone was a finger or needle of rock standing in the center of the Dancing Dell . It was about breast-high to Qilué Veladorn , and had sides rough enough to draw blood, though long millenia of worship had ground out some of the roughness.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Ladystone was part of the defenses of the Dancing Dell. It could strike as commanded by the priestesses. Eilistraeean priestesses could meditate upon it to commune with the Dancing Lady.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The origin of the Ladystone was unknown, but it was believed to date back to the earliest settlements of Ardeep . It was sacred to worshippers of Eilistraee , and it was said to have been touched by the goddess herself.</p>
<p>The wizard Tanarthil of the Towers made his way into the Dancing Dell at some point during a rite; after thwarting his spells, Qilué Veladorn urged her fellow priestesses not to chase after the man upon his departure. They were reticent to heed him, listening only after the Ladystone displayed the sign of Mystra .</p>
