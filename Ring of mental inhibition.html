<p>Rings of mental inhibition were simple enchanted rings that were created sometime long before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The gemstone inlaid in the ring's band displayed swirling metallic patterns that could leave an observer dizzy and lightheaded. This effect enhanced the wearer's spells , making targets who failed to resist spell effects feel mental fatigue for twelve seconds, making them vulnerable to spells and effects that affected their mental capacities.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a ring of mental inhibition could be found in a locked chest among spoils and ruins of the battlefield on the outskirts of the town of Reithwin , left behind from the final battle between the Harper forces and the cultists of General Ketheric Thorm in the late 14 th century DR.</p>
