<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1459 DR , Ironbark and two other treants were captured by the dracolich Dretchroyaster , who considered them a delicacy. In time, the dracolich slowly drained them of their life force.</p>
<p>By 1479 DR , only a half-mad Ironbark was still alive. That year, some adventurers infiltrated the lair and met the treant.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
