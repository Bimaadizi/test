<p>Tattoos were common bodily decorations that varied wildly in appearance and use. Some were used to accentuate one's beauty according to the local custom, while others indicated one's rank and served as a form of identification. Tattoos could hold religious significance or could be used to imbue one's body with magic . The art of tattooing was a valued skill. The process consisted of using a sharp utensil to inject ink underneath the skin's surface, forming permanent intricate decorations. Colorful tattoos were treated with oils to keep them bright and vibrant. Some experts in subterfuge and disguise created skin- glued press-on fake gauze tattoos.</p>
<p>Mundane tattoos commonly adorned the skin of sailors, pirates, and mariners, including seafaring elves of Evermeet . Criminal underbellies of big cities like Waterdeep often decorated their skin with gang insignias, tattoos, and scars. Many " Zurchins ", as Zazesspur 's street urchins were called, had their faces tattooed or branded after incarceration for ease of identification, as they were not actually children, but adult halfling thieves.</p>
<p>Decorative henna bodypainting was commonplace south and east from the Vilhon Reach as an alternative to permanent tattoos.</p>
<h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
<h3>Kara-Tur and Shou Lung</h3>
<p>Tattoos were commonly used as a form of identification across many regions of Kara-Tur . Members of various factions could be distinguished by the symbols tattooed on their arms. Warriors of Shin So Tang 's clan in the Ausa Province bore an image of a green dragon on their left arms.</p>
<p>Sprawling intricate tattoos that covered significant parts of bodies were a staple among members of yakuza clans in Kara-Tur. These tattoos covered the arms, chests, and backs of the yakuza and usually were hidden from sight, only showing small glimpses when surrounded by family. Among the heavily tattooed yakuza clans were the Bakshi of Ojy-do , while the yakuza family from Pan marked their affiliates with a small tattoo of a blue feather on the person's heel. Ninja clans of Kara-Tur used identifying tattoos as well: the Yamaguchi clan's symbol was a small flaming knife, while the Amida Butsu clan's symbol were linked red circles under their left arms.</p>
<p>In Shou Lung , members of the pirate organization called the Yellow Lizards of Keeling were rewarded with a tattoo of a yellow crane on their right arm upon joining. This was due to tattoos being considered a lower-class marking, often worn by servants. Even though many Shou secret organizations used tattoos to indicate membership, most citizens kept them hidden.</p>
<h3>Stout Folk</h3>
<p>Tattoos had a place in dwarven society. Messengers of the Stout Folk bore a small tattoo of a circle inside a circle on the bottom of their throats. Tattoos also had a practical use. Both male and female dwarves had significant amounts of body hair. Some chose to treat unwanted hair with a special paste concocted out of secret ingredients, followed by searing the area with flames in order to inhibit the growth. Tattoos were used for a similar purpose.</p>
<p>Among the gray dwarves , bright yellow tattoos in Dethek were placed on the foreheads of criminals, who were exiled from duergar communities under the threat of execution. These tattoos were more permanent than others. The Dethek runes were carved deep into their faces, so the scars were almost impossible to cover up by makeup , face masks of ash, or disguise kit paints.</p>
<p>Tattoos were believed to be common among the wild dwarves , reputed to be bloodthirsty savages, even though that reputation was likely an exaggeration. The Chultan wild dwarves tattooed their bodies in extensive brightly colored patterns.</p>
<p>The diminutive korobokuru from Kara-Tur were considered to be dirty and unsightly. Korobokuru females decorated their faces and hands with beautiful blue tattoos. Other races and cultures often considered these tattoos quite hideous.</p>
<h3>Tel-Quessir</h3>
<p>Among the elves , tattooing was most commonly seen among wild elves , or Sy'Tel'Quessir, the least organized and most primitive nomadic elven culture. These tattoos often included images of their totem animals and spirit guides. Elven society, however, mastered arts and that included the art of tattooing. Among all cultures, elven tattoos were considered the most intricate, delicate, and precise, with the wild elves' being the most proficient among the Tel-Quessir. Elven designs varied greatly and were only limited by the available space. Clan markings, magic glyphs, and even camouflage patterns were common. The most impressive tattoos were imbued with magics that allowed images of animals to move and appear alive on the recipient's skin. Curiously enough, elves, especially those of ancient Myth Drannor , preferred to use skin for their art instead of canvas due to elven longevity and the relatively quick decay of paintings and other similar types of art.</p>
<p>The Akh'Velahr of the City of Song used tattooing to indicate an individual's rank. Unlike members of other races, elves believed that military service was forever and the height of dedication to the Tel-Quessir. Hence the marks were permanent tattoos that were applied to the skin of armathors, akh'faern, and akh'velahrn. These designs were small and simple black tattoos on the backs of their hands. As they progressed up along the service titles, designs were added to the tattoos. The variety of the rank tattoos was great to reflect the complexity and a sheer number of elven military ranks. The simplest and lowest rank tattoo was a sword sigil. Officers received blue detailing on the sword tattoo with additional rings added to the officer's palm to indicate various rank permutations. For the kérym rank, additional green detailed outlines were added, and palm rings received silvery ink details. The rank of the Arms-Major was indicated by the sword tattoo receiving additional silver detailing. Akh'Faerna received tattoos of black lightning, and as they rose in ranks, azure lines wrapped around their forearms. Armathors received large black seven-pointed star tattoos. Furthermore, "medals" of service among the elves were another form of a tattoo. Bladesingers , an elite elven group of wizards who used ancient magics and blades in battle, often tattooed their bodies with ancient arcane runes.</p>
<p>In the drow society of the Underdark , it was almost unheard of for women to bear tattoos, while males, especially male warriors, were known to have decorative and enchanted facial tattoos. Namely, the Dragon's Hoard , a mercenary group that worshiped Vhaeraun .</p>
<h3>Thay</h3>
<p>The passion for the art of tattooing was extremely widespread, especially among the Red Wizards of Thay . These spellcasters bore both mundane decorative and magical tattoos. Mulan humans were the primary ethnic group ruling Thay, and they most often had shaved heads decorated with intricate designs. Rashemaar inhabitants of Thay often imitated that custom. Shaved scalps was what differentiated Thayans from the slaves, who wore their hair long. Red Wizards, and those who were pretending to be Red Wizards, always had shaved heads unless on a mission outside the country. Their shaved heads were tattooed with elaborate designs that sometimes included symbols of their favorite gods and incorporated the preferred symbol of the Red Wizards—red flames. Thayans of poorer standing used paints and makeup to draw temporary designs on their shaved heads. However, it was more common among Thayan women to avoid permanent tattoos on their heads. Instead, they frequented shops to have their scalps painted with new fashionable symbols, The same also applied to some men. Some powerful Thayan Red Wizards and Zulkirs liked to tattoo their servants; these brands could be as simple as an image of a thorny vine around their necks, which was the symbol of Zulkir Maligor .</p>
<p>The Thayan port city of Bezantur reportedly had the best tattoo artists in all the Realms. The popularity of the art of tattooing was so widespread in Bezantur that many of its inns had talented tattooists on staff. Popular designs included visually complex knotworks inspired by the Ffolk , intricate geometries from Semphar , and depictions of dragons , phoenixes , and creatures of Kara-Tur . Others also decorated their scalps to indicate the deities they worshiped. Some of these designs were imbued with minor magics allowing the designs to move.</p>
<h3>Zakhara, the Land of Fate</h3>
<p>Purity was a virtue of great value in the Land of Fate. Many human and non-human Zakharan women wore veils, exposing little of their bodies to casual observers. As such, eyes, hands, and feet were objects of beauty in Zakhara , to be decorated. Women sometimes chose to tattoo their foreheads with simple designs appealing to the eye. Tribeswomen of Al-Badia valued vanity with tattooing being the height of bodily decoration. They often tattooed not just their foreheads but also cheeks, chest, calves, hands, and feet. Tattoos were visually pleasing patterns of lines, cross marks, and dots, with each tribe preferring a design unique to them.</p>
<p>Mamluks of Zakhara wore their military ranks and organization affiliations tattooed on their faces. They often consisted of lines, patterns on their cheeks, and circles. The more status and power they had, the more sophisticated the tattoos were. Imitating or faking these tattoos was a grave offense in the mamluk society. Mamluks who were disgraced or committed severe crimes had their facial tattoos forcefully and painfully removed with pumice brushes. Veils were not allowed in the Mamluk slave-soldier society as they obscured the facial tattoos. Recently created undead Zakharan crypt servants often wore their mamluk face tattoos.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR an evil cabal that included sorceress Cassana, lich Zrie Prakis , demonic creature Phalse , the ancient god of rot Moander , and the Fire Knives assassins created the first azure bonds and used them to control their tool, a construct who later became the hero known as Alias . The woman bore the curse of the azure bonds that forced her to attempt to murder King Azoun Obarskyr IV of Cormyr . Eventually, aided by a group of friends, Alias and her "brother" Dragonbait broke the curse, leaving a beautiful azure tattoo of a rose and thorn vines on her arm. Several months later, the magics creating the azure bonds were recovered and replicated by the New Alliance of the Bonds, financed by the dreaded Fire Knives, aided by the Survivors of Moander , the remnants of the rotting god's cult, the Zhentarim , the Red Wizard of Thay Dracandros the Mad, and Tyranthraxus the Possessing Spirit. As of late 14 th century DR, Zhentarim and possibly other criminal cabals used the azure bonds for their nefarious schemes.</p>
<p>In Hammer of the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , Iriaebor in the Western Heartlands became afflicted by the Spotted Plague that took the lives of twenty people before being contained by the city's priests. The investigation concluded that the disease was of magical nature and likely was connected to heavily tattooed Talonite worshipers that passed the city shortly before the outbreak. An outbreak of featherlung eventually led to a panic in the city of Procampur . There, a woman who claimed to be a sailor with facial tattoos was accused of being a plague-spreading Talonite and was killed by a mob.</p>
