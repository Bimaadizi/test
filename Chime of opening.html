<p>A chime of opening was a magic item capable of opening locks, latches, or doors by its sonic vibrations.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Typical chimes of opening were hollow mithral tubes about 1 foot (30 centimeters) long and weighing about 1 pound (450 grams).</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The user could strike a chime of opening while pointing it to an object that possessed some sort of closed opening such as a door, lid, latch, or valve, out to a range of up to 120 feet (37 meters). The chime sent out a clear tone that unlocked one of the locks keeping the object closed, or the object itself if it only had one lock.</p>
<p>The chime could even bypass certain magical effects such as hold portal or arcane lock spells . However, if the sound could not reach the object, such as if blocked by a silence spell or similar effect, it did not have any effect.</p>
<p>The chime could be used up to ten times, after which it shattered and lost its powers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1372 DR , a chime of opening could be found in one of the cluttered tables with "antiques" in Torleth's Treasures of Gillian's Hill .</p>
