<p>Wyllowwood was one of the sub-levels of the Twisted Caverns and the 5 th overall level of the dungeon complex known as Undermountain . It was a magically -created temperate forest set within naturally occurring caverns, encircled by the River of the Depths .</p>
<p>The domain was engineered by the "Mad Mage" Halaster Blackcloak , to resemble the surface world, complete with changing seasons, imported animals, and a wide-open, illusory sky that perfectly displayed the stars and the moon as they appeared over Toril . The forest of Wyllowwood specifically was the magically created home of the eccentric druid Wyllow , after whom it was named, a long-time resident of Undermountain who was once wed to one of Halaster's apprentices.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Although its appearance was hidden with magic, the chamber that enclosed Wyllowwood had a ceiling 100 feet (30 meters) high and was bordered on three sides by the River of the Depths. Illusions were placed 30 feet (9.1 meters) above the ground and replaced the cavern's walls and ceiling with the appearance of the Torillian sky, complete with flawlessly placed stars and other celestial bodies. While the illusions could not be dispelled , the true surroundings could be seen by means of true seeing or a magical item that duplicated its effects.</p>
<p>While there were no natural gusts of wind or breeze that could be felt, Wyllowwood was warm during the day, as if it was basking in the rays of the sun , and as cold as could be expected during the night. The "seasons" of Wyllowwood changed according to the Calendar of Harptos just as they did on the surface.</p>
<h3>Forest</h3>
<p>The beaches of the River of the Depths were quite narrow and comprised small stones and pebbles. The trees nearest its waters were among the largest in Wyllowwood, with their tangled branches forming a thick canopy that extended beyond the water's edge.</p>
<p>The forest of Wyllowwood was a lush and inviting locale, seemingly completely out of place within the surrounding tunnels and caves of Undermountain. It had at least two canopies, the larger of which stood over 80 feet (24 meters) tall. The second, somewhat smaller canopy was more dense however, comprising a mix of both deciduous and coniferous species of temperate trees. Fruiting bushes, shrubs, and flowering plants could be commonly found. Roses were notably exempted from this selection as their presence displeased Wyllow.</p>
<p>The forest floor was sporadically littered with rusted weapons, damaged armor, empty bottles , and other items that had been left by adventurers that had journeyed through, and occasionally died within, Wyllowwood. For every humanoid that was killed by Wyllow's hands, she crafted a small, totemic doll and hung it from the branches of one of her trees.</p>
<h3>Caverns</h3>
<p>Beyond the forest was a series of natural caverns, dotted with a series of chambers and a few scattered stone buildings. Large portions of these caves were considered dead-magic zones , where spells and spell-like abilities ceased to function.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<h3>Entrances</h3>
<p>During the 14 th century DR , a number of ways to enter Wyllowwood existed, although none were immediately apparent:</p>
<p>Following the Second Sundering , a number of other entrances to Wyllowwood opened up:</p>
<h3>Notable Locations</h3>
<p>Built atop a great willow tree, in the northern reaches of Wyllow's forest, was a thatched hut that served as the home of the wizard -mercenary Crissann . Her abode was protected by over a half-dozen ogres that patrolled the lands beneath the willow tree.</p>
<h3>Exits</h3>
<p>The following passageways led down to the deeper levels of Undermountain:</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<h3>Creatures</h3>
<p>Several natural and magical creatures lived within the forest of Wyllowwood; many of them, along with a great number of trees, had been awakened by magic and granted sentient intelligence. Among these species were naturally occurring creatures like boars , porcupines, warthogs , skunks, black and brown bears , and elks as well as giant wasps and giant bats .</p>
<p>However, it also served as home to colonies of goblin werebats, umber hulks, groups of cohabiting ettercaps and giant spiders , basilisks , will-o'-wisps , bi-nou , and cloakers . A group of minotaurs formed their lair within one of Wyllowwood's caverns that was considered a dead-magic area.</p>
<p>A number of fungi and undead creatures dwelled within the caverns of Wyllowwood beyond the forest proper. Stone puddings , death molds , brown molds , and heucuva made their home in the more barren areas of this level of Undermountain.</p>
<h3>Aquatic Life</h3>
<p>The portion of the River of the Depths that passed through Wyllowwood was rich with sea life, including a number of lemon fishes , schools of wattley fish , and even water beetles .</p>
<p>A group of freshwater scrags also made their home beneath the River of the Depths and stored their cache of quartz , sardonyx , and other valuable gemstones in the waters beneath the Platform of Doom. A coven of sea hags ventured into Undermountain in the 14 th century and lived upon the subterranean river bed and managed to survive encounters with several of Halaster's apprentices, though they lost their magical gaze at the hands of Arcturia.</p>
<h3>Followers of Malar</h3>
<p>Wyllowwood attracted many worshipers of the deity Malar during the 14 th century DR , as the subterranean forest was quite private. They conducted their High Hunts within its woods and the winner was determined by whomever collected the most shields and skulls within a single month. While Wyllow originally allowed them to hunt within her domain, they abused this privilege and were turned away by the druid and her draconic ally.</p>
<h3>Dragon</h3>
<p>This ally was Valdemar, a young green dragon that originally encountered Wyllow under antagonistic circumstances. Upon discovering Valdemar within her domain, the elven druid contacted a band of adventurers to combat the beast and turn it away. During the battle, Valdemar received a nearly-lethal injury by means of an intelligent sword that greatly changed their perspective and caused a shift in their general alignment . Following this event, Wyllow reconsidered the relationship she could have had with Valdemar and found a place for it within Wyllowwood's ecosystem, and thereafter the two enjoyed a peaceful and mutually beneficial coexistence.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before it was known as Wyllowwood, the caverns of this domain were partly inhabited by a group of Talosian priests, who established their temple on a small island. When Halaster's apprentices came to this level they leveled the followers of the Destroyer and the temple was abandoned. All that remained was the undead horde the zealous clerics had raised in an effort to increase their power. Afterwards, Arcturia briefly considered making it her new home, though she eventually reconsidered.</p>
<p>Sometime during the 13 th century, Halaster's apprentice Yinark met the moon elf Wyllow while he was away from Undermountain. The two fell in love and they joyously returned together to Yinark's home, deep beneath the city of Waterdeep. However, Wyllow was crestfallen when she saw that the dungeon that her beloved called home was so vastly different from the woods she called home. Determined to keep Yinark and his new love content, and prevent them from leaving Undermountain, Halaster used multiple castings of the spell wish to create Wyllowwood—a subterranean domain of nature, named after and crafted for a single individual.</p>
<p>At some point, a group of adventurers ventured into Wyllowwood and were ambushed by Yinark. One of these travelers was a warrior who carried with them the emerald blade called Tearulai . Halaster's apprentice managed to slay all bar two of the interlopers but the act of violence set him upon a path of increasingly evil disposition. The story of this battle and the subsequent hiding of the sword by Halaster himself was inscribed into a large stone that sat in a clearing northwest of Wyllow's Tower.</p>
<p>However grand as Wyllowwood was, its serene environment was not enough to ease Yinark's obsession and Wyllow's growing lethargy. Eventually Wyllow became quite close with her friend Crissann, a human wizardess who lived as a mercenary, and the two seemed to form a budding romance. Before they could explore a life as lovers, however, Halaster interceded and turned Crissann against Wyllow in an effort to assuage Yinark's jealousy. Wyllow slew her former friend with the aid of the creatures of her forest and swore to never let another living being sway her heart.</p>
<p>Eventually, Yinark outright forbade Wyllow from returning to her home on the surface and she was completely overwhelmed with despair. Their relationship had become so acrimonious, this final act led to a violent outburst and the two fought each other in a vicious spell-battle. Wyllow slew her former husband. As she was left completely despondent and wracked with guilt, with no love left in her life, Wyllow remained within her domain as per Yinark's final wishes.</p>
<p>During the early 14 th century, the elf Sirane went to drink some water in Heroes' Garden when she was accidentally transported to Undermountain. She was confronted by Arcturia and turned to stone. Her petrified form was taken to Wyllowwood, where it remained for at least 40 years.</p>
