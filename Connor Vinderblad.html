<p>Connor died in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , leaving his wife alone and childless, with no money to her name. Desperate to bring Connor back from the dead, Mayrina lugged his lifeless body to the home of Auntie Ethel in the Sunlit Wetlands and offered their unborn child for his return.</p>
