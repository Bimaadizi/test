<h2>History</h2>
<p>Weimin Min died many moons before the late 14 th century DR. In life, he was one of six trusted lieutenants who served Nan Kung Chi and continued to do the same after death. In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the crypt faced an illithid incursion led by Goxxa the alhoon . The mind flayers consumed ancient preserved minds of the crypt's dead and sought the Claw of the Black Leopard . At the same time, a vampire thief named Hexxat arrived at the tomb on the behest of her master Larloch , who sought the tomb's magical treasure. A ghostly monk named Ki Chin Sang stood guard of Nan Kung Chi's tomb and demanded anyone seeking entrance to defeat six of Nan Kung Chi's trusted undead lieutenants who all were interred together. When Hexxat and her allies challenged the lieutenants to battle, Weimin Min was joined by Yi Niu , Borok-Tosst , Ming-hua Dai , and Jiang Dai , and, presumably, was defeated.</p>
