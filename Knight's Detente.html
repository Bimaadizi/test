<p>The Knight's Detente was a boisterous festhall with rooms for rent in Eshpurta in early 1370 DR, the Year of the Tankard .</p>
<p>It was a place for soldiers to carouse, flirt, gamble, laugh, and spend their pay on poor quality but overpriced food and drink. Non-military were not welcome, although it was said that a person could gain entrance if they could last more than five seconds arm-wrestling the burly half-orc bouncer, Xom .</p>
