<p>Storm bells , also called storm gongs , were easily the largest musical instruments throughout Zakhara .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These massive metal cylinders and plates were struck with large pieces of wood wrapped in protective cloth. Some storm bells were small enough to be carried in a cart pulled by oxen, but others were so large that they were permanent fixtures on buildings.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Though the modern cities of Zakhara used these items to draw crowds to important events or announcements, the historical purpose of a storm bell was to announce the coming of a deadly sandstorm out in the open desert. The sound of a storm bell rung clearly for miles, granting the desert tribes plenty of warning before an approaching sandstorm.</p>
<p>Storm bells were also positioned along cliffs surrounding particularly deadly reefs to warn sailors of treacherous water.</p>
