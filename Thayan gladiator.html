<p>Thayan Gladiators were monstrous humanoids trained to fight in the arenas of Thay . They were awe-inspiring combatants that played an important part in Thayan culture, and the ever-present sociopolitical dynamics.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Thayan Gladiators were in heavy demand from the elite upper class of Thay, serving as a distraction from the day to day hardship and torment that arises from living in the realm of the Red Wizards . This demand for excellence and amusement gave the Thayan gladiators a tradition that made them the very best of their kind throughout the Realms .</p>
<p>They were often used as political pawns by their Thayan masters. Gladitorial matches could settle disagreements and even allow Thayan aristocrats to gain or lose favor with their masters.</p>
<p>The most powerful Gladiators found themselves as potential guards for Red Wizards or even the tharchions . They were thought of as among the most loyal and ferocious protectors in Faer√ªn . A select few were either freed from, or escaped from their service and often took on the adventuring lifestyle.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Not all gladiators fought alone, some were granted the boon of fighting alongside an ally in certain matches.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Gladiators were experts at observing their opponents' movements and actions in combat. This skill granted them a a definite edge in a battle.</p>
<p>Once they designated as a gladiator, the natural weapons of the monstrous creatures were enhanced by magical means. They could be altered to inflict the same damage as weapons coated with silver , or for the more veteran gladiators, adamantine .</p>
<p>Gladiators' claws and horns could even be imbued with certain magical properties, such magical enchantment , and power to burst into flames , emanate coldness , harm incorporeal creatures , conduct harmful levels of electricity , or emit booming noise .</p>
<p>The magical alteration developed further as gladiators continued to fight in the Thayan combat rings. After more time, their natural weapons could even be made to deliver quick strikes ; inflict great blood loss ; burst with flames , ice , or electricity ; further harm beings of law and chaos ; destroy undead beings; or inflict drain the life force from the living.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The 14 th century merchant Varouk Pital treated his gladiators with some level of care. If they proved themselves as worthy in the arena, Varouk would offer them freedom and employment with his treasure-hunting expeditions.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>Thayan Gladiators are all monstrous humanoids who possessed natural weapons such as claws or horns. Among the various races whose members were abducted for the ranks of the gladiators were minotaurs and lizardfolk native to Thay, wemics and gnolls from the plains of the Shaar , and yuan-ti that were taken from the far off jungles of Chult .</p>
<p>Upon becoming admittance into the gladiators, they were presented to a Red Wizard of transmutation , who began the process of adding magical enhancements to one of the gladiator's natural weapons.</p>
