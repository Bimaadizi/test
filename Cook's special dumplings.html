<p>Cook's special dumplings were a culinary creation of Geldorf "The Cook" Tinbasher , a stern dwarven chef from Thay , active in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cook's special dumplings were hand-shaped savory little morsels that exuded mouth-watering scent making it hard not to devour the entire batch. These dumplings also had more practical use, especially helpful for gladiators of Thay. When consumed before battle, each dumpling invigorated the eater, giving them an upper hand when striking their opponents.</p>
<p>Another reason not to eat an entire batch at the time - severe indigestion.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR , Geldorf Tinbasher offered the Champion of Baeloth's Pit freshly made special dumplings in exchange for a piece of the Concocter , a myconid potion maker, during the Champion's stay within the gladiatorial pits of Thay .</p>
