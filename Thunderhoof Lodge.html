<p>The Thunderhoof Lodge was a quality inn and tavern in Ormath of the Shining Plains .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point before the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Adamar Session , Bard of Starmantle , visited the Thunderhoof Lodge during his twelve-year adventuring trek across the Reach. During an afternoon of lounging in the establishment, an adventure found Adamar and his companions Dwin , Sarun , and Anathet . Across the street from the Lodge, a group of Shining Plains' militia was under attack by three hungry manticores. The adventurers rushed to help and eventually slew the leader of the three magical beasts, sending the rest fleeing. As a reward for the aid to their kin, The Thunderhoof gave Adamar and his friends free lodgings, while one of the city's elders invited adventurers to partake in the Sun Festival celebration.</p>
