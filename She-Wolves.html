<p>The She-Wolves were an all-female amazon mercenary company based in the island of Ixinos in the Vilhon Reach in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The She-Wolves had two units of infantry, one of cavalry and one of archers, each of 50 members. There were also 10 scouts, 10 sorceresses , and 20 priestesses .</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>They were a very cohesive group, able to fight on all kinds of terrain. They were also very skilled at changing tactics during a battle thanks to a rapid code.</p>
<h2>Contracts</h2>
<p>The She-Wolves never accepted work from men that looked down on women, andÂ followed a code of honor trying to help all women in need. They also acted as the army of Ixinos, and charged 500 gold pieces per week for their services.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The She-Wolves were founded circa the Year of the Wilted Flowers, 1258 DR , to allow the amazons of Ixinos to satisfy their wanderlust and earn coin for their island home.</p>
<p>On the isle of Ixinos in the Vilhon Reach lived a matriarchal human culture where women were trained as warriors from birth. Around 1258 DR , they started going outside the island and acted as a mercenary company. In time, they destroyed a large number of pirate groups in the Sea of Fallen Stars . The amazon society of Ixinos existed in seclusion from the rest of the Reach. They engaged in trade but kept it exclusive to female-captained merchant ships.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the She-Wolves Brianna Tarvison and Pahelhe Firecaster , were among the guests of Lord Partic Thistle at Thistleflame Keep in Cormyr .</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , amazons of the She-Wolves company continued to helm mercenary campaigns in the Vilhon Reach and defended the shores of Ixinos from pirate incursions.</p>
