<p>Sorenhotep I was one of the Pharaohs that reigned during the waning years of the Second Empire of Mulhorand .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Pharaoh Sorenhotep I was still a young man, he was convinced that he needed a queen of beauty greater than any other mortal woman of the Realms . The Pharaoh sent messengers to all lands, even the farthest parts of the world, in search of such a wife. One of the royal messengers returned with the story of the fey princess Serenia . Without hesitation, Sorenhotep organized a caravan to the princess's land. With a Mulhorandi diplomat as its leader, it had five-thousand soldiers, one-hundred wizards , forty bards , dozens of wagons made from gold , cages full of animals from the royal zoo, and mechanical wonders from the Mulhorandi workshopsâ€”truly a delegation to behold.</p>
<p>But Serenia was not impressed by the wonders and lavish gifts sent her way. Many kings had the same treasures to brag about. The princess informed the Mulhorandi ambassador that only one thing could win her hand in marriage: if the king could present her the fabled unicorn of Ganathwood so the princess could ride on its back to the wedding. Sorenhotep consulted his royal magicians but was informed that no one could capture the beast; it was amazingly strong and fast, besting all hunters who had ever tried. Only a fair and pure maiden could distract the creature long enough for it to be harnessed. The Pharaoh ordered the kingdom's young maidens to be gathered and sent to Ganathwood, but months passed by, and none of the Mulhorandi girls were successful.</p>
<p>Princess Serenia was surprised to see the Mulhorandi diplomat return to her court with good news: the legendary unicorn was captured, but the princess had to travel to Ganathwood, where Sorenhotep kept the beast. Serenia complied and was greeted with no man, no soldier, just the forest. It did not take long for the fabled unicorn to present itself and lay its head on the princess's lap. Suddenly, the Mulhorandi soldiers leaped from their hiding and roped the unicorn.</p>
<p>Princess Serenia was outraged by the deception at first, but eventually came to a realization that the crafty Pharaoh did just what she asked of him and simply outwitted her. She agreed to the marriage and became Queen Serenia of Mulhorand.</p>
