<p>Staff of the ram was an enchanted quarterstaff wielded by the High Harper Jaheira sometime before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Staff of the ram hummed and pulsed with energy of its powerful namesake creature contained within. It possessed a potent +2 enchantment that strengthened the weapon 's blows and aided the wielder's aim. When wielded in battle, staff of the ram could knock one opponent 7 feet (2.1 meters) back and stun them every six seconds. However, that magic left huge creatures and dragons unaffected.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jaheira's staff of the ram was created by some unknown archmage who did not leave a crafter's mark, nor any other identification on the weapon. At some point in her long adventuring life, Jaheira came across the staff and by the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , had it stashed in a small hidden sanctuary underneath her home in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate alongside other treasures of her younger days, such as a Belm from Kara-Tur and priceless Khalid's Gift .</p>
