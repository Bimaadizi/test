<p>Druxus Rhym was the Zulkir of Transmutation within the Red Wizards of Thay in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Druxus was a skinny, stork-legged man, with a weak chin and a bulge of flab at the waist-line. Tattoos covered his body.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Druxus wore many repositories of magic, such as rings, a silver-and-obsidian amulet around his neck, even the very tattoos on his body.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He had only to concentrate for his magical repositories to release their magic and bestow upon him the strength of a giant , turn his attackers to stone, or whisk himself across the realm to a place of safety.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>An ally of Szass Tam , Rhym was a major proponent of trade over isolationism in Thay in the early 1370s DR.</p>
<p>Under Druxus Rhym's leadership, Thayan enclaves across the Realms were selling amulets of resistance , making them common items circa 1372 DR . These amulets were relatively cheap to make and provided the Red Wizards with a significant source of profit.</p>
<p>Despite his magical prowess, Rhym was assassinated on Mirtul 5 in the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR , by an unknown assailant in his own bedroom. His replacement as Zulkir was Samas Kul .</p>
