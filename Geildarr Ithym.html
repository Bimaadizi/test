<p>Geildarr Ithym was a human mage who was the Lord Mayor of Llorkh in the Savage Frontier and a member of the Zhentarim in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Shortly before 1357 DR , Lord Phintarn "Redblade" of Llorkh was found dead. Overnight, Geildarr seized the Lord's Keep , claimed the throne, and assumed the title of "Lord". Soon after, Geildarr's " Lord's Men " invaded the city and slaughtered the existing militia. Thus Llorkh was quickly conquered by the Zhentarim and under the control of their puppet.</p>
<p>Thanks to this brutal occupation, the townsfolk had no liking for Lord Geildarr. He named the aged dwarf cleric Thianos "Ironskull" an outlaw and ordered his troops to find him.</p>
<p>However, in autumn of the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , after the Zhentarim armies were defeated in the Battle of Ascore , a dwarf rebellion broke out in Llorkh. Jarbarkas , who joined the Waterdhavian volunteer force aiding the resistance, was captured after a Zhentarim ambush. Despite being interrogated by Geildarr, Jarbarkas refused to divulge information, so Geildarr animated a giant skeleton to kill the prisoner, but he was saved by the Heroes of Ascore and the dwarven resistance force. The Heroes proceeded to enter the Lord's Keep , defeating Geildarr and his female companion Cortarra to rescue Jarbarkas and Siulajia .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Geildarr ruled Llorkh as Lord from 1357 DR onward, through the 1360s and early 1370s DR. By 1372 DR , he was titled Lord Mayor.</p>
<p>As Llorkh prospered on Zhentish caravans, Geildarr grew very, very rich, multiplying his fortune several times. He used some of his wealth to hire adventurers to explore the Greypeak Mountains , particularly to loot Netherese ruins. He sought lost magic that would either improve his status among the Zhentarim or boost the strength of his army. He hastened to turn Llorkh into a Zhentish stronghold, having his Zhentilar and Lord's Men build defenses. His ultimate goal was to dominate trade routes across the North and up and down the Sword Coast North . To this end, the town of Llorkh had been selected as the Zhentarim's foothold in the North, thanks to its distance from the rival powers of Silverymoon and Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Ostensibly, Geildarr was advised by the priest Mythkar Leng . In truth, Mythkar was his superior and he kept Geildarr in line and pursuing the Zhentarim's plans for the North. In this, Mythkar was aided by the beholder Rakaxalorth .</p>
<p>Geildarr commanded both the Zhentilar soldiers that frequented the town and the army of four hundred, purple-cloaked Lord's Men that "protected" the city from those who did not appreciate the rule of the Black Network. The Lord's Men enforced Geildarr's will and protected the unpopular lord against adventurers and insurgent townsfolk.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>A man of high intellect and charisma but little wisdom, Geildarr was still a young and ambitious Zhentarim mageling by the mid-1360s DR. He had the grand aspiration of commanding the whole Black Network one day.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Around 1357 DR, it was furtively rumored in Llorkh that Lord Geildarr was a member of the Zhentarim. This was in fact completely true and all doubt was erased with the overt Zhentish dominance by 1372 DR.</p>
<p>Lord Geildarr was uncertain if the name of the Wet Wizard tavern was a mocking reference to him or not.</p>
