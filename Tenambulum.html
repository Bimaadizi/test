<p>Tenambulum was a mage that had a reputation as a demon -catcher. He was a courtly advisor to the Zarovich family.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was relatively little known that Tenambulum's timely aid allowed the Zarovich family to survive when they were displaced from their ancestral lands. He was more famous for his skills as a demon-catcher, and especially as a spellsmith who created such items as the band of spell enhancement to better leverage his impressive arcane abilities.</p>
<p>Their library in Laothkund was pilfered by the rogue Gage in 1374Â DR , who took the Hands of Paymon .</p>
