<p>Lendon's Dike , also called Lendon's Wall , was an earthen berm that spanned the width of the Winterspear Vale as of the early 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Dike was an earthen wall meant to defend the Vale from invaders from the north. A ditch was dug along the northern side to make the fortification a greater barrier and a row of straight trees marked the top of the berm. The Vale Road passed through a gap in the Dike.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Dike was located about 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) north of Hulburg along the Winterspear River . It spanned a mile and a half (2.4 kilometers) across the Winterspear Vale on the eastern side of the river. The Dike's western end was anchored at Lake Hul and its eastern end was anchored against the steep hills of the Highfells on the Vale's eastern edge. Open farmland marked both sides of the wall.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Dike was raised in the early 15 th century DR by Lendon Hulmaster of Hulburg. It was intended to provide a defensible location to repel orc raids in the Winterspear Vale, but fell out of use in the mid–15 th century DR when orc raids became less frequent. The structure subsequently became overgrown with grasses, brambles, and small trees.</p>
<p>When the Bloody Skull orcs and their allies marched on Hulburg from Thar in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the Hulburgians made a last stand at the old dike. They worked tirelessly through the night of Tarsakh 11 to fortify the earthworks, felling trees and clearing brambles on the southern side to create barriers on the northern side. They ultimately met the orc horde in the Battle of Lendon's Dike , and emerged victorious on Tarsakh 12 .</p>
