<p>Ironhand's Reckoning was an enchanted greatsword from the Moonshae Isles that helped the wielder strike and harm any kind of giant .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The greatsword was phenomenally decorated. By the late 15 th century DR , the blade was covered in nicks and flaws, but this did not impact its superb balance. The pained rumblings of slain giants could be heard when holding the weapon.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>In addition to bearing a powerful baseline enchantment, Ironhand's reckoning had been imbued with Northlander magics that made it particularly devastating to larger foes as well as separate powers that made it even more deadly to giants and giant-kin specifically.</p>
<p>Beyond these enchantments, it also had the power to rally the wielder's allies in battle against giant foes, as well as to heal the wielder upon successfully slaying such foes. These additional powers only functioned in combat against giants and large humanoids .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The weapon was crafted on the orders of King Thelgaar Ironhand of Oman prior to the unification of the Moonshae Isles in the 14 th century DR. Upon uniting the bickering Northlanders under his banner, he recognized that the greatest threat to his reign and ambitions came from the giants of the Grampalt Highlands who raided his people. He thus had his weaponsmith craft him a greatsword that his magic-users imbued with mighty giantslaying powers. The king then wielded the blade personally in battle, leading his soldiers to name the sword "Ironhand's Reckoning".</p>
<p>Replicas of this weapon were crafted by the same blacksmith who forged the original, but none were as powerful as the true Ironhand's Reckoning . The replicas were given to Helgaar's loyal followers, and found their ways across the Moonshae Isles over the following century.</p>
