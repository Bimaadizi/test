<h2>Description</h2>

Most of the vales were barren and hosted dens and holdfasts of orcs and giants .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The mountains covered the southern tip of Moray. They were bordered on the east by the Strait of the Leviathan , and by the Trackless Sea to the south and west. The Shannyth River flowed north from the center of the Orcskull Mountains into central Moray.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>While at one time the upland meadows were home to Northlander farmers and ranchers famed for raising long-haired cattle , by the late 15 th century DR , the mountains were ruled by various tribes of orcs, ogres , giants, and other monstrous humanoids .</p>
