<p>Shadow spiders were enormous spiders from the Shadowfell who hunted for prey on the Prime Material plane .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These shadowy arachnids were roughly 2.5 feet (0.76 meters) tall while their bodies were typically 5 feet (1.5 meters) in diameter. They had eight eyes, which were dark red nearing black in color.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Shadow spiders could use the spell -like ability shadow walk , allowing them to move between the Material Plane and the Shadowfell at will. Their teeth were coated with paralyzing fluid. They could also spray a layer of spider silk covering up to 100 square feet (9.3 square meters) within seconds. This spidersilk was nearly identical to the effects of a grease spell.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Possessed of ample intelligence (for a spider) and cunning, shadow spiders were frightening opponents indeed. They maintained larders in small pockets of the Shadowfell. These they filled up with the corpses of their prey, only abandoning a larder for a new one once it was filled to the brim. They had no interest in treasure, preferring to leave their victims' belongings on the ground.</p>
<p>They spoke Common .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Shadow spiders used their slippery spider silk to make victims fall, for example down a set of stairs, where the spider would be lying in wait. They would then grab their victim with their claws and attempt to drag them into their Shadowfell larder. Once captured, shadow spiders would paralyze their victims and return to the Material plane to gather more prey in the immediate vicinity.</p>
<p>As creatures of the Shadowfell, they were especially susceptible to shadowscourge weapons.</p>
