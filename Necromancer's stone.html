<p>A necromancer's stone was a fist-sized black sapphire used in necromantic summonings.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Unless it was being used, it had to be covered at all times with a magical cloth. Anyone sensitive to the arcane could feel its magical emanations when it was in close proximity.</p>
<p>When uncovered, the gem would start pulsating, sending a summoning call to any undead in the area. It also helped in controlling more powerful undead, like mummies ; when that was the case, the stone started glowing with an eerie black-purple luminescence.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the imp Druzil sneaked into Barjin 's chambers, he started checking all of his belongings, among them, the necromancer's stone. The stone was used during the plan to destroy the Edificant Library , where Barjin uncovered it in the catacombs, which summoned a group of ghouls and also helped control a powerful mummy .</p>
<p>The stone was finally stolen by Druzil, who stepped into the flames of Barjin's brazier and into the Abyss , abandoning the library until Barjin had things under control.</p>
