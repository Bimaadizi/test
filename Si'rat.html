<p>Si'rat was a small and active volcanic island in the Southern Ocean , part of an archipelago known as the Island Kingdoms .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>This island was a haven for various sea birds , though it was also said to be frequented by strange spirits . These were potentially elemental creatures typically found around volcanoes, such as fire elementals , magma para-elementals , and smoke para-elementals .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the year 1088 DR , this volcano experienced an eruption. Over time, by 1357 DR plant life and birds had come back to the island. However, around that time some suspected that another eruption was possibly imminent. The severity of this next eruption was uncertain, but it would undoubtedly be preceded by an influx of creatures from the Elemental Plane of Fire and the Para-Elemental Plane of Magma .</p>
