<p>Sund was a wine made in the village and vale of Maskyr's Eye in the Vast in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>In Maskyr's Eye, vineyards were planted on the steep hillsides at the vale's eastern edge to avert erosion and landslides. However, the cold, damp weather caused them to be troubled by the blackweb blight and the grapes grew bitter and stunted. These were fermented to make sund.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the resulting wine was thin and yellow-green in hue and had a sharply sour flavor in both taste and smell, making it quite an acquired taste. Fortunately, the Maskyrians had acquired such a taste and had a small number of sund-lovers among them. Further afield, even in Calaunt it was named sheeprun after its alleged similarity to the goldflow of sheep . Nevertheless, it traveled well, so some traders and caravaneers preferred it for personal use.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Accordingly, a large skin of sun cost only 2 cp , while a barrel big enough for a man to carry would set one back 1 sp . It was sold as a beverage at The Wizard's Hand inn in Maskyr's Vale, but otherwise there was little profit to be had in trading it.</p>
