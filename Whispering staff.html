<p>Whispering staff was an enchanted goblin ironwood staff , once wielded by sorcerer Caballus .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The staff was short, carved to accommodate a goblin so that a taller humanoid would wield it as a one-handed bludgeon with ease. Whispering staff was carved with snaking runes. Most were decorative gibberish, apart from a rune of accuracy and a rune of wounding that gave the staff its powers.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Whispering staff possessed a +1 , and later, a +2 , enchantment and had a very slight chance of silencing a target upon a successful strike. Additionally, whispering staff enhanced the wielder skills to move soundlessly.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , the city of Targos laid besieged by a force of savage goblinoids of the north. A goblin sorcerer named Caballus led an assault on the town and flooded the city with raiders after magically penetrating its fortifications. Caballus wielded his whispering staff when he closed with a band of mercenaries from Luskan . Subsequently, the sorcerer was slain, and whispering staff changed owners.</p>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , the whispering staff ended up in the hands of Silvenius Crim , a dealer of magical items and an agent of the Arcane Brotherhood in the town of Targos.</p>
