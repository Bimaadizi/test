<p>Ilquog was an Iyachtu Xvim -worshiping barghest guard and a member of the Legion of the Chimera in the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , the town of Targos in Icewind Dale became besieged by the Legion of the Chimera. One of the Legion's surprise attacks involved teleporting goblins from underground tunnels into the Targos docks. The next attack came as a direct assault on the town's palisades. Lord Ulbrec Dinnesmore of Targos ordered a group of mercenaries from Luskan to follow two of his scouts, Ennelia and Braston , southeast to the goblin fortress. Vunarg and his tribe resided in the recently erected fort in the frigid Icewind Dale tundra.</p>
<p>In the cavers underneath the Legion's fortress, Ilquog stood guard of the barghest camp. The creature allowed anyone who knew the simple password "Xvim" through the barghest territory.</p>
