<p>Serôs ( SAY-ros ) was the name of the undersea realms of the Sea of Fallen Stars , the largest inland body of water in Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>The word Serôs in the merfolk language translated into the embracing life .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Surface-worlders organized the undersea lands of Serôs into six major depth zones. Each of these were distinct from one another in terms of the flora & fauna that lived there, the ambient temperature, the pressure of the ocean depths, and the amount of sunlight that penetrated through the water. Beyond the depths of 250 feet (76 meters), surface dwellers were unable to see without some external assistance or light source, nor could their bodies survive the increasing pressure of the depths beyond 300 feet (91 meters) without outside assistance, like pressure resistance .</p>
<h3>Geographic Features</h3>
<p>Situated in the in the midpoint of the Inner Sea, down at the gloom zone, was the Hmur Plateau , a large oceanic plateau that continued almost contiguously from the continental slope off the coasts. It was home to a great deal of the civilizations of Serôs, as well as undersea mountains that soared upwards to form the Pirate Isles and the Isle of Prespur . The height of the plateau considerably varied in places, generally being 100​ to ​300 feet (30​ to ​91 meters) from the surface. Its interior concealed several man-made, monster-laden tunnels, known as the Tunnels of Iratis . Some of these connected to the Underdark. To the south of the plateau lay the ever dangerous trenches.</p>
<p>At the northern end of the Hmur Plateau stood Hanalitanar Forest , a forest of crystals and hydrozoans that sprung from the wreckage of an elven armada ship that had crashed into the Inner Sea in 799 TS (729 DR) .</p>
<p>To the southwest of the Hmur Plateau lay the Selmal Basin , referred to by those on the surface as the Vilhon Reach. This arm of the Inner Sea was the cradle to Serôs's first recorded empire. The primary oceanic ridge of the undersea lands stretched from the mouth of this basin, all the way to the Mountains of Volar , what the Serôsians called the mountainous undersea portion of the Archipelago of Altumbel .</p>
<p>East of the Hmur Plateau, below in the abyssal plains, resided a portal called the Wildtide Gate that connected to the Sea of Corynactis . For most of Serôsian history this portal was intermittent, only becoming active once every 720 years, beginning in −1439 TS (−1509 DR) . But the fifth time it became active, in 1441 TS (1371 DR) , it became a permanent gate between the two seas.</p>
<p>To the southeast of the Hmur Plateau lay the Alamber Sea , which made up 30% of Serôs. Out of all the arms that comprised the Inner Sea, this body of water was both the most isolated from the rest of Serôs and most discounted by the aquatic sentients, to the point of not being considered part of Serôs proper. For 15,000 years it was walled off from the rest of Serôs by the Sharksbane Wall . a gargantuan defensive rampart comparable only to the Dragonwall of Shou Lung . Built among the Sharksteeth Mounts , a ridge of mountains that spanned the mouth of the Alamber Sea, it united a series of garrisons called the Pillars of the Trident and served to cordon off the sahuagin from the rest of Serôs. In 1439 TS (1369 DR) , the wall suffered a 2‑mile (3,200‑meter) breach. Though accounting for only 5% of the whole defensive structure, it would alter the political and territorial landscape of Serôs for years to come.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>While coral on most worlds were typically limited in their capacity for growth to a fragile ecosystem of warm, sunlit waters, the over 500 breeds of coral indigenous to Serôs were far more hardy and even capable of thriving in cold-water. They could be found all across the depths, but were most prevalent in the Alamber Sea. They grew for hundreds of miles and beyond, creating moderately sized reefs as the coral died or moved on. To the people of the surface-world, these reefs were often regarded as obstructions to their ships.</p>
<p>Other largely immobile, hardy animal life-forms, that could be found in many varieties across Serôs included hydrozoans and sponges . The former were often mistaken for plant life, referred to by some as "aquatic ferns " or as the "trees" of Serôs. There were many varieties of them that grew across the continental margins, forming so called "forests", such as Duna's Forest in eastern Serôs.</p>
<p>The Inner Sea was home to a variety of smaller sea life that fed many of the creatures of Serôs, such as plankton, krill , various types of fish, mussels , scallops , urchins , sea snakes , eels , and bottom-feeding crustaceans in the shallows zone. The latter three were considered by some aquatic sentients to be delicacies.</p>
<p>Aside from fish, one of the most basic staples of Serôsian diets was that of kelp. These sea grasses were widely cultivated, for their fast growth rate of up to 2 feet (0.61 meters) per day made them an inexhaustible supply of food. The most basic of these were aqua, blue, and green kelp. Larger cultivars of kelp grew at slower rates, but had even more applications. The annually harvests of these larger cultivars was significant to some Serôsian cultures, occurring on the songs (months) of Icesong , Eadarsong , and Eldasong , as well as minor harvests on the song of Sekolhunt .</p>
<p>Many larger creatures in the depths were utilized as beasts of burden or draft animals, most often docile pilot whales , narwhals , and sea turtles . Among the sahuagin, sharks were used for this purpose. And while giant crustaceans were considered by some to be food, they were more often than not viewed as being more valuable as draft animals. When it came to mounts , hippocampi and giant sea horses were the standard choices.</p>
<p>Besides pilot whales, over nine distinct breeds of these massive mammals plied the waters of Serôs. They could be broadly divided into two diet-based categories, the baleen and toothed. The baleen included the pilot whales, humpback whales , night whales , sapphire whales , and snow whales . Rather peaceful and more intelligent than their toothed kin, these whales strained seawater through their mouths to feed upon the miscroscopic plankton and krill. The more aggressive toothed whales subsisted upon the other large species of the deep, such as krakens and giant squids. They included beaked whales , narwhals, killer whales , the truly massive sperm whales , and potentially one of the legendary leviathans .</p>
<p>The depths were also home to a number of pearl -bearing creatures, such as giant clams & oysters , standard-sized clams & oysters , mussels, and urchins. These were commonly domesticated by the people of Serôs and cultivated in farming community "pearl beds", though some also found use for giant clams shells in the building of housing.</p>
<p>Dangerous wildlife within the waters of Serôs included the likes of ascallions , bane-stars , aquatic carrion crawlers , barracudas , crystal oozes , death minnows , manta rays , moray eels , sea lions , sting rays , and vurgens . There were also several monstrously sized breeds of mundane sea-life, like gar , pike , lampreys , sea anemones , eels, squids, and starfish .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The undersea lands of Serôs were host to a wide range of aquatic races, divided amongst its sixth depth zones.</p>
<p>Other races to be found in Serôs included anguiliians , storm giants in the Mountains of Volar, kelpies in the coastal shallows, reef giants , the enigmatic aquatic dwarves , and a small population of vodyanoi , who tunneled through Hmur Plateau. Additionally, owing to the many magical subsea gates in Serôs, many aquatic denizens of the Outer Planes found their way to the undersea realms on more than one occasion, as did water weirds and other creatures of elemental water .</p>
<p>In a move that set the Serôsians apart from surface-worlders, dolphins and whales were viewed as intelligent equals, even capable of serving within the clergies of undersea faiths. To kill and eat whales was considered by most to be a horrific offense. Only a select few evil races, such as the ixitxachitl and sahuagin, would savagely attack whale herds. And unlike the horses of the surface, the rather intelligent hippocampi would often expect to be treated as allies and friends, rather than mindless steeds.</p>
<h3>Biological Differences</h3>
<p>Much of the Serôsian populace had varying degrees of optical light-sensitivity, which influenced what times of day they could comfortably make their way up to the surface without being blinded by the sun. Among the undersea races, only the ixitxachitl, merfolk, and sea elves could easily bear bright sunlight. The next degree down were those who could only handle sunlight visible from dusk to godswake – koalinth, merrow, shalarin, and tritons. The third degree of sensitivity were those who could only handle nighttime, though even then the light of a full moon was uncomfortable to their eyes. This group included the morkoths, sahuagins, and scrags.</p>
<p>Another dividing point physiologically between the undersea races was the capacity to breath brackish waters. The vast majority of aquatic sentients could only breath salt water, which made up about 99% of the total volume of the Inner Sea. Exposure would cause them to feel unsteady and light-headed or sluggishness. Continued exposure would lead to extreme nausea and for weaker creature's potentially death. The only races that could experience water of differing salinity without suffering any ill effects were the aquatic elves, koalinth, and scrags.</p>
<h3>Notable Races</h3>
<h2>Realms</h2>
<h3>Former Realms</h3>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Amongst the more malevolent aquatic races of Serôs, raiding other communities was a common activity. This was known to be conducted by koalinth, kuo-toans, morkoth, sahuagin, seawolves, and scrags. The purposes behind raiding were varied, such as a desire for food, valuables, slaves, or as simple acts of war. In the case of morkoth and sahuagin, there were certain songs each cycle that marked the most common months for them to be engaging in raiding, these being Eldasong and Sekolhunt respectively.</p>
<h3>Calenders</h3>
<p>Over the course of Serôsian history, nearly every sentient race devised its own methods of measuring the passage of time. These methods were usually lax when it came to the specific passage of bells and such, instead focused on broad, activity-specific terms such as feeding, hunting, resting, etc. They also generally made no use of timekeeping devices like clocks, for it was seen as common knowledge that all life in Serôs attended to similar expected norms and patterned times for their activities.</p>
<p>In terms of calendars , most were solely of an oral nature, with only three prominent ones taking any written form. These were the Aryselmalyn calendar , the Calendar of Hmur , and the Timesong calendar . The first was established by the aquatic elves of Aryselmalyr, inscribed upon coral and cryscoral spindles. It fell out of use when the empire fell. The second was established by the merfolk of Hmurrath and continued to see use after that empire's fall, well into the 14 th century DR. It was used by most locathah, as well as some merfolk, though the former kept it strictly oral. The Timesong calendar was established in -69 DR by the Oghmanyte Arkallus Vordahl , who drew correlatives from various different surface-world and Serôsian calendars. The priest purposely designed it with the intent of it becoming a unifying calendar system for the various undersea races, one that they could all follow.</p>
<p>The fourth prominent calendar of Serôs, one that had also been taken into account by Arkallus when designing the Timesong calendar, was Whaletime . A purely oral tradition, it was a method of measuring the passage of time that was wholly unique to whales.</p>
<h3>Culture</h3>
<p>The undersea realms lacked taverns and inns as the surface-world understood them. While one could find a room to eat and rent for the night, there was nowhere to purchase a beverage, as the concept of "drinking" was foreign to most Serôsians. In terms of architectural style, it varied quite considerably from race to race. Most cities had their buildings laid out close to one another, so as to conserve warmth and provide another layer of protection in case of an attack or inclement weather.</p>
<p>Serôsians generally eschewed armor , as the crucial elements of combat beneath the waves were maneuverability, mobility, and speed. The only forms of armor to be found in the undersea lands were pearl and silverweave . Both of these were the work of shalarin and triton craftsmen, though the latter was only worn during times of war.</p>
<p>Clothing too was generally absent among Serôsians, save for diaphanous silken weaves among the courts of the shalarin and sea elves, where they served as indicators of rank or positions. They were also once common among the nobility of Aryselmalyr, possibly a remnant of when the elves lived on the surface. The Serôsian indifference towards clothing was due to the fact that few fabrics existed that could provide any sense of protection or warmth within the water, the two primary purposes of clothing in the surface-world.</p>
<p>The most one could find adorning the body of a Serôsian were accessories such as jewelry , belts , harnesses, and bandoliers . These item-holding garments were typically made from woven kelp fronds that had been treated for durability or the treated hide of an eel or sea snake. Other than tight belts and bandoliers, magical jewelry usually took the form of chokers , rings , arm or leg bands, anklets , occasionally even amulets , and other forms of accessory that would produce as little drag as possible whilst swimmng. Most rings were typically carved from blaze or lucent coral, almost never metal, and inset with a pearl.</p>
<p>In terms of weaponry, Serôsians relied upon those that were best suited for aquatic combat. This often limited their selection to weapons that used a thrusting motion, such as daggers and knives , cutlasses , gaffs , harpoons , military forks , javelins , short swords , and most predominant of all tridents . Nearly all of the aquatic race had some slight variation on this weapon. Other races, namely locathah and sahuagin, also made offensive use of nets . But by far the most sought-after weapon among Serôsians was the tapal , an ancient weapon unique to the tritons.</p>
<p>When it came to materials, most weaponry in Serôs was forged of either bone, coral, stone, or specially treated materials, such as fire-hardened cryscoral. For example, the shalarin crafted light crossbows from coral and kelp, which unlike the wooden crossbows of the surface did not deteriorate underwater. Metal was usually not an ideal material, for it was subject to rusting and pitting , but this could be overcome by enchantments . For spellcasters, shells typically served the role as spell receptacles that wands and staves did on the surface-world. Tritons preferred the use of shells from clams , nautiluses , and sea turtles. Shalarins introduced to Serôs the use of hydrozoan branches coated in pearls. But the most rarest spell receptacle of all, capable of storing great magic, was that of a narwhal's horn.</p>
<p>Just as aquatic wizards had to adapt to a scarcity of wood, Serôsian mages found ways to adapt potions and oils to life in a fluid medium. They developed viscous substances, such as a thick gelatinous paste of kelp, that could then be either ingested or applied to the skin. And whilst bottles were used on the surface-world to hold potions, these magical substances were carried around in either clam shells or flexible tubes made from eelskins. Spell scrolls took the form of chemically treated sharkskin, cut into sheets, and written with inks derived from mixtures of magical kelp and coral. Once activated, this special ink would cause the scroll to be consumed, leaving nothing but a desiccated sharkskin.</p>
<p>The sharkskin method was used by some to create spellbooks very akin to those on the surface, though the shalarin magically treated their pages with a coating of pearl in order to enhance their durability. Other undersea races took more unique approaches, carving them into stone. Tritons carved their spells into isolated cavern walls in an esoteric script, whilst morkoths carved spells into stone spindles that they could read tactilely with their tentacles.</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>Whereas the lands and races of Faerûn were unified by the trade language of Commonspeech , the people of Serôs had no true unifying language, but three cross-cultural tongues allowed most Serôsians to communicate with one another. The Common Tongue was one of these three, with about 12% of aquatic people being versed in it by 1371 DR . In cosmopolitan areas, where increasing interaction was being had with surface-world adventurers and merchants, many more were learning how to speak it. In and around the city of Myth Nantar for example, about 25% of people knew Common. Most learned this tongue from aquatic elves.</p>
<p>Among the aquatic races of the Shallows, a pidgin language known as Serusan was used to bridge communication, acting as their own aquatic trade language. Serusan was an amalgamation of speech patterns from a multitude of racial languages. Some on the surface referred to these various racial languages collectively as the "Fallen Stars" tongues. Surface dwellers could find teachers of Serusan in Myth Nantar.</p>
<p>The third cross-cultural language was that of Currentspeak . It was the most incomprehensible to surface-worlders, as it relied upon the fluctuation of water across gills, flukes, and other membranes. It was commonly used by the aquatic races to speak with other creatures that couldn’t communicate using the aforementioned languages, such as whales.</p>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>The people of Serôs had a more limited range of deities that they worshiped, in comparison to the over a hundred gods revered across the surface races of Faerûn, though not all of these undersea gods were known to chroniclers and surface-worlders. How some of the known deities of the surface-world came to be revered in Serôs had no singular origin point. Some became known through contract or trade with the surface, others through the rescued faithful lost at sea spreading word of their faith, and still others were speculated to be so pervasive that knowledge of them precluded any sort of surface contact, like Mystra .</p>
<p>Among the Faerûnian pantheon , the gods that primarily saw reverence included Eldath , Milil , Mystra, Oghma , and Umberlee . Among the gods of the Asathalfinare pantheon , the most prominent in Serôs were Deep Sashelas , Eadro , Ishtishia , Persana , and Trishina . Lastly, among the known monstrous deities of the Realms, one could find reverence of Blibdoolpoolp by kuo-toan raiders from the Underdark and in the past by some morkoths, Ilxendren by the ixitxachitl, and Sekolah by the sahuagin.</p>
<p>Of all these gods, none had more temples throughout Serôs than Deep Sashelas, whom the sea elves believed created the undersea realms. By contrast, the ancient holy sites that once existed for Blibdoolpoolp were systematically eradicated from the depths, on a level not experienced by other deities, following the fall of the morkoth Theocracy.</p>
<p>Out of the surface powers of the Faerûnian pantheon, the one with the oldest presence was Mystra, whose worship beneath the waves stretched back to the time of Netheril . She most acted as a sort of bridge between surface-worlders and Serôsians. And Umberlee, while considered the ruler of the waves on the surface-world, was considered to only have dominion in the shallows. Those beneath the shallow zone viewed Eldath as the true goddess of the sea, working in concert with Deep Sashelas and Trishina, as well as Ishtishia to a loose extent.</p>
<p>One of the most mysterious groups of worship in the deep were Those Who Sleep Below , malevolent entities that dwelled in the sunless reaches of the Trench of Lopok. They were worshiped by the likes of kuo-toa, morkoths, and even krakens. Unbenknownst to the mortals, these entities were obyrith lords , with Dagon as the eldest among them. Dagon also has his own cult lurking amongst the shalarin communities of the deep, known as the Cult of Corynactis .</p>
<h3>Relations</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, the people of Serôs and the surface-world seldom interacted with one another. Though following the devastating Twelfth Serôs War, a conflict in which the people of the surface and Serôs had to come together to oppose the forces of Iakhovas, much of the surface nations around the Inner Sea became more acutely aware of their undersea neighbors. However, they surface-worlders remained woefully ignorant in many ways. Some, especially those in Sembia, feared that its aquatic races were new menaces to fear. Others felt it inconvenient having to acknowledge the sovereign territories thay lay beneath the waves their trade routes plied. And very few regarded the undersea kingdoms of Serôs as rightful equals to those of the surface.</p>
<h2>Law & Order</h2>
<p>Over a span of eight thousand years, from −7060 TS (−7130 DR) to 787 TS (717 DR) , a quasi-mystical order of monastic and martial wizards known as the Dukars acted as peacekeepers to the undersea lands of Serôs. Founded in the Second Epoch by the Aryselmalyr, unbound by loyalty to the empire, the organization was united under one guiding principle - to promote peace and harmony among all the races of Serôs. Helping to man the Pillars of the Trident against the sahuagin threat, keeping dangerous artifacts like the Emerald Eye of Kyron in custody, and protecting bystanders and innocents in the midst of wars.</p>
<p>In their last century of public activity, the Dukars established the Laws of Battle alongside a committee of merfolk and Shalarin in 730 TS (660 DR) , following the end of the ghastly Ninth Serôs War . Nearly a century after signing them, the Dukars went dormant for the next six hundred years due to some internal strife.</p>
<p>This pact, followed by nearly all of the civilized races of Serôs, was a shared code conduct for waging war against one another. Serôsians almost never willingly forsook these conventions, save for the likes of the savage koalinth, merrow, scrags, and sea hags. Even the sahuagin honored the Laws of Battle, for they were based heavily upon their culture, though this detail was long forgotten by many in Serôs by the 14 th century DR. Due to these conventions wars in Serôs tended to last no less than three months, composed of of intermittent battles with numerous lull. This pattern of fighting was to be adhered to regardless of a conflict's severity.</p>
<p>The Twelfth Serôs War would see the establishment of an alliance between the benevolent races of Serôs, including the likes of sea elves, shalarin, merfolk, morkoth, and the long thought lost Dukars. Named the Nantarn Alliance , for its formation and headquartering in the city of Myth Nantar, it continued to persist beyond the war, albeit in a tenous state. Members were hopeful of establishing defensive pacts in light of the looming sahuagin threat, of learning more from the surface-worlders, and interested in profiting from trade with them. Councilors rabidly discussed the need to put their ideals and hopes to writing, tying the alliance to constitutions, lest in time it all be muddled or forgotten. There were even talks to turn Myth Nantar into the center of a new union of sorts, much like Silverymoon was to the Silver Marches .</p>
<p>The returned Dukars situated themselves as the sword & shield of the Nantarn Alliance, to one day become the peace officers of not just Myth Nantar, but the allied waters the council represented. However, being mere shadows of their former glory, the Dukars chose to work in secrecy as they rebuilt their strength, accepting new members into their ranks from various races, even immigrants from the surface.</p>
<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>Whereas most of the surface-world used coins as currency , the people of Serôs lacked a standardized currency or monetary system. In most places trade was conducted through barter, with common barter goods including deepwater lucent coral, fish varieties, weapons, works of art, and bales of kelp.</p>
<p>Among the races of the shallows zone, pearls were commonly used as a form of currency, with the value applied to an individual pearl being denoted by its color. The proliferation of pearls as currency was promoted by merfolk and shalarin, who with their knowledge of how to culture pearls hoped to ease trade between Serosians and surface-worlders. However, by the late 14 th century DR, this practice still had yet to be adopted by the likes of ixitxachitls, morkoths, and tritons. To them they held no greater value than as ornamentation.</p>
<p>Over time, some began to recognize that people on the surface valued their pearls at a greater rate than the Serôsians themselves attributed to them. These differences were referred to by some as the "wet" and "dry values.</p>
<p>As far back as the Arresylmar Empire, one could find the people of Serôs engaging in trade with the surface world, when the sea elves had open relations with the elves of Cormanthyr . However, a new wave of interest in commerce with the surface was ushered in following the Twelfth Serôs War. In the month of Huntsong , 1428 TS (1358 DR) , limited trade began between the sea elf kingdoms and the port cities of Selgaunt and Suzail . This was followed in same year, in the month Eleasis , with Suzail's parent kingdom of Cormyr opening up direct trade with the undersea realms of Eeadral, Myth Nantar, and Naramyr. The Cormyrians traded sculptures and pickled fruits, whilst the Serôsians traded gold bars, raw coral, and various items long lost to the sea floor.</p>
<p>Some on the surface who had long made their riches on harvesting things from the deep, such as sponge-divers, feared competition with the Serôsians. Some sponge-divers resorted to spreading tall tales about the aquatic sentients in order to sully their reputation, telling of attacks on divers and child abductions.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The historians of Serôs divided the long history of the undersea realms into fifth distinct epochs. The First Epoch, also known as the Time of Beginnings, stretched far back into ages shrouded in fable and myth. None could agree upon a starting date for the epoch, though all historians seemed to judge it as having ended in −13,930 TS (−14,000 DR) , with the migrations of the sea elves into Serôs and their rise to power. One undersea carving from this epoch, dated to around −19,930 TS (−20,000 DR) , suggested that merfolk, locathah, and sahuagin had all lived and fought in Serôs as far back as that period.</p>
<p>The first of the elven migrations occured around -16900 DR , during the War of Three Leaves . Many fled from the kingdoms of Eiellur and Syorpiir , settling below in the Selmal Basin.</p>
<p>The Second Epoch, also known as the Time of Elves, began in either −13,930 TS (−14,000 DR) or −10,933 TS (−11,003 DR) with the building of Aryselmalyr. This epoch of Serôs was also marked by several significant events, including the creation of the Dukars, the first extended intrusion by surface-dwellers into the undersea realms, the first wave of immigration from the shalarin, the development of Serusan, and the first six Serôs Wars. The first of which was instigated by Aryselmalyr's building of the Sharksbane Wall and culminated in the elven empire herding the sahuagin behind it.</p>
<p>In −1650 TS (−1720 DR) , part of what became known as the Golden Age of Netheril , Netherese arcanists turned their sights to the depths of the Inner Sea and began settling undersea crystal domed cities in the northeastern reaches of Serôs, along its continental shelf, with the aid of their mythallars . These three Netherese enclaves – Cuulmath , Werapan , and Quelaavis – came to be known collectively as Deep Netheril. The surface-worlders would face steadfast resistance from the native Serosians. The Netherese in turn sought to enslave all who got close to their cities, with the most predominant race being the locathah. Less than a century later, in −1590 TS (−1660 DR) , Coronal Essyl Merynth , more than half the mages of Serôs, and a full contingent of Dukars bandied together to decisively drive out the Netherese. This later became known as the Battle of the Three Seaflames . Through their combined magics the domed cities were not only exploded, but their explosive force and resulting shock waves were held back, leaving them no place to go but back towards the coastline. The undersea lands of Serôs were left unmarred, whilst the coast gave way to Saerloon Bay and Selgaunt Bay .</p>
<p>In −1439 TS (−1509 DR) , the Wildtide Gate opened for the first time, ushering in the First Passing of the shalarin into Serôs. Unfortunately, the newcomers were quickly attacked by the mad kings Essyl and Kyron with the Emerald Eye , who had been corrupted by the influence of Dagon. This aggresion lead to the death of more than 75% of the shalarin wave of migrants.</p>
<p>On the surface in the −185 TS (−255 DR) , the green elves of Nikerymath harnessed the power of elven High Magic to call forth a cataclysmic tidal wave from the Jhaamdath Bay , instantly destroying all of the Twelve Cities of the Sword that sought to annihilate them. Unbeknownst to them, at the mouth of the inlet was Coryselmal , the capital of Aryselmalyr, and their wave would cause it too to be destroyed. Several small undersea villages and farms would also be destroyed, the victims of debris picked up and dragged back by the crashing wave. Over 40,000 sea elves perished, along with several other aquatic sentients. For the next forty years the people of Serôs would be at each others' throats, vying for territory long denied to them and to eradicate the elves, if possible. This conflict later became known as the Sixth Serôs War .</p>
<p>With the end of this war came the end of the Second Epoch, in −145 TS (−215 DR) . This was followed by the Third Epoch, the Time of Merfolk, which was marked by the rise of the merfolk empire of Hmurrath. For several centuries it would rule over the depths, until eventually succumbing to the same despotism that had doomed Aryselmalyr. Before long there was infighting, erupting into a series of seven civil wars that would later be known collectively as the Tenth Serôs War . This epoch would come to an end in 820 TS (750 DR) , when the last warring remnants of Hmurrath dissolved.</p>
<p>The Fourth Epoch, also known as the Time of Tempering, was marked by all the oracles and priests of every aquatic race in Serôs receiving a vision that three great challenges were to come and "temper the mettle" of the Serôsians, forever changing the currents of life in the undersea realms. Over the next several hundred of years, while the people of Serôs waited in dread anticipation of the "Forgers of Destiny", as the merfolk referred to them, the various undersea realms stagnated in a state of detente. For much of the period there was lack of any serious complications with trade, few looming threats to unify the people, and what threats did exist seemed under control by the "more civilized races".</p>
<p>The Fifth Epoch, the epoch of the Present Age, was ushered in 1371 DR. By that time, many Serôsians fell to a similar consensus on what exactly the prophesied "Forgers of Destiny" were, though some continued to debate the topic. The first event was believed to be the emergence of the tritons from the hidden depths in −36 TS (−106 DR) , breaking the ongoing war between the shalarin and the morkoth of the Theocracy. The second was the Time of Troubles in 1428 TS (1358 DR) , when the deities Anhur , Sekolah, and Umberlee appeared in the Inner Sea in their mortal avatar forms. And the third was Iakhovas, the great instigator and warmonger of the Twelfth Serôs War, who willfully disregarded the Laws of Battle and caused the shattering of the long-standing Sharksbane Wall.</p>
<p>When the Spellplague struck Toril in 1385 DR , great rifts opened up in the Underdark beneath the Inner Sea. This caused some of its water to drain down into the Glimmersea , leaving behind a large pit called the Underchasm . By the Year of Silent Death, 1395 DR , the waters of Serôs had stabilized, with the average drop in water level measured to be by nearly 50 feet (15 meters). This left the upper 30 feet (9.1 meters) of the Sharksbane Wall to tower over the surface waters. In the years between the Spellplague the Second Sundering , control of the depths was largely split between the sahuagin in the east and the sea elves of Myth Nantar in the west.</p>
