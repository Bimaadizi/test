<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The agent was described to be fairly plain-looking, though she had jet-black hair.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Several years prior to 1485 DR, Danae was tasked with traveling to Icewind Dale. Whilst here, she was to find out if anyone planned to move against Szass Tam and the Red Wizards of Thay . She had some success in this role, and enemies she identified suffered unexplained disappearances.</p>
