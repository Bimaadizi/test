<p>Mystery of the Dead was a unique enchanted shield that offered its wielders protection against death magic .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Mystery was a large shield of steel . Its front had enameled patterns that came together to form a single skull in the center. Ancient writings were etched all over the shield but they remained undeciphered, all apart from a single phrase in red that read: "AND WHAT OF THE DEAD?"</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The shield possessed a protective +3 enchantment and offered additional protection against missile weapons. But its true value came from offering complete immunity against death magic and such spells as power word, kill and finger of death . However, Mystery of the Dead could only be wielded by humans and half-elves .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Mystery of the Dead shield was a complete mystery. Its past was magically concealed from divinations .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , Mystery of the Dead was in the hands of the shady drow merchant named Nym , when he was peddling his magic goods from a svirfneblin village in the depths of Dorn's Deep in the Spine of the World .</p>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Mystery of the Dead was still in Nym's hands. The shield was available for purchase from his camp outside Bryn Shander 's wall.</p>
