<p>Bremen was the westernmost of the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale . It attracted all manner of gold prospectors, travelers and treasure-hunters.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Bremen was located on the southwestern shore of Maer Dualdon , where the Shaengarne River met the lake. Bremen's position made it susceptible to flooding, although Bremenites knew the signs and lives were rarely lost because of it.</p>
<h2>Defense</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , Bremen could rally a meager force of about 25 soldiers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bremen was originally founded by a group of dwarven prospectors led by Rölph Bremen , whose statue was placed at the heart of the town.</p>
<p>The town was nearly destroyed just prior to the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR in the invasion of the Icewind Dale by the Legion of the Chimera .</p>
<p>In Year of the Worm, 1356 DR , Bremen and Caer-Konig were given to the barbarians of Icewind Dale after the war with Akar Kessell . Revjak , the king of the Tribe of the Elk, served as "speaker for the barbarians" in council until his leadership was successfully challenged by Berkthgar in 1364 DR, ending the period of cooperation between the Reghed tribes and Ten-Towns.</p>
<p>The spokesman of the town around the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR was Gil Haerngen , who, like other Bremenites, had a hobby of searching for gold and treasure on the floodplains along the banks of the river.</p>
<p>In 1483 DR, the adventurer Catti-brie set up a home base in Bremen while waiting for her appointed rendezvous with her friends.</p>
<p>During the years of the Everlasting Rime , Bremen offered the sacrifice of warmth to Auril . Residents of the town forewent any fires one day each month.</p>

<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , rumors circulated in Bremen about a "lake monster" that appeared in Maer Dualdon, that regularly attacked local fishing boats. This monster was in fact a plesiosaurus , that had peacefully dwelled within the lake's waters, but was recently awakened by a Aurilian druid called Ravisin .</p>
