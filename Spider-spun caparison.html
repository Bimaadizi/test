<p>The spider-spun caparison was an extraordinary spidersilk outfit found in the Demonweb Pits in the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The caparison was all-black except for a dark red waistwrap. It was durable, flexible, and almost weightless.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The spider-spun caparison was best suited to monks , who benefited in their mastery of unarmed combat and use of ki while wearing it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This outfit was found during the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar —when Ymris the yugoloth worked with Cormyrean forces to invade the Realm of Ruin and kill Lolth 's servant Kishnaurac . Along the way he may have summoned a group of arcanaloth reinforcements—only to have their services be out-bid by Kishnaurac and turned against him. The spider-spun caparison may have been taken from these overly-opportunistic fiends .</p>
