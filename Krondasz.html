<p>Krondasz was a dwarvish thief from the town of Skull Crag in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Krondasz was an especially ugly male dwarf, even in his relative youth.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The dwarf was armed with a short sword , wore a set of banded mail armor and a helmet . He carried a sling instead of a bow , typical for his profession.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the early 1360s DR , when Krondasz was just 43 winters old, the famed hero of the Skull Crag Keep , Arelin Starbrow , perished in a treacherous monster attack. With her death, a set of powerful enchanted items was stolen â€“ the Arms of the Roadwarden . Krondasz's boss, one of Arelin's children, Dazmilar Starbrow was tasked with the retrieval of the Sword of the Roadwarden . A group of heroes who joined the defenders of the Keep agreed to help Dazmilar in the task. Krondasz was sent along with the band to make sure the task would be completed, to the dwarf's chagrin. Krondasz was a thief and not an adventurer, as a matter of fact, he could not stand the adventuring kind because they "never bathed." When the task was completed, Krondasz left the adventurers and returned to his richly decorated room at the The Weary Wanderer inn in Skull Crag.</p>
