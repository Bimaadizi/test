<p>Elven High Magic , Arselu'Tel'Quess in Elven or the Great Art of the People , was the term used to describe one of the most powerful forms of magic practiced in Faerûn . Casters of this magic were called Selu'taar , also known as the "Art's Disciples" or simply as "High Mages".</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>High Magic spells were powerful enough to affect deities or create world-changing spell effects. Non-elves could not cast High Magic as they were simply unable to wield such power without being consumed by it, and in truth even most elves were found lacking in the necessary finesse and skill.</p>
<p>All High Magic spells were rituals, and they frequently required collaboration of more than one High Mage. In addition, the necessary material components and timing of High Magic could be very specific. For example, in 1375 DR a priest of Vhaeraun used a High Magic spell to open the realm of Eilistraee to Vhaeraun, in order that he might slay her. The components for this mighty ritual included a certain specific configuration of heavenly bodies appearing in the skies over Faerûn.</p>
<p>The elven patron deity Corellon was capable of blocking elven high magic, at his discretion, by means of a divine arrangement he formed with the goddess Mystra .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was also High Magic that destroyed the ancient elven realm Tintageer around −25,400 DR and also what was used to open the gate between Faerie and Abeir-Toril to help the survivors escape. However, the caster of the spell to open the gate was also consumed by the power of her spell.</p>
<p>The most significant use of High Magic was probably the creation of Evermeet around −17,600 DR during the First Flowering . The elves cast the spell but miscalculated, and not only did all the casters bearing the focus die, they only succeeded because their deities intervened. Regardless, the continent of Faerûn was sundered and thousands were slain.</p>
<p>During the Crown Wars , around −10,500 DR High Mages of Aryvandaar caused the so-called Dark Disaster and destroyed the realm of Miyeritar . Another example of elven High Magic of this period was cast by the elves with the help of the Seldarine to punish the dark elves . They were turned into the drow and after that their descent began.</p>
<p>By the 14 th century DR, elven high magic was a dying craft. The high mages grew reluctant to teach new ones, due to the elves' potential for reckless and irresponsible use. This made it likely for the craft to die out in a single generation.</p>
<p>Another example of High Magic was used by Q'arlynd Melarn to wipe the name of Kiaransalee from the minds of her worshipers, thus eliminating her mortal followers. Due to the edict of Ao , any deity without mortal worship could no longer exist, and so Kiaransalee ceased to exist in the world of Toril.</p>
<h2>Language</h2>
<p>Elven High Magic was written in the Seldruin language, which used the Hamarfae alphabet.</p>
<h2>Types of Ritual</h2>
<p>High Magic rituals were roughly divided into three different types.</p>
<h3>Rituals of Solitude</h3>
<p>Rituals of Solitude were the lowest level, touching the direct source of magic the least, and they could be cast by a solitary high mage. Despite their name, many of these ritual spell effects could involve bolstering the morale of entire armies of elves or of demoralizing their foe's forces.</p>
<h3>Rituals of Complement</h3>
<p>Rituals of Complement required three high mages working in tandem, and they required more time and were more complex. Effects included creating permanent gates , the creation of many magic items at once, and creating a phantasmal illusion capable of hiding an entire elven homeland.</p>
<h3>Rituals of Myriad</h3>
<p>Rituals of Myriad were the most powerful form of High Magic and required at least five high mages, though some of these rituals required many more participants. Examples of Rituals of Myriad included the creation of the mythals of elven cities.</p>
<h2>Adaptations</h2>
<p>Elven High Magic had a number of ways to make its casting easier. For example, when one wanted to create a mythal , the death of the caster was an easy and reliable way to fill the gap between the skill of the caster and the skill required by the spell. It was considered one of the most honorable ways to die in elven culture, which was the reason why many high mages died casting a spell when they reached a level of skill that was high enough for their death to cover the shortfall.</p>
<p>In another example of making up for lack of resources were the Vhaeraunites who tried to open a gate between Ellaniath , Vhaeraun's realm, to Arvandor . What they needed was numbers, estimated to be in the hundreds, while they were only four and had no willingness to sacrifice themselves. Thus, they tapped the power of an earth node that happened to be in a darkstone cavern, which reduced the required number of casters to three, and used a spell called soultheft . As the name implies, each of them stole a soul and used its energy to fuel the magic, thus keeping their own lives safe.</p>
