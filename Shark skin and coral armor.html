<p>Shark skin and coral armor was a type of aquatic studded leather armor crafted by the sahuagin of the Sea of Moving Ice .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These sets of leather armors were created using shark skin and extremely hard coral studs. The design was aimed specifically at aquatic humanoids. All those not used to underwater life felt rigid, restricted, and clumsy while wrapped in these shark leathers. Unlike other mundane types of studded leathers, shark skin and coral armor also gave the wearers additional protection from fire and acid.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , these types of armor were rarely seen on any other creatures apart from sahuagin of the Sea of Moving Ice.</p>
