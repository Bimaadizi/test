<h2>History</h2>
<p>Komoku ordered that a long silver cord be stretched across the Sea of Blossoms , with one end tied to a tree on top of Mount Fo on Tsukishima and other end tied to a similar tree on top of Mount Chusa on Shidekima . This was to prevent the whole island of Shidekima from drifting away. Naturally enough, the trees were closely guarded.</p>
