<p>Alaron , also known as Westshae or the High King's Isle , was the most populous island in the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The island was roughly divided in half by the Fairheight Mountains . The southern part of Alaron was a fertile land ideal for farming of grassy low hills and dales. The largest city on the island was Caer Callidyrr , located on the northern edge of Dernall Forest . Moonwells could be found across the island.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<h3>Callidyrr</h3>
<p>The southern half of the island traditionally comprised the Ffolk Kingdom of Callidyrr , ruled from the capital city of Caer Callidyrr. With the rise of High King Tristan Kendrick in the mid–14 th century DR , Caer Callidyrr became the capital of all Ffolk realms in the Moonshaes, and with the rise of High Queen Alicia Kendrick , it became the capital of the United Moonshae Isles in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR . Alaron was thus considered the most powerful island prior to the Spellplague . However, with the decline of the unified kingdom, the Kendricks came to be kings and queens of only Alaron as of the late 15 th century DR. The High King at this time was Derid Kendrick . The castle from which the Kendrick family ruled, the Palace of the High King , was built by the very first High King of Moonshae, Cymrych Hugh .</p>
<h3>Garhelm</h3>
<p>The northern half of the island comprised the Northlander kingdom of Gnarhelm , traditionally ruled from the city of Gnarhelm . As of the late 15 th century DR, even as their kin in Norland had declared independence from the High King, Gnarhelm remained under Kendrick rule, its culture having become a blend of Northlander and Ffolk and its inhabitants coming to see themselves as Moonshavians rather than as Northlanders. The combined might of Callidyrr and Gnarhelm made Alaron effectively the most powerful kingdom in the Moonshae Isles.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The island was once populated only by the Llewyrr . When humans first migrated to the Moonshaes, the Llewyrr were pushed into the wilder parts of the Isles.</p>
<p>As the island became beset by threats in the late 15 th century DR, notably unseelie fey , lycanthropes , and Amnian mercenaries, many of Alaron's inhabitants were forced to flee their villages and travel to the relative safety of Caer Callidyrr.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The majority of the Moonshaes' human population lived on Alaron. The southern half of the island was home to the Ffolk, while the northern half of the island was home of the Northlander kingdom of Gnarhelm. As these two cultures merged in the 15 th century DR following the unification of these realms, they came to share many traditions as well as a strong respect for both the land and the sea.</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, Dernall Forest teemed with goblins , werewolves , fomorians , and other evil fey . Druids and rangers loyal to King Derid waged war against them. A few shifters were known to make their homes on Alaron, however they were feared and hated by the local humans, who did not perceive a difference between shifters and lycanthropes.</p>
<p>The Fairheight Mountains were home to the dwarven clans Rustfire and Rookoath , who were at war with the dark fey and a shadow dragon during the late 15 th century DR.</p>
<p>Unicorns lived in the isolated wilderness of the island.</p>
