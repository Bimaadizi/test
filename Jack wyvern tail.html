<p>Jack wyvern tail , also known as Jack's wyvern tail and sometimes old wyvern tail , was a Cormyrean dish designed to imitate the taste and texture of the meat from the tail of a wyvern .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The dish was a blend of chopped pork , turkey , and rabbit meat. It had to be prepared carefully to approximate the succulence of true wyvern meat, but was not a perfect substitute. It was eaten either as a hot entree or as cold slices with bread .</p>
<p>The same spices traditionally used when preparing wyvern tail were used in the preparation of jack wyvern tail, sometimes including asparagus broth and almonds .</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>With a decline in the population of wyverns in the Stonelands as of the midâ€“14 th century DR , jack wyvern tail grew in popularity as real wyvern tail became harder to acquire in Cormyr.</p>
<p>The Old Oyster restaurant in Monksblade was famous for its "old wyvern tail", which was made with a secret recipe and served in the size and shape of a wyvern's tail with skin made of crispy pork crackling . It was served over a bed of fried potatoes covered in mushroom - cream sauce, and was big enough for four full meals.</p>
