<p>Raneger was a watersoul genasi crime lord whose base of operations was the Den of Games in Airspur . He was widely considered to be the most powerful criminal in the city. He was grossly obese and spent most of his time soaking his bulk in a pool.</p>
<p>In 1479 DR , Raneger allowed a drow named Chenraya to store illicit items in his warehouse although he wasn't aware of their true nature nor the drow's plot. When confronted by the deva Demascus he agreed to aid in tracking down the drow.</p>
