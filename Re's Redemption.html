<p>Re's Redemption were enchanted Greataxes created by the Mulhorandi deity Re .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These axes possessed a potent +2 enchantment. When wielded against orc and orc-kin, Re's Redemption effectively became a powerful +4 magic weapon. Additionally, when such axe landed a successful cleave on an evil creature, it dealt additional lightning damage.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The history of these powerful weapons began where their creator's story ended. During the calamitous Mulhorandi Orcgate Wars , the avatars of the Mulhorandi pantheon stood on the nation's soil and fought against the horde. Re was killed in the conflict, and with his dying breath, he created hundreds of enchanted great axes. Each weapon was dedicated to slaying orcs, and the great horde was forced northward with their aid. These weapons became known as Re's Redemption .</p>
<p>As of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , one such axe belonged to dwarf member of the Neverwinter Nine – Callum .</p>
