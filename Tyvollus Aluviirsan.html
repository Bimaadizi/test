<p>Tyvollus Aluviirsan was a elven high mage who was born during the time of the height of Cormanthyr . He transformed the stolen sets of the Nether Scrolls into the Quess'Ar'Teranthvar , the "Golden Grove of Hidden Knowledge".</p>
<p>It was said that, for centuries after, he still watched over the Quess'Ar'Teranthvar, his body in stasis and his mind locked in reverie . Should he be separated from the tree it would collapse into molten metal. After 20 years or less, the metal would once again reform itself into the shape of the metal scrolls that the Netherese were familiar with.</p>
