<p>Heurodis was a powerful medusa sorceress who sought to revive the Netherese flying city of Undrentide and use it to gain great power for herself.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>She managed to reawaken and bind to herself the power of the mythallar powering the city, turning into a lich from its power and managed to make the city take flight again. Just as Undrentide was rising up from the sands of Anauroch , the mythallar was destroyed and Heurodis killed by an adventurer who was the former student of Drogan Droganson , whom Heurodis had killed previously.</p>
