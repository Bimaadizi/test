<p>Merzan was one of the Blades of the Old Man in the fortress of Sentinelspire in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He was a part of the team accompanying Sauk to look for Kheil and secure the Erael'len in the Northern Shalhoond in Tarsakh of 1374Â DR , conspiring to kill the Old Man of the Mountain . Merzan was tall and swarthy, with the build and complexion of a Thayan . He wore western clothes, and kept both his hair and beard well trimmed. To Berun , he seemed like a stone-cold killer. He watched over Berun and Lewan for Sauk while on the way back to Sentinelspire ; after Sauk offered Berun a chance to help him hunt some yaqubi and he turned it down, Sauk decided Valmir should watch them instead, with Merzan joining Sauk's hunting party.</p>
