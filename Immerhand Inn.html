<p>The Immerhand Inn was an inn located in the city of Wheloon in Cormyr . Its proprietor was Chalthos Immer .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Immerhand Inn was in business by 1358 DR . It was still in business circa 1369 DR .</p>
<p>Famed traveler Volothamp Geddarm wrote about the business in Volo's Guide to Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The inn was situated on a waymoot on Wheloon's northwestern fringe, a short distance north of Rathool's Pond .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was a dark and rustic-looking building, with stables, a muddy wagonyard, and an outhouse.</p>
<p>Inside the inn, the furniture was a random and mismatched selection of bought, scavenged, and roughly home-made pieces. Each room had beds, stools, and chests, and was lit by a huge storm lantern such as Chalthos had relied on as a mercenary. Another memento of his career were the paintings he'd looted from around Faerûn ; one in each room provided the sole decoration.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Immerhand Inn was Wheloon's third best inn—out of three. It was a poor quality place that provided no food or drink, do-it-yourself stabling and feeding of mounts, and patrons had to pump their own water for washing.</p>
<p>It wasn't well known, and typically used by drovers and caravan merchants who wanted to stay out of the crowded town centre.</p>
