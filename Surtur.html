<p>Surtur , also seen as Surtr , was worshiped as the giant god of the fire giants .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Surtur looked like an immensely large fire giant with crackling flames in place of hair and eyebrows.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Surtur's signature weapon was a greatsword , wreathed in flame and 15 feet (4.6 meters) in length. He was also known to wear iron armor that was incredibly hot.</p>
<h2>Realm</h2>
<p>Surtur ruled Muspelheim . In the World Tree cosmology this ever-burning realm was part of the Neutral Plane of Jotunheim and was connected by a portal to the Elemental Plane of Fire . In the Great Wheel cosmology it was located on the fiery second layer of the plane of Ysgard ; the layer was also called Muspelheim , named for Surtur's realm. In addition, Surtur shared the realm of Jotunheim on the layer of Ysgard with Thrym , where the Lord of the Fire Giants resided in the ancient hall of Meerrauk .</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Nearly all of Surtur's worshipers were giants. A select few members of other races were known to have earned his approval, but they concealed their devotion to the giant lord.</p>
<p>Surtur taught that fire was pure, cleansing, and strong. The weak and impure burned, while the strong survived. Fire was useful as a tool, but must be respected. It was dangerous when uncontrolled.</p>
<p>Surtur's temples in the lands of men were hidden affairs. Those that were not hidden were huge buildings ringing with the sounds of forges and storing weapons in preparation for the battle at the end of the world. Visitors had only a few seconds to prove their intentions before the fire giants attacked. Fire giants did not enjoy leaving witnesses to their activities.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Surtur, a son of Annam , was part of the second generation of giantish deities, born at about the same time as Skoraeus Stonebones and Thrym .</p>
