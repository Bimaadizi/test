<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Nanathlor Greysword first became the ruler of Loudwater in the Year of the Shattered Oak, 1313 DR , he hired Barnabas to work for him. Time and time again, he proved his worth in the tasks assigned to him. When the town became aware of the balor Grintharke and the wider machinations of the evil forces of Hellgate Keep , Barnabas suggested he become a spy and infiltrate their forces. Over time, Barnabas worked his way up the ranks.</p>
<p>Around the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , the lich Pomerian led an army on behalf of Grintharke through the Underdark and back out to the surface in a surprise attack on the town of Llorkh . His forces comprised a horde of various orc tribes, a quarter of which were worg cavalry, 18 ogres from the Greypeak Mountains , 13 hill giants likewise from the Greypeaks, and 19 elite drow troops from Menzoberranzan . And amongst them was Barnabas, serving as one of Pomerian's minor staff officers.</p>
<p>Shortly before leading his army to the surface, Pomerian uncovered that Barnabas was a spy. Rather than eliminating him right away, the lich decided to keep the half-orc around and fed with nominal intel, reasoning that the double-agent could be exploited in the future to create diversions when needed. Using the Pipes of Doom , a bagpipes artifact that Grintharke's former master had created, the lich was able to rout Llorkh's forces before they had a chance to repulse the invasion. The Hellgate army then set their sights on the town of Loudwater, whose ruler was nevertheless able to prepare for an attack thanks to forewarning by Barnabas.</p>
<p>When the Battle of Loudwater commenced, Pomerian darkened the fair skies by summoning thick, foreboding clouds with the Pipes of Doom's control weather power. He then used spell scrolls to cast mass invisibility on his drow forces, enabling them to attempt a stealth attack on the enemy command post. Finally, the lich took to the center of the horde, flanked by ogres, and proceeded to play the Pipes of Doom to induce a steady retreat from the forces amassed at Loudwater.</p>
<p>Which side was victorious in this battle was ultimately uncertain, though the odds were firmly stacked against the forces of Loudwater and they were said to have suffered staggering losses. With a draw in the conflict, the Hellgate army set up camp for the night near the South Wood , working to construct huge rafts with which to cross the otherwise impassable River Shining .</p>
<p>Shortly after the night's evenfeast, while Pomerian plotted the next day's strategy within his command tent , a group of korreds snuck into camp and stole the Pipes of Doom . Once Pomerian realized they were missing, he sent a force of elite individuals out into the woods to recover the stolen Pipes and kill the thieving korreds. Lead by the fire giant Slag , they included the drow Lilliana , George the gorgon , and roguish twin princes Dammek and Dammon .</p>
<p>Barnabas took this opportunity to slink off to the opposing camp and tell Nanathlor what had transpired and of Pomerian's arrogance. He did not know what the creatures were that had stolen the Pipes of Doom , describing them as being the size of gnomes , but with long wild hair and beards, overall hairy bodies that smelled of fresh dirt and pine needles, and legs like a satyr . He spoke of the leader of these creatures having used a large pair of silver shears to slice through the canvas of Pomerian's tent and leaving without attacking anyone, save for some guards they had tossed into the woods. Before he could go on, Barnabas was interrupted by Traskar Selarn , ruler of the allied town of Secomber , who proclaimed that his description sounded like korreds and opined that they must be immune to the effects of the Pipes of Doom . With slow deliberation, Nanathlor agreed. This gave the forces of Loudwater newfound hope, for if they could retrieve the Pipes before the Hellgate army and destroy them, Loudwater would have a chance at routing the invaders. And so, after receiving further intel from Barnabas on the forces sent to retrieve the bagpipes, a group of renowned adventurers set forth on this quest.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Barnabas, when he returned to the Hellgate camp he was swiftly detained under suspicion. Pomerian subjected him to an ESP spell , probing his mind for what had just went down back at Nanathalor's camp. Then, seeing no further use for the spy, Pomerian killed Barnabas and left to join his dispatched squad in the recovery of the Pipes of Doom .</p>
