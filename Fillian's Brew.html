<p>The strange and unusual Fillian's Brew was one of the strongest alcoholic concoctions in Daggerford , lovingly named the Bitch Queen's Revenge by the local sailors.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Extremely potent, Fillian's Brew was brewed using a special blend of hops , barley , and sixty-four other secret ingredients.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Fillian's Best could be purchased in the River Quarter of Daggerford circa 1372 DR . It was sold by an eccentric gnome brewer named Fillian. The advertisement claiming the drink was strong enough to knock a stone giant out and put hair on an elf 's chest was possibly a bit exaggerated.</p>
