<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sarya had deep red skin and bright orange and gold hair. She preferred to wear her magically protective black robes embroidered with gold. She had a seductive beauty and classic elven features. She was short and girlish. Her gold eyes burned like bright coals, and she had large, bat-like wings emerging from her back.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Sarya wore the Gilded Gown of Selussa , which was a black robe embroidered with gold that was enchanted to the strength of steel, and carried a zalanthar wood staff called Miillaethm's Staff . Also, she had Aduce's Whip , and wore the Emerald Earring of Vhoadan .</p>
<p>She recovered a levitating Vyshaanti battle platform from the ruins of Nar Kerymhoarth . It was forty feet (12 m) across and had armored sides.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Sarya's father was a balor . She was the youngest child and only daughter of Lady Xiiltharra Dlardrageth . She had a son called Xhalph who was born after her coupling with a glabrezu . She also had a nephew named Xhalth and a deceased son, Ryvvik , who was of vrock heritage and a psionic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sarya was magically imprisoned thousands of years ago in a location on top of which Ascalhorn and later Hellgate Keep would be built. In 1369 DR she was set free when the prison was cracked after the Harpers used the Gatekeeper's Crystal to raze the city of Hellgate Keep.</p>
<p>In 1374 DR, burning with wrath for being imprisoned thousands of years, Sarya, attempted to take vengeance upon the descendants of her enemies. She freed the remainder of her Daemonfey kin from Nar Kerymhoarth ( Nameless Dungeon ), and moved from her hideout beneath Lothen of the Silver Spires to Myth Glaurach. This was where she corrupted the Mythal, perverted its wards, and used it to summon an army of demons bound to her service. She also recruited orcs, bugbears, and goblins. Sarya first attacked small wood elf settlements in the High Forest , then launched an attack on Evereska . [ citation needed ]</p>
<p>After lackluster results on both attempts, she decided to secretly move into the ruins of Myth Drannor and carve out a kingdom in the forest of Cormanthor . Here she could press into service both demons and devils. Not only was her residency of the formerly glorious Myth Drannor a dire insult to elven-kind, but Sarya fully intended to use it as a stronghold to slowly conquer the entire region of the Dalelands , the Moonsea , and Sembia . With the help of her mysterious fiendish patron, The Branded King , Sarya even got the lingering powers of Myth Drannor's mythal to work in her favor. [ citation needed ]</p>
<p>Sarya's plans were, however, eventually thwarted by the elven army of Seiveril Miritar , mercenary armies from Sembia , various small human armies of the Dales, and in no small part by the efforts of the sun-elf wizard, Araevin Teshurr . [ citation needed ]</p>
