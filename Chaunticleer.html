<p>Brother Chaunticleer was a brother at the Edificant Library who sung the Canticle of Deneir at mid-day every day.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>During the Chaos Curse , he momentarily forgot the words while thinking of fishing, and that proved to Cadderly Bonaduce that something was terribly wrong with the library.</p>
<p>When Cadderly finally returned to a doomed and desecrated library, he eventually found Chaunticleer in his room, which he had warded against vampires so Kierkan Rufo and his zombie and vampire lackeys could not enter.</p>
