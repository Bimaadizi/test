<p>Flash globes were non- magical items that drow used against sentient creatures of the Underdark , including their own kind.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As the name suggested, flash globes were globes. They were made of glass. The contents of them were the distillate of deepcap mushrooms , a luminous irritant. They were full of the stuff. These weapons were thrown or flung with a staff sling against enemies.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, a flash globe contained the distillate of deepcap mushrooms. On hitting the ground or a wall, a cloud of vaporized contents came into being. This cloud was 10 ft (3 m) in diameter and 12 ft (3.7 m) tall in the former case, or in the latter case only 5 ft (1.5 m) diameter. As mentioned above, the liquid contained within a flash globe was an irritant. Creatures exposed to it were blinded and scratched their eyes and could do nothing else for seven to ten minutes. The blinding effect could be solved by washing the eyes for one minute. The liquid was luminous and coming into contact with the cloud made the affected creature easier to physically hit for two to five minutes; washing for one minute solved this too.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Flash globes were items associated with the drow. They were used by their war bands to fight sentient Underdark creatures like mind flayers .</p>
