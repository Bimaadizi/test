<p>Khaelud ( pronounced : /ˈ k eɪ l ʌ d / KAY-lud ) was a realm of territorial gold dwarves in east Faerûn , home to the Khaelhund clan.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The realm was beneath the volcanic Smoking Mountains , with frequent magma and gas vents.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>As of the 15 th century DR , the Khaeldarr dwarves used the local volcanism for their smelting and metalworking. All trade was conducted by expeditions to other lands, as they were so isolationist that all outsiders in their section of the Underdark were considered intruders to be killed on sight. They also had conflict with the dwarves of Fireforges to the north over mining claims.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The volatile gases that filled the realm slowly affected the dwarves over generations, sickening and gradually mutating them.</p>
