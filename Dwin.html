<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Dwin was among the group of friends that Adamar Session tried to convince to go adventuring on the island of Wavecrest . It took him quite some time to convince them that there was a reason to do so. Everyone they met would warn them that some kind of evil creature roamed the island, slaying man and beast alike. But eventually, Adamar managed to assemble Dwin, Anathet, and Sarun into an adventuring company. The small band set out for Wavecrest, intent on finding the fabled buried treasure of Captain Hanshet , a pirate captain whom legends say buried a thousand gold bars near a large grove of petrified briars.</p>
<p>They arrived to Wavecrest in the early summer and found themselves assaulted by the jungles' insects, namely mosquitoes . For more than two days they hacked their way through Wavecrest's dense forests, luckily never encountering trouble greater than the insects. They rested each evening with a campfire, regaling themselves with stories of Captain Hanshet.</p>
<p>Just as the adventurers were drawing close to Wavecrest's center they found a large artificial cave, made up of broken trees and shrubs. Instead of golden bars, they found merely a couple of copper trinkets inside and the lair of a shimmering jaguar-like creature , measuring 7 feet (2.1 meters) tall at the shoulder. Anathet drew his sword as the creature leapt at him, believing he could block its strike, but with one swipe of its to his head the fighter was sent tumbling to the ground with a nasty, bleeding gash.</p>
<p>The adventurers cautiously circled around the creature with the injured fighter, making their way out of the cave as the creature watched them with its emerald eyes. With panic they ran and stumbled through the jungle for several hours, making it back to their rowboat just as night was falling. As they paddled under the cover of dark, Dwin used her divine magic to heal Anathet. None of them blamed Adamar for what happened, Dwin even quipping that "Fortune favors the bold," but the bard felt that he was at fault for dragging them into such danger.</p>
