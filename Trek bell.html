<p>A trek bell was a magical item of transportation.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A trek bell was an immense dull iron sphere, large enough to hold four or five people. Runes covered the outside of the sphere. The entire bottom was open; per Neifion , that was called a moon well.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A trek bell could protect those within from nearly any medium or environment. It could move through earth, stone, and water. However, it was possible to fall from the bottom.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1396Â DR , Neifion freed himself from his pact with Japheth Donard by swearing to bring him to Xxiphu . Neifion decided to do that by means of a trek bell , which he had previously employed to visit the Fomorian court.</p>
<p>The trek bell was lowered by an angel of exploration named Mapathious , also bound by Neifion, across an extradimensional passage bound for Xxiphu. While inside the trek bell, Japheth was attacked by one of Neifion's homunculi, but the trip happened without further incident.</p>
<p>The trek bell was dropped near a balcony of the city when Mapathious was attacked by Gethshemeth , the kraken . Moments later, Neifion burst from the trek bell , after his original pact with Japheth was broken by the destruction of its corresponding pact stone.</p>
