<p>House Veltro was a mercenary company and noble family of Colletro , one of the city-states of the Blade Kingdoms . The Veltros possessed a significant number of troops, granting the House's leader the title of a Blade Captain and the privilege to vote in a Blade Council . House Veltro was easily recognizable by particolored livery, unique to the mercenary company.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>House Veltro, led by its young Blade Captain, participated in an annual "white war" between the cities of Colletro and Sumbria of the Year of the Falling Moon, 1217 DR . The battle took place in early summer, and the city-stated warred over the lush Valley of Umbricci . The bloodless competition of tactical wits resulted in Sumbria's triumph. One of the ambitions Blade Captains of Colletro, Ugo Svarézi , vibrantly voiced his disdain for the bloodless and "cowardly" traditions of the Blade Kingdoms' conflicts. His disdain was fueled by the loss of the Sun Gem , the symbolic heart of the Kingdoms, loss of the Valley, and loss of a betrothed Mannicci bride, a political alliance via marriage. Blade Captain Veltro was infuriated by Svarézi's disrespect of laws and traditions of the Blade Kingdoms. Veltro readied himself to challenge Svarézi to a duel, but the Prince-elect of Colletro, Ricardo , shut it down, calling for peace in the face of provocation.</p>
<p>As per tradition, the Festival of Blades followed the resolution of the bloodless war. The 1217 DR Festival took place in the city of Sumbria and welcomed soldiers, Blade Captains, and political dignitaries from the neighboring nations and the local city-states. During the Festival, Blade Captain Veltro and several of his trusted warriors caught up with Ugo Svarézi, ambushing him at an alley in Sumbria. Veltro attempted to send the honorless Blade Captain Svarézi into Baator . Ugo Svarézi sicced his vicious black hippogriff Shaatra on Veltro's men. Overpowered, Blade Captain Veltro attempted to retreat but was slain by his own men who switched their allegiance to vile Hose Svarézi.</p>
