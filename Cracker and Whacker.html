<p>Cracker and Whacker were twin morning stars that were the chief weapons of the dwarf Athrogate .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cracker and Whacker were both gray glassteel morning stars , with spiked metal heads attached to the ends of adamantine chains. Athrogate generally wielded Cracker in the left hand and Whacker in the right hand.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>On command, Cracker emitted from the small nubs on the striking ball a dark reddish and chalky fluid, the ichor of a rust monster , which corroded other metals on contact. Whacker coated itself with a clear, blue-gray, oily liquid known as oil of impact , which oozed from the spikes. Used together, with first a strike by Cracker then strikes by Whacker , Athrogate could smash anything from a thick iron wall to an iron golem into rust flakes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1484 DR , Athrogate used his morning stars to smash through the iron wall sealing off Mithral Hall from the Underdark .</p>
