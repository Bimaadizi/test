<p>An everful jug of lard was an enchanted jug that could produce batches of thick cooking lard.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The lard produced by these jugs was of such thick consistency that it could not be poured out, but rather had to be scooped out of the vessel. The lard was flammable. And while originally created for the purposes of cooking, it was found that spreading the lard over a smooth surface produced an effect similar to a low-powered casting of the grease spell .</p>
<p>If heat was ever applied to an everful jug of lard , the jug would lose its enchantment.</p>
