<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early History</h3>
<p>Approximately 375 prior to the mid-14 th DR , two brothers, Oswulf and Eldamar , built the Castle of the Twins in the Dragonspine Mountains. Over the next quarter of a century, the mining town of Verdigris was established below the castle. The residents of Verdigris would convene in the town hall, and the brothers would guide them. Under their guidance, the town became very prosperous.</p>
<p>When Eldamar became old, he transformed into a lich known as the Dreadlord, and the town of Verdigris became ruined and filled with vile creatures. Oswulf left town, and formed the Silver Blades . When the Silver Blades arrived, they cleared the ruined town, and froze the valley in a huge glacier.</p>
<h3>14 th century DR</h3>
<p>In the early 14 th century DR, the Black Circle formed from the descendants of Eldamar's followers. They began to slowly penetrate the ice. As the ice emerged, miners of the mountains near the Verdigris Valley took notice. A few months later, a boomtown was established at the valley's mouth. This new settlement became known as New Verdigris , and the mining operations were back in full swing. The old, ruined part the town, formerly known as just Verigris, became known as Old Verdigris . As the miners reached the lower levels, they broke into the Castle of the Twins, awakening the frozen creatures as the air rushed in. Many miners fell. Anguished, they put their wealth together, and made a wish to the Well of Knowledge .</p>
<h3>15 th century DR</h3>
<p>In the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR , barbarians from the Ride raided Verdigris and other nearby settlements of the Moonsea North, such as Ilinvur and Whitehorn , sending thousands of refugees fleeing from their home, seeking shelter and protection in Phlan.</p>
