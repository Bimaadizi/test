<p>Molina's Keep was a ruined fort located in the Valley of Khedrun , that once belonged to the retired adventurers Molina and Kengrin .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The keep was located in the Valley of Khedrun, on the south side of the River Mirar , ninety miles upstream from Mirabar . It was right on the edge of the northern border of the Lurkwood .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>While it still stood, Molina's Keep was a shell keep consisting of a stone wall, supported by wood and masonry, surrounding a courtyard. In the centre of the courtyard was Molina & Kengrin's home. After it was destroyed, all that was left was a pile of charred rubble.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The sorceress Molina and her husband, the warrior Kengrin , settled in this keep shortly after the turn of the 14th century DR following a successful adventuring career. The pair had brought back with them from the astral plane a githyanki silver sword named Diamond-edge . A detachment of the Mindspear Battalion of githyanki were tasked with retrieving the blade and punishing it's thieves. The gith quickly located the sword and set about establishing a lair in the nearby Cinderspire volcano. Once they had established their staging point, their red dragon ally Storm attacked a village near the keep in the mid-1360s DR, while the githyanki themselves snuck into the keep itself, murdered Kengrin, and feebleminded Molina.</p>
