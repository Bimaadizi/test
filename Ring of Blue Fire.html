<p>The Ring of Blue Fire , previously known as the Ring of Gray Flames , was a series of ruined towers found in Rashemen , that dated back to the ancient empire of Raumathar .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The five towers of the ring were set in a circular arrangement each of which was topped with corona of gray flame. Each of the remaining towers emitted strange mechanical sounds and radiated strong magical auras that disrupted the casting of any form of divine magic within a 100 ft (30 m) radius. Additionally, the towers' flames lashed out at anyone that attempted to conjure any extra-planar beings from beyond the borders of Toril .</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , the continual gray flames were transformed into jets of blue fire that erupted sporadically, accompanied by a bright light that shone from within the towers.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The towers were located on the edge of the Endless Wastes , about three day's of travel by horseback east of Mulptan .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , only two of the five towers remained whole and standing.</p>
<p>At some point during or before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , someone recovered the powerful belt of Raumathar from the ruins.</p>
<p>During the Spellplague , in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , the flames erupting from the towers became more intense and changed from their gray color to that of the blue fire associated with the cataclysmic event. They took on the same transformative properties as the blue fire, causing nearby creatures to develop spellscars or even transform into plaguechanged horrors.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Many people believed that the towers were a source of ancient Raumathari battle magic .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The lands surrounding the towers were inhabited by roaming spells that seemed to have a mind and will of their own.</p>
