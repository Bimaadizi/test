<h2>History</h2>
<p>Opal Starlight lived in the city of Ravens Bluff in the Vast , but little was recorded of her life; however, the woman's name graced the pages of the locally popular broadsheet – the Ravens Bluff Trumpeter . Jacinth Moonspring , the Society Editor, connected Opal to a notorious womanizer named Don Juan Montery , who, apart from her, also entangled and frolicked with several other notable women within just a single month: pock-faced Vedina Stareye‎ , a lovely paladin of Tyr , Yvonne Chantel , and the fellow Knight of the Golden Rooster named Ladyhawke .</p>
