<p>Lord Kreskur Mountwyrm was a noble of Cormyr in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Council of the Dragon in late Mirtul of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Kreskur Mountwyrm was the first noble to make his grievances known, and make demands of the Crown. Though he didn't ask for much, what he sought, combined with what every other noble did, would not only gut the Writ , it would have granted them more power than prior to it.</p>
<p>After the Council of the Dragoncame under attack, Kreskur noticed the blueflame ghost attacking. He cried out that it was a new one, strongly implying he knew of the ones that had been spotted before.</p>
