<p>Twisp was a gnome illusionist active during the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Early in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Twisp was being hunted by a revenant which appeared to be a moon elf from Evermeet . As it pursued him through Daggerdale , the spells he employed to try and slow his undead pursuer instead inflicted casualties on the locals. While the Dalesfolk had initially been receptive to Twisp's claims that he was innocent of murdering the revenant, his collateral damage made them less and less sympathetic.</p>
