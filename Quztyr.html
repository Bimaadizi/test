<p>Quztyr was a drow warrior involved in the infiltration of Scornubel in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>On the day of his death, he was disguised as a large, dark-eyed man dressed in abundant gold chains.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He could trigger some hanging mental effects assumed to be placed by Daerdatha on his fellow drow, and even use mental effects of sorts to unrelated people.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He was part of the drow infiltration of Scornubel in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He followed the orders of Daerdatha, the sorceress, and was at least somewhat acquainted with Namra Dunseltree 's imposter. Furthermore, he had the power somehow to send specific mental commands to her, which he believed to be irresistible.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Quztyr was already among the drow infiltrating Scornubel. On that year, he was one of the many drow imposters at the party in Halonder Eldeglut 's home, where he played the part of the lookout after the drugged host and his wife were dragged off to their quarters, presumably for the spells that would grant another drow enough memories and their shapes. However, he discovered the drow impersonating Namra Dunseltree, Anlaervrith Mrantarr , was not responding to his mental commands; he grew suspicious, and indeed, that drow was actually Qilué Veladorn , who had supplanted the actual imposter to infiltrate his own infiltration force.</p>
<p>After the ensuing battle, Quztyr attempted to mind-ream the intruder, but that fried his brain. Daerdatha immediately called on Nuelvar Faeroenel , a fellow drow, to finish him off. Though Nuelvar hesitated, he didn't do so for long, and just killed him.</p>
