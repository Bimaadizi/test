<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Relig possessed a powerful staff of the necromancer (not that one ).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Relig was the head wizard of House Szind, which largely involved mass amounts of necromancy for the house's business interests. During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar, rumors reached the surface of Szind developing new and terrifying undeadâ€”a project spearheaded by Relig. He was working to create a new form of undead that was completely physically and mentally intact, making them indistinguishable from the living while still remaining under the full control of a necromancer. While he had grand promises and seemed to believe them, Relig was unable to reach these goals and was dependent on more traditional necromantic rituals and the house's necromantic cauldrons to make undead of any quality. The Amaunatori priestess Oryne Belamadin considered this to be an unacceptable threat, and so sent a team down disguised as drow to sabotage House Szind and end the threat by any means.</p>
<p>Relig conspired with the apprentice Sarnish and the priestess Silan Szind to kill and reanimate her mother, Matron Zhivsha Szind . While Silan thought she was in charge of the plot, Relig secretly considered himself her master and destined to rule not just House Szind but the whole city as well. When heroes from Cormyr broke into House Szind to ruin his plans, he had his personal guards stand down and welcome them into his ritual chamber, letting the surfacers bask in his glory. Unfortunately for him, even with his guards and undead minions the invaders were able to slay him, putting an end to Szind's fell business.</p>
