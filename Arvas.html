<p>His voice wasn't as deep as Paeregur 's.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He carried a sword and wore a cowl.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Arvas was a member of the Frostfire Banner when they took on High Duke Horostos 's assignment to search for the reason why all animals larger than one's hand, as well as most people, were vanishing on the road between Starmantle and Ripplestones .</p>
<p>They were ambushed on their first night out of Starmantle by a chiming mist, the Slayer . Avras took first watch; when his comrade Paeregur checked up on him, hearing the tinkling bell-like sound, he found Avras had been reduced to a skull and a husk that collapsed into ash at the slightest touch.</p>
