<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Before his death, Horath briefly wielded his father's handaxe called Wolfsbane , albeit unskillfully.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime around 1490 DR, Horath agreed to tend to his friend Jared 's sheep herd outside of Luskan , while Jared himself was happily drinking ale at the Cutlass with Horath's sister. The unlucky shepherd was not informed of the constant threat of wolves in the area. Horath encountered the wolf pack leader, a dire wold the size of a horse , luckily, he brought along his father's enchanted handaxe called the Wolfsbane . In the end, Horath was not proficient in handling weapons and fell to the hungry dire wolf. His final thoughts were that Jared intentionally set him to be killed on that task.</p>
