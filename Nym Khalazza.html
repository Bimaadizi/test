<p>Nym Khalaza was an old drow patron of the Ust Natha tavern who shared tales with his patrons, around 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nym would often be pointed to by other tavern patrons, as he had much to tell. He believed that his failing eyes would cause him to be murdered soon, and that he should be at home, dying. Nym did not fear telling adventurers about deities different to Lolth , as he was old enough not to care any more. He was aware of the presence of the silver dragon Adalon , who was sent by the surfacers to guard a passage between the two groups.</p>
