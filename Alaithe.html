<h2>History</h2>
<p>Alaithe was a maid working for Blandras Nuin in the mid-14 th century. In 1369 DR, her master was sacrificed to Shar and replaced by Auvrarn Labraster wearing his likeness; she soon noticed that he was not really Blandras Nuin, and put kaurdyl in his morning broth, which he smelled. That led him to strangle her and bury her in the garden.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Alaithe was later impersonated by Anastra Syluné Silverhand , who pretended to be her ghost seeking answers out of Auvrarn Labraster. She related an extensive story about having been taken in by Blandras Nuin in her old age after rejecting his affections in youth, when she was beautiful; it may or may not have been true.</p>
