<p>Chu-u , also called legless ghosts , were a race of greater spirits common to Kara-Tur , who were neither wicked nor noble enough in life to be judged in the afterlife .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The upper half of a chu-u appeared as an aged human, either male or female. The bottom half of a chu-u was in a misty cloud of roughly 5 feet (150 centimeters) in width. Its skin was green and wrinkled, and they had narrow eyes. They often appeared wearing clothing, usually red, and with a crown of thorns.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Upon meeting another humanoid, a chu-u began telling the story of its life. This tale described its former life and how it became a chu-u. They pleaded with humanoids to accompany them to the River of Three Routes , so they could testify on their behalf to the dreaded King Judge , who sentenced and delivered punishment to spirits. Afterwards, they were returned to the Material Plane . Since the King Judge would often spend a lengthy time deliberating on the chu-u's fate, often up to 100 years, the traveler rarely, if ever, learned the outcome of their intervention.</p>
<p>If they refused to aid the chu-u, the spirit became enraged and swore vengeance. It then transformed into a mist and was drawn into the ground. The vengeance of a chu-u occurred when the victim least expected it, often several years later. The chu-u transformed its arm into misty tendrils, which could be lengthened an unlimited distance, and choked their victims. This attack could be repelled by a dispel magic spell. Someone who had been cursed by a chu-u was able to have the curse lifted by visiting a shugenja , who performed a purification ritual.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Chu-u used ghost light to lure travelers to them. They also could drain health from a victim to strengthen themselves.</p>
<p>It was not possible for a chu-u to pass through jade or crystal , nor could it pick items made from these materials up.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Chu-u spent their time stuck along the shores of the River of Three Routes, unable to fully enter the Spirit World . On the Prime Material plane, they remained underground until they encountered a humanoid.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>The tears of a chu-u were collected and used by wu jen and shugenja as the main component in oil of etherealness .</p>
