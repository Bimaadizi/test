Subsequently, Rawleigh, along with other family members, took over Gallaway Trading Coaster after Rawleigh's father, Ilmus Gallaway , was unable to be in charge due to his age and love of Cormyrian brandy . In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , Rawleigh still ran the family business. As a "one last favor," Rawleigh requested his trusted adviser and employee, Jemeliah , to lend his expertise and sharp mind to Deirdre Gallaway in Targos , who strove to prove herself as a capable businesswoman and merchant.</p>
