<p>Acamar was a star-like entity from the Far Realm who had taken a place among stars of Realmspace . Unlike normal stars, Acamar didn't have a fixed place in the sky but instead danced and wavered across Realmspace.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Acamar was a dead star of utterly black inky nothingness that ate other celestial bodies that drew too close to it.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Acamar and the other Far Realmâ€“infested stars of Realmspace were somehow related to the Eldest .</p>
<p>Acamar's hunger was endless, and when its influence on Toril was at its peak, it sent its agents, the Maws of Acamar , to devour everything they encountered in their path to sate the hunger of the dead star.</p>
<p>Acamar was usually sought out by some warlocks to make a pact with it. Neogi were one race that had made a pact with it and the other Far Realm-infested stars.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Acamar was one of the stars the warlock Japheth Donard sought out in 1396 DR , after losing his pact with the archfey Neifion .</p>
<p>In 1492 DR , Acamar, posing as an imaginary lover, taunted Skrianna Shadowdusk .</p>
