<p>Kurplarhagoon was the kuo-toa leader of the Blib-sanvu in Sloopdilmonpolop in 1370 DR . and 1372</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, Kurplarhagoon had succumbed to the madness that affected most of the kuo-toa of Sloopdilmonpolop. His insanity manifested as a limited monomania, producing an obsessive fixation on certain individuals he believed were violent or insane.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kurplarhagoon was the leader of the elite Blib-sanvu, an elite order of celibate kuo-toa monitors. His duty was to control and eventually suppress all violent or insane kuo-toa in the city. His own insanity, however, caused the Blib-sanvu to sometimes spend months hunting individuals who were possibly no longer even in the city, while ignoring dangerously insane kuo-toa currently in the city.</p>
