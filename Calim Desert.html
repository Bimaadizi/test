<p>The Calim Desert , also known as the Skyfire Wastes , was a rocky desert on the coast in the country of Calimshan . It was not formed by natural means, instead being the result of an epic magical war between two genies , the djinni Calim and efreeti Memnon . The sands hid the ruins of ancient cities, which were said to hold many treasures.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Calim Desert dominated the western half of Calimshan. The desert was contained to the east by the mighty Calim River . Counterclockwise from north to south, the desert was also bordered by the River Agis , the Trackless Sea , and the Shining Sea . The desert was roughly 100 feet below sea level, sloping at a gradual decline from the coast over 10 miles.</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>The Calim Desert was primarily a level and rocky salt flat , yet the magical effects of Calim and Memnon could change that. These often dangerous manifestations of the two genies were called "Calim's Breath" and "Memnon's Crackle" . The former was the cause of frequent sandstorms and whirlwinds; the latter the cause of earthquakes or the creation of patches of hot sand. The highly-porous worm rock could be found around the Calim Desert.</p>
<h3>Flora and Fauna</h3>
<p>Small rodents and reptiles were a few of the animals who had adapted to life in this desert. Most lived among the ruins of ancient cities. Also numerous were arachnids and insects, rabbits, weasels, toads, and vultures.</p>
<p>The largest creatures lived below the sands; desert purple worms frequented the area, and unlike typical purple worms, they lived in groups.</p>
<p>The Calim cactus was one of the few plants able to adapt to the changing and dry surface of the Calim desert. These strange plants were the primary food source for many of the animals listed above.</p>
<h2>Trade and Travel</h2>
<p>The Trade Way cut directly across the Calim Desert from Calimport to Memnon . The only reason it had continued to exist at all over centuries of Memnon's crackling was due to the magical minarets erected along the road by the Shoon Imperium .</p>
<p>One could also travel around the desert along the Coast Trail , but this was neither safe nor well-traveled.</p>
<p>By 1370 DR , the Twisted Rune had placed a magical gate in the desert to allow for instantaneous movement to other locations.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In long ages past, the lands that later became the Calim Desert were lush farmland, a portion of which were known as the Teshyllal Fields . The cities of Dashadjen and Teshyll were located here during the Calim Empire .</p>
<p>The desert's creation began in −6100 DR , when the elven high mage Pharos trapped the bodies of Calim and Memnon in the Calimemnon Crystal . Since that time, their consciousnesses had continued to war against each other, and their magical manifestations in the air and in the ground formed and maintained the desert.</p>
<p>It was estimated that if Calim and Memnon were ever released—which did in fact occur during the Spellplague —the desert would take 800 to 1,000 years to return to the terrain it once was.</p>
<p>In the Year of Holy Thunder, 1450 DR , the desert was frozen over for months while vassals of Auril fought against the efreet and genies of Calimshan.</p>
<h2>Legends</h2>
<p>Every year on Ches 4 , locals claimed that the night winds howled with the sound of the hundreds of trapped genies within the Calimemnon Crystal, as that day was the anniversary of their entrapment.</p>
