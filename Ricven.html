<p>Ricven was an archmage of Neverwinter during the late 14 th century DR . He perished during the events of the Spellplague , but his spirit languished on the Prime Material plane for nearly a century after his death.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ricven was a member of the Many-Starred Cloak mage's guild in Neverwinter, whose guild tower was torn apart during the Spellplague in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR . Ricven and his fellow mages died as they fell into the heart of their collapsing tower.</p>
<p>Thereafter, Ricven and his colleagues existed as "shadows of our former selves", as he put it. For almost a hundred years, Rivcen did not pass on to the Fugue Plane , but remained on Toril as a ghost tethered to the spot of his death in a chamber full of bones and dust buried beneath the ruined tower.</p>
<p>Occasionally, people such as one too-curious dwarf fell into the column of blue fire at the heart of the tower and found themselves face to face with Ricven in the buried chamber; he usually just answered their questions and sent them back. In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , a wizard adventurer jumped, or fell, into the column and met Ricven, who taught them how to cast the pre-Spellplague spell ghost sound and showed locations in the city where enough of the Weave remained intact to cast. Their colleague Lugan was impressed and wish to study the cantrip and Weave locations further.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As a portion of the Weave remained intact at the ruined arcane tower, Rivcen was able to still perform magic as it was before the Spellplague.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Astonishingly, Ricven had not been driven insane, like so many others who remained connected to pre-Spellplague magic. He mostly just seemed bored with waiting to move on.</p>
