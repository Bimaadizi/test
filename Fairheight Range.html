<p>The Fairheight Range , which were also called the Fairheight Mountains were a range of mountains along the northern border of the kingdom of Callidyrr on the island of Alaron in the Moonshaes .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Fairheights overlooked Whitefish Bay to the east and separated the southern lands of the Ffolk from the northern kingdom of Gnarhelm belonging to the Northmen . They were mined by both peoples and contained rich deposits of iron and precious metals including gold and silver as well as copper .</p>
<h2>Climate</h2>
<p>The mountain range served as a natural windbreak that kept the storms from the Trackless Sea confined to Gnarhelm, resulting in skies that were often overcast and rainy. Consequently, the weather in Callidyrr was usually more pleasant, perhaps further adding to the annoyance felt by the Northmen against their southern neighbors.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The highlands of the Fairheights were infested with trolls that attacked those who were foolish enough to journey over the passes alone or in small numbers. Orcs and goblins from the mountains sometimes carried out raids against the mining towns along the foothills, but these settlements were not defenseless since they were protected by militias.</p>
