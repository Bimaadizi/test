<p>The Chokemist Cave was home to one of the last colonies of chokemist plants in Samarach as of the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The cave stood to the north of the Snout of Omgar in the jungles of Samarach. The entrance into the deadly abyss was an opening in the northern side of a low but rocky mountain. Strange green mist bellowed rhythmically from the cave's entrance.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The cave was filled with toxic clouds of green spores, a type of deadly poison produced by chokemist plants. The plants resembled thick, twisting, woody roots with strange blossoming green flowers. The poised poison-filled cave was home to a colony of corrupted giant spiders , addicted and withered by the swirling spores.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the Chokemist Cave was used as a base by a yuan-ti pureblood infiltrator named Luaire Farwander who covertly sabotaged merchant operations of one of the merchant companies of Samargol . Luaire kept the addicted giant spiders as his pets and used chokemist to poison the artificer operator of a hidden Lantanese portal .</p>
