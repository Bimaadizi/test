<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , an army assembled by the Cult of the Absolute moved from the Moonrise Towers in Chionthar Valley to menace the city of Baldur's Gate , displacing countless refugees in the process along the way. Farmer Zakk and his husband fled to the nearby city of Baldur's Gate with a few of their surviving cows . Sadly, if the spouses were to be given access to the city within the walls, the cows would be confiscated by the Flaming Fist mercenaries upon entry to be slaughtered due to ration shortage in the city. Zakk was granted entrance to the Lower City of Baldur's Gate, while his husband the cattle stayed in Rivington . Zakk lamented the prospect of loosing their cows â€“ their only livelihood and joined the protesting farmers by the Basilisk Gate.</p>
