<p>Moonveil Citadel was a glass fortress in Sildëyuir , and one of the premier mansions in the realm. Kiril Duskmourn had visited the citadel while she was young.</p>
<p>When she returned to Sildëyuir in winter of 1375 DR , she arrived in time to watch it burn and collapse in front of her. There were a dozen corpses, some of which she recognized, in front of the fire; all of them had their eyes plucked.</p>
<p>Tower Aerilpe was close to Moonveil Citadel.</p>
