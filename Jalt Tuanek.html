<p>Lord Jalt Tuanek was a dragonborn of Tymanther , the former patriarch of Clan Jalt , and the lord of Ruinspoke in 1480 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Lord Tuanek was level-headed and firm, but kind. He didn't like mercenaries and adventurers , because of their shifting loyalties, but he knew that they were needed in a frontier place like Ruinspoke.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Some years before 1479 DR , Lord Tuanek stepped down from his position as the elder of clan Jalt. He became the lord of Ruinspoke as his "retirement". There, he trained the new generation while dealing with Ruinspoke's day-to-day government.</p>
<p>Lord Tuanek usually hired adventurers to deal with monster problems, to help Ruinspoke citizens, or to explore nearby Untheran ruins.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1479 DR, Lord Tuanek began to recruit more adventuring bands than usual because of the kobold tribes inhabiting the outlying areas, that had become bolder and attacked the nearby farms.</p>
