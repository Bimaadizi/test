<p>The Will-o'-wisp language was an entirely optical language used by will-o'-wisps , Nyths , and variants found in the Domains of Dread , such as will o'deeps and will o'seas .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Described by some as merely a "flickering light" language, will-o'-wisps and its other "speakers" conveyed ideas through changing the color and or the brightness or intensity of their light-based bodies.</p>
<p>The alien and subtle nature of this language made it largely incomprehensible to the average human , demihuman , and most other creatures. It was considered by many to be impossible to mimic, though some swamp-based druids managed to somewhat communicate in the language through the use of light sources, such as a hooded lantern .</p>
