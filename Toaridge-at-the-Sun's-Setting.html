<p>Toaridge-at-the-Sun's-Setting was an island in the Sea of Swords off the coast of the Western Heartlands .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Toaridge-at-the-Sun's-Setting was about 275 to 300 miles (440 to 485 kilometers) west-southwest of Candlekeep . It was north of the Nelanther Isles , or was the northernmost island in that chain, the difference mainly depended on how the map was labeled.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This island played an important role in the history of a powerful magic sword known as Taragarth "the Bloodbrand". Aeroth , the hero of the Second Trollwar and wielder of Taragarth , departed Silverymoon for the Moonshae Isles after the death of his liege lord Rayuth in the Year of the Scythe, 982 DR . On the way, he stopped at Toaridge-at-the-Sun's-Setting and hid the famous sword in an abandoned well so his six sons would not squabble over it. The Bloodbrand laid there for centuries until it was discovered by a band of illithids and carried off to their home base deep underground on the mainland.</p>
