<p>Jazayir al-Sartan , the Isles of the Crab , formed a crab-shaped archipelago in the eastern part of the Crowded Sea of Zakhara , south of Ajayib . Poorly explored and marginally settled by enlightened Zakharans, it was the home to a large number of monsters as well as savage tribes of halflings , humans , ogres and ogre magi . Even the waters were avoided due the strange crab-like monsters .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Four major groups of islands were usually recognized within the archipelago: the larger Jazirat al-Sadaf (the "Island of the Shell") and Jazirat al-Qraidis ("Shrimp Island"), the long chain called Jazayir al-Alfar (the "Islands of the Claws") extending north and south of Jaziat al-Sadaf, and the smaller Uyun al-Sartan ("Eyes of the Crab") in the center around the so-called Batihat al-Saji , the "Lagoon of the Brave".</p>
