<p>Castle Endreth was a crumbling ruin near Starmantle . It was used by the Magister Talatha Vaerovree as a refuge .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The keep was near Starmantle .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>It was a roofless heap by the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , with extensive, leaky cellars reached by a long, descending hallway.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The hallway to the cellars was extensive and powerfully trapped. The spells still shielding it acted as a shield against anything not being wielded by a living creature, reflected all lightning bolt -related spells directly back at their target, and had a quickly alternating reverse gravity trap that continuously dropped anyone not thinking the correct password 20 feet (6.1 meters) back and forth between floor and ceiling. Talatha kept a stone of magic missiles hidden along the passageway.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>In the cellars, Talatha Vaerovree kept six potions of extra healing in silvered steel vials, a potion of vitality in a silver vial and an elixir of health in a red-painted steel vial. They were all hidden in a chest underneath a pool of water opaque with sediment.</p>
<p>Weavespinners had orders to regularly scour the ruin of monsters.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The castle was named after the warrior who built it. The structure was shown by Azuth to Talatha Vaerovree as a good place to lose pursuers and rest.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The castle found itself inhabited by kobolds , trolls , or perytons from time to time, only to be cleared by weavespinners sent by that purpose.</p>
