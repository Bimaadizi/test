<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Ash'ala was her family's representative for an alliance with House Xorlarrin and Bregan D'aerthe in handling a party of adventurers . They first sent the team to collection magical power for Lolth's scheme to create a Demon Weave . For the expedition, she asked adventurers loyal to her house to perform a holy ritual in the outpost that was the objective of the mission. The ritual cleansed an altar to guard against taint from the Xorlarrin or Bregan D'aerthe drow.</p>
<p>After the adventurers returned from their first mission, Hoshtar Xorlarrin was invited to meet with members of the Council of Spiders by his cousin, Raelaryn Xorlarrin . At the meeting, a Jaezred Chaulssin assassin killed Raelaryn and captured Hoshtar. The alliance's hired team managed to rescue him. Regardless of the alliance's decision on how to deal with the civil war, it was unanimous in sending adventurers to eliminate the leader of the assassins . However, Ash'ala wanted to know if Hoshtar had willingly met the heretics of the Council of Spiders.</p>
<p>In the Year of Dwarvenkind Reborn, 1488 DR , Ash'ala together with the upper ranks of her House attended her matron mother Zhindia Melarn 's meeting with Shakti Hunzrin to plot the capture or killing of Drizzt and Zaknafein Do'Urden .</p>
<p>However, secretly supporting her mother Kyrnill against Zhindia, Ash'ala spied on her own House, divulging information to Bregan D'aerthe . But after the last meeting with Kimmuriel Oblodra , Ash'ala was unveiled and captured by Zhindia, who sentenced her to a terrible torture: to be devoured by maggots . Thereafter, she was considered dead. However, in the Year of the Star Walker's Return, 1490 DR , there was a meeting between Zhindia and Kyrnill at which the yochlol Yiccardaria had Ash'ala tethered by a spiked collar and constantly tugged at it to draw out little yelps of pain.</p>
