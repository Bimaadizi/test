<p>Garick Honestone was an undertaker and barber who lived in Daggerford circa the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As a devout follower of Garl Glittergold , Garick was ironically not allowed to shave his own beard.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He had a wife named Ranna and a daughter called Hunnett .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Garick first arrived in town, he started an undertaker's service, called "The Fallen Man", in a two-story building with his apartment on the upper floor. However, the death rate in town did not generate much business.</p>
<p>He was curious about why many humans shaved their beards, so he tried shaving a cadaver for the experience. He enjoyed it and found he had a knack for shaving other people, so he split his shop into two equal parts and began to offer a barber service in the other half. His great skill with the straight razor brought humans and gnomes to his barber shop, The Clean Chin , to have their beards or heads shaved.</p>
<p>After Garick passed away, his daughter Hunnett took over the family business.</p>
