<p>The Wall of the Faithless was the wall surrounding the City of Judgment on the Fugue Plane , according to the World Tree cosmology , or surrounding the City of the Dead in the Oinos layer of Hades , according to the Great Wheel cosmology .</p>
<p>When faithful mortals died, they could petition their respective gods for entry to their plane of influence. However, the faithless were absorbed into the Wall and wholly became a part of it.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Wall of the Faithless was made of a green, supernatural mold that cemented the souls of the Faithless, dissolving them until they were destroyed. This was a painful process, and the souls were completely conscious and aware during the whole process.</p>
<p>However, the Wall of the Faithless seems to have been changed in the years following the Spellplague , and, as of as of 1479 DR , the Wall was described as a place where souls were condemned to an "eternity of utter boredom", rather than being a place of eternal torment.</p>
<p>Those who examined the Wall of the Faithless could see the faces and skulls of the countless souls absorbed into the very fabric of the wall.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Wall of the Faithless was erected by Myrkul to punish the souls of beings who claimed no patron god . The laws established for the treatment of the faithless were ratified by the Circle of Greater Powers of Myrkul's time.</p>
<p>His successor Cyric kept the Wall erected largely out of malice and sadism, never questioning its existence as long as it served as a means to issue torment and suffering.</p>
<p>With Cyric's fall, Kelemvor ascended to the portfolio of the dead and struck down the Wall alongside a myriad of other changes to the Fugue Plane , intending to enact a more "fair" accounting of the Faithless. Following Kelemvor's abandonment of his humanity after it was determined he had overstepped his bounds, Kelemvor reconsidered his perspective and reinstated the Wall under the argument that mortals needed to be held accountable for their faith, to prevent the gods from forgetting their duties and taking revenge on mortals.</p>
<p>The Wall of the Faithless was still the final destination for the souls of the faithless as of 1479 DR, as confirmed by Duvan , when a demon tempted him offering salvation from his intended destiny as a brick on Kelemvor's wall when he died while exploring the Plaguewrought Lands .</p>
<p>However, during the events surrounding the rise of the cult of the Absolute in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Jergal stated that the Faithless were instead condemned to wander the Fugue Plane eternally.</p>
