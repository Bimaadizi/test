<p>Orc-Slayer was an enchanted short sword that belonged to Harpo Bogglinn , a hin prince, in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Orc-Slayer blade was ensorcelled to be effective when used against orcs and orckind. When the blade was near an orc, within 50 feet (15 meters), the sword shivered as if eagerly excited to shed some orc and orog blood. When used in battle against orckind, the Orc-Slayer's formidable +2 enchantment became a powerful +4 magic that guided the wielder's hand towards the orcish opponents. Each strike against such enemies had its damage magically doubled.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid–14 th century DR, Price Harpo Bogglinn was exiled from Toril by his father. To redeem himself and return home, the halfling waged a one-hin war against orcs. The Orc-Slayer blade had been used to end the lives of one thousand and one orcs.</p>
