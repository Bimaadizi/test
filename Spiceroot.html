<p>Spiceroot was a root used in cooking on the Sword Coast North . It was gathered in Neverwinter Wood and was notable for its spicy taste.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , Jingo Rummage , a halfling adventurer , gathered forest herbs in Neverwinter Wood when his companion Jodri was eaten by wild wolf-men. As revenge, Jingo asked a group of Neverwintan adventurers to gather umber leaves , spotted mushrooms , and spiceroots to add them to the wolves' cooking pots. The aroma attracted hungry ogres to the camp, who, in turn, slaughtered the beast-men.</p>
