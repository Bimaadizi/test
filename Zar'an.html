<p>Raider Zar'an was a githyanki guard from Crèche Y'llek , on Toril during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Zar'an had a gaunt gith body and golden-colored hair. She wore little armor, just a pair of githyanki metal bracers and a cauldron while carrying a githyanki-crafted crossbow .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Raider Zar'an, along with other gith of what would become Crèche Y'llek, attacked and claimed the Rosymorn Monastery of Lathander in the Western Heartlands of West Faerûn sometime before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . Soon after, the function of Crèche was changed as the githyanki war against the mind flayers in Faerûn shifted in balance. Zar'an stood guard in the Crèche's hatchery but was more welcoming to outsiders than most of her kin.</p>
