<p>Thar , also known as the Great Gray Land , was a rocky, broken moor stretching for hundreds of miles with a harsh climate in the Moonsea North region, beyond the eponymous Moonsea lake. It was inhabited by wild tribes of humanoids such as orcs and ogres that were constantly at war with one another.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The vast steppes of Thar were bleak and barren, that was considered by many to be wholly uninhabitable. While the rough and hard terrain made it difficult to effectively settle, it also offered resiliency against some of its more savage and destructive inhabitants.</p>
<h3>Climate</h3>
<p>Thar was bleak and windy, and was highly unsuitable for growing crops.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It was situated partly within and continued west of the Cold Lands , along the northern shores of the Moonsea Lake, between the Galena and Dragonspine Mountains .</p>
<p>The Glister Road the only true pathway that cut through the land of Thar.</p>

<p>While large prey animals such as deer were not common in Thar, many smaller rodents such as mice , voles , and rabbits thrived in its grasslands. Above them in the food chain were smaller predators such as foxes and wolves , along with predatory birds like kestrels , shrikes , falcons , and the magnificent steppe eagle .</p>
<p>It was the home of the Tharurr breed of horse , the name meaning "Thar's horse" in the giant language .</p>

<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Despite its reputation as a dismal wasteland, a number of important caravan routes crisscrossed across the plains of Thar. Adventurers, scouts, and guides were regularly found accompanying these caravans to ensure safe passage.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>From −981 DR to Year of Craven Words, −350 DR , the region that would eventually be known as Thar was part of the minotaur kingdom of Grong-Haap , ruled by Haask, Voice of Hargut , during which time the region enjoyed a comparatively high level of civilization.</p>
<p>Later, Vorbyx founded the ogre kingdom of Thar.</p>
<p>The Tharkuls of the realm, referred to by outsiders as ogre-kings, would continue to rule over the land for nearly 1500 years.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Blue Shield, 400 DR , the Dark Alliance of malevolent humanoids from Thar attacked and destroyed Northkeep , sinking it below the waves of the Moonsea .</p>
<p>The elven archmage Abarat began construction of his ivory tower in Thar during the Year of the Brutal Beast, 669 DR , with the hopes that it would serve as a bulwark against the malevolent forces of the lands beyond.</p>
<p>The terrible Battle of the Masks brought out on the plains of Thar in the Year of the Vigilant Fist, 1259 DR , between the Masked Wizards of Ankhalus and the Zhentilar .</p>
<p>The human kingdom of Thar was established in the Year of the Roaring Horn, 1288 DR , when Beldoran slew Maulog the last Tharkul of the ogre kingdom of Thar. The human kingdom fell after a mere 15 years, in the Year of the Evening Sun, 1303 DR , after an army of ogres threatening the Citadel of the Raven were re-routed to sack Phlan by the Zhentilar .</p>
<p>When the Flight of Dragons occurred in the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR , many rampaging dragons flew south from Thar and wreaked havoc on the lands of the Moonsea.</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, the lich Aesperus controlled the undead of eastern Thar. Around that same time, the orog warlord Larga Bloodhand rose to some level of prominence, at least until she angered the red dragon Throstulgrael and became stranded by her minions.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Legends stated that the great lost kingdom of ogres was formed by the legendary Vorbyx, who united many tribes together and enslaved the land's orc population. He was said to have a legendary hammer that bestowed upon him profound wisdom and keen intellect.</p>

<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The many humanoid tribes of Thar carried out attacks on caravans heading to or from Glister , the camps in the Galenas foothills, or villages in the Stojanow Vale . In an attempt to keep them in check and bring stability to the area, lords and merchants were known to enter into agreements with the tribes to encourage them not to attack, but these agreements broke down easily. Scouts, hired adventuring companies, and the barbarians of the Ride also ventured into Thar to hunt these tribes and destroy any creatures they encountered.</p>
<p>Ogre tribes in Thar were named after aspects of their ancient kingdom, such as the Jade Skull , Falling Star , and Crystal Sphere tribes. Prominent orc tribes included the Skullsmashers , Red Claws , the Kossuth -worshiping Burning Daggers , Manslayers , and Black Spears .</p>
