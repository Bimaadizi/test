<p>Morven Vance was a rogue member of the Cult of the Dragon on the Dragon Coast in 1374 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Morven was a cleric of the dragon god of secrets, Kalzareinad , and a disciple of Maldraedior in Unther .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1374 DR, she was approached by the young and ambitious member of the Cult of the Dragon Reveilaein Brant , who had found inside the Well of Dragons a tablet artifact describing a ritual to turn a half-dragon into a special kind of dracolich called a kaemundar . However, Reveilaein needed a cleric of Kalzareinad to complete the ritual and requested Morven join him. Morven agreed, planning to maybe betray Reveilaein later.</p>
<p>Later, Reveilaein and Morven gathered a retinue of cultists around them and founded a new cell of the Cult of the Dragon on the Dragon Coast, planning to use the ritual upon the local dragon turtles . The group settled in an abandoned lighthouse in the area between Teziir and Westgate . They recruited a local wyrmling green dragon called Eldrisithain and more importantly the dragon turtle Tsenshivah , to whom Reveilaein promised the power to kill the local fishermen who had killed her mate.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Morven was somewhat craven; she was totally devoted to her god but did not trust her capacities. Due to this, she never challenged Reveilaein. Morven wanted to performed the ritual upon herself one day but she probably needed to be pushed by someone else in order to act</p>
