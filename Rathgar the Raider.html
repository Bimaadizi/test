<p>Rathgar the Raider was a man who conquered and seized control of the kingdom of Doegan in the Utter East during the time of the Bloodforge Wars ( 648 â€“ 657 DR ).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Rathgar the Raider led a band of warriors who overran Doegan and laid siege to the capital . To pacify his own poor clansmen, Rathgar plundered the realm of its bounty, and became known as the "scourge of north lands". Finally, he came for the crown itself, and confronted the king and princess in their own throne room. However, with his dying breath, the defiant king cursed him, declaring "For so long as you rule, a curse upon you. The dead will arise, to ensure your demise."</p>
<p>However, Rathgar paid no heed to the curse, until, months later, a captured criminal, a graverobber called Grubkern , whispered of a gathering army of undead coming to rid Doegan of the invaders. As fear spread in the capital, Rathgar determined to investigate, threatening to kill Grubkern if he'd spoken falsely. Escaping the invaders, the princess of Doegan had looked for a way to make her father's prophecy come true, at last enlisting the aid Aelric at Old Stone Keep .</p>
<p>The Howl of Vengeance conflict was fought between the two factions using bloodforges .</p>
