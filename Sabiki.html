<p>A sabiki was a Kozakuran fishing device.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A sabiki rig consisted of a set of multiple hooked lines with a single lure and sinker. It was developed by Kozakuran fishermen for catching oceanic baitfish.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originating in Kozakura, the sabiki eventually found its way to northwest Faer√ªn by the 15 th century DR , where it proved especially adept at snaring candlefish and clumps of marimo . Fishing contest organizers found its use unfair, given the amount of hooks involved.</p>
