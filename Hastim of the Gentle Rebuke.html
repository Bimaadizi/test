<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 714 DR , Hastim was a part of the Army of Darkness that breached the defenses of Myth Drannor and spilled into the city. Hastim attacked Jerrok's Concert Hall that was located in the Cormanthyr district of Myth Drannor, not far from Castle Cormanthor . The bards inside the Concert Hall were weaving a grand defense spell as the yugoloth slipped through not-yet-solid barriers around the structure. Hastim of the Gentle Rebuke started slaughtering the bards who were in the middle of the spell as it backfired on everyone inside the Concert Hall, turning the bards and the yugoloth to stone.</p>
<p>In 1369 DR , Hastim of the Gentle Rebuke along with the bards were still inside ruined Jerrok's Concert Hall in their petrified state, as the bard statues continues holding the notes of the spell-songs.</p>
