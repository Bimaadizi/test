<p>Hammer of thunderous blows was a powerful enchanted maul created sometime before the late 15 th century DR and broken apart in later years.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hammers of thunderous blows were crafted out of high-quality steel and polished to shine and reflect like the finest of mirrors .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A hammer of thunderous blows possessed a potent +3 enchantment that made the bludgeon much more deadly and guided it toward the target. Each weapon's swing was as powerful as a thunderclap and had a chance of knocking its targets prone.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the first of these weapons was first created was unknown. However, one hammer of thunderous blows might have been reforged by a master smith of Luskan in the late 15 th century DR, for a low fee of 8,000 gp , using a magic ominous gem , discovered in the Forlorn Cliffs of the Underdark ; an ancient broken shaft; and its broken hammer head, found in the duergar city of Grackslugh .</p>
