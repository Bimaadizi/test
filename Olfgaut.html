<h2>History</h2>
<p>Olfgaut agreed with his father's fateful decision to declare Norland's independence from High King Derid Kendrick .</p>
<p>Given that Olfgaut was already an old man in 1479Â DR , he believed his son should be the next Jarl of Norland. However, the Storm Maiden 's recent rise to power hindered his plans since he knew she would soon challenge the Jarl of Norland to lead the Northlanders of the island. Olfgaut knew his son stood no chance against the Storm Maiden in combat, so he planned to have assassins take her out the next time she visited Stormbanner Hold .</p>
<p>Olfgaut was killed during the ensuing conflict with the Storm Maiden. Both he and his son were dead by the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR .</p>
