<p>The Citadel of Ice and Steel was the center of all major djinni activity within the Elemental Plane of Air .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This citadel was actually a gigantic chunk of elemental ice and earth , smoothed over time by the winds into a nearly perfect oval. The Great Caliph's palace was located in the center.</p>
<p>The entire citadel was constantly free-falling, based on the caliph's will. Thus, the only kind of movement possible within the citadel was flight.</p>
<p>Any creature incapable of flight or hovering was constantly buffeted by wind from djinn guards while they were in audience with the Great Caliph.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The Great Caliph and his court issued decrees and collected taxes, but the citadel did not produce tangible products.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The noble djinn had several elite military organizations that they could call upon if the Court of Ice and Steel was threatened, including:</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Djinn and noble djinn , along with elemental servants of air inhabited the citadel.</p>
<h2>Rumors and Legends</h2>
<p>The djinn claimed to have overthrown Imix , the Prince of Elemental Evil, and claimed the citadel for their own.</p>
