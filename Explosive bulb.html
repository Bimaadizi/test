<p>An explosive bulb was an alchemical device known in the late 14 th century DR . It was a bulb, warm to the touch, and if dashed against a hard surface, it would break and then explode. They were powerful enough explosives to hurl a careless user far away if they were too close, and generated enough heat to set alight flammables in the area. They were considerably more expensive than a tenday 's stay at a festhall . The thief Gage from Laothkund was known to use them, as of 1375Â DR .</p>
