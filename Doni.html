<p>Doni was a tiefling child who was among those outcast from the city of Elturel in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Doni had gray-black hair he kept cropped short, and two smaller horns that jut upwards. He dressed in simple hide clothes, tied together at his waist with a single cord.</p>
<p>He seemed unable or unwilling to speak, rather communicating by means of grunts and gestures.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As a member of Mol 's gang, Doni acted as a pickpocket and thief. He would distract passersby by gazing past them, with the hopes they would turn their attention away from him. Once they did, Doni pilfered whatever goods he could from their pockets or bags.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the tieflings of Elturel were exiled from the city in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , many of their numbers ventured westward towards Baldur's Gate , under the leadership of the Hellrider officer Zevlor . It was during that journey that Doni and several other children fell under the sway of Mol, a young criminal mastermind. They founded a little hideaway within the Emerald Grove ― a site that offered refuge to the Elturelian tieflings — and orchestrated a series of thefts and crimes from within.</p>
