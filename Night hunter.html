<p>A night hunter (sometimes spelled nighthunter ), also commonly known as a dragazhar , was a type of deep bat that hunted in packs.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Dragazhars were bat-like animals with 7‑foot (2.1‑meter) wingspans and long tails with triangular barbs. They were nocturnal creatures of medium to high intelligence that survived on a carnivorous diet. They were very dark in appearance with velvety black fur, but with bright orange, red, or violet eyes. They had weird, bird-like calls.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>They were known to be vicious. Equipped with infravision to a range of 180 feet (roughly 55 meters), night hunter groups (often called "swoops") raked at their prey with their claws, or with their ultra-sharp tails. They were known for frequently stalking and ambushing their prey, advancing from behind stalagmites or other obstacles they might use to conceal themselves.</p>
<p>During rest, dragazhars would roost with their heads pointed to the ground. They were known to scream maniacally when experiencing excitement.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>When attacking, whether in search of prey or defensively, night hunter swoops would bite their victims or strike with their wing claws. They also frequently made use of their triangular tails to stab or slash at foes. Their primary tactic was to terrorize their opponents with their horrific screams.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>They often travelled in hunting groups of about ten individuals in order to hunt for small creatures, although they would feed on carrion if necessary. In desperate situations, these deep bats were known to attack livestock, humans , and even drow .</p>
<p>Night hunters liked to dwell in dark places, and lived in lairs usually containing over thirty of the creatures. These lairs were usually located underground, such as in the Underdark or in caves. However, if above ground, they preferred to live in dense woods.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The name "dragazhar" comes from the name of the first adventurer to keep a night hunter as a pet. They were popular as familiars among drow wizards .</p>
