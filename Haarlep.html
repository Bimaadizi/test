<p>Haarlep was an incubus at the House of Hope in the Nine Hells , in service to Raphael the cambion .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Haarlep was an incubus shapeshifted to resemble Raphael, Master of the House of Hope. However, instead of being a perfect copy of Raphael's true form, he was noticeably younger. As befitting his kind, Haarlep was a lascivious and seductive creature, using charm and guile to get his way. Even Raphael, who was highly charismatic himself, could not hide or deny anything from him. However, when charisma failed, he had no qualms about resorting to lethal violence.</p>
<p>He dressed in a skimpy leather , spike-studded getup that bared most of his red skin. The leather harness around his chest was inscribed with glowing red Infernal runes. He was able to take male and female forms.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Haarlep was the personal incubus of Raphael, and his lover. He satisfied both Raphael's ego by taking his form and his carnal urges by laying with him. However, Haarlep was actually sent to Raphael by Raphael's father Mephistopheles , and his true loyalties may have belonged with the archdevil rather than his son. Mephistopheles tasked Haarlep with distracting Raphael from some unknown task. According to Haarlep, Raphael was a rather unsatisfying lover.</p>
<p>As Raphael's lover and Mephistopheles's subordinate, Haarlep was nominally on the side of both devils. He acted as a guardian of sorts for the Orphic Hammer , a powerful artifact that remained in Raphael's possession.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Haarlep was instructed by the archdevil Mephistopheles to keep his son, Raphael, distracted. In order to achieve this, the incubus used their wiles and shapeshifting abilities to turn his new master's arrogance against him.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>If engaged, Haarlep summoned imps to fight alongside him and used his charm to turn friend against foe.</p>
