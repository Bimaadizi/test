<p>The Eveningstar War Hospital was a large field hospital in Eveningstar set up to treat the wounded from the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The building was on the west side of Eveningstar, facing east. When the village was barricaded up in response to the drow attacks, it became an anchor point of the western wall.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The hospital was a very large residence with an upper level and inner courtyard.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The War Hospital was administered by a group of Amaunatori priests. The head priest was the venerable Hurim Jaskyr , and among his team were the healers Delethir Mistveil , Eolynn Arva , Meena Follakin , and Jono Branton .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Outbreak</h3>
<p>The hospital was created in response to the sudden attack of Sschindylryn 's drow armies in the mid-1480s DR, and was formerly a large home. It nearly came to ruin when the ranger Peron Uthe arrived for treatment, as he had been infected with a strange disease by the druid Halsaime when he visited Thorngap and began passing it to other patients. Those who progressed to the second stage were transformed into red musk zombies , though they were unable to transmit the disease like Peron. The zombies were joined by malevolent wisps , mudmen , and vine horrors , and thick choking vegetation began growing throughout the hospital.</p>
<p>When they realized what was happening, Hurim Jaskyr had Peron blocked into the west wing of the hospital and sent for aid. Meena Follakin located a team of adventurers who proceeded to cut their way through the hospital, treated the surviving patients, and recovered samples from the fallen Mikhael Jarvin and Aeron Leifbrand , allowing Hurim to create an inoculation against Peron Uthe's infection. Guarded against the disease, the adventurers were able to face Peron and put an end to him, saving the hospital.</p>
<h3>Murder by Night</h3>
<p>The hospital was threatened a second time when several Purple Dragons were bitten by werewolves while on patrol, then brought to the hospital for treatment. One of them unconsciously transformed and violently murdered the head priest Hurim Jaskyr in his bed, presenting a terrifying mystery for the staff and patients and causing the hospital to be locked down. The healer Delethir Mistveil allowed a group of adventurers in to investigate, and after the Purple Dragon Davit Pence involuntarily transformed into a werewolf and attacked, it became clear what the problem at hand was.</p>
<p>Multiple patients and healers were revealed to be carrying latent infections, and the surviving patients were escorted to the front doors, though they were locked. The key to the front doors was eventually recovered from Hurim Jaskyr's chambers where he still lay, but as soon as the doors were opened the werewolf Ogiyon Tomain arrived with the rest of his pack, furious at the slaying of his kin. After a brief battle the werewolf alpha was dispatched and the hospital was able to be evacuated.</p>
