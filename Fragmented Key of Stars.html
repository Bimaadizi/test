<p>The fragmented Key of Stars was a sliver of a larger and more powerful artifact called the Key of Stars that was created after the Key was destroyed in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The powers of the Far Realm were still imbued in the fragmented Key of Stars despite it being just a shard of a larger and greater item that could pierce reality and open a gate into the horrors of the Far Realm. The fragmented Key of Stars allowed its master to open a smaller gate and temporarily summon forth a far realm horror unto their enemies. It also empowered the wielder, posting their physical power, ability to deal well-aimed and especially deadly hits, as well as giving them the ability to penetrate enemy armor .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The fragmented Key of Stars resulted from a struggle between the heroes of Neverwinter and Nostura and the Cloaked Ascendancy in the late 15 th century DR.</p>
