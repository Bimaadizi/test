<p>Gunderman Brewery was a ramshackle old barn that was converted to a brewery in Harrowdale .</p>
<h2>Locations</h2>
<p>The brewery was located near the end of Lancegallop Lane on the east side of town near the coast.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The most anyone saw of the brewery was the main vat room located on the ground level. It was here that the tasty Old Smoke ale was made.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Gunderman Brewmaster owned the brewery and ran it with his three enormous but well-meaning sons and a host of human , dwarf and gnome employees, who seemed to be constantly expanding the cellars of the brewery or installing pumps to keep seepage from the Dragon Reach at bay.</p>
