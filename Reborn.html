<p>The Reborn were servants of Mystra , usually Magisters , who were granted a new life for their service.</p>
<h2>Rebirth</h2>
<p>Those who underwent Mystra's Choice and became Reborn retained their prior intelligence, but were put in a new, whole and healthy body. They kept, however, a reverence for magic no matter what; it was possible for some to face Mystra's Choice again, sometimes for as little as praying in a consecrated altar to her.</p>
<h3>Blind Reborn</h3>
<p>Blind reborn were deprived of any memories of their prior lives, but had the power to cast a spell; this power was passed on to their offspring. However, casting this spell cost them some of their vitality.</p>
<p>Example spells they could cast included slightly modified invisibility , levitate , change self , blindness , strength , minor creation , locate object or obscure object , dispel magic , affect normal fires , dancing lights , feather fall , mending , light , shield , spider climb , darkness , ESP , wraithform , sleep , or flaming sphere .</p>
<h3>Wise Reborn</h3>
<p>Wise reborn kept their memories, but could only cast the spells they could use or were immune to as Magisters , once per day each. Never able to become magicians again, some found this to be a torment. They also gained the ability to, at will, turn themselves into wingless wonders , though they could not shift back at will; they only had the option to do this when touched by magic.</p>
<h2>Known Reborn</h2>
<p>Noum√©a Drathchuld was an exception, neither blind nor wise, to the general rules for the Reborn.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>A few Reborn became Masters of Doors at Mystran temples. Others became spell component merchants, and patrons of adventurers, who sought old magic. Others became sages; per the Heralds , there were two that entered Candlekeep , and at least one retired to Highmoon in Deepingdale . A rare few became "sorcerer-slayers" (bounty hunters) or "magic hunters" (adventurers).</p>
