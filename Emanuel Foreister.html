<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime circa the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR , the adventuring Company of the Shining Stars, backed by a wealthy Sembian individual, set out to explore the mysterious cellars of the vanished mansion in Centaur Bridge . Reportedly, the adventurers awoke a "great evil" that started devouring adventurers one at a time. Emanuel ended up being the only survivor, escaping, as the party's cleric of Tymora attempted to keep the tentacled death at bay. The sole survivor claimed that a deepspawn or similar beast was unleashed as the adventurers opened an ancient sarcophagus within the cellars.</p>
<p>Following this disastrous adventure, Emanuel Foreister retired from adventuring and settled in Nimpeth , one of the Free Cities of the Vilhon Reach . He pilgrimaged to Centaur Bridge every year to pay respect to his fallen comrades on the day of their death. He's been approached by many aspiring adventurers, and the rogue answered their questions eagerly, desiring revenge against the deepspawn. However, Emanuel refused even to approach the mansion and its accursed cellars.</p>
