<p>Lesser shadowraths , which were also called blackbones , were a form of undead that had a connection with the dangerous artifact known as the Crown of Horns .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These creatures resembled blackened skeletons whose eyes glowed with crimson energy.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Lesser shadowraths retained their intelligence, but were under the complete control of whoever wore the Crown of Horns if they were within 300 feet (91 meters).</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Any magical or psionic abilities acquired by a lesser shadowrath during their life were lost upon their transformation. The touch of a lesser shadowrath was similar to the chill touch spell , causing physical harm and temporarily draining a bit of the target's strength. Death would result if the target was completely drained of their strength.</p>
<p>These creatures were immune to normal and silver weapons.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>If uncontrolled, a lesser shadowrath sought to destroy spellcasters or followers of Mystra .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lesser shadowraths were created by the "ray of undeath" power of the Crown of Horns . The ray of undeath destroyed all non-magical equipment carried by the individual when they were struck. Any magic items carried by the individual were simply dropped to the ground and abandoned or collected for the Crown bearer.</p>
