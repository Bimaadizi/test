<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kelnozz was classmates with Drizzt Do'Urden at Melee-Magthere , the fighters' academy. Their class, which began circa 1317 DR was unusually large; it began with 25 students and ended with 22. Kelnozz was Drizzt's first "friend". They partnered during the first Grand Melee , but Kelnozz turned on Drizzt, leaving him in eighth place and revealing to him the wicked nature of the drow.</p>
<p>At the next Grand Melee, Drizzt gained his revenge on Kelnozz by eliminating him early, reducing him to last in their class.</p>
