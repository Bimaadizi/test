<p>Ooze para-elementals , also known as mud elementals , were a variety of para-elemental composed of ooze .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These types of para-elementals had mutable forms that appeared as dark, liquid masses of writhing tendrils. They most often took on a form with a torso, arms, and a head with gaping black indentations where a mouth and eyes would be. And according to some their bodies could be highly acidic , rapidly dissolving most organic material and metal.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Like all para-elementals they were wary, cautious, and even unfriendly to outsiders in their home plane.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Possessing mutable forms, ooze para-elementals were capable of shifting their way through the smallest and tightest of crevices. They were also capable of imitating the passwall spell and possessed a minor resistance to elemental earth and elemental water based spells, though some claimed it was an immunity. And some claimed that the spell transmute mud to rock could petrify them. When it came to weapons, they generally could only be harmed by those with a +1 or greater enchantment .</p>
