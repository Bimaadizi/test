<p>The Harrowdale garrison was a fortification in Scardale Town established by the Seven Burghers of Harrowdale during the occupation of Scardale in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<p>After the second inter-dale war , the government of Mistledale originally sent a detachment of Grey Riders but soon recalled them in lieu of a different martial force. The riders were replaced with members of the large, Sembian adventuring company called the Sword of Yhaunn . Over time, these steadfast adventurers were supplemented by mercenaries that had been financed by Sembia outright. By 1367 DR , the garrison had become an open Sembian camp and the Harrowdale ambassador had to plead to the Seven Burghers for new, loyal soldiers.</p>
