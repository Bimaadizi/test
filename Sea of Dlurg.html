<p>The Sea of Dlurg , or Etalis among inhabitants of its depths, was more of a large bay than a sea, located between two nations in the Unapproachable East – Aglarond and Thesk . The majority of its waters were considered the territory of Aglarond.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Sea of Dlurg was a calm body of water, sheltered from storms of the Sea of Fallen Stars . A major Thayan waterway – the River Umber , ran across the nation of the Red Wizards and emptied into the Sea of Dlurg on its eastern side. The other shores of the sea were marked by magnificent, steep, and high Dragonjaw Mountains that stretched into Cape Dragonfang to the Sea of Dlurg's northwest. At its narrowest point – roughly halfway between the main body of the Inner Sea and the eastern edge of the bay, the southern and northern shores of the Sea of Dlurg were only fifteen miles apart.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The sea's waters were some of the richest in aquatic life in the entire Sea of Fallen Stars, with almost no dangers or hostile inhabitants. The Sea of Dlurg's warm waters hid the mysterious Hills Bymmalyn , the underwater hilly area of the Inner Sea where locathah nomads of eastern Serôs spent their winters in subaqueous caverns.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The Sea of Dlurg's connection to the River Umber made it busy with trade and fishing vessels from the settlements on the sea's shores, as well as Nethjet and Nethentir of Thay up the river. Trade routes passing through the Sea of Dlurg were famously safe from pirates and buccaneers. The Simbul of Aglarond made piracy punishable by immediate death in the waters surrounding her nation. Additional security was brought by a family of benevolent copper dragons who laired atop the Dragonjaw Mountains and were ready to aid ships in distress.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR , the nation of Thay used the Sea of Dlurg as its shipping lane to the Inner Sea. During active military conflicts, the passage was barred by the Aglarondan fortress of Emmech .</p>
<p>With the advent of the Spellplague , the Sea of Fallen Stars lost a significant amount of its waters, and with it, the Sea of Dlurg retreated, removing access to the Inner Sea from its coastal settlements.</p>
<p>During the Second Sundering in the autumn of the Year of the Iron Dwarf's Vengeance, 1485 DR , the Great Rain began to fall around the Sea of Fallen Stars and continued unceasingly for over a year. This constant storm caused massive floods; thousands perished from drowning, lightning strikes, or bursts of wind that capsized ships. By the time the rain abated, the Sea of Fallen Stars had swollen back to its former size, restoring the Sea of Dlurg to its former state.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>Several notable settlements stood on the shores of the Sea of Dlurg. Towns of Dlusk and Osker took the sea's Aglarondan side, and in Thesk – the city of Milvarune in the Dragonjaw Mountains. All of these settlements fished in the Sea of Dlurg, making the bay their primary food source.</p>
