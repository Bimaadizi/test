<p>Zalathorm Kirkson was the Netyarch , or wizard -king, of the nation of Halruaa in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As of 1367 DR , Zalathorm served as the leader of Halruaa and head of the Council of Elders . Zalathorm's tower in Halarahh served as the seat of his rulership. When meeting with the Council, he would use a magical crystal orb that allowed him to contact all 400 Elders of the Council if needed.</p>
<p>At some point, Zalathorm enlisted the Halruaan wizard Dwalimar Omen and the crew of the skyship Realms Master to hunt down dangerous artifacts .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Among Zalathorm's vast collection of magical items was a special carriage that radiated a globe of invulnerability upon command. This wondrous carriage was a true rarity in the arcane world since a globe of invulnerability was stationary when cast. Zalathorm never parted with the secret by which he was able to accomplish the magical feat of a mobile globe of invulnerability .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In their youth, Zalathorm and Akhlaur worked together to develop a spell that granted them both everlasting life.</p>
<p>Aklhaur was rescued in 1373 DR thanks to the efforts of the wild elf magehound Kiva and the sorceress Tzigone . After being released from the portal, Aklhaur launched an attack against Halruaa, triggering the Wizardwar . During the battle, Aklhaur faced Zalathorm, and both killed each other. Zalathorm was then resurrected by his allies.</p>
