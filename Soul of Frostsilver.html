<p>The Soul of Frostsilver was an earth elemental that resided deep in the Frostsilver Mines in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Even if it was destroyed, the Soul of Frostsilver could simply reappear at a later time elsewhere within the Mines. It could create walls of earth and stone at will, and in combat it favored punching with its fists.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Soul of Frostsilver was bound by the Frostsilver dwarves to the tunnels of their Mines as a guardian at the entrance to the forges. Laeral Silverhand speculated that its binding might have a sinister implication, and was proved correct when her adventurers discovered that another earth elemental spirit had been similarly bound against its will inside of the Anvil of Dumathoin .</p>
