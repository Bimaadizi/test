<p>Telescopes of fantastic vision were bizarre cursed spyglasses that originated in Zakhara , the Land of Fate.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These spyglasses were cylindrical and often made of precious metal such as gold .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>For the first several uses, this spyglass functioned exactly like a telescope of true vision , magnifying images and granting the user the ability to pierce illusions and see things as they truly were. However, after the first several uses, the telescope of fantastic vision showed the viewer weird images that usually proved to appear the opposite of what they actually were. For instance, the telescope might make the viewer think a distant caravan was actually a war-party of orcs .</p>
