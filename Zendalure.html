<p>Zendalure was a gemstone with remarkable preservative properties, unique to the Realms.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Zendalure crystals could be found in places where lava had cooled and become solid. These blotchy blue-white crystals formed egg-shaped nodules approximately 2 to 6 inches (5 to 15 cm) in diameter and could be polished to a mirror-like finish. They were frequently used as inlays or cut into small cabochons for rings, earrings, and pendants. A typical specimen had a base value of 1,000gp.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Zendalure could be made into a syrup by crushing the stones into a powder and mixing it with water. This syrup could completely and indefinitely protect flesh and bone from all rot and decay. The meat or body parts had to be fully immersed in the mixture and not allowed exposure to sunlight directly. This preservative was known to keep fresh mammalian, reptilian, or avian flesh.</p>
<p>A zendalure was required as part of the process to create a dread guardian.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Zendalures were considered prized gems among the drow . They called them "rock eggs". Despite their station as a prized gem, their use was on a small scale. The exceptions were the drow followers of Ghaunadaur to whom this gem was believed to be holy.</p>
