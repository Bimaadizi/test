<p>Some time during or before the late 14 th century, Balthazar created a soul prison within the Gauntlet of Shar, which was used by Ketheric Thorm to imprison the Nightsong for over a century. The imprisonment bound the aasimar to Ketheric, granting the general immortality.</p>
<p>With the establishment of the Cult of the Absolute , Balthazar started to experiment on and modify the enchanted tadpoles produced by a dominated illithid elder brain with other Myrkulyte servants in the mind flayer colony beneath the Moonrise Towers . In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Balthazar was tasked by Ketheric with recovering the Nightsong, because Ketheric had betrayed the goddess Shar, choosing instead to become the Chosen of Myrkul, but still fed on the immortality of the Nightsong.</p>
