<p>Ynaerv's Mask was an artifact known within the ancient Imaskar Empire . It was once thought to be one of the Imaskarcana .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>An alliance of Imaskari archwizards known as the Cabal of Madness created a number of masks known as the Faces of Madness , each themed around a school of magic , over decades after striking a bargain with horrors from beyond their world. Ynaerv's Mask was one of them. Each of those major artifacts were created with a curse that only the creator knew how to avoid. Before they were able to implement their plans, however, the Mulan rebelled with the aid of their gods, ultimately destroying Imaskar as a nation. In the resulting tumult, the masks were scattered.</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>Ynaerv's Mask was a hideous mask built from the skull of an elven paladin , bearing the antlers of her mount . Small copper chains ran around the back of the mask to secure it; it covered the top of the wearer's face when worn.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Ynaerv's Mask granted an overwhelmingly powerful resistance to all spells of the Necromancy school. It allowed the user to cast such spells with an amazing level of penetration of innate resistances. The wearer could also employ control undead thrice a day, or more, depending on their force of personality. They also got the ability to cast, thrice a day, their choice of vampiric touch , animate dead , create greater undead , create undead and soul bind .</p>
<p>However, every time the mask was donned, a wearer ran the risk of being slain, and then raised as a curst were their fortitude to fail them.</p>
