<p>Catelys Gulchbreul was an illithid of the Absolute from the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Catelys Gulchbreul was a duergar or a drow , who was infected by the Absolute's tadpole with their transformation likely taking place at the very end of the creature's life.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a large group of duergar, giant spiders , and drow, was slaughtered in the home of a Bloomridge Park groundskeeper, Lavernica . The murder spree was performed by Orin the Red and her Murder Tribunal of Bhaal . Catelys Gulchbreul's body was found already in its aberrant new form in a cellar underneath Lavernica's home, near a butchered drow woman, a grotesque display – an effigy representing Sendai , a drow Bhaalspawn who died a century earlier.</p>
