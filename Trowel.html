<p>A trowel was a hand tool used for digging and construction.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Trowels had broad, flat heads that let them carry materials such as construction mortar or earth.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue sold trowels for masonry and bricklaying work. They came in 5‑inch (13‑centimeter) (2 gp ), 7‑inch (18‑centimeter) (4 gp), and 10‑inch (25‑centimeter) (5 gp) sizes, with a flat edge and a grooved edge. It was also possible to have these trowels with a personalized sigil added, but this required positive identification of the stonemason to prevent fraud.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Trowels were used by masons to spread mortar for construction work, alongside other basic tools such as hammers , chisels , squares , and brushes . The flat, wide head of a trowel also made it suitable for handling and spreading other semi-liquid materials besides mortar.</p>
<p>Trowls could also be used for gardening and other types of delicate digging, such as archaeology.</p>
<h2>Notable Trowels</h2>
<p>A rusty iron trowl was kept on display in the Lost Level of Undermountain , a relic that Melair I himself supposedly used to spread mortar.</p>
