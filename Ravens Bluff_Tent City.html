<p>Tent City , also known as Tent Town , was a sprawling tent community outside of the North Gate of Ravens Bluff in the 14 th century DR . It was considered by some to be an unofficial district of the city.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The community's name derived from it being largely made up of canvas or brightly- dyed silk tents. It was also host to corrals, stalls, and a few permanent structures. Many of the tents had wooden plank walkways between them.</p>
<p>The Cross Road , the road connecting Tantras and Mossbridges to Ravens Bluff's North Gate, cut right through the center of Tent City. A smaller, less impressive gate was situated on the road to mark the outer boundary of Tent City.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Tent City was host to a variety of different merchants, vendors, and ware hawkers. Additionally, there was always something of a hiring fair going on, though it was typically avoided by those who wished to hire discreetly, as City Watch officers and informants were frequently keeping tabs to crack down on any slave -dealings.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the spring of 1355 DR , the notorious con artist illusionist Mortimer Mittlemer was running a scam outside Tent City's gate with his wife Marilyn and associate Elmerth Willowit , impersonating a City Guardsmen and shaking down newcomers for 10 gold pieces in return for "permits" to enter Ravens Bluff, as well as smaller fees for keeping their weapons or horses .</p>
<p>When The Three Women War ravaged the Vast countryside, those who had the money to do so moved into Ravens Bluff, hoping to wait out the conflict. Those less fortunate remained outside the city's walls, where they suffered through illnesses and lack of food. Eventually bands of thieves moved into Tent City and began using it as a staging ground for their raids on Ravens Bluff. Out of concern for the city proper's safety, Tent City was demolished and its inhabitants dispersed.</p>
<p>The many vendors that once did business in Tent City were sent overflowing into both the Market District and the Torchtown neighborhood of the Uptown District , seizing vacant rooms in many of the city's abandoned buildings. The residents with money filled Ravens Bluff's one-story cottages, causing such overcrowding that they were eventually torn down in favor of constructing taller structures. Others found homes in the rundown buildings along the docks and the banks of Fire River . The more destitute of the displaced had little choice but to sleep in the city's alleys or upon its rooftops.</p>
<p>Many felt that Tent City would never return, with the Three Womens War having demonstrated the superior safety of life behind Ravens Bluff's walls. During this period of absence the space was at one point used by the city to erect tents for the Champion Games . Eventually, however, through monetary donations and charitable manual labor by Ravens Bluff's adventuring community Tent City was reconstructed. Residents slowly trickled back in following its reconstruction, with many who were well off before the War having fallen into poverty. Some looked to the city for work, while others left to pursue their own adventuring career, and some became so desperate that they joined a charismatic figure's Banite cult.</p>
