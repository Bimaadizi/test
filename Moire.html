<p>Moire was a female half-elf who was a high-ranking member of the Shadow Thieves chapter in Neverwinter on the Sword Coast North in the 1370s DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Moire was a notorious gang leader in Neverwinter's Docks district, part of the Shadow Thieves chapter under Axle Devrie . Unlike Axle, she was known to be vicious and ruthless and she sought to hold the streets of Neverwinter in her grip.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>She could have met the Kalach-Cha during the Shadow War . The Kalach-cha could have come into contact with Moire while trying to gain entrance to the Blacklake district.</p>
<p>If the Kalach-Cha and companions sided with the Watch , then they ruined many of Moire's activities. During the rescue of the informant Fihelis , Moire herself showed up to kill the spy but was defeated.</p>
<p>If the Kalach-Cha and companions sided with the thieves, then they needed to help advance Moire's activities, by working under her. Finally, the Kalach-Cha rose to work directly for Axle Devrie, the true leader of Neverwinter's Shadow Thieves and a more diplomatic individual than Moire. Finally, Moire broke away from Axle and sought to take control of the Shadow Thieves, taking advantage of the chaos during the evacuation. The Kalach-Cha could resolve this situation either by killing her, killing Axle for her, or killing them both.</p>
