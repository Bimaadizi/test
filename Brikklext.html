<p>Brikklext was a hamlet located in the Upperdark under the southern foothills of the Earthspur Mountains , between Impiltur and the Vast .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This hamlet, unlike other goblin communities, was somewhat civilized. The tribe was ruled by a mixed council of blues ( psionic goblins) and bugbears , and together they managed to force the goblins out of their usual squalor and lack of perspective, guiding them into a more cohesive society.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The peculiarity of Brikklext was its underground water reservoir. Under the blues' direction, the goblins diverted a spring that once brought water to the surface. By digging and dam building, they redirected its waters to flood their own underground caves, creating a vast reservoir of clean drinking water.</p>
<p>When their spring dried up, the surface people had to accept trade with the goblins, who began appearing everyday with loads of water casks for sale.</p>
<p>The goblin "citizens" of Brikklext accepted civilization slowly. The idea of codified laws and a trade system was strange to them, though some understood the benefits.</p>
