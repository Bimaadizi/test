<p>Wyvernspur was a noble house of Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Holdings</h2>
<p>House Wyvernspur had a seat at Redstone Castle in Immersea , where the most prominent local building was a fortified sandstone manor house on a high hill just south of town. The family also owned Wyvernspur House in Suzail .</p>
<p>The family owned most of the land surrounding Wyvernwater and the Wyvernflow , bringing substantial wealth and political influence. House Wyvernspur had additional holdings in Hultail . The Hullack Forest was mentioned as also belonging to the Wyvernspurs.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Some Wyvernspur members could wield a family heirloom, the wyvern's spur, to shapeshift into a very large wyvern with magic immunity. Not every Wyvernspur could do so, but only those who were "kissed by Selûne"—people with some affinity to lycanthropy . A candidate was chosen by the guardian spirit of the family crypt, one for each Wyvernspur generation. The spur itself was kept in the crypt, and only those who were Wyvernspur by blood or marriage could bypass the spirit.</p>
<p>Most of this was a guarded secret. Outside of the family, the spur was only rumored to ensure that Wyvernspur line would never dwindle. People often assumed the famed relic was a metal device to spur wyverns, but it was actually a spur from wyvern's leg, looking like a dried chunk of meat the size and shape of a baby zucchini and uglier than three-month-old sausage .</p>
<p>Over the years, many generations of Wyvernspur adventurers have earned the crown 's gratitude by protecting Cormyr as wyverns. The knowledge of this usually wasn't public. Among those who had Selûne's kiss were Paton , Gerrin , Gould III , Eswip , Dorath , Cole and Giogioni . Many of the chosen ones eventually died in battle. Upon their deaths, a spur had to be sliced off of their wyvern bodies to return them to human shape and reclaim the initial spur.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The house was founded by Paton Wyvernspur somewhere in 10 century DR.</p>
<p>In 1358 DR , Flattery Wyvernspur tried to steal the wyvern's spur, bringing his massive levitating fortress with hordes of undead from Anauroch to Redstone Castle. Despite Dorath keeping the secret of shapeshifting hidden from most of the family, Giogioni Wyvernspur managed to reclaim the spur, master the wyvern form, and stop Flattery with the help of his relatives and Olive Ruskettle .</p>
<p>The crown of Cormyr often called upon this family to fund projects in their area and near Hullack Forest. In the event of Azoun IV 's death during the Abraxus incident , this family favored a Vangerdahast regency instead of a ruling council.</p>
<p>The Wyvernspurs were granted all Cormaeril lands after the Cormaerils were stripped of title after the Abraxus affair, which approximately quintupled the income and responsibilities of House Wyvernspur.</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , House Wyvernspur thrived, flush with money, number of living family members, and family accolades.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>According to family legend, the history of the house began when Paton Wyvernspur , the house founder, helped a female wyvern slay the bandits that had killed her mate and had stolen her eggs. In gratitude for the return of her hatchlings, the wyvern sliced off her mate's right spur and bestowed it upon Paton. She promised that the Wyvernspur line would never dwindle as long as the spur remained in their possession. The fact that wyverns aren't usually very nice creatures is often handwaved in that story.</p>
<p>It is unknown how much of that is fable. But the remains of a wyvern couple were buried in the family crypt, and its guardian spirit was a female wyvern, likely the one involved in the legend.</p>
<p>Although the spur's shapeshifting powers were kept secret, there still were rumors that Wyvernspurs could transform into wyverns. It was called their "gift" or " curse ".</p>
