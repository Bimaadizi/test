<p>A talisman was a fetish or item of jewelry enchanted to act as a magic item . Talismans were particularly common in the lands of Kara-Tur and Maztica .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A talisman was generally no bigger than a holy symbol and very light. The form of the talisman was often a clue to its magical power. For example, a talisman shaped like a goldfish scale might grant the user the ability to breathe underwater .</p>
<p>Most talismans were made from natural materials, such as bone, feathers, or dried plants. In some lands, a talisman could be made from folded paper . The orcs of the Thousand Fists tribe integrated silver and iris agate into the crafting of their talismans of spell turning . In Maztica, talismans were always items of beauty and symmetry.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Talismans usually granted some sort of benefit or protection to the user, rarely ever any sort of offensive capabilities. Like wands or potions , the rules of magic usually limited the creation of talismans to weaker spells.</p>
<p>The method of activation for talismans varied but usually involved touching the object and concentrating for a brief moment or speaking a word of command. Anyone could use a talisman's powers; one did not have to be trained in magic to do so. Most (but not all) talismans could be used a single time before their magic was spent. When used, such talismans crumbled away to ash or dust.</p>
<p>Talismans made of sunstone had the power to ward off any undead that were affected by sunlight .</p>
<p>In Maztica, Azuposi priests and special roughish spellcasters called fetishists could use talismans to enhance the powers of their spells .</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>In Maztica, two broad categories of talismans were crafted, and it required a particular powerful spell to create them. These were talismans of pluma and talismans of hishna .</p>
<p>In Zakhara , the spell death talisman was used to create a special talisman that would perpetually remain in its current condition until the caster's death. For example, a small piece of equipment could be made to resist water damage or decay from age, and it would also fade away into dust when the owner was no longer alive, preventing anyone else from inheriting the item.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Unlike in other lands, in Kuong Kingdom , wu jen kept themselves hidden from general society, and the wearing of talismans was used as a secret means of identification.</p>
