<p>After the removal of Koji Matsutomo in Wa Year 1652 (1234 DR) , the daimyate of Aru Province passed to Seiji Kubahachi . The Kubahachi clan governed the province ably for two generations.</p>
<p>However, the third daimyo, Koji Kubahachi , was cruel and vindictive. In Wa Year 1713 (1295 DR) , when he levied a special tax to pay for castle improvements and a certain fishing village fell short, Koji killed every inhabitant, razed it, salted the earth, and did the same to two neighboring villages, insisting they must been aware of a plot to defraud him. In Wa Year 1717 (1299 DR) , two ninjas infiltrated Aru disguised as pilgrims and tried to assassinate Koji. They were killed in the attack, Koji couldn't identify who hired them, and in revenge and as a message to his unknown enemy, he executed every one of the pilgrims in the train. At this excess, shogun Masanori removed Koji both from office and from life, and returned the daimyate to the Matsutomo clan, under Masakito Matsutomo .</p>
