<p>Dumar Sturmarik was a ruler of the Realm of Tides in the Utter East during the time of the Bloodforge Wars ( 648 â€“ 657 DR ).</p>
<p>Seen as a greedy tyrant, Dumar focused on imposing tariffs on all seaborne merchants. Deciding to put an end to Dumar's reign, the leader of the Legendary Campaign took advantage of the focus on tariffs and infiltrated the Realm of Tides, before attacking in a bloodforge battle.</p>
