<p>Malabog's castle was a fortress in the Feywild and also the personal domain of the fomorian king Malabog .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Quite fittingly, Malabog's castle was located within his own personal domain found within the Feywild.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Like all fomorian fortresses, Malabog's castle was both imposing, perilous and unnaturally alluring.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Beyond its massive stone walls, and spacious courtyard, the castle was a twisted labyrinth that was difficult to navigate. It was a sprawling maze composed of stone, corrupted tree roots and crystalline structures.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The inner halls of Malabog's castle were unearthly and sinister. They were eerily illuminated by fluttering will-o'-wisps , phosphorescent mushrooms , and glimmering crystals.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The great stone walls served as the first line of protection for the inner castle, each of which was well guarded by siege catapults to turn away defenders.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The castle was originally constructed by scores of cyclopes that were enslaved by King Malabog.</p>
<p>Circa the Faer√ªnian Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the fomorian king led an assault on New Sharandar in the Feywild , staged from his castle within his realm. His agents began to open up passageways from their realm to that of the elves, corrupt the innocent beings of nature they encountered along the way. He launched this campaign of conquest with the aid of the lich Valindra Shadowmantle , who granted him control over the blue dragon Fulminorax for his efforts.</p>
<p>In response, the Iliyanbruen elves led by Iliyasha Guidingstar and Merrisara Winterwhite conscripted the Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge of Neverwinter to stop King Malabog and route his army of giants and dark fey . After aiding the elves of the Feywild, the heroes ventured through the realm of Malabog , and launched their assault on Malabog's castle.</p>
<p>The heroes demolished the siege towers and slayed the fell troll troops they encountered outside Malabog's, stormed its walls, and defeated the giants stationed along them. At the same time, another competing party of five adventurers had breached the castle as well. Regardless of these other assailants, the heroes slew the fomorian commander Krol Nightforge and made their way to the castle's throne room, where they defeated Malabog himself. They chased down Fulminorax along the castle grounds and slew the great blue dragon in a grand courtyard, but were unable to stop Valindra from fleeing the realm.</p>
<p>With its great leader dead, Malabog's Castle lay in ruin.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Malabog's castle was also home to the fomorian king's great army. It comprised the fomorian giant overseers and military commanders, formations of elite cyclops warriors, and a great number of dark fey creatures, such as troll and redcap servants that were considered largely expendable.</p>
