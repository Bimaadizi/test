<p>Zann was the scholarly deity of learning and intelligence of Zakhara . He was one of the eight Great Gods of the Land of Fate and preached the value of studying and understanding, of seeking new and preserving old knowledge. Zann's symbol was a fountain's jet.</p>
<p>Zann was portrayed as a man in city dress with all the paraphernalia of a scribe. Like other Zakharan gods he was above such concerns as alignment , as knowledge and intelligence could be used to build a peaceful society or to subvert it. Zann's priests kept the greatest universities and libraries of Zakhara.</p>
