<p>The Tashan Gap was a rather wide mountain pass found in northern Tashalar on the Chultan Peninsula of southwest Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Tashan Gap marked where the dense Black Jungles pushed through the lowland area between the Delphin Mountains in the east and the Hazur Mountains in the west. The gap measured nearly 80 miles (130 kilometers) across, yet the dense jungle made any kind of passage difficult.</p>
