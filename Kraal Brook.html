<p>Kraal Brook was a short, swift river in central Netheril that descended from the Lodestar Mountains .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The river ran from the Lodestar Mountains down to Hidden Lake . Though only 20 miles (32 kilometers) long, it descended 20,000 feet (6,100 meters) in that course, and was largely made up of waterfalls, rapids, and other impassable hazards. The city of Earsome lay near the mouth of the river where it met Hidden Lake.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kraal Brook was the site of repeated battles between the Netherese of Earsome and the orcs of the nearby Hidden Forest . Though they felt secure in their military dominance, Earsome was attacked five times during the later years of Netheril by the orcs, starting with the Kraal Brook Massacre of 3170 NY (−689 DR) . The orcs continued attacking until the city was finally destroyed in 3517 NY (−342 DR) .</p>
