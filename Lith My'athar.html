<p>Lith My'athar was a very small drow city in the Underdark ruled over by House Mae'Vir .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the Valsharess began a campaign to declare herself supreme ruler of the Underdark. When her forces took over the northern drow territories, Lith My'athar was the only city that remained unconquered. A fragile alliance existed between the native Lolth worshipers and a group of refugees composed of Eilistraee worshipers, led by The Seer, a powerful Eilistraeean priestess.</p>
<p>During that year, the adventurer known as Drogan Droganson's pupil and companions found themselves conscripted into the defense of the city. The adventurer had initially entered Undermountain as part of an effort to defend Waterdeep against attacks on the surface by the Valsharess's forces. Eventually, they rescued Halaster Blackcloak from imprisonment but, in return, the Mad Mage placed a geas on the hero to defeat the Valsharess, then magically transported the adventurer and companions to Lith My'athar.</p>
<p>Knowing that an attack on the city was inevitable, the Seer tasked the adventurers with weakening the attacking forces by disrupting alliances that the Valsharess had made with factions of beholders , illithids , and an undead cult lead by the dracolich Vix'thra , while seeking potential allies among the golems on the Isle of the Maker and another nearby island with a mysterious settlement of avariel .</p>
<p>When the attack came, the adventurer co-coordinated the defense of the city, first at the main gate and then the city's port.</p>
