<h2>History</h2>
<p>On late 1357Â DR , Tornar reported to Belgon Bradaskor that he'd been a witness to Marlel leading Shandril Shessair and her husband into an ambush at the Stormy Tankard , and was told to inform Rendilar Bluthlock he was free to spend with Belgon's backing to send people after Shandril, so they'd be on the line of fire of all the factions hunting after her spellfire . Later, he was instructed by Belgon, into whose quarters Sharantyr had broken, to give her Flamewind and supplies for a trip. After her parting, Tornar was instructed to ride after her, and kill her after she had killed enough of Bluthlock's men. Unknown to him, he was scried on by the Zhentarim Korthauvar Hammantle and Hlael Toraunt , who already knew of him.</p>
<p>Tornar eventually caught up to Sharantyr, and struck at her with a poisoned crossbow quarrel. He accepted a token from her: a lock of hair, instead of finishing the job, confident the poison would finish her off, though Sharantyr claimed she knew the poison to be bloodbite , which did not affect her. She enspelled him with some powdered gemstone, which compelled him to go as far from her as possible.</p>
<p>Immediately after Shandril Shessair's immolation, Sharantyr was teleported all the way back to the Blackrocks , where Tornar found her again, badly injured. Rather than kill her, he said he wanted to part with her as a friend, and helped her rest safely.</p>
