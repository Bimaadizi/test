<p>Ozama was a hot-tempered and magic-hungry wizard responsible for cursing and trapping her fiancé Jarial in a boulder in 1353 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She had beautiful violet eyes that burned with passion.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Ozama had a sharp tongue and blinding temper.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Ozama possessed an immense talent for magic.</p>
<p>Ozama often conjured a magical dagger that had a parasitic effect on its targets, that ice dagger looked uncannily similar to the enchanted dagger called the Borea's Blood with only difference, Borea's Blood was of ice-like blue color.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>At the time of her death, Ozama was wearing her enchanted snakeskin boots that protected her from poisons and venoms and a gray woolen cloak .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1353 DR , Ozama met a young sorcerer Jarial and they quickly fell madly in love becoming fiancés. She convinced Jarial to travel with her to the ruins of Myth Drannor in search for a dark naga collector of magic named Preybelish who could lead them to the artifact called the Wizard’s Torc . Eventually the couple had a fiery argument over something trivial as Jarial renounced his love for the sorceress. In heat of the moment, Ozama ensorcered a pebble and threw it to Jarial's feet. The pebble grew and swallowed the sorcerer's lower torso, trapping him in the Dwarven Dungeons of the ruined elven city. Ozama left him with a riddle that was the solution to the curse, and despite Jarial's begging, she stormed off, leaving him alone within a dark and empty underground chamber.</p>
<p>Ozama fully intended to return to Jarial after the man learned his lesson, but she met her doom in the Dungeons overwhelmed by monsters. Sixteen years later, in 1369 DR a group of adventurers fighting to stop the Cult of the Dragon 's plans on corrupting Myth Drannor's mythal came across the entombed sorcerer and easily freed him. Jarial joined the group that saved him from the torturous existence, eventually finding Ozama's skeleton surrounded by perished monsters.</p>
