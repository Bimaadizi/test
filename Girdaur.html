<p>The Girduar family was a clan of disgraced dwarven artisans and master craftsfolk as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the time of their downfall in the 15 th century DR, the family had originally come into prominence within the past two dwarven generations. They were ruined both financially and reputationally when their enemies stole their masterworks and tools. The young Naomlen Girdaur devoted the next decades of her life training as a rogue and assassin , and sought to reclaim the family's lost works and lost honor. She worked with groups as varied as the Zhentarim and the Open Lord of Waterdeep to accomplish this singular goal.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, Naomlen had reclaimed enough pieces of her family's masterworks to use them to forge a pair of enchanted kukris known as the kukris of cunning , which she wielded in continued pursuit of her goal.</p>
