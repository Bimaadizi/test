<p>Felodar Aumar was one of the Warring Princes of Athalantar and the most successful after his brother Belaur Aumar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Felodar never loved his country or his family; his only interest was amassing wealth. He departed his realm in the Year of Lost Voices, 214 DR . Soon, he established a base in Calimshan , where he established trade between Athalantar and Calimshan and other lands, which enriched and satisfied his father, King Uthgrael Aumar . However, Felodar also involved himself in all kinds of criminal dealings.</p>
<p>He became so powerful in Calimshan that he decided to send his own group of mages, dubbed the Night Mages , to confront the magelords who followed his brother Belaur Aumar , but with no success.</p>
<p>Felodar remained a threat to Belaur's rule for much of the time the eldest prince sat on the Stag Throne but at last he was poisoned by a Calishite rival in late 239 DR .</p>
