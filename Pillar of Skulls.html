<p>The Pillar of Skulls was a landmark in the plane of Avernus , the first layer of the Nine Hells . It contained the skulls of victims of the Blood War , taken as trophies by the devils .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Pillar towered over 1 mi (1.6 km) into the sky of Avernus. It comprised a wide variety of skulls, ranging from the tiny to the size of a house. The majority, however, were of demons , the enemy of the devils. .</p>
<p>The majority of the skulls that comprised the Pillar were of those killed in the Blood War . However, in some cases the souls of those whose lies and betrayals led to deaths of other people were condemned to join the Pillar in the form of a sentient skull.</p>
<p>It stood by the ledge around the layer of Avernus, near a low point where access to the next layer down, Dis , was possible via an exceptionally tall spire in that city. Near the base of the Pillar of Skulls was a huge cave mouth, in which laired the dragon-goddess Tiamat , who guarded passage between the layers here.</p>
