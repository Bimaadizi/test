<p>The branch of vile curses was an enchanted quarterstaff of crude make, used by Srass Marnanr and his lizardfolk marauders and mercenaries in Cormyr in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The stave possessed powerful +4 or +5 enchantments that made the weapons more deadly and guided the wielder's arms towards the target. The branches of vile curses greatly boosted the wielder's spell power and empowered negative energy and necromancy spells even further, and, upon a critical strike, bestowed a wilting curse on the target.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, a branch of vile curses was wielded by Srass Marnanr, who led Rynarr Nosryrr and a gang of lizardfolk to attack a prison convoy that transported captured Sharran cultist Dedryk Black to the Wheloon Prison .</p>
