<p>The Tome of Twelve Seals was a unique, enchanted book .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This tome was a thick book whose cover was made from the underbelly hide of a red dragon . Bound within the book was a total of twelve thick, black leather pages. Attached to each of these pages was a single, rune-inscribed metal disk, evocative of a seal like one might find on a door or urn.</p>
<p>Originally all twelve of these seals were made made of gold and quite shiny, but over time they lost their luster, became charred, and turned into lead.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The runes etched on each seal within the Tome of Twelve Seals was a command word that activated their seal's effect. The golden seals, when activated, would conjure one of many types of monster as if by a summon monster spell .</p>
<p>The first seal would conjure an air elemental , the second would conjure a fire elemental , the fourth would conjure an earth elemental , the fifth would conjure a dragon horse , the eighth would conjure a gibbering mouther , the ninth would conjure a jann , and the tenth would conjure a marid . Those pages not mentioned had lost their magic and would not conjure anything.</p>
<p>Upon activating one of these seals, they would unleash a blinding flash and transform into lead, becoming inert.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By 1358 DR , five of the tome's seals had become inert. The seals that had become inert were on pages three, six, seven, eleven, and twelve.</p>
<p>In 1358 DR, the tome was one of many belongings of a reclusive wizard in the Savage Frontier that were being sold at an estate auction. During this auction, a group of thieves and an illusionist stole the Tome of Twelve Seals , fleeing with it to the Kraken Society 's headquarters in Yartar .</p>
<p>By 1372 DR , two more of the tome's seals had become inert. These seals were those that had contained a dragon horse and marid.</p>
