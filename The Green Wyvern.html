<p>The Green Wyvern was a tavern in Suzail in Cormyr during the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>One of the doors at the taproom, often blocked with a broom , hid a portal to Marsember . The portal was not common knowledge.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point after the start of spring in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , the Red Wizard Harnrim Starangh and the War Wizard Huldyl Rauthur briefly teleported to the tavern, where they knew the bard and Harper Roldro Tattershar spent time. They discussed Vangerdahast 's latest spell , which was to bind dragons to service, so that he "overheard" it. Then they teleported back out; Roldro quickly used the portal and left.</p>
