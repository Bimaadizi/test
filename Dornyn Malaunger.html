<p>Dornyn Malaunger was one of nine founding members of the Great Goblet criminal mercantile organization, circa the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Dornyn was very handsome and liked to dress with flair. He left his hair tousled.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Malaunger was a restless schemer with very little patience, lax morals, and no scruples. He was selfish, self-centered, and suspicious of everyone's motives. He wanted to be in the center of power with complete knowledge of all plans and schemes. He liked women that could match his pace in life and that got a thrill from intrigue and danger, but he wouldn't hesitate to break a lover's neck if he suspected her of treachery.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Dornyn collected magic swords and had a number of blades in his collection, but he didn't know all of the abilities they possessed. Like all the Lords of the Goblet, he kept one of the golden goblets that were the model for the symbol of the organization. It contained a finger or toe that once belonged to Halonidas Dreie (whose assassination marked the founding of the Great Goblet) as a reminder and warning against treachery between the Lords.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Malaunger jumped from one enterprise to another with reckless abandon, taking what he could from a business and using it to fund the next scheme. His suspicious nature and need for conspiratorial awareness led him to crush other cabals and plots to which he was not privy. Dornyn did not have many long-term plans, but he did have a desire to turn his sword collection into an invisible cloud of blades at his beck and call. As of 1370 DR, he had not found a wizard that he trusted to work on making his vision a reality.</p>
