<p>House Hss'tafi was a tribe of yuan-ti distinguishable by their cobra -like hoods. Members of this tribe were called Hss'tafin.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>House Hss'tafi once resided on the northwest shores of the Lapal Sea in the Black Jungles . The entire tribe was magically transported from the jungles into the ruins of Ss'thar'tiss'ssun in the Forest of Wyrms in -320 DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>House Hss'tafi viewed themselves as the most practical of the ha'srammass . They worked well under the nagas and other species, realizing that by doing so they could ultimately advance Sseth 's goals, and by default those of the yuan-ti, across Faer√ªn . This view led the other great yuan-ti tribes to view the Hss'tafin with distrust.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Hss'tafin became part of the ruling class of Najara , the Kingdom of Snakes, ever since their arrival in -320 DR. They held various roles including those of merchants, administrators, and religious leaders.</p>
<p>House Hss'tafi played a critical role in rebuilding the ruined sarrukh city of Ss'thar'tiss'ssun during the reign of Terpenzi . The Hss'tafin were instrumental in reestablishing the rule of the nagara after Najara's fall which helped transform the kingdom into a major power in the Western Heartlands .</p>
<p>The Hss'tafin were the first tribe of yuan-ti to develop the process for creating tainted ones and broodguards .</p>
