<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Spur, 1348 DR , merchant Harmantle became involved in criminal tax evasion. Tathanter Doarmond , a Wizard of War placed in charge of the investigation, was presented with two massive letters, one from Harmantle and another for a fellow merchant. Both letters heavily contradicted each other. The final discussion in the case was voiced by Vangerdahast Aeiulvana , the Royal Magician of Cormyr. Both merchants lied in their letters, however, Harmantle was the one sent to the dungeons.</p>
