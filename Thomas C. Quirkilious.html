<p>Thomas C. Quirkilious , Maker of Musical Instruments, was the dragonborn proprietor of the Chromatic Scale music shop in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Thomas was a tall male dragonborn with fiery eyes and crimson scale coloration. He had a curious and grand personality and wore expensive finery.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thomas became the proprietor of Chromatic Scale some time before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . Thomas's daughter, Cate departed Baldur's Gate for Calimshan sometime in or prior to 1492 DR, where she encountered a curious snakeskin musical instrument called a slitherhorn . In her letter to Thomas, she promised to bring the instrument home and play it for him. Another friend, or possibly a family member, of Thomas's named Eryk sent him a letter talking about a metal called pyrohydram Eryk had encountered on his adventures that was allegedly capable of producing quality pipes . Eryk planned to return to the Gate with a bag of the ore for Thomas to be fashioned into flutes . During the same year, Thomas was known to experiment with various materials in order to produce quality strings for his instruments. However, using peahen gizzards was a gross failure, ratgut was proven to be hard to work with, and catgut was a failure, despite being better suited for string making than sheepsgut .</p>
