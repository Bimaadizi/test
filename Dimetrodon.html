<p>A dimetrodon ( pronounced : / d ɪ ˈ m ɛ t r oʊ d ɑː n / di-ME-tro-dan ), also known as sailback by the inhabitants of the Malatran Plateau , was a species of ancient carnivorous reptile which lived alongside various dinosaurs .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These creatures bore some resemblance to alligators and were even said to produce a snarl similar to that of an alligator . The most distinctive feature on a dimetrodon's body was the neural spine sail that spanned the length of their back.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Dimetrodons typically hunted in shallow waters or shores, much like crocodiles , and spent much of their time sunning atop rocks near these waters. They were generally considered to be highly territorial.</p>
