<p>Golden Hills was a region in the Dothion half of Bytopia in the Great Wheel cosmology model, and home to most of the gnome pantheon . It was considered a celestial plane in the World Tree cosmology model. Between the Spellplague and the Second Sundering , it was set adrift in the Astral Sea and had merged with Arvandor according to the World Axis cosmology model.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In the Great Wheel cosmology model, descriptions of the Golden Hills varied primarily in the size of the "hills". Some characterized them literally as a group of seven hills nestled in the center of Dothion, the "topmost" layer of the Twin Paradises . But it was also said that Baervan Wildwanderer 's oak tree, Whisperleaf , grew on the side of mountain that was joined at the top to another mountain that rose from Shurrock, the other half of the Twin Paradises. Connections to this region were the same as for the Twin Paradises, but it was said that mine shafts in Flandal Steelskin 's domain connected the Mithral Forge to digs on other planes, including Acheron , Baator , Concordant Opposition , the Elemental Plane of Earth , Pandemonium , the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Minerals , and Ysgard .</p>
<p>In the World Tree cosmology model, Golden Hills was a mildly good-aligned celestial plane connected to the trunk of the World Tree . Travel to and from other celestial planes could be accomplished via the World Tree as long as the Tree or its servants approved. The usual method of travel was journeying through the Astral plane , either spiritually by astral projection or physically by using plane shift or similar magics. There was a known portal to the realm of Gond the Wonderbringer in the House of Knowledge located somewhere on or under the hill belonging to Flandal Steelskin . Flandal's forges were heated by a portal to the Elemental Plane of Fire , but it is unknown whether this was a one-way or two-way portal.</p>
<p>In the World Axis cosmology , the Seven Golden Hills were considered to be scattered throughout the landscape of the astral dominion of Arvandor .</p>
<p>The seven rolling hills rose from the vast plain, covered in golden grass. Each hill belonged to one of the gnomish deities. Urdlen , the eighth member of the gnomish pantheon, made its lair in Hammergrim , according to the World Tree, or in the 399 th layer of the Abyss , in the Great Wheel interpretation. All accounts agreed that everything in the home of the Lords of the Golden Hills was suffused with a polished gold hue.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The only native inhabitants of this plane were the devas , solars , planetars , and other angels that served the local gods. Gnome and svirfneblin petitioners made up the rest of the population.</p>
