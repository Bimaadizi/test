<p>Khalid's Wall was an ancient ruined wall that was built to separate the Dragon's Head Peninsula from the rest of Tethyr .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>A small village of Jhaansciim stood about a mile southwest of the southern end of Khalid's Wall. The town was famed for a special type of stew served at The Wallside inn, named after Khalid's. The wall was built in the middle of the Tethyr Peninsula , on its so-called Neck , south of the town of Murann . A road ran parallel to Khalid's Wall, from Murann to the Firedrake Road and Toaketh .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Experienced rangers and foresters could easily walk the length of the wall through the overgrown wild thicket in one day. By the late 14 th century DR , the wall was a long crumbling structure that stretched across the Neck's forests. Its foundations showed sight of heavy wear and decay. Most casual travelers unfamiliar with the region's history could assume that the southern part of Khalid's Wall was just huge blocks of bedrock pushed up from the ground and smoothed by the sea and wind.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The wall once had two 60 feet (18 meters) tall guard towers that rose about the rest of the structure, but by the 14 th century, they were nothing but the tallest points of the ruins. The towers' structure had a Calishite design, with the walls sloping inward as the towers rose up, ending in battlements. Both towers stood on the southern end of the wall by the forest's edge, almost reaching the Firedrake Road that passed along the entirety of the Tethyr Peninsula. With centuries passing, the towers became concealed by the forest, and most travelers passed them without even knowing of the towers' existence. A trail of crumbling mason stones led from the Firedrake Road, through the forest, and towards the crumbling watch towers.</p>
<p>By 14 th century DR, the guard towers were long-looted and held little, apart from two still functioning freshwater wells.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The construction of Khalid's Wall began in the Year of Ebon Hawks, −378 DR , in attempts by Calimshan to put a border between them and the peninsula's natives. The wall was dreamed up by an addled Calishite Pasha at the time. By the Year of Shattering, −374 DR , the construction was abandoned due to elven attacked on the builders. The wall was never completed and by the late 14 th it was a decaying ruin, sometimes used by weary travelers as shelter. Lower floors of the wall's towers could be used as a shelter, while the top floors were damaged by time and elements, offering little in terms of shelter, and posed the danger of broken floor and rotten support beams. However, both towers had functioning bake-ovens and pantry-cellars. The main danger of the wall came from the fact that bandits and brigands knew of the towers well, and the ruins offered shelter to wild beats.</p>
