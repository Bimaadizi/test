<p>The Firedrake Shores was the costal region on the Dragon's Neck Peninsula that encompassed the eastern shore of Firedrake Bay , County Kargrove , and County Greenshores .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Firedrake Shores was a relatively sheltered and secluded lush and green region. The inhabitants of the regions lived simple lives in harmony with nature. The Shores were home to many druids , rangers , and foresters. Many outsiders considered the region to be a "rude and rustic backwater," but the locals were just as judgmental of inhabitants of big, crowded, and dirty cities.</p>
<p>Along the shoreline, one could come across small turreted manors and small strongholds often called "toy keeps." Each fiercely protected the forests and their lands.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Shores' gorgeous and peaceful nature was due to Firedrake Bay being protected from winter storms and harsh sea winds by the Dragon's Neck Peninsula.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>The name "Firedrake" came from the big population of fire drakes that dwelt on the very southern edge of the Firedrake Shores. The warm sun-kissed waters were filled with a cornucopia of fish that bred freely due to little-to-none commercial fishing in the Bay.</p>
<p>The beasts and dangers along the Firedrake Road included ogres , venomous snakes, and human-hating wild elves .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The region was flush with all things green. Many traveling merchants came to this area of the world to purchase seeds and living plants. The local nature-loving population gladly traded these treasures but did not tolerate theft.</p>
<p>Firedrake Shores did not have commercial fishing done; however, its rich waters produced enough to feed the locals and passers-through. One of the local seafood delicacies was smoked jaws of fish prepared with wild herbs and berries.</p>
<p>Small hamlets along the Firedrake Road sold such mundane goods as fishing nets, apples , living snakes , wild dogs , and snake venom .</p>
<p>The sea trade was almost non-existent in the region, apart from the traffic that passed through Port Kir . Many vessels were wary of an occasional pirate keel hiding away in Firedrake Bay's calm waters.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>This region was filled with guardians of its idyllic nature. Apart from druids and rangers, many chartered heroes and adventurers build secluded homes hidden alongside most big roads who were happy to come to nature's aid when summoned. Among such group in the late 14 th century DR were Knights of the Shore , an aging group of adventuring wizards , the all-female company named the Swords of the Black Opal , and the Men of the Swift Arrow .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Firedrake Shores region was named and discovered by Calishite explorers sailing along the coasts.</p>

<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>One of the most popular local legends talked about a flying castle that fell out of the sky and was swallowed by the waters of Firedrake Bay in the ancient days. It was believed that the wild fish claimed the castle as their spawning ground. It was theories that this lost treasure was one of the floating Netherese enclaves, but none could confirm it as no sunken castle has been found as of the late 14 th century DR.</p>
