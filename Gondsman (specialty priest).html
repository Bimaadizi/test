The minor spheres that they had access to for spells were charm , creation , guardian , healing , and necromantic . Some particular spells they knew how to cast included animate object , probing arm , stoneskin , thunder staff , tree steed , and unseen servant .</p>

<p>Beyond their magical abilities, Gondsmen were often proficient armorers, blacksmiths, carpenters, engineers , gemcutters, leatherworkers, miners, potters, stonemasons, or weaponsmiths. They also all had an aptitude for all manner of devices, including mechanical locks .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Gondsmen often included lockpicks on the crimson sashes they wore, which were adorned in various tools and equipment. The armor they wore ranged as good as plate mail , though they never wielded shields . In terms of weaponry they favored bludgeoning weapons, crossbows , and firearms if they were available, such as the arquebus .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the Time of Troubles , Gondsmen were chiefly the ones responsible for the manufacture and proliferation of firearms across Faer没n , shipping them to western ports. Over time they created and introduced the arquebus, blunderbuss , and ribald .</p>
<p>Circa 1370 DR , the proportion of Gondsmen on the island nation of Lantan was about twenty for every cleric , while throughout the rest of Faer没n the proportion of clerics to Gondsmen was typically 15 to 1. The majority of Gondsmen found in Faer没n were merchants from Lantan. Around this time gnomes were also beginning to take up this vocation, though it was frowned upon in most gnomish communities.</p>
<p>Following the Spellplague , "Gondsmen" became the preferred term for both worshipers and members of the Church of Gond's clergy.</p>
