<p>Merith Baenre was a drow priestess of House Baenre in Menzoberranzan .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Merith once was the daughter of a street sweeper but her considerable clerical powers convinced Yvonnel Baenre to adopt Merith as her daughter.</p>
<p>Around 1361 DR , Merith was the second-most-powerful priestess of her House and Matron Mother Triel Baenre considered her for the next Mistress of Arach-Tinilith . However, Merith's poor capacity for protocol and intrigue and her extreme sadism changed Triel's mind and the Matron Mother searched for another candidate.</p>
