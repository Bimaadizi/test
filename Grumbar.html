<p>Grumbar ( pronounced : /ˈ g r ʌ m b ɑːr / GRUM-bar ), known as the goddess Etugen in the Hordelands , and as Grome among the duergar of Zakhara , was the elemental embodiment of earth in the Realms. He was one of the four elemental deities worshiped in Faerûn , also known as Elemental Lords , those primordials that remained on Toril when it was separated from Abeir . Nonetheless, the Earthlord retained worshipers and had power equivalent to that of a god.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He appeared as an enormous earth elemental with red eyes that glimmered like rubies .</p>
<p>To those who sought an audience with him during their visit to the Plane of Earth, Grumbar appeared in a pocket of air—on the surface of a great wall, where his face, unique to each visitor, would materialize. Presumably, for visitors from other elemental planes, there were relevant elemental pockets.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Grumbar was a quiet and resolute being, who resisted change more so than other divine powers. He bore the weight of secret knowledge and protected the great riches that were found within the earth.</p>
<p>Visitors to the Plane of Earth who sought to negotiate with Grumbar had to be prepared, for he did not bargain. They either had to accept his terms or reject them entirely—never to return.</p>
<h2>Divine Realm</h2>
<p>Under the Great Wheel and World Tree cosmologies, Grumbar dwelled within the Great Mountain in the Elemental Plane of Earth. When that plane fell into the Elemental Chaos following the cataclysm of the Spellplague , Grumbar formed a new domain for himself, called Root Hold .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Grumbar had ties with other deities of elemental earth, including Geb , Garl Glittergold , Dumathoin , Laduguer , and Urogalan , but these were loose at best. Grumbar was opposed to Akadi and her flimsy and ever-changing ways. In the battle of the archomentals of Sunnis and Ogrémoch , Grumbar secretly balanced one against the other, remaining the most powerful ruler of elemental earth himself.</p>
<p>Ogrémoch was actually one of Grumbar's children, as was his twin, Entemoch .</p>
<p>Grumbar and orcish deity Luthic were involved in a secret romance, unbeknownst to the god Gruumsh .</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Like the other elemental deities, with the exception of Kossuth , Grumbar had a minimum of followers in Faerûn. He cared little for most of these worshipers.</p>
<p>The church of Grumbar was organized into small sects known as Holds, each comprising three groups of seven members, divided by their individual skillsets, each supported by a number of lay people. Those who followed the Earthlord could often be found in public preaching against evils of boarding ships and setting sail to uncharted lands, preferring exploration on the continent of Faerûn.</p>
<p>In Faerûn , there were notable Grumbarryn temples found in various mountain ranges, including the Spine of the World , the Giantspires , and the Muaraghal Mountains . He was among the deities worshiped by the continents population of earth genasi . Among druids who honored the First Circle , Grumbar was not merely a god of earth but an embodiment of the rolling hills themselves and of the fertility of soil.</p>
<p>Among the Tuigan people the Hordelands, Grumbar was known by its many nomadic tribe as a goddess called Etugen . They believed she was the source of most blessings their people received. Such as good pastures, the growth of their herds, and protection against some diseases .</p>
<p>On the continent of Zakhara , Grumbar was called one of the cold gods of the elements . As those were seen as uncaring for human affairs, they were considered opposed to the Land of Fate's pervasive culture of Enlightenment . Only a few Zakharans were willing to worship a cold god in order to gain power. Some yak-men , ever opposed to Enlightenment, helped in the administration of Grumbar's realm on the Elemental Plane of Earth.</p>
<p>In Kara-Tur , Grumbar had another great place of worship found in the Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains .</p>
<p>An altar existed within Grumbar's Temple in the subterranean levels of Sadrach's Splinter , alongside other Elemental Lords' temples within other parts the spire, created by the elemental magic wizard Sadrach . In 1486 DR , the Earthlord received the Eye of Gruumsh on this altar.</p>
<h3>Orders</h3>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Grumbar had made only four known appearances on Toril in the annals of recorded history. The first occasion of his divine presence being known was during the creation of the Great Rift in south Faerûn .</p>
<p>During the events of the Second Sundering , in the late 15 th century DR . Luthic presented Grumbar with a gift, the Eye of Gruumsh , to reaffirm her love for Grumbar, in the wake of lies and doubts spread by the goddess Shar .</p>
