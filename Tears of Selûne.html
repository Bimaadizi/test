<p>The Tears of Selûne was an asteroid cluster, visible from the surface of Toril as following the moon Selûne in its orbit around the planet.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>From Toril, while Selûne appeared to fit within the size of a human fist an arm's length away, the Tears of Selûne extended for almost three handspans wide and three fingers deep at the same distance. From the ground, the Tears appeared as stars and were often identified as nine in number (the other bodies that made up the cluster were too indistinct to make out). The Tears were only bright enough to be seen at night, and even then they were not seen every night. The first tear appeared above the horizon about four hours after Selûne rose, and it took about three hours for the entire set of Tears to rise or set.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Tears were an ordinary asteroid cluster that trailed in the wake of Selûne. There were hundreds of them, circling each other, though the focal point of their revolution was actually a castle. The closest asteroid to Selûne lay about 100,000 miles (160,000 kilometers) from the moon, while the farthest lay about 183,000 miles (295,000 kilometers) from it. Since all Tears followed Selûne's orbit, they all stood about the same distance from Toril as the moon itself, that is, 183,000 miles (295,000 kilometers).</p>
<p>Most of the asteroids were too small to have a sufficiently large breathable atmosphere. However, several dozen had air envelopes that could sustain life quite comfortably.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa −3500 DR an astronomer from Shou Lung called Tu Pi Chei reported seeing many objects "pop" into existence. Soon, all of Toril's oceans were wracked by massive tidal waves. The Emperor was informed and the next night he too looked at the sky and saw the new objects. Twenty astrologers were tasked with determining their meaning. Most said that Shou Lung would expand inland, some said that a member of the emperor's family would soon die, one claimed that the emperor himself would become pregnant (that astrologer was immediately put to death). Shou Lung did indeed expand inland soon after and became one of the largest countries on Toril. The emperor's wife also died in childbirth later that year.</p>
<p>By 1357 DR , the true nature of these bright bodies was still unknown.</p>
<p>Despite all the legends as to their formation, the truth was that the Tears were the result of a magic-fueled weapon created by dragonkind to destroy the King-Killer Star , but when they fired it, the weapon missed and hit Selûne instead.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The elves of Evermeet took the appearance of the Tears as a sign that the gods were pleased with their magical research and viewed the Tears with pride, while the goblinoids believed that the Tears were part of a plot by human mages to bathe the night in moonlight. The goblinoids feared that the night sky would soon be filled with moons, resulting in the elimination of their precious darkness. As a result, many goblinoids set out to kill as many humans and elves as they could due to this belief.</p>
<p>Spacefarers tended to believe that the Tears were created by a deity new to the sphere to hide the castle in the center of the cluster where it lived. Many have attempted to investigate the castle but none have returned alive.</p>
<p>Most human legends told of the goddess Selûne who fell in love with a handsome warrior who turned out to be an evil shapechanging monster bent on destruction and conquest. Selûne sealed the warrior and his minions in a gem made of her life essence and wept, forming the tears that came to rest trailing the satellite of Selûne's namesake.</p>
