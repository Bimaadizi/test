<p>Beetles were insects found in many places and variations on Toril , often in giant sizes.</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>Most species of beetle lacked good eyesight or hearing. Because of this, they primarily relied upon their tactile and taste senses. The latter was done by means of their antennae.</p>
<h2>Species</h2>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>In general, these creatures were liable to eat almost any form of organic matter tasted by their antennae, even other species of beetle. Each species tended to have dietary preferences. Those that lived in the Underdark were often fungivores.</p>
<p>Giant beetles ground and crushed whatever they ate with their mandibles, making it difficult to revive consumed organisms.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Shrub beetles were found in Cormanthor . Bombardier, boring, fore, and stag beetles were typically found in midwood . A wide variety of giant beetles could be found in the Underdark.</p>
<p>Aggressive carnivorous giant beetles could be found within upper layers of Undermountain , notably, in the Garden of the Drow and nearby Temple of Bane .</p>
<p>Outside of the Prime Material plane , giant beetles could be found living in the trunk of Yggdrasil the World Ash .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Some races within the Underdark kept giant beetles as livestock. They were one of the many Underdark creatures that the duergar of Fraaszummdin raised and trained, which they used to defend their city.</p>
<p>The military of Thay sometimes outfitted its soldiers with giant beetles as mounts .</p>
