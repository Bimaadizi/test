<p>Jherremor was a ghirrash lairing in the Shadow Citadel in the Plane of Shadow in the early 1370s DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Jherremor served the cultists of Shar based at the Lost Refuge in the Vast Swamp . He was the principle guardian of the Shadow Plane–side of the Dusk Lord's Passage portal , which linked the Lost Refuge to the Shadow Citadel, and patrolled the land around. Although the Shadowscales sufficed for most lesser threats there, they could call on Jherremor to destroy any major foe. He answered to Bestra Mornscroll , albeit sullenly. To keep him satisfied, the Sharrans allowed him to have his fun with captives they did not require for their plans.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was ferocious and bloodthirsty, relishing the chance to kill and butcher captives, as well as beasts it caught in the Shadow Swamp , such as dark giant frogs . His lair was his kitchen, a gore-soaked chamber where the dismembered corpses of men and beasts hung from hooks and chains . He would mount still-struggling victims on these hooks if he could grab them.</p>
<p>He was also avaricious, and stole from his victims.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Jherremor's hoard included a fortune in silver and gold pieces, as well as amethysts and spinels of deep blue hue. He also possessed potions of barkskin and levitate , a scroll of confusion , and a brooch of shielding .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Eventually, in early Eleint of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Jherremor was encountered and presumably defeated by a party of adventurers in service to Mystra intent on ruining the Sharrans' plot.</p>
