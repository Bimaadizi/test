<p>A locust was a small and fast spaceship created and employed by the spacefaring inhabitants of Wa as a short-range support vessel of the larger tsunami spelljammers .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Locusts were made of balsa wood and were shaped like locusts . Because of their small size and weight, they were extremely fast and maneuverable, but also extremely fragile.</p>
<p>Due to their diminutive size and frailty, locusts could not be equipped with spelljamming helms . Instead, their propulsion system was a rudder of propulsion , a magic item developed by a wu jen in collaboration with a wizard from Cormyr . These rudders allowed a locust to reach spelljamming speeds when traveling in wildspace or in the phlogiston but did not provide enough power for the ship to escape the gravity of any planet larger than size A unassisted.</p>
<p>Locusts were typically employed in attack maneuvers, deployed from a tsunami to weaken or destroy a target while the larger ship stayed behind. They would either attack with a single built-in weapon or would simply ram into their targets, triggering a large explosion of their reservoir of Greek fire .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the midâ€“14 th century DR , locusts were primarily built in the Iiso spelljamming port.</p>
