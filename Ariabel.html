<p>Ariabel was a paladin devoted to the Bringer of the Dawn, Lathander , active sometime before the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ariabel's most renowned deed was when she wielded her enchanted blade Harrower against vampire Zerafex . The blood-sucking undead assembled a number of spawn under her control at some point long before the 1368 DR and Ariabel sought to end her reign of terror. Unfortunately, Ariabel perished in the battle and her corpse, as well as Harrower were left abandoned within Zerafex's crypt somewhere in Tethyr . Years later, a band of thieves found a way into Ariabel's final resting place and recovered her famed blade.</p>
