<p>Verenestra was the fey deity of female faeries, charm, and beauty. Verenestra was the daughter of Titania and one of the Inner Circle of the Seelie Court .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Verenestra could choose to appear as a demure, slim female nymph, dryad, or sylph. She was always barefooted, wearing only gossamer garments the size of handkerchiefs to provide her with a semblance of modesty. She stood 4′6″ (1.37 m) in height.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Verenestra was fickle, vain, and jealous; she disdained the company of other goddesses of beauty, love, or romance. However, she was also wise enough to know that the security of her worshipers was tied to the security of the fey as a whole. She was utterly loyal to the Seelie Court.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Verenestra's avatar could cast wizard spells of the illusion , enchantment , and elemental (excepting fire) schools. She herself was immune to all illusion and enchantment spells, and nonmagical weapons could not harm her. In her sylph form, she could fly; in her other two forms, she could swim. She could shift between those three forms instantly, whenever she wished.</p>
<p>Additionally, her avatar could cast charm person , emotion (calm) , massmorph , and pass plant at will, and liveoak , mass charm , turn wood , and wall of thorns three times each day.</p>

<h2>Activities</h2>
