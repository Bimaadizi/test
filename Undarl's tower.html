<p>Undarl's tower was a tower belonging to the mage Undarl in northwest Faerûn during the early-to-mid 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The tower lay along the Delimbiyr River , just a few miles west of Secomber , or Hastarl in ancient times. It was built on top of a rocky outcropping.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The keep had open balconies both facing outside and inside, over the courtyard, with many major towers having flat roofs and being half-round, with the round side facing outwards. The base of the walls had plinths. The structure had six interior floors and three underground levels. The bottom-most level was too damp to use. All levels but the ground level, broken by the courtyard gate, made complete circuits around the structure.</p>
<p>However, most of the aboveground structure had been reduced to a jutting stone outcropping by the late 14 th century DR , with only a basement laboratory preserved properly, with strong magic.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Shadow creatures inhabited the surrounding area, due to a leaky portal .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The tower belonged to Undarl in its day, but had since become a ruined keep.</p>
