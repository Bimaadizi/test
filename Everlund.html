<p>Everlund (formerly Besander's Blockhouse ) was a city of merchant traders and caravan teams and was one of the greatest supporters of the league of the Silver Marches . Located southeast of Silverymoon and situated on the north bank of the River Rauvin , Everlund was the second largest city in the Silver Marches and one of its most active mercantile communities.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The walled city was resettled by humans from Ascalhorn on the site of Besander's Blockhouse in 515 DR . Since its humble beginnings as a fortified trading outpost and bridgehead on the Rauvin , the city's population and importance increased so that it became one of the most important trading cities in the region.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>For nearly five hundred years, (before 1372 DR ) Everlund was ruled by the Council of Elders . This group was composed of the people holding the most prominent positions in the city, although there was occasional debate over whether some civic figures were important enough to merit a seat on the council. The council was led by the First Elder, an office granted by vote of the others. The First Elder held this position until another member challenged it; sometimes this post was held for many years, other times a few days. Kayl Moorwalker was the First Elder as of 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>One of the newspapers of note published in Everlund was Hawkblade's Evenhorn . The periodical chapbook published witty humorous recounts of local events and news of Everlund's famous individuals. The chapbook often printed gossip about the town's neighboring Silverymoon , especially focusing on the town's illustrious leader Alustriel Silverhand .</p>
<h2>Militia</h2>
<p>The city was defended by the Army of the Vale . The city's barracks and armory were located on the south bank of the River Rauvin between the Knightbridge and Dwarfbridge.</p>
