<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The Low Kitchen had at one point, a cream sauce with mushroom which smelled of nutmeg and lion meat which had been spit-seared and cut thickly, likely made under his supervision. It took him several hours to make a glazed manymeats pudding, and his sauce was lumpy, strongly implying those may have been the feats testing his abilities as a cook.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nestur Laklantur was working in the Low Kitchen one day in 1479Â DR , when the fugitives Storm Silverhand and Elminster Aumar accidentally fell into it, slipped all through the table, and bounced off his backside, pushing him into a pudding and ruining his cooking. He turned around with a ladle, against which Storm's sword bounced, saving his life, and unleashing a blast of wild magic that converted the ceiling into a solid slab of sapphire . The slab shattered and fell, stunning everyone in the room.</p>
