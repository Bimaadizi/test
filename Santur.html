<p>A santur ( pronounced : /ˈ s ɑː n t ʊər / SAHN-toor ) was a Zakharan instrument similar to the hammered dulcimer .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The santur was a favored instrument of the Pearl Cities region of Zakhara. This fact alone made its use frowned upon within the Pantheist League .</p>
