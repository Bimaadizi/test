<p>Hoyden was an elven village on the shore of Hidden Lake , isolated within the center of ancient Netheril .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The village was located at the northern end of Hidden Lake, where it met the largest and deepest body of the Hidden Forest .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The elves supported themselves with fishing and farming, but were quite isolationist and refused most contacts and deals with outsiders. Despite its insularity, the weaponsmiths managed to outdo the best that Netheril had to offer in regards to forging tools of war, and they deigned to import a little silver for their projects.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hoyden was founded in 473 NY (−3386 DR) by elves from three different nations who had sought an end to their hostilities. They were quickly beset upon by the orcs of the Hidden Forest, but a friendship with the local pixies and sylphs meant that all three were able to coordinate together and consistently overcome their orcish foes. The extreme difficulty in attacking the small village meant that the orcs preferred to strike at the much larger target of Earsome instead. Even so, small raids against Hoyden occurred every so often as the orcs tested the defenses.</p>
<p>As the Netherese colonized the region, the elves largely avoided interacting with them and so remained almost entirely unaware of the land's events. Despite the belligerent and often avaricious nature of the Netherese, the folk of Hoyden were confident that their isolation and relative insignificance would deter any major threat to their village. They were happy to host travelers in their village, but any attempts to set up trade deals were shunned. Thanks to the constant pressure of the orcs, the village's weaponsmiths became very practiced and innovative, and even developed some of the earliest examples of functional silver weapons. Thanks to this, they deigned to import silver from the Netherese. As the reputation of their weapons spread, more and more of the wanderers who visited the village turned out to be blacksmiths hoping to learn their crafts.</p>
<p>When Algid was suddenly destroyed by the phaerimms in 3374 NY (−485 DR) , the Hoyden elves took heed of what was to come and they began a migration to distant lands to the south and east.</p>
