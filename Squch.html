<p>Squch was a scaladar and self-proclaimed leader of the mechanical entities that populate Trobriand's Graveyard . He was created by Trobriand as one of his "most intellectually stimulating experiments in this century" (century not known). He aimed to break free from the graveyard and control the city of Waterdeep for himself. He used the other inhabitants to help him discover this exit. Squch could speak both Common and Drow . Unusually for a scaladar, Squch had independent will.</p>
