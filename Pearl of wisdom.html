<p>A pearl of wisdom was a magic item capable of increasing the wisdom of anyone who carried it.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Though these items appeared to be mundane pearls , a pearl of wisdom would increase the wisdom of anyone who carried the pearl for a full month. This sudden increase would occur after thirty days and remain so long as the pearl was carried.</p>
<p>One in twenty of these items was cursed, bestowing the reverse effect on whoever carried it. Once the wisdom was lost, the pearl would crumble to dust, leaving the poor target confused as to what just happened. The lost wisdom could only be restored vis a wish or by reading a tome of understanding .</p>
<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
<p>Thuba Mleen , a powerful psionicist inhabiting the Haunted Lands , carried a pearl of wisdom .</p>
