<p>Radija was a Mistress of Souls, a necromancer of the Absolute in the Moonrise Towers during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Radija wore the cult's dark-red colored uniform robes with the holy symbol of the Absolute adorning her chest and an enchanted Myrkulite scourge at her side. This human woman had dark brown skin and long curly brown hair. Her face was decorated with a painted design around her eyes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In or shortly before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Radija joined the ranks of the Absolutists. However, she never became the True Soul . Like other necromancers of the cult, she served General Ketheric Thorm and followed the deity of death – Myrkul . Because of that, Radija looked down on other cultists, especially the True Souls, who were infected with altered illithid tadpoles. Trusted servant of Ketheric Thorm's, Radija resided within the Moonrise Towers and stood guard of the towers' rooftops – the area off-limit to all. When the battle started between the Absolutists of the towers and the group of heroes who opposed them, aided by Harpers , Radija was presumed slain in the struggle shortly before the adventurers confronted and ended the unlife of General Ketheric Thorm.</p>
