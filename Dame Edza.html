<p>Dame Edza , sometimes nicknamed Dame Edgar , was a posh gnome woman who lived in Purfbin Doogrick 's home burrow in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dame Edza was in attendance of a fanciful celebration of her burrow's annual New Harvest Festival sometime before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . She was happily imbibing New Harvest Punch and anticipating the highlight of festivities â€“ hearty Harvest Stew . However, that year's event turned into an absolute disaster when a youth inventor Purfbin Doogrick presented his new Shred-o-Matic 1000 to the crowd. The accursed machinery lost control, and instead of spreading potatoes, it moved to shred guests. Dame Edza's prized wig was among the casualties of the disaster. Without it, she was as bald as a potato herself, red in terror and fury. To avoid further embarrassment and sure death at Shred-o-Matic 1000's blades, she dived into an oversized bowl of New Harvest Punch. Dame's shredded gray hairs ended up in the communal Harvest Stew.</p>
