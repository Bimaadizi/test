<p>Cromach's Smithy was a forge that operated within the town of Daggerford for well over a century.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>While it was originally located in the town's Caravan Quarter , it was relocated to the Farmers' Quarter at some point. The smithy sat along the High Road with Rogar Alley bordering its rear.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The shop was originally founded by Cromach , a human blacksmith who knew better than to compete with the local weaponsmith at Derval's Bright Blade . Cromach had something of a flair for artistry, as his wares were highly valued for their aesthetics as well as their functionality.</p>
<p>Around the Year of the Iron Dwarf's Vengeance, 1485 DR , the smithy was being run by the dwarf called Tholvar Cragjaw . He continued Cromach's legacy by crafting utilitarian metal items for Daggerford's citizens.</p>
<h2>Lore</h2>
<p>There was a saying during Cromach's times that his work was "as shaky as Wayfel 's best," referring to the the proprietor of Wayfel's Smithy .</p>
