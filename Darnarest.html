<p>Darnarest the Bladesmith was a competent wizard and a smith who specialized in creating enchanted weapons. The wizard was slain by the vengeful red dragon Kezzanamark in 1303 DR .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Darnarest the Bladesmith resided in his tower somewhere in interior Faerûn . His tower was built on the foundation of another wizard's ancient tower constructed circa 403 DR . That long-gone wizard had a connection to the elven city of Myth Drannor and created a one-way gate to the Shrine of Mystra there, though the Bladesmith did not know how to activate it.</p>
<p>He used his magic to alter the sub-levels of the tower, carving additional rooms to suit his needs.</p>
<p>It was rumored the Bladesmith's works were collected in a book called Darnarest's Guide to Enchanting Blades .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Darnarest was well known among mercenaries and adventures for his ability to craft magical weapons. This fame eventually was his doom. In the Year of the Evening Sun, 1303 DR , an adult red dragon named Kezzanamark came searching for the bladesmith who supplied a band of adventurers with weapons after they foolishly attacked the wyrm. The attackers had bragged of the magical weapons crafted by Darnarest and declared that the enchanted arms would be Kezzanamark's doom. Instead, they perished by the dragon's fire. Being a vengeful creature, Kezzanamark investigated the wizard's name. The angry red dragon and the wizard bladesmith engaged in a fierce aerial battle that ended with Darnarest bitten in half. Kezzanamark melted the wizard's tower and scattered its remnants in search of treasure.</p>
<p>Decades later, Handragath claimed that Darnarest the Bladesmith was his great-uncle and sent groups of adventurers to search for the long-dead relative's spellbook circa 1369 DR . In reality, Handragath was a member of the Cult of the Dragon and was tasked with sending unwitting simpletons into the hands of the Cult to be used as slave labor in the ruins of Myth Drannor .</p>
