<p>Shield moss was an appropriately named species of moss that grew and was cultivated for export by the hardy folk of Mornbryn's Shield .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When fresh, Shield moss was bright blue-green color. Dried up, it turned gray. The moss was still quite valuable even in its dried state.</p>
<h2>Use</h2>
<p>Shield moss was highly prized for its medicinal properties and popularity among the nobility. Amnian and Waterdhavian perfume makers paid a hefty coin for Shield moss as it was a secret ingredient used in the production of the fanciful fragrances.</p>
<h3>Food & Drink</h3>
<p>The noble folk of bigger cities of Waterdeep, Calimshan , and Tethyr fancied Shield moss as a fashionable dish. The moss was served deep-fried and smeared in various sauces or even wine-and-peahen gravy .</p>
<p>This dish was an acquired taste. The deep-fried moss was brittle. Elminster Aumar once described the experience of eating Shield moss as dining on brittle corn chips, crunching on hard dried noodles, or chewing on a mouthful of twigs.</p>
<h3>Pricing & Trade</h3>
<p>Circa 1365 DR , a handful of Shield moss was going for 4 gp in the markets of big cities, more when properly cooked and sauced. When merchants and traders traveled to Mornbryn's Shield , they often arrived by boats and barges and purchased Shield moss by a boatful. Depending on the season, production, and bidding competition, a barge full of Shield moss was worth between 50 and 70 gp.</p>
