<p>Grains of Sand were enchanted Kara-Turan shurikens what once belonged to Miri Shokiro , a warrior , whose life was long forgotten by the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Each of the Grains of Sand was a tiny thrown weapon that dealt minimal damage to its targets; however, each successful hit with a Grain of Sand had a coin-toss of a chance to afflict the target with sleep .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Grains of Sand originated from Miri Shokiro's armory. As a warrior, her deeds and life were long forgotten, leaving behind only records of the philosophy that defined Miri's life. The Grains of Sand were a perfect illustration of that philosophy that encouraged people to be like sand â€“ be invulnerable to anything but time, be carried by wind and waves, be unable to be taken hold of, and always find nooks and cracks. By the late 14 th century DR, Grains of Sand could be found sold on the Sword Coast North and by Okuzo's Imports in Westgate .</p>
