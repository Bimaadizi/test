<p>Faerûn ( pronounced : / f eɪ ˈ r uː n / fay-ROON listen or : /ˌ f eɪ ɛ r ˈ uː n / FAY-er-OON ) was a major continent on the planet of Toril .</p>
<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>The word "Faerûn" was a modified version of "Faerie", the name of the homeland of ancient elves . The term was coined by Durothil , prince of Tintageer , Faerie .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The continent included terrain that was as varied as any other. Besides the exterior coastline to the west and south, the most dominant feature on the continent was the Sea of Fallen Stars . This was an irregular inland sea that kept the interior lands fertile, connected the west and east regions of Faerûn and served as a major trade route for many of the bordering nations.</p>
<p>Next in significance was the Shaar , a broad region of grasslands in the south that, together with the Lake of Steam, separated the area around the inland sea from the coastal nations at the southern edge of the continent. To the east, Faerûn was bordered by a vast region of steppes from Kara-Tur , and in the north were massive glaciers ( Pelvuria and Reghed ) and tundra. South of the continent, separated by the Great Sea , was the sub-tropical land of Zakhara .</p>
<p>The continent included the following geographic regions.</p>
<h3>Northwest</h3>
<p>A region of wilderness, difficult winter weather, orc hordes, and barbarian tribes, this region was generally referred to as "The North", which also contained most of the " Sword Coast North ". It was a mostly untamed region that lay between the large Anauroch desert in the east and the expansive Sea of Swords in the west, north of the High Moor .</p>
<p>This area contained:</p>

<p>This region stretched from the wide Anauroch desert in the west to the eastern edge of the inland Moonsea , in the northern region of the continent. It was a region of contrasts, containing:</p>

The notable areas within this region included:</p>
