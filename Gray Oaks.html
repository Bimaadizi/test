<p>Gray Oaks was a small village of halfling farmers in the heartlands of Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gray Oaks was a prosperous village and bustling agricultural center until it was destroyed and turned into a blasted ruin populated by stubborn holdouts. After its ruination it was a quiet place of simple means, with about 20 buildings and no fortifications.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Gray Oaks was situated in the Northbank region, north of the Starwater River and south of the King's Forest , several miles west of Hilp and Calantar's Way .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Gray Oaks was formerly the largest market in Cormyr and the center of the halfling-dominated Northbank farmlands. After it was razed, Jester's Green became the main meeting place for farmers and caravans to meet, though several storage sheds were built for storing produce.</p>
<p>Gray Oaks had a reputation across Cormyr for having excellent wood craftsmen, and after it was razed it continued to be inhabited by stubborn halfling artisans. Several families of humans also made there home there, harvesting the mushrooms and mosses that grew on the rocks thereabouts. A particular kind of moss was found there that glowed, and it could be distilled into a useful substance used in making spell inks and glowing magical items.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gray Oaks was once known as Black Oaks , the "breadbasket of Northbank" and the largest farmer's market in Cormyr. It was mostly destroyed during the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR , and razed again later during some sort of magical battle involving War Wizards and an enemy force, the details of which were much exaggerated.</p>
<p>Although the village continued to be inhabited in the 1360s DR , it was a shadow of its former self. It gradually recovered over time, reaching a population of 800 by 1479 DR</p>
