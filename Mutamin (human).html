<p>Mutamin was a retired adventurer who, using his funds left over from adventuring, built the Green Griffon Inn on the road just south of Luskan . Mutamin kept some unusual clientelle, but kept something even stranger underneath his tavern.</p>
<p>He had gathered several monsters, extraplanar creatures and undead and placed them in a dungeon of his own devising, built underneath the inn and charged adventurers 500 gold pieces to try and overcome what was known as " Mutamin's Challenge " in an effort to earn themselves a full half of all the gold Mutamin earned during his adventuring career.</p>
