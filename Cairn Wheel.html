<p>The Cairn Wheel was an ancient druidic stone circle and a place of worship of Silvanus , the Oak-Father.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Cairn Wheel stood in the north-central part of the Forest of Tethir , close to the forest's northern edge, to the southeast of the town of Brost .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some hundred years before the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , a druid named Sklaerth Tholone was murdered by a band of bandits at the center of the Cairn Wheel. With his dying breath, the druid evoked Thorncall . The magic swiftly erected an impenetrable thorn barrier around the circle in a 100‑yard (91‑meter) radius. As of the late 14 th century, the skeletal remains of Sklaerth's and his four murderers still laid at the center of the circle. Stories said that the bandits were rich and perished with their wealth beside them, and Sklaerth Tholone possessed magic items sacred to Silvanus. But none risked removing the treasures from the Cairn Wheel in fear of the Oak-Father's wrath.</p>
