<p>Vierna Do'Urden was a drow priestess of Lolth of House Do'Urden in Menzoberranzan . She raised her younger brother, Drizzt Do'Urden , in his early years.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Because of the drow acceptance of harsh practices, Vierna used violence as part of her motivation in teaching her brother Drizzt his part as a male in drow society. However, she also used violence very sparingly and only when Drizzt did something wrong, whereas her sisters used violence for their own enjoyment. She tried to instill in him the mindset of unquestioning respect and obedience to and reverence of their Matron Mother.</p>
<p>Vierna showed sadness when her father, Zaknafein, was sacrificed to Lolth, and showed genuine interest when Drizzt's whereabouts in the Underdark were reported.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>House Do'Urden</h3>
<p>Vierna was the second daughter of Matron Malice , sired by Zaknafein Do'Urden , and the full-blooded elder sister of Drizzt.</p>
<p>After 1297 DR , she reluctantly took the task given to her by her mother to educate and tend the young Drizzt during his early years in House Do'Urden . After Drizzt entered the Academy , Vierna became a high priestess and began teaching as an instructor at Arach-Tinilith .</p>
<p>Vierna survived the destruction of House Do'Urden in 1339 DR .</p>
<h3>Bregan D'aerthe</h3>
<p>Prior to 1357 DR , Vierna joined forces with Jarlaxle and her half-brother Dinin of Bregan D'aerthe in order to follow her obsessive desire to kill Drizzt. She lived with Bregan D'aerthe during that time as its sole female member, known as Noamuth Lil ("The Wanderer").</p>
<p>In her search for Drizzt in 1357 DR , Vierna turned her brother Dinin into a drider because he doubted her. Soon after, Vierna was killed by Drizzt when his scimitar plunged into her chest. In the moments before she died, she forsook Lolth.</p>
