<p>Soup was a wide variety of liquid cooked and cold dishes eaten across Toril , usually made with a liquid base, which could be broth, stock , water, gravy , or milk , with added vegetables, meats, and various seasonings and herbs . It was served in inns, aboard ships, and in royal castles. Sometimes, it was thickened, pur√©ed, or clarified and it was often eaten with bread or ale . Charitable soup kitchens operated in big cities, such as Arrabar and Baldur's Gate , offering free bowls of soup to the poor and the needy.</p>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most common soup was a perpetually bubbling cauldron found in inns being cooked non-stop through the winters. They were made with roasted fowl and similar scraps added to boiling soups alongside vegetables. Fresh scraps, vegetables, and water were regularly added in as the soup boiled away for months at a time.</p>
