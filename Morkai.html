<p>Morkai the Red was a powerful wizard and the guardian of the North Tower of the Host Tower of the Arcane in the seaport city of Luskan in the mid–14 th century DR . He was murdered by his apprentice Akar Kessel on the command of Dendybar the Mottled and his associates in the Host Tower.</p>
<p>Following his death, Morkai the Red's spirit was regularly summoned by Dendybar the Mottled for advice. In Year of the Worm, 1356 DR , Morkai was summoned by Dendybar to gather information on the Companions of the Hall , specifically Drizzt Do'Urden . Dendybar withheld that he believed the drow to be in possession of the Crystal Shard , fearing that Morkai would spread the information through the planes, which would likely encourage other powerful beings, including the specter himself, to pursue the relic. Ultimately, when Morkai lost track of Drizzt at Garumn's Gorge , Dendybar failed to properly dismiss him in his fury, allowing Morkai to possess Denbybar's flesh golem Bok and used it to exact his vengeance.</p>
<p>Morkai would later inform Lady Alustriel Silverhand that King Bruenor Battlehammer , who had been presumed dead in Mithral Hall , was in need of her aid.</p>
