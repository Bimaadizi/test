<p>Nonthal was a city, reputed for being the most peaceful and stable in the nation of Turmish , in the Vilhon Reach .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The citizens of Nonthal loved the city's stability and attempted to stay out of conflicts if possible. For that reason, the numerous adventurers that passed through were often met with cold shoulder and the overwhelming stench of the town's cattle industries.</p>
<p>The city itself was quite dull in appearance. Its streets were filled with market stalls and tradesmen.</p>
<p>The city had a functioning sewer system , that was fixed, expanded, and improved by Joster Barbellow , of the Barbellow gnome family. The "Lord of the Sewers" was hired by Nonthal for the job sometime in the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Nonthal stood just north from and connected to the Turmway and the town of Centaur Bridge via a well-traveled road that continued further north towards the towns of Sambryntyn and Moonhunt Down a bit further.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The city's main trade was cattle. Nonthal was surrounded by a strong aroma of manure , slaughterhouses, and the chemical stench of its many tanneries. It served as a market town for smaller farming communities that were sprinkled around Nonthal.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The city was named after a wizard , who moved there in the early-to-mid 13th-century DR . He built his cottage behind an inn and put up signs warning people to leave him alone, then promptly disappeared. His house was quickly ransacked of valuables, and the cottage's stone walls were broken apart to be used elsewhere. Within the remnants of the home, a map to a ruin called Nonthal's Hold was discovered. The map led to a road behind the Three Trees Inn at the city's center, a sunken and heavily trapped path, as the people who traversed it quickly found. The Inn was rebuilt so as to give a commanding view of the path and soon became the center of activity in the entire city and its main form of entertainment, as onlookers bet on how far hapless adventurers seeking Nonthal's fabled stash of gold got.</p>
<p>At some point in the late 14 th century DR, a powerful mage named Fern walked Nonthal's Path, dispelling its portals with his clever spells. When he reached the destination – an old dung hole that held the final portal to the fabled wizard's lair, Fern attempted to dispel it. However, the magic traps were smarter than Fern, and they teleported him to Anauroch, across Faerûn . This attempt was witnessed and immortalized in writing by Adamar Session, bard of Starmantle . Eventually, Fern returned to Nonthal and could always be found in the Three Trees Inn, plotting further attempts.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Notably, Nonthal had a significant gnomish population, reviled only by the city of Xorhun . Many of them were illusionists by trade and made a living entertaining and pranking travelers with sparkling lights and raucous sounds.</p>
