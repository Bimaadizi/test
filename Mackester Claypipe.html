<p>Mackester Claypipe was a halfling assassin of the Night Masks in 1370 DR .</p>
<p>Mackester on the surface was the houndsmaster of House Thalavar and the most skilled canine expert of Westgate , loved both by her masters and the city's halfling community. However, she was secretly also a Night Mask assassin. Mackester was in fact also a member of a small cult of worshipers of Urogalan who believed that the god needed sacrifices, and she always remained confident in this doctrine. For this, Mackester always interred her victims underground as a sacrifice to Urogalan.</p>
