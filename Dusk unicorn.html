<p>A dusk unicorn was a rare breed of unicorn . Some fey believed that the birth of one was an auspicious omen.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Unlike regular unicorns, dusk unicorns possessed a dark coat and mane and a black horn.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Dusk unicorns, like other unicorns, could heal other creatures by touching them with their horn. Additionally, a dusk unicorn possessed a further two unusual magical abilities: they could manifest a group of dancing lights that drew other creatures towards the light, and they could teleport themselves or a group of allies up to 25 feet (7.6 meters).</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Dusk unicorns wielded their hooves and their horn as weapons; in particular, charging into an enemy horn-first was an effective tactic of theirs.</p>
