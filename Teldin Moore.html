<h2>History</h2>
<p>Teldin Moore was a tough human farmer who, as a young man, ran away from his overbearing father. He went in search of glory, and ran straight into the War of the Lance . All he found however was misery, while knights and heroes were out jabbing at dragons with pointy sticks, he was hacking up their frozen corpses and burning the meat, and digging mass graves for all their victims. When he finally returned home, he resolved to live a life of simple farm work.</p>
<p>Teldin witnessed the wreckage of a flying wooden longship fall out of the sky and demolish the farm that his grandfather and father had built. Initially believing it to be a dragon or a demon from the Abyss , Teldin soon realised that it was a vehicle and set about searching for survivors. He found only one; an elven woman. He tried to free her from the debris she was trapped under, but her long cloak obstructed his attempts, and he couldn't seem to open its silver clasp.</p>
<p>The elf woke up and started babbling in Elvish , which he only understood after she placed a finger to his lips and seemingly cast a spell. She cryptically told him to take the cloak she wore to its creators and keep it away from the neogi . She then easily opened the clasp and affixed the cloak around Teldin's neck, then perished from her wounds.</p>
<p>However another had survived the crash; a huge man with the head of a hippo, who wielded some kind of metal wand. This person introduced himself by pulling a trigger on the wand, but the device backfired, exploded, and knocked the hippo-man out with the recoil. Utterly confused, Teldin tied the hippo-man up and began searching the burning wreckage for other survivors. He found only dead bodies, but noted with interest a large chair in one of the vehicle's rooms that seems completely undamaged by the fire, with a white-robed wizard slumped nearby.</p>
<p>The hippo-man soon woke up, and Teldin quickly cleared up the misunderstanding that he did not in fact kill the captain and stole her cloak. The hipo-man introduced himself "Private Herphan Gomja of the Noble Giff " and the two established an uneasy alliance. Gomja explained that his crew were sailing across the stars before they were attacked by the neogi, evil spider aliens. The Neogi seemed to want the captain's cloak, which she had described as "her advantage", but Gomja did not know any more than that. He went on telling Teldin about the giff, that they enter military service from a young age, and want nothing more than glory or death in battle. Teldin, whose experiences of war were much less grandiose, disagreed with this outlook on life, but they both agreed to work together for the time being.</p>
<p>Soon the neogi showed up to investigate the crash site, accompanied by their "lordservants"; big pincery monsters with hypno-eyes who were later named as umber hulks . With his farm gone, Teldin decided to travel north to the city of Kalaman, where he had family who could lend him money to start rebuilding. He would also need to find a way to remove the captain's cloak, as no matter what he did the clasp would not open. Helpfully the cloak shrunk near water, allowing him to take a bath and being far less obvious.</p>
<p>Arriving in Kalaman, Teldin visited a dwarven merchant attempting to cut the clasp on the cloak, but it failed spectacularly, releasing a burst of energy that knocked everyone on their backs. Worse still, Teldin's family had left town years ago, leaving him without financial aid. While in town, many who saw Gomja the giff would stare in terror as most believed him to be either a monster from the Abyss or even worse some kind of draconian experiment. Nearing his wit's end, Teldin finally found some good fortune when a mercenary leader recognised him from back in the War. Named Vandoorm he was a mentor and father figure to Teldin. After a night spent drinking and swapping stories, he offered Teldin and Gomja a place on his crew. They decided to join up and travel to Palanthas, where there was said to be a sage who knew everything. Surely he would know how to remove the cloak, and how to get Gomja off the fearful world.</p>
