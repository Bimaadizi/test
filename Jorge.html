<p>Jorge was one of the brigands, possibly a part of the Zhentarim , who used the Fallen Crags of Icewind Dale to ambush and rob travelers and merchants in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Mirtul of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Baldryn Irontooth , a trader of Clan Firehammer , met "black-hearted swine and thieving scoundrels" as she traversed the Fallen Crags on her way from Kelvin's Cairn to Targos . She thought the group of humans not to be a danger, compared to the snow goblins and the verbeeg but she was wrong. The bandits quickly turned on her, surrounded, and made off with her mule and the shipment. Baldryn managed to escape unharmed because Jorge whined over chasing a dwarf across the tundra. The dwarf made it to safety and hoped to report the mugging and gather Targos militia to track the villains down, but ended up trapped in the city going into a lockdown â€“ the result of an influx of refugees from the other Ten Towns. Soon after, she met the Hero of Neverwinter , who sought to do business with Graendel Granitefist. Baldryn offered a generous reward for ending the brigands and returning the stolen cargo. Of corse, when the Hero and their allies found the bandits' camp, Jorge's incompetence allowed the adventurers approach the camp unnoticed.</p>
