<p>Caerwich was a small island, known to sailors as a legendary and haunted place located somewhere on the Sea of Swords .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The island had a conical shape, and was no more than a few hundred yards wide. It was perpetually covered in a blueish mist. The waters around the island hid a reef, which, combined with the mist, resulted in the area becoming a graveyard for ships that ran against it. The sailors who perished in the aforementioned ships became zombies , and would raise from the sunken ships to attack any visitors to the island.</p>
<p>The interior of the island was covered in thick bushes and ferns , which were home to many exotic birds . On the northern side of the island, an opening to the Moaning Cave was hidden under hanging moss. This cavern was round in shape, about a hundred feet long and filled with stalactites, in addition to being a dead-magic zone .</p>
<p>The island was a place mostly known through rumors and legends—very few sailors were able to travel to it and come back to tell the tale.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Apart from the zombies and birds, the only inhabitant was a blind hag , known to sailors as the Witch of the Moaning Cave .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The island was located roughly 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) southwest of the westernmost point of the Moonshae Isles . About halfway between Caerwich and the Moonshaes were the Gull Rocks .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR , Captain Deudermont upon hearing the name of the island when assaulted by a doppleganger , embarked on a journey to Caerwich with his friends. When they reached their destination, they fended off an attack from the local zombie population and received a prophetic riddle relating to Drizzt Do'Urden from the Witch of the Moaning Cave.</p>
