<p>Originally located in Scardale Town , the shop's owner, Shaliana Ghend , moved the location shortly after the second inter-dale war in 1356 DR . This allowed Shaliana to provide her goods for the country folk of the dale, though bandit attacks caused her attach a 30% markup to her prices. In 1367 DR , the shop in Scardale Town was re-opened by Shaliana's daughter Talana , and it quickly became well-stocked via regular shipments from Scarsdeep.</p>
