<p>Mend-nets was a warrior of the Ice Hunters tribe that made their home on Oyaviggaton during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was a rather untrusting individual that held a distinct distaste for the monstrous creatures that laired within his tribe's icy island-home. He detested the kobolds that laired within the isle's cave network, loathed its community of revolting ice toads , and became completely frightened by its ravenous ice troll denizens.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime during or before the 1480s DR , Mend-nets became infected with some sort of disease. He was segregated from the rest of his tribes in the monster-filled caves that wound throughout Oyaviggaton, to both keep him warm and help protect his fellow Ice Hunters.</p>
