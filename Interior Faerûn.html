<table border='1'><tr><th>Region</th><td>Faerûn</td></tr></table><br>
<p>The lands of interior Faerûn consisted of the nations, city-states and realms located along the irregular western coastline of the Sea of Fallen Stars and the Shining Plains further south. In the north the Dragonmere arm of the sea extended far to the west, ending close to the Western Heartlands . The lands of the Vilhon Reach formed around a second arm of the sea that led to the southwest.</p>
<h2>Regions</h2>
<h3>Eastern Heartlands</h3>
<p>This region comprised civilized lands on the western and northern coasts of the Sea of Fallen Stars and those surrounding the Dragonmere . It was home to many powerful human nations, along with power groups that held great influence over the Realms.</p>
<h3>Pirate Isles</h3>
<p>This rocky archipelago was located in the middle of the widest stretch of the Sea of Fallen Stars , between Sembia to the west and Aglarond to the east. The largest of these islands, named Dragonisle , had natural harbors that were home to fleets of pirates. When the waters of the sea receded during the 15 th century DR , the isles were formed and renamed to the singular Pirate Isle .</p>
<h3>Shining Plains</h3>
<p>This expansive region of grasslands, south of the Dragon Coast, was home to intelligent, four-legged creatures including centaurs and wemics . These flatlands were largely reshaped by the Spellplague, but returned to normal by the end of the 15 th century.</p>
<h3>Vilhon Reach</h3>
<p>Named after the body of water that extended from the Sea of Fallen Stars, this stretch of coastland held the independent barony of Sespech , the mercantile country of Turmish , the once-glorious assembling of city-states known as Chondath , before their destruction during the Spellplague , and the serpentine realm of Hlondeth .</p>
<p>In the 15 th century, this region came to be known as the Vilhon Wilds . It was rough-traveled, frontier land that grew over the destruction caused by the Spellplague.</p>
