<p>Montolio's cloak was a magical cloak that was named after and worn by the Mielikkian ranger Montolio Debrouchee .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The garment comprised a short-length cloak that was fastened by a unique clasp. If the two pieces were seperated, Montolio's cloak temporarily lost the magical enchantments it held.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>In addition to bolstering the inherent mental and physical defenses of its wearer, the cloak conveyed upon them some of the fighting skill that was possessed by its namesake: it allowed them to fight more effectively while wielding a weapon in either hand.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the decades after Montolio's death, the cloak and brooch were separated from one another and scattered across the Lands of Intrigue .</p>
<p>At some point before the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Montolio's cloak came into the possession of the mage Omar Harad , while the clasp was lost deep within the fortress of Watcher's Keep in Tethyr .</p>
