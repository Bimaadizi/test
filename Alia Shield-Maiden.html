<p>Alia Shield-Maiden was the wife of Halgren Death's Head and a fellow member of the adventuring company – Annals of Halgren circa the 13 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Alia Shield-Maiden was a stout, strong, and well-armored beardless dwarven woman. Her usual weapons of choice were an axe and a heavy shield . She wore a horned helmet . Alia accepted the fact that the career she chose was a bloody one, and she changed her religion accordingly. She kept a detailed journal that chronicled the adventures of the Annals of Halgren.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Alia and her husband hailed from the dwarven Bruenghor Clan of the Sunset Mountains . The duo established their adventuring group circa the Year of the Starfall, 1300 DR in order to gain wealth, fame, and reputation big enough to overshadow Halgren's disgraced family past. While adventuring with the Annals of Halgren, Alia abandoned the dwarven pantheon and adopted the faith in Tempus , the Lord of Battles. She used her clerical gifts to aid her husband in battle and heal his wounds. The name "Shield-Maiden" referred to Alia's place in battle – to Halgren's right side, his shield arm.</p>
<p>In the Year of Storms, 1310 DR , Annals of Halgren found itself in the northern city of Luskan . By that time, the troupe gained new members, Bastinado , Silence-Before-Iron , Mordakai of Thay , and Kei the Wooden Idol .</p>
