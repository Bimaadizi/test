<p>The Beast Lord was the local name given to an alhoon mage that dwelled within the ruined mines of Dekanter , carried on horrific arcane experiments, and waged a war against mostly unknown forces of the Underdark , for hundreds of years as of the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The former mind flayer known as the Beast Lord was driven mad by memories of the gith taken from the elder brain at its spawning pool within ruined Dekanter. It displayed obsessive, secretive, and maniacal behavior, seemingly wanting to conquer the the North and parts of the Deepearth .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Within the mind flayer's lair in the ruins of Dekanter, within the Greypeak Mountains of the Savage Frontier , the Beast Lord used various athanors to create twisted monsters, such as: bulettes , stegocentipedes , peryton , beholders , mongrelmen . and perhaps its most famously, the unique Dekanter goblins . It was believed that the Beast Lord's experiments in biological transmutation were an attempt to recreate the Gith species from the goblins of Dekanter, and in some twisted way please its former elder brain. By recreating the Gith the Beast Lord sought to achieve commencement , and join its consciousness to that of its former parent elder brain.</p>
<p>While pursuing its aberrant experiments and carrying out this twisted plan, the Beast Lord waged a war against some unknown forces within the Underdark, and more specifically the Deepearth . It was known to be in open war with the living illithid colony of Llacerelly , though it was entirely possible other colonies were involved as well.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Beast Lord shared his lair with the goblins of Dekanter led by Lord High Chief Ghistpok . To aid the illithid in his war in the North, the Beast Lord commanded 500 of Ghistpok's goblins along with 50 gargoyle minions.</p>
<p>After having formed an alliance with the Zhentarim , the Beast Lord fought the forces of the drow and the Harpers . Within the Dungeon of the Hark , the mind flayer had a roper ally known as Xuchallit .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Ches of the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , rumors spread about the rise of a Beast Lord in the North who used magic to create monstrous creatures, such as gorgimera and owlbears . Around the following year , the Black Network delivered dead bodies to the Beast Lord to encourage the illithid to not attack their caravans.</p>
<p>In the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR , the Beast Lord recovered the one of the Nether Scrolls of ancient Netheril , somehow connected the artifact to his great brass athanor, and magnified its experimental transformations in both their multitude and depravity. It began to create new monstrosities, Dekanter goblins merged with the awakened mantises from the nearby Weathercote Wood . Within six years , the situation grew beyond the control of the Zhent Lord Amarandaris of Parnast , and he was forced to reroute the trail leading past the mines and pull Zhentarim forces away from the region.</p>
<p>Growing concerned about the Beast Lord's increasing power while in possession of the Nether Scroll the otherworldly being known as Lady Wyndyfarh , dispatched a lost goblin from the mines named Sheemzher to enlist the aid of good folks from the nearby towns. Sheemzher joined with the honest mage named Druhallen , his bodyguard companion Rozt'a , and her foster son Tiep to steal the Nether Scroll away from the Beast Lord. The Beast Lord's powerful magic proved too much for the meager travelers, but an assault by mind flayers from Llacerelly was opportunity enough for the surface-dwellers to recover the scroll and flee from Dekanter.</p>
<p>The ancient alhoon survived the assault, and remained within Dekanter for a number of years. By the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the Beast Lord was continuing his search for ancient Netherese treasure along with his hordes of Dekanter goblins, many of which had spread far and wide in the Greypeak Mountains beyond his lair. Rumors about the Beast Lord's activities within the mountains persisted for over the following century and beyond.</p>
<h2>Rumors and legends</h2>
<p>During the reign of the Beast Lord, both the Harpers and the Lords' Alliance posted a reward of 500 gold pieces for any information concerning its heinous activities.</p>
