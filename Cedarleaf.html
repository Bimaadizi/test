<p>Cedarleaf was a wood elf settlement in the Rawlinswood of southeastern Damara , located near the Gemspark mine . It was the home village of Zhai , the half-drow daughter of a drow female and a wood elf male.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The village was a sprawling elven tree settlement. It had many magical enchantments through out that utilize the trees and roots as bridges and gates. A large inter-planar portal was located within the village as well as several magical "safe houses" the elves used in time of crisis.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The village was decimated when a githyanki general used the town's portal to begin bringing her army through. The general, Cireka , was stopped by a trio of adventurers, Rhannek , Illius and Zhai . Shortly thereafter, the slaad lord, Ygorl , teleported in with his slaad army. The githyanki and slaad forces laid waste to the village and slaughtered many of its inhabitants. If not for the efforts of the aforementioned adventurers, the town and its inhabitants might have been completely destroyed.</p>
<p>The trio returned to Cedarleaf to find the elves rebuilding their home.</p>
