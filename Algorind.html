<p>Algorind was a paladin of the Knights of Samular in Waterdeep in 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Algorind was a man who'd lost his way. His unquestioning willingness to follow superiors' orders had led him far from Tyr's path, although he remained a sincere, earnest, and dedicated man. Full of confusion, he asked for advice from Gareth Cormaeril , who was secretly the man responsible for Algorind's troubles. Thus he followed without question the orders of his tormentor.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Algorind, starting out as a very zealous paladin, was for years deceived by Gareth into trying to fulfill many futile quests. Becoming Gareth's pawn, he had orders to avoid Bronwyn Caradoon , who had worked for the opposing faction in the Thornhold affair.</p>
