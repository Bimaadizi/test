<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Matrikay learned information about a place of "absolute order"―the plane of Mechanus ―she used powerful magic to transport Delina there, with the hopes she could find a solution to her dangerous wild surges. Matrikay offered Delina a recall stone so that she could return safely, although there were some complications during her journey. The two we reunited at Knowledge-Hold after a short while, with Delina having gained much wisdom thanks to her friend's efforts.</p>
<p>Some time in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Matrikay got into a series of heated disagreements with Knowledge-Hold's head librarian, Hayley Kroe . Kroe had been acting in bizarre ways over the course of a few days, and Matrikay suspected she was destroying unique, and seemingly irreplaceable documents. When Matrikay brought her concerns to Delina, the wild mage and her fellow adventurers agreed to investigate Knowledge-Hold. They discovered that Hayley Kroe had joined some mysterious cult , and that the Knowledge-Hold had been infiltrated by devotees of some entity known as the Absolute .</p>
