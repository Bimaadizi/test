<p>The Dead Place was a stretch of forest near Starmantle that was briefly cleared of most wildlife in the Year of the Awakening Wyrm, 767 DR by the actions of Saeraede Lyonora .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The area contained a ruined town that had since become mounds and thickets, with especially large shadowtop trees.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>Saliently, the area was briefly cleared of any wildlife larger than mice in 767 DR.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The area was at the time within the formal territory of the High Duchy of Langalos , which was centered in Starmantle.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The area had a name to humans, but it had been forgotten by the 8 th century DR . After winter in the Year of the Awakening Wyrm, 767 DR , all wildlife, livestock, and people passing through the area were slain and mysteriously disappeared, leading Duke Horostos of Langalos to send adventurers such as the Frostfire Banner to investigate. The Frostfire Banner was in turn eliminated by a strange phantom mist that had taken residence in a ruined keep within the wilderness, Karsus' Keep ; this mist was the undead sorceress Saeraede Lyonora. The area slowly expanded to engulf a local town, Ayken's Stump , prompting action from the Harpers , who vowed to the Duke they'd report on the location, once the Duke could no longer find adventurers or mercenaries to investigate through his agents in Reth and Westgate .</p>
<p>After Elminster Aumar left Ripplestones that year during his long quest to cache away enchanted items as a Chosen of Mystra , he took the road to Starmantle, going straight through the Dead Place, despite warnings from locals. Ilbryn Starym , an elven wizard who was pursuing him, was also led towards that place in Ripplestones, as was the trio of Tabarast , Beldrune , and a disguised Azuth , who were also following Elminster. An ambushing force of Sharran priests, in turn, also followed Elminster to that place, after learning of his location through scrying and agents, forcing local woodsman Uldus Blackram to guide them. Elminster, in turn, came into conflict with another party of adventurers investigating the zone, only to be lured to the Keep by Saeraede Lyonora.</p>
<p>Along the way, Ilbryn Starym came into conflict with a party of adventurers and killed them all, and then with the Sharran priests, whom he fled from after learning about the ruins; the released sorceries also drew the attention of the elven mage Starsunder and his momentary guest, Umbregard of Galadorna , who teleported from Tangletrees to investigate. Their teleportation activated an alarm that the archmage Tenthar Taerhamoos had set up, bringing him to the area as well.</p>
