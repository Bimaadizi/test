<p>Incineration collars , or simply kill collars , were tools of slavery and subjugation used by the cultists of Bane in Baldur's Gate in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Incineration collars were made as a series of sharp-edged purse crystals encased in a collar chassis of gold . The crystals glowed when activated and when they resonated with the corresponding Prinski's Motivators .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Each Motivator was connected to a number of incineration collars always located nearby; once activated, they could instantly kill all the collared persons. If the Black Gauntlet dropped the crystal device, it automatically activated with some delay, killing every shackled slave around it. If Prinski's Motivator was handled by someone unaware of its inner workings, it had a chance of detonating itself, along with the nearby incineration collars .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Motivators and incineration collars were used by the Black Gauntlets of Bane under the leadership of Lord Enver Gortash to "motivate" Gondian workers of the Steel Watch Foundry to produce steel watchers around the clock. Followers of Bane, the god of tyranny, insisted that enslaved Gondians remained aware of what they were forced to do and suffered from knowing what they'd done.</p>
