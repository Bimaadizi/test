<p>A kukri was a type of heavy knife.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kukris had a single-edged, heavy blade that curved forward. This blade became gradually wider from the hilt to the end, where it quickly tapered to a sharp point. The cutting edge was all along the inside of the curved blade up to the tip.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>Due to the curved design of a kukri's blade, a wielder typically fought by slashing at their opponents. However, despite their design, a kukri was never intended to be used as a throwing weapon. The extra weight at the wide end of the blade meant they could inflict quite severe injuries. They could be used like a dagger in most respects.</p>
<p>Beyond their use as weapons, kukri were rugged enough tools that they could be used to skin game or chop wood. Thus, they easily filled many of the same roles that a standard knife or handaxe would otherwise.</p>
