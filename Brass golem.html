<p>Brass golems , also referred to as brass minotaurs , were a type of golem constructed from brass that were typically forged to resemble a minotaur . All were constructed to fulfill a singular goal, set at the time of their creation. This was typically to act as a guardian, but sometimes to carry out vengeance. If that goal became somehow unattainable they would lose their enchantment entirely and be rendered as nothing more than a statue.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Brass golems typically stood in silent vigil, acting as though they were mere statues, only coming to life upon a triggering event, such as desecration of a shrine they were created to protect. Once active they were relentlessly focused upon the perpetrator of that triggering event, though would still fight to defend themselves from any other attackers.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Some of these golems had the ability to cast maze once per day on a single target. They were immune to the effects of their own ability, as well as any similar spell . They were incredibly skilled trackers, especially when inside their maze, though only when it came to foes designated by a creator or connected to their singular goal. And they could freely enter the maze it created at any time to pursue their victim, completely vanishing from wherever they were standing.</p>
<p>When standing within this maze , the golem would slowly recover from any damage that had been dealt to it. Once their victim was slain, the extra-dimensional maze space would cease to exist, except if the minotaur themselves was still standing within it. Upon the next use of their maze ability, a new extra-dimensional space would be created.</p>
<p>Additionally, they could only be harmed by weapons with a +3 or greater enchantment . Any electricity-based effect would cause a brass golem to be rendered sluggish in movement, as if effected by the slow spell. They could partially be healed by fire -based effects, though were not impervious to harm from them. And if find the path were to be cast upon the area where a minotaur disappeared as it entered its own extra-dimensional maze , the spell would cause both the minotaur and their trapped victim to be returned.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Brass golems were outfitted with either a +3 battle axe of wounding or a +3 greataxe of wounding , both similar in effect to the sword of the same name , and were their primary means of fighting. For some brass golems, the haft end of these axes was inset with a large, flawless gem , big enough that it couldn't be easily hidden within the confines of a fist. This gem acted as a focus for an effect mimicking the spell trap the soul , which could be used once a day. Where it differed in effect from trap the soul was that those targeted would be sent to an extra-dimensional space, not unlike that created by a maze spell. These axes typically shattered upon the destruction of their brass golem.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Construction</h3>
<p>The process of creating them took around five months, in a specially prepared lab or workroom, and cost upwards of a 100,000 to 200,000 gold pieces . About 1,500 of those gold pieces were spent on the 1,000 pounds (450 kilograms) of brass needed to construct the body and 32,320 of those gold pieces would be spent on the +3 axe of wounding .</p>
<p>The 1,000 pounds (450 kilograms) of brass had to be forged from its component ores, copper and zinc . When in a molten state these ores had to have powdered diamond sprinkled into them. About three handfuls of powdered diamond were needed. The molten brass was then to be poured into a mold, holding that of a perfect minotaur skeleton, with the brass taking the place of flesh. This part of the creation process could be done by either the creator themselves or by hired hands.</p>
<p>After the golem's physical form was finished, the creator must cast a series of spells upon it. The required spells included geas/quest , maze , polymorph any object , and wish or limited wish . Either wish spell was meant to be cast last, acting as a binding agent for everything else. Additionally, some recipes called for also using the spell Mordenkainen's sword , while others called for the spell strength . If it was desired for the axe of wounding to be imbued with the maze effect instead of the golem itself, the caster would have to cast both maze and trap the soul on its gemstone.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The very first of the brass golems in the multiverse was said to have been created on another world by a mage called Relnar the Just, to avenge the death of his priestess wife after an attack and pillaging of her temple by three barbarians . According to some sources, this was a temple dedicated to Athena . Relnar planned to use a wish spell to send it back in time to the moment of the attack, but the next night, before he was even finished casting spells upon it, he received reports that the brass golem was standing guard over the temple site as it was being rebuilt.</p>
<p>Around 1374 DR , brass golems were one of many varieties of golems used as guardians inside the Onyx Tower .</p>
