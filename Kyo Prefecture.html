<h2>History</h2>
<p>The simple farmer folk of the Kyo prefecture were forced to take up arms in defense of their homes against marauding pirates, but lacking martial weapons. The man named Hideo was the mind behind the use of simple farming implements and created the first Hideo's kamas . However, Hideo lost his reputation and fortune in creating numerous copies of these enchanted kamas, which eventually found their way to the western nations of Faer√ªn by the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
