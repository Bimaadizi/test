<p>Duver Rillyn was a member of the Rillyn patriar family of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Duver Rillyn became afflicted by lycanthropy , the affliction that led him into the service of the Kozakuran vampire Cazador Szarr , the lord of the Szarr Palace in Baldur's Gate. Along with Gheris Hhune , Blaise Hhune , and other werewolves , Duver massacred a party full of influential guests at the Szarr Palace, shortly before Cazador attempted to perform the ascension ritual. The beasts and lycanthropes were likely put out of their misery by the Absolute Adversaries and the vampire spawn Astarion Ancun√≠n .</p>
