<p>The Amaese languages were a group of languages spoken by the tribes of the Ama Basin in northern Kara-Tur , and were the primary languages there. It comprised the Issacortae , Pazruki , and Wu-haltai languages, named for the nations that spoke them: Issacortae , Pazruki , and Wu-haltai .</p>
<p>Each of these languages was a family of dialects descending from a common ancestral tongue. The three nations had little writing or centralization, so each language developed independently.</p>
<p>These languages were considered to be "only vaguely related" to the Eastern Imaskari languages group.</p>
