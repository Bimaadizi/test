<p>Bartley was a shopkeeper in Baldur's Gate around 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Bartley was a crusty old drunkard with a deep voice.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bartley set up his store inside the Elfsong Tavern with the permission of its owner, Alyth Elendara .</p>
<p>When the adventurers Adrianna , Vahn , and Kromlech first spoke with Bartley there, he opened with business news. As the heroes visited his shop, Bartley boasted of keeping equipment crafted by the dwarves of the Sunset Mountains . As the adventures returned to his shop periodically, Bartley would say various things about the heroes' missions or would often offer different sales pitches.</p>
<p>Soon after Adrianna and her fellow adventurers disappeared, Bartley began doing business with a group of six new heroes who helped Randalla Brasshorn , Bartley's acquaintance. During that time he also hired a goodly dwarven artisan â€“ Durbem , who repaired and worked on custom-made equipment for Bartley's customers.</p>
