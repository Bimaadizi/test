<p>Telflamm was usually considered to be the biggest and most important port city in Thesk ; however, Telflamm was actually an independent city-state with subject-cities of Nyth and Culmaster under its control. Telflamm wielded so much power and influence over the country of Thesk that it might as well have been the capital.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Telflamm was a walled city with skyline dotted with numerous temples and civic buildings, all constructed in a distinct onion -shape. Telflamm had one of the most prominent harbors in the Reach as it could hold over forty huge naval vessels. The city-state's harbor was built atop a submerged cliff that was the seat of power in the region in the days of antiquity. The cliff cracked by an ancient magical incident and almost completely sank at the bottom of the Easting Reach.</p>
<p>Shemszarr Square was at the center of the city's commerce. Many of its merchants and trading company headquarters were located around the square, including the Thayan Enclave . Shemszarr Square stood just to the north from the Temple of Waukeen and Castle Balindre, which was perched high on a cliff above the waters of Heskel Cove . The square was separated from the Castle by the Old Gate. To the east from Shemszarr Square stood the House of the Master's Shadow , a temple of Mask .</p>
<p>Heskel River flowed into Heskel Cove. At least two bridges were strewn across it, towards the Merchants' Fortress on the river's saunter bank. Even further south from Heskel River stood the Temple of Shaundakul .</p>
<p>The Shou Town was Telflamm's poorer quarter, situated on the outskirts of the city's southern border, behind a wall. The great structure of the Shou Gate separated the quarter from greater Telflamm; it was decorated with golden lamps fashioned to resemble dragons . The Shou Town was decidedly more eastern in nature. The architecture was distinctly Kara-Turan , the businesses and the people were mostly Shou . The quarter was built by merchants, immigrants, and refugees from the eastern realms. Few major merchants could be found here, and most residents lacked wealth and luster but compensated for it in kindness. The only exception was the yakuza gang of the Nine Golden Swords .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Telflamm stood on the eastern shores of the Easting Reach of the Sea of Fallen Stars , to the north of the Aglarond peninsula , and west of Thay . Its most important feature was being on the terminus point for the prosperous Golden Way that ran further east.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>In the city's early days, Telflamm was ruled by the members of the noble House Balindr . The hereditary rule ended with the death of the family's last scion, and the governing shifted to full oligarchy. After that, Telflamm and other smaller cities of Thesk were governed by Marchant Princes or Merchant-Mayors. The power structure was shaken by the Tuigan wars of 1360 DR and led to several conflicts among those in positions of power. However, the rulership of the Marchant Prince or the Grand Prince in Telflamm remained, but his power and status were recognized only within the city itself. The Marchant Prince did not hold all the power. The merchant council and numerous guilds controlled a significant share of power, more significant than the Marchant Prince's and the city's nobility.</p>
<h3>Laws</h3>
<p>Telflamm collected tariffs from goods being moving along the Golden Way. However, Telflamm did not amass significant wealth from tithes and tariffs despite abundant trade. Lax laws and common pirating raids contributed to the lack of wealth, especially when compared to cities of the North Faerûn .</p>
<p>Even during the pirate reign, piracy was illegal in Telflamm and punishable by death. Smuggling charges led to hefty fines and confiscation. These laws were a mere technicality as many of the pirates were allowed to act as "importers of rare goods" by the city's Merchant Princes and the council.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Trade was the most important aspect of life in Telflamm. Its busy port was a bottleneck for all trade that moved to and from the east. The city did not have to produce much. Most of the food and grains were imported. Almost all the collected wares traveling along the Golden Way came through its gates. Eastern silk , spices , smokepowder , Long Jing tea , and works of art passed through Telflamm to reach the rest of Faerûn. Telflamm acted as a duty-free seaport for neighboring Thesk's relationships with trade allies. The city was also home to the biggest Thayan Enclave ever built, making the city a hub for the purchase of magic items. Telflamm had a small shipwright industry and was known for quality, yet cheap, sails that sold well.</p>
<p>Telflamm maintained friendly relationship with its neighboring Impiltur . Despite historic hostilities and trade rivalry, Telflamm and Thesk remained on good terms and jointly guarded the prosperous Golden Way . This well-maintained road began (or ended in) Telflamm and led all the way to distant Kara-Tur . The Golden Way was a major overland trade artery. Its existence was the primary reason that Thesk wasn't simply part of the Great Dale or Thay. Telflamm also supported Aglarond and Thesk against the nation of Thay .</p>
<p>Apart from trade, Telflamm's harbors were a major travel port for adventurers seeking fame and wealth in the Eastern Realms. Telflamm (or, to be more precise, Shadowmasters of Telflamm) made coin on outfitting thrill-seekers with treasure maps of Raumathar and Narfell . These maps varied in accuracy and often led to long-looted sites.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>The cultural influences of Shou Lung were obvious in the city. One of the best teas in all Thesk was Telflamm's West Lake Dragon Well, or Long Jing. Visitors to the city's Shou Town could experience a slice of Kara-Turan life. The area had eastern architecture and was home to many Kara-Turan and Shou eateries, inns, and taverns.</p>
<p>Among many languages spoken in Telflamm was a human dialect – Larach , of the old Great Dale , notable for its sonic resemblance to the Scottish Gaelic of the world known as Earth . By the 15 th century, the dialect was largely forgotten, apart from a few phrases. Larach's influences could be attributed to gnome and halfling dialects of the Inner Sea east due to some similarities in sound.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Telflamm commanded an army of mercenaries that were dispatched to patrol the city, its satellites, and the Golden Way. During the time of war, Telflamm kept its army within its territory and hired additional mercenaries to send to Thesk's aid. After the war, Telflamm had little heavy defenses, no siege engines , nor harbor chains.</p>
<p>The city watch of Telflamm was outfitted with the uniform of long red overcoats, tied around the waist with shiny black sashes . The guards' heads were adorned with high black square hats tassled in silver. Their boots were made of black leather and ended in silver toecaps. The weapons carried by the watch were curved broadswords . The watch was stationed in Castle Balindre , close to the city's rulers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Telflamm was settled in the Year of the Fearless Peasant, 926 DR by Windyn Balindre , who moved his base of operations from Impiltur to this newly-built settlement and declared himself 'Merchant Prince', a hereditary title. House Balindr's own company, Royal Company of Shou Lung , established most of the Golden Way. Situated at the start of that incredibly profitable trade way, Telflamm quickly became the biggest trading station in the region, with most trade concerning the products of Kara-Tur which was in wide demand across Faerûn.</p>
<p>Telflamm was later established as a royal city-state in the Year of the Bent Coin, 975 DR , after annexing cities of Nyth and Culmaster . This birthed the nation of Telflamm.</p>
<p>The thieves' guild of Telflamm was established in the Year of the Red Rain, 927 DR , later to become the infamous Shadowmasters of Telflamm . In the subsequent years, the guild's influence was so great to prevent the Hierarch of Telflamm from officially joining the nation of Thesk. The Hierarch was convinced by the guild that Telflamm was snubbed by the leaders of Phsalt and Milvarune , electing to remain independent and kept its satellite cities of Culmaster and Nyth.</p>
<p>Around the 900s DR, Graldor "One-Hand" , the leader of the adventuring Company of the Collar , entered the city of Telflamm. He proceeded through the streets of the city, weeping and carrying the body of his lover, swordmaid Evlanna . The mourning adventurer entered the Tower of Tempus begging for Evlanna's resurrection . Graldor paid for the service with his unique blade – Galathos that was believed to have been lost for over two centuries. The story of the weeping adventurer and his lover became a well-known tale among inhabitants of Telflamm.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Majesty, 1177 DR , Telflamm announced its independence after Princess Delile Balindre renounced loyalty to the one-time ally nation of Impiltur .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Deep Moon, 1294 DR , Telflamm's throne belonged to Prince Thaum Balindre , son of Kuskur Balindre . His main contribution to the history books was the assassination of his uncle– Lashilmbrar “the Sly” , son of Imphras II .</p>
<p>A grand temple heist, letter known as the Night of the Fontshuffle , happened in the Year of the Boot, 1343 DR . Shadowmasters were expanding their influence and demanded more protection money from the temples of Telflamm. Those who refused found collections of holy relics and divine magic items strewn across each other temples as a show of force and intimidation tactics. The Night of the Fontshuffle was enough to convince all temples of the city-state to pay.</p>
<p>The Year of the Crown, 1351 DR welcomed the Red Wizards of Thay into the city-state. The enclave rapidly grew and became the biggest distribution center for Thayan magical goods across the northern Faerûn.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Dragon, 1352 DR , a new High Priest of the Tower of Tempus, the High Priest and Champion Rampant of Tempus Taeron , took office and promptly refused to pay the Shadowmasters' protection racket. In retaliation, Shadowmasters pulled a daring heist and claimed several magic items: two enchanted swords , (including Galathos ), a helm of brilliance , and the Red Book of War , a priceless relic of the Tempuran faith. These items sparked internal struggle within the thieves' guild, which resulted in several members' deaths. Soon after, Tempuran clergy reclaimed the stolen magic items; however, the Red Book was lost, thought to have been taken somewhere far away from Telflamm. Galathos was believed to have been recovered as well, whoever, in truth, it was still being actively searched for as of the late-14 th century DR.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR Telflamm became an integral part of the war between the invading Tuigan Horde and the united armies of Faerûn under the command of King Azoun Obarskyr IV . The free city of Telflamm initially served as a rendezvous point for Azoun's Cormyrean ships and some of the Alliance armies. From there, King Azoun planned to move north and join with troops of King Torg mac Cei of Earthfast and temporary allies – Zhentil Keep . The harbors of Telflamm took on around two hundred ships of the Alliance and supplied them with horses , livestock, mobile forges, and other general supplies. The invasion forced many unlikely and shaky alliances, including one between Telflamm and Tammar . Azoun Obarskyr's Alliance forced returned to the city-state of Telflamm after strengthening its ally numbers, of orcs , dwarves, and humans of various nations. By that time, refugees flooded the city as the Tuigan Horde approached Thesk, looming only 500 miles to the east. The influx of refugees brought out Telflamm's vice, corruption, thievery, and crime were on the rise, black markets exploited the need for food and cloth, and even started dealing in human lives. Makeshift coliseums and brothels sprung through Telflammm, leaving the city guard undermanned and prone to bribery and corruption. The Alliance army took Telflamm's government offices as a temporary headquarters. With armies of the Alliance assembled, King Azoun's forces moved east to face Yamun Khahan 's Tuigan Horde. The Crusades resulted in Tuigan defeat; however the war left Telflamm overflowing with refugees, and its security weakened for years that followed. The Tuigan invasion left Thesk a ruined and desolate land as their armies moved along the Golden Way.</p>
<p>Another fallout from the Tuigan war was the Pirates of the Fallen Stars, who seized on Telflamm's weakness. The pirates knew the city had no naval power and rolled in to create a safe haven for themselves. In the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR , Telflamm meekly welcomed the pirates of the Sharkjaws flotilla under Evgruth the Red 's command and the significant wealth they brought along. With time, an overwhelming number of pirates took over harbors of Telflamm, and their presence began to interfere with the Golden Way trade. The pirates, crime levels, and the ongoing refugee crisis turned public opinion against the ruling Merchant Prince and the merchants' coalition. Telflamm's collapse seemed inevitable. The Shadowmasters, in the meantime, went through internal changes as their patron deity Mask lost his intrigue portfolio to Cyric the Mad God. In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , the new young Guildmaster of the Shadowmasters – Keshna Finlothleer , led the group into a more aggressive role in Telflamm. The thieves accumulated arms and weapons and seemingly slew the pirates on land and in the sea in a single night to avoid further interference with the city's trade. This massacre resulted in a large number of ghost ships that haunted the Sea of Fallen Stars.</p>
<p>The Shadowmasters' ambitions' next target were the orc marauders who stayed behind after the Tuigan war. The guild offered a bounty on the heads of any orcs roaming Thesk. Soon, the security was bought back to the Golden Way. In a similar manner, Shadowmasters exerted pressure on the Merchant Prince and the council, displacing refugees away from Telflamm via a promise of land. The refugees were promised that any land they were to build a home on and live on for a year would become their property. By the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the Shadowmasters were the absolute power in Telflamm, though few knew how powerful they really were.</p>
<p>On Midwinter of the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , a strange ice storm raged along the eastern shores of the Sea of Fallen Stars. The foul weather has awoken many ghosts and sea zombies of dead pirates who attacked the city-state of Telflamm. The Church of Tempus successfully drove the undead horde back into the sea.</p>
<p>The last Balindre Prince died some time during or after the Spellplague , leaving the Merchants' Council in charge of the government, but the Shadowmasters remained the true power in the city.</p>
<p>At some point before the Second Sundering , a notorious Turami pirate Anton Marivaldi , pulled a daring plundering of priceless spice fleet from the city-state of Telflamm. Some called this act "mad".</p>
