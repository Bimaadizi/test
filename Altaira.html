<p>Altaira was a young female Llewyrr elf from Sarifal on the Moonshae Isles as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She had yellow hair and almond-shaped eyes.</p>
<p>She was known to dress in white clothes with rainbow embroidery, possibly made by gnome slaves .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was not brave: she was horrified and terrified of violence and was scared of the dark. She cared for her father and for herself, but had perhaps begun to experience some of the arrogance and emotional apathy that accompanied the long lifespans of her people. She spoke in a tone of voice that was equal parts fragile and haughty.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She was the daughter of Lord Mindarion , an esteemed member of the Knights of Synnoria , who pushed her to be braver. She was first cousin to Lady Amaranth , the half- le Shay princess of Sarifal, by way of her father's brother.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Altaira hailed from Synnoria on the island of Gwynneth . Following the death of her uncle at the hands of the le Shay Prince Araithe , her father had committed his life to overthrowing the le Shay rulers of Sarifal and to installing his niece, Amaranth, in their stead. By the late 1470s DR, Altaira was party to this plot, and joined her father at the conspirators' hideout in Harrowfast .</p>
<p>After her father suffered a grave injury while overexerting himself in battle against a drow darkwalker , he lapsed into a semi-comatose state in which he was barely awake or aware of his surroundings. This occurred just as he had brought together humans and fomorians to discuss an alliance against the le Shay, but without Mindarion to head the negotiations, the talks collapsed. All the while, Altaira sat her father, fussing over him and applying ointment to his ashen face. When violence broke out between the parties, her father was roused from his stupor by the gnome Suka , and elected to side against his brethren. He instructed Suka on how to trigger a trap that would evacuate them and the fomorians to the Underdark , and although she was terrified, Altaira stayed by her father's side and was taken along with them into the darkness.</p>
<p>In the tunnels, she witnessed the resilience of the fomorians and heard her father express his frustrations with the failings of their people. He then resolved to abandon Synnoria and travel aboard to find something worth caring about, and offered Altaira the option to join him. The offer terrified her, and she wept. However, she would accompany him and the fomorians as they travelled north with the intention of finding a ship to leave the island.</p>
