<p>Calindra was a female human of Port Llast on the Sword Coast North in the 1370s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Calindra was a miner, who came from Amn in search for work. She had a partner named Bradly , who went missing.</p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>The Kalach-Cha and the companions could encounter Calindra in the Alliance Arms Inn , who would ask them to find Bradly. Bradly was actually taken by gnomish werewolves who wanted to make him a werewolf as well, but left him dead in a cave in the Duskwood , where he could be found. They could report back to Calindra if they discovered the miner's fate.</p>
<p>After the Kalach-Cha became the Captain of Crossroad Keep , Calindra could have been employed as a miner to dig through the ore mines that the Kalach-Cha could find on their travels.</p>
