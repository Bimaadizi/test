<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Baldryn had a friendly relationship with Graendel Granitefist whom she did business. She also loved Queen Gimla Firehammer and harbored some romantic feeling towards the woman for the Queen's no-nonsense attitude, strength, and kind words, when they were needed.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Mirtul of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , as the Ten Towns and the Dwarven Valley were facing looming ancient evil, Baldryn's shipment of goods meant for Targos's Graendel Granitefist, was stolen. On her way to Targos, crossing the Fallen Crags , Baldryn Irontooth met "black-hearted swine and thieving scoundrels". She thought the group of humans not to be a danger, but she was wrong. The bandits quickly turned on her, surrounded, and made off with her mule and the shipment. Baldryn managed to escape unscathed and made it to Graendel's shop. The dwarf hoped to report the mugging and gather Targos militia to track the villains down, but ended up trapped in the city going into a lockdown â€“ the result of an influx of refugees from the other Ten Towns. Soon after, she met the Hero of Neverwinter , who sought to do business with Graendel Granitefist. Baldryn offered a generous reward for ending the brigands and returning the stolen cargo.</p>
