<p>Severin Silrajin , usually known simply as Severin , was the Red Dragon Wyrmspeaker and the main leader of the reformed Cult of the Dragon in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Severin was a true visionary, bringing new life and power to the Cult. However, he was also young and prone to underestimating his enemies or not seeing enemies posing as friends.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Unlike other members of the Cult of the Dragon before him, Severin believed that living dragons earned the devotion of the lesser races, rather than those that were undead .</p>
<p>Severin also had a notable interest in the Wyrmskull Throne , the massive artifact associated with the rule of giantkind .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The cult leader was quite intelligent and was well-versed in multiple languages including draconic and infernal .</p>
<p>At the apex of his power and abilities, Severin acted with a charismatic authority akin to dragonkind and possessed supernatural resistance to harm and the elements. He could readily manipulate flames at will, teleport himself and others in a fiery inferno, and could bind others in magical chains associated with the Nine Hells .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>During his travels across the Realms with the cult, Severin came into possession of the Red Dragon Mask . He later combined it, along with the other dragon masks , to form the Mask of the Dragon Queen .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The charismatic cult leader attracted many allies to his cause, including the five powerful wyrmspeakers, and many chromatic dragons . Notable among those dragons were Vartilingorix , Chuth , and even Lostmauth , one of the three red dragon tyrants that ruled over the isle of Tuern in the Trackless Sea .</p>
<p>He was however still opposed by some members of the cult's "old guard", including the Wearer of Purple Ixas .</p>
<p>Severin had a pseudodragon familiar named Nelvik .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As a young Calishite member of the Cult of the Dragon, Severin was inspired by Tiamat to carefully reread the version of Maglas 's Chronicle of Years to Come —translated by Sammaster as "naught will be left save shattered thrones with no rulers, but the dead dragons shall rule the world entire...—and ultimately came to believe that the correct translation was "naught will be left save shattered thrones, with no rulers but the dead. Dragons shall rule the world entire...", a translation that many sages believed correct but heretical with respect to Sammaster's words. Thus the beings that should be the targets of their devotion were not dracoliches but living dragons . Armed with this new conviction, Severin decided he needed to meet and speak to a living dragon.</p>
<p>He went to Mintarn , to the lair of the famous dragon Hoondarrh . Severin managed to befriend the terrible dragon, impressing both Tiamat and his fellow cultists. Thus, Tiamat gave him knowledge of the dragon masks , which could be combined into a powerful artifact called the Mask of the Dragon Queen . Severin discovered the whole history of the dragon masks and in long years of travel he recovered all five masks. These he gave to his most trusted friends, and saved the Red Dragon Mask for himself. With a reputation gained from this search, Severin quickly rose through the ranks of the Cult until he became the main leader.</p>
<p>During the 1480s DR, Severin began a plan to summon Tiamat into Toril to bring Maglas's prophecy to pass. He also allied with the exiled Red Wizards of Thay to gain the magical power necessary for the ritual. Severin's quest to retrieve the dragon masks took him and his allies from Icewind Dale , to the Lair of Lostmauth on Tuern , and back to the mainland of Faerûn .</p>
<p>Severin's plans very nearly came to fruition: after gathering a treasure hoard worthy of Tiamat and assembling an army of dragons and other evil creatures to, he used the souls of hundreds of prisoners to raise Tiamat's Temple from Avernus into the Well of Dragons and began the ritual to summon Tiamat herself into Faerûn . He and his forces were ultimately defeated by the army of the Five Factions and their metallic dragon allies, and Tiamat was banished back to the Nine Hells . Severin himself was captured by a band of adventurers that included Alaeros Margaster and Nymmestra Durothil among others.</p>
