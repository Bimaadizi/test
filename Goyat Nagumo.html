<p>Goyat Nagumo was a general of Shou Lung in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Goyat Nagumo was a young and promising general who was promoted a number of times by the Minister of War Kwan Chan Sen .</p>
<p>Circa Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) , the Emperor sent him to Chu' Yuan province, which was troubled by mysterious assailants. General Goyat launched a campaign but always the assailants eluded his troops. Even after establishing martial law in the province, the insurrection could not be stopped, so Goyat began to suspect that the center of evil was the palace of the provincial Governor Kawabi .</p>
<p>Fearing he would be exposed, Kawabi escaped after sending letters to the Emperor blaming Goyat for martial law and executing magistrates. The armies of Kawabi and Goyat Nagumo clashed near the city of Hui and the general defeated the governor. Kawabi however escaped and Goyat followed him, resolved to make him pay for his treason. The long pursuit and the many difficulties encountered made Goyat half-mad.</p>
<p>Goyat finally confronted and defeated Kawabi for good at Tempat Larang . Kawabi was executed but Goyat was corrupted by the dark spirit of the citadel. He declared himself a ronin and sought to create a new empire with himself as its head. Goyat found the army of stone warriors that Kawabi wanted to use but discovered that only a blood relative of the Emperor could command them.</p>
<p>With help of dark spirits, General Goyat managed to manipulate Emperor Kai Tsao Shou Chin into hiring some adventurers, among them the Emperor's blood relative, to find Goyat.</p>
<p>When the adventurers arrived in Tempat Larang, Goyat Nagumo engaged them using the powers granted to him by the dark spirits, splitting into three different manifestations. After a fierce battle, Goyat was defeated and killed. As a back-up plan, Nung Chiang of the Nine Immortals was prepared to cause Mount Tengkorak to erupt to destroy the citadel.</p>
