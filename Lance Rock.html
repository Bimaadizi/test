<p>Lance Rock was a stone monolith outside of Red Larch , a few miles west of the Long Road . This landmark was 25 feet (7.6 meters), slender, and made of stone unlike any found in the region.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Lance Rock was located about 15 miles (24 kilometers) southwest of Red Larch and stood on an open plain. It could be seen from miles away when the weather was clear. It was gray granite , had nothing noticeable growing on it, and leaned to the east at about 30 degrees from vertical.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in the distant past, the green dragon Claugiyliamatar (better known as "Old Gnawbone") noticed a young red dragon (named Smergadas ) had invaded her territory and gorged himself on the local wildlife. As he slept off his overindulgence, she brought this enormous lance of stone all the way from the Sword Mountains and dropped it on the invader. By the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR , there was no trace of the vanquished dragon, but Lance Rock still stood.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>In 1491 DR, some folks in Red Larch believed Lance Rock had an evil presence that caused a plague to threaten the town.</p>
