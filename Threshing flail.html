<h2>History</h2>
<p>Since the earliest days of warfare, farmers that were recruited to fight would often utilize threshing flails as a sort of bludgeoning weapon. Over time armorers and other weaponmakers would develop variations intended solely for the purposes of warfare. One was the horseman's flail , which used sturdy chains and weights made of iron or wood that were covered in short spikes.</p>
<p>On Toril , this started to occur sometime before 1265 NY (−2594 DR) , when military flails first became available in the Netherese Empire .</p>
<h2>Notable Users</h2>
