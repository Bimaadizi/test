<p>The River Shaar was a significant body of water in the land of Shaar and was the largest river in the Underdark .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The River Shaar originated from the Riftlake in the Great Rift , an icy-cold body of clear fresh water. It moved a short distance along its valley floor in a snake-like pattern, until ending abruptly at the Great Rift's northern end, abruptly plunging down a gorge 300 feet (91 meters) deep into the Great Bhaerynden region of the Underdark . This waterfall was known as the Deepfall .</p>
<p>Thousands of feet below the surface, it winded along a subterranean route for over 100​ to ​150 miles (160,000​ to ​240,000 meters), along the way passing through various caverns, fissures, and subterranean lakes. It eventually emerged emerged once more on the surface through a broad cavern set into the base of the Landrise , a great cliff face that divided the Shaar.</p>
<p>Out from the Landrise, the River Shaar winded its way west across the lower Shaar, cutting a wide but gentle course that was relatively shallow, with many fords along its lengths. As it began its passage by the Shaarwood , the River Pelevar fed into it. Eventually after passing by the Shaarwood, the River Shaar widened out into a body of water known as Lake Lhespen , and from there it flowed south into the Shaareach Forest . In the middle of that wooded section of the Channath Vale it merged with the River Channath to form the River Talar .</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>Some fish could be found swimming through the River Shaar. These were most of the channel variety and bottom feeders, the type of fish that preferred its sluggish currents.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The waters of the River Shaar notably retained the icy cold and crystal clear quality of the Riftlake, going uncontaminated throughout its journey from Riftlake to the Landrise. The river also flowed strongly year round, being one of the few in the Shaar that didn't severely dwindle during the hottest time of the year.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Many of the nomadic tribes that inhabited the Shaar relied upon the river for sustenance. Beneath the surface, gold dwarves channeled some of the River Shaar's water into their Deep Realm for the purposes of drinking, sluicing in their mines, and as a means of providing them an easier means of transportation through parts of the Great Bhaerynden. They made a concerted effort not to contaminate its waters with the waste products of their forges, taking great pride in doing so.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Over the years the River Shaar wore away caves it passed through in the Underdark, carving out a tremendous maze-like network.</p>
<p>In the Year of Willing Sacrifice, 435 DR , numerous towns that stood along the River Shaar and Lake Lhespen revolted against the puppet rulers that had been installed by the Shoon Imperium and the imperial garrisons that backed them. These colonies were first to defy the rule of distant Shoonach and ultimately won their freedom, slaughtering their puppet rulers and their soldiers. However, this state of independence would be short lived, as two years later in 437 DR the ruling Qysar Amahl Shoon VII sent seventeen troop ships to quell the uprising, thus beginning the Seven Burnings Campaign .</p>
