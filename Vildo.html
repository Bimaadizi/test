<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Vildo followed his uncle's example and joined the Flaming Fist of Baldur's Gate. When the Absolute crisis struck the Gate, Vildo received his long-awaited promotion to the rank of Gauntlet, of which he eagerly informed his now-retired uncle via a letter. The nephew and his uncle were to meet at the Singing Lute in the Lower City to celebrate Vildo's promotion and watch the scenic sunset over the Seatower of Balduran . Vildo promised to get the "old man" back to his home before the uncle's bedtime.</p>
