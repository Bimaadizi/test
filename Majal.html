<p>Rising Princess Majal was the daughter of Prince Priam of the House Tethyr who lived more than 200 years before 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Majal's life tragically ended in her family's estate â€“ Carlsmere , located on The Bite of the Dragon's Head Peninsula . During a dire storm, more than two hundred years before the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Prince Valys smothered his older brother, Prince Priam, along with royal children, Majal and her brother Vyshan . With the murders, Prince Valys ensured the crown was to be passed on to him from his great-grandfather Alemander I . However, Majal and her family's deaths were avenged by Priam's younger brother Coram III .</p>
<p>By the late 14 th century, Carlsmere was an abandoned estate, still haunted by ghostly apparitions of those unjustly killed there. Rising Princess Majal and her brother could occasionally be heard or seen confusingly weeping and stumbling through the ruins and the manse's playhouse, seeking warmth and comfort in cold undead existence.</p>
