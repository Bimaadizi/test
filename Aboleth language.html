<p>The Aboleth language was the language spoken by the aboleth , large fish-like aberrations with an array of psionic abilities.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Aboleths utilized an exceedingly intricate language that presented substantial challenges for creatures with only a single mouth. Aboleths articulated through multiple vents located on their flanks—openings that also served for respiration and the expulsion of mucus into the water. The expression of basic aboleth words necessitated the use of just one such orifice, whereas more complex terms or ideas demanded the engagement of additional vents for accurate pronunciation. The most scholarly aboleths possessed a greater number of these oral structures compared to their less gifted counterparts.</p>
<p>Creatures with only a single mouth may attempt to speak Aboleth, but their capabilities were confined to simpler words unless they resorted to mimicry of complex sounds using tools such as flutes , bagpipes , or large brass instruments like tubas and trombones . To an aboleth, however, such efforts typically denoted a lack of sophistication and intelligence.</p>
<h2>Names</h2>
<p>Names within aboleth society, whether for individuals or their cities, ranged from the exceedingly complex to the deceptively simple. There was often no distinction between the name of an aboleth and that of its city; frequently, a city bore the name of the aboleth who established it. Examples of typical aboleth names included Dupapn, Mavad’Nidhuned, Nevek’Dithasig, Sochsna, Torop’Jethixur, and Urdol.</p>
<h2>Writing System</h2>
<p>The script of the aboleths was elaborate, comprising hundreds of thousands of detailed glyphs reminiscent of abstract hieroglyphics. Aboleths inscribed these glyphs on stone or metal surfaces using small, thimble-like crystal devices that attach to their tentacle tips. These crystals were dipped into dense acids, which resisted dilution by water, to etch the runes directly onto the substrate. Utilizing all four tentacles simultaneously, aboleths achieved a level of efficiency in writing that creatures with fewer limbs could not match.</p>
