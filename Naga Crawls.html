<p>The Naga Crawls were a series of caverns in the Deep Wastes noted as the lair of a trio of spirit naga .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Naga Crawls were located 52.5 miles (84.4 km) east of Szith Morcane at the end of a branch of tunnels through the Deep Wastes .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A roughly 150-ft-deep (45.7 m) set of caverns, the ceiling of the Naga Crawls was about 8 ft (2.4 m) in height at the entrance and only 4 ft (1.2 m) high further in. Cold streams of water wound their way through the Crawls, trickling into shallow pools at the deepest parts of the cavern. A single rusted iron ladder provided the only means of entrance from the tunnels of the Deep Wastes to the narrow caverns above, the stream pouring down the ladder in a cold waterfall.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point before 1372 DR , a trio of spirit naga made these caverns their home. They lured many creatures to their deaths here, earning the cavern its moniker. During the Silence of Lolth , they managed to coax a stone giant deep into their lair, where they could feast on its trapped corpse.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>A trio of spirit naga laired here circa 1372 DR .</p>
