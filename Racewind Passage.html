<p>The Racewind Passage was the strait in the Sea of Swords that separated the islands of Thelve and Askalet from the Sword Coast mainland, west of the library fortress of Candlekeep .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The narrowest part of the Racewind Passage between the mainland and Thelve was only 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) miles across. This straight crossed with Skoond's Run , the strait that separated the isles of Thelve from the three islands to the south – Arthoum , Nairn's Tomb , and Askalet .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The strait's name came from the harsh northern winds that blew south through the day, only calming at dusk and resting the gales at dawn. As the winds relaxed, thick, cold, and wet fogs rose up from the water and reminded clinging to the area until morning.</p>
