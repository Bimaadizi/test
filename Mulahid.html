<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mulahid fell in love with the Grandmother of the Everlasting â€”a woman said to be so fierce that even lions would get out of her way. Unable to snare her heart by conventional means, Mulahid threatened to kill the Grandmother's followers if she did not submit to his cravings. The Grandmother agreed to spend the night with Mulahid if he released her followers and promised not to harm them. The two met in a remote cave beneath the World Pillar Mountains . The beguiling Grandmother turned Mulahid's lust against him, binding the efreeti with chains of affection. Mulahid promised to serve the Grandmother by ensuring the faithfulness of her followers.</p>
<p>This historical event marked the creation of the first oathbinder genie .</p>
