<p>Shhuusshuru , also known as Shadow Wing was a great wyrm shadow dragon turned dracolich who made her domain in the Far Hills of the Western Heartlands by the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>She was sired sometime before the founding of Cormyr in 26 DR by the shadow dragon Shadraxil , who had many other offspring.</p>
<p>In Year of the Black Dawn, 426 DR , she gave birth to Aurgloroasa (later a leader of the Cult of the Dragon ), who remained in her mother's domain for almost two centuries.</p>
<p>Shhuusshuru preceded her daughter's ascension to dracolichdom with the help of a nascent Cult cell in Berdusk , some time around the early 14 th century DR. Originally, this was just to gain more power in the Western Heartlands but eventually she took over leadership of the cell.</p>
<p>It was at her insistence that the Berduskan cell's second attempt at creating a Sacred One was to involve the red dragon Greshrukk "Red Eye" . This plan involved luring a party of adventurers, who had acquired his stolen phylactery (in the form of a sword pommel), to his cave. They would then ambush them, steal the sword, and perform a ritual that would quickly transfer his essence to his corpse, but this failed.</p>
<p>Shhuusshuru remained active by 1374 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>From her lair in the tallest of the Far Hills, she plotted to take over Darkhold and from there conquer the entire Chionthar river valley.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>She maintained a loose alliance with her daughter Aurgloroasa's cell in Sembia .</p>
