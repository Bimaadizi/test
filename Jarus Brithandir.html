<p>Jarus Brithandir was an unfortunate Cormyrean Purple Dragon knight adventurer in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Jarus was a large muscular human man with long brown hair, adorned in a Purple Dragon knight's armor and armed with a greatsword .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the Year of the Awakened Sleepers, 1484 DR , Jarus Brithandir and his fellow adventurers Helayna , Popkin Shortshanks , Liantor Stoneborn , Kirina Aelorothi , and Tristran of Daggerford found an ancient tomb at the bottom of a crevasse in the Stonelands of Cormyr. They began dungeon-delving the complex and overcame some undead defenders before heading further in through a hidden passageway. They found a long series of caves leading deep underground, overcame more hostile inhabitants, and were eventually ambushed by a team of Clan Daeronnax kobolds that served the great red dragon Daeronnax . The party was split up during the intense fighting, and only Popkin Shortshanks managed to escape the caves entirely. Unable to rescue her friends on her own, she immediately traveled to Eveningstar to find help.</p>
<p>Popkin found a second party of adventurers willing to assist, and sent them on to the tomb to find her friends. The adventurers discovered Jarus Brithandir after a fierce battle in which he slew a band of walking dead and perched himself on a pile of stones to catch his breath. They gave Jarus a trinket enchanted with the word of recall spell that swept him back to the safety of Eveningstar.</p>
