<p>Oil of Second Chances was a unique type of oil , always in high demand, and produced by the Church of Tymora .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Oil of Second Chances was a special brew that could remove curse and grant good luck to the person who used the substance. Apart from the oil's primary use - removing curses , the effect similar to that of the bless spell lasted for thirty-six seconds, while the effects similar to those of the luck spell - for eighteen seconds. Thus, in order to tap into these beneficial magics, the user needed to spend at least six seconds applying to oil.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This magic oil was produced in abundance by the clerics of Tymora . However, it always swiftly sold out, leaving many adventurers who missed out on the latest batch furious. These oils were so effective that even clerics of other faiths kept a reserve for when their divine spells weren't effective enough. Churches that opposed Tymora, like the Church of Beshaba , sought for a way to duplicate the Oil of Second Chances but in a way that bestowed curses instead.</p>
<p>In 1281 DR , Oil of Second Chances was available for purchase from Quinn Silverfinger , a cleric of the Golden Lodge in Lonelywood .</p>
