<p>The Gentle Ghost of Silverymoon was a flying ghostly , sentient apparition which first appeared in Silverymoon around 1459 DR . The identity of the ghost in life was unknown but many wild theories abounded.</p>
<p>The ghost occasionally swooped down and passed through observers who often collapsed but were unharmed other than reporting an intense chill. Those touched by the ghost received a vision of a location, sometimes one within the city walls. A few of the locations were explored by her "victims" and found to contain treasure caches.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Gentle Ghost appeared as an eladrin woman, bluish-white in color. She wore a cloak and robes and was more solid looking from the waist up. She always floated several feet above the ground.</p>
