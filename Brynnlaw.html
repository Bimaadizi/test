<p>Brynnlaw was an island located on the Sea of Swords .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Brynnlaw was once an island town which survived off of fish , as well as other produce. The Spellhold asylum was built nearby, and offered jobs to the denizens. The pirate lord, Desharik , had lost a naval battle against another pirate king. He was forced to this island and his ships invaded the town.</p>
<p>Desharik's pirates took the homes of the people, killed their mayor, and forced them onto the streets. To the town folks' dismay, they dumped their mayor's corpse into the sea. The evicted townspeople begged the asylum for shelter, but the wizard's locked the doors shut. From here on, Desharik took control of the island, forcing many natives into prostitution , or to the grave.</p>
<p>The nearby asylum belonging to the Cowled Wizards was attacked by Jon Irenicus in 1368 DR . Gorion's Ward and his companions traveled on the Galante to Brynnlaw, in order to try and save his fellow Bhaalspawn , Imoen .</p>
