<p>Universal solvent , also known as ultimate solution , was a magical liquid that was similar to a potion or magical substance.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This item appeared to have the properties of both oil of slipperiness and a potion of delusion if examined with magic. What a dose of universal solvent would actually do was to dissolve any adhesive or sticky material that it was applied to. This included cement and magical substances such as sovereign glue , as well as the goo from a tanglefoot bag and the adhesive made by kuo-toa .</p>
<p>A single ounce of universal solvent would work on 1 cubic foot (0.028 cubic meters) of adhesive material. A typical container held 27 fl oz (0.8 L) of fluid. If distilled to one-third of its normal potency, one ounce would cause 1 cubic foot (0.028 cubic meters) of organic and inorganic material to disintegrate .</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Creating it required skill at crafting magical items and the spell disintegrate .</p>
