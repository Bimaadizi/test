<p>Zhudun , also known as the Corpse Star , was a star-like Elder Evil from the Far Realm who had taken a place among stars of Realmspace . Unlike normal stars, Zhudun didn't have a fixed place in the sky but instead danced and wavered across Realmspace.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Zhudun was described as a "corpse star with a blank face".</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Zhudun and the other Far Realm-infested stars of Realmspace were somehow related to the Eldest .</p>
<p>Zhudun was a dead star that somehow still existed in Realmspace.</p>
<p>When the Feywild city of Cendriane fell, Zhudun was the brightest star in the sky.</p>
<p>Zhudun was usually sought out by some warlocks to make a pact with it. Neogi were specially adept to seek out pacts with it and the other Far Realm-infested stars. Zhudun bestowed those warlocks the ability to use the prophecy of Zhudun spell.</p>
<p>Sometime in the late 15 th century DR , a vestige of Zhudun's power had found its way into the domain of Barovia in the Shadowfell , where it offered pacts with creatures who approached it. To those few Zhudun granted its magic, it bestowed the gift to raise the ancient dead, giving them the ability to use the resurrection spell , that always worked regardless of how long a creature had been dead. Even non-warlocks could be granted this ability from the star, though they could use Zhundun's powers just once. Those who were granted the gifts of Zhudun had their appearance changed, turning corpse-like and easily mistaken as undead .</p>
