<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Jaheira was alerted to the mysterious return of Ketheric Thorm , now a leader of a cultist army that worshiped The Absolute . Harper Chenti was one of the agents who accompanied Jaheira into the Shadow-cursed lands surrounding the Moonrise Towers â€”General Thorm's seat of power.</p>
<p>When a group of True Souls arrived at the Last Light Inn , which the Harpers had claimed as a temporary base, Chenti was among those present for the events that followed. When Marcus of the Flaming Fist revealed himself to be a cultist and a turncoat, Chenti lamented that and the fact that she could've never imagined him to betray the Harpers and the Fist. In the end, Chenti concluded that the betrayal was not Marcus's fault but the parasite the Absolute had implanted in his head. It was unknown if Harper Chenti survived the war with the Absolute; she might've perished after the Last Light Inn was consumed by the darkness or else survived with the rest, storming the Moonrise Towers to end General Thorm's reign.</p>
