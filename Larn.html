<p>Larn was a Chauntean priest and winemaker who restored the Morden Winery outside the village of Dragon Falls in the Vast in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When Larn was turned to stone, he was still a young man.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the war against the Grand Army of the Tuigan swept Faerûn in the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , the couple who ran the Morden Winery in the Vast disappeared, presumably by the locals, taken and killed by Tuigans . A year later, a young priest of Earth Mother came across the abandoned winery, restoring it and resuming wine production. During that time, he befriended a duo of ancient fun-loving satyrs , Quellonis and Harmon , who were regular guests of Larn's, tasting new wines, singing songs, and playing music late into the night.</p>
<p>Soon after, the medusa mage named Samanthiss and her consort – maedar Vorlon , found the winery and decided to take over. Larn was petrified by the medusa, while Vorlon assumed the assumed identity of the vintner. The couple continued operating the winery for the following decade. Vorlon showed remorse over Larn's fate but came to love winemaking. Larn's stone body was kept in good condition if the medusas ever needed food.</p>
<p>The winery's rightful owner, Shauna Morden of Ravens Bluff discovered its existence after her father's death circa the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR and hired a group of capable adventurers of the Living City to investigate the winery's condition and establish a dialogue and partnership with its managers if there were any. Subsequently, the Morden Winery was returned to the Morden family, and, by some accounts, the maedar vintner was allowed to run the business; by others, the medusas were slain. Larn was believed to had been released from the decade of being petrified, either with some help from outside forces or as a sign of good will from Vorlon. Were lard given freedom, he was ready to reward his saviors with his enchanted medallion of proof – a precious trinket that changed its appearance depending on its owner's faith or divine patronage.</p>
