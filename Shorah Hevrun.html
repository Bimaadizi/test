<p>Shorah Hevrun was a human girl in Elturel in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Elturel was transported to Avernus , first layer of the Nine Hells , in the Year of Twelve Warnings, 1494 DR , the Hevrun family were killed in the transition, leaving Shorah the only survivor. Four ghasts entered the house to devour the dead while Shorah hid in a cupboard. Adventurers might slay the ghasts and find her, and Shorah would attach herself to whoever was kind to her and follow them to the High Hall —if she was lucky.</p>
