<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nothing of the sword's past was known. However, sometime before Mirtul of the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , it came to be possessed by the Gallaway Trade Depot . The Heart ended up being available for purchase from Deirdre Gallaway in her trading company's store in Targos during the crisis of the Legion of the Chimera , that brought mercenaries from Luskanto aid defenses of the Ten Towns . The leader of the group that would soon become famed heroes of Icewind Dale discovered the sword while perusing Gallaway Trade Depot. The weapon was several dwarf generations old and of distinct dwarven design and make. The blade bore the adventurer's name clearly etched onto it. Despite never encountering the weapon before, they felt a strange familiarity with it. It was not in the best shape, covered in signs of age and battle scars on the metal.</p>
