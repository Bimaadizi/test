<p>The giant Zakharan rat was a large rodent that was known to dwell in Zakhara .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Giant Zakharan rats were cousins of the giant rat but were much larger. Some specimens grew to up to 7 feet (2.1 meters) in length. This was not including their long tail. They were covered in a brownish fur that was filthy and carried communicable diseases.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Giant Zakharan rats were vicious fighters, attacking with their sharp teeth and claws until either their target was killed or the rat itself. Since they lived in packs, a large creature such as a humanoid could be taken down by multiple giant Zakharan rats.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>These large rats were often found in subterranean locations such as dungeons. Their skeletal structure had the ability to be compressed, allowing the giant Zakharan rat to squeeze through cracks and other tight openings. Giant Zakharan rats lived in groups of no larger than a dozen individuals. They ate basically anything they could, both living and dead.</p>
