<p>Bolan was an alchemist and priest of Shar in Yhaunn who presided over the hidden temple of Shar there up until 1373 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bolan was an odd-looking man with short legs, a barrel chest, and a thick neck. His face was oddly motionless and expressionless, his skin alabaster white and free of any stubble, wrinkles or blemishes, and he had a bald pate with a fringe of glossy black hair tied back in a long braid. He stank of the metallic and mineral ingredients he used in his workshop, and his fingers were stained black and yellow.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was domineering and manipulative to those weaker than him, obsequious to those more powerful, and fanatically devoted to Shar above all else. After he noticed Variance's favor towards Keph Thingoleir , he started becoming envious of Keph but never acted against him. He longed to destroy the servants of the Moonmaiden , but never acted openly against them for fear of discovery.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Bolan was a proficient alchemist, able to create lethal substances including alchemist's fire , acid , and poison . He also knew how to create effective medicinal products and other legal goods, but all of the items that he produced had a signature metallic smell that originated from his workshop. He loved to experiment and try new ideas, especially if it meant hurting his enemies.</p>
<p>As a priest of Shar, he had the ability to cast divine spells, but he wasn't very powerful. One of his regular tricks involved creating an illusion in place of a live sacrifice for new initiates to kill, so that his cult did not gather attention from murders.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Publicly, Bolan was an alchemist who operated a shop in a poorer district of Yhaunn. He made and sold a variety of substances, such as medical supplies that he sold to Moonshadow Hall through the priestess Velsinore . He used her to gain information on the internal affairs of the temple, while at the same time she gathered information on the Sharrans from him.</p>
<p>He was also the priest responsible for the temple of Shar in the city, and was the only divinely-empowered priest until the arrival of Variance Amatick . He used his alchemical skills to support the temple's activities with dangerous and illegal substances.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bolan controlled the temple of Shar in Yhaunn up until Kythorn of 1373 DR , when Variance Amatick assumed superiority while impersonating a Calishite priestess from the Temple of Old Night . He never realised that she was a shade from Thultanthar , that she was using his congregation as a disposable tool for her real plan of obtaining The Leaves of One Night , or that she had kidnapped and impersonated the supplicant Jarull Cartcoster and was holding Jarull prisoner in his own temple. He believed that her goal in Yhaunn was to simply destroy Moonshadow Hall and drive the Selûnites out of Yhaunn.</p>
<p>At the behest of Variance, he eagerly participated in the attack on Moonshadow Hall during the new moon of Eleasis , providing support with his alchemical creations. Partway through the battle, he threatened the werewolf Feena Archwood with alchemist's fire laced with powdered silver , but was killed by Julith Harkspur who used a spell to shatter all of the vials and flasks on his person, engulfing him in fire, acid, and poison while he begged Shar for mercy. With his death, the Sharran forces lost their will to fight and were defeated.</p>
