<p>Jesentus Parr was a landowner who claimed ownership of the Parrum's Rock mine in the Neverwinter Wood circa 1374 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Jesentus Parr was a well-to-do man, as was evidenced by the fine quality clothes he wore.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Jesentus recruited a group of heroes during his stay at the Wandering Woodsman's Tavern in Conyberry to clean out undead from a flooded mine called Parrum's Rock, to the west of Conyberry. The mine originally belonged to Jesentus, and he managed it formant years until the mine was inexplicably flooded a short time before 1374 DR. All miners who perished inside rose as drowned ones , making it unable to be cleared and worked again. In addition to the disaster, Jesentus' uncle suddenly passed away earlier in the same year without bequeathing the mine to anyone. Jesentus claimed that his uncle had no other family, and Jesentus's father was estranged from the rest of the family. The township of Conyberry declared that the mine would be given to anyone brave enough to slay the soggy undead creatures and retrieve the deed from its tunnels.</p>
<p>During the monster-slaying delve, the horse uncovered several sets of letters between Jesentus Parr, the mine's foreman, and the foreman's son. It was revealed that the foreman opposed Jesentus's discussion to expand the mine, and under threats of unemployment, the foreman begrudgingly greed to the excavation. As the adventures approached the end of the expedition, they encountered a unique undead creature only known as the "smothered conscience." It was an undead creature wrapped in sagging, wet clothes. It was the undead remnant of the mine's foreman who inadvertently caused the flooding on Jesentus's orders.</p>
<p>When the adventurers confronted the landowner, he refused to accept responsibility and offered to increase the payment in exchange for the deed. It was unrecorded if Jesentus Parr ended up reclaiming the Parrum's Rock, but his guilt for the deaths could not be denied.</p>
