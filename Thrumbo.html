<p>Thrumbo was a strange beggar – a sentient zombie , who shambled across the alleys of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Thrumbo was wrapped in rags, his face hidden under a hood and a scarf. His sickly skin and stench of decay betrayed his undead zombie nature. Unlike other zombies, however, he was fully conscious and possessed undead fortitude and resistance to all types of physical damage.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>In life, Thrumbo was an uneducated beggar and this lack of knowledge accompanied him into the undeath. Whist he was attempting to coordinate an escape from the master, Thrumbo attempted to teach himself to write in common and communicate amongst the fellow beggar zombies through letters.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Thrumbo was created by the mysterious mummy , the Mystic Carrion . Eventually, Thrumbo and several other undead servants escaped their master. In 1492 DR, he could be found hiding away in the Vonayn 's home, a tiny abandoned building overlooking a harbor in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate. The undead creature seemed to have had taken to begging.</p>
<p>Mystic Carrion, however, would not let his creations be and was attempting to find Thrumbo and other sentient zombies through magic or via adventurers . If the adventurers were to confront Thrumbo, he would act terrified of being forced to return to the Mystic Carrion's service, revealing that he and his fellow sentient zombies were once beggars in the Gate who were murdered and raised to be the mummy's slaves. Thrumbo knew of the Mystic Carrion's true nature and could point the adventurers towards where the mummy lord kept his heart in a canopic jar – the key to its destruction. Even though Thrumbo believed that the canopic jars were hidden underneath the Carrion's manse, the mummy lord hid its heart within Thrumbo.</p>
<p>It was unknown if Thrumbo and other undead beggars were slain or returned to the Mystic Carrion's service or if the adventurers elected to help the poor souls, recovering the heart and destroying Mystic Carrion. Another possible outcome was the adventurers attempting to kill the mummy, neglecting to find the heart. This would result in the Mystic Carrion returning shortly after being killed and exacting vengeance on the beggars.</p>
