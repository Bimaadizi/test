<p>Borlin, blood of Ghellin , titled Axe of the Iron House , was a dwarf of the Iron House , the exiled royal court of the Mines of Tethyamar . He was a descendant of Ghellin , King-in-Exile of the Iron House. He was also a leader of dwarven armies, such as the Mithril Legion .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid–14 th century DR , Borlin led a force of dwarves against the green dragon Urnalithorgathla , who laired in the Spiderhaunt Wood in the Dalelands . The victorious dwarves slew the wyrm and Borlin discovered in her hoard the sword Sarghathuld , a legendary blade of the fallen dwarven realm of Roldilar . He claimed the weapon to wield in battle.</p>
<p>Borlin later inspired a large number of dwarven warriors to form the Mithril Legion and embark on a quest to reclaim the lost Mines of Tethyamar, near the Dalelands . They marched out of Tilverton in the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR , heading north-west, but then vanished, their fate unknown.</p>
<p>Some claimed that Borlin and the Mithril Legion had successfully retaken part of the Mines, and sent a report of such to King Ghellin via magic , but this was only speculation.</p>
<p>In fact, Borlin and the Legion made a successful assault against one of gates into Tethyamar, but ran into an orc -fashioned portal . This transported them deep into the mines, far from the entrance. Steadily, they fought their way through the orcs and back to the surface, but fell one by one. Borlin was the last, dying in sight of Tethyamar's doors.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Borlin wielded the sword Sarghathuld , an orcslayer blade of great power.</p>
