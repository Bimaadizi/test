<table border='1'><tr><th>Race</th><td>Windsoul genasi</td></tr></table><br>
<p>Whirlwind genasi were those windsoul genasi who mastered their control over the element of air. They harnessed the powers of wind as powerful as those encountered during storms and hurricanes.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>While the air itself was a part of a whirlwind genasi's heritage, it was also imbued into their soul.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>When a whirlwind genasi walked on the wind , they could actually fly. Similarly, they could form a zephyr that lifted up their allies and flew them as well, if over a short distance.</p>
<p>As they grew in power, these genasi could form a massive cyclone that encircled their body, throwing aside any person caught in its way.</p>
