<p>One room for a night cost 1 gp and included board, stabling, and bottles of evenfeast wine . Muffins and chilled juice were provided in the sitting room and every suite included a bathtub with running water, maid services, and news criers who came to each room. These reporters were pleasant youths who would recount local and more widespread information about the lands every hour.</p>
