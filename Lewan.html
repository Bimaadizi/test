<p>Lewan was Berun 's apprentice. An orphan from Murghom and a follower of Silvanus .</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>Lewan's skin was weathered by exposure to the elements and darker than Alaodin 's but not as rich as Talieth 's. He was tall and lean, but also strong. Per Valmir , he resembled a Murghomi or Mulhorandi .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lewan was originally the child of farmers from Murghom. He was saved by Berun and Chereth after raiders from the Ganathwood slew his family on 1369 DR . The raid put him in a position where he mercy-killed his mother, which traumatized him intensely.</p>
<p>He remained with Berun until the age of seventeen, in 1374 DR, when the two of them were captured by assassins from Sentinelspire while pursuing a tiger that had killed a shepherd. While attempting to escape, they were separated when a shambling mound swallowed up Berun. Lewan fell unconscious from multiple injuries, and was taken to Sentinelspire for treatment. He was treated as a guest of Lady Talieth there, even granted an opportunity to leave. Talieth sought his aid in unlocking the powers of Erael'len , an artifact that one of her hunters had taken from Berun, which the Old Man of the Mountain intended to use to destroy civilization throughout Faerûn . Lewan remained unswayed, until he bonded with the servant Ulaan .</p>
<p>However, after numerous days of attempting, he suspected that having lain with Ulaan on the night of the Jalesh Rudra may have rendered him unclean in the eyes of Silvanus. Though he apologized to Ulaan for the implications, he requested Lady Talieth that he be allowed to try and purify himself outside the fortress, and that Ulaan be freed from service once he succeeded. The requests were granted (with great skepticism, particularly regarding Ulaan), though the hunter Sauk was sent to accompany him. While attempting a rite of purification, he was approached by the Old Man of the Mountain. That night, he had a dream that Sentinelspire exploded in a supervolcanic eruption, decimating civilization throughout Faerûn. Before he could try again to unlock the power of Erael'len , the fortress came under attack by Berun.</p>
<p>Lewan made an attempt to escape in the conmotion; he got into a fight with several Blades of the Old Man. In the process, Ulaan revealed was one of the Blades of Lady Talieth; the apprentice revealed, in turn, that he had figured this out on his own. Nonetheless, he was brought to the Tower of the Sun by the killoren serving the Old Man. There he learned that the Old Man of the Mountain he had spoken to while purifying himself was Chereth, Berun's master. Chereth was frustrated that neither Lewan nor Berun would abide by his plans to destroy the world using the power of the fortress and Erael'len , and almost killed Ulaan to punish Lewan for this. Though the two of them managed to get away while others fought Chereth, it was Lewan who dealt the final blow to the druid.</p>
