<p>Ghaliyah bint Borga , also known as Gala of the Marketplace , was a dwarf and the Chief Wadi of Gana in the Pearl Cities region of west Zakhara in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Ghaliyah had held her position for three years as of 1367 DR. Like all hakima , she could always see the truth of a matter though sometimes choose to keep it hidden. This behavior arose from Sultan Yusef al-Wadi 's history of blaming any scandals of note, regardless of the truth, on the current Chief Wadi and then banishing them.</p>
