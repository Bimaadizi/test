<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1358 DR , a barbarian army from Kara-Tur was threatening the lands of Chondath and Turmish . In the days leading up to the impending battle, the Turmish mercenary Dak Zarre , along with important members of his mercenary company, the Blood Hawks , took up residence in the Blue Roan. One day Zarre came across a group of adventurers and, believing them to be seasoned warriors more fit for commanding an army than Commander Pohidge Plam , invited them to stay with him and his men in the Blue Roan.</p>
