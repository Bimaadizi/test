<p>Hoarbridge was a waymeet and end destination of the Cold Road .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The site lay in northern Narfell where the route from distant Nethentir ended on the frozen shores of the upper Icelace Lake . It lay some 200 miles (320 kilometers) north of N'Jast .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Hoarbridge owed its location and early importance to the dwarven kingdom of Dareth , as the metal wealth of the dwarves attracted many men.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Chilled Marrow, −343 DR , Dareth stopped trading in the waymeet of Hoarbridge, for reasons unknown to the Nar who simply recorded that the "Stout Folk came no more." In reality, a flight of white dragons had claimed the upper caverns of the dwarven kingdom, and the dwarves themselves been driven deep below. In time, dwarf and dragon slew each other, thus opening up the way for hunters and woodsmen.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Far Quey tribe lived north of Hoarbridge on the other side of the Icelace Lake, and the Hoarbridge waymeet was the nearest trading place that the tribe could reach.</p>
