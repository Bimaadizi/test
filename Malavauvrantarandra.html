<p>Malavauvrantarandra , or Malavauvra for short, was an ancient steel dragon who lived on the continent of Arandron on Toril .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Malavauvra was aged and unwell and weak, a condition that made her vulnerable.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>Malavauvra's mate was Phaudrantanthildrar (Phaudron), a withdrawn and focused scholar researching draconic longevity. Malavauvra had laid a number of clutches of eggs in her lifetime, but her last was in poor shape: most of her young were sickly and died as hatchlings or within their first year. Only Velsaertirden , Rauvrahrileenatandrar , and Torthalindrarron survived.</p>
<h2>Lair</h2>
<p>The family laired within the castle of Steelspires , which had been built for them by stone giants . It stood on a high, bare rocky ridge behind the bustling port city of Haunvaerune .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When her children grew to become "dragonets", capable of taking human form and switching forms with ease, Malavauvra encouraged them to explore the neighboring human city of Haunvaerune.</p>
<p>Some time around the 8 th century DR , Malavauvra was murdered in her sleep by her own daughter, Rauvrahreene, using magic stolen from her father, after killing him the same way. She then seized control of Steelspires, turning it against her brothers.</p>
