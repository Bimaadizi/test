<p>Orten Imdrar was the Magister from 1306 DR to 1317 DR .</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>A middle-aged man, he was burly and had a paunch. His white hair was always untidy, and his face wasn't much prettier.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He could cast fly , some form of scrying , and cone of cold . He also knew a spell or had a method for blasting open caverns.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before becoming the Magister, Orten Imdrar was a trail-mage who employed utility spells along trips to protect cargo. At the moment of gaining the office of the Magister , he had been doing a stint working magic in mining, where he accidentally slew Aralagath Tarsil by blowing up a cavern beneath the ground where he was sleeping.</p>
<p>Though he feared the mantle of the Magister had passed on to him only so that he could be sacrificed, Orten Imdrar eventually decided to travel and see the world, visiting Waterdeep , Selgaunt , Calimport , and some other locations. To spread magic, he scried on mages to find good magic, and then scried on apprentices, most often attractive young women, to decide where to best give it.</p>
<p>His career ended at the Border Kingdoms , in High Emmerock ; he thought to challenge Scsilda Starshield , the Water Witch , and take the sapphires she kept, as well as her home. Elminster , forbidden to attack him, but dedicated to protecting Scsilda, placed a shield around her that would tear anyone apart if they crossed it; he then teleported a fledgling mage, Qilder Yarven , who was nonetheless carrying seven wands , into the path of Orten Imdrar's incoming cone of cold . Qilder retaliated, and Orten was sent into Elminster's shield; heavily damaged, he was finally slain by Qilder Yarven.</p>
