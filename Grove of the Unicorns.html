<p>The Grove of the Unicorns was the divine realm of the Faer√ªnian goddess Mielikki .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It appeared to be only a simple grove of trees found within a larger forest, but it was much bigger on the inside than on the outside. If an explorer could be counted as a friend to nature, they might spot a unicorn drinking from a pool in the heart of the grove, whereupon the entirety of the lush realm would appear around them. But one who was unworthy would not see the unicorn and could wander in and out and never know the realm was there.</p>
<p>According to the animal petitioners, there were odd settlements hidden within the Grove, but there were a mystery to outsiders.</p>
