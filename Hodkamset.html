<p>Hodkamset was the most powerful wizard in the service of Set in Mulhorand in 1357 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Once Hodkamset was Sesostris , a wizard in service of Osiris but he had many enemies, especially among the clerics of Horus-Re , who managed to ruin Sesostris's reputation. So Sesostris faked his death, changed his face and name, and devoted himself to Set. He became the right hand of Seti , the current incarnation of Set.</p>
<p>Hodkamset created a replica of the Alabaster Staff known as the Staff of the necromancer in order to secure his reputation.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Hodkamset was a member of the Fangs of Set . He had many spies across Mulhorand, many contacts inside Sampranasz , and an alliance with Zhentil Keep . His plans were to replace the young Pharaoh Horustep III with a rakshasa follower of Set in order to create chaos inside the clergy of Horus-Re, hoping to use this to gave the throne to Seti.</p>
<p>Hodkamset also sent a team to search for powerful lost artifacts around the Realms in order to use them in a future war to conquer the nation. He always traveled in disguise.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Hodkamset was very ambitious and a bit of a megalomaniac: he believed he truly was the one who could bring the rule of Set to Mulhorand. He was also very devious.</p>
