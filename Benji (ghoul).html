<p>Benji was the Principal Sniffer, a ghoul , kept by Lucretious , the proprietress of of the Circus of the Last Days in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Benji appeared to be an ordinary blood-splattered leather-skinned undead ghoul with limited intelligence and a docile nature, thanks to being controlled by the Circus of the Last Days. The ghoul was dressed in a colorful jester -like garb.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Benji could be found at the gate of Lucretious's circus in Rivington of Baldur's Gate , where the extra-planar troupe performed for a short period of time, before moving on to another world. In lieu of recently surging murders in Baldur's Gate, Benji was tasked with sniffing out blood on every guest entering the circus. The ghoul was supervised by Klaus , the Assistant Sniffer. One of the sniffees was the commoner man named Montgomery , who brought his son to see the famed Dribbles the clown. Even though the father and the son both were clean, the boy was terrified of the blood-covered jester ghoul and refused to enter the circus.</p>
