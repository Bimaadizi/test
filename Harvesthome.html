<p>Harvesthome was an abbey inside the walled temple-complex of Goldenfields . Like the complex itself, the abbey was dedicated to the worship of the goddess of agriculture, Chauntea . It was considered one of the largest and most elaborate buildings in the complex.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>It was a large edifice of gray stone, with dozens of statues of Chauntea raising her hands to the sky. Well-maintained hedges surrounded the building. Set above the entrance was a stained glass window shaped like the sun.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Inside the abbey there was a number of pillared arcades. Narrow stained-glass windows provided light to these arcades and each was decorated in images of wheat, fruit, and vegetables. In the rear of the building was a large bronze bell, mounted between sturdy roof beams.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The large bronze bell towards the back of the building was rung each day approximately fifteen minutes before the morning, noon, and evening prayer. It was typically rung nine times in the morning, three times in the afternoon, and six times in the evening.</p>
<p>Each day most workers took a break from their chores to listen to the abbot's words, though such a task was not mandatory.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time after 1485 DR , two black bears wandered into the southern fields of the compound and were taken in by some of Goldenfields's workers. The two bears were provided food and shelter and eventually followed the workers to inside the abbey itself.</p>
