<p>Gravemaster's blinder was an enchanted helmet to be used by a lich , designed sometime before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The helmet was a mask that had no openings for the wearer's eyes, making it a blinding piece of equipment. However, it was creted to be used by powerful liches who did not need to relay on physical sight as senses were easily fooled. Gravemaster's blinder boosted the wearer's life essence, aim, defense, deflection of attacks, and increased their magical abilities to steal opponents' lives. Additionally, every time the wearer slew a creature, Gravemaster's blinder had a chance of summoning a wraith under the wearer's control.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, the Red Wizards of Thay dispatched agents to the Jungles of Chult as the dangerous death curse began spreading across Faer√ªn . Gravemaster's blinder was one of the rare pieces of enchanted gear brought to Chult by Szass Tam 's mages and his undead servants.</p>
