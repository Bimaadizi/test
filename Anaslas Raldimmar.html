<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>Anaslas was sharp-featured and handsome.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>

<h2>Activities</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>After tricking his teacher, Arghorst Talandor , into spending most of his spells, Anaslas challenged the Magister to a duel, gaining the mantle of the Magister in the process. He spent most of his tenure obsessed with hunting warriors in the shape of a giant bird, until he was ambushed and slain by Eleedra Nathchant in 407 DR .</p>
