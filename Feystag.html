<p>Feystags , also known as calygraunts , were rare fey creatures that could control magic items .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Calygraunts were small creatures, only about 4 feet (1.2 meters) tall at the shoulder, and were said to be similar in build to a cat, but with stag-like antlers and dusty brown fur. They normally walked on all fours, but were capable of standing erect, and their clawed forelimbs only allowed for crude use of tools.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Calygraunts delighted in hoarding and mastering magical items.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Calygraunts could innately sense the magic in magical items within 60 ft (18 m) of them, seeing it as auras of varying brightness, and could normally determine the type, specific functions, and even the strength (number of uses, charges, etc., left) of an item 90% of the time, at least when not confused, feebleminded, or under psionic attack, and near 100% of the time if they had seen it in use.</p>
<p>Once they had identified an item, they could activate and control those items that were triggered by force of will, silent mental command, or spoken word, from up to 20 ft (6.1 m) away.</p>
<p>Calygraunts were immune to enchantment and divination magic, as well as psionics that had mind-reading or influencing effects.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Feystags were solitary creatures, although there were reports of encounters with the occasional mated pair as well. They were very rare and elusive, dwelling only in deep and remote forests. They were territorial and always scouted their entire territory, and consequently knew where every spring, cavern, hiding place, and other location of note was, including every good place for a trap; calygraunt lairs were normally surrounded by many traps. Feystags delighted in mastering and hoarding magical items.</p>
<p>Calygraunts were naturally omnivorous, but preferred to feed on certain mosses , mistletoe , and mint . Known predators were basically anything that also preyed upon deer. Calygraunts got along well with centaurs , korreds , and satyrs .</p>
<p>Crazed and rabid feystags were known for jumping around wildly.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Esk , the first king of Alphalon , was a calygraunt.</p>
