<p>Ragarra was a Zakharan goddess who represented the jungle and its violent nature. She wanted to destroy any civilization that wanted to tame the wilderness around it and was therefore considered a savage goddess , i.e. , a deity opposed to the culture of Enlightenment predominant in the Land of Fate.</p>
<p>Ragarra's symbols included a cyclone, a green three-fingered claw and a baby crocodile biting its own tail. The deity, sometimes also called Raggara, was depicted as a crocodile-headed female with the wings of a bat. Her mate was Shajar , god of the Nogaro River . She filled a similar role in the Land of Fate as the god Malar did in Faer√ªn .</p>
<p>Her cult was driven underground long ago because of its anarchical nature, but became stronger in the years preceding 1367 DR , cowing parts of the local population with acts of violence. Most of her worshipers resided in or around the cities of Dihliz , Rog'osto , and Kadarasto , where they had secret lairs. Small shrines decorated the entrance of Dihliz's canal system. These were erected with the hopes of appeasing the goddess and her ferocious crocodiles . One of Rog'osto's famous towers housed a larger shrine to the goddess.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before its decline the empire of Kadar outlawed worship of Ragarra and destroyed all temples associated with the goddess, littering the jungle with ruins.</p>
