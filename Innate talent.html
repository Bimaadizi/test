<p>Innate talents were unique abilities that awakened at first contact with magic .</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Anyone who was touched by magic for the first time had a small, 1 in a 100, chance of developing one such innate talent; that chance was doubled for those who were the sole recipients of that magic. Those who were the progeny of two people with innate talents of their own had a 1 in 25 chance of possessing such a power, with a 1 in 100 chance that their magic would manifest at the time of their birth; otherwise, it would awaken later in life at their first contact with magic at the normal rate. Such powers also awakened from being in intensely magical places, such as Thar .</p>
<h2>Possible Powers</h2>
<p>These innate talents varied in frequency and reliability, and many were deleterious to use. Many of them were much like known spells such as clairaudience , detect good or evil , detect snares and pits , detect thoughts , ironguard , levitate , stone tell , telekinesis , temporal stasis , time stop , tree shape , or water walk . Other talents did not resemble known spells, being instead a perfect awareness of true north or the ability to deflect all spells or mental attacks, to see infrared, to locate water, to gain visions of objects handled, or to sometimes predict another creature's actions perfectly. Other abilities were akin to those granted by the great elixir . In rare cases, two talents coexisted, and every day one of them would be manifest. Talents were also known to change sometimes, or even fade away entirely after a few years. Other known powers were a perfect imitation of others' speech, down to the user's ability to mimic the target's vocabulary beyond what they'd ever heard them speak, and other audible mannerisms.</p>
<p>According to Volothamp Geddarm in Volo's Guide to All Things Magical edited by Elminster , people who displayed such powers were always incapable of learning magic .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Knowledge of innate talents was not shared freely by wizards, who were mostly not interested in testing the idle curious for powers developed upon contact with magic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Such powers had been known since ancient times. During the late 14 th century DR , the sage Eltrivyn of Candlekeep was studying such folk and offered them sanctuary in exchange for an opportunity to study them.</p>
<h2>Rumors and Legends</h2>
<p>Tales about such powers often were about people who struck back at overbearing wizards with newfound powers in moments of great oppression. Many who developed such powers feared they may have been cursed, and were in turn feared as possible " fiendkin ".</p>
