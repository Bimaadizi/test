<p>Garrulos the Occasionally Good was an adventurer and bloodforge mage in the Utter East during the time of the Bloodforge Wars ( 648 â€“ 657 DR ). Notably, he found the Pearl of Power and fought to protect the city of Konigheim from his brother Wormskull and the results of his own actions.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Garrulos was a tall, muscular man with brown hair and a heroic chin.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He purported himself to be a noble crusader who tried to preserve the Pearl of Power against corruption. However, as his epithet suggest, this was at best a "sometimes" thing.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Garrulos was the brother of Wormskull, a mad inventor. The two couldn't've been more unalike, in temperament, skills, size, and looks. About the only thing they had in common was the chin. Needless to say, they feuded a bit.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Garrulos and Wormskull were a pair of treasure-hunting brothers who delved into an ancient barrow tomb, heedless of a curse said to bring grief and misfortune. They uncovered an artifact known as the Pearl of Power ; legend held that it could make arcane inventions come alive, but that it had a curse that greed would give rise to war and disaster. However, Garrulos immediately snatched it for himself, cheating his own brother of the glory. "For safekeeping", he claimed, Garrulos took it to Konigheim to present it to the king. This act triggered the Nuts and !Bolts ( sic ) conflict between the brothers.</p>
