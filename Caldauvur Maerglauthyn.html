<p>Caldauvur Maerglauthyn was the Magister from 946 DR to 949 DR . He was a weredragon .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Caldauvur was both handsome and strong.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Little was recorded of Caldauvur before his tenure as the Magister; he was known to have seized a dying dragon 's hoard at some point, and used it to pay for his tuition at a magic school somewhere south of Westgate . He then moved to the northern side of the Sword Coast .</p>
<p>He became the Magister in autumn of the Year of the Blazing Call, 946 DR , during nuptials with the previous Magister, Taline Telgara , where one of her magical wards forced him back into dragonshape, as he was a weredragon. She did not survive; his first act as the Magister was to offer his life to Mystra in order to restore Taline to life. Azuth appeared to reject his offer, asking him to be as good a Magister as she was. Though he fled to the North, and failed to defend himself thereafter, either Mystra or Azuth defended him from challengers amongst both would-be Magisters and other dragons.</p>
<p>Caldauvur returned from his hermitage in spring. He began to give classes, accepting everyone, but making his instruction both formal and harsh; he enforced ironclad discipline with spells, and taught the ethics involved in spell-hurling alongside every spell. Though both mages and rulers came to fear the Schooled , as his disciples came to be known, they still respected his goals grudgingly.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Forbidden Tome, 949 DR , a number of malevolent mages conspired to stop him, and took the shapes and places of a community of the Schooled in a walled manor in the lower Dessarin Valley . They attacked him en masse there; though they slew him, he slew all but two of them. One was left screaming, staring, and witless, while the other survivor became the next Magister, Ildathchance Orlaer .</p>
