<p>Iirikos Stoneshoulder (also seen as Iirkos ) was a famed master dwarf artisan of the Stoneshoulder clan from the dwarven kingdom of Ammarindar in the Northdark around the 2 nd century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Dwarf, 149 DR , Iirikos Stoneshoulder and a team of dwarves from Ammarindar built a spectacular and beautiful arching stone bridge across the River Delimbiyr for some elven friends who lived in the area, at the place that would later be the settlement of Loudwater . Later referred to as Flying Fish Bridge , it was considered to be constructed by the dwarves to honor the elves.</p>
<p>Presumably, the dwarf artisan also built a manor house for a local elf lord, and the settlement of Loudwater developed around it.</p>
<p>According to local theories and the Hegredathas , a written history of the Delimbiyr Vale , Iirikos also constructed the Granite Tower standing in the village of Shining Falls . Proponents of the theory pointed to the similar stonework as proof. The Hegredathas related the story that Iirikos was commissioned by Silifrey the Spraystrider , an Illuskan wizard rumored to practice dark magic. Ignoring the warnings and pleas of his elven friends, who were left bewildered by his choice, Iirikos built the Granite Tower swiftly using summoned elementals . But he also installed magical wards that would activate and destroy any who worked evil magic within its walls. Silifrey was slain before a month had passed.</p>
<p>In addition, it was widely rumored that Iirikos built a great subterranean dwarven complex, which was accessed via caves behind Shining Falls . There was such a complexâ€”the Royal Caverns of Splendarrmornn , the capital city of Ammarindar. The Royal Caverns were a legendary tomb of dwarf royalty,</p>
