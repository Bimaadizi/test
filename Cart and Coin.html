<p>The Cart and Coin was a caravan outfitter located in the crossroad town of Triboar in the Dessarin Valley in the mid-to-late 14 th century and late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It lay in the north of the town, between the west caravan campground and the Talking Troll .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Along with caravan gear and supplies and animal feed, the store sold and exchanged horses and draft animals; and hired out caravan guards to caravans. Their guards were selected from a roster of ticketed mercenaries who'd come to Triboar looking for work. They were interviewed while being examined by a wizard using ESP to determine their trustworthiness, then granted a certification ticket and lodged in a barracks on site to wait for a client and their place in a job roster. However, these tickets were often sold, swapped, shared, or stolen, so they were not a guarantee.</p>
<p>In the late 1400s DR, the Cart and Coin also offered horseshoeing services.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In the late 1400s DR, the store was run by married owners Arn and Syreen Widdens with their four young children. They had a half-dozen employees who fed, watered, and exercised animals, mucked out stables, and attached and removed horseshoes .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The business was in operation by the mid-1360s DR.</p>
<p>It was still in business after 1485 DR .</p>
