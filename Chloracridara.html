<p>Chloracridara was an old female green dragon who lived in the partially standing temple to Corellon Larethian in the ruined Eaerlanni settlement of Mhiilamniir . She had lived there for more than six hundred years by 1372 DR .</p>
<p>Rabidly paranoid, Chloracridara claimed the whole city and its environs as her domain, making it too hazardous for elven pilgrims to visit any of the temples.</p>
