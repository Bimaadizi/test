<p>House Aelorothi was a gold elf noble house with holdings on Evermeet by the 14 th century DR . They were once a minor house of the realm of Siluvanede (c. −8400 DR to 882 DR ).</p>
<h2>Livery</h2>
<p>The colors of the house were red and blue, while its crest depicted a red swan on a blue field.</p>
<h2>Home</h2>
<p>By 1367 DR , the family home was located in the northern part of the city of Leuthilspar on Evermeet. It was a tower, tall and slender, pale blue in color with green veins.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Traditionally, the Aelorothi elves served as priests and warrior-clerics to the elven gods of the Seldarine , especially Corellon Larethian . Their numbers were much diminished by 1367 DR, but they still cared for Evermeet's temples and blessed elf fighters and sailors.</p>
<p>Despite this holy calling, the Aelorothi of ancient Siluvanede were among those minor houses corrupted by House Dlardrageth from around −4800 DR . They joined in their elf– demon crossbreeding and spawned a bloodline of fey'ri , and were complicit in the realm's warmongering, before being held captive for millennia. After their liberation in 1369 DR , the Aelorothi fey'ri became a subclan of House Dlardrageth and joined the daemonfey army of Sarya Dlardrageth .</p>
<p>Coincidentally, many of Aelorothi—gold elf or fey'ri—were noted spies.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The family on Evermeet owned a number of precious magical items suited for clerics , such as two rods of resurrection and the storied staff of Rumathil .</p>
