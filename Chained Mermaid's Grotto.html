<p>The Chained Mermaid's Grotto was an inn and tavern found in Yhaunn in 1358 DR .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Grotto was not the worst set of accommodations in Yhaunn, narrowly beating out Reldegar's Roost and its company. It was an old repurposed warehouse that was damp in summer and freezing cold in winter, and managed to cost as much as a much finer inn.</p>
