<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Spur, 1348 DR , an ambitious wizard from Zhentil Keep named Horaundoon developed a type of magic that allowed him to tap into spell mantles and drain their knowledge and spells , incinerating the target in the process. Horaundoon targeted elves due to his hate of the Fair Folk. Arlathna was among the victims. Elminster Aumar and Dove Falconhand were acquainted with the elven mage and were ordered by the Lady of Mystery to helm the investigation of her strange death. Elminster theorized that a strange possessing spirit or a Zhent wraith was to blame.</p>
