<p>Bwimb II , called the Paraelemental Princess of Ooze , was the second evil archomental of the Paraelemental Plane of Ooze after the death of her father, Bwimb . Although she was generally considered a true archomental (in the loosest sense), she was the weakest of the group.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bwimb II was an undulating mass of violet sludge.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>According to rumor, Bwimb II knew that she would never be more than a minor archomental on her own and had begun searching outside of her homeplane for allies.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h3>Enemies</h3>
<p>Like her father, Bwimb II was an enemy of Ben-hadar because of how she polluted pure waters.</p>
<h3>Allies</h3>
<p>Bwimb II had somehow come to an understanding with the demon lord Juiblex , though what their shared goals might be was unclear.</p>
<h3>Servitors</h3>
<p>The ooze para-elementals obeyed her, but little else that inhabited the Para-Elemental Plane of Ooze paid any attention to her.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bwimb II inherited her power and title as archomental of Ooze after the death of her father, Bwimb, at the hands of Tenebrous .</p>
<p>In the 15 th century DR , several archomental-worshiping cults became active in Faer√ªn . Such cults were ultimately responsible for the Elemental Evil crisis.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>According to some rather morbid gossip, Bwimb II had spawned from the sludge-like corpse of her "father".</p>
