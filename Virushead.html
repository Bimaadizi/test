<p>The Virushead was a deadly plaguechanged creature that was held captive in Airspur , Akanûl , in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Each day, the Virushead unleashed hundreds of different deadly diseases from its rotting skin and phlegmy exhalations.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Virushead was born as a consequence of the Spellplague of the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR . It was later captured by the genasi at great cost in the wilds of Akanûl during the rule of Queen Cyndra , and encapsulated in magical stasis in a hidden earthmote in the city of Airspur. The genasi began to investigate the creature in order to use it as a weapon against the Abolethic Sovereignty , but as it was considered too dangerous it was decided to be held in stasis until there was a great necessity to use it.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the Steward of the Sky Lehaya was in charge of the research on the Virushead, and she tasked a group of wizards to learn how to focus the diseases created by it to target specific creatures while leaving genasi unscathed. However, the Steward of Fire, Magnol , opposed her, believing the Virushead was too dangerous to be released. Mostly due to Magnol's protests, Queen Arathane outlawed any experimentation on the Virushead, forcing Lehaya to resort to study it clandestinely.</p>
