<p>Yuan-ti grafts were serpentine body parts attached (" grafted ") to the body of another corporeal creature or person.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These grafts were most often applied by yuan-ti to their humanoid cultists and servants in order to enhance their usefulness. They were not magical , and creatures who received yuan-ti grafts were considered a form of serpentfolk .</p>
<p>Some yuan-ti would also seek grafts for themselves, viewing them as ways to immediately better themselves and improve their social standing among their peers. Some yuan-ti considered the added power that came with grafting to be a way of honoring their god Sseth , and thus disdained those "lazy" yuan-ti who forewent such grafts. In some cases, Sseth was said to bestow grafts directly onto his followers in exchange for a blood sacrifice.</p>
<p>Yuan-ti grafts could not be reattached if removed from the recipient creature.</p>
<h3>Creation</h3>
<p>The knowledge of how to attach these grafts was known only to the yuan-ti themselves, and some experimented with grafting flesh onto their captives. The process required familiarity with healing as well as specialized knowledge of the magic for grafting flesh to another creature. Yuan-ti anathema could create grafts more quickly than others.</p>
<h2>Users</h2>
<p>Among yuan-ti seeking to raise their profiles, yuan-ti purebloods were the most likely to pursue grafts, although they preferred augmentations that could be concealed so as to maintain their outwardly human disguises. Yuan-ti anathemas were the most common bestowers of yuan-ti grafting given that the magic came easily to them, while other yuan-ti who worked closely with humanoid agents were the next most likely to learn how to graft. Grafting techniques were practiced by senior members of House Extaminos , and many members were known to augment themselves with grafted "serpent arms" which they kept coiled around themselves beneath their clothing, thus giving an impression of great girth.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , a yuan-ti anathema known as Phelriss grafted arms onto the dark naga progeny of Calliope , but allowed rumors to spread that they had hatched with these arms.</p>
