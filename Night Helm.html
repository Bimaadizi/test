<p>The Night Helm is a magical helmet supposedly created centuries ago by Elminster himself for the King of Cormyr . The helm protects the wearer from any mind affecting spell and from scrying . The helm was kept in the Kings Tower in Marsember to be used by an Obarskyr on the run. In 1479 DR the helm was stolen by the Death knight Targrael in an effort to shield her from Manshoon's scrying.</p>
