<p>Earthcarver was a powerful purple worm -slaying greatsword of the Underdark in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Earthcarver's magic was purposed to slay purple worms (and the creatures that lived in their bellies), and provided exceptional protection against acids . It also blazed with a bright light that burned and seared the foe, sometimes leaving nothing behind at all.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The great blade was held by the drow arena master Feryl Cay'Vorym during the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar . He operated the Cay'Vorym Fighting Pit , and took pride in his deadly talents and deadlier blade. When Sorina Parnock sent a force from Eveningstar to rescue captured Purple Dragons , the commotion of battle in the arena drew up hungry purple worms that wrecked the arena and devoured the spectators. Finally, the massive Sineater broke in and swallowed Feryl, shattering Earthcarver in the process. The Cormyreans were swallowed shortly after, and fought through the worm guts while picking up the still-powerful shards of the blade—using them against the local fauna and recharing its energies in the process. They finally found Feryl deep in the worm and slew him, taking his last piece of Earthcarver and fully reassembling the blade. They then used it to cut their way out of Sineater and escape, mortally wounding the beast before finally finishing it off.</p>
