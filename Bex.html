<p>Bex was a tiefling from Elturel who along with her partner Danis and others of their kind, were exiled from the city to live as refugees in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Despite the dire circumstances under which she lived, Bex was an eternal optimist. Even when forced from her home to live in caves, Bex maintained her spirits by fantasizing with Danis about the new life they would build together.</p>
<p>She loved dancing and baking, especially cakes made with almond.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Like other tieflings, Bex was forced from Elturel in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , following the catastrophe known as the Descent , during which the city was briefly pulled down into the Nine Hells . Bex and Danis remained in good spirits as the Elturian tieflings took shelter at the Emerald Grove , joyful and optimistic about the new life they would have in Baldur's Gate . They planned to open an eatery in the Outer City and get a small orange cat , possibly named Geoffrey.</p>
