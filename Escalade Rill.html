<p>Escalade Rill was a river of east Netheril that fed the Alley .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Escalade Rill was described to be an exceptionally dangerous river, mainly due to its turbulent and fast-moving flow. This, combined with its rapids and small-scale waterfalls, made Escalade Rill one of the most deadly waterways over the whole of Faerûn . Nobody survived crossing it, not even the bravest of adventurers or the most skilled trappers and explorers.</p>
<p>Though not possible to traverse on foot, it was sometimes possible for boats to be able to navigate through this river. However, this usually resulted in the waterborne crafts spinning off-course or even being destroyed by the tempestuous flows and irregularly-shaped rocks. In order to navigate through Escalade Rill, one had to perform extremely rigorous checks. Waterborne craft proficiency checks had to be made once per mile (62 times), until the river reached the Alley.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Located in the eastern Netheril region, the river formed just north of the Abbey Mountains . It then flowed westwards until it fed the Alley, a longer river that ended in the Narrow Sea .</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Some daring seafarers would use skimmers to try and gain control of their boats in the hazardous river as part of a dangerous game. However, despite their courage, these seamen would only be rewarded with a permanent "early retirement".</p>
