<p>The Djen was a large group of djinn and their slaves and servants led by the powerful djinni Calim . They came to Faerûn from the Elemental Plane of Air around −7800 DR and settled the areas immediately surrounding present-day Calimport . This event was known as "The Great Arrival " and within mere months, they had built a large city, whose spires quickly rose above the trees.</p>
<p>They then proceeded to clear and seize all of the lands south and west of the Marching Mountains but unfortunately, after only 10 years, their city fell to a flight of dragons. Although with the genie's magic, the city was rebuilt within a year, the attack caused Calim to lead the Djen in a campaign against the dragons of the Marching Mountains. Within 100 years, all of the dragons in that mountain range were dead.</p>
<p>The Djen empire lasted nearly two millennia with Calim at its head but its existence was fraught with war, first with marids , then with efreet led by Memnon . The battles with the efreet were particularly destructive.</p>
<p>Eventually, tired of the senseless destruction, Elven High mages disembodied Calim and Memnon, causing the creation of the Calim Desert . Afterward The human and halfling slaves and servants allied with the dwarves of Shanatar to drive the rest of the genies out of the area, creating the nation of Coramshan .</p>
<p>It was the legacy of the Djen that so many genasi were to be found in the nation of Calimshan by the late 14 th century DR .</p>
