<p>Pixel glasses were specialized sets of glasses designed to see through the effects of the pixelating curse .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Pixel glasses were a magical pair of eyeglasses made from dark glass. The lenses were in the shape of squares.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A pair of the glasses allowed their user to see through the pixelation of a creature or object affected by the curse. At the same time, they made it equally difficult to identify non-pixelated creatures. However, the glasses were also cursed to make their wearer more susceptible to the pixelating curse. The eyes of a creature pixelated while wearing the glasses became solid-colored and cube-shaped. While wearing the glasses, the affected creature was compelled to hide this transformation.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Multiple pairs of pixel glasses were created by the derro architect Avnas . At the time of the pixelating curse, multiple pairs could be found around Cube 1717 .</p>
