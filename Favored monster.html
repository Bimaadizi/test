<p>A favored monster was a kind of monster that was favored by a deity .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deities could show their powers through major manifestations and minor manifestations. The appearance of a monster fell into the latter category.</p>
<p>Unlike other minor manifestations, these manifestations were not sent to inform mortals of something but as a means for direct aid. This aid could be to attack or protect against enemies. For example, Vhaeraunite drow were sometimes accompanied by air and earth mephits , shadows , yeth hounds , and shadow dragons , who were servants of Vhaeraun .</p>
<p>Outsider servants were sent with a specific mission for a specific time frame.</p>
<h2>Mortals' Reaction</h2>
<p>Mortals could react in a fearful manner to a favored monster. Deities generally tried to accommodate these fears by sending monsters who were familiar to them or a favored animal instead.</p>
<p>Clerics could summon these monsters by using planar ally or summon monster spells .</p>
