<p>Herne the Huntmaster , or Herne Hurkgruum in Orcish , also known as the Wild Hunter , was a deity of hunting worshiped by the orcs of the High Forest , instead of the orc pantheon . He was also the herald of Cerunnos when that god needed to intervene in mortal affairs, in which capacity he was known as as Herne the Hunter .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As Herne the Hunter, he rode a nightmare and wore a black skull mask and a crown of antlers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A long time before Corellon 's battle with Gruumsh , an incarnation or avatar of Herne came to the world of Toril and was slain by the native deity Malar . Years later, when a young Araushnee went looking to recruit Malar she found and gazed upon the shadowy remains of Herne.</p>
<p>Around the time of the rise of Netheril , a wave of planar immigrants came from another world and settled on Toril. One of these groups of people came from a rugged land with a culture tied to nature, the sea, and the warrior history of its dozen-king greater god . They brought with them their own style of society and faiths, with the worship of Celtic deities. This included a new incarnation of Herne, who would become corrupted.</p>
<p>This Herne was worshiped by orc tribes in northwest Faerûn 's High Forest, including the Bloody Eye , Horned Lord , Sharpspike , and Tanglethorn tribes by the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<p>Eventually, during the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR , Herne was challenged and defeated once more in battle by Malar, who then proceeded to assume his portfolio and identity.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the High Forest orcs ' faith in Herne Hurkgruum would remain strong. During the Gray Migrations out of the High Forest in 1372 DR , they took it with them through the Delimbiyr Vale and Graypeak Mountains .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Herne was said to wield a spear called "Boarskewer".</p>
<h2>Holy Symbol</h2>
<p>His symbol to the High Forest orcs was a single antler, usually drawn as a stylized pictograph.</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Notably, Herne the Huntmaster was revered by the High Forest orcs, instead of the typical orc pantheon . His priests were almost entirely adepts and druids , as well as a few clerics .</p>
