<p>Karmak trees were a type of tree found growing in a few isolated groves in the Winto Forest in the Bashan Do Province of T'u Lung .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Karmaks were viewed as almost useless because their wood warped after curing and was heavy with an oily sap. A key exception was their use in producing flame eggs . The sap needed to be refined and distilled into a fine oil, with a more pure oil resulting in more effective eggs .</p>
