<p>Keymaking sets were sets of tools meant to be used in conjunction by rogues to replicate borrowed or stolen keys in leu of picking locks .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Keymaking sets typically consisted of a variety of key wax pads or molds , files , small blades, metal-working instruments, and a small oil -burning apparatus for use in softening and molding any soft metal being used to make a replica key.</p>
<p>Any skillful thief could make an exact copy of a key after taking a wax imprint of it. However, the process was time consuming and required skillful hands. Even then, the keys produced by these sets were rough in appearance and didn't resemble the work of professional keymakers or locksmiths .</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
