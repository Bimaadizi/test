<h2>Personality</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sirrus was born in a hamlet near Ravens Bluff . His family were merchants. He became an apprentice to the Temple of Tyr at age fourteen and became a full cleric at eighteen. He spent three years in service to the temple and chief clerics and then left to travel the world and seek adventure.</p>
<p>Fourteen years later, Sirrus returned to his home temple and the high priest appointed him as representative to the Clerical Circle . After the Chief Prelate died the Circle was in disagreement as to who should replace him and Sirrus was seemed to strike a balance that all considered an acceptable candidate. This recognition boosted his reputation and he was later selected to be the city's new High Priest of Tyr.</p>
