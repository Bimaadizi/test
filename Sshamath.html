<p>Sshamath or the City of Dark Weavings was a drow city located in the Gauth Grottoes below the Far Hills .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sshamath was established in −4973 DR by the Lolth -worshiping drow house Sshamath . It was a standard drow city for nearly 2000 years. Then, in −2867 DR , it was discovered that the city's local faerzress was fluctuating badly. Five years later it was gone and the city was gravely weakened.</p>
<p>Around three centuries previously, the Matron Mothers of the city had given birth to an unusually large number of male children. This contributed to a large increase in the number of wizards , and a decrease in the number of priestesses. Thanks to the lack of nearby threats, the house wizards set about plundering the ruins of lost civilizations, such as Netheril and Oghrann . They took and duplicated every magical item that they could find, using them to instigate a very short civil war that killed all of the house matriarchs and replaced them with wizards. Thereafter, practitioners of the Art reigned supreme.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Lost Keep, 1379 DR , Q'arlynd Melarn was accepted into the Conclave of the School of Ancient Arcana. That same year, after the High Magic ritual that transformed those drow not tainted by Wendonai 's blood and hundreds (but not all) among the followers of Eilistraee into their original dark elf forms, Seldszar Elpragh , Master of the College of Divination, revealed that the College of Ancient Arcana and the College of Divination would be relocated to the surface city of Rhymanthiin , the City of Hope, which was ruled by the sharn .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Sorcerers, bards, and divine spellcasters were treated as secondary citizens because magic that was earned through work was much more respected than magic that came naturally or from deference to another.</p>
<p>The city was ruled over by the Conclave of Sshamath , an oligarchy composed of one representative from each of the eight schools of magical specialization , one who did not specialize, and one who was elected from among the more esoteric arcane practitioners ( elemental savants , deep diviners , etc. ). The conclave rarely actually met, except when they needed to discuss an issue that did not like within one school's assigned responsibilities or to resolve a dispute them.</p>
<p>The shadow adept Nurissa Vyllshan wanted to have users of the Shadow Weave accepted as an official school and thus become eligible for a conclave seat. Unfortunately for her and her followers, the worship of Shar was frowned upon by the other wizards and this threatened the power of the already established members. However, some argued that the practitioners of such magic should operate with conclave support rather than go unregulated.</p>
<p>The city itself was a major trading center for all things magical. One could find nearly anything a wizard could possibly want in the Dark Weavings Bazaar. If something was not available, it could likely be procured for an exorbitant fee by adventurers (including non-drow) for hire.</p>
<p>Slavery was also treated differently here than in other drow cities. While it was widely practiced in Sshamath as in other drow cities, races considered capable of wizardry such as humans , elves , svirfneblin , and deep Imaskari were never kept as slaves by citizens, and those who came to the city from outside and demonstrated an aptitude for wizardry were considered free in the eyes of Sshamath law. However, since only drow could be citizens, these others formed a lower class that inhabited a ghetto. The Conclave did not allow them to grow too numerous and used them as scapegoats and sacrificial lambs. Otherwise, races thought too "primitive" for wizardry, like goblins , grimlocks , minotaurs , ogres , chitines , and others, were freely kept as slaves. Even if one of them did demonstrate arcane magic, they were regarded as anomalies or novelties, not as evidence for their race as a whole.</p>
