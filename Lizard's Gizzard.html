<p>The Lizard's Gizzard was a boarding house that operated in Daggerford during the late 15 th century DR . It was owned by a half-orc woman named Sasha who had a soft spot for those people that society cast away.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It was located on the north side of the town's Money Quarter , on the southern side of Duke's Way.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>While its sign featured rather gruesome depiction of the young Tyndal eviscerating a lizardfolk marauder, the Lizard's Gizzard was a place of altruism. Its staff comprised many young women that were left orphaned and abandoned.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The establishment was wholly dedicated to offering folks a place to stay at night. It offered nothing in the way of libations or provisions.</p>
