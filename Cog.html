<p>A cog was a small, one masted sailing ship used on the Sea of Fallen Stars . Another ship, also called a cog, had two masts and was a larger version of the coaster .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The smaller version of cog had only one mast and, because of its small size and limited space for provisions, it was not seaworthy enough for long ocean voyages. A cog had a rounded hull made from sturdy wood. It had only a partial deck; that is, a deck only covered its ends. It had raised bow and stern platforms, but these were open, not enclosed. A cog was about 40 feet long and 20 feet wide and the deck came about ten feet out of the water. It could carry 40 tons of cargo.</p>
<p>A cog required at least four crew members to man the vessel at all times and could carry a compliment of 20 crew and passengers. Its sailing speed was two miles per hour in light winds.</p>
<p>The larger version had two masts with square sails and cargo capacity similar to a caravel . The minimum crew size was 10 with a maximum of 25. It was 85 ft (26 m) long at the keel and 20 ft (6 m) across the beam. It usually had only one deck and could be outfitted with fore- and sterncastles. It was capable of carrying one large weapon (such as a catapult or ballista ) but was not built to wield a ram. The larger version was fairly seaworthy.</p>
<p>A typical cog took three months to build within a small shipyard.</p>
