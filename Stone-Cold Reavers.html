<p>The Stone-Cold Reavers were a group of reckless adventurers led by Syleen Wintermoon in the Sword Coast North in the late 15 th century DR . When there were suitable jobs, they made their living as sellswords. However, when honest work was unavailable, they turned to criminal activities, resorting to brigandry and thievery.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The group tried to steal the presumed treasure hoard of the young white dragon Cryovain from its lair, Icespire Hold . They waited for the dragon to leave its lair so they could raid it in its absence. However, Cryovain hadn't amassed any treasure yet.</p>
