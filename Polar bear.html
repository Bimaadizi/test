<p>Polar bears were a type of bear adapted to cold environs. They were favored by the polar god Ulutiu .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Polar bears had white coats and were long and lean. When standing, they stood taller than brown bears .</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>A polar bear was a superb swimmer. Its white coat also gave it an advantage when hunting in snowy areas.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>When a polar bear attacked, it primarily used its powerful claws, tearing at its prey, as well as its bite. It would also pull its opponents into a grapple.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Polar bears heavily populated the region of Nakalpgotak on the Great Glacier . They preyed upon many animals, including even those as large as ghost roth√© .</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>Polar bear meat was barely edible to most people. It was tough and stringy and hard to digest. The Iulutiuns ate polar bear meat and used its fur for clothing.

White dragons and tirichik also preyed upon polar bears.</p>
