<p>Elveronne Bricket was a cruel and strict nobleman from Daggerford who was murdered by his two sisters, Alicine and Muriel Bricket in 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In his undead state, Elveronne Bricket was an embalmed intelligent shambling zombie with his eyes glowing red hot with vengeance.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Elveronne was a notoriously cruel man. He was known to chase beggars away from his property who accidentally stumbled on it. People who knew him considered him a penny-pinching and domineering individual, especially despised by his two sisters.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Brickets owned a lavish country home on the scenic bank of the Delimbiyr River in the Western Heartlands several hours beyond the walls of Daggerford. The three-story cottage had a sizable cellar and its own little pier.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Elveronne Bricket was a member of Daggerford's nobility who constantly feuded with his sisters over money, the family estate management, and repayment of old-standing family depts. The man kept a long series of detailed journals of his personal and business activities in which he referred to his siblings as "money-grabbing loafers" and "unworthy of bearing the name Bricket."</p>
<p>At one point in his long lost youth, Elveronne was hopelessly in love with a wood elven young lass. The love of his life, the young woman with jade -colored eyes and sun-kissed skin haunted the man's memories many decades after their romance was disturbed. The love was ended by the woman's father who forbade the relationship, leaving Elveronne Bricket with nothing but a memory and a precious elven keepsake necklace that he vowed to forever keep close to his aching heart.</p>
<p>The long series of conflicts with his dear siblings led Elveronne to threaten to write his sisters out of his will. However, he mysteriously perished before that could happen.</p>
<p>Most believed that innocent and sweet old sisters had nothing to do with the death of their brother and even celebrated the death of the horrible old man. His body was embalmed and entombed following the wake. However, old man Bricket did not stay dead. To complete terror and embarrassment of Moris Olgrund , the mortician, the body of Elveronne rose, opened the tomb, and disappeared. Fearful for the old man's two sisters and the heartbreak it would bring them, Moris asked the individual later known as the Hero of Daggerford to find the body, and it if were an undead, douse it with holy water .</p>
<p>In reality, Elveronne Bricket was fueled by pure darkness and hatred. He rose from the dead and left the Bricket family crypt after his sister Alicine stole Elveronne's most precious possession during the wake - enchanted elven keepsake necklace . As a shambling dead, he headed to the family's country house in the Western Heartlands. On a quest for vengeance, the only thing Elveronne wanted was the death of his murderous sisters.</p>
<p>The zombie found a way into the Bricket Homestead basement as the party to celebrate the old man's departure from the land of the living raged above him. The Hero of Daggerford arrived during the merriment to investigate the disappearance of Elveronne's body. Once sisters realized the mercenary was there for their "beloved" brother, both excused themselves from the party and headed to the second floor of the manor, attempting to hide any evidence there might be of the murder. Feverishly trying to hide any evidence of foul play, sisters rosed suspicions of the Hero. The investigation subsequently revealed that Muriel was the murderer. The portly woman served her brother a poisoned fish .</p>
<p>The Hero confronted Elveronne Bricket in the manor's basement. Ignoring the creature's undead form, the Hero communicated with Elveronne and discovered that the undead wanted revenge or his precious keepsake returned. However, it was unknown if the Hero poured the holy water on Elveronne, destroying him, negotiated the return of the enchanted elven keepsake necklace , or allowed old man Bricket to exact his murderous revenge. One thing was clear - in the end, Elveronne Bricket was returned to eternal rest, one way or another.</p>
