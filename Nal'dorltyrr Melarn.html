<p>Nal'dorltyrr Melarn was a drider and weapons master of House Melarn in 1479 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nal'dorltyrr was appointed as weapons master in 1469 DR after the elder boy and previous weapon master was killed at a party. This was a scandal in the city because no drider had never held such a powerful position. However, Nal'dorltyrr proved that his ability with weapons was unrivaled in his house. He was constantly challenged by rivals, but Nal'dorltyrr had defeated them all.</p>
