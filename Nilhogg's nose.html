<p>Nilhogg's nose was a small fungus that grew in the Underdark . It was edible, but provided no nutrition. When consumed, it enhanced the sense of smell for one to four hours, improving the chance of detecting and/or identifying odors. However, under the influence of this mushroom, the consumer was also more vulnerable to the effects of smells, such as the nauseating stench of a ghast , for example.</p>
