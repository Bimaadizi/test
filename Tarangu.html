<p>The Tarangu was a tribe of halflings who inhabited an area of Jazayir al-Sartan in southwest Zakhara .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Tarangu did not build permanent structures on the ground. Instead they lived in special nests constructed in palm trees . Ropes hung between nests so the halflings could get around without touching the ground.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>These war-like halfings were rumored to be cannibalistic, though in actuality they subsisted upon groves of coconut palms and plantains that they maintained. Their diets were supplemented by fish , land crabs , snails , and the occasional wild boar .</p>
<p>Slavers often targeted the halflings since they did not follow the path of Enlightenment .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>

<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>These people were semi-nomadic and only carried what they needed to travel between the islands.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The Tarangu were ruled by a halfling named Indeema , who was an obese matron. She was a priest of Kar'r'rga and supervised all sacrifices made to the savage god.</p>
