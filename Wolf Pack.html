<p>Wolf Pack was a mercenary company that hailed from Icewind Dale and led by Jon Kellan , the the Gray Wolf.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Wolf Pack was assembled in the north Faer√ªn by Jon "Gray Wolf " Kellan. There they developed a reputation of being fierce battlers. Subsequently, they moved their operations from Icewind Dale to Waterdeep . Sometime later, their activities attracted the attention of one of the Lords of Waterdeep . On the unnamed lord's behest, the Wolf Pack set out against agents of the Zhentarim who planned to attack the City of Splendors. The Pack entered a battle, outnumbered by the Black Network but all, including the Gray Wolf himself, perished. The only survivors were three Zhents. Even though this mission was their last, the Wolf Pack saved the City of Splendors by forcing the Black Network to halt their plans.</p>
