<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ralgorax died in battle alongside his horse , yet many years later—when both were little more than shriveled corpses—they rode again as undead to defend Ralgorax's home village from a nighttime attack by a horde of orcs . He rode through the village while banging his sword and shield to rouse and warn the people, and then fought off the orcish scouts until dawn. But in the light of day, the villagers were disgusted to see his undead appearance, so he sadly saluted them before charging to meet the horde head-on.</p>
