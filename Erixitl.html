<h2>History</h2>
<p>At the age of 10, Erixitl was taken captive and held as a slave in the city of Kultaka . After being attacked by the son of her owner, Erixitl was sold to Kachin , a cleric of the god Qotal in Ulatos . Kachin freed Erixitl and told her she was to become a priestess. However, Erix was kidnapped by a priest of Zaltec and taken to be sacrificed at a pyramid on top of the Twin Visages . She managed to escape and the daughter of an Amnnian bishop of Helm was sacrificed in her place, which led to war between the Golden Legion and Ulatos . Erixitl was nearly killed during the battle between the Amnians and Ulatans but the Legionnaire Halloran rescued her.</p>
<p>Halloran and Erixitl escaped into the jungle, eventually making their way to Nexal . Erixitl had visions of the destruction of Nexal and she wanted to do everything in her power to prevent this from happening. Erix and Halloran had a disagreement and Erix traveled back to her home village of Palul . She arrived just before the Golden Legion and she was pressed into service as a translator. Erixitl survived the massacre at Palul and was once again rescued by Hal, who had raced to Palul when he heard the Legion was heading to the village.</p>
<p>Hal was seriously injured by a fellow Legionnaire and Erix nursed him back to health. Hal and Erix were married by her father and he gave them both powerful feathermagic bracers as a wedding gift. Afterwards, the couple journeyed back to Nexal in a desperate attempt to prevent a war between the Golden Legion and Nexal.</p>
