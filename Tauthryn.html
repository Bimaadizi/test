<p>Tauthryn the Mad was a mage of Turmish of the 12 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tauthryn's habit was using his magic to breed monsters, including bulettes , perytons , and even strange hybrids of all kinds, which naturally made him notorious. Finally, adventurers killed him for it.</p>
<p>However, over two hundred years later, by the midâ€“14 th century DR , the descendants of his creations could still be found wandering Turmish. Some may have bred, while others may have been recreated by deepspawn .</p>
