<p>Bright Nydra ( pronounced : /ˈ b r aɪ t ˈ n aɪ d r ɑː / BRIGHT NIGH-dra ) was a demigod and later an aspect of Selûne .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nydra had two avatars , one was a pale-skinned human woman, wrapped from head to toe in a toga of her own silver hair. Said skin was tinged with blue highlights. Her eyes were noted to have a strange focus about them, as if concentrating on things that were no longer apparent. She is also noted as having a fey-like beauty.</p>
<p>Her other avatar was that of a shaft of bright moonlight run through with silver faerie fire .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Bright Nydra was noted as being a caring deity, but her emotions changed with the phases of the moon. When she was upset, she would put on a cheery and hopeful facade.</p>
<h2>Divine Realm</h2>
<p>Nydra had no divine realm, as she dwelled bodily upon Toril .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Nydra appeared to those who were depressed and/or lost. She would attempt to cheer them up and lead the lost home. When mortals had earned her favor, she placed tear-shaped diamonds for them to find.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Bright Nydra was allied with Chauntea , Eldath , Lathander , and Mielikki - all of whom are part of the pantheon of deities led by Nydra who were worshiped by the Marsh Drovers.</p>
<p>She counted Auril as an enemy.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nydra was said to have been the daughter of Selûne and Shaundakul , who fell to Faerûn from the Tears of Selûne , supposedly in the 4th century Dalereckoning on a midwinter night. She appeared as a human woman to refugees fleeing a goblinoid horde in the High Moors north of the Storm Horns , leading them west into the Farsea Marshes where they would became the Marsh Drovers.</p>
<p>At some point after this, Selûne absorbed her divine essence, making Nydra an aspect of herself rather than a separate entity.</p>
<p>During the Time of Troubles , after escaping his imprisonment in High Horn , Nydra is said to have defeated the avatar of Bhaal and driven him out of the Farsea Marshes while he was pursuing Midnight .</p>
