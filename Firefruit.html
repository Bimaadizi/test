<p>Firefruit , or amberglow , was a sweet berry that grew every three to four years on certain species of flowering mosses and lichens in North Faer√ªn .</p>
<p>When
seen, protruding from hair-thin stalks out of the scabrous fungi, they can be eaten with surety,
because there's nothing poisonous or inedible that looks like firefruit.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Firefruits were small, tough-skinned berries with their centers filled with gooey and sweet like honey flesh. These berries grew on hair-thin stalks. Most mosses and lichens in the Savage Frontier never flowered, and it took the most experienced rangers and expert foresters to know how to identify the berry-bearing vegetation. However, when found, amberglow could be eaten without any reservations as the berries were edible and there were no poisonous berries that could be mistaken for them.</p>
