<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Bohemund the Belligerent entertained passersby on the Market Triangle 's central plaza with displays of magic. However, it did not impress the locals, who thought that even a well-trained monkey could do Bohemund's magic. In response, Bohemund challenged the hecklers to perform the same magic, and when the hecklers couldn't, he stated them to be below the level of a well-trained monkey.</p>
