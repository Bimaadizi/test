<p>Gaspar-shen was a watersoul genasi adventurer , sailor , and swordsman active in the Moonshae Isles as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gasper-shen was shorter than the average genasi . He wore very little clothing, favoring simply a pair of eel -skin breeches . Across the blue skin of his exposed torso and bald head, lines of energy glowed with different colors depending on his emotional state. He had small lips and seemed incapable of smiling.</p>
<p>His voice was eerie and airless, sounding calm but with a high-pitched, almost whistling quality.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He had a pure and emotional connection to elemental water , and embodied its chaotic and free associative nature. He had no interest in directing events to better suit him, and he took joy in moments of quiet, even if they occurred while he was in danger. He had no desire to make or build things, although the ingredients and efforts that went into baking desserts and pastries fascinated him. He spoke frequently about exotic desserts, some real and others clearly imagined. While he sometimes expressed an interest in trying such delicacies, in truth he had no interest in the desserts themselves and never ate them. Instead, his interest was metaphorical, and he discussed desserts as a way to express his feelings about current events and predicaments. He rarely spoke directly or literally except in dire situations, and it was often hard to tell if he was joking. He had no patience for music.</p>
<p>When aboard a ship, Gasper-shen spent his time laying on his stomach on the bow, feeling the spray and sensing the depth and movement of the water beneath him. He slept very little.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He was vigilant, and quick to warn his comrades of any potential or incoming dangers. He was a skilled combatant, and wielded a scimitar that burned with cold fire in one hand and a shortsword in the other. He favored targeting his opponents' torsos and bellies.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was a member of the crew of the Sphinx , alongside his captain, Lukas , as well as Suka , the Savage , Marikke , and Kip . He had a long history with Lukas in particular, although the human sometimes struggled to relate to and understand the genasi. Gasper-shen respected and deferred to his captain, although not always without sarcasm (especially when Lukas led them to take idiotic risks).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gasper-shen hailed from the deserts of Calimshan , but his soul was said to be from Abeir and he regarded the Elemental Chaos as his true place of birth. At some point, he made his way to the Moonshae Isles, an environment that was much more welcoming to his water-oriented body and spirit. There, he partnered with Lukas and the two of them worked for Amnian interests transporting cargo aboard the Sphinx between Snowdown and Alaron .</p>
<p>In the late 1470s DR, Lukas accepted a job to escort Lord Aldon Kendrick to the ruins of Caer Corwell in Sarifal , which turned into a quest to kill Lady Amaranth , a princess of the le Shay rulers of Sarifal, who led a group of lycanthropes on the island of Moray . The crew of the Sphinx was soon scattered, with Suka being imprisoned in Caer Corwell and the Savage, Marikke, and Kip being captured by the Black Blood tribe after the Sphinx was destroyed by fire nagas . Meanwhile, Gasper-shen had rescued Lukas from drowning in the shipwreck, and so the pair of them set out to find and rescue their abducted companions. Instead, they got lost, and after following Lukas's lead in ambushing a raiding party of orcs , Gasper-shen received a serious head wound. He only survived thanks to the intervention of Lady Amaranth and her followers, who brought him to Caer Moray to recover. After he was stabilized, he spent much of his time in a bathtub of salt water as he recovered, but was forced into action once again when the Black Blood laid siege to Caer Moray.</p>
<p>Following the Battle of Caer Moray , Gasper-shen traveled with Lukas and Amaranth back to Sarifal, and came to learn the fates of their lost crewmates along the way. Gasper-shen remained by Lukas and Amaranth's side as they were captured by drow cultists of Araushnee in the Underdark . They escaped that predicament with Araushnee's own blessing, and as they did so, she granted Gasper-shen a vision of his future, standing on a rocky beach far away. Pondering this vision, he asked Amaranth (who had her own reckoning with the goddess) what food she desired most, and when she answered " ortolans "—a bird that was killed and prepared in a grotesque manner—he determined that he did not trust her around Lukas. He bade her to leave him, which was incidentally what Araushnee wanted of her as well.</p>
<p>Gasper-shen and Lukas were ultimately reunited with Suka just as Amaranth left them to negotiate their safe escape from the armies of the le Shay Prince Araithe . The three of them then left Sarifal by boat.</p>
