<p>A topi was a type of small undead .</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>A topi was created by shrinking a corpse to two feet tall, and then cutting out its heart and replacing it with a live poisonous snake in a leather bag. The snake would stay alive without food or air, and simultaneously render the topi's claws venomous. The snake would die when the topi died.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>A significant number of topis resided on the Snout of Omgar , particularly near the ruins of Dangwaru .</p>
