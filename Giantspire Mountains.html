<h2>History</h2>
<p>The mountains gained their name from the tribes of giants that occupied them.</p>
<p>Around 1097 DR , the hobgoblins of the Giantspire Mountains assaulted the newly formed Impiltur but were driven back by the might of Warcaptain Imphras of Lyrabar .</p>
<p>In 1127 DR , Imphras' son, King Imbrar I , was lost in the mountains, while leading a campaign to eradicate the hobgoblin tribe. Expeditions in the following years, such as one led by the mercenary captain Delros Parander in 1275 DR , would fail to find him.</p>
<p>In 1372 DR , the hobgoblins of the Giantspires were led by King Kardobbik . To aid her king, Lady Farkattle animated the corpse of a very old deep dragon to instill fear in Kardobbik's subjects and intruders into his realm.</p>
<p>Prior to 1385 DR , many of the goblinoid tribes of the Giantspires served the succubus demon lord Soneillon , however she was flung from Toril during the Spellplague , leaving behind two powerful artifacts—the Crowns of Whispers —of which her goblin servants were quick to make use.</p>
<p>As of 1479 DR , a three-way conflict brewed in the mountains between powerful goblinoid tribes: the Blood Mountain tribe, the Razor Heart tribe, and the Black Wolf clan. Both the queen of Razor Heart, Maaqua , and the chief of the Black Wolves, Aruugan , possessed a Crown of Whispers .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Neither the Nar tribes nor the people from Damara occupied these lands. The peaks were held by hobgoblins, bugbears , and evil cloud giants , and were home to wandering tribes of stone and hill giants as well as ogres .</p>
