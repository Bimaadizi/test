<p>Thelvyn Kip was a Harper agent, active in the Savage Frontier and Northwest Faerûn in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Thelvyn Kip, or simply Kip to her friends, was a sword -wielding elven woman with tan skin and white hair.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point in the late 15 th century DR, Thelvyn Kip worked together with Edgin Darvis , then still a fellow member of the Harpers. The two agents fought side by side in the city of Daggerford on at least two occasions. Eventually, Edgin left the organization after the death of his wife. About ten years after leaving the Harpers, now a father of a teenage daughter, Edgin became a hustler and a thief.</p>
<p>After an unfortunate confrontation with a spell-slinging Zhentarim agent, Edgin and his band ( Simon Aumar , Holga Kilgore , and Forge Fitzwilliam ) became stranded in the town of Womford , near the River Dessarin during the procession commiserating the Feast of the Moon . Kira , Edgin's daughter and a fellow thief, by chance, approached becloaked Thelvyn asking for directions. The ex-Harper walked passed her, but Kip recognized him instantly. The following morning, the elven Harper approached Edgin happily, greeting her old comrade only to receive a cold shoulder and little recognition from the thief. Edgin's band decided to pull the "Local's Gambit" – find a source of local strife, promise the townies to take care of it, collect donations to the cause and flee. Thelvyn Kip was under the impression Edgin sought to help the village and invited herself along to dispatch the so-called Bandit King. However, she soon realized that Ed's band was swindling locals while Kira was stealing from them while invisible.</p>
<p>Kip was disappointed in Ed, declaring that she liked the old comrade better than the thief standing before her. Edgin and his band did not escape the village; instead, they were captured by several men and undead creatures who served the Bandit King. Subsequently, Kip was captured and shackled as well. The prisoners met the true Bandit King – a greedy dracolich Glyrgoth . With a masterful application of Simon's magic, Kip and the thieves escape the dracolich's lair, but not before filling their pockets with the beast's hoard. Thelvyn Kip menacingly suggested the thieves return the stolen gold to the townsfolk.</p>
<p>The group ended up escaping via a mine cart that led them out of the caves and dropped them into the cold waters of the Dessarin. Unfortunately for Kip and the thieves, most of the loot ended up on the river's bottom.</p>
