<p>Dwenthor's cape of bravery was an enchanted cloak created by a Cormyrean War Wizard named Dwenthor of the Winds sometime before 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This cape was enchanted to protect the wearer from normal and magical cold and glowed with blue radiance, illuminating 15 feet (4.6 meters) round it. Additional magics imbued into the cloak significantly enhanced the wearer's skills of persuasion.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dwenthor's cape of bravery was enchanted by Dwenthor of the Winds for his young paramour at the time, Xanda Pennywell of Liam's Hold . The item was created to protect Xanda from harsh Sword Coast winters. Another reason for the cape's enchantment and its name was somewhat selfish. Dwenthor was a deserter and a coward. He hoped that Xanda would be able to convince her lover, using the cape's magics, to be brave. However, the romance soon ended after mercenaries hired by War Wizards found Dwenthor and escorted him back to his service to the nation of Cormyr .</p>
<p>Xanda Pennywell held onto the magic item in case she ever needed coin . She still possessed the cape in 1372 DR when she was abducted by a drow vampire Sieronius Dethick , who was planning on using his magical charms to find a wife and with that break the curse that kept him imprisoned underneath Liam's Hold. Accounts of the events remained varied; some said that Xanda was rescued by the Hero of Daggerford and she offered Dwenthor's cape of bravery to the Hero in gratitude.</p>
