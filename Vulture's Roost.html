<p>Vulture's Roost was the fortified stronghold and mansion of the Dalefolk warlord Aleta Vanmarwin , named for her alias "The Vulture", in the late-14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The structure was located in Battledale , [ speculation ] atop a hill that overlooked the southernmost branch of the River Ashaba , close to where it met the Glaemril River . It was roughly a three days walk from Eoghan's grove , part of the Hunter's Down .</p>
<p>Its hill was formerly the site of a grove full of treants . On its northern side, where there was no palisade coverage, it had a steep 200‑foot (61‑meter) high cliff face, worn away by erosion. The southern side of the hill had a more gradual ascent and was dotted with stumps left over from its former grove. A wide footpath lead up the hill to the stronghold's gates.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The stronghold was surrounded on three sides by a wooden palisade, which was constructed from the remains of not only trees, but several treants that were chopped down when the hill's grove was cleared. The vertical logs that made up the 15 feet (4.6 meters) high pallisade were tightly arranged, had sharpened tips, and were embedded 4 feet (1.2 meters) deep into the hilltop's packed earth and hard clay . The sturdy gates of the pallisade were 10 feet (3 meters) tall and latched from the inside with a heavy bar of oak .</p>
<p>Within the confines of the palisade were six elevated wooden platforms that served as watchtowers. Elevated atop sturdy tree trunks legs, each stood 20 feet (6.1 meters) tall, were enclosed by 4‑foot (1.2‑meter) high wooden walls, and accessible by wooden ladders . Of the six watchtowers, two of them flanked the pallisade's gate.</p>
<p>After entering the gates one would be confronted by the compound's stables and storage shed. The stables two sets of sliding doors and six stalls enclosed by gates, each of which was outfitted with a manger and trough . Whilst the shed housed the bulk of the stronghold's nonperishable supplies, such as coils of ropes , horseshoes , tools, loose wooden planks, barrels of water drawn from the River Ashaba in case of fires, and casks of lantern oil , nails , and pitch .</p>
<p>On the eastern side of the compound was a freshwater well, consisting of a 3‑foot (0.91‑meter) high stone ring. The well's shaft was 5 feet (1.5 meters) and had a depth of 150 feet (46 meters). To draw water out of its subterranean cistern was a wooden winch with a rope and bucket . Beyond the well stood a row of wooden outhouses, each of which had a wooden bench with a chamber pot tucked underneath it. Notably, the southernmost outhouse had a spare house key hidden in the grass against it. At the southeastern most end of the stronghold was a 10‑foot (3‑meter) deep pit, used by the Vulture's brigands to detain any locals who refused to pledge fealty to the authority of the Vulture.</p>
<p>On the western side of the compound were its barracks and graveyard, enclosed by a plain wooden fence. Around 1369 DR , the graves of fallen soldiers numbered fourteen in total. The barracks were a single story structure, composed of wood, with a pitched ceiling that was reinforced with oaken rafters. In total it held up to ten bunkbeds, though only about half were occupied at any given time.</p>
<p>The centerpiece of the stronghold was a stone mansion, also known as the Vulture's Estate. A regal structure built as much to provide comfort as it was defense, it stood two stories tall and had five entrances in total. A main entrance in the south, two guard entrances in the north, and an entrance for servants in the east. The building had a pitched roof, tightly fitted with clay tiles, and pierced at multiple points by chimneys. On the eastern and western sides of the roof were gables. And on the exterior walls of the estate hung large black banners, emblazoned with Aleta's personal symbol, a golden and stylized depiction of a vulture 's claw. Over time these banners became tattered and worn by the Dalelands' weather.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Though the estate predominantly stone, its interior floors, walls, and rafters were all composed of solid oak. For the majority of its rooms, the ceilings had a height clearance of 15 ft (4.6 m). The rooms on the ground floor lacked windows, whilst those on the four upper floors of the building had neatly spaced out windows. These were all multipaned, wood framed windows, with the smaller frames each holding a thick square pane of glass that measured 6 inches (0.15 meters). The ground floor also had arrow slits carved out at various points in its exterior and interior walls, each measuring 4 ft (1.2 m) in height and 5 ft (1.5 m) in width.</p>
<p>All rooms in the mansion were provided illumination by by oil lanterns and a number of fireplaces. These lanterns were typically hung from ceiling beams or rafters by iron chains or placed within wall brackets. And most of the fireplaces had chimneys that were too narrow for a creature to climb through.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The servant staff of Vulture's Roost worked eighteen- bell shifts, waking up five bells after midnight and retiring to their quarters one bell before midnight. Whenever it was time to empty the compound's outhouses, servants would dump their chamber pots over the cliff edge, down into the waters of the River Ashaba.</p>
<p>The soldiers who lived at the stronghold were usually found in their barracks when off duty. Between three to one bells before midnight, one could find the soldiers joined by their lieutenants in nightly games of gambling, such as Three-Dragon Ante .</p>
<p>A startling amount of the compound's funds were put towards acquiring rare ingredients and rare, hard-to-find recipes for the kitchen. This was due to Aleta Vanmarwin having a taste for gourmet food.</p>
<p>A cask of poisoned wine was kept on standby in the kitchen for whenever the estate had guests over, regardless of who they were. As part of standard procedure, The Vulture would imbibe the antidote for the poison, leaving the wine to be served to those whom she didn't trust or was displeased with.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The angry spirits of the treants built into the stronghold's palisade were bound to the defensive wall by the magic of a young witch , making them lash out indiscriminately at the living with necrotic energy .</p>
<p>Copies of keys to all of the stronghold's doors were possessed by Aleta, her lieutenants, and all of her servants. And besides Aleta herself, only the lieutenants and servants could access the mansion's war room without her express permission.</p>
<p>Soldiers manned with crossbows were stationed at each of the stronghold's six watchtowers at all hours of the day, making it difficult to sneak up on the stronghold. They wore suits of studded leather and carried short swords in case of close quarters combat. When guests were entertained in the grand hall, these sharpshooters would aim their sights on the first floor's arrow slits, prepared to strike at a moment's notice. At the same time, guards were stationed indoors behind walls with their own arrow slits, allowing them to monitor a situation. And the Vulture's two lieutentants would be manning the indoor balconies of the grand hall.</p>
<p>Additionally, at the head of the feast hall's table a longsword was strapped to its underside. For similar reasons, the war room had six longswords strapped to its underside, ensuring that the Vulture would never be caught unarmed.</p>
<p>Upon any sign of enemies the sharpshooters would shout an alarm. To ensure her other soldiers would be ready at a moments notice to answer any alarm, the Vulture's soldiers were trained to sleep in their chainmail and kept weapons either under their pillows or by the side of their bunks. Similarly, the lieutenants kept their weapons near their bedsides. The standard armaments for the brigands included crossbows and halberds .</p>
<p>The northern side of the hill was undefended, proving to be a weakpoint in the stronghold's defenses, as the sheer cliffs there had numerous hand and footholds to climb with. However, the ledges and outcroppings of its cliff was the site of numerous dove nests, which would surely alert the brigands when disturbed.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime around the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR . using the spoils amassed from her many years as a mercenary in various conflicts across the Eastern Heartlands , Aleta Vanmarwin gathered various outlaws under her banner and constructed Vulture's Roost.</p>
<p>Around the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the Harper spies Elariel Taias and Kimach Taias were discovered in the vicinity of Vulture's Roost, shadowing a patrol of the Vulture's brigands. They managed to capture Kimach, but only wounded Elariel before she fled deep into the woods, eventually escaping into Eoghan's grove. The titular treant Eoghan , a longtime ally of the Harpers, provided Elariel shelter and managed to convince some dryad allies to create false trails leading away from the grove. As hoped, her pursuers eventually gave up on looking for Elariel and returned to Vulture's Roost with their sole captive.</p>
<p>With a member of the Harpers in captivity, over the coming week the Vulture invited Zhent warmage Toren Witherfield and his envoy of representatives to Vulture's Roost, planning a grand feast and to present Kimach before them as an offering. Aleta Vanmarwin hoped that this would be just what she needed to further solidify her worth in the eyes of the Zhentarim and securing their aid in expanding her influence over Battledale and Tasseldale . She also believed that this would serve to fan the flames of the conflict between the Harpers and the Zhents, keeping them distracted from her own activities, and consequently through their conflict drive more hamlets and villages into seeking protection under her.</p>
<p>Aleta and her servants prepared an extravagant feast for her guests of seven entrées. They set the feast hall's table with magnificent sets of gold dinnerware for sixteen people, fragile crystal wineglasses and decanters , and silver candelabras . On the expected day of the feast, the dwarves worked tirelessly to have everything prepared.</p>
<p>With no other Harpers close by, Elariel spent days trying to persuade Eoghan to help her recover her captured son, but the treant was unwilling to risk falling victim to the same black magic as his fellow treants. A few days before the Zhentarim were expected to arrive, a group of adventurers traveling through Eoghan's grove met the treant and were soon after approached by Elariel, desperate for someone to hear her plea. The heroes ended up agreeing to the mission, being led by Elariel to the Vulture's Roost, and by some accounts may have even convinced Eoghan to accompany them as well. One foggy morning along their three day journey, they encountered near an usurped farmstead four of the Vulture's soldiers, two of them badly injured, standing over the freshly slain corpse of an owlbear .</p>
<p>By the time the adventurers were within sight of Vulture's Roost, the Zhentarim envoy was making its way up the hill. Numbering five in total and riding upon black horses lacking in barding , the Zhent soldiers accompanying the gaunt human wizard Toren Witherfield were outfitted in suits of black scale mail , ominous spiked armet helms , and heavy shields bearing the symbol of their organization.</p>
<p>Sources differ heavily on the approach taken by the adventurers that sought to rescue Kimach Taias. Some say they stormed Vulture's Roost, causing the warlord to flee her keep with her marauding soldiers and took shelter in a ruined manor, others that they apprehended or even killed the Vulture, and still others claimed that they waited to ambush the Zhents after they departed from the keep and therefore Aleta Vanmarwin was left to grow in power.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Aleta was joined in the manor by her two half-orc lieutenants, Darok and Szorp , a pair of outlaw brothers that she had taken in and came to consider as akin to sons. And beneath her personal bed hid an iron cobra , ready to strike at any intruders. It was under strict orders not to attack her lieutenants or dwarven servants.</p>
<p>The servant household of the manor was made up of members of Ironvein , a clan of hill dwarves known throughout Battledale. Considered by the warlord to be the closest thing to family, they were well treated and their counsel trusted in all nonmilitary matters. They in turn were dutifully loyal to her, took pride in their work, and took umbrage with anyone that questioned her hospitality. Unlike all other residents of Vulture's Roost, the Ironveins would only ever refer to her as "Lady Vanmarwin", never as her persona "the Vulture".</p>
<p>Starnbrow Ironvein was the head of the dwarven sisters. His younger sister, Grimvalda , was the head of the kitchen and all were expected to follow her orders. They were joined by Starnbrow's niece, Dunrain , and his nephew, Dezivan . Starnbrow and Dezivan shared the western living quarters, whilst Grimvalda and Dunrain shared the eastern room.</p>
<p>The roost's large defense forces were largely made up of human outlaws, who were adorned in matching black tabards bearing The Vulture's personal symbol. The Vulture did not know all of them personally. When not within the compound they patrolled the lands between Battledale and Tasseldale, south of the Glaemril and the eastern spur of the River Ashaba, robbing caravans of any provisions and weapons. They provided the estate's kitchen with crates, casks, and barrels of all manner of foodstuffs and ingredients from all over the Dalelands. All other trade goods beyond food and weapons were typically sold off.</p>
