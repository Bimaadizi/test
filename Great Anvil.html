<p>The Great Anvil was a scorched wasteland forming the very heart of the Haunted Lands of Zakhara .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Great Anvil stretched for hundreds of miles from the Wall of the Wailing Elephant in the south to the hill country along the fringes of the Furrowed Mountains in the northwest.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This barren wasteland reached temperatures of 130 degrees (54.4 °C) during the daytime and plummeted to below freezing at night. Rainfall never touched the parched sand of the Great Anvil, though violent dust storms were commonplace. The extreme conditions of the Anvil made even the most experienced desert riders halt in their tracks.</p>
<p>Ruins of once great civilizations were scattered throughout the Great Anvil. Some of these ruins were inhabited by elementals .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Great Anvil was the home of the Jann of the Haunted Lands –a collection of different tribes of jann known for their often erratic behavior.</p>
