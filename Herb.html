<p>Herb was a broad term for a variety of plants used for medicinal purposes, crafting drugs and potions , seasoning and garnishing food, providing aromas to food or fragrances, and a variety of other purposes.</p>
<p>Herbs were often dried, ground up into a powder, and tightly packed in order to preserve them.
