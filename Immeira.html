<p>Immeira was an inhabitant of Buckralam's Starn during the mid–8 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Immeira was quite independent, spirited, and willing to fight back.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Though she was as full-figured as any of the bandits' playpretties, she kept her appearance unappealing so as not to draw their attention, by wearing shapeless tunics and vests under a man's robe.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>She knew how to live off the forest.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Immeira's father had been one of the warriors in Taver's Talons , a local, properly chartered adventuring band.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Since the death of her father, roughly around early 753 DR , Immeira had been orphaned and living at the millwright's home. After the Iron Fox took over the town, she started wandering far from town in men's clothes, keeping her hair completely unkempt, and sleeping in barn roofs at night, to keep her figure from drawing the attention of the Fox's men. In late winter of the Year of Laughter, 761 DR , Immeira witnessed a wanderer who came into town and struck down many of the Iron Fox's bandits.</p>
<p>When the man chased one of the bandits into a ditch where she was watching and slew him, the wanderer introduced himself as Wanlorn , and asked for her aid. She quickly familiarized him with the lay of the land. She then helped him fight the relief force that came to replace the previous Foxlings. Some of them escaped, making it to Fox Tower . On that night, Immeira helped Wanlorn defeat the Fox by distracting him while he was on a stair, allowing Elminster to attack him by surprise. Afterward, Immeira shared a romantic evening with Wanlorn, who revealed his real name was Elminster.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Awakening Wyrm, 767 DR , at the conclusion of the Chaos of the Art of that year, Immeira was busy making sense of some papers in Fox Tower, a task she found nigh-impossible. She was overcome then with thoughts of Elminster, and bared her robe at the corner of the room; unknown to her, Mystra was showing Elminster this as part of a vision.</p>
