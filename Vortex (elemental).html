<p>A vortex ( pl : vortexes or : vortices ) was a strange phenomenon of elemental air that sages were unsure as to whether to classify as elementals or merely mindless bubbles of elemental energy drawn from the Elemental Plane of Air .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Vortexes were small, white featureless orbs, roughly the size of a child's ball. They spun around rapidly as they moved, generating a miniature whirlwind around them that was liable to ensnare any demihuman -sized creature that got caught in its path. Their movements had no discernible patterns, being erratic and rarely moving in simple straight lines.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>These creatures showed very little sign of intelligence or even consciousness.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Vortexes were solitary beings that mostly kept to themselves within the Elemental Plane of air. They were never witnessed eating in any matter nor reproducing. They were incapable of being summoned , but could appear as manifestations of the elven deities Aerdrie Faenya and Erevan Ilesere .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Some believed vortexes were spawned by the Elemental Plane of Air itself and subsequently cast out to make a home for themselves. It was also speculated by some that their rapid whirling could be the key to how vortexes sometimes escaped the Elemental Plane of Air.</p>
