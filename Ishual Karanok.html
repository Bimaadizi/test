<p>Ishual Karanok was a member of House Karanok and a leader of Luthcheq in Chessenta in the late 14 th and early 15 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was known for his courageous deeds and insightful leadership.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ishual Karanok rose to prominence after Tchazzar disappeared in the chaos of the Spellplague in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR . He emerged as a war hero and leader who united the divided survivors of Luthcheq . He went on to battle rampaging monsters, aberrations sent by the Abolethic Sovereignty , and opportunistic invaders and colonists from northern lands, and so kept Chessenta alive.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Fallen Friends, 1399 DR , Ishual Karanok merged the different coinages of the city-states of Chessenta into a single currency.</p>
<p>In the early 1400s, Ishual fought his first true engagement with the Abolethic Sovereignty near the village of Samnur . Victorious, he and his forces drove the aboleths' minions back into the sea.</p>
<p>After a time, when the fighting had lessened, he returned to Luthcheq and the Karanok family home. There, Ishual disbanded the murderous cult his family had led, arguing that their goal of destroying all arcane magic and its users had been achieved with Mystra's death. Nevertheless, he kept their god Entropy as a symbol of power.</p>
<h3>Legacy</h3>
<p>Even a century after his death, Ishual was revered as a god-like hero by all Chessentans. Children grew up on stories of his exploits and aspired to be like him. Shala Karanok , his sole descendant, ruled Luthcheq in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
