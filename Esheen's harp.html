<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When played, Esheen's harp caused glass and metal objects within a 30 feet (9.1 meters) radius of its strings to vibrate and resonate, creating an eerie and noticeable effect. If the harpist plucked the lowest string, any glass or metal objects up to 30 feet (9.1 meters) away from the end of the harp's body could shatter instantly into tiny fragments. The harp affected all items within the 1 foot (30 centimeters)-wide path of effect, leaving no option to spare some objects while targeting others.</p>
