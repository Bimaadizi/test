<p>Yael ( pronounced : /ˈ j eɪ ɛ l / YAY-el ) was a general in the Hellriders of Elturel who became trapped in Avernus following Zariel 's failed invasion of the Nine Hells .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Bow, 1354 DR , the rogue angel Zariel enlisted the aid of the Hellriders to mount an assault on Avernus itself in an attempt to end the Blood War between demons and devils . Yael was one of the three Hellrider generals participating in the assault, along with Olanthius and Haruman .</p>
<p>When it became clear the Hellriders had lost the day in a most disastrous fashion, Zariel instead swore her fealty to Asmodeus in exchange for infernal legions she could use to prosecute the Blood War. Upon witnessing this betrayal, Yael and Lulu , Zariel's hollyphant companion, stole the Sword of Zariel and fled, hoping it could be used to redeem the fallen angel one day. Fleeing, Yael and Lulu fought through a horde of demons under the command of Yeenoghu , but were able to escape—barely. The demon lord sent his pet, the horrifying Crokek'toeck , to chase after the pair. Just as Yeenoghu's pet was about to devour them, Yael plunged the Sword of Zariel into a stone while Lulu channeled all the holy power she could muster into it. A mighty fortress sprang into existence around the sword, shielding it from all evil: the Bleeding Citadel . Exhausted from the effort, Lulu fled, leaving Yael behind.</p>
<p>As of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Yael's ghost still guarded the Bleeding Citadel and the Sword of Zariel within.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Yael was considered Zariel's most loyal general. She was well regarded by other Hellriders; Olanthius both respected and secretly adored her.</p>
