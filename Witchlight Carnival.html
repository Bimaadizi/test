<p>The Witchlight Carnival was a planes -faring carnival originating from the Feywild . It was a whimsical fair of dizzying sights and wondrous attractions that visited numerous planets across the Prime Material plane once every eight years.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When packed up and in transit, the Witchlight Carnival was entirely contained within a caravan of wagons, pulled by horses and foxes .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>There was a known fey crossing in the carnival's fairgrounds, which connected it to the domain of Prismeer .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Witchlight Carnival was owned and operated by two shadar-kai named Mister Witch and Mister Light . These entrepreneurs grew up together in Gloomwrought , a city in the Shadowfell , before entering into business together as carnivaleers.</p>
<p>The 124 workers kept the carnival running were known as the Witchlight hands . They operated games and booths, maintained equipment, kept the circus' animals, and acted as ticket-takers, among other activities.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>When the Witchlight Carnival arrived at a world, it would set up outside a large population center. After some time it would move on to another settlement, until it was decided that it relocated to another planet.</p>
<p>The carnival opened just as dusk arrived at a given locale, and continued for a number of hours until the light of the next day.</p>
<h2>Rules and Etiquette</h2>
<p>While there were no written rules for how carnival-goers had to conduct themselves, offensive actions could result in expulsion. Courtesy and good-humor went a long way in endearing an individual to performers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before it was so named, the Witchlight Carnival was originally owned and operated by an eladrin named Isolde . After a night of drinking, Isolde swapped her fey-themed carnival with that run by the two shadar-kai who eventually became Mister Witch and Mister Light.</p>
<p>The Witchlight Carnival was known to have arrived at the town of Daggerford at least twice, over the course of eight years.</p>
