<p>Zstulkk Ssarmn was a yuan-ti abomination who was a slaver of Skullport and one of the founders of the Iron Ring .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Zstulkk Ssarmn's head closely resembled a human , but the rest of his body was that of a large snake with no arms or legs. He wore a magical neckband that made him appear fully human, albeit with a low-sloping forehead and skin that did not quite conceal a pattern of scales.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>In order to appear human, Zstulkk had a magical neckband that altered his appearance. He was also known to wear a brooch of shielding and a ring of protection +2 .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The leaders of the consortium, known as the Lords of Iron, were reluctant partners at best and despised enemies at worst, but worked together enough to make a successful slave trade organization, all the while scheming to take control of the Iron Ring for themselves.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Zstulkk hailed from Hlondeth and became one of the most prominent slavers in Skullport. He realized the limitations of independent slave trade, so, in 1363 DR , he founded—together with fellow slaver and priest of Loviatar , Quinan Varnaed —the Iron Ring consortium. Zstulkk maintained a cadre of yuan-ti purebloods and half-breeds under him.</p>
<p>In Nightal , 1369 DR , Zstulkk Ssarmn threatened another Lord of Iron, Ahmaergo of the Xanathar Thieves' Guild , in front of the general populace and then later that night staged a symbolic attack on Ahmaergo's residence using yuan-ti agents. The purpose of this show of force was unknown, but Ahmaergo responded by changing and reinforcing his defenses and having two yuan-ti publicly murdered in the street.</p>
<p>One of Zstulkk's plots was to construct a secret temple to Sseth and afterward create so many yuan-ti that they could overthrow the city. This temple was completed by 1372 DR beneath his home, and the process of creating new yuan-ti servitors was begun, including the creation of tainted ones .</p>
