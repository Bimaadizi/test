<p>Nall was a veteran mercenary from the Sword Coast North in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nall was a tall and muscular dark-skinned man adorned in a suit of chainmail . His scalp was clean-shaven, and his skin bore weather and scars from his long mercenary career.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the city of Neverwinter survived two short but draining military conflicts in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR and the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the city's Graycloak troops suffered lack of finances, equipment and lack of trainers for its new recruits. A heroic adventurer named Khelgar Ironfist was assigned stewardship of the Crossroad Keep . Desperate for instructors, Khelgar attempted to recruit Nall and his small band of mercenaries when they spent some time at the kelp's only inn â€“ the Phoenix Tail Inn . Nall turned the dwarf down and began getting annoyed by the local militiamen trying to change his mind and train them in war and survival. Nall stated that training militia would never ensure a worthy legacy. A band of heroes, who settled within the Keep alongside merchant princess Sa'Sani , were asked to convince Nall to change his mind; however, the task was accomplished by his female mercenary companion who suggested they all needed a break from constant fighting and maybe Khelgar Ironfist would be able to teach them something in return.</p>
