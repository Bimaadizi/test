<p>Antatlab of the Shaking Stones was the head of the College of Elemental Magic , the College that gathered all wizards with the most exotic specializations, and one of the members of the Conclave of Sshamath in the city of Sshamath in the year 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Rumors said Antatlab was a secret worshiper of Vhaeraun .</p>
<p>In 1379 DR , Antatlab was totally against the proposal by Master Guldor Zauviir to elevate T'lar Mizz'rynturl , Master of Bae'qeshel Magic, as a new member of the Conclave. This was because Antatlab thought the bardic traditions were not true magic.</p>
