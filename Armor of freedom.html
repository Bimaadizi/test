<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first armor of freedom was developed by a warrior- priest Archiel after he survived magical imprisonment. Archiel made a vow to himself never to be restrained by spells. He spent years forging armors of freedom for his own use and his companions. Ironically enough, Archiel's life ended being imprisoned with no magics holding him there, apart from ordinary iron chains.</p>
<p>These armors became more common in the late 14 th century DR , found in several cities across the Sword Coast , Neverwinter , and the Moonsea region.</p>
