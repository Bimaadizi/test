<p>Rundreth Manor was a ruined mansion-house located in the Dessarin Valley , within the Savage Frontier . As of the late 15 th century DR , it was the residence of the shadow dragon Nurvureem , who took the disguise of an enigmatic persona known as "the Dark Lady".</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The manor was situated on a small hill that lay on the east side of the Long Road , which it overlooked. It was less than a day's travel north of Amphail , in the southern part of the Dessarin Valley.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Before its fall to ruin, Rundreth Manor was truly a splendid sight. The stone manse was three floors, with a foundation that resembled a capital-letter "T", top of which pointed eastward. As of the late 15 th century, its roof and several of its walls were collapsed. The manor house's two wings were nearly demolished and covered in overgrowth.</p>
<p>Beneath the mansion was a crypt, within which Nurvureem made her lair. It had a ceiling comprised of a series of vaulted arches, the integrity of which had been compromised by the root-network of the trees that had taken hold above.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Months before the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR , a delegated of representatives from several of the various cults of elemental evil, those being the Black Earth , Crushing Wave , Eternal Flame and the Howling Hatred , paid a visit to Nurvureem within her lair. She slew and devoured most of the cultists, but let a few live so their organization would not bother her again.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Nurvureem lived in the manor alone, under the guise of the drow woman known locally as "the Dark Lady".</p>
