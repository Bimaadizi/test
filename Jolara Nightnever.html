<p>High Moonmistress Jolara Nightnever was a Selûnite priest and the leader of Moonshadow Hall in Yhaunn during the 8 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lost Wayfarers, 757 DR , during her time at Moonshadow Hall, Jolara was informed of the charges laid against the New Moon Pact by High Moonmistress Brima Chintamn of Bright Lady's Tower in nearby Chancelgaunt . Believing that the Pact had indeed fallen to the heresy of believing Shar and Selûne the same being, she supported the charges and condoned the extermination of the Pact.</p>
<p>Unknown to Jolara, the priestess Asha the Silent who arrived later that year was in fact the wolf Halftail, transformed into a human by Selûne in order to protect the legacy of the Pact, and who eventually succeeded Jolara as High Moonmistress.</p>
