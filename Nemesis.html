<p>Nemeses were specialty priests of the Church of Hoar who dedicated their lives to pursuing wrongdoers who escaped justice for the sake of revenge.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Once a target was selected nothing would deter a nemesis from their task. When vengeance was achieved the nemesis was required to contact the original victim of the wrongdoer's offense to inform them that they had been avenged. If the original victim was deceased then the nemesis needed to speak with dead for this to happen. A nemesis could not begin the hunt for another target until these tasks were completed.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>All nemeses, or someone close to them, were wronged at some point during their lives, sparking an obsession deep within that fueled their determination when hunting their targets. Someone could instantly tell that a nemesis was well-traveled just by looking at them. Their stare bore right through people as if they were analyzing their soul.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>When tracking a target a nemesis could perform a night-long prayer vigil which would reveal the cardinal direction where their target was located. A brief vision of the target's surroundings was also revealed. Nemeses were capable of turning undead like normal priests .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>A nemesis was not restricted in the type of armor they could wear nor the kind of weapon they wielded. Regardless of their gear, all nemeses proudly displayed a bronze symbol depicting a two-faced man staring in opposite directions.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Nemeses often worked well with either a scale or hand of Tyr given that their objectives often overlapped. However, the nemesis was not bound by the law and would do whatever was necessary to accomplish their goals.</p>
