<p>Fulgrim Bonebreaker was a durgar thug member of the Night Masks who extorted new arrivals to the city of Westgate in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Fulgrim was a small, brutish, and especially ugly duergar man with red eyes and a clean-shaven head and face. He had a gap-toothed scowl and vicious look about him – the look that said, "I will kill my own grandmother for coin ."</p>
<h2>Posessions</h2>
<p>Fulgrim wore a simple golden ring and carried a potion of sleep as well as a set of thieves' tools . He also owned a copy of Volo's Guide to Magic, Appendix III .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Fulgrim made money by greeting new arrivals in the Harbor Loop as the "Laird o' the Loop" and, with a threatening tone, offered to warn them of the dangers of Westgate. Of course, only if they could pay, and the duergar judged how much to charge them a "fair rate" based on the visitors' equipment. If the new arrivals refused, the duergar moved on to openly threatening them with the cold waters of the harbor unless they paid the tithe. One of that year's arrivals was an adventurer who stepped off the Sea Serpent ship, accompanied by a face familiar to Fulgrim from several winters back. Rinara , once infamous as the Lady of Shivs of Westgate, recognized the duergar's scam. She informed him that Khad , the local criminal who lorded over the Harbor Loop, did not appreciate Night Masks muscling on his turf and that the last one who tried ended up fishing his ears out of the harbor with a jar. Once Fulgrim Bonebreaker recognized Rinara, he backed off and attempted to flee, but was cut down within seconds.</p>
