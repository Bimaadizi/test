<p>The Halls of Demarch was a guildhall in the city of Tantras in the Vast in north Faerûn . It served as headquarters to Demarch's Alliance and later Demarch's Folly .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Halls of Demarch was a secret guildhall, hidden beneath the city of Tantras. It consisted of a subterranean complex and a network of tunnels.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The tunnels of the Halls of Demarch were permanently filled with fog and haunted by shadows , other kinds of undead , and other monsters. These were a byproduct of the Battle of Demarch's Fall .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Halls of Demarch were once home to Demarch's Alliance between beguilers who served Leira and those who served Mask .</p>
<p>But after Mask betrayed Leira in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , the alliance was broken and the two factions fought a massive battle in their former headquarters, the Battle of Demarch's Fall . The rival beguilers fought a number of bloody skirmishes through the tunnels, all concealed in mists. An enormous amount of magic was cast, resulting in the opening of a rift to the Plane of Shadow . Shadows and various other monsters fell out of the rift, along with several magic items and the tome of Suelivain . The Maskarran and Leiran beguilers slaughtered each other.</p>
<p>The survivors fled across Faerûn , living in fear of revenge attacks and church agents seeking to learn or maintain their secrets. A few friendly ex-members, however, returned to the Halls of Demarch, believing the safest place to hide was the last place they were expected. They reformed into a new organization, taking the name Demarch's Folly , and learned shadow magic from the book of Suelivain .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Halls of Demarch were the headquarters of both Demarch's Alliance and Demarch's Folly.</p>
