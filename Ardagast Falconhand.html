<p>Ardagast Falconhand was the commander of the King's Scouts in Cormyr in the early 1200s DR . He was an ancestor of Florin Falconhand of the Knights of Myth Drannor .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ardagast was very tall—about 6.5 ft (2 m), plus or minus—and svelte. He had a prominent aquiline nose, sparkling dark-blue eyes, and light brown hair that turned gray around his temples. His face was weathered from a life spent outdoors.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was a dour man of few words and quiet bearing.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Ardagast was an excellent huntsman, trailblazer, and scout. He rose to the position of leader of the King's Scouts early in the reign of King Dhalmass Obarskyr . He favored a saber in battle and always had a number of throwing knives on his person.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ardagast was one of the witnesses to the heist of what became known as Waevor's Wagon —a well-guarded carriage that was carrying about 60,000 silver pieces for paying the stipends of the Purple Dragons . He was part of an armed escort for a Sembian envoy that was camped for the night when the wagon in question went hurtling past them in the dark, knocking down two of the nobles in the escort. Lord Nelnar Orthwood bid Ardagast to give chase, and the huntsman took a route that brought him within arm's reach of the careening wagon, only to be forced off his horse by a spear thrust from the back window of the vehicle. His armor saved him from being skewered.</p>
