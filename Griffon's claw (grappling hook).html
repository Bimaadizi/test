<p>A griffon's claw was an elaborately designed, magical grappling hook . Its form resembled that of the claw of a raptor .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Upon uttering the claw's command word , it would levitate into the air and fly towards an area denoted by its wielder up to 200 ft (61 m) away. If it latched into a structure, such as a stone ledge or wood on the side of a ship, it was unmovable by non-magical means. The claw would only release its grasp upon a second command word being spoken.</p>
