<p>Visdun Fardara was a fame-seeking adventuring mage , active some years before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Visdun Fardara hailed from the City of Splendors, Waterdeep , raised on stories of great heroes; all Visdun wanted of life was to be sung about in heroic ballads by Waterdhavian bards . He travels all over Faer√ªn attempting to perform grand deeds. He'd managed to do some heroic deeds, but none of them were significant enough to impress minstrels. Visdun resolved to invest in the heroics and spent most of his money to purchase a powerful wand of disintegration in Waterdeep. Visdun traveled to the Graypeaks where a fearsome red dragon named Drazachytus laired. With a single use of the wand , Visdun made the great wyrm collapse on the floor of his laid and turned a pile of sand. The adventuring wizard collected Drazachytus' ashes to prove his heroic deed. Visdun Fardara was praised as a hero in Waterdeep for an entire week until Drazachytus's ashes were stolen from Visdun's strongbox by a rival wizard who wanted to use the remnants of the great red dragon to conduct magical experiments. Without the proof of his dragon slaying, Visdun quickly faded into obscurity.</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the ashes of Drazachytus were in possessions of planeswalker Mintassan , displayed in his curio shop in Westgate 's Market Triangle .</p>
