<p>Olivine Ambergul was a Netherese medusa residing near Daggerford around 1480 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Olivine, totally insane, resided in a special section of her family's crypt crafted for her by her father. She was protected by Malgast , a flesh golem created from the remains of her brothers Kamal and Gaston (as well as a few other nameless donors). The golem was totally under Olivine's command</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Olivine was the daughter of Lord Reynard Ambergul , a Netherese noble who'd become rich robbing tombs and just for fun gathering a small cult to the Elemental Princes of Evil , collecting also some powerful scrolls and artifacts .</p>
<p>After poisoning three husbands in five years in order to gain their money, a curse struck Olivine, transforming her into a medusa. She spent all her fortune and time searching for a cure. At last, her father took pity on her and permitted her to live inside the family crypt where Reynard's grave robbers also put the remains of her dead husbands.</p>
