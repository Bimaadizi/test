<p>Furthinghome was a trading port city in Aglarond and one of the oldest cities in the nation.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Around 1368 DR , it was made up of some buildings in the traditional Aglarondan weathered wood style and others made from stone. It also contained a large slum where the buildings were simple huts. At the city's center was a circular road and a public park called Old Furthing , which acted as a social and financial center.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The port in Furthinghome was small and shallow, which limited the size of vessels that could dock. In 1368 DR, merchants imported spices , textiles, tools, and weapons, and exported fish and a small amount of timber from the Yuirwood , limited in quantity by its half-elf occupants.</p>
<p>The city was also known for its horticulture around the same time, particularly for the dahlias, roses , and orchids grown in the glass greenhouses of the wealthier citizens, but also for herbs too.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The city was ruled in 1374 DR by Lord Fardyl Albin , a member of the Royal Council of Aglarond . He preferred to stay away from the council where possible and concentrate his efforts on the wealthier merchants of Furthinghome.</p>
<h2>Peacocks</h2>
<p>A flock of peacocks were brought to the city from Mulhorand by Lord Ceraut , several decades prior to 1368 DR. After the death of Ceraut, his large estate became abandoned and the peacocks gradually spread to roam freely throughout the countryside surrounding the city.</p>
<h2>Furthingharrow</h2>
<p>The slum district of the city, on the hills of its east side, was known as Furthingharrow. It was a shanty town populated by those settlers who were driven out of the Yuirwood . Most citizens here worked at the docks or as laborers or drivers. The lack of prosperity here was blamed upon a perception that only elves and half-elves could do well. The slums were inclined towards the Sons of Hoar .</p>
