<p>Kelazzan was a coastal city located in the kingdom of Ulgarth in southeast Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Kelazzan had the distinction of being both the westernmost and southernmost settlement of Ulgarth. It bore the brunt of the winter storms off the Great Sea as a result.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Through the mid–14th century DR , Kelazzan was governed by Baron Larid Herokimal , a war hero and paladin . Herokimal was dedicated to law and order and good and fair justice for all. He also felt everyone should enjoy the fruits of their own efforts as far as possible, and no one should be exploited or restricted. His policies kept life in Kelazzan quite pleasant.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>With the kingdom's naval shipyards in Kelazzan, the city was well defended by sea, with up to twenty warships ready to set sail when the need arose. However, its land forces were few—only 500 guardsmen who patrolled the city in twenty troops of 25.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Around 1367 DR , the majority of citizens were traders or farmers working the eastern mingari farms, which provided most of Kelazzan's wealth. Baron Herokimal's policies allowed trade to flourish and the city to prosper.</p>
<p>Kelazzan was also home to the Panglassest shipyards, the largest in the kingdom. These built for the Ulgarthan navy. Despite the town's small size, it had a large port and docks. By 1373 DR , the majority of citizens worked in ship construction and maintenance, with a good number in government work.</p>
<p>There was a certain slaving ring based out of Luskan in far northwest Faerûn , fronted by one Inther Blackfeather , that reached all the way to Kelazzan and neighboring Esbresh .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Kelazzan was a large town of 5000 people, a overwhelming 95% of them human , with demihumans comprising the remainder.</p>
