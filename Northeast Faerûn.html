<p>Northeast Faerûn , referred to in large part as the Demonlands , comprising large portions of the Cold Lands and Unapproachable East , was a remote area of the continent of Faerûn . It began in the cold, forbidding lands along the great ice sheets and continued south toward the northeastern shores of the Sea of Fallen Stars . It was bordered on the west by the mountain-hemmed land of Vaasa and stretched east to the vast steppes of the Hordelands .</p>
<h2>Regions</h2>
<h3>Cold Lands</h3>
<p>These lands comprised the dry, cold, and sparsely-populated regions surrounding the Great Glacier . They were largely insulated from the rest of Faerûn and seldom drew in visitors, save for those folks from nearby nations.</p>
<p>Long at war with one another, the two realms of the Bloodstone Lands united as a single kingdom for many years before being thrown into turmoil once again. It earned its name from the rich veins of ore that ran through the Galena Mountains . [ citation needed ]</p>
<h3>Great Dale</h3>
<p>This coastal land was dominated by the large forests of Rawlinswood to the north and the Forest of Lethyr to the south. The Great Road ran along this gap, starting at the coastal city of Uthmere on the Easting Reach of the Sea of Fallen Stars. This was the most populous area of this land, with only scattered settlements further east. [ citation needed ]</p>
<h3>Unapproachable East</h3>
<h3>Hordelands</h3>
<p>Lying outside Faerûn proper, this vast region of barren steppes stretched far to the east, reaching the distant land of Kara-Tur. It was populated by nomadic horse riders and expert bowmen of the Tuigan people. The region had no permanent settlements, but served as a trade route between Faerûn and Kara-Tur. It earned its nickname as the Endless Wastes from its unbearable climate of frigid winters to unpleasantly hot summers, as well earth that was unsuitable for permanent farming. It used to be part of the kingdom of Raumathar and the present-day Raumviran were believed to descend from the inhabitants of that kingdom.</p>
<h3>Pelvuria</h3>
<p>The northernmost stretch of the region housed lands of Pelvuria, known to most as the Great Glacier. A frozen landscape of tundra, ice, snow, and more ice, was home to fearsome giants , [ citation needed ] dragons , and the Ulutiun peoples.</p>
<h3>Auril's Teeth</h3>
<p>During the 15 th century DR, the snowy and infertile tundra that comprised Pelvuria, Sossal, and the dangerous lands "at the top of the world"—known as the Frostfell —were referred to by some scholars as Auril's Teeth.</p>
