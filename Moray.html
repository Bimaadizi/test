<p>Moray was the westernmost settled island of the Ffolk and the most wild of the southern Moonshae Isles . As of the late 15 th century DR , it was a land torn apart by conflict, and the Black Blood tribe of lycanthropes controlled most of the island.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Moray lay to the south of Norland , west of Gwynneth , and north of Flamsterd . The Trollclaw Range dominated the north while the Orcskull Mountains dominated the south.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The island was one of the first in the Moonshaes to be settled by the Ffolk when they arrived in the 2 nd century DR.</p>
<p>In the mid–14 th century, Elminster Aumar travelled to the isle of Moray. Here, he and King Dagdar of the Kingdom of Moray successfully hunted red deer with a pack of dogs . After this, the two heard the echoing cries of the maiden of Highpeak , and the king told the sage of her legend. During his time here, he also visited Moray-town , and then left on a trader's galleon .</p>
<p>After the Ffolk and Northlanders came together in the United Moonshae Isles in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Northlander raiders turned their attention to the Orcskull Mountains, and their efforts made the island considerably safer than it had been previously. This led to an influx of Ffolk and Northlander settlers. The Northlander fishers largely settled along the north coast while Northlander cowherders settled the upland meadows of the Orcskulls.</p>
<p>Following the rise of the fey realm of Sarifal and during the events of the Spellplague , the humans scoured the island of fey, including elves , and were in turn driven out by the lycanthropes of the Black Blood tribe, who sought to turn the island into a land just for them. The island was abandoned by the humans, and came to be thought of as cursed .</p>
<p>By the late 1470s DR, the northern shore had been resettled by Northlander fishers until the Black Blood tribe, led by an embodiment of Malar , killed the men and forced the women and children into a trap at the Battle of Caer Moray , where the lycanthropes would have slaughtered them all if not for the intervention of Chauntea .</p>
<p>As of 1479 DR , the island was feared as a lycanthrope badland. The countryside was littered with ruined buildings, pillaged villages, and burned farms. At this time, House Kendrick controlled Caer Moray and Dynnegall (which were both under constant threat of attack from the Black Blood tribe), Amn controlled Kork (which was too far from the island's moonwells to attract much attention from the Black Blood), and Northlanders held a few small settlements, notably Farview (which provided timber for the Storm Maiden to build her ships ). During this year, tribes of orcs, ogres , and ettins increased their attacks on the settlements along the coast, and giants became more active in the island's west.</p>
<p>By 1489 DR , the Ffolk inhabitants remained loyal to High King Derid Kendrick , and warred with the Black Blood tribe and other monstrous inhabitants of the isle in hopes of one day securing the island and restoring it as a land of the Ffolk.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Moray was long home to humans who lived alongside halflings . However, they uneasily shared the island with giants in the north and orcs and ogres in the south, not to mention the lycanthropes. The island was also home to shifters , many of whom belonged to the Black Blood tribe.</p>
