<p>Whey-Shu was a famous kenku monk of the Way of the Shadow who was active on the Sword Coast as of the late 15 th century DR . "Whey-Shu" was not her actual name, but rather an approximation of the sound that she called herself: that of a soft slipper sliding across a wood floor.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She had black feathers and dark, reflective eyes. She stood at 4 ft 10 in (150 cm) and weighed 108 lb (49 kg).</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Whey-Shu was calm and serene, even in the face of catastrophe. However, she was very inquisitive, and prone to take risks in pursuit of knowledge. She valued free thinking, quiet planning, and confident action. With her actions, she strove to be both subtle and powerful.</p>
<p>In a fight, Whey-Shu studied her opponent and made a plan to defeat them as swiftly as possible. She cared about winning in the end even if it meant accepting defeat or retreat in the short term.</p>
<p>She preferred foods that did not overwhelm her senses.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Whey-Shu was a shadowdancer . She possessed considerable power through her monastic training, including exceptional control over her ki and the ability to manipulate shadows. She could disappear into the darkness or teleport between shadows, both of which allowed her to disorient her opponents before striking quickly.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Whey-Shu was the youngest child in her family. When she was young, her flock was attacked by goblins , sparking within her a lifelong hatred of such creatures. She and her parents were saved by dwarven monks, and Whey-Shu was offered to the monastery as thanks. She was subsequently raised by the monks.</p>
<p>Because she was unable to communicate easily with the dwarves owing to her kenku mimicry, Whey-Shu became little more than a servant in the dwarven monastery. Aside from cleaning, she also found herself copying sacred texts, which put her in a position to begin teaching herself the Way of the Shadow in secret each night. Her gift for mimicry and her perseverance meant that she had become quite powerful by the time the monks learned of her studies.</p>
<p>She began her adventuring career at the age of 14, having failed to find enlightenment in her seclusion. By this time, she had developed mastery over her ki that rivaled many senior monks, and she was widely regarded as a master of the Way of Shadow despite her youth.</p>
<p>In her travels, Whey-Shu worked as a mercenary and found that it suited her. However, she was known to accept jobs free of charge if they involved fighting goblins. By the late 15 th century DR, her reputation was that of a legendary monk.</p>
<p>It was said that at some point, she travelled to Baldur's Gate and introduced a tea -flavored cookie to the proprietor of the Hissing Stones bathhouse, which would come to be served to patrons.</p>
