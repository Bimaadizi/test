<p>The Citadel of the Purple Dragons was a fortress and home of the Purple Dragons garrison in Suzail , the capital of Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Citadel stood in the southeast corner of Suzail, with its gates facing north, toward the city's jail known as the Lock-Up . It shared the city's massive 80 feet (24 meters) tall walls. The Citadel's walls were equipped with large alarm bells that mobilized the troops in times of strife, and the Harbor Tower rose high dove the water of the Dragonmere on the structure's western wall.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The Citadel of the Purple Dragons was under the command of the Lord Magister of the City. In the late 14 th century DR , Sthavar served as the Lord Magister. Under his control, the garrison of the Purple Dragons was numbered at three hundred patrollers active at a time. Additional barracks were nestled by the city's walls.</p>
<p>The fortress was also home to the Imperial Navy and housed the Royal Docks on the Dragonmere. The docks housed fourteen large vessels, and the Citadel was home to their crew members – over two thousand and five hundred well-trained Blue Dragons . The Crown of Cormyr , a naval palace, was the largest ship as of the late 14 th century DR. The Dragon was Suzail's mightiest warship armed with ballistae and firepot -hurlers. Some of the smaller and swifter ships stationed in the Citadel were the Blade of Espar and the Lance of Wheloon .</p>
