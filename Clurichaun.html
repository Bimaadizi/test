<p>Clurichauns were tiny fey that were related to leprechauns .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Clurichauns resembled 2‑foot-tall (0.61‑meter) elves dressed as innkeepers.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Clurichauns were small fey with a few innate magical powers. They could telekinetically control up to 10 gallons (0.038 cubic meters) of liquid, create wine or water (as with the create water spell), or even make a double out of wine once each day.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Clurichauns were always chaotic creatures, with about half being chaotic neutral , one quarter being chaotic evil , and one quarter being chaotic good . In any case, clurichauns were mean drunks who'd often smash glasses, terrorize pets, and create a mess.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>If forced into melee, clurichauns used tiny daggers . However, they preferred to use their control over liquids to force the liquids to spray out of containers with force similar to that of a decanter of endless water .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Clurichauns lived in the wine cellars of inns and similar places. They ate only wine, regardless of type or vintage, drinking about one bottle a week. They typically did not drink to excess, although some individuals were reported to do so. Clurichauns greatly enjoyed fine wine.</p>
<p>Good clurichauns were known to help out innkeepers by tightening spigots and generally keeping things cleans, while evil clurichauns might drink all of the wine, potentially ruining an innkeeper's business.</p>
<p>Clurichauns did not keep treasure, but typically knew where to find caches of treasure, or at least rumors thereof. When interrogated rather than asked politely, they would fail to mention any guardians of such sites.</p>
