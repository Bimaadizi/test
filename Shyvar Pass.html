<p>Shyvar Pass was a mountain pass across the Tannath Mountains on their eastern side.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The pass lay east of Tannath Mountains , varying its width from 10 miles (16 kilometers) at points to 100 yards (91 meters) at others. It separated Umbergoth and the rest of the Tannath. The pass was not just narrow at points, but high and narrow, full of chokepoints.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The eastern reaches were guarded by the Umber Marshes and the River Umber itself, and to the south lay the Watchwall and Glarondar , making attacks from Thay a risky proposition. Most Aglarondans did not take the threat of invasion from Shyvar Pass seriously, but the pass was still regularly patrolled by horsemen. By 1372 DR , the pass was watched by watchtowers instead. They mostly greeted caravans rather than fight at the time.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of 1202 DR , Thayan forces had attempted to take Aglarond through several routes, including the pass itself several times over the centuries. In 1365 DR , a Thayan force was spotted by Aglarondan griffonriders, while a second Thayan force marched towards Emmech along another route. The Aglarondan forces, after pushing back the force in Shyvar Pass, went around and attacked the second force at Emmech . The Chosen of Mystra Alvaerele Tasundrym and the Red Wizard Selemvarr had a brief fight in the Pass.</p>
