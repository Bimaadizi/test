<p>The fish market of Port Nyanzaru , Chult , was a marketplace where the city's residents shopped for daily meals.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The marketplace was located in the city's Market Ward on the border with the Harbor Ward . It sat between the feet of the Market Ward's two main hills: to the north of Yklwazi Hill and to the southwest of Mount Sibasa .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The market was the premier place to buy daily fresh catches of fish and seafood in Port Nyanzaru. The city's fishing industry specialized in saltwater fish, such as tuna , but also sold some river fish, such as catfish , Esmel perch , and kapenta .</p>
<p>The selection was always better earlier in the day before it was picked over by customers, thus the highest quality (and most expensive) fish were sold in the mornings.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Fish and seafood were dietary staples in Port Nyanzaru, not only because fish was more appetizing than dinosaur , but because fishing was generally safer than hunting in the Chultan jungles. Furthermore, fishing in the Bay of Chult was safer than venturing up the Soshenstar or Tiryki rivers, so saltwater fish were more common at the market.</p>
