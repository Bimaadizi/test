<p>Fetlock Court was a large paved courtyard in the Castle Ward of Waterdeep , adjoining the stables and paddocks of the Lords' Palace .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Officially, it was used as the staging area for mounted guards before their departure on patrols. Unofficially, bards from the New Olamn college often used Fetlock Court as an impromptu concert practice area. It was also possible to purchase horses here.</p>
<p>Benches were available here for public sitting purposes.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Fetlock Court lay directly to the west of Swords Street . A minor street known as the Rise climbed north from the Court and up Mount Waterdeep to the Mountainside neighborhood.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>A flagstone in Fetlock Court concealed a small shaft connected to the Dungeon Level of Undermountain , roughly the diameter of a human arm and equipped with a small container attached to a thin cord of enchanted spidersilk , allowing messages and small items to be passed to and fro. The City Watch were aware of the shaft, but no one could remember exactly which chamber of Undermountain it connected to. In the spring of Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a mysterious individual was spotted using the shaft but they fled when confronted by Watch officers, apparently vanishing into thin air. This drew the attention of Open Lord Laeral Silverhand as well as the Blackstaff , Vajra Safahr . Following this, the City Watch kept the flagstone under active surveillance.</p>
<p>One of the many portals leading to Maldiglas's Refuge deep inside Mount Waterdeep could be found at the southwestern end of Fetlock Court, just past the horse-trough.</p>
