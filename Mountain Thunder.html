<p>Mountain Thunder was an aging dimetrodon who competed in the dinosaur races of Port Nyanzaru in Chult during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the start of the death curse , Mountain Thunder was passed her prime, with bookies giving her only 1:7 odds of winning. Nevertheless, she remained the favorite racer of Alastar Bol , the ranking member of the Order of the Gauntlet in Port Nyanzaru. Even if he was unwilling to attend a race in person due to the heat, he was known to send an underling to place a bet on Mountain Thunder for him. He did this when Mountain Thunder competed in the races at the inaugural Na N'buso's Haka .</p>
