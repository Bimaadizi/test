<p>Zovvuts were a type of non- tanar'ri demon .</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>They were purported to be creations or thralls of Orcus , the demon lord of the undead through blood rituals. However, their obscured origins were really only a mystery for mortal scholars, as it was rumored that any ruler of the Abyss was well-aware of the method used to spawn them. Other sources seemed to believe that Tharizdun , the Chained God, was their progenitor, and that they were in fact once corrupted angels .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Zovvuts were bald and superficially humanoid , with talons similar to a bird of prey and wings resembling their angelic origins. Their most unique features were their three red eyes, two of which were located where a human 's would be and one in the center of the forehead.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>A zovvut's luminescent triple eyes were imbued with vitality-draining magic, and those who looked too long into them risked losing their very lives as the zovvut restored its own. A creature who died from this attack was not safe either, as the zovvut would resurrect its victim as a wight and control the undead creature until either the creature died or the zovvut did.</p>
<p>Additionally, they possessed other spell-like abilities that resemble clairaudience/clairvoyance , darkness , desecrate , detect good , detect thoughts , doom , suggestion , and teleport without error , making them incredibly mobile on the battlefield.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Not as physically strong as other demons but extremely powerful with their innate magical abilities, zovvuts relied on their gaze attack to weaken their foes, then finished them off with quick swipes of their claws or a spiked chain . In addition, their slight physiques disguised the fact that they were frenzied fighters when pressed.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Zovvuts were solitary creatures, but would congregate with wights they had created as their favored form of company. However, some higher demons had recruited zovvuts to be part of their armies as battlefield controllers, though, as former angels, many demons regarded them as pariahs and did not associate with them.</p>
