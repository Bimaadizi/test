<p>Xet was Thormud Horn 's familiar. It resembled a dragonet carved out of opal . It was given away to Kiril Duskmourn in 1374 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Xet resembled a small dragonet made of opal . Its cry was like a chime .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Though it resembled a dragon, it distinctly lacked the courage of one. It was, however, capable of higher reasoning and of concern for its masters, as it showed when it brought Kiril Duskmourn a fur while she was passed out on a street.</p>
<p>At times, it got annoyingly underfoot.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Xet could fly, and it was surprisingly ornery for its size. It often served as an adequate warning system, crying when it noticed something wrong. In a pinch, it could use its sharp claws to make a nuisance of itself. It could also remember paths, and serve as a light source, though it was quite dim for this purpose.</p>
<p>Thormud Horn used the creature to fetch objects, and also as a paperweight.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Xet served as Thormud Horn 's familiar. However, after Tarsakh 19 of 1374 DR , it was eventually gifted to Kiril Duskmourn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Xet was created prior to 1374 DR. It accompanied its master throughout his quest that year, parting with him only when sent to aid Kiril Duskmourn and Prince Monolith in the Palace of the Purple Emperor . While inside the palace, it helped warn the adventurer and the elemental against threats they missed. After their business in the Palace was concluded, Thormud eventually gifted the dragonet to Kiril once she decided to return to Stardeep.</p>
<p>While in the keeping of Kiril, Xet acted occassionally as a caretaker, covering her with a warm fur (of unknown procedence) while she was passed out on the street, reeling in withdrawal from the missing influence of her sword, Angul . The dragonet also served as a warning system for her on occassion, and attacked some of her enemies, to limited effect.</p>
<p>It accompanied the geomancer and Kiril when they headed for Returned Abeir .</p>
