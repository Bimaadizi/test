<p>Ezekial was a henchman, or perhaps pet, to the Talontar blightlord Damanda in 1373 DR . His form was contorted and twisted constantly, drapped in dull dark clothes. When hunting in Dun-Tharos, other demons often got to his prey before he did. While tracking Fallon and Araluen as his mistress bode him, he came across a strange swarm of demons that Fallon had disturbed, and was slain.</p>
