<p>The Trading Post was an unnamed walled caravanserai , a small fortified isle of mercantile activity, located outside of the city of Hillsfar in the Moonsea region.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Trading Post was located a day's ride west of Hillsfar on a small waterway's shores, and about half a day's ride from a local landmark – the Big Tree , south of the caravanserai and about a day from a stone quarry to the north.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the Trading Post was a busy place filled with activity and aromas of exotic gods, roasting food, strong drink, as well as stench of beasts of burden. The wall structure had a sizable market area filled with stalls and at least one inn and stables. In the mid-14 th century DR , the inn was run by a friendly, portly human man who wore a leather apron and a white blouse. The inn offered its guests meals, usually of such dishes as stewed goose , as well as ales and wines .</p>
