<p>Lightning's Folly Wine was a variety of rare wine produced in a tiny winery in Tantras in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Jesperata , an ex- cleric of Talos turned vintner, attended the year-end celebration festival in the town of Mossbridges in the Vast . Jesperata's small wine-making business began very recently circa 1371 DR , and she only brought two bottles to the wine-tasting and rating competition that took place at the festival. Lightning's Folly Wine was a wonderfully tasting drink, possibly the best among the contestants, despite its scant quantity. Jesperata sold a single serving of her wine for a silver piece but limited it to one per person.</p>
