<p>Red sheep were a creature resembling a cross between a goat and a sheep .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Red sheep have very coarse red-brown woolly fur.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Red sheep were rather dull animals. When threatened, they fled to the nearest ledge and once there, remained immobile, believing they were safe. This made them incredibly easy targets for hunters. Even an amateur archer was able to take one down.</p>
<h2>Habitat</h2>
<p>Red sheep were found in great numbers in the Thunder Peaks , on the banks of the Semberflow .</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>The coarse wool of the red sheep was very warm and was almost waterproof. This made it ideal for making thick cloaks and other winter clothing. Red sheep wool blankets were very popular in the markets of Tilverton for their ability to retain heat.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before she became a dracolich , the shadow dragon Aurgloroasa made her lair within the Thunder Peaks around 616Â DR . There she hunted red sheep for her meals.</p>
