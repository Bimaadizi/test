<p>Mereld was one of the War Wizards tapped by the highknight Eskrel Starbridge for his mission to Shadowdale , seeking to apprehend the fugitive Elminster Aumar personally. However, they met a fake Elminster instead: a group of doppelgangers , one of which Mereld was commanded to blast away rather than let it get away. Later, they came across another fake Elminster, this one being actually the noblewoman Storm Silverhand . She deftly outmaneuvered the group and convinced Eskrel Starbridge to hand over a teleport ring ; Mereld questioned why, but didn't push the matter afterwards.</p>
