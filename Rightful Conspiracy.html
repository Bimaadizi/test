<p>The Rightful Conspiracy was an initiative in the early 1370s DR amongst the nobility of Cormyr to overthrow Regent Alusair Obarskyr and assassinate Filfaeril Obarskyr so that a new king could ascend to the throne. It fizzled before the end of the year.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Conspiracy was chaotic and porous, largely lacking in organization, with numerous members working towards different goals and some even trying to murder the others. However, the early spring meeting was held at an island chosen for its defensible position, requiring the crossing of three guard posts and two bridges to reach it. Over time, evidence of backing from Sembia and Amn surfaced.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In early spring of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , a meeting was joined in Marsember , where numerous merchants, local Marsembans, Cormyrean nobles, and even some Red Wizards in disguise got together to discuss a future assassination of the ruling monarchy of Cormyr and its replacement by a different king. The meeting was infiltrated by Elminster , too, and ultimately broke down after a barge full of War Wizards barged into the island, bypassing the defenses entirely. Elminster also attacked some of the Red Wizards, completely halting all activity on the isle.</p>
<p>In the aftermath, the thief Narnra Shalace of Waterdeep was caught in the crossfire after accidentally following Elminster into Marsember, culminating in her being pursued for questioning afterwards. She ultimately was hired by Caladnei to scout out a number of War Wizards who'd met with members of the Conspiracy.</p>
<p>More activity related to the Rightful Conspiracy followed later that year, as evidence of Sembian and Amnian backing was discovered by the War Wizards. The Conspiracy's culmination was to be a massed attack at Thundaerlyn Hall , where a number of nobles would personally attempt to slay Alusair and Filfaeril. Unfortunately for them, the magical backup they were expecting from the Red Wizards was thwarted by the sudden arrival of a flight of dragons , which included Ammaratha Cyndusk and Aeglyl Dreadclaw among others. During the fight, Queen Filfaeril's teleport gem was destroyed by a young scion of the Dracohorn family, preventing their escape. However, thanks to the help of Noumea Cardellith , Filfaeril's Highknights endured long enough for Glarasteer Rhauligan to arrive with reinforcements.</p>
