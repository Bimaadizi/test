<p>Wisdom was a type of giant rune that improved upon the mental abilities of whoever wielded its inscribed object.</p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>Those who wore the inscribed helmet or girdle would be granted a mild improvement to both their intellect and wisdom. The duration of this effect was equal to the caster's level. Upon removal of the runed object this effect would instantly cease.</p>
<h2>Components</h2>
<p>Like most giant runes, it required no material components to cast, though the caster needed to know the giant rune healing . The process of shaping this rune could take anywhere from one to twelve hours. Much like the strength rune, it needed to be inscribed upon either a helmet or girdle.</p>
