<p>Mhulker was a half- illithid wizard in the late 14 th century DR . He was part of a party that explored Undermountain , where he died to Halaster .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He had an illithid's head for some reason.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He referred to something (probably his face) as "my guest". He sounded hurt when people assumed it was taking him over.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Mhulker was delving into Undermountain , accompanied by the Blades: Baergrim , Eltragar , and Mheriyam . He had come for his guest to take a particular woman's brain, promising the others the rest of her when he was done.</p>
<p>He found her in a room with a bead curtain on its archway, with a pedestal on which the large-eyed woman lay spread-eagled and chained. She had runes on her arms, which matched a rune circle on the ground; he rushed, despite Baergrim's warning that her gag was blocking her nose too, and that she couldn't have been breathing enough to struggle that way, or for so long. Before Mhulker could do much, he was incinerated by a trap, half his body going missing and the other half staggering away shortly before dying; the woman revealed herself afterwards to be Halaster in disguise.</p>
