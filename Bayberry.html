<p>Bayberry was a variety of evergreen shrub in the Realms that bore a fruit of the same name.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The berries of this shrub were covered with a waxy coating.</p>
<h2>Usages</h2>
<p>A bushel of bayberries could yield about 4​ to ​5 pounds (1,800​ to ​2,300 grams) of a pleasant-smelling, green wax. This wax could be used to make candles , which were used in the practice of druidic candle magic . During the winter solstice, on the Selûnite holiday of Alban Arthan , many in the city of Ravens Bluff would light such candles during the day and leave them burning until they went out.</p>
