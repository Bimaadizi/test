<p>Feywardens were specialty priests devoted to Corellon Larethian , the Creator of the Elves .</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>All feywardens were elves or half-elves , with the vast majority being moon elves or gold elves . They were highly regarded among elves. A drow could not become a feywarden.</p>
<p>Some feywardens served as warpriests , who served as guardians of the elvish peoples and took a solemn vow to protect and spread their works and traditions. They sought to emulate Corellon by becoming experts not only in combat and conflict, but magic and creativity. They had a sacred duty to refrain from actions that would despoil the natural world, even in war.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Feywardens were completely immune to the paralyzing touch of ghouls and ghasts , and resistant to similar touch attacks from other undead such as lichs . They were also immune to all hold spells and resistant to spider venom and charm effects.</p>
<p>Feywardens could freely channel the divine might of Corellon. In addition to their normal spells , they could cast sixth sense , faerie fire , idea , strength (including a variant that enhanced their dexterity), abjure , minor creation , enchanted weapon , major creation , banishment , prismatic spray , holy word , and sunray once per day. Goblinoids found it particularly difficult to resist spells cast by a feywarden.</p>
<p>The blessings of Corellon granted feywardens the fleetness of wild beasts , the keen senses of the fey , and eldritch connection to the Feywild .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Feywardens did not have restrictions on the type of weapon they were permitted to wield, nor the armor they could wear. All were skilled in the use of the longsword and longbow , and some trained to gracefully swap between these weapons in battle.</p>
