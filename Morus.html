<h2>History</h2>
<p>King Morus ascended to the Golden Throne when his father, King Bellodar III , passed away from natural causes.

He accused his brother Alathos of attempting to seize the crown for his own.</p>
<p>The two brothers fought each other in a wild sword-fight and Alathos was forced to kill his brother. Following the duel, Alathos I ascended as the new king of Impiltur.</p>
