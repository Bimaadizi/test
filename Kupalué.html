<p>Kupalué ( pronounced : / k uː p ɑː ˈ l uː eɪ / koo-pah-LOO-ay ), also known as Kupa or " Weed ", was the vegepygmy companion of the Chultan druid Qawasha in the late 15 th century DR . Kupalué's name meant "walking weed" in the Chultan language .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The vegepygmy stood 3 feet (0.91 meters) tall and weighed about 30 pounds (14 kilograms). If he became wet, the waterlogged vegepygmy gained an additional 20 pounds (9.1 kilograms)</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Kupalué was quite knowledgeable about the many types of animal and plant life that were native to Chult . Left to his own devices, he moved slowly and observantly through the jungle, using the tendrils on his body to feel and taste the air around him, thus allowing him to connect to the jungle more deeply than any human .</p>
<p>He had a sarcastic sense of humor and a fascination with magic . He disdained undead and avoided open spaces like Port Nyanzaru , where the unobstructed sun threatened to dry him out.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Kupalué and Qawasha communicated with one another using their own form of sign language . The name "Kupalué" was given to him by Qawasha, and Kupalué appreciated his companion's effort to give him an identity with which the human could relate (as otherwise, the vegepygmy did not bother to think of himself as an individual rather than part of his collective people). Together, the two of them acted as guides for travelers in the Chultan jungle, and operated out of Fort Beluarian .</p>
<p>Whenever Qawasha returned to his home in Port Nyanzaru, Kupalué returned to his tribe.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kupalué first encountered Qawasha while the latter was meditating by a jungle stream several days journey from Port Nyanzaru. Believing that their encounter was a sign from Ubtao , Qawasha spent several months traveling back and forth from the place where they had met, and slowly they learned to communicate with each other. The two soon began travelling together, with Kupalué teaching Qawasha about the jungle and Qawasha introducing Kupalué to magic.</p>
<p>During the events of the death curse , Qawasha accept a job to guide a researcher named Samrith Vess and her bodyguard, Zara , to the ruins of Mezro . Although Kupalué did not join them at first, he did follow them. When the three of them came under attack by a horde of zombies in Mezro, Kupalué and his tribe intervened, dropping stone walls onto the undead and crushing them. He then joined his friend as the party travelled to the Maze of Life , where Qawasha had a vision of a terrible artifact that was choking the life from the world and preventing the return of Mezro to Chult. As Qawasha, Samrith, and Zara swore to seek out and destroy this artifact, Kupalué offered the aid of his tribe to scout and fight alongside them.</p>
