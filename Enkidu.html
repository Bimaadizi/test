<p>Enkidu was a famed unbeatable warrior from the eastern lands of Kara-Tur , who was active some years before 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Enkidu's battle prowess were said to be unmatched by any. No one was brave enough to challenge the warrior to fair combat, yet many stealthy attacks on Enkidu came from Kara-Turan assassins , ninjas , and wu-jen . Thankfully, a suit of enchanted armor, created specifically for Enkidu, prevented such cowardly attacks from being successful. Enkidu's full plate armor was a famed enough item so many copies and imitations were created by the late 14 th century DR , but none could compete to the original.</p>
