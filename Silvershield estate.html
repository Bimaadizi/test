<p>The Silvershield estate was the family home of the Silvershield patriar family of Baldur's Gate . It was located on the western side of the Upper City 's Manorborn district.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The estate was massive, nearly the size of an entire city block. Despite the grandeur
that overshadowed other Baldurian manors, it offered little in the way of coziness and warmth.</p>
<p>Both the grounds of the estate and the interior of its manor building were decorated by a variety of clockwork devices built by Gondar inventors.</p>
<h3>Grounds</h3>
<p>Perhaps the estate's most distinguished feature was its expansive gardens. It contained a variety of flora, some from as far away as the High Forest and Moonshae Isles . Beyond the herb and vegetable gardens were rows of blueberry bushes, a pear and persimmon orchard, and a small greenhouse full of sable moonflower . There was even a small topiary maze, inhabited by a number of shrub-covered steam dragons in the shape of animals.</p>
<h3>Manor</h3>
<p>In the foyer of the Silvershield home, on its ground floor, was a grand mosaic depicting the family's coat-of-arms over the ship that was depicted on the Baldurian coat. Beyond this anteroom were a number of sitting rooms and a large ballroom complete with a performer's stage. Even further was the west wing of the manor, which housed a spacious feasting hall that easily sat forty individuals.</p>
<p>In the building's spacious basement were the servants' quarters and a full wine cellar.</p>
<p>The upper floors of the manor building held the family's private chambers. Atop the main building was a circular tower containing a smaller dining space, a number of guest rooms, a parlor, the library, and the master bedroom and "main" study. Torlin Silvershield had another, secret study built within the small solarium located on the roof.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The estate was protected by a number of guards stationed at the gate that opened up from the city walls.</p>
