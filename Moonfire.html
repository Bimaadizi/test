<p>Moonfire was a magical substance sacred to the goddess Selûne the Moonmaiden.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Moonfire was formed as a product of certain rituals conducted by the Selûnite clergy . If the goddess was pleased by a ceremony, she bathed the milk or wine (or its combination ) poured on the altar with moonlight, transforming it into moonfire . This strange matter had an opalescent appearance, glowed with a white light, and felt as soft as silk with a consistency like custard. It could move, flowing like a fluid down from the altar.</p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>This mass of moonfire crept away from the altar to touch or envelop whatever or whoever the goddess chose with a variety of results, such as enchanting items, empowering the faithful, and destroying undead .</p>
<p>Some common magical items produced by moonfire were:</p>
<p>as well as various magical shields . On a typical occurrence, magic items worth a total of 5000 to 10,000 gold pieces would be created. Any remaining moonfire fell inert but was still potent and collected by the priests as moonfire salve , with up to six jars . These items were intended for use by the clergy.</p>
<p>In certain circumstances, mortals who were faithful to Selûne and were touched by moonfire would receive a magical power. Some common examples were:</p>
<p>Moonfire would do these things only as Selûne willed it. No-one knew of a way to force it to produce a certain result, those who tried to steal it came away empty-handed, and it disappeared when the goddess desired.</p>
<h2>Beliefs</h2>
<p>The clergy saw moonfire as a holy substance; if stolen, they would go to extraordinary lengths to retrieve it. When moonfire appeared, the clergy considered it a good sign, believing the night was blessed and they were worthy. Those it touched were thought to be marked for a special destiny.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Once, High Initiate Courynna Jacerryl and her followers once performed a "night stalk" ceremony in honor of the goddess, who was pleased and produced moonfire . Courynna called this a blessing, and when it touched Maera's hands, Courynna suggested the goddess had something special planned for her. She directed her followers to gather the sacred substance.</p>
