<p>Pale reavers were bloodthirsty undead spirits that arose from humanoids who had been killed and cursed for betraying people or factions that trusted them.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Their cursed bodies were lightweight and hovered just above the ground. They were semi-corporeal, existing somewhere between solid and insubstantial. More powerful pale reavers could temporarily become completely insubstantial to phase through solid objects.</p>
<p>Pale reavers were known to disguise themselves with illusions to appear as living creatures, and often opted to appear as they did in life. They could mimic normal movement, although they could not perfectly hide their unnatural lightness nor their inherent eeriness. They were distinguished by their mane of long hair, which was white if they had not recently fed on blood but turned red when they did. It stayed red for several hours, and was apparent even when they disguised themselves.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Pale reavers were treacherous and angry. They were jealous of the living, and sought to trick, deceive, and feed on them. Even the weakest pale reavers—known as "creepers"—were intelligent by the standards of undead creatures, and the most powerful among them—known as pale reaver "lords"—were highly cunning and exceled at trickery.</p>
<p>Only the most powerful of pale reavers were able to retain their souls and the memories of their lives before undeath. Weaker pale reavers retained only fragments of their former selves.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>All pale reavers—from the weakest creepers to the mightiest lords—sought to use stealth and guile to gain advantage over their foes. They kept their distance in combat, and would try to pick off injured or poorly armored enemies first. While the weakest (and least intelligent) pale reavers were apt to defensively stalk their prey and attack only when a good opportunity appeared, more powerful (and more intelligent) pale reavers would tempt foes into compromising situations and would delight in misleading and tricking them. They would use their ability to become insubstantial in order to make enemies waste their resources and attacks, or to flee if needed.</p>
<p>When a pale reaver attacked, its long hair stretched out up to 10 feet (3 meters) to strike like vampiric tendrils. When struck, victims were immobilized and the pale reaver would begin to drain their blood through these hairs. Draining blood in this manner restored the pale reaver's strength and turned its hair red. They used the long reach of their hair to keep foes at a distance while healing their own injuries with blood.</p>
<p>Powerful pale reaver lords had the ability to paralyze others with a terrifying shriek, and to dominate with their gaze.</p>
<p>As undead creatures, pale reavers were not susceptible to disease or poison . They were resistant to necrotic energy but harmed by radiant energy .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Pale reavers were predators of living creatures, and would lure them to their doom. A favorite tactic was to use their illusory disguises to entice a victim into a remote location before attacking suddenly.</p>
<p>All but the most powerful pale reavers haunted the places where they had been killed for their crimes, and could not venture more than a few miles from that location. Pale reaver lords, however, could freely travel in search of blood.</p>
<p>Despite their treacherous nature, pale reavers were known to associate with other undead creatures. They often sought to ally with large and physically mighty undead, with lesser pale reaver creepers joining bands of similarly bloodthirsty monsters—like ghouls —while pale reaver lords might form their own organizations or recruit evil creatures—such as poltergeists , skeletons , vampires , wights , and wraiths —to act as guards, soldiers, or servants. Pale reavers could be found among the undead inhabitants of the city of Evernight in the Shadowfell as well as among the undead ranks of Thay during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A pale reaver lord who appeared as a beautiful female elf was part of the Thayan occupation of Undumor in the late 15 th century DR.</p>
<p>When members of the White Petals —a gang that conspired against Clan Neng of Nathlan —were slain in 1479 DR , some arose as pale reaver creepers and continued to follow the commands of their old leader, Mad Fox .</p>
