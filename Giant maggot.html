<p>Giant maggots were the larval stage for several giant insect species.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Giant maggots looked like their smaller cousins. Some giant maggots had several appendages growing from their body, causing them to resemble a hideous caterpillar.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Giant maggots were immune to all mind-affecting effects and spells.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Giant maggots avoided combat, only attacking a creature in self-defense. If a giant maggot was starving, they became predatory and attacked nearby creatures.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Several giant insect species laid their eggs on or near the decaying corpse of a large creature or a large pile of dung, upon which the giant maggots fed. When they hatched, giant maggots were 1 foot (30 centimeters) in length. They continued to grow for several weeks until reaching a maximum length of about 3 ft (91 cm). Shortly after, the giant maggot metamorphosed into an adult giant insect.</p>
