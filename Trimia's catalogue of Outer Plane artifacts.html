<p>Trimia's catalogue of Outer Plane artifacts is an unmarked large book bound in heavy wood. The title of the book and a list of contents can be found on the first page.</p>
<h2>Operation</h2>
<p>On selecting a page, there is a 25% chance it will be blank or 75% chance it will describe a magical device which can provide a way of getting to the appropriate Outer Plane , along with a price from 1,000 to 20,000 gp.</p>
<p>In order to manifest the device in question, the coin must be laid upon the open book page and have a vanish spell cast upon it. The device's command word is the name of the plane of its destination, and it will transport users to a different location on the destination plane each time it is used.</p>
<p>The device can be used up to once per day, and offers the user a return journey from the destination plane to the point of origin on the Prime Material Plane . Each time the device is used, there is a 5% chance it will disappear once it has finished transporting its users to the destination plane.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 1360s DR, a pair of Hellriders of Elturel used a copy of Trimia's catalogue along with a collection of other items with powerful correspondences to open a planar gate and escape the Domains of Dread , after much searching and a confrontation with the vampire Strahd von Zarovich .</p>
