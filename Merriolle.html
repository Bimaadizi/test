<p>Merriolle was an inhabitant of the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Merriolle was a high elven with a pale skin tone, blue eyes, and short, wavy blonde hair.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , during the Absolute crisis , Merriolle found herself among those Baldurians in a crowd who witnessed Bastian d'Zinn , a man of means, accosting the child named Rhaneld for accidentally hitting him with a rock while playing. Bastian believed that a child playing on a street was a sign of the city's crime-ridden downward spiral. Merriolle was outraged that a simple pebble would almost reduce someone to fisticuffs and believed that the Baldur's Mouth Gazette was responsible for riling people up and stoking up hate.</p>
