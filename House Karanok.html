<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Karanoks became the rulers of Luthcheq under suspicious circumstances in the Year of the Quiet Earth, 1161 DR . Initially, they ruled in a typical Chessentan style.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Grimoire, 1324 DR , however, Luthcheq was defeated in a war against Mordulkin and the Karanoks blamed wizard spies for their loss. With this, they started their crusade against arcane magic .</p>
<p>Then, in the Year of the Bloodbird, 1346 DR , from nowhere, Entropy manifested itself inside House Karanok's mansion, killing a wizard they were torturing. The Karanoks saw this as an omen and began worshiping it.</p>
<p>Tiamat started granting clerical powers to the Karanoks in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , in order to manipulate them.</p>
<p>Then everything changed after Tchazzar disappeared in the chaos of the Spellplague in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR . Ishual Karanok emerged as a war hero and leader who united the divided survivors of Luthcheq. He went on to battle rampaging monsters, aberrations sent by the Abolethic Sovereignty , and opportunistic invaders and colonists from northern lands, and so kept Chessenta alive. In the Year of the Fallen Friends, 1399 DR , Ishual Karanok merged the different coinages of the city-states of Chessenta into a single currency. After a time, when the fighting had lessened, he returned to Luthcheq and the Karanok family home. There, Ishual disbanded his family's cult, arguing that their goal of destroying all arcane magic and its users had been achieved with Mystra's death. Nevertheless, he kept their god Entropy as a symbol of power. Even a century after his death, Ishual was revered as a god-like hero by all Chessentans. Children grew up on stories of his exploits and aspired to be like him.</p>
<p>In 1479 DR , the ruler Shala Karanok was ousted from power for a brief time by the returned Tchazzar. However, after the Battle of Luthcheq , she regained control over the city.</p>
