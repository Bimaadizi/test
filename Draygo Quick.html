<h2>History</h2>
<p>Draygo Quick was a noble in the Nethril Empire .</p>
<p>Draygo Quick maintained a home in a compound near Gloomwrought in the Shadowfell where he imprisoned Drizzt Do'Urden for quite some time and petrified Dahlia Sin'felle and Artemis Entreri . The prisoners were rescued when the compound was assaulted by Bregan D'aerthe at the request of Jarlaxle .</p>
<p>Like Parise Ulfbinder, Draygo Quick had an intense interest in the Chosen of the gods . He suspected that Ruqiah / Catti-brie was the Chosen of Mielikki , and for a time he wondered if Drizzt Do'Urden was the Chosen of Lolth , although he later rescinded that idea in favor of Dahlia Sin'felle being favored of Lolth.</p>
