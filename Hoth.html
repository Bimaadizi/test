<p>Hoth of the Six Curses was a mage operating in Murghôm in the mid–13 th century DR . He was named such for the half-dozen curses he was subject to.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Burning Steel, 1246 DR , Hoth was hired to hunt down and kill the hitman who had tried and failed to murder his employer. The hitman was Andaren Robyth , a former thief who'd been partly polymorphed to possess a reptilian left arm. Hoth found Andaren dwelling in a cave outside Phannaskul and intended to kill him, but Andaren bargained for his life by giving Hoth the holy Mielikkian spellbook known as Yornar's Trail Companion . Hoth accepted and settled for teleporting Andaren all the way to Westgate on the Dragon Coast , where he had an eventful, but short, career.</p>
<p>Hoth had taken the Companion hoping it held something that would rid him of at least one of his curses, but nothing in the divine spellbook could help him. Disgusted, he sold it to a merchant in a bazaar in Murghyr . (Later that day, that merchant double-crossed another merchant, who was in fact a doppelganger and member of a druuth serving a mind flayer , and died for his treachery.)</p>
