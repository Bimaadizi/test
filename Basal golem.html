<p>A basal golem was a type of living golem created using a bloodforge . Able to generate magical power and be transformed into a variety of structures and creatures, they formed the bedrock of bloodforge armies in the Utter East . They were often called followers by those who commanded these utterly loyal and unquestioning servants.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Using a bloodforge, a basal golem was formed out of a type of raw magic called " mana ". It appeared in a flash of golden light and a puff of smoke.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Seemingly carved of stone, a basal golem had a muscular and masculine humanoid shape and size, and was bald and with empty eye sockets. Its body color depended on the color of its bloodforge, typically blue or red or some other color (with different hues to better distinguish factions in a battle). Each wore a purplish-gray tunic and loincloth with a yellow belt.</p>
<p>In obelisk form, it was a four-sided steep pyramid of the same height, with a capstone of the same color. The sides were carved with cryptic designs.</p>
<p>In metapod form, it was a cylindrical transparent tank reinforced with metal bars. It was filled with bubbling goo of the same color, in which the golem could be glimpsed, growing like a fetus.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A basal golem that stood idle transformed into an obelisk and meditated. In this state, it generated or gathered mana, which it then transferred back to the bloodforge; it could only do this as an obelisk. Mana was transferred in pulses once a certain amount had been accrued (but less could be transferred early). It turned back into a basal golem when required to move or defend itself.</p>
<p>A basal golem standing upon a friendly bloodforge would be strengthened in attack and defense.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>A basal golem was a very basic foot soldier, attacking only by pummeling foes with its stone fists. In obelisk or metapod forms, it could not move or attack, but was more durable. If threatened, a basal golem would activate (when in obelisk form, but not while held in a metapod) and approach and attack an enemy.</p>
<h2>Transformation</h2>
<p>The primary power of a basal golem was to transform into a wide range of other forms.</p>
<h3>Turret</h3>
<p>The first and most basic transformation was into a "turret". The basal golem turned into a small stone fortification marked with the image of an obelisk. It could not generate mana, but was much more durable. A series of such turrets would link into a defensive wall. A turret could not be reverted into a basal golem.</p>
<h3>Mystical Site</h3>
<p>When four basal golems occupied a special foundation, they could transform it and themselves into a mystical site . This process erected a sacred shrine to a god: for the goddess of nature Chauntea , an Arbor Lodge; for the god of renewal and virtue Lathander , a Temple; for the goddess of magic Mystra , a Runestone; for the god of the dead Myrkul , a Crypt; and for the god of war Tempus , a Barracks.</p>
<h3>Higher-Level Creatures</h3>
<p>When a basal golem came to a friendly mystical site, it could, for an expenditure of mana, transform into a more powerful, higher-level creature. First, it transformed into a metapod, and inside was slowly transformed. If the metapod was destroyed prematurely, the basal golem was slain. When they emerged, they took on a more natural form, often looking completely human or as the creature they mimicked, but with clothing, armor, or body parts displaying their faction's color. However, these did not always closely match the genuine creatures they were based on.</p>
<p>At an Arbor Lodge, a basal golem could be transformed into a creature of the wild. These included:</p>
<p>At a Barracks, a basal golem could be transformed into a hardened warrior. These included:</p>
<p>At a Crypt, a basal golem could be transformed into a creature of evil and dread. These included:</p>
<p>At a Runestone, a basal golem could be transformed into a creature of strong magical essence. These included:</p>
<p>At a Temple, a basal golem could be transformed into a creature of great virtue. These included:</p>
<p>Finally, a golem that had been transformed into a higher-level creature could be reverted back to its basal golem form when beside the bloodforge of its master.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The basal golem and all its higher-level forms was utterly loyal to the bloodforge's owner, acting on their orders without doubt or question. Naturally, they were well trusted by them.</p>
<p>Although they were manufactured golems, they were apparently capable of faith. They meditated to gather mana and were believed to erect the sacred shrines to honor the gods. By paying the gods homage at these shrines, they could transcend their humble forms.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Basal golems were the most basic yet most versatile troops in a bloodforged army.</p>
<p>The Great Mage taught a number of principles of warfare related to the function and philosophy of the bloodforge and its use in battle. His adherents viewed basal golems as "the children of battle". They were commonly called "followers" and even "Acolytes".</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the time of the Bloodforge Wars ( 648 – 657 DR ), basal golems were extensively created and used to fight the wars.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Haunting, 1377 DR , a group of basal golems was summoned via a mysterious wedding gift of magical candles to abduct Eidola of Neverwinter during the wedding ceremony with Piergeiron the Paladinson , the Open Lord of Waterdeep.</p>
