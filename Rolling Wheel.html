<p>While disguised as the peddler "Tarthan", Dove Falconhand determined at a glance that the place was not to her interest because it was not obviously infiltrated by drow . After meeting with the drow infiltrator Sarltan and fighting off his forces, Dove planned on heading there to draw as many witnesses as possible to the corpses of dead drow, in order to draw suspicion and thus hinder any infiltrators' plans for as long as possible.</p>
