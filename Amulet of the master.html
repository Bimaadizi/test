<p>Amulets of the master were enchanted pendants that gave the wearers skills of a master thief .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These amulets granted the wearer abilities on par with a member of a thieves' guild. Once an amulet of the master hung on the owner's neck, they became proficient in disarming traps, opening locks, searching for hidden details and mechanisms, their persuasiveness soared, and they gained knowledge of rare items and magics lore. Additionally, amulets of the master gave the wearer spell resistance.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , a Harper agent Ciressa Gind'ra infiltrated the notorious Night Masks guild of Westgate . Despite being a wizard , Ciressa found a way of giving herself thieving abilities on par with masters of the guild. She created the first amulets of the master . The wizard Harper used the amulet's magics to break into the Night King 's chambers. However, she did not realize that the guildmaster's private guard had permanent detect magic aura cast on the chambers. Ciressa was captured, betrayed by her amulet's bright glow. The Night King tortured her, and her body was left in a puddle in front of her home. Westgate's city watch very convincingly concluded the Harper drowned in a puddle two inches deep on the city street.</p>
<p>Her amulet of the master was taken by the guild and replicated to be sold throughout the Realms to benefit the Night Masks. As of the late 14 th century DR , these amulets could be found in the city of Neverwinter on the Sword Coast North as well as the city of Mulmaster on the Moonsea .</p>
