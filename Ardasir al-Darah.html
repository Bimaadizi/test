Ardasir wore dark robes typical of the al-Badia with the hopes of appearing as a large human or ogre at a distance.</p>

The vision showed him as Amir of all jann of the Haunted Lands , ruling from an elegant throne adorned with peacocks . Spirits within the desert informed him this was the legendary Peacock Throne of Moradask . The throne was known to have been separated into 15 pieces, and Ardasir only believed he would become Amir after fully reassembling the throne. He had but a single piece as of 1367 DR.</p>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The shiekh's favorite concubine was a tasked artist genie named Safia . Ardasir's uncle was Amir Heidar Qan , the ruler of the jann of the Haunted Lands. Since Heidar disappeared decades ago, Ardasir began amassing favors among the other sheiks of the jann with the plan to assume outright rule over them.</p>
