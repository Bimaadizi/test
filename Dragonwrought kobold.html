<p>Dragonwrought kobolds were rare members of the kobold race with a stronger connection to their draconic ancestors.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>All dragonwrought kobolds had scales that were tinted in a hue that aligned with the draconic color of their respective ancestors. Some but not all of these kobolds had a functional set of reptilian wings, which would appear and increase in functionality as the dragonwrought kobold aged.</p>
<p>Mottles of the dragon ancestor's color coated dragonwrought eggs, with the spots increasing in size and number over time.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Dragonwrought kobolds tended to be naturally skilled at different things depending on their type of draconic ancestor. For example, those of red dragon ancestry were talented at appraising treasure, while those of gold dragon ancestry were better at treating injuries and those of silver dragon ancestry were better at disguising themselves. The most common shared affinity was for stealthiness (shared by those of black , blue , copper , green , and white dragon heritage).</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The influence of a dragonwrought kobold's ancestry was deep enough that they were granted several abilities usually possessed solely by true dragons . They were immune to sleep- and paralysis-inducing magic, and they lived much longer than normal kobolds, with those having metallic dragon ancestry often outliving those with chromatic ancestry. In addition, they suffered no physical degradation as a result of age.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>A dragonwrought kobold was considered a blessing by normal kobolds, being both a sign of their heritage and a powerful boon for their race as a whole. When a dragonwrought egg was discovered amongst a kobold tribe, special accommodations had to be made. Whether by making pilgrimage to a special location, or already having access to such an area, dragonwrought kobolds had to be raised in environments that allowed them to properly fly, often aboveground where normal kobolds rarely ventured otherwise. Even though not all dragonwrought kobolds could soar, the possibility was important enough that a trek would be made if need be.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kobold myths maintained that the race was descended from true dragons. One of the strongest pieces of evidence for this claim was the rare hatching of a dragonwrought kobold. In ancient times, dragons had interbred with kobolds to produce offspring that could keep the kobolds in check.</p>
