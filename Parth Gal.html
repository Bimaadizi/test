<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Parth and his reconnaissance patrol accompanied the Vaasan warrior Vala Thorsdotter on mission within the depths of the Irithlium in ruined Myth Drannor . Nearly half of Parth's squad were killed before encountering a single phaerimm .</p>
<p>After Vala went ahead of the Shadovar, and single-handedly killed a phaerimm without their aid, Parth and the rest of his scouts fell cone-shaped darts that shout out of the walls beneath the ruined elven tower.</p>
