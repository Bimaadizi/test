<p>Graskynar ( pronounced : /ˈ g r ɑː z ˈ k ɪ n n ɑːr / Graz-KIN-nar ) was an isolationist realm of dwarves in northeast Faerûn . It was home to the Graskeld clan of dwarves.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>The Graskyn dwarves were highly isolationist but not hostile to outsiders, being rather contented and self-sufficient. Young, restless dwarves were encouraged to "see the Realms " and spend their energy with wandering and adventure, which resulted in few returning.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The realm lay deep below the Giantspire Mountains , near Narfell . It lay within a string of deep Underdark caverns that included pure, freshwater lakes.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>As of the 15 th century DR , the Graskyn farmed their freshwater lakes that they had carefully stocked with fish, harvesting them along with native scuttle- crabs and blind eels . They carefully protected the lakes from natural predators and intelligent water-dwellers, ensuring the security of their food supply. They also mined and worked some iron that they traded with the nearby Nar .</p>
