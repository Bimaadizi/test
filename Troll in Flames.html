<p>The Troll in Flames was the only inn in the hamlet of Mornbryn's Shield . It was run by a gruff gnome named Flanagus Gnarlybone . The Troll had a one-item menu, for tiny rooms, but offered a selection of alcohol circa 1365 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Technically, the Troll in Flames was a tavern that mainly served alcohol, but it did offer limited lodgings. The small inn rented four of its tiny rooms on a nightly basis. The rooms in the Troll were truly small and could at best fit three people per room with one of them having to sleep on the floorboards.</p>
<p>The Troll in Flames' name came from the local color, that of constant danger looming in the Evermoors. The troll raids were quite common, and the locals could always appreciate a troll in flames, such as the tavern's signboard that hung above the main doorsâ€”a laughing troll's head covered in flames.</p>
<p>The innkeeper Gnarlybone was known to order and save certain wines and ales especially for regular customers he knew to expect.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>When adventurers or merchants found themselves in the Troll in Flames overnight, they were happy to know that the price of 2 sp they paid included a flagon of ale and a basket of spread bread made with abundant local river fish called silverlings . Spread bread was the only food item served at the Troll in Flames.</p>
<p>The main business here came from the drinks. The tavern carried a small selection of good ales and wines . The alcohol was sold by the pitcher for ales and by the bottle for wines. The most expensive alcohols available were usually zzar , Saerloonian Glowfire , and evershimmer .</p>
