<p>The Librarian was a consciousness that inhabited an enormous statue in the gem -encrusted Hall of Living Memory in Myth Nantar .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Librarian manifested as a statue of three elves performing daily tasks: reading, praying, and writing upon a scroll . It was situated in a domed chamber, the walls of which were lined with kiira . As the Librarian spoke to visitors, the eyes of the three elves in the statue shone and triggered similar flickering in the surrounding kiira .</p>
<p>It was in fact the transmuted remains of three ancient elven sages that lived during the time of ancient Aryselmalyr .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The Librarian was rather cryptic in its interactions with others. It could only be spoken to when in the presence of people of elven lineage.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>If any entity touched the Librarian's surface, it would take from them their memories, likely causing some form of feeblemindedness . When this occurred, one of the Librarian's three faces would grow a new kiira upon its forehead and release it into the surrounding chamber.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Library served as a repository of ancient elven knowledge. While it sometimes revealed secrets to those that sought audience, this was often a rather perplexing affair.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time during or around the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Red Wizards from the land of Thay sought out the Librarian in its home city. They were followed by Zehira Deryan and her fellow adventurers .</p>
<p>Zehira and her companions were able to hold audience with the Librarian, and their ally Thessalia .</p>
