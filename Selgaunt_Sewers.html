<p>The sewers of Selgaunt were a sanitation system of tunnels beneath the eponymous Sembian port city.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The sewage throughout the system coursed northeast, emptying out into Selgaunt Bay through rusty grates beneath its wharves, occasionally broken up by heaps of refuse where the sewage eddied and swirled around. The sewers could be quite warm, especially during the winter months.</p>
<p>The ceilings of the tunnels were vaulted. In some areas they were high enough for a human to walk properly across its cobblestone walkways, while in other parts of the sewers the ceiling was low, requiring humans and similarly tall creatures to crouch or crawl to navigate through them during periods of low tide.</p>
<p>While some areas of the sewers sported ensconced lamps that let off an eerie green glow, most were dark, requiring one to carry a source of light, such as a candle or lantern . The sewers were also permeated by a rank odor of waste, organic decay, dung , and goldflow , as was typical of sewer systems.</p>
<h3>Sewer Ecology</h3>
<p>In addition to standard sewer wildlife such as rats and giant rats , tales abounded in Selgaunt of dire creatures lurking within its sewers. These included such things as ghouls , flesh dissolving slimes , and algoids .</p>

<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>It was not uncommon to find Selgauntian beggars and destitute to take shelter in the warmth of the sewers, occasionally perishing therein and becoming food for the local rats.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Despite the existence of the sewer system, Selgauntians continued to pour their waste out in chamberpots for collection by nightsoil wagons well into the late 14 th century DR.</p>
<p>Around Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , thieves Erevis Cale and Jak Fleet fled down the secret entrance off of Stevedore's Way to escape from Zhent agents that were after them. Erevis was suspicious of Jak's knowledge of how to access the secret entrance, but before they could come to blows they ran into Jak's fellow agents and he was forced to reveal to Erevis that he was a member of the Harpers. The two friends managed to reconcile and continue their travel through the sewers.</p>
<p>Larajin , a half-elf servant of the Uskevren family, often snuck into the Hunting Gardens of Hulorn whenever she needed to clear her head. But one night when she was planning to go, in the winter of 1370 DR, the dwarf Kremlar offered her thirty ravens if she could retrieve a rare flower by the name of Selune's Kisses . She would manage to access the Hunting Gardens with ease, but while there discovered an injured tressym and Andeth Ilchammar , the Hulorn of Selgaunt, whose body had been transformed by dark magics. Fearful of being caught, Larajin waited until he was out of sight before fleeing from the scene and vowing to return the next morning for the tressym.</p>
<p>The next night she returned with Talbot Uskevren , who had insisted upon accompanying her after hearing her recount. However, the two never made it to the Hunting Gardens of Hulorn that night, as stumbled upon a swarm of rats that had been transformed by the Hulorn's foul magics. Their bodies sported a menagerie of different mutations, from beaks, serpent tongues, human-like hands, hooves, feathered wings, horns, and even a tiny human head in one case. The two ran feverishly through the dark sewage as the ravenous swarm pursued them, grasping at them, gnawing at their clothes. With luck, the two managed to escape from the depths.</p>
<p>A year later around Deepwinter , Erevis Cale came across a pile of rotting corpses at the base of the ladder leading up into the Night Knives guildhouse. Numbering around fifteen to twenty, the entangled mass of corpses were being feasted upon by giant rats. It took Cale little time to recognize the corpses as all members of the Night Knives, murdered by the demons that had taken over the thieves' guild .</p>
<p>By Uktar 11 , in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , unrest across Sembia left the possibility of a civil war looming as a certainty over the new Hulorn of Selgaunt, Thamalon Uskevren II . Wanting to prepare his city against the army of Countess Mirabeta Selkirk , Thamalon had engineers supervise wide-scale renovations of the city's defenses, which included securing Selgaunt's sewer grates.</p>
