<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Wizards Guild of Ravens Bluff was founded some time before Charles Oliver O'Kane became Lord Mayor in 1341 DR . Several lords of the Fire River lands depleted their private armies and began recruiting spellcasters. This escalated, continuing until Lord Carlton De Sheers gathered enough spellcasters to form an entire company of battlemages. Rival lords responded in kind, hiring their own war-wizards. Two priests, Sir Gregory Cherbourg of Mystra and Lord Anthony Norwood of the temple of Azuth, became alarmed at the potential devastation if all the war-wizards were to unleash their power at once. They secretly gathered all the lords' battlemages to a private meeting and made an impassioned plea, convincing many of the wizards to abandon the pursuit of greed while the rest were asked to go elsewhere. The remaining mages joined a mutual non-aggression pact, which eventually began to evolve into working partnerships and friendships, in the early days of the guild. It since became a social outlet for the members, a shared repository of knowledge, and a place to learn and practice magic.</p>
