<p>Blaskar Toldovar was an old slaver operating out of Scornubel until the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As of 1369Â DR , Blaskar walked with a cane. He was balding, with a notably raspy voice, and had recently taken to wearing a monocle.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Though he'd grown rather paranoid and jumpy by 1369 DR, none less than Dove Falconhand counted him as a reliably gentle, giving person, despite the fact he was a slaver, because of his practice of sending the cold, the cruel, and the killers to malevolent masters and making sure the gentler victims of his trade were treated more gently. She thought him leery still, but even in that, counted him gentle. While in contact with him, probably employing some mind-reaming method, Dove also mentioned he'd grown less superficial over time, finally marrying a good woman in his old age. He was also tired of living in fear by that year, and hadn't really laughed in years.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Blaskar lived in a manor with a tall stone-wall, its top covered in bottle-shards; the garden boasted at least one moss-girt stone statue. Despite its value, the house was quite dusty.</p>
<p>He wielded a cane adapted to fire a mageslaying dart , and kept a row of identical canes in his study.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Blaskar Toldovar was a slaver. By 1369, he'd rather dissociated from the trade, pushed out by younger, rowdier slavers.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He had two dogs, and employed at least that many guards. He was acquainted with Dove Falconhand , who'd grown fond of him somehow.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point, Blaskar Toldovar branded and sold Dove Falconhand, who at the time he took to be a young girl. She had since returned to check up on him a dozen times prior to 1369 DR, using disguises. He'd later confirm to Dove that he'd slain a woman he intended to marry after she'd turned out to be a drow infiltrator that had most likely killed and replaced the original. He'd also admit to twenty-three "matches", implied to be inducements to other merchants to engage in slavery.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Dove disguised herself as an old woman and entered his home by giving the right password to the door guard. Meeting with him, she found him paranoid and jumpy, but got him at ease by manacling herself and revealing her brand to him. She then inquired with him regarding drow infiltrators, casting a spell to shield them from detection and another to determine whether he was telling the truth.</p>
<p>Blaskar offered to give up all his information regarding the drow in exchange for being spell-sent to Neverwinter , as Dove offered. Come morning, he was gone from the manor, permanently.</p>
