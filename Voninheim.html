<p>Voninheim , (which means " Titanhome " in Jotun , ) known also as the Bleak Palace , was a citadel in the Ice Spires .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was built by Lanaxis and formed the capital of the giant kingdom of Ostoria for over a thousand years. When Ulutiu died and his amulet began to freeze the northernmost part of Faer√ªn , Voninheim was placed under threat by the advancing ice, but Othea , Lanaxis's mother, forbade him from intervening. Lanaxis attempted to defy Othea, but Voninheim was destroyed by the ice.</p>
