<p>Imrul Athelzedar was the Magister from 1328 DR to 1354 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was wise, and sensitive to what others needed.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He was offered the mantle of the Magister by Azuth even though he was less powerful than many other wizards, because he was more hard-working than most. As the Magister, he studied the state of Faerûn more than many of his predecessors; he took to moving much, aiding, fighting, and dropping magic for others to find endlessly. He even took part in helping nurture and arrange marriages covertly for the clans that his predecessor had been working on. He eventually chose to sacrifice himself so as to be able to choose his successor as the Magister: this choice was eventually Nouméa Drathchuld .</p>
<p>Imrul Athelzedar offered to become a shadowstaff if Mystra were to accept Nouméa as the next magister. The goddess took him up on it on 1347 DR ; for the next few years, Imrul trained Nouméa, until in 1354 DR , mortally wounded by Eron Imgrym of Sheirtalar , a challenger, Imrul asked Nouméa to strike him down. She did so, and acquired the office of the Magister.</p>
