<p>Tasina Alcrest was a priestess of Umberlee on the Sword Coast .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , soon after the end of the Wailing Death quarantine and the conclusion of the Neverwinter - Luskan war, Tasina made arrangements to travel aboard Midnight Rose , departing from the gang-ridden Docks District of Neverwinter. During her last days in the Jewel of the North, Tasina stayed at the Golden Apple in the docks. When it was time to depart, Captain Allendry sent members of his crew: Nisar Zayid and Eater-of-Garm . However, trouble found her first. A group of thugs who were claiming to be Allendry's men were escorted to the priestess' chambers by Gilda , Apple's older maid. The criminals were mercenaries hired by Tasina to guard her on the trip to Neverwinter and beyond. However, she had no coin , and the men were ready for violence. Eater-of-Garm and Nisar arrived just in time to save the priestess and escort her to the Rose and her true goal.</p>
<p>She boarded the Midnight Rose as a passenger in order to stay close to a wizard who possessed a powerful statue artifact from the hot sands of Anauroch desired by Umberlee. When the ship was on the high seas, in order to acquire the strange artifact, Tasina summoned an army of sahuagin that slaughtered most of the crew and took the ship.</p>
<p>She then ventured into the mysterious sea-region of Fiddler's Green . There, Tasina planned to go to a submerged temple to her goddess and summon her in all her power. However, an adventurer, also a passenger of the Midnight Rose , went in search of Tasina, having promised vengeance to the ghost of Allendry , the ship's captain. At last, the adventurer defeated Tasina.</p>
