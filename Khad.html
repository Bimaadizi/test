<p>Khad was a criminal who claimed the Harbor Loop of Westgate as his territory in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Fulgrim Bonebreaker made money by greeting new arrivals in the Harbor Loop as the "Laird o' the Loop" and, with a threatening tone, offered to warn them of the dangers of Westgate. Of course, only if they could pay, and the duergar judged how much to charge them a "fair rate" based on the visitors' equipment. This Protection racket was an opportunistic grab for coin by Fulgrim, without Khad's knowledge nor approval. Khad was surely to act quickly, punishing the duergar member of the Night Masks were he ever made aware of Fulgrim's scam. However, that never happened as the duergar was promptly murdered by Rinara , once infamous as the Lady of Shivs.</p>
