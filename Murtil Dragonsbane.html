<p>Murtil Dragonsbane was the King of Bloodstone in the mid-to-late 15 th century DR , and the last of the Dragonsbane dynasty.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He likely ruled from the assassination of Brianne Dragonsbane in the Year of the Forged Sigil, 1459 DR until the Year of the Elven Swords Returned, 1465 DR , when he died as a childless bachelor. Many believed that Yarin Frostmantle murdered him in order to become king, and indeed Murtil had been killed by Yarin's favorite hitman, Rafer Ingot .</p>
<p>Murtil's reign saw the beginning of the end of the unified Kingdom of Bloodstone when the Warlock Knights of Vaasa rebelled in the Year of the Malachite Shadows, 1460 DR .</p>
