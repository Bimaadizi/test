<p>The metapsionics discipline was a theoretical advanced discipline of psionics that primarily revolved around enhancing, augmenting, or amplifying other psionic powers or abilities. All of its powers fell under the purview of the other psionic disciplines, such as cannibalize , empower , and psychic surgery . Some referred to it as, rather than a discipline, its own unique subset of psionic abilities that augmented psionic powers, such as doubling their effective range, splitting a ray-attack into two, or making a power manifest twice. With the right skills in creating psionic items , one could store a metapsionic power within a dorje , power stone , or psionic tattoo .</p>
