<p>Obould was an orc chieftain during the 12 th century DR , and later the self-proclaimed first king of the Citadel of Many Arrows .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Obould was bald and huge, said to have been as tall as two normal orcs (leading to speculation of some giant in his ancestry). He was remarkably resistant to poisons , which helped him to fend off challenges for his position.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was said to be shrewd and bloodthirsty.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Obould ruled the orcs of the Citadel of Many Arrows, but also pledged allegiance to the orcish kings of the Ice Mountains who had sponsored his original conquest of the Citadel. He maintained alliances with evil human mages and Underdark mind flayers , but because this risked the ire of his shamans , he also deferred to their spiritual guidance in order to prove his devotion to the Orc pantheon .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Dark Dawn, 1104 DR , Obould assembled a massive hoard of orcs within Dead Orc Pass with the aid of the orcs of the Ice Mountains. He marched this huge army to the walls of Citadel Felbarr , and in the course of a four-month bloody siege that came to be called the Battle of Many Arrows , he seized control of the Citadel from its Silvaeren defenders.</p>
<p>Following the victory, his orcs moved into the Citadel, renaming it as the Citadel of Many Arrows. After much additional bloodshed, he asserted his right to declare himself king of the Many Arrows orcs . His bloodline would continue to rule the Citadel until the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , when the contemporary king—who would come to be known as the great King Obould Many-Arrows —lost it in battle.</p>
