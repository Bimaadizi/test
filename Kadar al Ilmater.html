<p>Kadar al Ilmater was a Calishite human monk of Ilmater , a member of the Order of St. Uzurr , the Abbot of the Cloister of St. Uzurr , and leader of the city of Uzurr in Lapaliiya circa 1373 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime circa 1370 DR , Kadar learned of the cruel process by which yuan-ti transformed humans into tainted ones and broodguards . Seeing a terrible suffering, he focused on finding a means to undo the process and restore victims to full humanity. Though still unsuccessful, a spy for the yuan-ti House Eselemas operating within his Order reported that he was nearing a solution.</p>
<p>In response, yuan-ti purebloods began infiltrating Uzurr on Eleasias 1 , the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , with the aim of assassinating Kadar.</p>
