<p>Lord Chess was the ineffectual overlord of Zhentil Keep from at least the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR until his death around the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Chess was a gluttonous, corpulent man who was vainly fastidious in manner and dress. A coward at heart, he was prone to gossip and being self-important.</p>
<p>He did have a fine taste for wine however and particularly enjoyed a fine vintage from Mulhorand .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Chess started training as a cleric , switched to studying magic , then gave that up to be trained in the martial arts. He did not attain mastery of any of these professions.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>As another means to protect his hide, Chess wore a magical ring that could apparently summon a dragon to his aid upon request.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Chess was highly untrusting of Manshoon and his secretive Zhentarim , fearing his close connection with the church of Bane via Fzoul Chembryl , as well as his association with aberrant beholders .</p>
<p>Over time, the Zhentarim kept Chess in his position of overlord of the Keep because he was easy to manipulate and provided diplomatic cover for their operations. The enemies of the Zhents didn't want him to be removed for fear of someone actually competent taking his place and expanding the Zhent influence. Being cowardly and fearful of attack or assassination, he hired a small squad of five bodyguards to accompany him whenever necessary.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Blazing Brand, 1334 DR , Chess demonstrated uncharacteristic bravery when he openly spoke against a vote that would grant First Lord Manshoon complete military power of Zhentil Keep during a meeting of the Council of Lords at High Hall . The meeting was derailed when a terrific battle broke out between Chess' summoned dragon and Manshoon's beholders. The vote appeared to turn in Manshoon's favor when the elder orb Arglath emerged as the victor. The tables were turned when Arglath (who was actually the mage Elminster in disguise) threatened Manshoon to stop his schemes and abuse of magic. After the vote turned against Manshoon, Lord Chess was named "Watchlord" and given special directorship over the Council of Lords.</p>
<p>When the avatar of Bane arrived on Faerûn during the Time of Troubles in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Lord Chess became the ostensible but ultimately powerless ruler of Zhentil Keep. Bane however held the true power at the city's Black Altar , directing Chess to carry out his will for the "good" of the Zhent citizens. When Bane's avatar was seemingly destroyed during the second battle of Shadowdale , Chess loyalists cried out that he should be made ruler of Zhentil Keep in earnest. Chess' political ideals quickly put down when Bane returned to Zhentil Keep in the body of his most loyal priest and chosen , Fzoul Chembryl.</p>
<p>Lord Chess was double-crossed by Mask during his bid to trap Kezef the Chaos Hound, which resulted in Chess' death.</p>
<p>Chess' estate was located in the north section of Zhentil Keep's Inner Quarter .</p>
