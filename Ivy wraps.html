<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The handwraps were made of strips of heavy leather and tied with knotted thorny vines. The viciously spiked vines seemed to brighten and gain vitality when they tasted blood.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The handwraps were found in the Druid's Deep of Thorngap when adventurers pursued the insane druid Halsaime . They were in the possession of the bog hag Aghilde , who lurked nearby.</p>
