<p>The ruby blushrose was a flowering plant that grew within the Rose Garden in the Battle of Bones and other areas of Toril .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The flower of this plant was bright red, larger than other roses, and lacked thorns. The ruby blushrose gave off a pleasing aroma that made most humans blush when they smelled it but was actually an airborne poison.</p>
<h2>Use</h2>
<p>This flower was used in perfumes by inhabitants of Kara-Tur . Prolonged exposure to the aromas was believed to cause debilitating exhaustion and light-headedness, which some romantics simply attributed to falling in love. It was suspected that the disorientation one experienced within the Rose Garden was partly caused by this plant.</p>
