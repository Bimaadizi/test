<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1491 DR , following the attacks by the white dragon Cryovain in the surrounding region, Linene Greywind hired Velleen Firecrow as her new assistant and courier for the Lionshield Coster trading post in Phandalin. Velleen and her crew of kobolds were secretly spies for the evil Cult of Talos.</p>
<p>When the Shrine of Luck in town was left unattended for some time, Velleen used the opportunity to ransack it. She also befriended Thistle , a clerc working at Barthen's Provisions , and unsuccessfully attempted to convert him to the Cult of Talos.</p>
<p>At some point, a group of adventurers from Leilon , who had previously thwarted the plans of the Talos followers, arrived in Phandalin to pick up supplies for Leilon. Before they could leave town, Velleen and her kobolds confronted them. At the same time, Argus Skeel , a spy for the rivaling Cult of Myrkul , confronted the adventurers with his ghouls , resulting in a three-sided battle.</p>
