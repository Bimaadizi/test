<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Life</h3>
<p>Born a nobleman of Petathal , Viledel was a seaman and adventurer .</p>
<p>He arrived in the Korinn Archipelago in the early 13 th century DR at the head of fleets of colonists with aspirations of establishing a maritime empire. The islands at the time were sparsely populated and home to a large number of pirates, and Viledel began a campaign of stamping out these pirates, starting by establishing his base on an island in the middle of their activities. By the Year of the Tattered Banners, 1228 DR , he had established himself as the "Sea King" and his followers were quickly expanding across the islands, integrating peacefully with local farmers and fishers while further diminishing the power of the pirates.</p>
<p>At some point, he married Liala. His son, Horedel, died from disease in the twentieth year of this reign, and Viledel gave him an extravagant burial.</p>
<p>Viledel ruled for four decades, assimilating the archipelago under his sway, creating trade routes, and establishing himself as the most powerful person on the islands. His reign ended when the remaining pirates retaliated, and he was slain in a great assault that overwhelmed his island's defenses and wiped out its population.</p>
<h3>Unlife</h3>
<p>The bodies of Viledel and his queen were interred in the catacombs beneath his manor by Keestake—one of the sole survivors of the massacre —who laid Viledel's body upon a stone slab, carved an epitaph in his honor, and babbled a number of desperate prayers over his fallen king. Unbeknownst to Keestake, Viledel was wearing a ring of wishes , which responded to the prayers by transforming both Viledel and his queen into undead creatures akin to zombies that did not rot or deteriorate. The pair of them laid patiently in this state, ready to slay any who dared to rob their crypt.</p>
<h3>Legacy</h3>
<p>Following Viledel's death, the political unity of his subjects fractured, and while his colonies continued to thrive on their own islands, they did so to a lesser degree than if they had continued to be united under his empire. The pirates soon regained their foothold in the islands, and were so thorough in their retaliation against Viledel that knowledge of his home island's location was functionally erased over the following six decades.</p>
<p>More than two centuries after his death, Hergatha "the Storm Maiden" of Norland claimed to possess Viledel's reincarnated spirit . While she believed this to be true and the reason for her many blessings, she was mistaken.</p>
