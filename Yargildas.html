<p>Yargildas of Altumbel was an adventurer of the mid-14 th century DR.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to his death on 1356 DR , Yargildas had reported on the interconnected underground chambers beneath the Barrowlands , the magical, impenetrable darkness within, and though he found no sign of fiends or undead , he had found rune circles that he suspected were portals.</p>
<p>Yargildas had been known to have Adriyana's Garter as of 1356 DR in Impiltur , where he used it to walk up to a wizard and cut them down in spite of their spells. Other adventurers later found his possessions soaked with blood in pedestals on a tor in the desolate wilderlands north of Impiltur , with each pedestal bearing a chalked symbol; a circular spot devoid of blood in one empty pedestal suggested that Adriyana's Garter had been placed there.</p>
