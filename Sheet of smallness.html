<p>Sheets of smallness were enchanted items that could drastically reduce objects in size and return them to their original state. These magic items could be found as far south as the markets of Zakhara .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sheets of smallness appeared as mundane pieces of cloth or similar material. The most often encountered sheets were made out of linen , silk , or even paper , on occasion. These items could resemble simple covering sheets, or a crumpled sheet of paper. However, all sheets of smallness had two distinctly patterned or colored sides. One was flat and undecorated while the other had a pattern or a solid black color. These sheets emanated alteration magics.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Sheets of smallness had several uses. Any item, whether mundane, magical, or even a powerful artifact , when wrapped in the correct side of one of these sheets reduced in size to one-twelfth of the original size and weight. To return the reduced item to its original size, it needed to be unwrapped and touched to the sheet's other side. Items that were reduced in size became virtually unusable, and the size change process took around two minutes. Sheets of smallness could only affect non-living things.</p>
