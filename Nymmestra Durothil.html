<p>Nymmestra Durothil , or Nym , was a gold elf born of House Durothil of Evermeet . She enjoyed a successful career as an adventurer and agent of the Harpers , having played a critical role in the effort to prevent the Cult of the Dragon from taking control over the Sword Coast in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Nymmestra had a mischievous and a wild side that got her into a great deal of trouble. She was able to overcome these destructive tendencies, only after being banished from her home in Evermeet and stripped of her magic in Silverymoon .</p>
<p>She found pleasure and joy in making others angry, if only to break down the barriers that may put up.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Her affinity for magic led her to study at the Towers of the Sun and Moon .</p>
<p>On some occasions, Nymmestra would recall powerful magical spells that she knew earlier in life. Unfortunately this phenomena lasted for only a brief while and she quickly forgot them once again.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nymmestra Durothil hailed from a life of privilege and power, but had little respect for how she had got there. An embarrassment to her family, Nym was someone who only partied and got into fights, inadvertently making enemies for her house through crude actions.</p>
<p>The final straw came after she seriously hurt another elf in a mage's duel. She had chosen to visit the city of Taltempla on Evermeet. She became roaring drunk on evermead and challenged three other wizards to a duel, all at the same time. Although drunk, Nym beat them all soundly, seriously injuring one of them almost to the point of death. The leaders of Evermeet banished Nym to the Sword Coast for this act of uncaring harm she had inflicted.</p>
<p>Nym made her way to Silverymoon, where she acted in the same unruly manner she had at home. She was arrested for her activities, and brought before Lord Taern "Thunderspell" Hornblade , who was ruler of Silverymoon at that time.</p>
<p>Realizing she was a Durothil, Thunderspell did not banish her or physically harm her out of respect for her lineage. He did however take something from her. By attaching a pair of magical bracers to her wrists, he erased all memory of her magical studies. Initially angered, Nym was humbled by this experience, and began to search for a way to restore her lost knowledge. After months of searching, she could find no way to undo her curse, and realized she must start her studies again from scratch. This led her to dedicate herself to her studies. With her new work ethic, she began to look at the world in a different light seeking out friendship and offering it as well. In her turning over a new leaf, she came to the attention of the High Harpers of Silverymoon, and was asked to become an agent of the Harpers.</p>
<h3>Tyranny of Dragons</h3>
<p>Later in the 1480s DR, Nymmestra joined the coalition to stop the Cult of the Dragon from summoning Tiamat to the Material Plane . She and two other adventurers, Alaeros Margaster and Barrowin Undurr , traveled from Neverwinter to Icewind Dale to fight stop the Cult from acquiring more power for their Dragon Queen. There, they joined forces with Halander Hardingdale and Talon Everhale . Their adventures took them to the Flame Fault on Tuern , to the city of Waterdeep , and finally to the Well of Dragons in the Backlands of the west.</p>
<p>It was there that Nymmestra and her companions, along with the powerful factions whom they each represented, fought in a great and terrible battle against the cult's forces. In the end, they managed to apprehend the cult's leader Severin Silrajin , and earn a fair amount of renown for their respective groups in the eyes of the people of Faer√ªn .</p>
