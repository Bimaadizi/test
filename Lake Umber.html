<p>Lake Umber was a freshwater lake at the base of Thayan First Escarpment between Thay and Aglarond .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The river plummeted from the escarpment and widened, shaping the slow-moving narrow lake. From there, it flowed through the Lower Falls and formed the main wider body of Lake Umber.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Lake Umber was a part of the River Umber , which began in the mountain glaciers of Thaymount and ended in the Umber Marshes , feeding Aglarond's farms.</p>
<p>The area surrounding the lake was sparsely populated. It was claimed by both Thay and Aglarond, and only a few fishermen families lived on its banks.</p>
<h2>Flora & Fauna</h2>
<p>The shores of Lake Umber were fertile enough to support small fishing and farming industries. The most common trees that grew on its banks were oaks, birches, and willows.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>The main body of the lake had two vulnerable and unwalled trading towns sitting on its north and south shores: Nethentir and Nethjet , respectively. Most of the locals were simple fishermen with a few farms scattered in the area producing food for the residents of the two towns but not for export.</p>
<p>The tharchion of the Thaymount controlled the length of the River Umber, including Lake Umber and both towns of Nethentir and Nethjet.</p>
