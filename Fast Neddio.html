<p>Fast Neddio was a lustful inhabitant of the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Neddio had sun-kissed skin, brown eyes, and a clean-shaven face and head. His clothes betrayed him as a man of means and his hat – as a man of poor taste.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Fast Neddio could often be found in the Lower City, not far from the Blushing Mermaid with the hin fiend named Theda Grosz . Together, they spent their days productively – drooling and lusting over passing Flaming Fist mercenary patrols. Neddio, by his own admission, could not resist a man in uniform or any other man in general.</p>
