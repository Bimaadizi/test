<p>An angel of decay , also called a rot harbinger , was an undead monstrosity powered by decay, a mockery of true angels .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Angels of decay resembled the celestial outsiders more by happenstance rather than design, with a vaguely humanoid form and wings. They stood about 9 ft (2.7 m) tall and weighed approximately 500‒700 lb (230‒320 kg). Their bodies were constantly rotting and streaming off liquid corruption.</p>
<p>When they spoke they did so with a slurred, muddy voice.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>When angels of decay stood upon the ground, the liquid corruption that they shed formed a pool around them up to 15 ft (4.6 m) in radius; this pool caused living creatures that touched to begin to decay themselves. Additionally, when angels of decay attacked with their claws and wings, their very touch caused injuries to rot.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Rot harbingers generally preferred to fight in melee because of their decay-inducing touch, although some were known to throw balls of necrotizing material at enemies.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>When healthy creatures rotted and liquified in death, some indefinable essence drifted away, and the decomposing flesh radiated an energy that angels of decay "fed" upon.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Angels of decay were created after a legion of angels tried to slay the demon lord Orcus while he was traveling outside of the Abyss . However, Orcus slew every last one of them instead and, when he returned to the Abyss, created the first rot harbingers as a mockery of the angels and sent them into the natural world to wreak havoc.</p>
<p>On occasions, the goddess Shar managed to corrupt some Shards of Selûne , transforming them into angels of decay to do her bidding.</p>
<h2>Notable Angels of Decay</h2>
<p>An angel of decay named Shex was a field commander for an army of undead.</p>
