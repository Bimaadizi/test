<p>Elissa Tarixon was the mysterious Queen who ruled the amazon isle of Ixinos off the coast of the Vilhon Reach in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Elissa ruled her island of reclusive amazon warriors circa the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR . However, her total reign length was a mystery, like so many other things about Ixinos. The port city of Tazixor was the only known settlement under Queen Elissa's control, and during her rule, the island did not allow visitors and did not participate in diplomatic relations with any other nations of the Vilhon Reach.</p>
