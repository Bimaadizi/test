<p>Aurelia was a vampire spawn and one of the favorite "children" of the vampire lord Cazador Szarr , who resided in the Szarr Palace of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Aurelia was a female tiefling with crimson skin and black straight horns. Her eyes glowed with the typical sinister red color of a vampire's gaze. Like her "siblings," Aurelia's back was carved with infernal runes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Like her "siblings," the purpose of Aurelia's existence was a powerful ritual to be performed by Cazador Szarr in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . As a result, the vampire spawns were to be destroyed, and their power would transform Cazador into a vampire ascendant . Aurelia believed that that ritual would instead let all of Cazador's "children" cheat death. Under her master's orders, Aurelia, alongside Violet , Yousen , and Leon Onufrio attempted to retrieve Astarion Ancun√≠n , after he and the Absolute Adversaries reached the city of Baldur's Gate. All of Cazador's spawn were needed for the ritual to succeed; however, it was unknown if the Black Mass was successful and if Aurelia was destroyed, or if the Black Mass never was completed, leaving Aurelia freed from her dark master, or if she was slain in the process by the Absolute Adversaries and Astarion.</p>
