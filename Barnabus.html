<p>Barnabus was the name given to a gnoll archer who was mentally enslaved by a follower of the Absolute in the Moonrise Towers during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Shortly before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , three gnolls had their will dominated by a True Soul cultist of a new fledgling religionâ€” the Absolute . Linsella used her psionics , granted her via being infected by an illithid tadpole, to enslave and re-train the gnolls as her servants and cooks in the Moonrise Towers, which were the cult's base. She renamed her slave gnolls to Barnabus, Timothy , and Tomelia . Linsella claimed that she'd quelled the gnolls' savage nature and showed them a "gentler way." Barnabus was instructed to cook soups, yet bloodthirstiness and rage still seethed underneath the painful mental domination.</p>
<p>When the gnolls and their mistress encountered a group of the True Soul heroes of Baldur's Gate they may had been helped by severing Linsella's mental leash, leading to the cultist's swift death. Some said that the heroes could've dominated the gnolls themselves, while by other accounts, the three gnolls could've remained under the cult's control and perished in an assault by Harpers and the True Soul heroes on the Moonrise Towers.</p>
