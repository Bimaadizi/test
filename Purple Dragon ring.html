<p>A purple dragon ring was a brass ring inscribed with the purple dragon symbol of the Obarskyr royal family of Cormyr , and they were usually worn by the Purple Dragons to protect the royal family from harm. In 1372 DR , it was reported that over 4,000 of these rings had been made.</p>
<p>An individual had to be wearing such a ring to enter an area protected by a ring ward .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The ring had the ability to produce magical light in a 10‑foot (3‑meter) sphere up to 40 ft (12 m) away. This light source lasted ten minutes and could not be turned off except by dispelling of some sort.</p>
<p>The ring could also be activated to detect poison in gases, liquids, and solids that it came into contact with. It glowed a golden-green color if poison was present.</p>
<p>While activated, it would also glow bright blue if placed in contact with anything carrying a magical enchantment.</p>
<p>If this ring was worn on the same hand as a commander's ring , they were treated as wearing only one ring.</p>
