<p>Andras was a Weavespinner in the mid-14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Andras was present in the aftermath of High Lady Alustriel 's fight against the Weave-wraiths from Jethaere during the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , at the same time that Shandril Shessair was on a caravan headed for Waterdeep . He assisted Alustriel in the aftermath, learning the Weave-wraiths were riding her, with her consent, and that she was binding them. Attending to her during a bath, after handing her rosefire tea , he was told that Mystra had forbid the outright destruction of the Weave-wraiths so long as they moved not against mages, took away anyone's free will, or damaged wards. He also learned that Alustriel planned to call on the help of Shandril's spellfire to better bind them later, but that she also believed it may be necessary to summon Elminster and Khelben to destroy them if she faltered before that was possible. To his horror, she suggested smashing the Altar of Mystra to draw their attention if they didn't pay attention to spell-callings.</p>
