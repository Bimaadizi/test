<p>Manfred "Manny" Arbustle was a druid member of the Company of Eight in Tethyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>With noticeable freckles, Manfred appeared very boyish and younger than his actual age. He had sandy-colored hair and blue eyes. He dressed in olive-green or brown hooded robes, which he wore over leather.</p>
<p>Most people called him Manny , but he hated that nickname.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Manfred had a strong love of nature. The forest and all of its wonders gave him comfort in times of stress.</p>
<p>Manfred wanted to prove his valor to his fellow companions. He was insecure in his status as the youngest member of the Company and feared that others saw him as a child. For this Manfred sometimes acted sullen or rebellious.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Manfred was proficient in the use of the quarterstaff and sling . He was a good horse rider and knew much about animals and plants.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Manfred carried no magical items, his main "weapon" being an uncured sapling that he used as a staff. He wore leather armor and carried throwing daggers and a sling.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was very close to his master, Arkaneus Silvermane , and also respected Sylvanus Moondrop , with whom he became good friends. He had a bad relationship only with the Calishite mage Lawantha Silendia , because his parents taught him to not trust foreigners, especially Calishites, because his father once was captured by pirates and sold into slavery in Calimshan . He also found her arrogant and was jealous of her knowledge of the plant life of Tethyr, which was complicated by the fact that he found her extremely attractive.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Manfred became a druid because of his love of nature. He trained under Arkaneus Silvermane and, in 1357 DR , replaced the retiring elven mage/ thief Mirthal Aendryr in the Company at the suggestion of his master.</p>
<p>After the rise of the new queen of Tethyr, when Silvanus Moondrop was appointed as Count of Uluran , the elf requested that his friend Manfred be assigned to remain with him at his official county seat of Uluran Keep , along with fellow Company member Paddy Stoutfellow . Secretly, Silvanus wanted to re-band the Company of Eight to ensure that the new kingdom was being justly run, and he wanted Manfred to help in this.</p>
