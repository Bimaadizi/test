<p>Qholillaroon was an ulitharid who plotted to seize control of the Heartcoil Deeps in the Northdark and, from there, to destroy Waterdeep in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Qholillaroon had an alien ruthlessness and efficiency, and sought to twist anything its advantage.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Simply being near Qholillaroon induced incredible psychic pressure in the minds of humanoids that reverberated in their skulls like a chant of its name. In combat, the powerful ulitharid used its mighty psychic power to great effect, striking with telekinetic stabs, whips, and bursts as well as assaulting its enemies' senses to alter their perceptions of the battlefield. Its favored confusion tactics included appearing to duplicate itself and turning its foes against each other.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Qholillaroon aspired to establish a mind flayer city in the Heartcoil Deeps with itself as a presiding elder brain . From there, its ultimate goal was to destroy Waterdeep, although its reasons for this were unclear.</p>
<p>During the enacting of this plan, Qholillaroon spent much of its time in a brackish pool deep within its newly established colony, which its mind flayer minions were diligently shaping around. Qholillaroon was able to monitor the colony through crystal formations, from which it could also gauge the strength of any intruders. In addition, Qholillaroon dispatched cranium rats far and wide to serve as its spies, with many of these finding their way into Waterdeep.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Qholillaroon had some sort of agreement or alliance with the pit fiend Kurgaloth , and through him, with the Lightfinger family of Waterdeep, who worked to distract the city from Qholillaroon's rise as part of their infernal contract with Kurgaloth.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, Qholillaroon led its mind flayer minions to the Heartcoil Deeps to establish a colony, with the eventual plan being to establish a city. The mind flayers began by transforming the stones themselves to render the area glowing and uninhabitable, thus driving out the local stone giants and all but the most dangerous monsters. They diligently erased all signs of the Deeps' previous inhabitants, and managed to manipulate the natural hostility of the remaining monsters—like otyughs —to serve as guardians. They eventually molded the stones into an unsettling alien geometry pocked with crystals that assailed the minds of intruders.</p>
<p>During this scheme, they were shielded from being discovered by the betrayal of the Lightfinger family, who ensured that the city of Waterdeep was blind to their activity. However, the chaos caused by expelling the stone giants did not go unnoticed, and soon Open Lord Laeral Silverhand sent a group of adventurers to investigate the Heartcoil Deeps. These heroes not only discovered Qholillaroon's plot, but successfully thwarted its efforts to become an elder brain before slaying it.</p>
