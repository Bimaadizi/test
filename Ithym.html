<p>Ithym was a thief with the Brave Blades in the 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was a little sarcastic, which seemed to be common in the band.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Brave Blades' delve into Ondil's Tower , Ithym found at least one secret door. Later, during a battle against a trap that held a red dragon , beholder , and a mind flayer in abeyance, Ithym helped fling projectiles into the beholder. He also helped explore the area beyond the trap, a circular room with no end of balconies on its sides, though he realized soon that all of the balconies, including the one they came from, led into the same room.</p>
<p>After they made their way into the lich's chamber, Gralkyn smashed one of the windows; in response, a force squeezed him and Ithym out of it, and hurled them into the ground, where they died.</p>
