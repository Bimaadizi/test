<p>Byuchyuch was a goblin slave of House Do'Urden in the drow city of Menzoberranzan .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Byuchyuch became an "indentured servant" to House Do'Urden circa 1307 DR .</p>
<p>In or around 1317 DR , he was summoned by Maya and Malice Do'Urden to play a part in their plan to force Drizzt Do'Urden to shed blood before entering Melee-Magthere , the drow fighters' academy. Malice magically turned Byuchyuch's appearance into that of a drow and Maya presented him as her champion, challenging Drizzt to a fight. Drizzt easily overcame the poor fighter. While Byuchyuch was helpless, Drizzt was magically compelled by Malice to kill him. Doing so made Byuchyuch the first being Drizzt had killed.</p>
