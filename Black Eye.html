<p>The Black Eye was a tavern in Westgate that offered a good view of the city docks, the Market Triangle , and the Tower at its center, all visible from its patio.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Black Eye was located in the center of the city on Silverpiece Way , right off the Harbor Loop .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The food at the Black Eye was not very good and cheap with most of the clientele were dockhands or whores.</p>
<p>The Black Eye was staffed with massive bouncers who were ready to break any of the fifths that were common at the tavern. Those who started trouble were tossed into the harbor, "feeding the quelzarn ." Two bouncers who guarded the tavern circa 1374 were Gregory â€“ a giant of a man who loomed over any one customer, and Marv , who was smaller than Gregory but was still an intimidatingly "big man." Both were the tavern's co-owners and brothers of Little Davey , the man who ran the establishment. At that time, the Black Eye had one hired dancer named Dimples . Little Davey allowed brawls, as long as the fighters cleaned up after themselves and did not use shivs or blades.</p>
<p>The tavern did not offer lodgings but had a selection of alcohol that included locally made Brother Tobias' 1368 , imported Night Masks' Nightmare , as well as ale , stout , hard liquor, and wine . Despite the establishment being a tavern without any rental rooms, Little Davey allowed customers to just plunk themselves in the corner of the taproom along with other drunkards sleeping the revelry off.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The tavern and festhall was still open into the late 15 th century DR .</p>
