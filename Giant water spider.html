In particular, giant water spiders were known to occasionally be found in the lakes of Cormanthor , the neighboring Moonsea region's lake of the same name , the River Ashaba , Dragon Reach , and the Marsh of Chelimber . Beneath the cold plains and Galena Mountains of the Vaasa region, they inhabited an Underdark cavern sacred to Kiaransalee known as the Vault of Gnashing Teeth .</p>
