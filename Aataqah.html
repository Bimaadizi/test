<p>Aataqah was a djinni captured by the cruel mage named Jon Irenicus circa 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Aataqah was captured sometime before the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR and kept in Jon Irenicus's dungeon and laboratory deep underneath the city of Athkatla in Amn . Abdel Adrian and his companions were captured by Irenicus, but with help from Imoen , the Bhaalspawn 's sister, the surviving group escaped the imprisonment. As they were searching for a way out, Aataqah appeared in front of the Bhaalspawn in the dungeon's crystal-filled Scrying Chamber and declared that Abdel's thread of life was bright and frayed. The djinni was uninterested in capturing the escapees for his master, but he was overcome by curiosity about the faithful man. Aataqah posed a single hypothetical question trying to determine the Bhaalspawn's morality. Aataqah's actions were dependent on Abdel's answer. If the man answered nobly, the djinni was ready to summon an ogre mage to attack the escapees, while a cowardly response could lead Aataqah to conjure a pack of mad gibberlings . In either case, the djinni was going to offer Abdel a hint of how to escape. Aataqah had no interest in aiding the Bhaalspawn without being given a response.</p>
