<p>Doegan (pronounced durgan ) was a realm in the Utter East of southeast Faerûn . It was one of the Five Kingdoms of the Utter East.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It lay south of the Free Cities of Parsanic and west of the country of Edenvale . The coastal area of Doegan was known as the Doegan Shores. The land around the Capital was open and clear, with pleasant green fields and palm trees, but harsh times saw it become dry and rocky, or as rippled brown earth like dried mud with patches of broken, rougher land. Marshes lay in the northwest.</p>
<p>The climate was hot and muggy, and even a horse would grow weary here.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Howl of Vengeance</h3>
<p>During the time of the Bloodforge Wars ( 648 – 657 DR ), invaders led by Rathgar the Raider overran Doegan and laid siege to the capital . To pacify his own poor clansmen, Rathgar plundered the realm of its bounty. Finally, he came for the crown itself, and confronted the king and princess in their own throne room. However, with his dying breath, the defiant king cursed him, declaring "For so long as you rule, a curse upon you. The dead will arise, to ensure your demise."</p>
<p>Escaping the invaders, the princess looked for a way to make her father's prophecy come true. She went to Old Stone Keep and there met Aelric , a mage of Doegan who was heir to a great magical legacy. Uninterested in wealth or fame, he vowed to aid her and, furthermore, fulfill her father's curse to take vengeance on those who'd occupied his homeland.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, months passed and Rathgar paid no heed to the curse, until a captured criminal, a graverobber called Grubkern , whispered of a gathering army of undead coming to rid Doegan of the invaders. As fear spread in the capital, Rathgar determined to investigate, threatening to kill Grubkern if he'd spoken falsely.</p>
<p>The Howl of Vengeance conflict was fought between the two factions using bloodforges .</p>
<h3>During the Legendary Campaign</h3>
<p>Formerly a powerful nation, Doegan fell into decline under the rule of Patric Fulgirth , an idle ruler who cared not for the needs of the people. The leader of the Legendary Campaign sought to depose Fulgirth, and thought this would be an easy task.</p>
<p>Later, the cunning mage Gim Blacktongue used treachery to usurp the throne of Doegan. Although the kingdom prospered, it did so under an air of suspicion, and Doegan folk called for a new and trustworthy rule. The leader of the Legendary Campaign came to Doegan and attempted to remove Blacktongue from power.</p>
<p>Eventually, Doegan fell into the safe hands of Hariah Highkin . The capital prospered, the borders held firm, and people were happy. Nevertheless, on a quest to unify the wartorn Utter East through conquest, the leader of the Legendary Campaign returned and tried to conquer Doegan, no matter the cost to the realm.</p>
<h3>Modern history</h3>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Queen Rosalind of Edenvale ordered Atreus Eleint and Yago expelled from her kingdom, with an honor guard to escort them to the Doegan Shores and put on the first ship to the Sword Coast . However, they escaped before that could occur.</p>
<p>Also in 1368 DR, delegates of Doegan and Konigheim met in Tharkar under the pretense of negotiating a treaty. However, both sides planned to sabotage the proceedings by murdering one of their own, so as to unite the rest of the Kingdoms against the other. Their plots were foiled by an agent from Ulgarth , and there was no overall change in the political structure of the Five Kingdoms.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Emperor Aetheric III abducted Eidola Boareskyr , the bride-to-be of Waterdeep 's Open Lord Piergeiron Paladinson in an attempt to summon a foreign army to defeat the demons that plagued Doegan due to use of the bloodforge. The plan failed, and Eldrinpar was sacked by a horde of monsters. The mad mutated emperor, Aetheric III, was almost assassinated by Artemis Entreri , then finished off by the band of paladins sent by Waterdeep. Chancellor Ikavi Garkim became the new ruler of Doegan and declared Mar and Ffolk to be full equals. By the end of the events, to ensure the bloodforge was used responsibly, Garkim shared the position of Emperor with the Chosen of Tyr, Ingrar Welven, and they cast the monsters out of the city.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>In the 7th century DR , Doegan was ruled by a succession of monarchs.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
