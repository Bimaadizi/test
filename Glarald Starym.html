<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to 241 DR, Glarald Starym took an enchantment from Felaern Starym 's tomb and adapted it to control a number of minds from a distance. He used that magic to control Alais Dree and two unicorns , then using sorcery to alter Alais Dree's body shape to better suit his tastes.</p>
<p>In 241 DR , Glarald Starym was approached by the Srinshee as a possible herald of Cormanthyr . However, while he accepted, his mind was read as part of the process; when he learned of something they'd discovered, he attacked the Srinshee and Earynspieir . Amongst other things, he used Alais Dree and two unicorns as weapons through forbidden magic. After the Srinshee broke his thrall, they turned on him. He barely survived, and was kept afterwards at Thurdan's Tree , wounded in his wits.</p>
