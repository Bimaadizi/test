<p>Lorien Dawnbringer was a priestess of Sune in Waterdeep . She was a very good friend of Ilira Nathalan and the two were rumored to be lovers although it's doubtful they had a physical relationship because Ilira's spellscar prevented her from touching another person. Lorien spent time skulking around Downshadow , healing adventurers who had taken on more than they could handle.</p>
<p>In 1479 DR in an attempt to gain a measure of revenge on Ilira, Beshaba's high priest , Lilten , had Lorien killed by one of his minions, the dwarf Rath .</p>
