<p>Nimreth Aragodar was a researcher mage , member of the Arcane Brotherhood , and the creator of enchanted enduring vestments .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Nimreth Aragodar performed magical experiments on living creatures. One such experiment involved a mountain lion that broke out of control and almost killed the wizard. In order to better protect herself from such accidents, Nimreth weaved physical and spell protections into robes she cared enduring vestments . Ironically enough, her new robes did not protect Nimreth from an angry summoned water elemental who filled the woman's lungs with water.</p>
