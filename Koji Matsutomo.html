<p>Koji Matsutomo was a head of the Matsutomo clan and a daimyo of Aru Province in Wa in the mid-1600s on the Wa Calendar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Wa Year 1640 (1222 DR) , the shogun returned Aru Province to the Matsutomo clan, appointing Koji Matsutomo as daimyo. A weak man, Koji was liked by peasants but hated by rival nobles who'd moved to Aru. He survived two attempted coups in Wa Year 1645 (1227 DR) and Wa Year 1649 (1231 DR) , and thereafter focused only on protecting himself and his clan.</p>
<p>As a result, he neglected the province's administration and corruption got out of control. When in Wa Year 1652 (1234 DR) the annual shipment of tax payments at Uwaji was 30% less than reported on the manifest, Koji and the Matsutomos were removed, with the province passed to the Kubahachi clan.</p>
