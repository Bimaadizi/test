<p>Porcupines were a nocturnal mammal that lived in many forests.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They were between 2 feet (0.61 meters) and 3 feet (0.91 meters) long, with thick muscular tails, and a back covered in spines. The black porcupines tended to be on the larger side, while the brown was on the smaller. Their quills had overlapping barbs at the end which made them difficult to remove and often caused painful swelling even after disposal.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Being very timid and prone to panic, they were relatively non-aggressive unless threatened.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>When attacked, porcupines would swipe with their tails, dislodging quills into their opponents and then attempt a retreat away from their attackers.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>As they were herbivores, porcupines fed on the bark and leaves of trees, while fruits and salt were delicacies for them.</p>
<h3>Habitat</h3>
<p>They were noted to live in many places in Faerûn , from the great Cormanthor forest, to the Tun Marshes , and many a settled land.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Porcupines were sometimes used by brambles as mounts .</p>
