<p>Prayer Alley was a dead-end alleyway and courtyard in the Sea Ward of Waterdeep and the only street access to the area known as Ravencourt .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The entrance to Prayer Alley was at the eastern end of Aureenar Street on the southeast side, one door before Aureenar ended at Trollkill Street . The intrepid explorer Volothamp Geddarm described Prayer Alley as going around the central buildings of the block and ending up parallel to Phastal Street , but earlier maps show it running parallel to Aureenar Street. In either case, the alley ended in the southwest corner of the courtyard near the only tree on the block, the infamous Hanging Tree of Ravencourt .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prayer Alley got its name from a time when the area was much more dangerous, and unfortunate victims of thievery had no prayer of escaping the dead-end alleyway.</p>
