His nose was flat and crooked and his face was marked by small and uneven patches of hair. Olgerkhan was not very tall, somewhere between 5.5 and 6 feet (1.7 to 1.8 meters). He appeared much larger though, for his limbs and chest were thick and strong.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Olgerkhan almost died defending Arrayan from being killed by Athrogate and Canthan Doolittle . He was saved by Artemis Entreri through the vampiric powers of Artemis' dagger, consuming the life-force of Canthan and giving it to Olgerkhan.</p>
