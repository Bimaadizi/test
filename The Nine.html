<p>The Nine was a powerful, long-lasting band of adventurers that wandered the Realms for over thirty winters, formerly led by Laeral Silverhand .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Circa 1300-1330 DR</h3>
<p>The band maintained a subterranean stronghold, the Stronghold of the Nine , in the High Forest , on the banks of the Unicorn Run . Before they disbanded, they had links to the Harpers and the Lords of Waterdeep . One of the members, Laeral Silverhand , was using a different name as a leader.</p>
<p>The fortress used to be a dwarven outpost, but under contract, the dwarves expanded it closer to the Unicorn Run under contract for the adventurers.</p>
<h3>Crown of Horns</h3>
<p>In the Year of the Wandering Maiden, 1337 DR , the Nine acquired the Crown of Horns from a crypt underneath Yûlash . When Laeral Silverhand , the leader of the group, donned the headpiece, she descended into madness and the band fragmented into three warring parties.</p>
<p>By 1358 DR , four of the Nine had died; only "Laeral", a wizard , a thief , a warrior , and a priest remained alive and still ensconced in the stronghold. The "Laeral" in that stronghold was visited briefly by Amelior Amanitas , who became imprisoned while looking for a potion of stone to flesh , sometime between Marpenoth 1 and Nightal 1 . Unknown to him, that was a simulacrum left behind by Laeral, who had been rescued by Khelben Arunsun ; while it was publicly believed that he'd rescued her around 1357 DR , she had been in his tower by 1355 DR already, up and active after a long recovery from madness and from a battle of spells with Khelben that left malingering sequels in the High Forest .</p>
<h3>After Laeral's Rescue</h3>
<p>Laeral only kept regular contact with two members of the Nine after her enslavement and subsequent rescue from the Crown : Thanadar of Dragonrock and Arnthiir Windrivv . The two of them were forced to change their names due to a magical curse that allowed any knowing hordlings to teleport themselves to the location of any of the Nine simply by speaking their names.</p>
<p>The stronghold was largely uninhabited a decade later; it was reasonable to expect a gate to Blackstaff Tower . Shortly after, it was reclaimed by a band of elven adventurers who claimed the same name, apparently with the previous leader's blessing.</p>
<h3>1479 DR</h3>
<p>Most nobles of Cormyr had heard rumors that some of the Nine still existed in the post- Spellplague world, trapped in magic items, and could be summoned forth from those items by those who hold them - and know how to activate them - to fight as the item-bearers' slaves. By 1479 DR , only two of these entrapped spirits, known as Blueflame ghosts , had been discovered: Treth Halonter and Relve Langral , trapped in the Wyverntongue Chalice and Flying Blade respectively.</p>
<p>Manshoon claimed to know of the existence of six - maybe seven - items containing souls of the Nine.</p>
