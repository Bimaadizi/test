<p>Quabah was a small village that lay south of the Pit of the Ghuls within the High Desert of Zakhara .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The village was originally founded by nomads hailing from the Mountains of the Lizard's Tongue as a religious retreat. Most of these nomads were devoted acolytes of Hajama the Courageous and Haku the "Master of the Desert Wind."</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Quabah's original founders were all strictly celibate males.</p>
<p>The culture of Quabah changed when Yezeed , a revisionist leader, adjusted their doctrines to allow marriage. Within a generation, women began flocking to Quabah, as word had spread that the men treated their wives with the same reverence they showed the gods.</p>
