<p>Example conversion between the years for 1 DR</p>
<p>Years (winters) are referred to by names, each name consistent across the Realms. Each kingdom or city-state numbers years differently, usually to measure the reign of a dynasty or the current monarch, or since the founding of the country. The result is a hodgepodge of overlapping numbers that serve to confuse the ordinary person and frustrate the sage. The widespread differing year dates include the following:</p>
<h2>Methods of Reckoning</h2>
<h3>Dalereckoning (DR)</h3>
<p>Dalereckoning is taken from the Year of Sunrise, 1 DR , when the Standing Stone was raised by the elves of Cormanthyr and the humans of the Dalelands . Since this time, humans were permitted by the Elven Court to settle in the more open regions of the forests. In some texts, primarily those which do not have direct ties to Dalesfolk history, Dalereckoning is called Freeman's Reckoning (FR). The calendar is widely used in Faerûn but has not spread beyond its shores.</p>
<h3>Cormyr Reckoning (CR)</h3>
<p>Cormyr Reckoning begins at the foundation of House Obarskyr , the dynasty that still rules that land. The 25-year gap between Cormyr Reckoning and Dalereckoning has caused much of the confusion regarding elder days. Timelines and calendars of the period often use DR designators, but place the founding of Cormyr at 1 DR instead of 26 DR . This is understandable, given that the two reckonings are from two nearby parties and spread by a third (the merchants of Sembia), but it causes learned sages to slam their heads violently against their desks trying to figure things out.</p>
<h3>Tethyreckoning (TR)</h3>
<p>Tethyreckoning begins with Founding Year, Year 0 TR, in −212 DR , when Darrom Ithal of Clan Ithal retook the city of Myratma from the Calishites in the Battle of the Purple Marches and was crowned king of Tethyr by the clans. This dating system was rarely used outside of official legal documents in Tethyr.</p>
<h3>Northreckoning (NR)</h3>
<p>Used in the City of Waterdeep , Northreckoning dates from the year Ahghairon became the first Lord of Waterdeep ( 1032 DR ). A more archaic system called Waterdeep Years (WY) dates from the supposed first use of Waterdeep as a trading post. This reckoning is now largely abandoned except in ancient texts.</p>
<h3>Mulhorand Calendar (MC)</h3>
<p>One of the oldest calendars in use in the Realms, this ancient scheme of record-keeping dates from the founding of Skuld , the City of Shadows, reputedly by a Mulhorandi god.</p>
<h3>Netheril Year Calendar (NY)</h3>
<p>Used by the Netherese , it places 0 NY on −3859 DR , when several villages on the shore of the Narrow Sea combined for mutual protection, forming the Alliance of Seventon , which later became Netheril . The Netheril Year calendar was created by Nether to celebrate the union.</p>
<h3>Present Reckoning (PR)</h3>
<p>In an attempt to get a handle on the various number systems in use, a new type of reckoning has been implemented with the approval of such worthies as Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun of Waterdeep and Vangerdahast of Cormyr and carried abroad by the Harpers . All year-dates trace back to the Time of Troubles in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , as year 0.</p>
<h3>Amnian Calendar</h3>
<p>The local calendar of Amn was based on the founding of Athkatla and the opening of its market on Shieldmeet in Year of Greybeards, 100 DR , which served as year 0. However, the Amnian calendar was largely irrelevant and rarely used outside of some official documents, with the vast majority of the population using Dalereckoning instead.</p>
<h3>Impilturan Calendar</h3>
<p>The old calendar of Impiltur was the primary reckoning tradition in the so-called Demonlands , including Damara , the Great Dale , Impiltur, Narfell , and Vaasa . It began with the founding of the kingdom of Impiltur, which in Dalereckoning occurred in the Year of Splendor, −74 DR . The calendar distinguished itself from Dalereckoning by marking the passing of "sardals," the term for "years" in the Damaran language . It is also sometimes called Damaran Reckoning .</p>
<h3>Kozakuran Calendar</h3>
<p>The Kozakuran calendar began when the first human emperor, Mori , ascended to the throne. In Dalereckoning this occurred in Year of Swift Courtships, −73 DR . This calendar groups years into cycles rather than centuries. Each cycle last 60 years. Years can be shown in two ways; in cycles or cumulatively. For example the 23rd year in the 10th cycle could be shown as 10/23 or 563.</p>
<h3>Moonshae Calendar</h3>
<p>On the Moonshae Isles , the years are counted from the corronation of Cymrych Hugh , the first High King. In Dalereckoning this occurred during the 201 DR .</p>
<h3>Serôsian Calendar</h3>
<p>The Timesongs of Serôs , used by many of the underwater-dwelling races of Faerûn, were created by the Lorekeeper Arkallus Vordahl and adopted by the shalarin and some merfolk in the Year of No Regrets, −69 DR , to mark the Third Passing of the shalarin. A year consisted of ten months or "songs" of 36 days each with a five-day (six, in leap years) festival added to complete the year.</p>
<h3>Shou Calendar</h3>
<p>In Shou Lung the years are counted from the year that Nung Fu first ascended the throne as the Emperor. In Dalereckoning this occurred in −1250 DR .</p>
<h3>Ulutiun Calendar</h3>
<p>The calendar of the Ulutiun people of the Great Glacier began with the supposed death of the god Ulutiu and the corresponding "birth" of the Great Glacier as the necklace of Ulutiu sank into the sea and began to freeze the ocean. The Ulutiun year 0 thus corresponded to −2550 DR .</p>
<h3>Untheric Calendar (UC)</h3>
<p>The Untheric calendar began when Gilgeam , the God-King of Unther, ascended to the throne. It places 1 UC in −734 DR .</p>
<h3>Wa Calendar</h3>
<p>The calendar of Wa began with year 1 being the beginning of the Goshukara dynasty. This corresponded to Shou year 833 or the Year of Harbor's Lights, −417 DR .</p>
<h2>Names of the Years</h2>
<p>Augathra the Mad wrote a list of names of years , thousands of them. These names were stored in the library of Candlekeep and were universally used across Faerûn. It was rare that events within a year didn't have something to do with its name. All of these names are referred to as the Roll of Years .</p>
