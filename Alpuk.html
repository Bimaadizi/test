<p>Alpuk , also called the Central Basin , was the largest of the three regions of the Great Glacier and the home of the Iulutiun people.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Great Glacier was naturally divided into three regions. The largest region was Alpuk, located in the southwest and bordered by the Uppuk River in the north, the Tuutsaas Chain in the west, the Lugsaas Chain in the south, and the Keryjek Ridge in the east. The region of Angalpuk was to the east, and Nakvaligach to the north.</p>
<p>Alpuk encompassed the two largest seas in the Great Glacier, the Nakalpgotak and the Lugalpgotak . The mysterious mountainous region known as Novularond , home of frost giants and arctic dwarves , was also within its borders.</p>
<p>Most of the land was at a low elevation, but the ground was rough and occasionally contained rolling hills.</p>
<h2>Weather</h2>
<p>Average temperatures in Alpuk ranged from −30​ to ​35 ℉ (−34​ to ​1.7 ℃ ) from Mirtul to Kythorn . In the month of Flamerule , temperatures ranged from 0​ to ​50 ℉ (−18​ to ​10 ℃ ). During the months of Eleasis through Uktar , they ranged from −35​ to ​20 ℉ (−37​ to ​−6.7 ℃ ). The winters were bitter and long. Temperatures fell as low as −75 ℉ (−59 ℃ ) from Nightal to Tarsakh and rarely rose any higher than −10 ℉ (−23 ℃ ). Strong winds could make them temperatures seem even colder. These usually blew from the north or the south.</p>
<p>Only 5​ to ​8 inches (13​ to ​20 centimeters) of precipitation fell on Alpuk per year on average.</p>
<p>The ice depth over much of Alpuk was between 200​ to ​500 feet (61​ to ​150 meters), though it thinned to as little as 5​ to ​10 feet (1.5​ to ​3 meters) in some areas. Because of this, traditional building materials, such as mud, stone, or wood were hard to come by.</p>
<h2>Flora & Fauna</h2>
<p>Wild caribou herds lived in the hills and mountains of Alpuk, though not nearly in the large numbers seen east in Angalpuk. The strange creatures known as "walrus dogs", or kupuk , lived wild in Alpuk and were often tamed by the Ulutiuns . Seals were plentiful within the two great lakes of Alpuk. The white-furred heteff breed of sled dog was also native to the region.</p>
<p>Two monsters lived in Alpuk that caused fear among its people— white dragons and the bizarre centipede-like tirichik .</p>
<p>Very little vegetation grew in Alpuk. A few exceptions were mikka , a mint-flavored, black lichen growing near streams, and seal berries , found on the shore of the Lugalpgotak Sea.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Alpuk was first settled by humans in −1648 DR by hunters and explorers from Sossal , who were ambushed by a tirichik and then lost. They eventually found their way to the Lugalpgotak Sea and settled around its shores.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The primary inhabitants of Alpuk were the Iulutiun tribes, descendents of the first settlers from Sossal. The estimated population of Iulutiuns in 1359 DR was between 42,500 and 63,750, and this accounted for about 85% of the total human population of the Great Glacier. The most populous areas were around the two great seas.</p>
<p>Arctic dwarves, known as Innugaakalikurit , and frost giants also lived in Alpuk.</p>
