<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the army assembled by the Cult of the Absolute moved from the Moonrise Towers in Chionthar Valley to menace the city of Baldur's Gate , displacing countless refugees along the way in the process. Some of the Baldurians did not take kindly to the refugees flooding the outskirts of the city, while others took to protesting. Mandii Harvestmoon was among the protestors in Rivington and believed that there should be more guards patrolling the refugee tent city, protecting Baldurians from them. She was also a supporter of the city's new Archduke Enver Gortash and his steel watchers .</p>
