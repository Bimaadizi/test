<p>The only person who he was affectionate with was his fellow crew-member Sharessa "The Shadow" Stagwood .</p>
<p>Even after his old captain's, Blackfingers Ralingor's death, Kurthe remained passionately loyal to him, to a fault.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Kissing Shark was not the first ship Kurthe sailed with, the firs one was attacked and burnt down by Doegan Dogs in Port Halovar .</p>
<p>Sometime in 1371 DR , the pirate ship of Kissing Shark was destroyed in a blast of smoke powder . The captain of the ship Blackfingers Ralingor perished and only seven of the Sharkers survived. The ex-slave from Konigheim , Kurthe "Longshanks" Lornar was one of them. Together the Sharkers saved one chest off the Kissing Shark . Later, the group found themselves in the tavern of Donder's Dancing Masques in Tharkar . There a mysterious benefactor named Belmer Droon rescued them from one of the frequent bar fights, and help the Sharkers avoiding the brutal law enforcement of the Daggers of Tharkar .</p>
<p>Once the Sharkers and their savior reached the safety of Ankle Bells , Belmer revealed his agenda, he were too pay generously to a group of mercenaries to perform a mission in the capital of Doegan . After the pirates agreed, Belmer had their writs signed and they embarked on a mission to find and assassinate a noblewoman, Eidola of Neverwinter .</p>
<p>Under the cover of night, in secrecy, the group boarded the ship Morning Bird . Soon after the ship left the port, it came under an attack from an unknown black ship that bombarded the Bird with fire pot missiles and terrifying bone ball s that melted away in the flames revealing dancing floating armed skeletons . The Sharkers and their benefactors managed to fight off the undead and evaded the black ship with the aid of Balmer's box of mists and a prayer-token of Umberlee . The box transported ship into a different part of the sea away from the pursuit, but the prayer token of the fickle goddess summoned her servants on board of the ghost ship . The ship spawned the dreaded sea zombies and the crew of Morning Bird had to appease Umberlee by tossing their valuables overboard.</p>
<p>During the short respite, the suspicious employer mixed an exotic drug yulchass powder in with the crew's food. The powder has a side effect of making its imbibers truthful. This made the Konigheimer even more suspicious of their boss, even though Belmer had good reasons. The ship followed them, somehow tracking them. After a long search, the Sharkers and Belmer found a magical scrying device hidden on the bottom on the Sharker' chest. .</p>
<p>Soon after, the mysterious black ship, now identified as the Black Dragon , caught up with the Morning Bird . The pursuing captain was the infamous Orim Redbeard , the pirate responsible for the death of Blackfingers Ralingor. Kruthe's short temper and rabid devotion to his old captain pushed him to attempt to attack Redbeard. Belmer knowing to expect it hit the tall Konigheimer over the head knocking him out. Orim Redbeard realized that he pursued the wrong ship, and left the Sharkers in peace. Meanwhile, Kurthe Lornar came back to his senses, fuming with rage over the what he perceived as betrayal. He attacked the benefactor in blind rage, while his fellow Sharkers stayed out of combat. Belmer showed uncanny skill and finesse avoiding Kurthe's brute attacks. Giving the hotheaded pirates plenty of warnings, Belmer continued leaving cuts and slices on Konigheimer's body. The pirate never stood down and died soaked in his own blood with Belmer's dagger in his neck. .</p>
