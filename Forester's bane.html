<p>The forester's bane , otherwise known as a snapper-saw , was a very rare type of low-growing shrub.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This plant was largely green to dark green. Its leaves were tough and broad, with sinewy ribs that radiated 5​ to ​7 feet (1.5​ to ​2.1 meters) from the bushy center. Within this center was three to six purple stalks with saw-toothed edges. Any leaves or stalks removed would regrow within two to eight weeks. Overall their bodies measured 15 feet (4.6 meters) in a radius.</p>
<p>Within the center of this bush grew large, plump berries that had a sweet smell to them. These berries were typically bright yellow, golden, greenish, or white. They were said to be very delicious and rich in protein.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>These plants possessed no intelligence.</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>Whenever a creature stepped on or near the leaves of this plant, they would snap shut around them. The saw-toothed edges on the plant's stalks then gradually sawed away at the trapped prey.</p>
