<p>Ravids were long, one-armed, serpentine creatures native to the Positive Energy plane .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A ravid was a solitary creature that looked like a long albino eel or snake 7 feet (2.1 meters) long, except they had a single claw jutting out from their body near the head. Weighing around 75 pounds (34 kilograms), they floated by some innate power.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Surprisingly docile, they would float around the Positive energy plane and, on encountering any inanimate object, would imbue them with life. These animated objects would attempt to protect the ravid to the best of their abilities.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Ravids were infused with the positive energy of their native plane. As such, they would defend with rending claws against anyone attacking them or, if the hostile creature was undead , lash out with their tails and hurt them with jolts of positive energy.</p>
<p>This positive energy also enabled the ravid to animate objects , which they did continually, amassing a small following of animated objects that followed them around.</p>
<p>Should they lose their ability to float by some magical means, they became greatly hampered as their fighting was predicated on their flight.</p>
