<p>Sergeant Elenna Thrinn was a dwarf of the Underdark that joined the cult of the Absolute during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Thrinn was a pragmatic follower of the Absolute, not as zealous or self-righteous as some other devotees. She was however wholly dedicated to the Absolute's cause and readily deferred to her True Soul superiors.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>In addition to her other gear, Thrinn kept on her person a magical ring called a bracing band . She also had a favorite pair of boots of speed , but they were stolen by the gnome rebel Thulla .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She served the cult under the direction of True Soul Nere , a particularly entitled and self-important drow .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Nere and Sergeant Thrinn led the cult's excavation of Grymforge, seeking out an ancient Sharran temple within its depths. To aid them in their efforts, Thrinn hired on fellow duergar raiders of Clan Flameshade .</p>
<p>As Clan Flameshade's deep gnome slaves dug through rock and earth, they inadvertently trigged a trap that caved-in a portion the tunnel True Soul Nere was standing in. The drow cult leader and a few gnome slaves became trapped behing a pile of rubble, in a small chamber that gradually filled with some manner of poisonous gas. Thrinn took over as overseer of the Flameshade mercenaries and their gnome slaves, doubling their efforts to dig out and free the Absolute's True Soul.</p>
