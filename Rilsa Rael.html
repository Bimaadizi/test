<p>Rilsa Rael was a crime lord of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR . She was one of the high-ranking kingpins of the Guild .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Rilsa thought that the Flaming Fists were callous and uncaring of the poor Baldurian citizens. She believed that the nobles and rich were all to blame for the terrible conditions of the inhabitants of the Outer City district.</p>
<p>She was known for loyalty to the Guild―more specifically its leader Astele "Nine-Fingers" Keene ―her creativity for problem-solving and underlying ruthlessness in all manners. Unlike her mistress, who maintained a respectful distance from all matters, Rilsa preferred to work personally with others in Guild business.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>In addition to her criminal activities, Rilsa ran the Calim Jewel Emporium in the Little Calimshan district. It was within that shop she held a form of open court, in order to truly hear the concerns of the people she watched over. She also oversaw a local called the Garden of Whispers , a meeting place by which individuals or organizations could deal in secrets with ensure anonymity.</p>
<p>Among other deed, Rilsa orchestrated robberies of the wealthy in order to distribute their riches to the poor citizens of the Outer City.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She was the favored and most trusted individual among Nine-Fingers' lieutenants, known as the Lady's Court. As the Guild reached the apex of its power, Rilsa remained poised as the organization's heir apparent.</p>
<p>She had a good ally in Ettvard Needle , operator of the Baldur's Mouth broadsheet . Needle held great respect for Rilsa and her dedication to the Baldurian's of the Outer City.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When she was young, Rilsa's father was hung by soldiers of the Flaming Fist, and her mother became a courtesan to an influential member of the Baldurian nobility . Rilsa was left alone in the world when her mother was later imprisoned by her lover's spurned wife. To survive, the young Rilsa joined one of the street gangs in Norchapel .</p>
<p>During her rise to power, Rilsa Rael fully brought Little Calimshan under the influence of the Guild .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Narthex Murders, 1482 DR , Rilsa was involved in the crisis that culminated in the resurrection of Bhaal .</p>
<p>Rilsa still held onto power over the the course of the following decade. By the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR however, the Right Pashas , a Calishite gang based in Little Calimshan, saw the Guild as an outsider group and fought to force the Guild out of what they saw as their territory. When the Guild entered a turf war against the Stone Lord , a fierce warrior under the control of the Cult of the Absolute , Rilsa Rael broke peace with the Pashas of Little Calimshan, after one of their leaders proclaimed Nine-Fingers' reign was over. The man claimed to know what the Guildmaster was thinking and how her downfall was inevitable. Rilsa Rael retaliated by cutting his finger off and mailing it to Nine-Fingers along with the note on what had happened. But Rilsa was sure that the headman of the Pashas now knew Nine-Fingers' mind a little better.</p>
