<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>She was the proprietor of Sangora Sanguinaries at the Corpse Market where she sold warm blood. As a side business, she also sold information about Evernight for a hefty price (or for an answer to a probing question). She was very knowledgeable about things like Evernight history and phenomena such as the Crevices of Dusk .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the 1490s DR , Sangora was active in Evernight and had not been to Neverwinter in over ten years (not since before Dagult Neverember had earned the respect of that city's people).</p>
