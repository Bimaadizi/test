<p>Kuldahar Pass was a vale between Easthaven and Kuldahar in the Spine of the World .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>On the outskirts of the pass was a small mill, which was often used as a base for marauding goblins .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1281 DR , a large number of unusual disturbances began to occur in the pass. These included storms arriving without warning and lasting for days, goblins roaming the area in unusual numbers due to voices in their head drawing them to the area, and seemingly organized groups of giants moving through the pass.</p>
<p>Around that year a band of adventurers lead by Hrothgar were ambushed in the pass on their way to Kuldahar by a group of frost giants led by Kreg Frostbeard , under orders by the devil Belhifet to cause an avalanche. In conjunction with the magic of Crenshinibon , they managed to block off all access between Easthaven and Kuldahar.</p>
