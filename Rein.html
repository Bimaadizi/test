<p>The Rein family were a wealthy and controversial family based in the city of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale in the 14 th century DR . They were owners of the Red Boar Inn , Red Boar Trading Coster , and other ventures in the Delimbiyr Vale .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hailing from Waterdeep , the Rein family settled in Loudwater in the 1310s DR and there they built the Red Boar Inn . For lumber, they cut down a massive oak tree that had been growing on the siteâ€”a tragic act that would anger the local elves for decades to come. Nevertheless, a remnant of this oak was used as the main pillar in the common room and not long after it was built, the pillar came to be used as a community notice board.</p>
<p>The Reins would prosper and later led the Red Boar Trading Coster.</p>
<p>In the summer of the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the people of the neighboring town of Orlbar revolted against the tyrannical rule of the Zhentarim that had seized control of their town, and they were backed by Loudwater. But Jesym Rein turned traitor to both the Orlbar rebels and the Loudwater soldiers, and thanks to her, the Zhentarim and clerics of Iyachtu Xvim brutally crushed the rebellion and Loudwater was forced to sign the Oath of Orlbar , a peace treaty that marked a border between the two states in the years after. Her actions tarnished the Rein name with a reputation for treachery.</p>
<p>However, their reputation was soon healed in only the autumn of that year. At that time, Stedd Rein returned from the College of War in Athkatla , and while he was still en route to Loudwater, Deldron departed the city to greet his son and conduct business in Daggerford , taking the Red Boar Trading Coster's sizeable guard with him. But a magical communication from Loudwater alerted Deldron about a vicious lycanthrope attack, known as the Night of the Blood Moon , and the Reins and their Red Boar guard hastened to return. Arriving in time to aid in the third day of fighting, Stedd Rein displayed courage and leadership and his actions saved many lives, and he earned praise and accolades. It improved the Rein name, erasing the earlier memory of Jesym's treachery and earning them the support of the Beutaleen'dal elven house.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The Reins continued to own the Red Boar Inn, but left it to be managed by others.</p>
<p>The Rein family owned a pair of coasters that operated between Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Despite Stedd's heroism, Jesym's betrayal was not forgotten, and in the early 1370s DR there were still some in Loudwater who believed the Reins would ultimately prove treacherous and must be kept an eye on. The nine great elven families of Loudwater in particular typically opposed anything to do with the Reins, though the Beutaleen'dals eventually supported them.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Some thought the Reins had "great fashion sense".</p>
