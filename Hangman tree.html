<p>The hangman tree , also commonly known as a gallows tree , was a rare species of sentient, carnivorous trees found most commonly in temperate to subtropical climates.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These trees resembled thick oaks , but with few branches, sparse foliage, and shallow root systems. Knot-like protuberances were present where their sensory organs were, usually high up on their trunks, while the lower trunks displayed a scar-like place for expulsion of indigestibles.</p>
<p>The name of this species was derived from their sinewy, rope -like vines, which were said to resemble a hangman's noose. Each hangman tree had six to nine of these, but could only control three of them at any given time. Each could lift creatures weighing no greater than a 1,000 pounds (450 kilograms). The upper trunk of a hangman tree had an opening where prey was thrown into the "stomach" within the barrel of its trunk. This opening was surrounded by sharp growths that pointed down and inward towards its digestive cavity, hindering any attempts of prey to escape.</p>
<p>The digestive cavity in the barrel of the trunk of the hangman tree was large enough to hold three human -sized victims and secreted acid to break down prey.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Hangman trees were a rather dimwitted species.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>These tree had a hallucinatory perfume that they could release at will, usually doing so while prey was within 30​ to ​80 feet (9.1​ to ​24 meters) of them. This perfume caused those affected by it to believe the hangman tree to be some ordinary sort of treant or quickwood . A tree of this sort can speak haltingly in Common learned over the years. Each also has a magic resistance based on its age because it draws power from the environment.</p>
<h3>Biology</h3>
<p>Hangman trees moved at very slowly rates. Saplings were known to move about 6 feet (1.8 meters), while mature trees could about one-third that rate at a few feet per day.</p>
<p>During freezing weather, a hangman tree would typically put down a taproot and down go dormant. although indigestible items will be expelled from the belly-trunk periodically.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>These trees attacked by dropping their noose-like appendages down around prey. Once in contact with a victim, the vine-like appendage would draw tight and begin lifting the prey up to the upper trunk's opening.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Hangman trees were generally solitary creatures.</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>These trees were carnivorous nature, as their sparse leaves and shallow root systems did not provide them sufficient nutrition.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>In Cormanthor , hangman trees could be found in the woodlands between Mistledale and Shadowdale . Beyond the Prime Material plane , hangman trees could be found in the Shadowfell .</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>Hangman trees could generally speak Common , learning it over many years, but spoke so haltingly.</p>
