<p>Galath was an apprentice of the Magelords of Athalantar in the early 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>In the opinion of the senior magelords, Galath was over-eager, inept, and tiresome.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Many of the magelords privately harbored scornful views of Galath's abilities. Briost Elthauryn, for one, wondered if he could put on a tabard the right way, knew how to unroll a scroll , or even how to open a spellbook .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Galath served the Magelords of Athalantar. Briost Elthauryn , a magelord, had had his patience tested to its limits by Galath.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Galath was present in a moot of the Magelords, attended also by Briost, Undarl Dragonrider , Nasarn , and Alarashan Tlor in the Year of Bloodflowers, 234 DR . During the meeting, the elimination of Elmara, a priestess of Mystra who was secretly the prince Elminster Aumar , was discussed, as Prince Gartos had been sent after her. Though Galath was eager to learn and to serve, he said many things that came off as unwise, obvious, or impractical to the other magelords; only Undarl gave him credit for enthusiasm.</p>
