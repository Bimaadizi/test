<p>Hopper was one of six horses kept by a group of travelers that lived in the Western Heartlands during the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The older horse had cracked a hoof some time before he and his humans , the mage Druhallen , Galimer , Rozt'a , and Tiep , arrived at Parnast in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR . That year, he and five other horses, including Bandy , Cardinal , Ebony , Fowler , and Star , accompanied the party, on a journey through the Greypeak Mountains to the old mines of Dekanter . Tiep rode Hopper for a ways until the young lad was forced to simply lead the old horse.</p>
<p>During the journey Hopper's injured hoof got worse, and it became apparent he would not endure the full trip through the mountains and back again. Understanding that Hopper would die regardless the circumstances, Druhallen and the others decided to sacrifice the gelding to appease a tribe of Dekanter goblins and help ensure safe passage through the mines. Druhallen conjured fire within Hopper's brain to ensure a quick death, and let the goblins feast on his remains.</p>
