<p>The Heartlands of Cormyr was an informal region of the Forest Kingdom that was made up of the lands around the King's Forest , which included the oldest and most important cities of the realm.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The popular imagination of Cormyr was largely based on the King's Forest and the surrounding lands. This protected woodland was a site of great natural beauty, home to beasts and fey , as well as many villages and lost ruins of the realm. The forest was bordered by the farmlands that supported much of the realm's population, the country estates of the nobility, and the major highways that held Cormyr together.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The heartlands were roughly bounded by the Storm Horns and west reaches of Cormyr , the Wyvernwater and coastal region to the east, and the Dragonmere to the south. The north was met by the Stonecliffs and broad east reaches , marking the start of the Stonelands . The heartlands were bisected by the Starwater River , which passed south from the northern Storm Horns through to the Dragonmere.</p>
