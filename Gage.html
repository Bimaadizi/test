<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gage was so wiry he was often thought to have wood elf stock.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Gage was witty and boisterous.</p>
<p>He didn't consider himself evil, stealing mostly from the rich and the wicked, killing only those who were evil. However, he didn't care for righting wrongs.</p>
<p>He was also inordinately tenacious, following Kiril even though she warned him not to on pain of death, even across the Yuirwood, Sildëyuir, and even the Underdungeon of Stardeep, all while staying hidden.</p>
<p>He was, however, genuine enough to recommend Kiril avoid restoring her bond to Angul .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Per Kiril Duskmourn, Gage fought "like a wildcat", disabling foes quickly, even trained knights. He was also a sure-footed and excellent climber. Despite his differences with his possessed glove and his poor treatment of it, he consistently got it to do what he wanted, even though he had to threaten the demon with acid sometimes.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Gage made use of alchemical equipment such as inhalant , alchemical lights and even explosive bulbs on occassion. He also knew of alchemically produced acids , and wielded the Hands of Paymon between 1374 DR and 1375 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>While a thief, Gage mostly struck against the rich and the wicked. Those he killed, he considered evil.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He became close friends with Kiril during her passage through the tavern circuit of Laothkund.</p>
<p>In killing Stolsin , the Grinder of Tribes, he acquired a bond which Sathra used to track him.</p>
<p>The demon bound to the Hands of Paymon often reminded Gage he'd eat his soul.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In winter of 1375 DR , after having accompanied Kiril Duskmourn for some time in the city's tavern circuit, Gage snuck into the Shadow Tongue lair in Laothkund to recover the sword Angul . After acquiring the blade, he fought Sathra and Stolsin, slaying one and making the other flee. However, the victory came at the cost of allowing the blade control.</p>
<p>Next he struck a tavern, completely dominated by the sword he carried; it was only thanks to Kiril's intervention that the sword let him go Afterwards Gage said that Sathra had let slip that she been hired to take the blade by Nangulis , in order to motivate Kiril to return to Stardeep.. Kiril came to explain her story, and decided to head for Stardeep.</p>
<p>While in the Yuirwood, Gage and Kiril were attacked by Sathra and a reanimated Stolsin. He quickly brushed aside the fact Sathra had not died once Kiril inquired. Gage began to grow uneasy when they closed in on Stardeep. When they arrived near Stardeep's Causeway , Gage uncovered some corpses using his glove; as Empyrean Knights rode out to meet Kiril, he attacked them and warned her that they were after her sword. Though it saved her life, Kiril became suspicious of his motives; Gage confessed to his true agenda. When Kiril learned Gage had been hired to steal her blade, she parted ways with him; Gage decided to follow her anyway, from a distance, and hidden.</p>
<p>Gage crossed the same portal Kiril had used, but was delayed in following by two nilshai attacking him. He used the Hands of Paymon to track Kiril through Sildëyuir and into the Underdungeon , where he was attacked by a stone spider and lost the enchanted glove after using an explosive to attack the spider, which loosed the demon. He took the opportunity to flee when the spider came back up to attack the demon.</p>
<p>Eventually, he crossed the Empyrean Knights again. Gage then caught up to the rearguard of the knights, and disabled one, taking his armor as disguise before catching up to the rest, just in time to be swept up in Raidon Kane 's teleportation into the the Well . in Kiril's battle against Telarian, Gage managed to sneak behind the latter and deal the final blow. After helping strike down the keeper, he revealed himself to Kiril, and they were back on good terms.</p>
