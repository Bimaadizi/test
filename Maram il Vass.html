<p>Maram il Vass was a powerful ultroloth in the Deep Wastes n the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Maram had found a better approach than warmongering. Instead, he developed a refuge on the Prime Material Plane from which to trade his goods and his secrets.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Maram was cunning and had a painstaking attention to detail, yet was extremely charming, a trait he knew how to use.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Maram was once an ultroloth living in Gehenna . At one point, he worked for the demon lord Graz'zt in the Outer Planes , distinguishing himself in his service, and the two separated on good terms.</p>
<p>However, after becoming bored of war, Maram constructed a refuge in the Deep Wastes in Toril 's Underdark . There, he worked to expand his collections of exotic things and beings.</p>
<p>Circa 1486 DR , with the arrival of Graz'zt in the Underdark, Maram renewed his partnership with the demon lord. At the same time, he used this connection to add to his collection. Queen Hledh Hellspawn of Maerimydra granted him the drow alchemist Xaven Tanor'this of Szith Morcane .</p>
<p>Later, an adventuring party hired by Murssvayas Dhuurniv went to Maram's lair to free Xaven.</p>
