<p>Ulek the Burrower was a goblin sapper who served the Legion of the Chimera in the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , the town of Targos in Icewind Dale became besieged by the Legion of the Chimera. One of the Legion's surprise attacks involved teleporting a troop of goblins from underground tunnels into the Targos docks. A group of goblin sappers made it into the basement of one of the warehouses in the docks, led by Ulek the Burrower . Once inside, a goblin leader named Rukwurm , used a magic scroll provided by Phaen of the Rags that transported more goblins into Targos. Eventually, a group of adventurers from Luskan discovered the collapsed smugglers' tunnels and disposed of both goblin leaders while slaughtering their marauding troops.</p>
