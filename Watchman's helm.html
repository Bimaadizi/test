<p>Watchman's helms were enchanted helmets that received their names from Helm , the god of guardians, or for simply being popular among watchmen.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR , these helmets were in high demand among folk who made living by guarding people, possessions, and places. However, Watchman's helms were just as popular among thieves and rogues for the same reasons.</p>
<p>In 1374 DR , a Watchman's helm was offered to brave adventurers who were strong enough to exterminate undead creatures out of the Mere of Dead Men .</p>
