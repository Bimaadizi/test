<p>During the Dracorage in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , the Harpers of Twilight Hall sent Baltron to Baldur's Gate to apprentice with Velsaert , an expert on dragons . Baltron's purpose was to study all that was known about the Dracorage in order to inform his superiors on how to proceed. Unfortunately, Velsaert was secretly a dragon and had himself succumbed to the Dracorage. Irritated by his incessant questions, he transformed and attacked Baltron with his claws. It is unknown if he survived.</p>
