<p>Zarwu Koi was a chanshi and a caravan guard in Ch'ing Tung Province in Shou Lung .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He had a stocky build.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Zarwu was a veteran soldier.</p>
<p>In late Shou Year 2608 (1358 DR) or early Shou Year 2609 (1359 DR) , a merchants guild hired Zarwu to act as a guard for caravans along the Ningtang Road in order to eliminate the growing menace of bandits in the western hills of Ch'ing Tung. To this end, Zarwu posed as a bandit and explored the hills until he came across the group and introduced himself. He learned that they were from the far Chukei Plains and that they were going south to Chu' Yuan in order to rob people visiting the Komite at Suijeng . They hoped to make more ill-gotten profit in a week than they would in a year back home. During the night, Zarwu killed the sleeping bandits and took their heads to the merchants guild, and received his reward.</p>
<p>Afterward, he decided to go south to Mishan and travel down the Hungtse River in order to see the Komite and maybe even participate himself.</p>
