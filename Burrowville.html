<p>Burrowville was a halfling town and a vacation destination for adventurers that stood on the Ridge in Amn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Burrowville stood on the hills between craggy Ridge to the south and the Snakewood to the north. A small baron trail crossed the Ridge and eventually led to a road connected to the town's southern neighbor – Keczulla . Despite being the shortest ride, the trail was rarely used by merchants and travelers who used a much longer road that looped around the Ridge; instead, traveling the long way around to Keczulla took over 25 days. The shorter way was a dangerous option as it passed a wild territory of trolls , bugbears , leprechauns , wolves , and cyclopses . The shorter of the roads had an Amnian tent outpost and a small garrison keep, four days travel from Burrowville.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Burrowville was governed by the town council from the town hall at the town center. The mayor helmed the council. In the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , the mayor was Ned Burrower . Years after the Zhentarim incident, councilman Malakii Farseer was elected mayor after years of civil service.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The town's main export was the rarest type of tobacco grown exclusively in the fields outside of town. Blueleaf Tobacco could be found as far as the city of Ravens Bluff . The tobacco was believed to possess invigorating properties that fought tiredness when inhaled.</p>
<p>The tobacco fields were mortgaged by Burrowville in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, due to the town's financial strains due to poor harvest. The annual payments depended on the crops at 12,000 danters per year.</p>
<p>Apart from vacationing and tobacco trade, the hin community kept mules and ponies and grew gooseberries .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, a famous stout folk adventuring company, the Short People , used Burrowville as their vacationing spot. During that time, a plot by the dreaded Zhentarim became known to one of the city councilmen – Malakii Farseer. In attempts to establish a foothold in Amn, the Zhentarim purchased Burrowville's mortgage. If Burrowville could not pay the year's mortgage of 12,000 danters on time, the Black Network would claim the town's ownership in foreclosure. This was likely to happen as Burrowville suffered three years of poor harvest due to weather. To make things direr, the Zhentarim bullied local merchants into offering a ridiculously low price for Burrowville's harvest.</p>
<p>Malakii Farseer enrolled the aid of the famed Short People in escorting crop wagons to the markets of Keczulla, where Burrowville would be able to offer a fair price for the luxurious tobacco. Halfling named Theodore "Badger" Thistledown was put in charge of the shipment. On their way, the Short People fought through monsters, leprechauns, "toll" bandits, Zhentarim saboteurs, and ended up rescuing the shipment of tobacco from a foolish young copper dragon Florizzilikar . Despite their best attempts, the Burrowville Blueleaf was destroyed, but the adventurers managed to recover the dragon's horde, saving the town from ruination.</p>
<p>In reward, the adventurers were given gold from the transaction, permission to construct a shrine to Moradin , a set of silk finery, two of the Short People – Ally Thistledown and Verna Burrtoes , received positions on the town council, while "Badger" Thistledown received a profitable teamster contract. The adventurers were also named the Knights of Burrowville and granted honorary titles of the town council members.</p>
