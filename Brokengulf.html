<p>The Brokengulf family ( pronounced : /ˈ b r oʊ k ɛ n g ʊl f / BROH-ken-gulf ) of Waterdeep was a wealthy mercantile house that had been a part of the city's nobility for over a hundred years as of the mid–14 th century DR . They were renowned explorers and hunters who were known for tracking and capturing wild beasts.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The family owned a villa in the Sea Ward , on the south side of Wrightstone Street between Diamond Street and Mendever Street .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>House Brokengulf was ennobled in the Year of the Cockatrice, 1248 DR when the Lords of Waterdeep recognized the various merchant families as nobility within the city and its realm.</p>
<p>The Brokengulfs nearly went bankrupt after losing a great amount of their wealth to the ancient green dragon , Claugiyliamatar , following an elaborate ruse she played on the family's patriarch, Lord Saerlin . When she confronted Saerlin with blackmail, and he in turn sought out a dragonslayer, the great wyrm collapsed the tower of the Brokengulf villa upon him, crippling the lord and killing three of his sisters.</p>
<p>Following the death of Lord Morus Brokengulf I, Morus II returned from the Sword Coast to the family's estate in the Sea Ward to assume his role as the head of House Brokengulf. After a few months of frustration in this role, he turned over operation of the family's business to his friend and fellow Knight, Sir Gareth Cormaeril . When Lady Aridarye Phylund married Prendergast Brokengulf in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , she became the family's matriarch and shared control of the family's interests with Sir Gareth.</p>
