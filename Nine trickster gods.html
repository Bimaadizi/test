<p>The nine trickster gods , also known as the trickster gods of Omu , were a group of primal spirits venerated in the city of Omu in Chult . Each spirit could inhabit another creature, and had a different power it could grant to the individual it inhabited.</p>
<p>The nine trickster gods, placed according to their alignment , were:</p>
<h2>Personalities</h2>
<p>Each trickster god had a different personality according to its alignment—for example, Wongo was very violent and unstable, Moa was calm and honest—and likewise each also had an opposed god whom they hated, again according to their alignment. Unkh was the only exception as she was the embodiment of true neutral . However, regardless of individual differences, all of the trickster gods were ultimately divisive and deceptive. Since they lacked the true power of gods with which to grant miracles to their followers, they instead concocted schemes to winnow the numbers of their clerics and to pit their followers against each other to assert dominance.</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>The Omuan faithful of the trickster gods were expected to live by the mantra of their patron god, to build statues in their name, and to compete and risk their lives for their favor and glory. On festival days, aspiring priests would partake in dangerous (and sometimes deadly) tests in the shrines of each of the nine gods. These trials served as entertainment for the people and as much-needed sacrifices for the spirits.</p>
<p>In an effort to understand and explain the rivalries between different gods, the Omuans concocted a series of colorful stories about their origins.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in the 13 th century DR , Ubtao left the Omuan people to their own fate, having been angered by their greed and vanity. Without his divine guidance, clerics lost their magic, disease ran rampant, and the rest of Chult forsook the city. Soon, the city's slaves rebelled and those with wealth fled. Amidst this chaos, these nine spirits took the forms of powerful animals and arose from the jungles to offer the Omuans power and redemption in exchange for worship and devotion. The desperate Omuans proved easy to bewitch, and soon had torn down their temple of Ubtao and built shrines to worship each god.</p>
<h3>The Tomb of the Nine Gods</h3>
<p>Nine decades later—around the late 14 th century DR— Acererak the demilich came to Omu and, feeling inspired by the deadly trials created in the nine shrines, he killed all nine gods, bound them to magic items , and entombed them in the Tomb of the Nine Gods . Acererak enslaved the Omuans and made them carve out this tomb for their fallen gods, in which he also sealed all of the workers. Because of Omu's isolation from the rest of Chult following their abandonment by Ubtao, the legends and worship of the nine trickster gods largely died with the city.</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, adventurers who delved into the Tomb of the Nine Gods could be possessed by what remained of the spirits of the nine trickster gods, who could then bestow supernatural gifts to their hosts that were unique to each god. In this state, they aspired and schemed to seek revenge on Acererak.</p>
