<p>Bwimb , called the Baron of Ooze , was the first evil archomental of the Paraelemental Plane of Ooze . He was slain by Orcus-as-Tenebrous and succeeded as archomental by Bwimb II .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h3>Enemies</h3>
<p>The good archomental Ben-hadar considered Bwimb one of his biggest annoyances because of Bwimb polluting pure waters.</p>
<h3>Allies</h3>
<p>In life, Bwimb was an ally of Ghaunadaur .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was said that Bwimb was a great and cruel general in the Age Before Ages. That he, like several other evil archomentals, fought in the great war between Law and Chaos as an ally of the Queen of Chaos , against the Wind Dukes of Aaqa . It was also said that he invaded Astral Sea once, in the form of an ocean of acid, but was defeated by the deity Kord. The ruined body of the Ooze Lord fell into the natural world as a rain of acid.</p>
<p>He was summoned to the world of Oerth at least once, for he was known there as Nakimas to a civilization called the Suel, and was called the Mud Lord .</p>
<p>Though according to others, Bwimb only became ruler of the Paraelemental Plane of Ooze because no-one else cared to challenge him, and that he was not truly an archomental. This was disputed by certain writings that did name him a true archomental.</p>
<p>Bwimb was one of several powerful planar entities slain by Tenebrous . In a mistaken belief that Bwimb was in possession of the Wand of Orcus , the undead demon prince gladly slew Bwimb, whom he had nothing but disdain for when the archomental allegedly did nothing but beg for his life during interrogation.</p>
<p>His daughter and successor as archomental of Ooze, Bwimb II, was thought to have formed from his remains after his murder.</p>
