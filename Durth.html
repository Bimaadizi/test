<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1377 DR , Durth was one of the deep gnomes hired by Cavatina Xarann to act as a guide for the combined force of Sshamath wizards and priests of Eilistraee to the main temple of Kiaransalee , which they planned to attack.</p>
<p>However Durth and his companion had long had business with the Crones of Kiaransalee, providing them with voidstone . So they double-crossed the drow . They tried to kill Q'arlynd Melarn but instead Q'arlynd knocked Durth down and killed his companion.</p>
