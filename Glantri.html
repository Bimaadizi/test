<p>Glantri , also known as the Kingdom of Magic , was a powerful magocratic nation on the world of Mystara that on more than one occasion had been visited by individuals from Faer没n and other worlds.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Monsters normally considered rare on Mystara were abundant throughout the nation due to countless magical summonings over the years. Out of all these monsters, notably lycanthropes and vampires were accepted members of society throughout most of the nation.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Glantri was a magocratic nation divided into 13 principalities, semi-independent realms that were each governed by a wizard-prince and their noble house. These wizard-princes each specialized in their own form of magic, which expressed their culture in unique and magical ways. They determined the laws in their respective domains, but ruled the nation together as a council, called the Council of Princes. They assembled at Glantri City to conduct the administration of the nation. All decisions of the Council of Princes were decided by a vote. Whenever a tie occurred, or less than six princes were available for a vote, a judiciary body known as the Parliament (or "House of Lords") was assembled to vote upon the decision.</p>
<p>Mystarans outside of Glantri considered its government to be rather devious, clandestine, and rife with treachery. However, its council of wizard princes were united by an aim to promote arcane magic and make it the leading power in the world of Mystara, leading most people to believe they had the most advanced and powerful wizards.</p>
<p>Practicing arcane magic in Glantri required a license, whilst most divine magic was outlawed alongside organized religion. These bans, as well as the close monitoring of religious orders, were rooted in a fear that they posed a threat to the dominance of arcane power in the nation and its perceived importance. Laws eventually relaxed to allow for the clerical magics of create food or water , cure disease , cure wounds , and remove curse . Others form of clerical magic and open religious practice, such as discussing the tenants of a known doctrine, were punishable with heavy fines. Repeat offenders would be punished with imprisonment or even death.</p>
<p>There were a few other offenses in the nation that were "punishable by death". For example, having lycanthropy was once such an offense, until the Council of Princes repealed the law in all but two principalities.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The primary exports of the nation's various principalities were agricultural and mineral products. Most towns focused on producing one specific form of commodity, be it food, metal, or crafted items.</p>
<p>The nation taxed its citizens four times per year, with the vast amount of wealth accumulated by the principalities going towards the Great School of Magic, particularly its many licensing fees and the taxes that were places upon magical items and spellcastings. Failure to pay taxes was considered a crime like unto treason.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>The principalities of Glantri were primarily made up of elves , half-elves , and humans . Lycanthropes, vampires, and similar such shapechangers were relatively accepted in most of Glantrian society, with the rising of a "were-fad" and a romantic reputation for vampirism. Many wizards considered undead servants both fashionable and useful. And more so than other parts of the Known World, Glantrians tolerated gnolls , goblinoids , kobolds , ogres , orcs and half-orcs , and trolls . The thirteenth principality, New Kolland, was populated almost exclusively by these humanoids .</p>
<p>Glanti overall had a higher population of wizards than neighboring lands. Whereas those lands would have one wizard per 5,000 people, an estimated 1 in 200 Glantrians were wizards. In the nation's capital, this ratio became 1 in 7.</p>
<p>These people were divided into two societal classes, the noble Upper Class and Lower Class. Neither one's race, nor alignment , determined their status in society, but rather one's ability to wield arcane magic. The nobility was primarily made up of wizards, with the rest being relatives of wizards and a few aristocrats that had found ways to attain their status without ties magic. Additionally, priests comprised a special, restricted social class.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On more than one occasion, instances of planar travel occurred between Glantri and Aebrynis , another world in the multiverse that had interactions with Toril .</p>
<p>At some point in history, some magical item was stolen from the planeswalking Faer没nian wizard Elminster and brought to Glantri. Elminster would visit the city briefly to steal this item back, resulting in a violent altercation.</p>
<p>At another point, a Oerthian planeswalking wizard Mordenkainen visited Glantri, immersing himself in its Great School of Magic and visiting its Great Library. While there he studied the Nithian Empire, a lost Mystaran civilization, and traded a rare book of Faer没nian lore to the head librarian in exchange for a Mystaran tome. Mordenkainen would later gift this book to Candlekeep 's Keeper of Tomes, eliciting a gleeful response.</p>
<p>In the month of Eleasis , of the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , government officials in the Faer没nian city of Ravens Bluff called for mages from the city's Ministry of Art to verify the authenticity of mithril coins that were said to have come from Glantri, a non-standard form of coinage in that nation. The coins came from a mammoth tax payment done by the House of Desires to Ravens Bluff. Their authenticity was confirmed, but the presence of some minor enchantments placed on the coins was also discovered by Oracle , the recently reinstated Minister of Divination. This event was later reported on in the Ravens Bluff Trumpeter under the headline "Record Taxes Paid by Merchant House".</p>
