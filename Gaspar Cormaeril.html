<p>Gaspar Cormaeril was a young member of the Cormaeril noble house of Cormyr in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Gaspar met with High Wizard Vangerdahast to discuss the appointment of Vangerdahast as regent. Gaspar agreed to give his support on the conditions that Vangerdahast appointed a council of a dozen or so noble houses, mostly at Gaspar's selection, with the voting power to overrule Vangerdahast himself, and that Vangerdahast's own vote would be directed by the Cormaeril house. Gaspar then assumed control of the house by having Ohlmer Cormaeril assassinated, and also had Sorgar Illance assassinated.</p>
<p>Gaspar was himself killed later that year by Aunadar Bleth to power the abraxus as part of the abraxus affair .</p>
