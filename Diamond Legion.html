<p>The Diamond Legion was a longstanding civic organization of the city of Procampur that served as both its city watch and military for over a millennium, becoming a higly trained and professional fighting force that was the envy of other city-states in Faer√ªn .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Most citizens of Procampur spent at least two, but often times up to four, years in service to the city as a member of the Diamond Legion. The organization had no gender restrictions, allowing many women to join and serve with distinction.</p>
<p>The Diamond Legion was divided up into several branches, including naval, air, artillery support, magical support, and a Reserve Corps. Their air division was known as the Eagle Riders .</p>
<p>The Legion included a number of ranks, with such titles as Lieutenant, Captain, Sergeant Captain, Sergeant Major, and the leading title Chief of Staff. Officers as low as lieutenants had the authority to deputize citizens.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Diamond Legion was responsible for maintaining law across all of Procampur, maintaining vigilance against any form of crime. Starting around the 1360's DR , the Legion ceased to have oversight over the city's Nobles District , with it falling under the exclusive purview of the newly formed Guardians of the Star Sapphire . This state of affairs was reversed around 1372 DR with the disbanding of the Guardians.</p>
<p>The Diamond Legion closely monitored travel between Procampur's districts. Out of all the districts, they were most present in the Port District .</p>
<p>If a Legionnaire ever suffered a debilitating injury that would interfere with their line of work, they would be given an honorable discharge.</p>
<p>One of the least glamorous duties of the Diamond Legion was to join the city's Dreaded Harbinger in parading criminals through the public streets. They did so in groups of eight, with two holding the chains that bound the prisoner.</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>Legionnaires were noted for upholding a courteous demeanor to both Procampans and visitors alike, though they would react accordingly if they ever felt that their kindness was being taken for granted. Due to their diligence they would often stop citizens they didn't recognize or just found suspicious.</p>
<p>Those operating in the Port District had a tendency to look the other way when it came to matters that didn't concern Procampur or its citizens. Whenever fights broke out in the district, unless the combatants were armed with weapons Legionnaires wouldn't intervene, but instead let the brawl run its course. Then once all those involved in the brawl were tuckered out, the Legionnaires would move in to apprehend them.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The organization was based in several Diamond Legion Branch Offices, or LBOs, across Procampur. One was located near the entrance of each city district. For districts with two entrances, such as the Port District, there were two offices. Additionally, the Port District Tower served as a station for the Legion. And they had a special barracks in the Castle District .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Legion worked closely with the city's Proctors in investigating crimes and mediating simple conflicts.</p>
<p>The organization's relations with the Procampan public were quite well. Older children and young men were strongly encouraged to join up as squires, as Procampans viewed service as a right of passage into adulthood, a place where one could learn of duty and responsibility. Men who failed to serve time in the Legion were seen as irresponsible, to both themselves and their community, as well as unfit to raise a family. As for Procampan women, many young women who did not join up with the Diamond Legion itself instead volunteered at programs that helped to maintain it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Diamond Legion had been around as an institution in Procampur since circa -230 DR , back when it was the site of Proeskampalar . Going as far back as the proper founding of Procampur in 523 DR , the Diamond Legion's office corp included members of House Grimm , one of the city's founding noble houses. Over the next millenia, the Legion would develop a reputation for being nearly undefeated.</p>
<p>Around the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , the city-state of Sembia attacked Procampur and tried to siege its walls with a plentitude of siege ladders , catapults , and trebuchets . During this conflict almost the entirety of the Diamond Legion were stationed on the city's walls.</p>
<p>Around the 1360's DR, the well respected and competent young officer Alaric Grimm led a rescue mission into an mine shaft on the outskirts of Procampur. The tunnel proved to be unstable and collapsed upon the company of Legionnaires, trapping them there for several days. By the time he was rescued Alaric had lost 20% mobility in his left leg and peripheral vision in his left eye, both of which were too far gone for restorative magic to fix. Alaric received an honorable discharge and bitterly moped for the proceeding few months. Then one day he discovered a scroll within the Grimm family library that was a charter for the Guardians of the Star Sapphire, a defunct private guard for Procampur's Nobles District. He brought this to his father, who then approached the Thultryl Rendeth of the Royal Blood about reviving the group. On the advice of his Hamayarch , Alamondh , the Guardians were commissioned to guard the Noble's District, with Alaric acting as their commander.</p>
<p>Around the month of Flamerule , in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , a plague broke out in Procampur's District of the Poor and the Diamond Legion's Reserve Corps were activated to contain it.</p>
<p>Some months after this, a failed assassination attempt on Thultyrl Rendeth led to the outbreak of another plague. With the city's ruler out of commission, Hamayarch Alamondh was forced to become Acting Thultyrl. In his first act as Thultyrl, Alamondh disbanded the Diamond Legion, arguing that they had failed in their job at protecting the Thultyrl and in keeping Procampur free of Sembian agents. This decision struck Procampans by surprise. Following their disbanding, the Legion's commanding officers went missing. In the first month without their diligent patrols, crime surged in the city and the new plague was running rampant in the streets. Then on an early afternoon in the month of Uktar , Alamondh decreed from the balcony of Thultyrl's Castle that the Guardians of the Star Sapphire were to be charged with filling the void, earning great applause at the time from the beleaguered citizenry. This newly expanded law enforcement agency acted as Alamondh's instruments in instituting his authoritarian regime, conducting mass arrests of both criminals and any opposition to Alamondh's rule, cracking down on both the Fraternity of Venturers and Society of Entertainers and Providers as alleged dissident hotbeds of criminal activity. These recriminations would be used to further justify the disbanding of the Diamond Legion over alleged incompetence.</p>
<p>The Thultyrl's fiance, Alissa Wyndsong , sometime after being branded a criminal by Alamondh broke into Thultyrl's Castle and ferried her ailing lover away to the city of Ravens Bluff , hoping with proper care and supervision he could recover. Eventually, the sword of Thallastam was discovered and hidden inside of it was found to be a cure to Rendeth's illness. At last free of his illness, Rendeth led the remaining loyalists of the Diamond Legionnaires in an assault against Procampur to retake the crown. Eventually their efforts win out and they discover that Hamayarch Alamondh had been dead for a long time, being no more than a puppet for the lich Cahoun .</p>
<p>With Rendeth returned to his place as the rightful Thultyrl of Procampur, he decreed that the Diamond Legion were to be reformed and the Guardians of the Star Sapphire were to be disbanded, with Legionnaires set to detain Star Guards for questioning. Additionally, all those who had been accused of crimes by the Guardians and imprisoned were to be pardoned. Rendeth initially offered Alaric Grimm reinstatement into the reformed Diamond Legion, along with the rank of Major, but the former leader of the Star Guards submitted himself to house arrest, hoping that the other members of his disbanded organization would follow his example and turn themselves in peacefully.</p>
