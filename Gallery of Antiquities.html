<p>The Gallery of Antiquities served as the treasury of Ysawis in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The gallery was found within the Jade Palace of the Necromancers , hidden behind a series of secret doors just inside the north wall of the palace near a private bathing pool.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The threshold to the treasury was warded with powerful symbols of insanity that would lash out at any intruder when they approached within 5 feet (1.5 meters). The symbols glowed malevolently, warning of their inherent danger. The interior of the treasury was observed by four skull watchers . Three of the watchers were in plain sight, but the fourth was cleverly hidden. Any of the skull watchers would emit an ear-piercing scream when an intruder was spotted.</p>
<p>The necromancer Kazerabet bound seven vile spectres to the treasury with powerful necromantic runes inlaid upon the floor, walls, and ceiling. The spirits were enraged by their forced servitude, having haunted the treasury for centuries before Kazerabet and Sumulael 's arrival, and vented their fury on any unlucky intruders.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kazerabet hoarded the riches of Ysawis within the treasury. Most, if not all, of the wealth accumulated here were transported from the city's catacombs by undead servants.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The wealth stored within the Gallery of Antiquities was legendary. In addition to many priceless works of art and jewelry, the gallery contained tens of thousands of ancient coins minted during the height of Ysawis' power. Even a single copper coin from this collection was worth up to 100 modern Zakharan dinar .</p>
