<p>Xainlaphar's flying skulls were grizzly explosive enchanted weapons created out of humanoid skulls.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Xainlaphar's flying skulls functioned in a manner similar to the skulltrap spell but offensively. These flying skulls could be unleashed to fly toward the enemies, where they exploded in magical flames and bone shrapnel, dealing grave damage to everything within four feet of the skull.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Xainlaphar , a mad Red Wizard , was known for turning the heads of his slain enemies into enchanted destructive weapons, later to be named Xainlaphar's flying skulls . Xainlaphar created a number of these skulls before dying in the Year of the Watching Raven, 913 DR , leaving behind more than half of the total number unused. Soon after, the flying skulls were claimed by Xainlaphar's enemies—a cleric and a paladin of Helm . The Helmites intended to destroy these foul weapons, but at least forty of them were stolen on the way to Sembia . Xainlaphar's legacy still existed as of the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR as one of these explosive skulls belonged to an exiled Arcane Brotherhood mage of Lonelywood named Kieran Nye .</p>
