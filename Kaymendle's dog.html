<p>Kaymendle's dog was an apparition created by Kaymendle Skrip , extant in Harrowdale in the 14 th century DR . It reacted to clouds, predicting rain.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The apparition resembled a fat war dog made of cloudstuff.</p>
<h2>Behaviour</h2>
<p>The dog mostly responded to incoming rain; it whined hours before light rain came, barked when typical summer rain clouds were approaching, and howled in advance of heavy rain.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kaymendle Skrip created Kaymendle's dog for the farmers of southern Harrowdale , expecting its barking would scare away storm clouds. It failed at that task, as the clouds ignored the dog. However, it remained until at least the 14 th century DR , when it was still visible over southern Harrowdale .</p>
