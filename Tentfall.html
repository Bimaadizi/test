<p>The tentfall was an experimental parachute conceived of by Nadul Da Roni while he developed other forms of powered flight.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In addition to the heartland flier , air screw , and doubles wheel , Da Roni put some effort into a device that would allow a common person to fall safely from a great height. According to his claims, any person with enough canvas could make it, in the form of a 12 yards (11 meters) square and 12 yd (11 m) tall pyramidal tent -like shape. The tricky part was apparently holding onto the large ring that hung from beneath the tentfall as it drifted downwards.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue listed the design by Nadul Da Roni, though it seemed to be a non-saleable item, instead intended to instruct others in the creation of their own tentfalls.</p>
