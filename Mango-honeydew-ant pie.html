<p>Mango-honeydew-ant pie was a pastry delicacy made with, as expected, mangos , honeydew melons , and jungle ant meat, baked by the Simbuki tribe of the Living Jungle , later known as the Tribe of Big Chief Bagoomba .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Great Change, or the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , the Simbuki tribe hosted the annual Festival of Chief Booda . One of its many friendly competitions was ran by the shu named Yako . His eating contest had no prize but offered its winners bragging rights. Yako's signature mango-honeydew-ant pies were the object of the competition. Each contestant was to announce the number of ant pies they were intended to eat, and the winner was to finish the entire set and beat the previous year's champion named Shimok .</p>
