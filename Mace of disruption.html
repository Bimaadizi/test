<p>A mace of disruption was a weapon that could utterly obliterate undead by disrupting the reanimation magic and evil affected beings of the lower planes .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A +1 mace , on impact, could destroy undead and lower-planes beings. Lesser undead such as skeletons , zombies , ghouls and ghasts , shadows , and wights were instantaneously blasted into non-existence. Greater undead could resist this effect, such as wraiths , mummies , spectres , vampires , ghosts , liches , in order of resilience, with evil lower-planes beings hardest to destroy, but even if they resisted, their injuries twice as severe as they would be normally.</p>
<p>The weapon bore a neutral good nature and powerful enchantments. Just touching it caused an evil being harm.</p>
<p>Maces of disruption could be created with varied power levels. Lesser maces of disruption had the ability to slay undead upon a successful hit and produced bright yellow light. Maces of disruption with a +8 enchantment were considered the most powerful variety, they were extremely effective when wielded against the undead and could almost certainly slay them upon a successful strike.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Maces of disruption were popular among clerics of Lathander for their undead-slaying powers. One such cleric was captured as he attempted to infiltrate Thay . Szass Tam himself flayed the cleric alive as cautionary example for others and reanimated the husk as a zombie servant.</p>
<p>In 1369 DR a mace of disruption could be found within the lair of a vampire Bodhi under Athkatla 's cemetery. Same year dwarven smith in Athkatla, Cromwell , knew how to increase the weapon's effectiveness by coating it with illithium , making it a +2 enchanted weapon.</p>
