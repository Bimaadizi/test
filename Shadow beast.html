<p>Shadow beasts were a class of outsider native to the Plane of Shadow . They included the four-armed, cat-like ghirrash ; the ferocious crocodilian khumat ; and the powerful elephantine thaskor . Shadow beasts were sometimes called fiends , but this was a misconception.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Shadow beasts, unlike the fiends for which they were sometimes mistaken, were not necessarily evil. They ranged in outlook from the chaotic ghirrash, to the dim-witted but evil khumat, to the lawful and cruel thaskor.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>All shadow beasts possessed darkvision . They spoke the Abyssal language , the Common language, and the Infernal language . Additionally, shadow beasts were immune to poison and resistant to attacks that utilized fire, lightning, cold, or acid.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Shadow beasts were natives of the Plane of Shadows, where they served various more powerful creatures, such as cloakers , dread wraiths , nightshades , and humanoids that lived there. They typically worked as soldiers.</p>
<p>Shadow beasts were sometimes found on the Material Plane in the service of their masters, or as mercenaries.</p>
<p>Among themselves, the shadow beasts did not fight each other, but also refused to work together in the same company. While on the Material Plane, however, they were known to cooperate; khumats in particular were better at working with either ghirrashes or thaskors.</p>
<h2>Notable Shadow Beasts</h2>
<p>By early Eleint of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , a khumat and the ghirrash Jherremor were aiding the church of Shar at the Lost Refuge in the Vast Swamp in the Material Plane and at the Shadow Citadel in the Shadow Swamp in the Shadow Plane. They were presumed to have been slain when adventurers in service to Mystra assaulted these compounds.</p>
