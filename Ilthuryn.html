<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ilthuryn attempted to court the infamously wealthy and haughty Lady Alauthshaee, but she scornfully rejected him. Enraged, Ilthuryn attacked her with his spells as she rode in her flying carriage. It reportedly crashed to earth within Dead Tree Hollow in the Vast . Ilthuryn then using his magic to bury the carriage, the guards, and Alauthshaee herself alive. This took place a very long time before the 14 th century DR , but still within elven memory.</p>
<p>An apparent side-effect of Ilthuryn's reckless spellcasting was a dead-magic zone over the whole valley that was still there by 1370 DR .</p>
