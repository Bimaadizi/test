<p>Ilthan was an island in the Pirate Isles in the Sea of Fallen Stars .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>There were several harbors on the island, mainly situated along the southern edge. There were no major settlements, as the storms that occurred during the winter were so severe they tended to destroy most buildings.</p>
<p>The most prominent feature of Ilthan was a city, built of stone and fallen into ruin, that stood in the center of the island, forming its highest peak, and was built for creatures much larger than humans and cyclopskin .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Cyclopskin claimed the northern edge of Ilthan, herding sheep and goats , but lived on the southern shore inside of high cliff caverns. Some were known to keep minotaur lizards as both pets and guard animals.</p>
<p>Pirates tended to live in small communities on the southern edge of the island, departing to Dragonisle whenever the winter season came. They largely left the cyclopskin alone, considering the dearth of adequate harbors on Ilthan's northern shore not worth the trouble.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>According to legend, whoever once lived in Ilthan's ruined stone city had dominated the Sea of Fallen Stars, but were destroyed by vengeful gods.</p>
<p>Rumors said that the cyclopskin who inhabited the island were lorded over by a small band of ettins .</p>
