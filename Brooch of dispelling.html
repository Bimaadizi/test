<p>A brooch of dispelling was a magical brooch which contained powerful dispelling magic. In the Year of the Slaying Spells, 976 DR , the mage Umbeso attempted to use such a brooch, made of fine silver over onyx , which he had acquired from a Calishite magic dealer many years before, to cancel the magic of the Evise Jhontil . unsuccessfully; though the backlash did not kill him, it destroyed the brooch.</p>
