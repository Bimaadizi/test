Some said she was locked away in the depths of the earth after murdering a vengeful mage 's niece, while others repeated a more romantic story of how Suhailah fell in love with a noble from the land of the Red Wizards – Thay , and later was forced into hiding. Even though her final fate remained unrecorded, Suhailah el Khaba was gone, leaving behind numerous various items she used in her career.
