<p>Brimstone Speakers were divine casters that saw truespeak as a gift from their gods. They blended divine magic with truespeak in a way that allowed them to breathe flame, and to summon celestials , in their unending quest to purge all evil.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>A brimstone speaker's signature ability, the first one they uncovered, was an utterance such that it granted them a tongue of flames which scoured 20 feet (6.1 meters) straight ahead of them with fiery power. The next ability they mastered was the heavenly entreaty ; while at first, it was lesser, fetching only the aid of a Bralani eladrin, with increasing mastery they gained the ability to summon word archons or ghaele eladrins , and finally an astral deva . Alongside their increasing mastery, they developed a harder-burning tongue of flames .</p>
<p>Their practice of the Power lagged somewhat, and one who pursued the path to the end would likely never achieve its strongest spells.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Brimstone speakers were common in the churches of Lathander and more rarely Kossuth . Common starts as brimstone speakers came from a prospective speaker's superiors noticing they combined zealotry with scholarly patience, and being taught the truename of the tongue of flames ; from there, they were expected to balance both pursuits themselves. They generally operated from small organizations within their churches, rarely being there organizations of brimstone speakers operating on their own.</p>
