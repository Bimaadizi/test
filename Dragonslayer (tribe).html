<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Dragonslayer tribe was known to live in the Vast Swamp around 1367 DR .</p>
<p>They had claimed the credit for slaying several black dragons over the decades. The last kill they claimed was of Tyra . The victorious Dragonslayers then moved into her lair.</p>
<p>However, Tyra's brother Despayr had a dream of her death to the Dragonslayers, and of her unguarded hoard. Following his visions, Despayr came to Tyra's lair, massacred many of the lizardfolk, and enslaved the survivors. He then took her lair and hoard as his own. He had a daughter by one of the lizardfolk, Ketsarra Shadowscale , who became their new chieftain. In time, Despayr was visited by Esvele Graycastle , who retrieved from the treasure the shadow shard . With this, Despayr transformed the lizardfolk slaves and even his daughter into the first of the undead Shadowscales . The Dragonslayers were no more.</p>
