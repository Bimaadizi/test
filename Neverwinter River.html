<p>Neverwinter River , known to the ancient dwarves as Nethlur , was a major river in the Sword Coast North of northwest Faer√ªn that flowed through the city Neverwinter . Its source was at Mount Hotenow and it emptied into the Bay of Mists on the Sea of Swords .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Neverwinter River's bright waters ran warm throughout the year, and many believed this feature was thanks to the heat produced by Mount Hotenow. Keeping the Neverwinter Wood area warm, it was the river that prevented the city of Neverwinter or its harbor from freezing during the winter.</p>
<p>Three bridges once spanned the river in the city Neverwinter: the Sleeping Dragon, the Winged Wyvern, and the Dolphin, each sculpted in the form of its name. Following the eruption of Mount Hotenow in 1451 DR , only the Winged Wyvern remained functional until Lord Dagult Neverember ordered the full reconstruction of Neverwinter in the late 1480s DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>As it flowed through Neverwinter Wood, the river was fed by Berun's River , Edal's Creek , the Gibdraw , and the River Morgur .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Many believed the city of Neverwinter was named for the persistent heat in the river that provided warmth regardless of the season. The River District in the city was also named for the Neverwinter River.</p>
<p>When Mount Hotenow erupted, dark ash choked the river for months before it was able to flow properly.</p>
