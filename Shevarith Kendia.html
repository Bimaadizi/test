<p>Shevarith Kendia was a Rashemi wizard and adventurer who operated out of Waterdeep during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The human wizard wore a hood over her auburn hair, and mainly dressed in white, and sometimes cyan and red. She often complimented this outfit with a mask, and its hood was often furred. She was said to show typical Rashemi pride, such as that of Minsc .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Shevarith had been likened to the winds of Rashemen: she was a cold, stubborn, and driven spellcaster with something to prove. She threw herself into her studies of the arcane with the goal of becoming a generalist, and sought to be ready for any challenge.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Shevarith owned several magic items, such as the Claws of the Owl (her Rashemi magic boots), the Mask of the Owl (her enchanted face mask), a ring of spell power , an abjurer's necklace , a pair of arcane dice , and the vial of revenge , a powerful potion of her own creation. She possessed several spellbooks and arcane tomes, including her personal grimoire .</p>
<p>She was armed with staves and wands . Some of the other weapons of choice for Shevarith were her wand of the war mage , staff of icy touch , green ceremonial kris , a wand of lightning bolts , and the staff of fiery wrath that once belonged to the Cult of the Eternal Flame . She was also gifted with the Dagger of Lasting Memory , the seal of readiness , and the Winter's Mask by Laeral Silverhand .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Shevarith's magic was inspired by her native Rashemen. She was a prolific maker of enchanted items and a potent spellcaster. In combat, she released strange and surprisingly powerful spells with seemingly simple gestures, often leaving her enemies and allies alike in disbelief. She was known to prepare spells such as darkness , disintegrate , fire storm , gust of wind , hold monster , ice storm , lightning bolt , poison spray , power word, stun , ray of frost , scorching ray , shield , witch bolt .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She was known to work for Waterdeep's Open Lord , Laeral Silverhand , and regarded as allies her adventuring companions: Halbenet Soladonel , Naomlen Girdaur , and Tommus Tallstep . She was at least loosely affiliated with the Wychlaran .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As a young girl in Rashemen , she once watched an owl paralyze its prey with fear using a terrifying screech. This resonated with her, and as an adult she adopted the symbol of the owl to remind her to command similar power over her foes.</p>
<p>She later set out for Waterdeep to become an apprentice of the Blackstaff , Vajra Safahr . However, she was too proud, and so did not ask Vajra directly. Instead, she wished to impress the archmage by helping Open Lord Laeral Silverhand's band of adventurers accomplish feats across the city and surrounding region, and hoped that this would gain her an invitation to become an apprentice of the Blackstaff. In service to Laeral, she and Halbenet Soladonel were among those who assaulted Sharpstone Keep to battle the threat of the Burntbone Horde , an army of bandits that threatened the roads around Waterdeep.</p>
<p>At some point she succeeded in gaining acceptance to Blackstaff Academy , and was acknowledged by Vajra as one of her exceptional pupils.</p>
