<p>Lesser Oblivion was a powerful magical scepter —an imitation of Shar 's Rod of Oblivion —found in Wheloon Prison in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The scepter was a heavy wooden rod fitted with golden embellishments and a large purple gemstone at its head.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Lesser Oblivion offered powerful boosts to the caster when they used negative energy and poison -related spells, and made them more open to the void for good or ill. Undead and others who regenerated from consuming negative energy would enjoy this, while the living found their ends approaching quicker. As well as granting an implicit understanding of life-force and healing, the scepter could also be used as a heavy club if needed.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The scepter was a pale imitation of Shar's own, and could have been found in Darstil's Tower in Wheloon Prison , after the mad wizard Darstil Vurusk was slain by the Riverside Rats . Despite possessing this holy item and being part of a Sharran gang, Darstil had little personal appreciation for Shar.</p>
