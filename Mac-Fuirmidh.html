<p>The College of Mac-Fuirmidh ( pronounced : / m æ k ˈ f ɜːr m ɪ d / mæk-FUR-mid ) was a traditional bardic college from the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The Mac-Fuirmidh cittern , one of the Instruments of the Bards , was named after this college and had been created by the legendary bard Falataer to test and reward his students who achieved mastery of the second level, or Mac-Fuirmidh level, of skill in his bardic college. The powers of the original Mac-Fuirmidh citterns could only be properly wielded by bards of at least the Mac-Fuirmidh college: bards of lower levels of skill could only obtain limited results.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The College of Mac-Fuirmidh was one of the seven elder bardic colleges dating back to Falataer, who had established it as the second level of his bardic college. Following this tradition, bards studying to obtain the rank of Magna Alumnae attended all seven colleges, with Mac-Fuirmidh being the second, after Fochlucan and before Doss . However, this practice was abandoned once the original colleges declined.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>Danilo Thann was taught on how to play the harp by a bard trained in the Mac-Fuirmidh playing style.</p>
