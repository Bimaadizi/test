<p>The golden eggs of Ghastar were a collection of powerful magical items created in Tabot in ancient times.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They were nine golden eggs , each of them unique and not all of them gold . They took the form of eggs, of course, adorned with animals or inlays and fashioned from precious metals, stones, and gems .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Each egg had its own distinct magical power, usable only by a monk or shukenja of lawful nature and moderate to high ability. The powers of the extant eggs were as follows:</p>
<p>The five lost eggs were thought to be equally powerful, but the information was lost to history.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The nine golden eggs were crafted by artisans of ancient Tabot, long before the coming of the lamas in Shou Year 585 (−665 DR) . Even their original name seems to have been lost—Ghastar was only the last man known to have possessed all nine.</p>
<p>Over the centuries, however, the eggs became scattered and five of them were lost. By Shou Year 2600 (1350 DR) , the four remaining eggs were held by the lamas at Pokarr Gompa . When Rokstang was inundated by a great flood in Shou Year 2601 (1351 DR) , the Abbot of Pokarr, Mo Kin , used the ruby-snake egg to stop the flood and save the city.</p>
