<p>Hrakhamar was a dwarven forge-complex built within a volcanic chasm in the land of Chult . While it was abandoned for some time, and attracted new residents, it remained a focal point for the local Chultan dwarves .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The complex was located in the Valley of Lost Honor , south of the Kobold Mountains , on the western side of Chult.</p>
<p>The southward tunnels of Hrakhamar continued 40 miles (64.4 kilometers) away to the Wyrmheart Mine , north of Shilku Bay .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Hrakhmar was used to smelt down and forge iron and adamantine taken from nearby mines.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>While the dwarves of Chult originally built Hrakhamar, they were forced to leave their forge when eruptions from the nearby volcanoes became too severe.</p>
<p>Some time later a herd of Imix -worshiping firenewts took up residence and re-activated the forge. They captured and imprisoned what dwarves they found, to learn as much as they could about its workings.</p>
<p>Some local Chultan dwarves watched and bode their time until their numbers were strong enough to rescue their comrades and take back their former home.</p>
