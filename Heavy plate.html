<p>Heavy plate armor was a form of full plate armor designed for maximum strength at the cost of immense weight.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The armor was an heavily reinforced version of full plate, combining the complete personal coverage of an expertly-crafted suit of armor with unusually thick plating. This made it extremely heavy and thus it was only made by very strong humanoids such as orogs . The advantage of this over-building was unparalleled physical protection, though at the cost of reduced agility.</p>
