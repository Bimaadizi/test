<p>The Forbidden Plateau was a high plateau lying beside a glacier in the Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains of the Yehimal , in the Utter East of southeast Faerûn . It was the site of the Kingdom of Nix .</p>
<p>The only way to reach it was through the elusive Phantom Pass , but even then, Nix only appeared once a year, around harvest-time. Vanesci Hamlet , a human settlement, lay near the entrance in Konigheim , many miles from Nix.</p>
<p>The almost-alien landscape around Nix was covered in slabs of gray stone and greenish swamps dotted with ponds. The trees were weirdly formed, with tendril-like branches and above-ground roots.</p>
