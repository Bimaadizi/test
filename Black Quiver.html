<p>The Black Quiver was a quiver from the ancient Imaskari Empire . As of 1360Â DR , it might have been found within the Star Houses of Solon.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Black Quiver held but one magical , black arrow within, which would be replenished immediately once drawn. Anyone struck by the arrow would suffer one of four unforgiving curses . The target could be prevented from using magic for a day, paralyzed without recourse for perhaps an hour, slain outright, or even explode. However, every time one of its arrows was shot, the archer's hand blackened and stiffened permanently, reducing their dexterity.</p>
