<p>Jesters' Clubhouse was the guildhall of the Waterdhavian guild known as the Jesters' Guild .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Jesters' Clubhouse was located at the corner of Pressbow Lane and Shrimp Alley , in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>This guildhall stood only a single story tall. Above the exterior entrance to the building was the likeness of a jester's head.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1357 DR , the group that would later be known as the Jester's Guild robbed the corpse of a jester from the past century, Myyrth , from the Anteos family crypt in the City of the Dead and brought it to the clubhouse as part of a plot planted in their minds by the Musicians' Guild . A plot that their then-guildmaster Bazzle referred to as the greatest "practical joke" the city had ever seen.</p>
<p>On that same night the jesters went on to confront and knock out the heroes of Selûne's Smile in the City of the Dead, as they had been looking into their graverobbing on behalf of the ghost of Myyrth. They then brought the unconscious adventurers back to the Jesters' Clubhouse.</p>
<p>In front of the adventurers, the jesters relayed their plans before proceeding to cast a combination of spells on Myyrth's corpse, each having been memorized by one of the members beforehand. This process reanimated his skeleton , imbued it with a number of offensive spells — flame breath , frost breath , and withering gaze — and expanded it to such a gargantuan size that it broke through the clubhouse. One of the jesters then remarked that they probably should have conducted their plan outside of the building, before Myyrth's skeleton walked off and started wreaking havoc in the city.</p>
