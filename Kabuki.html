<p>Kabuki was one of the two prevalent forms of theater in the island nation of Wa .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kabuki productions tended to be vigorous and exciting performances with elaborate song and dance. It was forbidden for women to participate in the shows; all actors were male.</p>
<p>Kabuki plays tended to be less serious than noh plays, which were the other common theatrical form of Wa. Unlike the epicly long noh performances, a typical kabuki show might only last a couple hours.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Some of the nobles of Wa found kabuki shows unbecoming or even obscene, such as daimyo Matasuuri Ieysuna , eldest son of the shogun Matasuuri Nagahide . On the other hand, daimyo Matasuuri Unteki , the shogun's brother, not only enjoyed kabuki but also cast himself in the major roles!</p>
<h2>Locations</h2>
<p>Large theaters where kabuki shows might be performed included the cities of Uwaji , Semmishi , and Iiso . One of the most famous of noh theaters, the Grand Noh Theater in Aru , also staged kabuki performances.</p>
