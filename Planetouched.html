<p>Planetouched was a general term used to described mortal creatures whose lineages traced back to an outsider of some kind, causing them some unusual characteristics that persisted in the bloodline for several generations. Planetouched were not as dramatically different as a true hybrid (i.e. a half-celestial or half-fiend) would be. The most common types of planetouched were tieflings and aasimar. However, there were no "typical" planetouched, as the different types generally lacked cultures of their own and instead adopted the culture they were born into.</p>
