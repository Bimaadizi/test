<h2>History</h2>
<p>Felix was a member of the Citadel of Assassins , a group closely allied with Zhengyi the Witch-King of Vaasa .</p>
<p>During the Vaasan War of the 1350s DR, Felix infiltrated the Damaran army and served as chief lieutenant to the young King Virdin during his campaign against Zhengyi. It was widely believed that Felix betrayed Virdin in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , by making him believe that a fake magic wand would enable the Damaran army to cross the Ford of Goliad undetected, and when the king attempted this gambit, Zhengyi wiped out his forces. King Virdin himself was assassinated as he was watching his army's defeat, and it was further believed that Felix was also responsible for this deed.</p>
<p>Following Virdin's defeat and Zhengyi's conquest of Damara, Felix returned to the Citadel of Assassins and was given a minor leadership role within their bandit army. In 1358 DR , he commanded the Bloody Swords , an orcish infantry unit of the Fleet Brigade , and was tasked with collecting tributes from Bloodstone Village .</p>
