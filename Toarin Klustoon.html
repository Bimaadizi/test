<p>Toarin Klustoon was one of Calivar Murpeth 's people in Warmfires House during a night revel in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR . A woman they captured, Talantha , claimed she'd only helped the scribe Maervidal Iloster escape the revel after his poisoning because she was threatened by Blaeragh Ridranus , another Zhentarim slyblade. Toarin slew him after a brief struggle. She then fingered four other operatives as having helped Ridranus. Those were killed by fellow slyblade Taerach Thone ; Toarin became restless at that point, and demanded Talantha be more forthcoming, as he affected certainty Strabbin Stillcorn and Rungo Baerlan were not traitors. The woman soon revealed herself to be Storm Silverhand in disguise, and killed him.</p>
