<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Lover's first known owner was a Waterdhavian half-elven thief Fehll Brownbriars, notorious for his burglaries and romantic conquests. Fehll's reputation brought a small army of rivals and enemies, all of whom wanted to get their hands on the thief's enchanted knife. Eventually, Fehll Brownbriars was killed by a clever seductress who warmed her way to his heart and ended his life, to the thief's great surprise. The seductress's name was Prespera of Orlumbor , who claimed the coveted dagger and sold it to the highest bidder. After that, the Lover disappeared into the roll of years until it reappeared once again in the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , among the hoards of treasures inside the temple dedicated to Icasaracht the white dragon on the island in Lac Dinneshere .</p>
