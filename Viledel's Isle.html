<h2>History</h2>
<p>The island was claimed by the "Sea King" Viledel in the Year of the Tattered Banners, 1228 DR , who chose it because of its proximity to pirates with whom he was at war to claim control over the Korinn Archipelago. Forty years later, pirates sacked the island, killed Viledel, and scattered his followers. In the decades that followed, the location of the island was lost, and inhabitants of the Korinn Archipelago knew only that it lay somewhere in the west of the isles.</p>
