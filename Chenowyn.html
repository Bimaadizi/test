<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Chenowyn had spent most of her life in the form of a human orphan girl in the city of Zazesspur . In this form, she had red hair and amber eyes. She often dressed as closely in style to Zaranda Star as she could, wearing tight breeches , a linen blouse with deerskin laces, and soft boots the folded over at the top. She sometimes bound her hair back in a silver-colored ribbon.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Her mother, an amethyst dragon , had left her in a orphanage, and for years, she had no idea that she was in fact a dragon. Most thought she was cursed, because of her strange powers.</p>
<p>For a time, she worked as a stable hand for a hard master, trying to earn money so that she could hire someone to teach her in magic.</p>
<p>She was later adopted by Zaranda, who treated her like her adopted child and taught her how to control her magic.</p>
<p>It was during the battle against deepspawn below the city that Zaranda and Chenowyn discovered the latter was a ruby dragon.</p>
<p>In Eleasis of 1367 DR , Chenowyn, in dragon form flew off to the west with fellow amethyst dragon Nyadnar .</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>Zaranda named her first daughter Sybille Zaranda Rhinda Chenowyn Alisande Rhindaun partly in honor of Chenowyn.</p>
