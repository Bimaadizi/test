<p>Praulgar was a Zhentarim wizard of the mid-14 th century DR . He pretended to be a pot seller, Nargalarr , during his last mission.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He wore robes.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>As Nargalarr, he acted as a somewhat dim-witted man. In truth, he was a petty tyrant, hated by his guards.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He had a spell-shield of sorts that could block a dagger, but would be exhausted after blocking one. One of his spells created lingering, deadly green flames.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He had four guards with him. None of them liked him very much. Holvan and Brasker , in the same caravan, were fooled by his impression of a pot seller.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Praulgar joined Orthil Voldovan 's caravan heading from Scornubel to Waterdeep in late 1357 DR , shadowing Shandril Shessair , who was traveling in the same caravan; he posed as a pot seller. During a chaotic ambush upon the caravan, he attempted to deceive Shandril into trusting him, but he was slain mid-sentence with two successive thrown daggers while trying to convince her he was out to protect her. His guards later struck his corpse with swords given the opportunity.</p>
<p>Praulgar's slayer was in turn slain by Narm , per Hlael Toraunt and Korthauvar Hammantle , who were scrying on the events as they unfolded.</p>
