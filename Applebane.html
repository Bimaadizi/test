<p>Applebane was a tiny magic dagger that was made of steel .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This diminutive +1 weapon was owned by the halfling thief , Peliwen Redgrass .</p>
<p>The dagger got its name from the habits of its owner, who would bring a huge rocking chair with him on his journeys. Before setting off on important tasks, he would relax in his rocking chair, and eat apples with the dagger itself. This blade was so often used for eating apples, instead of for fighting enemies, that his companions joked that it was the bane of apples, hence the name Applebane .</p>
