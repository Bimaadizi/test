<p>Ghost elves , were a subrace of elves from another world. The once isolated, peaceful, and life-loving ghost elves were massacred by Lolth's drow in their once hidden cities to be sacrificed to the Spider Queen. Tricked by a disguised pit fiend calling himself Thule , the few remaining ghost elves were taken to the Nine Hells , where Thule revealed himself to be the Archduke Thulikazt .</p>
<p>They served as slaves and eventually were promoted to Thulikazt's elite troops and guards during a time the ghost elves now refer to as the Tempering . They were used to fight in the Blood Wars on Thulikazt's behalf for centuries, which proved to be the pit fiend's undoing. They managed tricked his power-hungry enemies into helping them kill the pit fiend, and escaped in the chaos. Finding their souls severed from the land had lead to an affinity for the ethereal plane, the ghost elves constructed portals to the Ethereal plane where they constructed new hidden cities.</p>
<p>Occasionally, bands of ghost elven adventurers have made forays onto Toril from the Ethereal Plane, but they have no major presence on the planet.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Originally looking much like their more common elven brethren, the ghost elves' time spent under the brutal control of Archduke Thulikazt changed them, giving them a more frail appearance, coupled with strange mirror eyes that lacked any pupils, whites, or irises. Their skin glows with a spectral sheen giving off a white candle light that makes them often mistaken as ghosts (hence their name). Grey hair and very pale skin are almost always present in ghost elves, though occasionally one will be born with the jet black hair of their ancestors.</p>
<p>Ghost elves are around the same height and weight as their elven brethren, though they look very frail to an unknowing eye, even by elven standards. They typical reach adulthood at around age 30, and live roughly 100 years less than other elves.</p>
<h3>Personality and Alignment</h3>
<p>The previously life-loving and peaceful race adopted an alof and neutral outlook over the centuries, often inclining them to do what has to be done in the given moment regardless of whether the act was considered good or evil. They never forgave the other elves for not coming to their aid against the drow slaughtering them, and hold that grude to this day. Ghost elves treat well with dwarves and humans, and prefer to give half-elves the benefit of a doubt, but they do not trust the intentions of half-orcs or halflings. Ghost elves that come across drow will go out of their way to defeat them by any means necessary. This cold distance tends the elves towards neutrality above all other alignments, though some rare ghost elven adventurers have been known to be chaotic good.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Building their cities on the Ethereal plane, ghost elves rarely give other races access to their strange cities, constructed with winding paths that go up and diagonally quite often. They cultivate plants from the material plane, brining in their resources through portals hidden away in the secluded forests of the material plane. Due to their long time in captivity, ghost elves tend to live in close quarters with each other.</p>
<p>Their long time spent in the horrid arenas in the Hells gave them a propensity for short swords and scimitars . Unlike most other elves, ghost elves do not use bows, as they tend to be of very little use on the ethereal plane due to the cloaking mist that coats the plane.</p>
<p>Ghost elves sometimes employed domesticated phase spiders , which could occasionally be found in their hidden cities, or out on patrols.</p>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>Ghost elves do not worship the elven pantheon of deities, which they abandoned during the Tempering for not coming to their aid. Instead, they adopted the faith of the few dwarves also held in captivity by the pit fiend Thulikazt, choosing to worship the dwarven god Moradin , specifically in his aspect of the Soul Forger. The ghost elves believe they have been molded and forged into tools for some yet unknown purpose. Instead of building temples, these elves tend to have quiet worship in their homes, often inviting other members to join.</p>
<h3>Language</h3>
<p>Ghost elves speak an old Elven dialect that is disused by modern standards, making it difficult to properly understand. Ghost elven borrows words and phrases from Infernal, especially ones related to magic and battle craft. Having lost their original alphabet in the time spent in the Hells, this language uses the infernal alphabet instead.</p>
<h3>Relations with Other Races</h3>
<p>While typically avoiding contact with other races and preferring to stay on the Ethereal Plane, they occasionally treat with dwarves and the sylvan folk who dwell in the forests which they build their portals. These sylvan rarely speak of the ghost elves, something for which the ethereal elves are grateful.</p>
<h2>Magical Powers</h2>
<p>A ghost elf's pale skin glows with the brightness of a candle in the dark, an ability they can willingly suppress with intention and concentration.</p>
<p>Due to the centuries the ghost elves spent in the Nine Hells , all ghost elves passed some form of innate magic power. Ghost elven magical abilities were somehow derived from their lack of connection to the land, discovered upon their escape after the Tempering.</p>
<p>Once per day, a ghost elf could involve their connection with the Ethereal Plane to produce an ability to produce effects such as allowing them to more easily slip their bindings, or See invisibility . The more powerful members of the race could even produce magic such as the Blink and Ethereal jaunt spells, while the most powerful among them could transport themselves directly to and from the Ethereal and Material plans using the a personal variation of Plane shift known as Ethereal Shift .</p>
<p>The less skilled members of their race relied on constructed portals to the Ethereal plane, typically hidden away in remote forests on the Material plane.</p>
