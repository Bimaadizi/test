<p>During one night of 1369 DR , Sharala was one of the priestesses dancing under Qilué Veladorn's guidance in an Eilistraeean rite which was interrupted by the arrival of the Harper Dove Falconhand , who sought Qilué for a task in Scornubel . After the priestess Ierembree tried to kill Dove, she was affected by one of the Harper's kisses, which involved some level of mind-melding. Sharala was quick to suggest, noticing her peer's placidity, that her wits may no longer be her own. Ierembree rebuffed the idea.</p>
