<p>Daranthur's Hall was a "shared-roof" market located in downtown Athkatla , in the nation of Amn , during the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The market was severely damaged during an attempt to uncover a smuggling ring within the city. Storl Thammuraster , Amaront of Selgaunt , and Onth Tarralus of Silverymoon used a gem -exploding spell to detonate the gems hidden in bottles, causing a series of explosions that killed dozens of traders and shoppers. After calling additional contacts, three merchant families—the Aerlonds , Kravalondurs , and Morornds —were exposed as smugglers.</p>
