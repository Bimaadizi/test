<p>The Polyandrium was a graveyard outside of Myth Drannor that was the site of an ancient battle between the forces of the invading orc horde and the defenders of Myth Drannor. The most notable feature of The Polyandrium was the monument commiserating the battle.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Polyandrium was located to the north from Myth Drannor, and further north-east from the graveyard stood the Shrine of Mystra . The north-western area of the Polyandrium crawled up a low hill. The central part of the site was speckled with shrubs.</p>
<p>The monument erected after that battle was situated in the middle of the clearing that was the Polyandrium. The memorial's base stone was carved out of a white-colored stone and rose 4 feet (1.2 meters) up and was a 12 ft² (1.1 m²) square. From the base, three tall marble warrior statues rose up, an elf , a dwarf , and a human . The trio was positioned in a triangle facing outwards with their weapons drawn.</p>
<p>The graveyard held a few larger tombs, big enough to serve full generations of the family, and a dozen of smaller-sized mausoleums that were built for individuals. Numerous grave markers littered the outskirts of the Polyandrium and stretched into the forest surrounding the site. Most of the tombs in the Polyandrium were protected by a combination of a glyph unique to the sealed area, and a word of power , unique to each glyph .</p>
<p>The Tower of Bones stood to the north from the monument, overlooking the Polyandrium. The tower was built, with many protests and outrage, during the Myth Drannor's golden age by necromancers who came to the city to study their art. The Tower of Bones' position outside of the city guaranteed the civil discourse and avoidance of conflicts.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The word "polyandrium" meant "the gathering place of fallen warriors". The name was given to this area following an ancient battle between the defenders of Myth Drannor and an orcish horde. The attackers maneuvered the defenders down one of the nearest hills and surrounded them spilling the blood of many valiant warriors. Eventually, the defenders of Myth Drannor persevered.</p>
<p>The Polyandrium became a site of the mass grave for the unidentified fallen defenders. Orcish fallen received a mass grave of their own not war from there. The Myth Drannor erected a monument on the site and with time, the area started being built up with tombs and mausoleums, becoming the secondary graveyard for Myth Drannor.</p>
<p>In 1369 DR , during the Cult of the Dragon 's occupation of the ruins of Myth Drannor, one of the Cult's cells was stationed out of the Tower of Bones in the Polyandrium. The Cultists used slave labor and the undead created using expired slaves and enemies to excavate the tombs on the graveyard. By the time a group of heroes pursuing the Cult's slavers arrived at the Polyandrium, about half of the tombs have been broken open and desecrated.</p>

<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR, the area was under the control of the Cult of the Dragon, they filled the graveyard with slave laborers of various races and the undead, such as skeletons , ghouls , ghasts , wights , and zombies . At night the polyandrium became a dangerous and scary area, filled with roaming undead awakened from the ancient mass-graves.</p>
<p>The Cult of the Dragon's operations in the Polyandrium was led by Ryngoth and his loyal awakened dire badger Zulkir .</p>
<p>Close proximity to the forest also meant the wild creatures often could be found in the area, such as trolls , giant wasps , giant spiders , and phase spiders .</p>
