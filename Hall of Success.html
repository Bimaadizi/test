<p>The Hall of Success was a temple of Waukeen in the Temple District of the city of Procampur in the Vast . It later became a temple of Lliira .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , it was led by High Priest Undil Latheen , However, Latheen went mad following the apparent death of Waukeen during the Time of Troubles of that year.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , the Hall of Success was reconsecrated to the goddess Lliira, whose church had been taking over that of Waukeen. The new high priest was Baniya Dolester , who also cared for the still-suffering Latheen.</p>
<p>In Marpenoth of 1367 DR, when Procampur was struck by the featherlung plague, Dolester worked with High Priest Orn Thavil of Tymora and set up auxiliary shrines in the District of the Poor to treat the sick there. Though their actions halted the spread of the disease, the Thultyrl reprimanded both high priests for breaking Procampur's district rules, and were reminded that the city and its laws were older than a number of deities.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In 1358 DR, high priest Undil Latheen led 33 priests and 69 lay-followers. He was succeeded by Baniya Dolester.</p>
<p>Bethany and Chantel De Villars of Ravens Bluff were priestesses of Waukeen who had their official residences in Procampur, and so were presumably attached to the Hall of Success. [ speculation ]</p>
