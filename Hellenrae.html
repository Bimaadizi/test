<p>Hellenrae was a high-ranking member of the Cult of the Black Earth during the Elemental Evil crisis.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Hellenrae simply hated everyone, even her fellow cultists, so she tried to avoid contact with others. She greatly despised weakness.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Hellenrae usually remained in her quarters unless orders came from Marlos Urnrayle .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In her youth, Hellenrae was an orphan who lost her sight. She was accepted by a monastic order , where was she trained as a monk , but she distorted the monks' philosophy of self-denial and emptiness of mind to extremes, seeking to fill herself with the dark power she sensed sleeping in the earth and rock around her.</p>
<p>So, instead, Hellenrae joined the Cult of the Black Earth and rose to become the chief lieutenant of Marlos Urnrayle .</p>
<p>In 1491 DR , Hellenrae, Qarbo , and their minions disguised themselves as monks occupying the Sacred Stone Monastery . Soon after, however, some adventurers infiltrated the monastery and in the end confronted and defeated Hellenrae.</p>
