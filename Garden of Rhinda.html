<p>The Garden of Rhinda was a luscious flower garden in Darromar at the base of and surrounding the Ithal Crag , the large hill upon which the queen's royal palace of Faerntarn was built.</p>
<p>The garden added color to the otherwise dull granite of the palace walls. To reach the palace, one had to pass along the winding road up the hill and through the garden.</p>
