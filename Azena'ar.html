<p>Azena'ar was a drider who operated the Underdark Arena for House Cay'Vorym in the 1480s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar , Azena'ar worked for House Cay'Vorym as they attempted to profit from the conflict. Using Djir Garpeth to advertise and recruit closer to the surface, Azena'ar had willing gladiators like Oolgnim the mind flayer and Hessperina the medusa , and kept enslaved surfacer fighters using drow slave collars . It was possible for a particularly adept and flashy team of contenders to defeat all comers and then challenge him as well, potentially leading to his death on the arena floor.</p>
