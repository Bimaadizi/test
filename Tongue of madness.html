<p>Tongue of madness was a fungus that grew in the Underdark . When mature, it resembled a large human tongue and was edible but somewhat poisonous. When consumed, any creature with the power of speech who did not have sufficient constitution to resist the mind-altering effects was compelled to speak his or her every thought for the next hour. This compulsion could be cured by a lesser restoration or similar spell.</p>
