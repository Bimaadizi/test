<p>House Dun'Robar was a notable Lolthite drow house of the city of Sschindylryn in the 15 th century DR . Of the city's houses, they were most renowned for their martial prowess and power.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Dun'Robar was famed in Sschindylryn for its martial focus. The house manufactured bespoke magical weapons that it sold to outsiders, as well as provided elite training for guards and soldiers throughout the city. Internally, Dun'Robar maintained a tradition of excellence in its warriors, with its estate more like a fortress than a home.</p>
<h2>Headquarters</h2>
<p>The estate of House Dun'Robar was located inside Sschindylryn proper, and was filled with well-armed house guards and traps . Much of its internal space was devoted to chambers for housing and training soldiers, as befitting their business.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Darkening in the mid-1480s DR, Dun'Robar joined an alliance with House Szind , House Avithoul , and several smaller houses in the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar , which was orchestrated by High Priestess Hekta Szind in an effort to find the Thread of the Weave on behalf of Lolth . The alliance was largely pushed by High Battlemaster Teblyn Dun'Robar , with most of the other influential house leaders having much less interest. As a result Matron Jyr Dun'Robar devoted her house's resources to the war, sending many soldiers to assault Eveningstar and secure the surrounding Underdark .</p>
<p>As part of the Cormyrean counterattack, Wizard of War Traegar Vadamore sent a team of daring adventurers into the depths of the Underdark to find and sabotage House Dun'Robar. Cloaked with powerful illusions disgusing them as drow servants, the surfacers found High Battlemaster Teblyn's personal weapon racks and contaminated them with a fast-acting rust monster ichor that destroyed the metal. They then moved to the estate's courtyard and rang a bell in challenge (potentially encountering Matron Jyr along the way), causing the Battlemaster to arrive in a furious state and attack them without his favored weaponsâ€”leading to his embarrassing defeat.</p>
<p>With Dun'Robar sabotaged and their Battlemaster slain by a group of mysterious drow in a public manner, the house was sent into an uproar even as their reputation for martial excellence suffered. Their suspicions of outside interference caused them to draw away from their Szind and Avithoul allies, greatly weakening the drow war effort. Just as Traegar Vadamore planned, this opened up a weakness in the drow defenses that allowed a later attack upon the Sschindylryn Ziggurat and the Temple of Lolth atop it.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>During the invasion of Eveningstar in the late 15 th century DR, the house included the following notable drow:</p>
