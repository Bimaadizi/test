Subsequently, caster's shield failed to defend its mistress as Janice died on the battlefield, felled by a stray arrow . Honoring her service and friendship, Janice's battalion returned the shield to the Whentom family.</p>
<p>Caster's shield remained with the Whentoms until sometime before 1372 DR . Eventually, the shield found its way into the old crypt underneath Gillian's Hill not far from Daggerford .</p>
