<p>Oparl was a town in the Border Kingdoms in the midâ€“14 th century DR . It was the main population center of Bedorn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It consisted of sixty large Calishite mansions, walled off with each having a good view of the rest of Bedorn , being situated on four high knolls.</p>
<p>Strangers were not welcome here. Injured persons were occasionally given some supplies but were otherwise forced off to the nearest source of water by the private security of the nearest mansion. There were two ways to get into one of the buildings in this town, either as an invited guest or as an invader who had defeated a small army of mercenaries, security guards, and trained or charmed monsters.</p>
<p>Buildings were ramshackle and frequently destroyed under their own weight due to poor building methods. Workcrews were thus almost continually hired to rebuild structures in an ever more gaudy and unfeasible fashion.</p>
