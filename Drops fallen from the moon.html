<p>"Drops fallen from the moon" was a name given to the holy essence of the goddess Selûne the Moonmaiden.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Some avatars of Selûne trailed dancing lights known as "moon motes" or "moondust". At other times, Selûne manifested as only a trail of these moon motes. The moon motes could occasionally exude these drops. They were also believed to rain from the Tears of Selûne , the satellites that trailed after the moon , hence the name. Such drops also sometimes fell from the replica Wand of Four Moons kept in the House of the Moon temple in Waterdeep by 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The drops formed a radiant, sparkling, pearly-hued liquid.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>Believing them to be gifts from the goddess, the Selûnite clergy collected these drops and valued them greatly. They were a powerful ingredient in many beneficial potions , unguents, and healing drafts and ointments. Such potions could grant infravision from sunset to sunrise or keep one awake through the night while still receiving the benefits of a full night's sleep.</p>
