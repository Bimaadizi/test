<p>Aeger was an infamous giant bear who terrorized the Sword Coast several centuries before the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Aeger was a dire menace to hundreds of small settlements on the Sword Coast several centuries before the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR . The powerful creature was invulnerable to fire, cold, and acid, while its touch skin made the bear well protected from mundane weapons. Eventually, the villages grew desperate and formed a militia of 200 men and women who slew Aeger. Only less than a dozen militia folk survived. The survivors skinned Aeger and shared its hide amongst each other. One of the pieces of the giant bear's skin was made into a unique piece of hide armor later known as Aeger's Hide .</p>
