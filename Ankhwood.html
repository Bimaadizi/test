<p>Ankhwood (once part of the Winterwood ) was a forest whose insect, animal and plant populations become mutated. There were once wild magic and dead magic areas orbiting one another in the forest, but by 1374 DR this effect had subsided and the elves living in the area were investigating the cause of the mutations.</p>
