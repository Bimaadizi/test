<p>Belaying pins were a type of mariner's tool.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Belaying pins were short rods of wood or metal that were inserted into holes bored through a ship's rail. The rigging lines of a ship would be fastened to them. They were usually found in rows, bringing a series of ropes together to one location. Alternatively, sailors would use belaying pins as a place to store their unused ropes.</p>
<p>Beyond their primary purpose, belaying pins could be yanked free and used as an improvised club . Typically this occurred during boarding actions at sea, when no other weapons were in reach or when a weapon was lost.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Belaying pins could be found on practically any ship. They were typically available for purchase at seaside towns or cities, particularly from shipbuilders, warehouses, or businesses that supplied ships.</p>
<p>In the port city Athkatla for example, the market Waukeen's Promenade sold belaying pins alongside other nautical equipment.</p>
