<p>Castle Felmorel was a castle in the mid–8 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The castle stood somewhere to the west of the village of Hammershaws .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The entrance was dark-paneled on the inside. There were brass lamps.</p>
<p>At least one guestroom was small but had a high ceiling, with old tapestries and a canopied bed, with candles for light set across the room. A room not far from there, used for rituals, had a glass-smooth floor. Nasmaerae's bedchambers were accessible through a secret path leading to the back of her closet.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Lord of the castle, Esbre Felmorel , was known to hold feasts with unexpected guests.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The gate usually sported three guards in the mid–8 th century DR ; as of 761 DR those guards included Glavyn and Feiryn . During the wee hours of the night, there was only one guard, who was called Bretchimus . Another man-at-arms present was called Errart . At least one chamber had protections built into the stone. By 767 DR , the Lord employed one or more mages capable of using spells.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In spring of the Year of Laughter, 761 DR , Elminster Aumar , a Chosen of Mystra , invited himself at the last minute to a feast at Castle Felmorel, over the objections of one of the guards, Glavyn; he used magic to disable the guard's upper limbs just before the man drew his weapons. Before the situation further degenerated, Lady Nasmaerae Felmorel witnessed the exchange and personally invited him to the feast.</p>
<p>The feast Elminster joined, hosted by Lord Esbre and Lady Nasmaerae, had two other guests of note: archmage Thessamel Arunder , and the warrior and explorer Barundryn Harbright . Before they joined, there were already a number of refreshments on the table, including whellusk , half-shell and all, and also soft cheese with spices . The main dishes included sauced venison, a three-serpent pie that was crusty, and a lizard soup with pepper , roasted boar , and spitted fowl. The archmage was cautiously suspicious about Elminster, who found much agreement with the explorer over the feast. While they knew nothing of Dasumia , the host and guests attested to a "Lady of Shadows" ruling nearby lands, with Thessamel being surprisingly quiet about her.</p>
<p>Lady Nasmaerae attempted to cast some spell to subsume Elminster's power or knowledge during the night, and found herself thwarted by Azuth 's warding over Elminster. As a warning, Azuth broke her spell-thrall over her husband and warned her that if she attempted that spell again, she'd lose all her spells. Esbre immediately forced her to recast the spell, resulting in the definitive loss of her powers.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of these events, Esbre Felmorel declared Azuth would be worshiped in his home henceforth. Elminster left before dawn, and the mage Thessamel Arunder followed him out.</p>
<p>During the brief period of spell failure in Year of the Awakening Wyrm, 767 DR , Lord and Lady Felmorel were still married, and Lady Felmorel was concerned about the loss of spells, though she hadn't regained her own use of magic.</p>
