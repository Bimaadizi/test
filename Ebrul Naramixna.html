<p>Ebrul Naramixna was the Lord Apprehender of Deep Imaskar in the late 14 th century DR.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Per Ususi Manaallin , messages from the Lord Apprehender sounded like a mix of threats and praise, with a call for help somewhere in them.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The Lord Apprehender had a painting of the Palace of the Purple Emperor in their office.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As Lord Apprehender, Ebrul Naramixna oversaw all information and resource gathering in the city, as well as the maintenance of city defenses.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Lord Apprehender was known to Ususi in 1363 DR , when she made accommodations to ensure Qari Manaallin was taken care of after Ususi's self-exile. Some of those accommodations required the trust of the Lord Apprehender. In the Feast of the Moon of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the Great Seal was partly broken on the initiative of the Lord Apprehender, with the tacit approval of the Lady Enacter. With Deep Imaskar besieged by Pandorym 's forces in early 1374 DR , Ebrul sent Iahn Qoyllor , an Imaskari vengeance taker to the surface in order to retrieve Ususi, believing that the origin of the forces besieging Deep Imaskar was in the Celestial Nadir .</p>
