<p>Wildfire was a peculiar wild magic phenomenon observed in the city of Ravens Bluff in the Vast in which an individual suddenly displayed the ability to use magic when placed in dangerous situations, albeit uncontrolled and in a chaotic fashion.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It manifested only once or twice a year in a small portion of the residents, known as wildfire-wielders. People who exhibited signs of wildfire were always native residents of Ravens Bluff who had no formal training in the arcane arts. The warlord Myrkyssa Jelan discovered the reason for this: a wild mythal , built by the dark elves below the city. The mythal's magic seeped into the air, earth, and water surrounding Ravens Bluff, and was the source of wildfire.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 1370s DR, Myrkyssa sought multiple times to conquer or seize control of the city of Ravens Bluff and thus exploit the wild mythal to aid her future conquests. In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , wildfire-wielder Jack Ravenwild foiled a plot by Myrkyssa to use the wild mythal to end the anti-magic curse that afflicted her.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Jack, the House of High Magic , a local mage guild, divined that Jack's wildfire would bring some sort of magical calamity (possibly the Spellplague ) to Ravens Bluff so they imprisoned Jack in magical stasis inside the mythal stone. He didn't escape until over a hundred years had passed.</p>
<p>The destruction of the wild mythal in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , resulted in Jack losing his magical abilities.</p>
