<p>Boots of starstriding were enchanted boots used by wildspace -farers and corsairs.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Boots of starstriding were ensorcelled to keep their wearers solidly within the gravity plane of any spelljammer , preventing them from floating away weightlessly. The boots allowed the wearer to leap from one gravity plane to another, and from one ship to another, without oscillating, despite being magically slowed down in the process. The success of such jumps depended only on the wearer's athleticism and jumping proficiency.</p>
