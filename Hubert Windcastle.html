<p>Hubert Windcastle was an aide to Lord Protector Dagult Neverember of Neverwinter in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Hubert sent messages to trusted human adventurers in the city to seek their help on matters benefiting Neverwintan citizens. He first requested they meet Scout Stone in Blacklake District and later the historian Retrigal Bookbinder in Neverdeath graveyard, and finally Ril Ironlance at the Chasm .</p>
<p>However, Hubert was forced to get involved in person after he possibly insulted one of Neverember's guests at dinner, he faced being sacked unless he could complete a vital task, and he could not find a capable go-between. Thus, he ventured to the Whispering Caverns of the Underdark , hired the same adventurer, and had them rescue the Elmheart family from a drow villa where they were enslaved. Afterward, while the adventurer held the drow off, Hubert led the Elmhearts to freedom. Presumably he would retain his job after that.</p>
