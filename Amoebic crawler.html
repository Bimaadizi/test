<p>Amoebic crawlers were a gelatinous species of ooze from the Far Realm .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Amoebic crawlers resembled large, translucent worms with two tentacles emerging from the "head." They derived from the fluid of the Amoebic Sea itself, and exuded a palpable dread as they crawled.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Amoebic crawlers were mindless creatures, but were voracious hunters.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Amoebic crawlers were difficult to spot, owing to their translucent color, and many an adventurer had accidentally walked into their acidic bodies. However, unlike a black pudding , the amoebic crawler could not corrode stone or metal, but only organic materials. Additionally, the crawler's ties to the Far Realm led them to exhibit some form of touch-based telepathy , allowing them to fill their victims with horrifying visions of their home plane and causing the victim intense psychic pain and nausea.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Amoebic crawlers would propel themselves toward a creature and lash out with their two lithe, acidic tentacles. If it managed to hit the creature, it could restrain its foe and begin an external digestion process, stripping flesh from bones in plain sight. The bodies of their victims were then incorporated into their mass.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Amoebic crawlers were often used by the kaorti , who used these oozes in their quest to reform the Material Plane .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the Imaskari wizards called the Quin returned from their millenia long sojourn in the Far Realm, they returned transformed into the Kaorti. With them they brought other creatures of that alien place, including amoebic crawlers. Other amoebic crawlers were later brought in through portals back to the Far Realm created deep in the Kaorti lairs.</p>
