<p>A ring of telekinesis was a magical ring that allowed the bearer to use the spell telekinesis at will.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>As the name suggested, the ring gave the wearer the power of telekinesis , allowing them to move items and creatures weighing up to 225 lb (102 kg). They could be moved with a gentle, sustained force, attacked in a variety of weighs, or hurled up to 90 ft (27 m) with great force. This last application could be applied to up to nine creatures or objects, but only to the limit of the mass.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The ring of telekinesis worn by Kilili was very large, consisting of a large round red gem in a gold setting. It emitted a pale orange beam that enveloped its target.</p>
<h2>Notable Rings of Telekinesis</h2>
<p>The drow magic-user Kilili possessed a ring of telekinesis . In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , she used it to rescue—and then capture—her sister Cybriana after she was dropped by a gargoyle en route to Imgig Zu 's tower. This ring remained with Kyriani , the result of a merger of Kilili and Cybriana. It returned to Kilili when the two later separated in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR . The wizard Parwyyd Hanifar stole the ring from Kilili and slipped it onto Cybriana's finger, giving the opportunity for the two to re-merge. The new Kyriani used the ring to close the Great Door with Parwyyd's aid. During the Time of Troubles later that year, Kyriani used her ring of telekinesis to hurl a table and then pots and pans at a false avatar .</p>
