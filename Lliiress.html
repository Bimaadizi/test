<p>Lliiress was a hidden town in Raurin , south and east of Gerinvioch 's lair. The town was isolated since its foundation, due to the dragon's use of an artifact, the Evise Jhontil .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The town of Lliiress was east of the tallest peak south of Gerinvioch 's lair, close to a rock about thrice the height of a man.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The town was surrounded by a barrier to about one mile away from the Evise Jhontil ; it could not be detected or seen from outside the barrier, nor could anything from inside the barrier get out. Once inside, there were brightly colored huts, all of them with thatched roofs.</p>
<p>The Evise Jhontil was kept in the center of town, floating and spinning about 60 feet (18 meters) from the ground.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Originally, Aniolon Gruanthe was to be the leader of the town. However, he died shortly after founding the town. By 1372 DR , Lliiress had no government, and even outsiders were not told what to do.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The town simply had no opportunities for trade, due to the barrier. Anything that could not be procured otherwise and was needed was brought into being sorcerously, killing the caster, and then stored as necessary. The occassional animal that wandered in from the desert provided for a meal that required no sacrifice, and sometimes, new people entered, mostly in groups of up to three. Once, in 1352 DR approximately, a large group of desert nomads joined the town.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>There was a barrier to about a mile around the town; anyone who crossed the barrier from outside became trapped inside, unable to leave. Due to the influence of the Evise Jhontil , all magic items that cast spells immediately broke down after use, and anyone who cast a spell was affected so that their lifeforce perpetuated the spell until it ran out, killing them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lliiress had been established in the Year of the Slaying Spells, 976 DR by Aniolon Gruanthe and many mages who followed him, including some clerics of Sharess and Lliira , trying to leave behind Estagund and its Rajah's mercenaries.</p>
<p>After the wizard made a deal with Gerinvioch , a local blue dragon , for protection, they settled close to his lair in the Raurin . The dragon employed a ritual and an artifact, the Evise Jhontil , in order to raise a barrier that would hide the town from all manner of prying. Secretly, he also made the barrier so that it would be impossible for anyone to leave, but not so to enter; the artifact also slew anyone in the town who cast a spell, using their lifeforce to power the magic until they ran dry.</p>
<p>The wizard Kinase Bronihim of Chavyondat entered the town in 1372 DR .</p>
