<p>Khelvos Dermmen was the Provisional Governor of Scardale in the late 14 th century DR . His duties included leading the Scardale Council that ruled over the realm, both of which were stationed a keep in Chandlerscross looking over the Ashaba .</p>
<h2>Rulership</h2>
<p>Khelvos was elected to replace Myrian Beechwood after the Shaking Plague devastated Scardale Town in 1370 DR . He and the council both opposed any attempts to maintain any semblance of the occupation of Scardale Town, in contrast to the other dales who wanted to limit the near-complete lawlessness found within its walls.</p>
