<p>The Dragonstail was a peninsula protruding from the Purple Hills in Tethyr in west Faer√ªn .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Dragonstail was low in elevation and described as serpentine, snaking out into the Sea of Swords . The town of Carathryn stood on its coast at the seaward end.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Shattered Chains, 1123 DR , the Teeth of Talos storms lashed the southern Sword Coast . The storms completely sunk the Dragonstail peninsula, taking Carathryn with it. In later years, both the Dragonstail and Carathryn were a hazard to mariners along the coast, by ripping open the hulls of passing ships.</p>
