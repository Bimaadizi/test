<p>Istishia ( pronounced : / ɪ s ˈ t ɪ ʃ i ɑː / is-TISH-ee-ah ) was the neutral primordial deity of elemental water and purification. While other powers governed oceans, pools, streams, storms, or simply those that had business with the water, Istishia was far more abstract. The Water Lord was mutable and dynamic, representing constant change with an essential constant at its core, the god not of any specific body or state of water, but the water itself.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Istishia was depicted in a wide variety of forms ranging from a drop of rain or ocean wave to a water weird or gigantic water elemental . When he manifested, it was as a 40​ to ​60 feet (12​ to ​18 meters) tall, 20​ to ​30 feet (6.1​ to ​9.1 meters) thick, column of water. This form maneuvered effortlessly over or through any obstacles in its path, its movements sounding like the surf pounding on the shore, and was known to divide into several parts in an effort by the Water Lord to confuse his enemies. When he spoke, his voice was at once the sound of rushing water, a babbling brook, and a gentle rain.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Istishia was a slippery, dispassionate power whose reasons and logic were incomprehensible to most. He provided an atmosphere for life and provided a vital resource, yet would not grant the life itself and cared not how his gifts were used. He was relatively aloof towards his own followers, ignoring and favoring them seemingly on a whim, so alien, uncaring, and utterly random that his unpredictability was itself predictable.</p>
<h2>Divine Realm</h2>
<p>Though Istishia did not have a court in the conventional sense, and despite his followers belief that he encompassed the whole Elemental Plane of Water , he did maintain a distinct divine realm on that plane within the Great Wheel cosmology called Sea of Timelessness .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Istishia had ties to deities with a relation to water, but no strong relationships. These included the likes of like Deep Sashelas , Eadro , Eldath , Persana , Shekinester , Surminare , Trishina , Umberlee , Valkur , and the Water Lion . Of these, he worked loosely with Sashelas, Trishina, and Eldath to maintain the life cycles of the sea. Conversely, he had no interest in Umberlee's storms or Valkur's sailors.</p>
<p>Istishia opposed Kossuth in every way. He sat back and watched the struggle of the archomentals of water, Ben-Hadar and Olhydra; presumably he would intervene if one would achieve a real chance to get control of elemental water.</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Istishia was worshiped by sailors, pirates, water Elementals, water genasi, some aquatic elves , and others who felt a bond with the ocean's destructive power.</p>
<h3>Centers of Worship</h3>
<p>Calimshan had a number of important shrines and temples to Istishia. The city of Keltar had a shrine known as the Steps of Istishia that was built thousands of years before the 14 th century DR . The city of Calimport had the massive, seven-story Palace of the Cresting Wave .</p>
<h3>Worship in Zakhara</h3>
<p>On the continent of Zakhara , Istishia was called one of the cold gods of the elements . As those were seen as uncaring for human affairs, they were considered opposed to the Land of Fate's pervasive culture of Enlightenment . Few Zakharans were willing to worship a cold god in order to gain power.</p>
