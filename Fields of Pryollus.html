<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , the ailing King Theris of Mourktar held what came to be known as the King's Tournament to decide who would become the new ruler of the city after his impending death. No clear victor emerged from the games however, as the competition was interfered with by the city's Imperceptor of Bane , Kabbarath Telthaug , in order to claim power for himself and his god.</p>
