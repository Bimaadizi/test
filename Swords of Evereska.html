<p>The Swords of Evereska was a militia formed of noble-born elven warriors and mages of Evereska . It symbolized that no elf, not matter how high born, was above serving in defense of the elven Last Home.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Swords were led by the Blademajor (or Blade-Major), a title that rotated among its more politically minded members periodically.</p>
<p>It was composed of two separate groups, the Noble Blades and Lordly Wands. The Blades were martial warriors that were led in battle by the Blademajor, while the Wands included spellcasters that were directed by the group's Artmaster.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Swords served in defense of Evereska however was needed, whether fighting of threats to the elven stronghold or search-and-rescue missions.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On Nightal 30 in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Aubric Nihmedu and Rhydwych Bourmay led the Swords on a perilous mission during the early battles between Evereska and the phaerimm , which recently escaped from beyond the Sharn Wall . They ventured through the phaerimm-controlled region of the Shaeradim to Rocnest , where they encountered a group of high mages . The elven mages were collectively forming a great portal that would allow the relief army of Waterdeep to bypass the Deadwall barrier created by the phaerimm and bolster Evereska's defenses. The Swords were successful in part. They bought the high mages just enough time until the chosen of Mystra Khelben Arunsun could destroy many of the phaerimm and rout their thralls. Unfortunately, Blademajor Nihmedu did not survive.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>Elves from among the most well-regarded Evereskan families served as the city's Swords. They were at least 100 strong in number circa 1371 DR .</p>
