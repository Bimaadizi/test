<p>Buppido was a cunning derro murderer who lived in the Underdark during the late 1480s DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Buppido was crazy at heart. He believed himself to be the living incarnation of the derro god Diinkarazan and, as the avatar of murder, he must offer bloody sacrifices to create a path of carnage through the Underdark for his people to follow to glory.</p>
<p>In his mind, any setbacks were part of his "divine plan". Convinced he was a god, he believed he could not be killed (or at least the death of his mortal form meant nothing to him), so he was completely fearless.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Buppido hailed from Gracklstugh but wandered the Underdark performing his carefully ritualized killings, hiding his true nature under a friendly facade.
During the late 1480s DR, he was captured by drow slavers of Velkynvelve .</p>
