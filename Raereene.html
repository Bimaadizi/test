<p>Raereene had access to a highly destructive scepter of sorts, capable of blasting a beholder into smithereens; it was almost certainly a blast scepter of sorts.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>She was a War Wizard , working out of Castle Obarskyr .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Raereene had an tryst with a young palace server, Kreane ; the two employed the Room of the Fire Wyrm for amorous activities while in Castle Obarskyr. In time for the Council of the Dragon , Raereene had become an ally of the late Alusair Obarskyr and Elminster Aumar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Arclath Delcastle bumped into Raereene when he was seeking Glathra Barcantle 's office at Castle Obarskyr in the lead to the Council of the Dragon of 1479Â DR . Later, when Raereene was enjoying a tryst with Kreane at the Room of the Fire Wyrm, she was briefly spied upon by Alusair Obarskyr and Elminster Aumar, who were in a secret passage with peepholes into the room.</p>
<p>Later, Alusair sought her out when needing to teleport Elminster into Stormserpent Towers; she was not initially inclined to help, but Vangerdahast 's vestige then tried to convince her, and Raereene agreed to do it. Raereene also later annihilated one of the vampire Manshoon 's mind-controlled bodies, that of a beholder, when it was attacking Arclath and the dancer Amarune Whitewave in the palace. She continued to help Alusair and Elminster's schemes afterwards, being noted as the one vigilant person by Storm Silverhand .</p>
