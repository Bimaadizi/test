<p>Clan Hillborn was a dwarven clan from the the North region of Faer√ªn that traced its ancestry back to Delzoun .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , the Hillborn dwarves were led by Vandra Hillborn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the eruption of Mount Hotenow in the Year of Knowledge Unearthed, 1451 DR , an old dwarfhold was revealed within the depths of the volcano, and a number of dwarven clans took it upon themselves to investigate its origins. The Hillborn expedition ignited conflict within Mount Hotenow when they encountered the incendiary fire giant cult-leader Gommoth and his followers, the cult of Maegera . The fire-worshiping cultists scattered the dwarves, isolating some from their group, while a band of mind flayers drove others to homicidal mania .</p>
<p>Vandra Hillborn enlisted aid from the Hero of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge , an up-and-coming adventurer in the city of Neverwinter. With their aid, the dwarves were able to reunited their lost members and continue on their expedition into one of the lost homes of the dwarves.</p>
