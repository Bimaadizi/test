<p>Spiked chains were type of exotic melee weapon.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Spiked chains were a length of metal chain whose last few links on each end were enlarged and enhanced with spikes. The length and size of these links were usually proportional to the size of their wielder in order to ensure optimal performance. At the half-way point of the chain and/or the midpoints of the two halves, a link of the chain was often replaced with a ring for grasping..</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>Spiked chains were similar to the whip in that they were a melee weapon with great range, allowing their wielders to attack foes from as far as 10 feet (3 meters) away. They took two hands to wield effectively and could be used to trip an opponent. The spiked chain was especially effective at disarming foes by wrapping around their weapon or weapon arm. It took great skill to wield spiked chains without injuring one's self, thus they were typically considered an exotic weapon.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Eladrin duelists were believed to have been the first race to wield spiked chains.</p>
