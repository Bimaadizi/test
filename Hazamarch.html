<p>Hazamarch produced barley , millet, and cattle .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>County Hazamarch was located in the northeast of Tethyr. It was bordered on the west by county Varyth of the Crown Lands . To the north and east were Valashar and county Morninggold on the other side of the River Ith . The River Ith also formed the southern border, and on the other side was the duchy of Suretmarch .</p>
