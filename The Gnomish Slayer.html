<p>The Gnomish Slayer was a unique enchanted scimitar created by an unnamed great gnomeish artificer .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Gnomish Slayer was a powerful magic blade with a +4 enchantment. When the weapon was wielded against any giant or related creature, the Slayer dealt devastating damage, similar in its destructive power to an exploding fireball spell .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This weapon was a creation of a legendary yet unnamed gnomish artificer who armed his clan with all sorts of inventions and weapons to be used against a neighboring clan of hill giants . Somehow, the giant clan was able to capture the artificer and demanded him to create a "gnomish slayer" for them to use against his kin. The gnome artificer did just that—he created The Gnomish Slayer , slicing his way to freedom. In the years that followed, the scimitar was wielded by many gnomish heroes against giants of all types.</p>
<p>By the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the scimitar found its way to the cold land of Rashemen . It was in possession of a Rashemaar berserker named Odesya stationed in the Ashenwood 's Lake of Tears Garrison , a Rashemi fort led by a wychlaran named Dalenka .</p>
