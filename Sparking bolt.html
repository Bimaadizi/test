<p>Sparking bolts were enchanted crossbow bolts imbued with lightning magics.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These bolts appeared quite ordinary apart from cracking with electric energy when touched. When sparking bolts were shot from a crossbow, they leaped towards the target like a bolt of lightning, leaving the smell of ozone and sulfur in its trail. Once such a bolt struck, it released its lightning magics into the wound.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sparking bolts were widely used by the goblins of the Legion of the Chimera that besieged Icewind Dale in the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR .</p>
