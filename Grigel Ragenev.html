<p>Grigel Ragenev was an alchemist working for the Cult of the Dragon in 1373 DR . Two days after the dracorage mythal was destroyed, on Nightal 8 , the white dragon Ssalangan accused him and the other cultists of deceiving them that the Rage of Dragons of that year would never end. Though Grigel explained that Sammaster had told them as much as he told the dragons and Ssalangan believed him, the dragon decided to eat him anyway.</p>
