<h2>History</h2>
<p>It remained unknown if Jimkal's boots belonged to the fabled drow wizard Jimkal or inspired by his tale. Sometime long before the late 14 th century DR , Jimkal's House fell victim to Menzoberranzan's cruel politics, forcing the male to go into exile, stripped of all his possessions. Before he fled, Jimkal begged one of the ruling Matron Mothers to allow him a simple pair of boots to ease the journey. The Matron Mother granted him the wish but not before transforming the pitiful male into a drider , damned to hunting in the darkness of the Underdark for the rest of his abominable life. The punchline of the story was the fact that with two of the so-called Jimkal's boots , the drider still had six other legs unclothed.</p>
<p>As of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Jimkal's boots were in possession of a drow merchant who did business in the Undergate , Westgate 's the unsavory underbelly.</p>
