<p>Tweens were parasitic spirits endemic to the Ethereal plane , though they were not a type of undead .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When not attached to any host, tweens appeared on the Border Ethereal to those on the Prime Material plane as smoky or shadowy humanoid silhouettes. Typically this was reminiscent of a squat human .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Tweens were very intelligent spirits, but they lacked goals or independent purposes.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Tweens possessed a limited form of shapechange and could only be harmed by creatures who could enter the Ethereal plane or had some magical effect like oil of etherealness . While attached to a host, they could move material things at short distances.</p>
<h3>Bonding</h3>
<p>All tweens sought out creatures on either the Prime Material or ethereal plane to bond with, having a preference for intelligent ones. They often took hosts that were humans or demihumans .</p>
<p>Once a suitable host was found, tweens would shadow their target's every move. When this bonding action truly began, it would appear as a vaguely visible shadow adjacent to their host's own. After several hours, the bonding became permanent, with neither the tween nor their host being capable of voluntarily severing it. If a tween's host were to die, it would cause such grief and shock for the spirit that it would fission into two tweens.</p>
<h3>Probability</h3>
<p>Tweens had the ability to subtly alter probability in the vicinity of their host, which extended out to roughly 50 feet (15 meters), and they could see a few seconds into the future. Through these combined abilities a tween granted their host greater luck. However, this positive probability was robbed from others within their host's vicinity, whether they be enemies or allies, afflicting them with bad luck.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Tweens fought independently of their hosts when attacked on the Ethereal plane. They typically fought with some ethereal form of weapon, like a sword . Otherwise, they mimicked the actions of their hosts in combat.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some scholars suspected that tweens were once members of a race that inhabited the Outlands known as the kyleen , who had fled to the ethereal plane after a strange chaos plague transformed them.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , tweens were known to be lurking around the Shadowdale region.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , a group of Beshabans operating a shrine in the sewers of Ravens Bluff , that included Cleo of Bad Luck and Tinsel Reltether , were all hosts to tweens.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>Tweens were capable of communicating telepathically with their host.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Creatures bonded with tweens were considered a mixed blessing by those around them. This often led to the host becoming an outcast.</p>
