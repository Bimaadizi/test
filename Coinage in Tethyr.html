<p>Coinage within the nation of Tethyr varied greatly over the many centuries. The early human tribes used a bartering system before the region became a part of the Calim Empire and then of Coramshan and later Calimshan . The Shoon Imperium , too, imposed its own currency, as did four separate Tethyrian dynasties. During the Interregnum , many of the larger cities and even guilds minted their own coins.</p>
<h2>Interregnum Period</h2>
<p>During the Interregnum, Zazesspur 's main coin was the gulder , which was comparable to a gold piece in most economies. At the time, it was the most valuable coin in Tethyr, and moneychangers in Amn would exchange 100 danters for 107 gulders. It had the seal of the city on both sides—three overlapping tridents ringed by gold coins.</p>
