<p>Adnan's physical weakness masked the awesome magical power he wielded.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Though he was a powerful sha'ir in his own right, Adnan truly excelled at giving genies specific commands so that they could not find ways to twist his words to suit their own needs.</p>
<p>Adnan constructed his wondrous tower in the Pilgrims' District in a single night with the help of several tasked architect genies . To help pass the time, Adnan began teaching gifted young sha'irs within his tower. To prove their merit, Adnan had prospective students transported deep into the Great Anvil by one of his djinni servants. They were abandoned there without food, water, or weapons of any kind. Students who were able to make it back to Adnan's tower were accepted, those who did not were never heard from again. Surviving students were typically able to enlist the aid of the Jann of the Haunted Lands in order to return safely, proving they had the ability to deal with genies successfully. Despite the inherent danger, Adnan's reputation as a sha'ir drew countless students to his door.</p>
<p>Adnan housed instructors and promising students within his tower.</p>
<p>With hopes to rekindle favor with the court, Adnan attempted to solve the mystery behind the Grand Caliph's sterility. Certain that one of the genie lords would shed some light on the matter, Adnan sent Tamr na-Fia , his most beloved student, to the Elemental planes to talk with the genie lords. Sadly, she never returned. Because of past insults committed against the genie rulers, Adnan dared not travel to the elemental planes himself to discover what happened to her.</p>
