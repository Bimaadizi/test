<p>Petyr was a traveling priest of Nobanion , who found himself in the Ten-Towns of Icewind Dale in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Petyr was a young and beautiful man with a head of golden red hair. He had a deep and clear voice.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>As a devote follower of Nobanion, Petyr respected his deity as a strong hunter and protector of the wildlife and protector of the week. His animal companion was a gift from the deity – the enormous lioness named Suzy .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Petyr hailed from the Vilhon Reach , where he lived surrounded by the followers of Lord Firemane. His animal companion, Suzy, came from the hot plains of Shaar and was a fellow servant of Nobanion. In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Petyr started receiving visions from his god, compelling him and Suzy to head out thousands of miles north, to the frozen tundras of Icewind Dale, despite of their natural dislike of the cold climate. Suzy possessed a gift of Nobanion that kept her warm and safe in Icewind Dale's low temperatures. Lord Firemane ordered Petyr to protect the wildlife that was just as endangered by the encroaching ancient doom as the humans of the Ten Towns. In his visions, the deity told him of the coming of the famed Hero of Neverwinter whom Petyr was to ally with.</p>
<p>One of Petyr's asks of the Hero of Neverwinter was finding powerful creatures, wild beasts imbued with power by the region's spirit defenders. A group of powerful beasts received such a boon as the ancient evil began threatening Icewind Dale. However, these legendary beasts were driven mad by pain and hunger and twisted by the evil's corrupting influence. Petyr asked the Hero to put these beasts out of their misery. Their locations were unknown but the beasts were known as the master of crags, the master of caves, the master of the tundra, and the last – the master of the sea."</p>
