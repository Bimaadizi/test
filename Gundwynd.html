<p>Gundwynd ( pronounced : /ˈ g ʌ n d w ɪ n d / GUND-wind ) was a notable Waterdhavian noble house that specialized in the procurement and sale of aerial steeds, particularly hippogriffs .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The family owned a villa in the Sea Ward , at the corner of Vondil Street and Mendever Street .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>House Gundwynd was one of the seven Waterdhavian noble houses that made up the Two-Cities Consortium that controlled trade between Waterdeep and Skullport .</p>
<p>Myrnd Gundwynd was the leader of the Black Boar mercenaries operating out of the Dock Ward .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Many Monsters, 1233 DR Lord Harthar Gost hired the Gundwynds, and their stable of hippogriff mounts, to provide their services as couriers for the Gost family's trade goods.</p>
<p>The family was ennobled in the Year of the Wandering Winds, 1251 DR alongside the Stormweather and Wavesilver families.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Black Wind, 1262 DR , during a flareup of the Guildwars Lord Geldirth Gost II reneged upon Harthar's deal. Shadow Thieves in the employ of Geldirth II raided the Gundwynd villa, capturing or killing every Gundwynd they could find, then absconded with the wealth in the villa's vaults. The surviving, captured Gundwynds were then trapped and starved to death in the Fireplace Level , where they rose as ghosts intent on killing Geldirth II or his descendants.</p>
<p>A distant relative of the deceased Gundwynds came to Waterdeep and claimed the family's noble title, rebuilding their wealth on the back of the slave trade. Though they couldn't prove the Gosts involvement, the Gundwynd family would harbor suspicions that the Gosts were responsible for the attack for centuries thereafter.</p>
<p>It appears that the Gundwynds had successfully abandoned the slave trade by mid-fourteenth century, as they had returned to their old aerial mounts business.</p>
<p>Around 1367 DR , with the family business struggling, Maurgosz Gundwynd attempted unsuccessfully to convince the Lords of Waterdeep that hippogriffs should be accepted as steeds in the Griffon Cavalry due to their more temperate nature.</p>
<p>Some time between the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR and the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , the heir of the family, Jynnia , disappeared and her younger brother, Myrnd became the heir in her place.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Tanarukka, 1388 DR the Gundwynd Clan was once again rendered extinct in Waterdeep after entering the burial portal in their family tomb in the City of the Dead to bury three members, shortly after the Spellplague first struck the city. All who emerged were permanently transformed into trolls or giants .</p>
