<p>The Moonflame was a grand temple dedicated to Selûne , the goddess of the moon , in the Temple District of Ravens Bluff .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This temple stood in the Altarside neighborhood of Ravens Bluff's Temple District, taking up an entire city block close to Clearwater Harbor . It was bounded by Mac Intyre Path , Morlgar's Ride , O'Kane Court , and Raven Way . Its main entrance faced Raven Way, along which it was directly across from De Villars Park .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The original Moonflame was a circular building, constructed of white marble , with broad steps leading up to a portico entrance. It had a domed glassteel roof. And the colors navy blue and silver featured prominently throughout.</p>
<p>Construction of a new Moonflame was underway prior to the Three Women War , but it wouldn't finish until after the conflict. Its successor was a far larger and grander complex, a truly exquisite structure, topped with a dome and spires, it was considered by some to be one of the most beautiful human temples in the city. Its tremendous central dome was encircled by four smaller domes. All five domes had been constructed with the spell glassteel , making them both clear and incredibly tough. These domes granted those inside the temple a view of the moon and lit up in a spectacular way when moonlight hit them, creating a visual display that some referred to as "moonflame".</p>
<p>The exterior of the temple had a courtyard, whose wall was partially formed by the building itself. The yard took up an area measuring 195 feet (59.4 meters) wide and 300 feet (91 meters) in length. The temple's yard boasted an assemblage of standing stones with carved out holes. Angled mirrors were affixed high atop the temple walls to deflect beams of moonlight down and through the precisely arranged standing stones, directing the beams through their holes and down onto groomed patches of moss . The yard also had a series of evergreens , which added to its tranquil atmosphere, and a fountain near each street corner. These four fountains were distinguished from one another by each being carved to resemble one of the phases of Selûne: a full-moon, a crescent-moon, a half-moon, and a new-moon.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The original temple was a more modest structure, composed of twelve rooms and a large garden with a fountain. These rooms included a foyer, several bedchambers, a private bedchambers for the High Moonmistress, a healing ward with six cots, a kitchen and eating area, and a room where temple supplies were stored. It was decorated throughout with images of stars, the moon, and navigation devices. Within its main chapel the windows were arranged in such a way as to form a lunar calendar – one could determine the date by judging how Selûne's light shone on the floor. A small, but elegantly decorated sitting room was later added off of the main temple. It was bedecked in scenes of the nightsky, with each wall depicting a different quarter phase of Selûne.</p>
<p>The reconstructed Moonflame had a grand entrance hall, with walls bespoken in murals depicting historical events in the life of their goddess Selûne. The hall culminated in three sets of staircases, two smaller staircases that lead downstairs into the Hall of the Silver Moon and one larger staircase that lead to the temple's main floor. This hall acted as a dining room, but was also used for holding banquets and wedding receptions. On that same floor one could find the numerous sleeping quarters available to the public.</p>
<p>From the main floor one could move directly forward into the Chapel of the Moonflame, where church services were held. It was situated directly below the temple's central glassteel dome. This large room had a suitably big dedicated altar near its southern wall, benches and pews lining its eastern and western walls, marble flooring that seemed to give off a light glow even during daylight hours, and more murals depicting historic events in the life of Selûne. This included the ever famous mural of Selûne battling Shar . To the back of the hall were two antechambers, rooms wherein preparations were made for services, that also connected to the rearmost hallway around the living quarters of the temple's High Priests.</p>
<p>The hallways to the left and right of the Chapel of the Moonflame lead to the temple's several living quarters, The right hallway housed the quarters of the adventuring clergy, adventurers of Ravens Bluff who enrolled at Moonflame, whilst the left hallway housed the living quarters of the temple's permanent residents. Down the left hallway were also a common room for recreational activities and a small library. Each wing had only a single shared washroom. At the end of both hallways were doors that connected the singular hallway surrounding the rooms of the High Priests. This area of the temple was known as the West Wing.</p>
<p>The West Wing was off limits to all but the High Priests and certain powerful clergy. Besides offices and sleeping quarters, the wing housed a sacred artifact known as the Orb of Selûne , which promised protection so long as it was joined with the Moonflame. It sat upon an altar made of pure silver , though it was sturdy as adamantite , and chased with runes and inscriptions that spoke of the orb's value, Both the orb and its altar initially resided within the Chapel of the Moonflame, but were later moved to this more secure space.</p>
<p>The West Wing room the Orb of Seûne was stored within was secured by a silver-inlaid doorway, etched in runes and marked by a soft-glowing symbol of the moon. This always matched whatever Seûne's current phase was above Toril . The door was warded in magics that not only kept it in a locked state, but which would destroy any who touched it, save for the High Priests. Inside, the orb's altar was ringed by stone steps, topped with heavy carpeting for purposes of occasional prayer by those with the clearance to enter. A single steep skylight, warded with magic to fend off both intruders and the weather, gave view to the outside world. The room's walls were adorned in mosaics depicting the phases of Selûne, flanked by scenes depicting the story of the Orb's retrieval from the gem dragon Dektherissamin . As a last line of defense, four stone golems were stationed in the room. Each was sculpted in the likeness of one of the temple's High Priests and sat upon a stone pedestal in one of the room's four corners.</p>
<p>At some point in the late 14 th century DR, the temple interior had a small grove of trees added to it, their growth limited only by the building's roof.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The clergy could be asked to raise someone from death , though such spells usually carried a steep fee. The Moonflame also had sleeping rooms on its lower floor, available to the public at the cost of one copper piece per night. And on more than one occasion, individuals approached the Mooneflame's clergy for the purposes of curing them of lycanthropy , such as by paying a fee to have remove curse cast upon them.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Moonflame was renowned for its parties, which it held at least every tenth day of the tenday , starting at dusk and possibly going for as late as the early light of dawn. As well as its luminous, green moonwine that some sailors partook a bit too much of. But by far their most popular celebration occurred during the winter solstice – on this longest night of the Calendar of Harptos many would hang wreathes of holly and burn bayberry candles , leaving them going until they snuffed themselves out. At night, which was known as "Alban Arthan", was when people would go attend the temple's yearly ceremony. According to some, this ceremony was one of the most beautiful to occur throughout the year. Beyond public celebrations, the clergy had two sacred rituals that were restricted to the faithful, called the Conjuring of the Second Moon and the Mystery of the Night.</p>
<p>Nightly worship services occurred either outside, within the temple's courtyard, or within the temple itself in the Chapel of the Moonflame. Both barefoot priestesses and lay worshipers would kneel for prayer, or dance in worship, atop the moonlit patches of moss in the temple's yard. Patrols of the City Watch typically maintained close observation of the temple yard at night for the purpose of keeping its thinly-clad clergy from harm. The duty was reportedly quite popular among Watchmen, receiving plenty of volunteers.</p>
<p>The temple also kept records of its goings on, but these were usually unavailable to those outside of the clergy.</p>
<p>Outside of the temple itself, members of the clergy ran a poor house in the city's Crow's End district, called the Hand of Selûne Charity Center .</p>
<p>When it came to rewarding adventurers who aided the church in some manner, one common method was to gift potions of moon-healing . Another was to grant them a "Favor of Selûne", redeemable at any later date. This favor guaranteed the recipient a choice between either receiving two moderate spells of their choice or having remove curse cast upon them.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>For much of its history the Moonflame was led by a high priestess called the High Moonmistress. In the late 14 th century DR the temple went through several High Moonmistresses, including Starglitter , Mirial Moonsilver , Jenethra Mooncrown , and Arial Nightglow .</p>
<p>Arial Nightglow had previously served as the Chief Assistant to all of the aforementioned High Moonmistresses. And in 1366 DR , before her assassination, Starglitter had been preparing Arial to eventually start her own temple somewhere in the region.</p>
<p>Mirial was a very driven and popular leader, intent on expanding the influence of Selune in the Vast. Under her organizational skills the temple prospered and grew. She and her predecessor both had Grae Angell as a personal guard, who was deeply affected by his failure to defend Starglitter and continued to feel responsible for her death nigh on three years later.</p>
<p>The Moonflame saw a significant change in its leadership structure in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Four silverstars went on a daring mission on behalf of Selûne and so pleased the goddess with their work that she decided all of them should be leader of the Moonflame. Each of them would represent a phase of Selûne and assume leadership of the temple during their specific quarter of Selûne. These four leaders were Aric Moonstone , High Initiate of the Full Moon; Amanda Redmoon , High Initiate of the Crescent Moon; Valas Stargazer-Blackmantle , High Initiate of the Half Moon; and Daren of Selûne , High Initiate of the New Moon. However, since the Moonflame's leadership was unstable, changing every few days, Arial Nightglow essentially continued to act in a leadership role. Later that same year Aric accidentally underwent a magical change of sex and took on the name Alessia. She tried to pass herself off as a completely new priestess, going to the effort of having a simulacrum made of her former male-self.</p>
<p>Under this leadership the priestess Arakha Dunsoun held the position of Moonhand. She was encharged with maintaining the peace and tranquility of the temple grounds, as well as the safety of its clergy.</p>
<p>One of the few notable residents of the Moonflame that weren't members of the clergy was Starhope , the orphaned child of a priestess. She was raised in a pampered fashion by the temple's clergy and looked after the younger children in the Moonflame. She also tutored under Aric Moonstone to one day be a cleric herself.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point in the early 14 th century DR, Lady Lauren De Villars sponsored the construction of a shrine to Waukeen within the heavily Selûnite populated Harbor District . The Moonflame's priests opposed and voted against the plans, feeling that they held domain over the waterfront district, but they were overruled by the city's Clerical Circle . In an effort to mollify their concerns, Lady De Villars decided to also sponsor the construction of an observatory for the Church of Selûne on the Hammerfell Heights . Around that time a traveling Selûnite by the name of Novak arrived in Ravens Bluff and was outraged over the compromise. He decided to sabotage the construction of the Waukeenar shrine and fake a prophecy, foretelling of his plans, impersonating a local soapbox preacher named Blind Billy . Some of the workers involved went on to speculate that Blind Billy was working on behalf of the Moonflame and the clergy in turn were possibly behind the acts of sabotage going on. Meanwhile, Waukeenar High Priest Galvan Sharpeyes was unwilling to believe the Moonflame was responsible.</p>
<p>When High Priestess Starglitter was confronted with these accusations by a group of adventurers, she made a rare daylight appearance to issue a public statement that the Moonflame had no involvement with either the acts of sabotage or Blind Billy. She denounced his prophecies as ramblings, unsupported by prayers and spells she used to divine Selûne's will. She then offered each of the adventurers healing prayers in return for putting the prophecy matter to rest and gifted each of them a silver medallion in the shape of a crescent moon.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR , in the month of Kythorn , a cult of Cyricists established a temple within the sewers of Ravens Bluff . Six months later Chief Prelate Sirrus Melandor and then-head of the Moonflame, Starglitter, were close to discerning the location of their temple and determined to remove them from the city. After learning of this, Cyricist Micarlin Narklath summoned an assassin spirit to murder Starglitter on the night of Uktar 28 . She tried to fend it off with flame strike , but to no avail. At that same time her Chief Assistant, Arial Nightglow, was busy preparing for the evening services.</p>
<p>An hour or two later Arial discovered Starglitter's body. She quickly sought the scrying pool in Starglitter's room to contact High Priestess Wyndra Syrylstone , head of Selûne's main temple in the Eastern Heartlands . With the Feast of the Moon fast approaching, Wyndra urged Arial not to alarm the other Selûnites, as the festival required a high priestess and she wanted to ensure her replacement's safety. She authorized Arial to hire a group of adventurers to discretely handle the person responsible, paying them no more than 1,250 GP each, and if they failed she was to contact the City Watch. Arial wasted no time in sending out novice priestesses to find adventurers willing to help. Within an hour a group of adventurers were found and brought before Starglitter's corpse, covered with a large heavy blanket . After investigating the scene and questioning priests within the temple, the adventurers head out into the night, armed with a prayer from Arial and a powerful wand of dispel magic on loan from Wyndra.</p>
<p>The adventurers managed to uncover the Cyricists and their plot to murder Sirrus Melandor next. They engaged in an extraneous battle within the sewers, ultimately coming out triumphant. Hours before they would arrive back at the Moonflame, a mage in the employ of Wyndra teleported Starglitter's replacement to the temple. When the adventurers returned, late-night mass was just at its end and it was a few hours until dawn. They were greeted by Arial, who brought them inside and introduced them to the new High Priestess, Mirial Moonsilver.</p>
<p>Over the next three years Mirial worked to expand the influence of the Church of Selûne in the region, building up its temple and making repeated requests to Wyndra to send her more clergy to aid in running the Moonflame.</p>
<p>Before the Three Women War kicked off, the Selûnite clergy and the city's population of lay worshipers grew, culminating in pressure to construct a larger temple that was eventually met. However, with the advent of the war the clergy as a whole were unable to complete and occupy the new Moonflame.</p>
<h3>Three Women War Period</h3>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Wyndra Syrylstone sent the priestess Katrina Star away from Calaunt to train under Mirial Moonsilver in Ravens Bluff, feeling that she showed great promise. While en route to the city, Katrina was kidnapped and tortured by a Sharran priest, who took advantage of her arachnophobia . However, unbeknownst to the Sharran, the spiders he was using carried the curse of lycanthropy and would tranform Katrina into a werespider . Katrina slew her captor and, her mind twisted into a lawful evil state by the curse, continued her journey to Ravens Bluff with an insidious notion of infecting the Moonflame's clergy.</p>
<p>Over the next three months Katrina would enter the bed chambers of slumbering priests on nights of a full moon, sedate them with strong herbal mixtures, and leave the infected to believe they were simply experiencing strange identical nightmares every time they transformed. She especially targeted the specialty priests among the clergy, as silverstars had better control over lycanthropy transformations. By the month of Uktar, several of the clergy were infected and under Katrina's sway. Twelve people had died from attacks by the werespiders, either outside the temple or near the Hand of Selûne Charity Center. In every instance the victims' bodies were horribly mutilated, evidently from being attacked by a beast. Concerned by the rash of nightmares among her clergy, the string of attacks, and the fast approaching Feast of the Moon falling on the night of a full moon, Mirial decided to hire a group of adventurers to investigate the matter.</p>
<p>Due to the Moonflame's ongoing projects and the Three Women War raging in the background, the temple's funds were tight. All Mirial could offer the adventurers were moonstones from her private collection, worth 500 gold pieces. After receiving testimony from her bodyguard Grae, the adventurers left to investigate Mirial's assembled list of witnesses to the attacks. On the Feast of the Moon the adventurers were invited back to Moonflame to attend a " night stalk " ritual and they arrived just as dusk was closing over Ravens Bluff, the clergy assembled in the main chapel. The adventurers informed Mirial all that they had learned over the course of their investigation before she bid them to follow her into the garden.</p>
<p>The clergy walked in a line two abreast, Mirial at the forefront, each carrying a bowl of wine or milk from the chapel, down the hall into the dining room, and out to the temple gardens. They placed these bowls upon an altar and begin a chorus of chants. As Selûne's silvery light rose above the garden walls and down onto the clergy, their singing became cut off by anguished cries as they began transforming into werespiders. This included the likes of Ed Thrum , Troy Yacuk , and Vera Wingard . As the transformations were underway Mirial quickly cast Selûne's choice , hoping the quest spell would allow at least a few of her clergy to maintain control of their bodies, but was immobilized in a beam of moonlight as she maintained it. When the last of the werespiders fell, one of Selûne's Shards step forth from the moonlight enveloping Mirial. The shard took the form of a lovely girl, seemingly no older than 16 years of age, garbed in the plain brown robes of an acolyte of the church and with hair that hung down to her waist. The beam of moonlight disappeared shortly behind her. Mirial collapsed to the ground and the infected clergy began to transform back, their lycanthropy cured by the shard. When Mirial came to she thanked the adventurers for their help and ordered that all the fallen priests be buried among the unfaithful in the City Cemetery .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , on Eleint 21 , the day of the holiday Remembrance Day , a group of Talassans assaulted the Moonflame with the explicit purpose of assassinating High Priestess Mirial, or more ambitiously the destruction of the temple itself before sundown. The Talassans, composed of both clerics and fighters , were led by Thunderhips , a Lliiran paladin who had fallen from grace and taken up worship of Talos . Their lightning attacks brought down a great explosion of fire and smoke, creating four large holes in the temple's roof and attracting the attention of nearby adventurers, whom included the likes of Andrews Womack . A significant portion of the damage was dealt by Thunderhips himself, using several spells and spell scrolls , including unholy words . By the time the adventurers arrived to intervene the Moonflame's defenders had been pushed back into the temple proper. And the priestess Auburn Bright was rallying her fellow Selûnites against the Talassans.</p>
<p>Even with the adventurers' aid in fending off the Talassans, the Moonflame's casualties from the attack were severe. Numerous clergy were dead and even more were missing. A number of Selûnites were able to be brought back to life thanks to scrolls and items that had been stored away within the temple's vaults, but fourteen priestesses and paladins remained dead, including Mirial's bodyguard Grae Angell. Mirial herself was deemed dead at the hands of Thunderhips. Last seen battling Talassans from the temple roof, her body was never recovered during the efforts to dig out the upper floors in search of survivors. Following this, temple services were scheduled to occur on the next full moon, whilst a memorial to the slain clergy was to be held and blessed during the next new moon. In the weeks following the attack, the Selûnites were reluctant to speak of the tragedy in anything but veiled terms.</p>
<p>In Mirial's absence, Jenethra Mooncrow acted as the temple's High Priestess. She would die two months later on one of the church's holy day ceremonies, when several members of the clergy were possessed by some foul magic and transformed into creatures that attacked the Selûnites gathered, lay worshipers and priestesses alike. The incident was reported on by the Ravens Bluff Trumpeter , who had scarce information on what went down, save some sources that claimed there were at least eight fatalities among the clergy.</p>
<p>As the war continued to rage on, over twenty more Selûnite priests and paladins lost their lives, including the likes of Rowel and Mary . By the end of the Three Women War, the old Moonflame had been rendered barely fit for use and was torn down.</p>
<h3>Post-War Period</h3>
<p>By the end of the war, the highest ranking priestess left alive was Arial Moonglow, thus she was forced to take up the role of leadership for the beleagured temple.</p>
<p>Arial inducted a number of likely novices into her sundered clergy. Around 1371 DR , a number of evergreen saplings were planted around the Moonflame. Also during that year a terrorist group called the Circle of Four was wreaking havoc among the temples of Ravens Bluff. After overtaking the temples of temples of Lliira , Torm , and Tyr with the combined aid of Cyricists, Talassans, and Talontar they planned to do the same to the rest of the city's temples, including the Moonflame. This incited people forming long lines outside of the city's remaining temples, including the Moonflame.</p>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the temple saw the enstatement of its four High Initiates of the Moon. That same year, the city's Temple of Sune was destroyed in a battle between avatars of Sune and the archdevil Glasya . While efforts were underway to construct a new Palace of Passion, the Moonflame offered refuge to the Sunite clergy, giving them lodging in many of the temple's quarters.</p>
<p>Continued clashes within Ravens Bluff saw further damage dealt to the temple, though some sort of protective magic seemed to be mitigating some of that potential damage. Rumors abounded that it was the will of Selûne herself protecting the temple.</p>
<p>Sometime later on Flamerule 20 , when the Moonflame was under the leadership of Darin of Selûne and festivities were underway for the Midsummer's Festival , an extraplanar trader from Sigil named Tehtravese hired the powerful, cunning rakshasa Maharajah Lord Terrax to break into the temple and steal the Orb of Selûne , offering him in return control over werepanthers and weretigers . At the same time, a nefarious group called the Cabal of the Moon's Blood was planning to trash the festivities. With the help of his insider sources, Tehtraverse was able to coordinate his robbery to coincidence with this attack.</p>
<p>Chaos rang throughout the Temple District's crowded streets as weretigers of the Cabal attacked City Watchmen and the clergies of Selûne, Helm , and Lathander . At the Moonflame itself, the Cabal brought about many casualties, providing just the distraction Terrax needed to steal the Orb of Selûne . Utilizing a ring of spell storing , charged with the spell disintegrate , he cut out a deep, perfectly circular hole atop the surface of the altar to remove the Orb. Shortly after the theft, the metal of the altar and the glow given off by its runes both began to darken. When the clergy were alerted to the presence of two corpses on the northeast lawn, identified as priests who normally guarded the West Wing, panic began to strike. They hurried down the Chapel of the Moonflame and back into the Orb's secure room. There they discovered its stone golems were destroyed and the Orb nowhere to be seen. Despair, rage, and further panic overtook the clergy at the news of its theft. But even more surprising was what came next.</p>
<p>An acolyte announced that a small group of Sharrans had been walking through the Temple District, healing those injured by the Cabal's attack, and eventually made their way to the Moonflame's doorstep. Led by a Nightseer named Jesibelle , they sought an audience with High Priest Darin. Jesibelle spoke of having been sent by the goddess Shar herself to render unto them aid through information. She then provided to a group of adventurers that had accompanied Derin a map of Sarbreen , marked with the location of where Tehtraverse was holding an auction for the Orb of Selûne .</p>
<p>Traveling down into the lower depths of Sarbreen, fighting all manner of agents of evil organizations and faiths, the adventurers eventually managed to catch up to Tehtravese. He was standing in a magically dark cavern, in the company of Galatheron , a deep dragon who had came a long way to purchase the Orb. Tehtravese expounded about having been instrumental in the Selûnites' initial recovery of the Orb from the horde of Dektherissamin. He gave his reasoning for stealing as being twofold, just to see if it could be done and because the Selûnites had never paid him for his aid. He then offered them the change to bargain for its return, demanding half of their magical wealth as payment. Regardless of whether they agreed to this or not, Galatheron engaged the adventurers in combat.</p>
<p>When the adventurers vanguished the deep dragon, the darkness spells covering the cavern they were in dissipated, revealing a small portion of Galatheron's horde to surround them. They then noticed on the back of the Sharran's map was a drawing, faintly resembling the cavern in which they stood. turn with the Orb and be hailed as heroes. With no means of pursuing the evil individuals that had gotten away, the adventurers followed their map to the surface. When they returned they initially brought the Orb to its previous altar, but after no reaction occurred they took it to the altar within the Chapel of the Moonflame. There a latticework of pure silver manifested out of thin air and joined the Orb of Selûne to the altar.</p>
<p>The altar began to morph, taking on the form of two silver disks between the Orb, with bars of silver attaching and supporting one above the other. A hole then opened in the upper disk and the bars between them unfurled, leaving the upper disk to resemble Selûne's current phase. The goddess then spoke to the Moonflame's High Priests, telling them she wished for the adventurers who had rescued it to touch the Orb and receive her guidance. Darin of Selûne spoke to the adventurers, "I understand the sacrifice and risk you all took for the return of the Orb. I have wished to find a way to reward you, and the Lady has shown me her will . . . You will each be allowed to bath yourselves in the power of the Orb, and gain whatever the Lady wishes." Those who chose to partake of the offer received from Selûne a powerful vision of their destiny and were left marked by a permanent, silver glowing tattoo in the shape of the moon.</p>
