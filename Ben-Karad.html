<p>Ben-Karad was a priest of Myrkul who died years before the late 13 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ben-Karad was one of the known owners of a unique enchanted Myrkulyte belt â€“ the Belt of Bones . When the wizard from Urmlaspyr named Isanan retired, he found a buyer for the magic belt that served him for several years. Ben-Karad was overjoyed with being able to claim a Myrkulyte item for himself and gladly made the purchase. However, his life ended in the sewers of Waterdeep some years before the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , and the Belt of Bones was though lost until it reappeared in Icewind Dale some time later.</p>
