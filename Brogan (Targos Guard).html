<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Brogan was a human man armored in Targos Guard's leathers and a horned helmet . He was armed with a dagger and a battleaxe .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , the town of Targos became besieged by the Legion of the Chimera . One of the Legion's surprise attacks teleported a troop of goblins into the Targos docks, where Brogan was among the guards. He managed to trap a large group of goblins in one of the warehouses and attempted to get aid from one of the adventuring bands hired by Targos, the Iron Collar Band , who were more interested in drinking at the The Salty Dog Tavern than working. Time was of the essence for Brogan, as if the goblins started a fire in the warehouse, the resulting blaze would consume the entire docks area.</p>
