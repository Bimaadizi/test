<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>She had been awakened in the middle of the night by strange noises coming from just north of the compound. She considered his uncle to be a honest man and a pillar of the community. Rose wandered the oasis sometimes ; once, while walking behind the smithy, she saw one of the sheik's sons enter the sandvoyagers' guild by a secret way; she could not tell the twins apart.</p>
