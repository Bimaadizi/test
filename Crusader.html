<p>A crusader is a warrior in the service of a deity who acts according to a certain code.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Crusaders are rare warriors who are in the highest favors of their chosen deities. These warriors are true zealots, striking in the name of their chosen causes with fury. A crusader will never betray her chosen cause willingly, and is a devastating warrior on the battlefield. Each crusader is bound to an alignment, be it order, good , evil , or chaos . Crusaders gain incredible abilities, rivaling those of mages , and are capable of shrugging off blows that would be fatal to other warriors. Good crusaders are often mistaken for paladins , the difference being revealed only when the crusader is powerless to heal a wounded man with her hands or summon a celestial mount. Evil crusaders are among the deadliest people in Faerûn , and bring a blight of darkness wherever they go. Crusaders may arise in any part of Faerûn, from any race, but they are rare.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>These warriors gain extra accuracy and skill if they are harmed or injured in battle. A crusader also gains many powerful divine abilities and maneuvers, which they cannot select when to use, but their God grants them in the course of a combat. The maneuvers are rejuvenated by meditating for five minutes.</p>
