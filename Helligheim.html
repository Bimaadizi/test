<p>Helligheim (meaning " Holy Home " in the giant language ) was an ancient fire giant -ruled kingdom in Faerûn , during the Time of Giants of the Dawn Age ( −30,000 DR to −24,000 DR ).</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The southern borders of this kingdom stretched along the Dragon Sea .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the year 27,900 DR , the fire giants of this kingdom established twelve mighty fortresses along the shore of the Dragon Sea.</p>
<p>A century later, it would be one of the kingdoms that fought in the Thousand Year War against the ancient dragon kingdoms. Over the course of this war, Helligheim was gradually made isolated from the rest of Ostoria and terribly weakened. One by one the dragons overran and shattered their fortresses along the Dragon Sea's coast. By the time the King-Killer Star appeared in the sky, only one remote keep in the Giantspike Mountains remained.</p>
<p>It was one of the few fragment kingdoms that survived past Ostoria's fall, but within a millennia it eventually fell. By some accounts, only surviving for another century or two. The jotunbrud gradually retreated further into the frozen north, their most powerful runecasters sealing the last remaining keep.</p>
