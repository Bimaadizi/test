<p>Mardon's Mountaineering was a school in Eileanar that taught practical mountaineering skills.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The school was attended by those that sought to scale the many forbidding and peaks and glaciers of Netheril without relying on magic, such as the magic-blocking Widowmaker Mountain . They were taught the necessary skills via a set of artificial climbing walls that got progressively more complicated and difficult as they introduced more obstacles and unclimbable surfaces. The building was left open-roofed so that climbers were exposed to inclement weather, and the instructors often performed their tests during active storms so as to truly test their students. Thanks to the use of quasimagical items such as rings of feather fall , there were no fatalities within the school. It usually took about three months of intensive training to fully prepare a student for real-world climbing, costing the trainee about 150 gp plus any equipment needed.</p>
