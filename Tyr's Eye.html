<p>Tyr's Eye was a large and busy walled strake, or plaza, located between the Blacklake District and Castle Never .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tyr's Eye was a roughly shaped, round, and slightly elongated plaza. It was paved with stone and housed a collection of civic buildings, businesses, and other high-profile locations that benefited from the proximity to Castle Never. It also housed an open-air market of many stalls and tents. The merchants dealt in a number of goods, from school supplies, paper , parchment , quills , fruits, potions , and even expensive magical items , all of these goods were available in a mundane form and rarer exotic variety.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Blacklake District survived the war with Luskan of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR almost unscathed and Tyr's Eye, which was technically a part of Blacklake, remained unaffected. Soon after, Shadow War of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR ravaged Neverwinter's economy. Soon after the war, a great fire blazed across the plaza, torching the mages ' school that was a prominent part of Tyr's Eye, and several other buildings. Eyewitnesses claimed that a red-headed sorceress was seen stoking the flames. To strengthen the Neverwinter economy, Lord Alagondar extended a personal invitation to the Church of Waukeen to establish a temple in the City of Skilled Hands and aid in its financial recovery. The Temple of Waukeen was built at the site of Neverwintran mages' academy. Along with the temple, a new Thayan enclave was established out of financial desperation. During that time in 1374 DR, access to most of the city was restricted for non-citizens. The Blacklake district was the only area open to guests, but only via a pass purchase.</p>
