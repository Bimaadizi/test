<p>Lieutenant Karvan Hur was the ranking officer of the contingent of guards stationed at the Thayan enclave within the city of Proskur during the late 14 th century DR . While he and his men were technically subordinate to the enclave's Red Wizards and their handful of Thayan knights , they were largely ignored by these groups.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Karven led a group of 36 guards, who were divided into five six-man squads, most of whom were Thayan . Amongst them were a few foreign-born mercenaries, though they were closely observed by their superiors.</p>
<p>Amongst his guards stationed throughout the enclave, Lieutenant Hur kept at least one wizard stationed at the front gate, armed with either a wand of detect magic or wand of detect thoughts to glean more insight into those who entered within.</p>
