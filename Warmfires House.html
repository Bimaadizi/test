<h2>History</h2>
<p>Warmfires House was a venture by Sembian investors. It received a number of visitors, including local scribe Maervidal Iloster , on tours during its grand opening. After Lord Mourngrym Amcathra had a guard post installed nearby, the surrounding area came to be called "Northend", and a new cluster of shops and houses had risen around it.</p>
<p>The Zhentarim rented the place for a revel at some point in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR . During the revel, they planned on slaying Maervidal Iloster, but he never came, being substituted by a disguised Storm Silverhand . By the end of the night, many of the Zhentarim were slain by her, with the rest of them captured by the staff.</p>
