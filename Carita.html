<p>Carita was one of the inhabitants of the Wandering Village who traveled Icewind Dale between the Ten Towns and Kuldahar on the Spine of the World in the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , traveled with her small community of hunters and gatherers in the harsh northern lands. Unlike other members of the Wandering Village, Carita was not friendly to outsiders and insisted visitors spoke to anyone else in the village but her. Carita was married to Kyosti , one of the Wandering Village's hunters. She, however, was not a loyal wife as she found a consort in Leevi . The two decided to kill Carita's husband, and she lured him away from the village.</p>
<p>When a group of adventurers from Targos arrived at the village, they investigated the hunter's disappearance, discovering the truth about the murder. Carita and Leevi fled the Wandering Village. Soon after, Carita and Leevi came across the Beastlord Harshom , who was in pursuit of the adventurers. The pair eagerly informed the Beastlord of the heroes' plans and location. As a reward, both were fed to Harshom's four war- bears .</p>
