<p>A black sickle , also known as a blightbringer , was a magical sickle of unholy power.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>In combat, the black sickle could be wielded as a sickle +2 .</p>
<p>This evil weapon was the bane of plants and plant-based creatures . Upon striking a normal plant, it suffered an instant withering death along with all other normal plants and vegetation within a radius of 30 feet (9 meters). Plant-based monsters ( myconids , shambling mounds , treants , and so forth) had a chance of resisting this herbicidal fate, but even if they managed to avoid it, they were compelled to make like a tree and leaf the area at once.</p>
