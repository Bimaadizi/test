<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point prior to 797Â DR , Radellus came to Sreve to take Justal Iroon 's tower, and after a fierce battle, he prevailed. Radellus was later defeated by Kurtal, who froze some of the rubble falling from the tower in time to serve as a warning to the villagers.</p>
<p>Sreve was destroyed during Kurtal 's tenure as the Magister , due to the number of duels with his challengers that took the fighting there. The town had been reduced to nothing by the late 14 th century DR .</p>
