<p>The Ilitul ( pronounced : /ˈ ɪ l ɪ t ʊl / ILL-ih-tul ) family was a noble family of Waterdeep in the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th centuries, Dalereckoning .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the Ilitul family was headed by Murgos Ilitul and his consort Zorene . Their eldest son was Zak Ilitul .</p>

<p>The Ilitul villa was located in the Sea Ward on the south side of Ivory Street in the point it made between the Street of Whispers and the Street of the Singing Dolphin . Directly across Ivory Street was the villa belonging to the Emveolstone family. On the opposite corner were the Shrines of Nature . Across the Street of Whispers was the Melshimber family villa.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>At some point in the early 1370s DR there was bad blood between the Ilituls and the Thorp family because Guster Ilitul was observed strangling Delbert Thorp during the second annual Black Bucket Hunt while they were exploring Undermountain . The viewing was accomplished by a modified arcane eye spell that projected the eye's view as an image that others could see.</p>

<p>The family was ennobled in the Year of the Cockatrice, 1248 DR . They were of Chondathan descent and held Tempus in high regard. As of 1372 DR there were 34 members that could claim nobility.</p>
