<p>She had also married Garthond Shessair , and given birth to their daughter, Shandril Shessair . She was an enemy of the Cult of the Dragon, which sought to abduct her in order to explore and understand her spellfire.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dammasae was born on the Sword Coast , per Gorstag, and per the Zhentarim Sememmon , she spent her youth in Thunderstone , Cormyr . Before meeting Garthond, Dammasae was an adventurer and member of the Sorority of the Silver Fire who had already destroyed two dracoliches in the course of her adventuring.</p>
<p>She met Garthond en route to a Cult stronghold after being captured, bound, drugged, and gagged by Cult agents. The pair adventured together for a time, fell in love, and married in Baldur's Gate . She settled down in Elturel during her pregnancy, birth, and raising the infant Shandril until she was eight months old. The couple and their baby left for Shadowdale afterwards, together with Gorstag, in order to look for Syluné . However, they were ambushed by forces from the Cult at the Bridge of Fallen Men , where Dammasae was mortally wounded, almost certainly in the Year of the Lion, 1340 DR .</p>
<p>Gorstag saw to it that she received some healing in High Horn afterwards, but it was insufficient; they could not reach Syluné in time. She was buried on the knoll where previously Ildathchance Orlaer was visited by a vision of Mystra ; this was a little knoll on the north side of the road, close to the road west of Toad Knoll that was sacred to Mystra.</p>
