<h2>History</h2>
<p>Reyni was a common soldier who worked his way up through the ranks. He won the command of Citadel Rashturl over the competition such as Arbas Rosznar , but came to fame during the First Dragonspear War of 1356 DR when he fought many baatezu and ogres . His command of Citadel Rashturl was effective and well-executed, including a training regimen he devised that educated his troops in tactics, strategy, and history. Thanks to his leadership and administration, he made his garrison the most elite and well-trained group in Amn, and the posting in the isolated, spartan Citadel was considered a "pearl" that any soldier would be happy to get. His command continued through 1370 DR , maintaining the very high standards he had built.</p>
