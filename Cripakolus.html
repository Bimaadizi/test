<p>Cripakolus was an azer lord on the Elemental Plane of Fire in 1373 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Cripakolus was the leader of the azer Everash Tribe in the Elemental Plane of Fire. However, most of his fellows were enslaved by the efreet of Hafiz al-Milhab to work in his mine. Thus, in 1373 DR, when his men captured Kaanyr Vhok and his allies, Cripakolus bargained with Kaanyr, offering them their freedom and to show them a passage to the City of Brass , in exchange for destroying the efreet mine for azers.</p>
