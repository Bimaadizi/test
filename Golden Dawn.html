<p>Golden Dawn was the talking horse of Queen Zaranda Rhindaun of Tethyr in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Physically, "Goldie" was a standard medium-sized war horse . However, unlike a normal horse, Goldie was intelligent and could speak. While certainly magical, she was not a familiar , and it is not known how she came to use and understand language.</p>
<p>Goldie had a golden coat with a long white mane. Her ears were long and shapely for a mare, and had been described as similar in shape to the lateen sails of feluccas from Amn .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Goldie was a snarky, stubborn individual who was not afraid to speak her mind. She complained about being a riding horse, but in truth, she took great pride in her skill at carrying Zaranda.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Besides her supernatural gift of speech, Golden Dawn was intelligent and fought strategically, giving warnings to her rider. Her large, triangular ears gave her the ability to hear crowds from at least a half mile (0.8 kilometers) away.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Goldie was fitted with a Calimshite saddle that had a high cantle .</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to her caretakers, Goldie owned a set of loaded dice .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>For entertainment, Goldie enjoyed playing dice with her grooms in the palace of Faerntarn . She cheated.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Zaranda considered Goldie a true friend, and the horse called her mistress "Randi" as a term of endearment, though the human found the nickname too juvenile. Goldie could not actually read Zaranda's mind, but she knew the woman well enough that it sometimes appeared like she could. Usually, Zaranda admired Golden Dawn's council.</p>
<p>Goldie preferred to mate with stallions who were normal horses, unable to talk.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the spring of the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR , Golden Dawn accompanied then-Countess and adventuress Zaranda Star on a journey from Thay to Zazesspur to sell loot.</p>
<p>Besides serving as Zaranda's mount in combat, Goldie once assisted her mistress in taking Castle Lutwill by pretending to be Zizzy, the Wonder Horse , companion of Fyadros , the Incomparably Wonderful Bard, so that Star Protective Services could be snuck into the castle at night.</p>
<p>Goldie remained Zaranda's riding mare after the latter was made queen.</p>
