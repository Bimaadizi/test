<p>Invisible blades were a variety of enchanted daggers whose blades could not be seen.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Invisible blades appeared as only a hilt, their blades being all-but invisible, making them easily concealable. Although invisible, the blade struck as a regular weapon, was always silent when it struck, and never reflected light. Only the wielder of the dagger could see the weapon's blade, as if they were using the detect invisibility spell .</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>To craft an invisible blade , the spells invisibility , detect invisibility , gaze reflection , and a form of magical silence were used on the dagger as it was being forged.</p>
