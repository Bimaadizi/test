<p>Eiverbreen Parrafin was the father of Spider Parrafin (the reborn Regis ).</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Eiverbreen was a drunkard. He used his son's natural skills as a deep-sea diver as a source of income for himself.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1463 DR , Eiverbreen's wife Jolee gave birth to a son. Jolee died during the birth and Eiverbreen never recovered from the grief. In order to see if his son had genasi blood in him, he attempted to drown him in the sea.</p>
<p>He refused to give his son a name and became a drunkard, neglecting his son in impoverished conditions until his son was old enough to choose his own name ( Spider ) and earn money for his father. Eiverbreen arranged for Spider to collect oysters for Pericolo Topolino , who in turn provided room and board (and free alcohol) at the Lazy Fisher for Eiverbreen.</p>
