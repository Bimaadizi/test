<p>The Gates of Sule were twin pillars of stone near the southern edge of Raurin , close to the Dustwall Mountains . The Sandvoyagers Track passed between these monoliths.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Apparently natural, the two rocks rested on each other, slanted at odd angles; they were pockmarked, eroded by the environment. The pillars carried an inscription cursing those who entered unbidden. However, there were sinkholes on both sides of the gap between the stones; those who tried to go around them were in deadly risk of being sucked under the sand.</p>
