<p>Achtel Gnarlfingers was a shaman of Gruumsh who represented the largest tribe in attendance during the destruction of Shallows .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Achtel dressed in colorful robes and wore a deep red traveling cloak. She owned a bright yellow sash that she wrapped around her shoulder to her waist. She carried a highly enhanced scepter, which had a skull on its end. She had shaggy brown hair.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1370 DR , Achtel's chieftain gathered over six hundred orcs to rally to Obould Many-Arrows 's cause, mainly to fight the dwarves of Mithral Hall . Achtel tried to dissuade the chieftain, and she was hesitant about the move. After the fall of the town of Shallows, a fellow shaman, Arganth Snarrl , proclaimed that Obould was in fact a god -king. Achtel was the sole shaman to not be persuaded by the charismatic and intelligent shaman. Arganth believed the tribes should unite under Obould, but Achtel, who headed the largest force of orcs, wished to stay independent.</p>
<p>Later, the renegade drow , Drizzt Do'Urden , slew Achtel Gnarlfingers. As Achtel appeared to have been singled out, the wise Arganth used this advantage to push his philosophy. Arganth's vision spread throughout the land, eventually catching the attention of Obould himself.</p>
