<p>Soldier's Memorial was an area within the Pauper's Section of Neverdeath Graveyard in Neverwinter where military veterans were interred.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1479Â DR , a group of doomguides belonging to the Eternal Order of Kelemvor were lured into a trap by Thayan necromancers seeking to capture them for use in dark rituals. These captives were then kept within Soldier's Memorial.</p>
<p>Sometime in the 1480s DR, members of the Cult of the Dragon who followed Severin Silrajin sought the remains of Cruven Gantara . In their efforts to find him, they sought the remains of his close associate, Belast Messandar , who had been interred in Soldier's Memorial along with his closest allies having served in several campaigns. The Harpers coordinated efforts to thwart the Cult, and led by an agent named Boward , attempted to obscure the location of Messandar's final resting place.</p>
