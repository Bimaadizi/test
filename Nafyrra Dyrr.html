<p>Nafyrra Dyrr was a member of House Agrach Dyrr of Menzoberranzan until 1372 .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nafyrra commanded a contingent of 80 warriors, mostly of her house, at the Rhazzt's Dilemma outpost in order to detect enemies arriving during the Silence of Lolth . Duergars and tanarukk bypassed Nafyrra and her troops and captain Zhayemd later reported that she and her soldiers were all killed. However, this was all a lie because the truth was that House Dyrr had allied with the invaders.</p>
