<h2>History</h2>
<p>Supposedly, he was born in a small log hut.</p>
<p>He eloped with the human daughter of one Guirath Moondock ; she was short enough that she could almost pass for a halfling herself. They married and had a petite half-human half-halfling daughter. She in turn married a human man, and their son was Jasper , who lived in Ghars , Cormyr , by 1366 DR . Jasper aspired to be halfling rogue like his "Grandpaw Hurthkin".</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>According to his grandson Jasper, Hurthkin liked to take advantage of humans as much as any halfling.</p>
