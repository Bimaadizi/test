<p>Mount Waterdeep was the name of the mountain on and around which the city of Waterdeep was built. It was a rough, rocky mountain and stood some 700 feet (210 meters) above the sea level, to the west of the city. Beneath the mountain was the notorious Undermountain . The whole of Mount Waterdeep was considered to be in the Castle Ward .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Mount Waterdeep shielded the city from the worst coastal storm winds. Inside the heart of the mountain there was a freshwater spring, that once spewed out and down its seaward rocks and into the sea below. Later on this spring was redirected into large-cistern caverns that were built into the upper reaches of the mountain, which then went down pipes into the city's sewer system .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>There was a ballad that spoke an ancient city sunk into the sea and the gods raised a head stone for it to mark the grave. That was Mount Waterdeep.</p>
<p>Mount Waterdeep was once home to the underhalls of Melairbode , a shield dwarf hold.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
