<p>Thalas was an elvish lute -playing bard from Evereska who found himself in the Ten-Towns in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Thalas was a slender and spindly elf with red hair and long thin fingers.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Thalas had a fear of public speaking, something that made his bardic aspirations problematic. He was a nervous man and even conversing with a stranger was hard for him, however, he only felt comfortable when singing.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Born in Evereska, Thalas departed his home to travel Faer√ªn , learn of the world and hone his art. He hoped that music and performing would help conquer his social anxiety. In Mirtul of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Thalas ended up in Targos , just as the Ten Towns faced strife and the town was flooded with refugees. He found temporary home in Luskan Arms inn of Targos and wanted to perform his songs in the taproom once confident enough.</p>
