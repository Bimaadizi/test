<p>Wyler's Bell was a small and nondescript inn found in Phlan in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The inn was located near the center of the city.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The inn was in fact little more than a cheap dive with a large common room for guests to sleep in on the second floor. The bland food and cheap ale attracted customers with little coin to spend.</p>
<p>Named for the former owner Nat Wyler , the inn's biggest attraction was the body of the deceased Old Nat himself that was displayed as a piece of mortuary art behind the bar gripping a bronze bell in his hands.</p>
