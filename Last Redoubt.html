<p>The Last Redoubt was a war camp established during the Siege of Helm's Hold circa the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was used as a staging point by the Neverwinter Guard and their allied forces to launch their ground assaults against the fortress-city of Helm's Hold , while it was held by the Prophet Rohini and the Ashmadai .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The camp was located just west of Helm's Hold , separated from the city by the the Blasted Battlefield that was largely overrun by devils and Ashmadai cultists.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>While there was no city officials in the camp to speak of, the guard's forces were led by Captain Dunfield of the Neverwinter Guard, who was supported by Brother Theodosian of the local Helmite clergy.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Several merchants set up stalls within the camp, including Thoroar the Mediogre .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The camp was sparsely defended save for wooden palisades and tall lookout towers manned by archers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was the Last Redoubt that Captain Dunfield fell back to after his first failed assault to take back Helm's Hold. After regrouping he worked with the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge to reconnect pockets of resistance found across the battlefield and throughout the city, and unite them in striking out against the devils of the Nine Hells and reclaiming the city of Helm .</p>
