<p>Around 1480 DR, the Red Wizard of Thay Arvik Zaltos instructed Thord Ironaxe , his son Grit , and Lump to go to Daggerford to help his apprentice Darwa Dalion to recover the earth key from inside the Ambergul Crypt .</p>
<p>However, when Darwa, Thord, and the others found the altar to Ogremoch , she tried to unlock the earth key by force and a magical trap turned her into stone. It also struck Scratches.</p>
<p>So Thord went back together with Grit and Lump, but Thord was captured by some minotaurs who wanted to cook and eat him.</p>
<p>Only Lump and Grit made it back to Illefarn with the earth key.</p>
<p>After giving the key to the Red Wizards, Lump went to his room to cry for Scratches's fate.</p>
