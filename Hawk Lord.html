<p>The hawk lord (also rendered as Hawk Lord ) was one of the Animal Lords , near- godlike spirits inhabiting the Beastlands that had dominion over all animals of their type. The hawk lord held dominion over all hawks across the Prime Material and Upper Planes .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like all Animal Lords, the hawk lord had two forms she could switch between. One was a beautiful human woman, standing roughly 6 feet (1.8 meters), exhibiting charismatic features and subtle characteristics of a hawk. She carried herself with a great deal of confidence and nobility.</p>
<p>In her animal form, the Hawk Lord appeared as a large hawk with a massive wingspan and distinctive markings, an ideal specimen of the species.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Like other Animal Lords, the hawk lord was exceptionally intelligent, but amoral and uncaring when it came to affairs outside of those related to the animal type they had dominion over. Almost never playing favorites. With the driving force of their will being nature itself and the need to protect it from the ravages of civilization.</p>
<p>Unlike most of the other lords though, the hawk lord took great pleasure in interacting with humans.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The hawk lord possessed all the innate abilities common among the Animal Lords. This included a natural form of telepathy or ESP that was always active, a danger sense that bordered on precognition, an immunity to charm -related spells , a partial magic resistance , the ability to summon two to twelve of the animal type they had dominion over (hawks), an ability to cast antimagic shell three times per day, and the ability to cast plane shift and teleport .</p>
<p>Taking after hawks, she had incredible eyesight and was very swift. She lacked any skills with weaponry and was overall not a great combatant in her human form, but was capable of casting charm person seven times per day. She preferred to fight in her hawk form, particularly favoring to divebomb opponents from over 100 feet (30 meters) or higher, and striking with tremendous claws that slashed like a +2 weapon. If ever killed, her essence would transfer to another hawk far away, either on the same plane or another.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>In her human form the hawk lord frequently chose to walk the lands of man and converse with people, but her day-to-day affairs revolved around hawks. She also frequently showed up whenever hawks on the Prime Material or Upper Planes were endangered by humanoids or fleeing their homeland.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The hawk lord was a close ally of Aerdrie Faenya , one of the Elven deities that was worshiped on Toril , and was her closest ally among the avian Animal Lords.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Some believed that the hawk lord knew the disposition of hawks across all the planes and even across all the worlds on the Prime Material.</p>
