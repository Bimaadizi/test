<p>A pole of collapsing was a magical 10-foot pole .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When a special command word was spoken, this 10‑foot (3‑meter) tall pole was able to telescopically collapse into a rod with a length of 1‑foot (0.3‑meter). The weight of the pole was unchanged. The pole was restored to its original length when the individual spoke another command word. If the individual was in a small space, the pole only lengthened as far the width or height of the space.</p>
