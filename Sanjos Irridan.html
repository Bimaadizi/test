<p>The Sanjos Irridan was a vampire necromancer and surgeon who sold undead grafts at the Corpse Market in the Shadowfell city of Evernight as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was evil and insane.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He sold body parts, including those which were magically animated and could be grafted onto a living person. These included everything from limbs to organs. Such specimens were known to be hard to procure as they had to be removed from (often unwilling) undead creatures without being damaged. He would also perform the actual grafting of the body part onto a client for an extra fee. This required a complicated and vile ritual that no sane or reasonable person would generally wish for.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of 1479Â DR , Sanjos Irridan was the most famous provider of grafts at the Corpse Market. A large banner over his shop proudly displayed the slogan: "an arm and a leg for less than an arm and a leg."</p>
