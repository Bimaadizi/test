<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thaleste was born in Menzoberranzan as a member of a noble house. However, around 1373 DR , she angered her matron mother , who then poisoned Thaleste. She barely survived and escaped, going to Skullport in search of a cure.</p>
<p>However, Thaleste took a wrong turn and blundered into the Promenade of the Dark Maiden . There she was healed and decided to join the Church of Eilistraee .</p>
<p>In 1375 DR , she was with the Darksong Knight Cavatina Xarann in her first patrol duty on the eastern fringes of the promenade.</p>
<p>During the patrol, while Cavatina was busy with a spellgaunt , Thaleste was attacked by an aranea cleric of Selvetarm . Cavatina however managed to arrive in time to save Thaleste's life.</p>
<p>Later, Thaleste went back to check the place of the attack and found a secret passage. She followed it without telling this to anyone, and while inside she was attacked and killed by a carrion crawler .</p>
