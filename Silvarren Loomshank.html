<p>Silvarren Loomshank was a priest of Helm from Neverwinter in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A resident of Neverwinter all his life, Silvarren was ordered by his superiors to attend to the Allfaiths Shrine in Red Larch after 1485 DR . He was meant to relieve Imdarr Relvaunder as per schedule. He instead stopped in Triboar , spending his days drinking at the Talking Troll tavern and sleeping it off in the corner of the common room, ignored by the other patrons.</p>
<p>Once Silvarren was several days late, and having heard a rumor his fellow priest was just getting drunk there, Imdarr hired adventurers to go to Triboar to check on him and move him on and remind him of his duty. By this point, Silvarren had used up all his traveling funds, and racked up a bar tab of 5 gold pieces , and couldn't or would've leave until it was paid off. This was more likely to be achieved by the adventurers, and they might've persuaded him to continue on to Red Larch.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Miserable and self-pitying, Silvarren considered himself hard-done-by as a result of "temple politics" and to have been "banished" from his city. He had lost faith in himself and in the decisions of his superiors, but not in his god. He tried to forget his misery through alcohol.</p>
