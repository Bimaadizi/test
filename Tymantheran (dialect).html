<p>Tymantheran was a regional Draconic dialect spoken by the dragonborn of Tymanther . Tymantheran words sounded softer than normal Draconic, a little more nasal and with words that had elongated syllables. There were words in Tymantheran that had no direct translation in the Common tongue.</p>
<p>Tymantheran dialect was based on the Aklave , the draconic dialect from Abeir , rather than from its Torilian variant.</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>It was considered by the dragonborn that they had "stolen" the language of the dragons during their years of slavery.</p>
