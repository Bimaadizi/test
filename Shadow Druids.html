<p>The Shadow Druids were a militant sect of druids that operated throughout the Sword Coast and Amn during the 14 th and 15 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The druidic circle as a whole was led by the Shadow Archdruid , while "First Druids" served as the leaders of individual groves.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Their guiding belief was that there was a long and endless struggle between people and nature. The tenets of their order were outlined in Faldorn's Canticle: The Shadow Druid's Doctrine .</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>They used extreme methods and violence to drive away civilization, using the ferocious powers of nature.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , the druids operated out of the Cloak Wood forest on the Sword Coast. By the following year , the group had taken over and established themselves within a druidic grove to the south in Amn .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Faldorn and her druids commanded animals of the forest to harry and assault the city of Trademeet .</p>
<p>The Shadow Druids continued their operations for well over a century, carrying out their deeds in the name and memory of their founder Faldorn . They remained active in the Cloak Wood and carried out operations throughout the Sword Coast.</p>
<h3>15 th Century</h3>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , there emerged the threat of a growing horde of goblinoids , allied with drow , gnolls , and other monstrous creatures, which endangered druidic enclaves across the Sword Coast. Under the supervision of Aelis , three druids of their order, Olodan , Pinta , and Wren , infiltrated the Emerald Grove near the River Chionthar and took great pains to "protect" the grove from the rampaging goblins.</p>
<p>The group managed to corrupt the spirit of Kagha , a senior member of the grove's druids, and manipulate her into carrying out the Rite of Thorns . The powerful ritual would encase the Emerald Grove in a thicket of vines and brambles, shielding it away from any outsiders. The Shadow Druids would then take control of the grove itself, to further ensure its safety.</p>
