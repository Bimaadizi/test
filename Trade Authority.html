<p>The Trade Authority was an organization made of the eleven most influential chakas in Vaelan , those which paid for its upkeep. It kept embassies or offices in multiple cities, and gave members of its families, even those not in good standing, certain perks such as free passage in their ships. Warian Datharathi took such a ship to reach Vaelan in Tarsakh of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR .</p>
