<p>Tellik Melarn was a drow priest of Vhaeraun , known as a Nightshadow, and a member of House Melarn in Ched Nasad in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationship</h2>
<p>Tellik was the younger brother of Q'arlynd Melarn . They were very close to each other, enough for Q'arlynd to think first of his brother when asked about close family members.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tellik was a cleric of Vhaeraun and invited his brother to attend a meeting of fellow members of the church of Vhaeraun .</p>
<p>At some point, he made a major transgression against his faith by impersonating his god's avatar . He was punished for it by the illusion being made permanent and so he couldn't hide it, which was dangerous because it would have revealed his link to the church of Vhaeraun for everyone in the Lolth -dominated city of Ched Nasad.</p>
<p>He came to his brother, who was a wizard , and begged him for help. Q'arlynd wasn't able to lift the curse, owing to his lack of skill. So he proposed to turn Tellik invisible to allow his escape out of the city. But instead of turning him invisible, Q'arlynd made his brother unconscious and sold him to his mother, Drisinil Melarn , as a traitor for sacrifice to Lolth. He was rewarded for his loyalty to Lolth by being allowed to attend his brother's sacrifice as a spectator. Tellik died painfully over a long period of time while being gradually cut into little pieces. Q'arlynd would come to regret not giving him a quick and simple death.</p>
