<p>Snow goggles were a type of eyewear designed to protect one's eyes in arctic environments.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These goggles had narrow, horizontal slits in the middle for the eyes to see through. They were typically made from either wood or bone sourced from caribou antlers.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Snow goggles provided their wearer protection against the blinding effects of snow, extremely bright light, or spells that targeted vision indirectly, such as sunburst . However, they narrowed the wearer's field of vision, rendering one unable to see either above or below themselves unless they shifted their head.</p>
