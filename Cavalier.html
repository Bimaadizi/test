<p>Cavaliers were the virtuous warriors of the more civilized Realms who acted as champions of righteousness and justice. Quite often they were noble-born individuals who lived their lives in service to a knightly order or ruling lord.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>These individuals personified the virtues of camaraderie and exuberance. Cavaliers extolled the deeds of their allies to everyone – occasionally to the annoyance of others. They armed themselves with the acclaim and faith of the people in their communities, and upheld that trust in all their deeds. Due to their social standing and the good will they fostered, cavaliers were typically empowered to petition aid from others in times of great need.</p>
<p>Cavaliers were the epitome of chivalry and were bounded to the strictness of its codes. They were required by their code of honor to aid others whenever possible; keep true to their word, as it was the law of the land; demonstrate deference to the superior nobility, as well courtesy and gallantry to those of lesser standing; and above all else, defend the people of their lands.</p>
<p>Cavaliers who venerated the god Tempus held the virtue of battle above all others.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The bravery of cavaliers knew no bounds and fear had no effect on them in battle. They could readily bring out the courage in those they fought alongside. Cavaliers honed their minds to protect themselves from mind-affecting various spells and effects, particularly those that attempted weaken , hypnotise , charm , subjugate , and even compel them under pain of death .</p>
<p>A Cavalier's bravado precluded them from fighting at range or choosing "weak" opponents on the field of battle. They nearly always charged ahead towards whichever enemy combatant, terrible beast, or awful fiend appeared to be the greatest threat.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Due to their proclivity for mounted combat, cavaliers trained extensively in the use of the lance and other mounted weapons, such as a horseman's flail or pick . They were well-versed at wielding one-handed swords in combat.</p>
<p>They protected themselves with the strongest, most expensive armor that was readily available.</p>
<h2>Notable Cavaliers</h2>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>While in the court of King Azoun IV , the sage Zeboaster famously once said that chivalrous knights lived out their usefulness in Faerûn , during the age of adventurers. This statement earned him the nickname of "sage on the run" as he was quickly expelled from the court – likely due to the king's famous career as a cavalier of Cormyr .</p>
