To the east, the vale opened up into Adbar Run . To the west, the vale ended against the Night Trees forest (later part of the Glimmerwood and the foothills around Citadel Felbarr . The River Rauvin passed through the vale from the Cold Wood before going underground north of the Dead Orc Pass into the Rauvinheart caverns .</p>
