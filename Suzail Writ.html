<p>The Suzail Writ was a piece of Cormyrian Law put in place by King Azoun V in the midâ€“15 th century DR . The Writ bound the king to law, limited the powers of nobles, and elevated the common people by granting inalienable rights to all.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>King Azoun V was crowned King of Cormyr in the Year of Three Streams Blooded, 1384 DR , ending the period known as the Steel Regency of his aunt, Princess Alusair Obaskyr . The young king attempted to enact many reforms in the kingdom, including limiting the rights held by the nobility. These reforms failed as a result of the lack of political support by Alusair. Nevertheless, Azoun V would later be known as a great lawmaker. He placed the Suzail Writ into law near the end of his reign, finally succeeding in limiting noble rights as he had intended, and agreeing to bind the monarchy under the Law.</p>
<p>Like his father, King Foril I remained a strong proponent and staunch defender of the Writ. By the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , 30 years into Foril's rule, most nobles had accepted the new status quo. However, a few still sought to return their noble houses to prominence, scheming to either win influence over the throne, or to even win the throne itself.</p>
<p>On top of binding the ruling classes and elevating the common people, the Writ made changes to the government of the city of Suzail , which Lord Magister Edwin Morahan sought to institutionalize as his primary goal by the late 15 th century DR. Because of this, Morahan was unjustly perceived to be biased towards commoners, which led many nobles to seek to oust him from his post.</p>
<h2>Provisions</h2>
<h3>Trials</h3>
<p>The Suzail Writ granted inalienable rights to the common folk of Cormyr, meaning all who were considered "free citizens." Notable among these rights was the right to trial by a jury of peers. Previously, that right had been exclusive to the nobles of the realm.</p>
<p>In this trial system, guilt and innocence was only determined at the end of the process and left in question until a verdict had been made. The losing party could appeal to the Crown, who could accept or reject such plea, and in case of acceptance, either name a minister to hear it, or have it be heard directly by the king.</p>
<h3>War Wizards</h3>
<p>Intricately worded portions of the Writ, compounded with other factors, greatly limited the ability of the War Wizards to monitor the thoughts and intentions of the nation's citizenry through magical means.</p>
<h2>Opposition</h2>
<p>Due to its role in limiting the rights held by Cormyr's nobility, not all noble houses accepted the Suzail Writ. House Illance were vocal opponents of the Writ, and House Wintersun also detested it, viewing it as an affront. It was in that context that House Dracohorn attempted to shift power away from the Crown and into a council of ruling nobles, using opposition to the Suzail Writ to make alliances with the aforementioned families. Whether these houses would join the Dracohorn's treasonous efforts remained to be seen by the 1480s DR.</p>
