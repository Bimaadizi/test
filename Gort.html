<p>In the Year of the Behir, 1342 DR , Gort visited the sage Othiiyr Velthrann of Tsurlagol, a noted expert on the Royal Guard's swords. Othiiyr identified Ellendrin and offered to buy it, but Gort refused, hinting that a contact in the Moonsea had already contracted him to retrieve it, and that he was leaving for their immediately.
