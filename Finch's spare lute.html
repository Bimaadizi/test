<p>Finch's spare lute was an enchanted lute that belonged to the daring half-elven bard Finch in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Finch's spare lute was lightly enchanted to boost its owner's ability to perform and their manual dexterity.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Finch's spare lute was accompanying its master across the Faerûn and into the struggle against the Forktongue Cultists on the Sword Coast and in Samarach . Even though the bard's main instrument was his voice and its ability to deliver "memorable and nuanced performances," Finch always packed his spare lute into the travel backpack for the moments when his voice needed a break or when he had to lay low and out of sight, pretending to be a simple commoner minstrel .</p>
