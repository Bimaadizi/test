<p>Berserkers were those fighters and barbarians who could tap into a particularly savage aspect of themselves in order to skip into a furious rage while in combat. Barbarians that followed the Path of the Berserker saw their rages as the best means to enjoy the thrill of battle, regardless of personal well-being.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Tribal berserkers were believed to have been granted supernatural forces that allowed them to better defend their people. These individuals lived in close-knit groups, often found in less-civilized locales. They looked out for their own kind within these communities.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Berserkers focused their efforts on honing their skill with melee weapons and forewent training with those wielded at long range . Similarly, they eschewed most types of armor more cumbersome than splint mail .</p>

Once in this state a berserk fought with exceptional strength and ferocity. They could not be knocked out, were immune to a wide-range of mind-controlling spells and effects, and gained resistance to others that attempted to hinder their movement or actions. This fighting style was just as unpredictable as it was effective in battle.</p>
<p>A berserker's rage lasted until every enemy on the battlefield was downed. On occasion they could not differentiate friend from foe and would attack those who were in fact their allies. Afterwards, a berserker became physically exhausted and vulnerable to certain effects they shrugged off during their rage.</p>
<p>The sight of a veteran berserker in battle was so terrifying that some combatants fled from the battlefield entirely.</p>
<h2>Notable Berserkers</h2>
<p>The Rashemaar berserkers comprised several tribes of fearsome warriors from the far- eastern realm of Rashemen .</p>
