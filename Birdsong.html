<h2>History</h2>
<p>When she was very young, Birdsong's village was destroyed and enslaved by yuan-ti . Although she grew up as a slave , Birdsong quickly discovered she had a talent for the bardic arts. Playing her lute, Birdsong's music had a profound effect on her fellow slaves. After escaping the yuan-ti slavers, Birdsong vowed to one day get revenge. She became known as one of the greatest minstrels in all of Chult.</p>
<p>During the events of the death curse , Birdsong allied herself with the likes of the jungle guide Eku , the adventurers Artus Cimber and Dragonbait , the aarakocra elder Asharra , and the druid Qawasha to help investigate and stop the curse.</p>
<p>On or just before the 14th of Alturiak that followed the appearance of the death curse, Birdsong was traveling with a merchant caravan from Port Nyanzaru to Camp Vengeance when they were attacked by a flesh golem . The survivors were rescued by an old woman named Nanny Pu'pu and given shelter at her home in Mbala , only for it to be revealed that the old woman was in fact a green hag . The merchants were all killed with the exception of Birdsong, who was kept as a prisoner to entertain the hag before she was rescued by adventurers sent to look for her by a concerned Vanessa.</p>
