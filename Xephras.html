<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Xephras was a short cloud giant . He was several hundred years old and had a stooped figure with long white hair and a beard.</p>

<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As the Great Priest of Annam All-Father , Xephras was the highest religious figure in giant society. In his old age, because of his sickly physical condition, he was unable to attend as many rituals and ceremonies as he would have liked in order to fulfill his duties as stormazîn . He would step down when he had found a successor.</p>
