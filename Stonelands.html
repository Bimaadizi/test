<p>The Stonelands were a range of desolate plains and moorlands that extended north and south of the Storm Horns mountain range, lying between Anauroch and Cormyr . Its northern extents joined the Goblin Marches and High Moors in a narrow band of habitable lands south of the Anauroch desert, forming an infamous region inhabited by countless tribes and monsters of all kinds.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Stonelands consisted of dry plains and hills that had a harsh beauty to them, marked by knife-edged ridges, deep ravines, caverns and overhangs. The term was broadly and confusingly applied to two semi-distinct areas: the uninhabited lands of Cormyr south of the Storm Horns, encompassing the wilderness north of Eveningstar and Arabel that ran into the foothills of the Storm Horns, and the harsher hills and wastelands north of the Storm Horns that bordered on the Anauroch desert.</p>
<p>The southern Stonelands lay entirely within the traditional borders of Cormyr, formed of a rough plateau of broken, treacherous ground north of the High Road starting with the Stonecliff 's limestone escarpment, transitioning to the granite foothills of the Storm Horns. The Helmlands made up a significant portion of the region following the Time of Troubles , turning a large part of the southern Stonelands into a dangerous and unstable region of tar pits, wild magic and dead magic zones. Following the Spellplague , the Helmlands expanded across much of the southern Stonelands.</p>
<p>The northern Stonelands were what people generally referred to when they meant the Stonelands, as they were far more wild and inhospitable than the south. The eastern bounds were roughly delineated by the Moonsea Ride , though the wilderness was not really distinguished from the rolling plains of the upper Immerflow and Tilver's Gap , or the foothills of the Thunder Peaks . The northern edge of the Stonelands blended with the lower-lying Desertsedge of Anauroch, which consisted largely of dry rocky hills. The dried-up river valley of Raudilauth divided the Stonelands from Alauthwaerd the Watcher, the southernmost peak of the Desertsmouth Mountains , and provided a passable trail into Anauroch . The western edge merged with the bogs, hills, and broken ground of the Goblin Marches , while the High Moors rose to the south along the foothills of the Storm Horns.</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>The Eastern Storm Horns and Gnoll Peaks were great mountains that cut through the center of the Stonelands, and provided a natural barrier for Cormyr against threats from the north. They roughly divided the Stonelands into northern and southern halves, each with distinct regional qualities.</p>
<p>The northern Stonelands had poor soil consisting largely of dry clay unsuited to agriculture, but was mostly free of stones, instead named for the extraordinary rocks that protruded from the ground. These rocks varied in size from boulders to spires hundreds of feet tall, scattered haphazardly about the land with no apparent pattern. They appeared as if they had fallen with great force, with the larger ones often embedded in the ground at dangerous angles and looming threateningly over the landscape.</p>
<p>The southern Stonelands tended towards desolate, broken ground that rose from the Stonecliff and disappeared into the foothills of the Storm Horns. A great contrast to the low-lying fertile forests and plains of Cormyr, it comprised vast sweeping moors that were accentuated by stony tors. A great profusion of ravines, cliffs and streams broke up the terrain, making it difficult to travel across on foot and almost impossible by mount.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>The folk of northern Cormyr feared the Stonelands as a place that all kinds of monsters poured out of to harry them, from mundane wolves to chimerae , fire lizards , and hydras . In their original state, the Stonelands and Goblin Marches were pleasant green lands inhabited by natural predators and prey. Interference by successive magical and mundane forces gradually reduced the fertility of the land and the diversity of the biome, transforming it into a barren and deadly monster-infested wasteland. By the 14 th century DR, the Stonelands were on the brink of ecological collapse as humanoid tribes harvested what little remained and the dwindling biosphere became dominated by the strongest and most vicious predators.</p>
<p>The northern Stonelands had somewhat richer, less rocky soil than the nearby Goblin Marches, though this offered little advantage as the region was regularly struck by harsh storms and droughts. The flora largely consisted of hardy grasses, flowering weeds, prickly vines, scrub brush, mosses, lichen, and fungi. These flourished best in sheltered spots, especially in the shadows of the land's megaliths or growing upon their sides. Trees were uncommon and mostly grew around the edges of permanent streams and lakes, with their size severely curtailed by the harsh storms and unforgiving climate.</p>
<p>The natural fauna of the region was based on herds of antelope , deer , oxen , sheep , and goats that fed on the grasses, along with great flocks of birds and many other smaller animals such as badgers , foxes , and rabbits . These were preyed upon by bears , wolves, eagles , and giant owls , with rarer giant spiders and firedrakes acting as apex predators. This balance was broken by constant pressure put upon the land, from the magical influences of Netheril to the short-sighted hunting of goblinoid tribes, causing these creatures to largely die out or migrate away by the 14 th century DR.</p>
<p>The remaining herbivores tended towards their dire cousins , including dire badgers , dire porcupines , and dire skunks , as well as other megafauna such as titanotheres , axebeaks , baluchitherium , phororhacos , and woolly rhinoceros . New dominant predators of the land joined the resilient giant spiders and firedrakes, including behirs , chimerae , perytons , and hieracosphinxes , which took over caves and ruins for lairs and hunted the goblins and orcs who had depleted the land of other prey.</p>
<p>A few varieties of dinosaur lived within the Stonelands, though all were small ostrich -sized species. These included deinonychus , fleshrakers , swindlespitters , and velociraptors . All of these species hibernated in deep rifts near earth nodes and volcanic flows. They were never known to race along the heights of the Stonelands or ventured far from the region, as they feared being eaten by dragons , dark horrors , or Zhent foulwings .</p>
<p>Wolves were especially prevalent in the southern Stonelands, and harsh winters in northern Cormyr were called "wolf winters" for the packs that came down the Stonecliff to hunt. Wyverns were once far more common in the region, but by the 14 th century DR they had become rare, with their tails sought after as a delicacy in Cormyr.</p>
<h3>Climate</h3>
<p>The northern Stonelands near Anauroch were marked by a harsh, unforgiving climate, variously attributed to the nearby Storm Horns and Desertsedge Mountains, Anauroch desert, and ancient Netherese magic run amok. Humidity, temperature, and precipitation fluctuated wildly throughout the year, regularly causing local flooding and droughts, as well as occasional hot winters and cold summers.</p>
<p>Summers were generally blazingly hot and humid, punctuated by swift and sudden thunderstorms that lashed the land with torrential rain, hail, and continuous lightning strikes before disappearing. The land did not retain water well despite the heavy rain, so the water quickly drained and flowed north into Anauroch. Winters tended to be cold, windy and dry, with flurries of powdery snow that blew about like dust and rarely piled up. Autumn and spring were transitory periods which were less dry than winter and cooler than summer, providing brief respites. Thanks to the harshness of the climate, the landscape was largely unchanging throughout the year with only a short green period in spring before the sun baked the land brown again.</p>
<p>The thunderstorms sometimes took on an unnatural aspect, on average once every three years, presumed to be the lingering results of ancient magical experiments or battles. On these rare occasions it could rain fire, enormous icicle-like hailstones, or acid , potentially wiping out flora and fauna over miles of ground. On even rarer occasions, there were "storms" of antimagic , which drained the powers of exposed magical items caught in them, as well as storms of wild magic which could spontaneously generate magical items, mutate and transform creatures, or cause any other conceivable (or inconceivable) effect.</p>
<p>In contrast, the weather in the southern Stonelands was relatively mild. They were usually wreathed in mists, that were blown away by the high winds accompanying frequent but mundane storms.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Although Cormyr claimed the Stonelands as part of its territory, it could not control it beyond where its soldiers marched. The Crown offered generous rewards for those who could establish and maintain settlements in the region, including King Azoun IV , Steel Regent Alusair , and King Foril I . Many adventurers and ambitious nobles attempted to claim the prize of the Barony of the Stonelands, though none managed to secure the land.</p>
<p>The northern extents were an especially inhospitable place for "civilized" humanoids and was home to potentially hundreds of independent tribes and bands of orcs , goblinoids , and other creatures. The Zhentarim kept a level of influence in the region, hiring or bribing the local tribes and groups to avoid attacks, and directing them against Cormyrean settlements and routes.</p>
<p>Once part of Hlundadim , the descendants of the nation mostly settled in the Goblin Marches , but often hunted and raided across the Stonelands and High Moors as well.</p>
<p>Mercenaries , adventuring companies, and bandit gangs found plenty of things to do in the Stonelands, with locals and foreigners taking up the career.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The southern Stonelands were used by Cormyrean prospectors, game hunters, treasure-seekers and ranchers who could make a living from the wilderness. Arabel was the primary base of operations for these ventures, lending the big city a frontier feeling, with Eveningstar also serving as a gateway. Following the annexation of Tilverton , many of these frontier folk moved on to new opportunities that arose in the northern Stonelands and Tilver's Gap .</p>
<p>The area around Gnoll Pass was home to extensive coal mining operations, with bell pits common north of Arabel.</p>
<p>The closest thing to a trade route through the Stonelands was the Long Road to Riches , a Zhentarim caravan route that passed around the southern edge of Anauroch. Its success was dependent on their agents parleying or manipulating the locals.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Netheril & Hlundadim</h3>
<p>The southern frontier of Netheril received relatively little attention compared to that of the west , though serious efforts were made to conquer and colonize the Forest Country and beyond. At the time, the future Stonelands were wooded, part of the greater Cormanthor and Forest Country, and home to great numbers of orcs, goblinoids, and kobolds. As the frontier moved south, many of these humanoids were killed or driven away into the Forest Country and along the coast of the Inner Sea , and presented a consistent threat to Netheril. In 2573¬†NY (‚àí1286¬†DR) the Netherese founded the outpost of Blister in the northern Thunder Peaks , using it as a forward base for exploring and conquering the lands to the south. It was supported by a network of portals , including one in a Netherese outpost in the northern Stonelands, and the Laughing Head in the southern Stonelands. This intrusion was met by continual raids and skirmishes by the local humanoids, who were unable to directly strike at the fortress-city but over the centuries managed dominate the lands around it. Despite the great military and magical power of Netheril, it lost control of the region and the outlying portals were abandoned and hidden, though not deactivated. Blister managed to survive a surprise attack by phaerimms in 3417¬†NY (‚àí442¬†DR) with heavy losses, but it never recovered.</p>
<p>In the 3466¬†NY (‚àí393¬†DR) , in the midst of Netheril's decline and the spread of Anauroch, the Great Hlundadim rallied goblins , hobgoblins , gnolls , orcs , and kobolds into a great nation called Hlundadim . They proceeded to conquer the Windy Plains , Goblin Marches and Stonelands, and warred with their neighbors fiercely. Blister survived until 3547¬†NY (‚àí312¬†DR) , 27 years after Karsus's Folly , when it was destroyed and looted by kobolds. Following the fall of Netheril and Blister there was a great migration north of the displaced humanoids of the Forest Country and beyond, resettling in the Stonelands and Goblin Marches . The Stonelands became one of the regions variously settled and fought over by Hlundadim and the Lost Kingdoms , scattering it with fortifications and remnants of powerful magic.</p>
<p>Legends told that the great rock formations in the northern Stonelands were created circa ‚àí200¬†DR when Asram and Anauria attacked a realm that existed in the clouds of the region called Avaeraether , in order to escape the encroachment of the ever-expanding Anauroch desert. The castles built among the clouds crashed down to the earth, creating the unique stone formations after which it was named.</p>
<p>Hlundadim's armies destroyed Tarkhaldale in ‚àí87¬†DR and Anauria in 111 DR , giving it almost uncontested control over the lands north of the Storm Horns. They invaded a young Cormyr in 198 DR and razed Arabel , but were defeated by King Moriann Obarskyr in 200 DR .</p>
<h3>Post-Hlundadim</h3>
<p>The realm was destroyed in the Year of the Cruel Storms, 268 DR when great dust storms and desertification struck the Windy Plains, absorbing it into the Great Sand Sea. The Great Hlundadim disappeared and his former subjects fled south, disintegrating into warring bands. Although they eventually returned and rebuilt, the realm was forever broken.</p>
<p>A second wave of desertification in 1038 DR brought the desert south again to the edge of the Stonelands and Goblin Marches, destroying much of what had been rebuilt and drying out the local climate further. Hundreds of thousands of goblins, orcs, and other victims of the environmental catastrophe rallied under the warlord Izac Uthor in 1090 DR and marched west, intending to conquer the whole of the North , only to be destroyed in a huge battle at what would become known as the Battle of Bones .</p>
<p>The 12 th century DR saw the rise of the bandit warlord Rivior , who built a large keep and extensive underground fortifications in the southern Stonelands. He was defeated and killed by Queen Enchara of Esparin , whose realm was also built in the Stonelands. Queen Enchara went on to marry Prince Palaghard Obarskyr I in 1162 DR , resulting in the union of Cormyr and Esparin into a single realm.</p>
<h3>14th Century</h3>
<p>King Rhigaerd Obarskyr II waged a great campaign against the border raiders during his time, bringing a period of peace to the realm. However, the threat from the Stonelands remained during the reign his son King Azoun IV , and resulted in the construction of Castle Crag in Gnoll Pass beginning around 1347 DR , which remained under construction for at least a decade onwards. It went on to become a major strongpoint and garrison for Cormyr's border, effectively halting raiders from entering Cormyr proper from the north.</p>
<p>In 1352 DR , Gondegal 's war spread into the Stonelands as he engaged in hit-and-run strikes on Cormyrean forces. One such unit, the Twilight Brigade , razed the village of Darkenshield and slaughtered the inhabitants. At the same time, the Starburst Swords Purple Dragons sought to avoid combat with the Twilight Brigade, only to be ambushed by trolls and devoured. The inhabitants of the then-unruined nearby Tower of Ruin refused to aid them, resulting in both groups being shunned by Torm and facing judgment for their cowardice.</p>
<p>The bandit lord Jhassilm Onespear held a citadel in the Stonelands, before it was stormed by the mercenary Brandon some time before 1356 DR .</p>
<p>In 1356 DR , aggression by orcish tribes, Lashan Aumersair , and Zhentil Keep resulted in Cormyr preemptively annexing Tilverton , securing the whole eastern edge of the Stonelands. Purple Dragons were then able to patrol in force to Tilver's Gap and beyond, severely curtailing the Zhentarim's operations in the region and the ability of others to raid at will.</p>
<p>During the Time of Troubles , in Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Bane reformed the ruins of Castle Kilgrave into an intact and unnatural fortress, and imprisoned Mystra inside. Caitlan Moonsong and Midnight freed her and Bane withdrew his power, causing the divinely-sustained fortress to vanish and be returned to a crumbling ruin. Mystra then attempted to force her way past Helm to the Celestial Stairway , only to be violently destroyed by him. The force of her death turned Castle Kilgrave to dust completely and burned the land around it, leaving only an intact circle of stone foundations where Midnight had stood.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Lord Vorik Aris had accrued an army of mercenaries and secured Wyvernwatch Castle , planning on using them to raid the border regions of Cormyr in preparation for a larger campaign that would see him crowned King. He marched on the ruins of Darkenshield, but his forces were destroyed by a group of adventurers who summoned the vengeful spirits of the residents and the duty-bound Starburst Swords, ending his ambitions.</p>
<p>Also in 1369 DR, Princess Alusair operated in the Stonelands, and commanded a troop of twenty-four young noble knights in pursuit of a bold orc band that had raided a caravan east of Eveningstar . In six days of pursuit, they killed a hydra , a fire lizard , and three chimerae . North of Startop Peak , the knights impetuously pursued the orcs into an ambush, and a few were killed before Alusair rallied them to defeat the orcs. They deduced the orcs served a dark naga and the Zhentarim , who had been charming and transporting monsters into the area. Alusair and her knights defeated the naga and destroyed the gate before it could disgorge another monster, and resolved to seek out and destroy the other gates.</p>
<p>In mid- 1372 DR , Purple Dragons at the Black Crater spotted orcish raiders a few miles off the Moonsea Ride at an old Netherese ruin . This led to adventurers hired by the Crown discovering the still-functional portal within, and the rest of the Blister portal network.</p>
<p>Following the official crowning of Azoun V as King in 1389 DR , Alusair's regency ended and she abandoned the court, spending most of her time in the Stonelands and other frontiers. She returned for her mother 's funeral in 1390 DR , then vanished into the wilderness again, never returning. She died fighting on the frontier shortly after, and became a duty-bound ghost tied to Cormyr.</p>
<h3>15th Century</h3>
<p>During the war between Thultanthar and Cormyr in 1486 DR , Lady Marsheena drove goblins , gnolls , and monsters out of the Stonelands and into Cormyr, causing them to rampage through the countryside. At the same time, an army of Shadovar invaded through a portal in the Forgotten Keep , bypassing Castle Crag and the other defenses of Cormyr, going on to besiege Arabel , Marsember , and Suzail . In early Nightal , the portal in the Forgotten Keep was sealed by the War Wizards and the Shadovar army destroyed, ending the invasion.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>The northern Stonelands were littered with the ruins of old settlements and fortifications, most of which came from the Netherese realms of Anauria and Asram , as well as some of Hlundadim . Later ruins came from successive waves of explorers and colonizers who then fell to the perils of the Stonelands, which ultimately gave the Stonelands a high density of ruined structures. Regardless of the origin, the ruins were used as homes and hideouts for tribes and gangs, as well as lairs for monsters. The known ruins were poor prospects for treasure hunters by the 14 th century DR , as they had long been picked clean and only contained dangerous residents.</p>
<p>The southern Stonelands were home to a number of old ruins, many built by those who sought to take land on the poorly-controlled borderlands of Cormyr. The Stonecliff in particular had a preponderance of abandoned wizard's abodes in caves or crumbling towers, drawing forth a regular stream of treasure-hunters seeking magical riches.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<h3>Humanoids</h3>
<p>The northern Stonelands were famously home to dozens of tribes of orcs , goblins , and hobgoblins . These tribes shared a common origin with those of the Goblin Marches and High Moors from the ancient realm of Hlundadim . The martial legacy of Hlundadim granted many of these groups a level of technical and magical expertise that belied their primitive circumstances, while the legends of the realm's supremacy inspired them to rebuild and expand their lands, driving an aggression that would not have been present otherwise. The various races frequently hired each other as mercenaries or cohabited with each other, with monoracial tribes and settlements quite uncommon.</p>
<p>The goblin tribes tended to raise and live alongside wolves , dire wolves , and worgs , treating them not as pets but as family members. They kept slaves that were mostly goblins with a minority of other humanoids, though humans usually died rapidly from the poor living conditions and forced labor. Their settlements tended to be caves and old structures that they expanded with tunnelling, improving on the defenses with traps and cunning architecture learned in Hlundadim. Hobgoblins were once much more common, but declined significantly since the Battle of Bones and often lived as part of other tribes.</p>
<p>Orcish tribes were fairly common in the region, living in fortified wooden villages. They subsisted off hunting and farming, and mined iron that they used to forge their own tools, weapons, and armor. Their villages were usually home to other humanoids and giantkin as well, having them as martial reinforcements and marital prospects.</p>
<p>Kobolds and bugbears were quite rare in the region, preferring to live deeper in the Underdark and avoid trouble on the surface unless a profitable opportunity arose. Gnolls generally lived apart from all other peoples and were mostly found in unsettled tribes in the eastern Stonelands, led by flinds and accompanied by domesticated hyaenodons . They had a particular hatred for stone giants , who they believed slew the legendary gnoll Grrat and forever doomed them to insignificance. Wemics made up a small but notable population in the Stonelands, using stone and wood tools and migrating about in nomadic prides. Small groups of medusae and doppelgangers also made their homes in the hidden cave systems of the Stonelands, largely content to avoid notice by others.</p>
<p>More than a few human bandit gangs and malevolent wizards made their homes in the forbidding wasteland, and the Zhentarim often had agents in the region to spy, parley, or trade with the locals. The Zhentarim ran the Long Road to Riches around the edge of the Anauroch and made influencing the locals a priority, using diplomacy and bribery to ensure safety for their interests while directing aggression towards Cormyr and the Dalelands . They went so far as to use mind-controlled doppelgangers to take over entire tribes and raider groups, directing them towards specific goals without apparent outside influence. In the southern Stonelands, they had numerous agents in place who used ruins and caves to hide from Cormyrean forces, and performed patrols of their own on flying beasts, sometimes directly over Eveningstar . These operations began disintegrating in the mid-14 th century DR after Cormyr annexed Tilverton and the Purple Dragons were able to aggressively patrol more land.</p>
<p>Although it was normal for the inhabitants of the Stonelands to occasionally raid trade routes and settlements, some groups focused on this as their only occupation. These " border raiders " were highly aggressive and well-organized, striking regularly at humans in Cormyr and the Dales, elves in the Cormanthor , and dwarves in the Desertsmouth Mountains . They almost always contained multiple types of creature who fulfilled different specialities and offset each other's weaknesses, including any combination of goblinoids , orcs, giantkin , kobolds, and more. Most of these border raider groups were secretly controlled by the great red wyrm Grinnsira , who used her mastery of charm magic and a vast spy network to control her minions and ensure they performed well against their targets. She was actively opposed in these schemes by the silver dragon Fi Lendicol , and unwittingly sabotaged by the Zhentarim, who bribed her minions in unproductive directions or secretly replaced them with doppelgangers.</p>
<h3>Giants & Dragons</h3>
<p>Giantkin were not uncommon in the Stonelands, with many ettins and ogres finding work as warriors with tribes of humanoids or giants, with the ogres usually bullying and mistreating their orc or goblin employers. Despite this, the combination of ogres and orcs led to a growing population of ogrillons that were treated especially favorably by their orcish kin. Ettins got along well enough with the smaller creatures they met, and never enslaved them. Instead, they hired goblins and orcs as guards, hunters, or builders to improve their homes, and paid them generously in treasure. Trolls were rarer and normally lived in the Underdark , only coming up for profitable long-term work or opportunistic raids.</p>
<p>Small tribes of hill giants were common across the region, often working as mercenaries for humanoid tribes, and sometimes taking over if the idea struck them. Stone giants normally lived in the nearby mountains, but were also seen traveling through the Stonelands for unknown reasons. Cloud giants and storm giants were also seen more rarely on the ground, either gathering food or trading, with the two kinds working together amicably and keeping giant eagles as pets and rocs as mounts. They were believed to live in the Storm Horns to the south, as well as in Avaeraether , if it even existed.</p>
<p>Dragons were seen to lair or hunt in the region, with red dragons most common, and generally occupied with terrorizing victims (goblins) and avoiding those who could fight back (giants). Copper , amethyst and silver dragons were also seen in the region, usually for inscrutable reasons.</p>
