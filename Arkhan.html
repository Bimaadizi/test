<p>Arkhan the Cruel ( pronounced : /ˈ ɑːr k ɔː n / AR-kawn ) was a dragonborn oathbreaker paladin of Tiamat who lived in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>In battle, Arkhan carried the magical axe Fane-Eater and carried a dragonscale shield. He also owned the Wreath of the Prism , an amulet that granted him control over a vicious manticore called Chango .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After a brief visit to the world of Exandria , Arkhan replaced his left hand with a legendary artifact known as the Hand of Vecna , with the intention of using its power to free Tiamat from her prison in Avernus .</p>
<p>By the Year of Twelve Warnings, 1494 DR , Arkhan, having taken residence in a tower located near a monument dedicated to Tiamat in Avernus, had yet to succeed in his endeavor. Prolonged possession of the Hand of Vecna was slowly causing his left side to become corrupted, a process that could only be slowed down by sacrificing the life of good creatures.</p>
