<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Lorgyn and Bralatar managed to find a new gate to Faerûn . There, they discovered that the Great Foe of the malaugrym, Elminster , had been killed during the second battle of Shadowdale . So instead Bralatar and Lorgyn went to Sembia to collect magic from the wizards of that land. There they killed the wizard Mortoth and ran into their fellow malaugrym Lunquar , who was busy killing local Zhentarim . They decided to check Elminster's tower , hoping to find the secrets of Malaug .</p>
<p>Back at the Tower of Mortoth, however, Bralatar was killed in a sudden attack by Irendue Nuen-tar , the most promising apprentice of Mortoth. Lorgyn took Irendue captive. He then decided to collect mages and went to Tilverton to find new members for his collection.</p>
