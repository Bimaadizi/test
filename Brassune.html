<p>Brassune was a ruined genasi city located in western Akanûl in the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Brassune was the first city the genasi of Akanûl built after the Spellplague , atop the ruins of a Shyran city and the Chondathan city of Reth . Around 1400 DR , after nearly two decades of civil war among the nobles of the city, they decided to create the 'Covenant of Monarchy', appointing King Zavon as the first ruler of Akanûl.</p>
<p>However, in the Year of Ten Terrors, 1429 DR , Brassune was attacked by the Abolethic Sovereignty . The city was completely destroyed and the surviving inhabitants fled to the ruins of an abandoned Chessentan city, Airspur .</p>
<p>As of 1479 DR , the ruins of Brassune were still attacked by the minions of the Abolethic Sovereignty, and for this reason the Firestorm Cabal still watched over its ruins.</p>
