<p>An ancestral mound , or ancestor mound , was a holy place of utmost important to the tribal peoples of Faer√ªn .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Every Uthgardt tribe had an associated mound, which was fixed at a specific location. Here, they believed their founders of tribe were buried, and worshiped totems , particularly during Runemeet . An altar mound, carved into the shape of a tribe's totem beast, was placed in the centre of an ancestral mound.</p>
<p>Multiple tribes could share their ancestral mound, such as the Black Lion tribe and Red Tiger tribe , whose ancestral mound was Beorunna's Well . Other known mounds were: Raven Rock , the Great Worm Cavern , Flint Rock , Morgur's Mound , Stone Stand , Shining White and the Grandfather Tree .</p>
<p>Most family groups, or clans of a specific tribe, would live only a few weeks trek from their ancestral mound.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Tribal shamans could cast spells on such a mound to bring forth a ghostly apparition of an ancestor. Doing so was very beneficial, but also somewhat risky. Shamans who were not wise enough could become subject to the uncontrollable wrath of the ghost . However, if controlled successfully, the ghost could be made to guard the ancestor mound, or tell the shaman ancient tribal secrets.</p>
<p>When shamans of a tribe would pass away, their relics, as well as their remains, would be buried in the mound.</p>
