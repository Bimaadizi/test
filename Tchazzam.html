<p>The Tchazzam ( pronounced : /ˈ t tʃ ɑː z ʌ m / T CHAZ-um ) clan was part of the huge pantheon of nobility in Waterdeep in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . They were known for being excellent archers and hunters.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Lord Ulboth Tchazzam was the patriarch of the family from at least the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , to at least the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . He married Lady Lara Stormweather sometime after her previous husband, Lord Mintos Stormweather , passed away in Eleint of the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR . The designated heir was Ulboth's young brother Tarlon after Tarlon's older sister Carina was killed by some nefarious plot involving a family pet. As of 1372 DR, there were twenty-two living members of this noble family.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Tchazzam family were mainly followers of Mielikki , but were known to venerate allied gods as well. For example, they donated statues made from white marble to the House of the Moon that were displayed in the Narthex Cantoria.</p>
<p>As part of their expertise in archery and hunting, they also were expert bowyers and fletchers.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The walled villa they called home was located on the northeast corner of Diamond Street and Seawatch Street in the Sea Ward . It consisted of one- and two-story unique buildings surrounding a small green space. Directly across Diamond Street was Gournar's Tavern and the House of the Moon. Across Seawatch Street was the Wandering Wemic inn and their next-door neighbor on Seawatch Street was Dater's Inn . On the other side of the alley behind their property was Maerghoun's Inn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Tchazzam family were of Tethyrian descent and achieved recognition as nobles in the Year of the Persuasive Trees, 1149 DR .</p>
<p>In Tarsakh of the Year of the Horn, 1222 DR , Lord Ornigar Tchazzam was leading a hunting party from Waterdeep when they camped near the ruined tower in Starshadow Vale near the southwestern border of the High Forest . There, he was possessed by the ghost of Lord Erthaer Javilarhhsson , the Baron of Dauntylgar , the noble who built the tower in the late 7 th century DR. Under Erthaer's influence, Ornigar was obsessed with establishing a hold on the site of the ruins and he convinced several Watherdhavian noble families to invest in the project. A dozen young nobles and over a hundred hired hands returned to the site in autumn and quickly rebuilt Starshadow Tower with magical assistance. The new residents of the vale explored the environs and found barrows to plunder. Unfortunately, these were sacred to the Horned Lord and Tanglethorn tribes of orcs that lived in the High Forest. They mustered a horde and massacred the settlers in less than a tenday .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Helm, 1362 DR , Lord Corahk Tchazzam , Ulboth's only son, left Waterdeep and did not return when expected. After some time, the family believed him to be dead, but in fact he spent years hunting in the Moonwoods and eventually joined the Harpers . He was last known to be living in a residence he purchased in Silverymoon . Because of the assumed death of his son, Ulboth named his sister Carina as the new heir.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Carina Tchazzam was attacked and killed by her pet cat . Witnesses reported that it grew in size and its eyes glowed a bright green at the time of the attack. These telltale signs pointed to the beloved pet being transformed in to a beast of Xvim . Her younger brother, Tarlon, upon becoming the new heir to the family title, banned all cats from all properties they controlled.</p>
