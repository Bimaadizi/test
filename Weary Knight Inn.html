<p>The Weary Knight Inn was an inn and a tavern, average by all accords, located in the city of Arabel , Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The roadhouse stood across the street and to the east from the Citadel . The city's Eastgate was three blocks away. Immediately to the east from the Weary Knight Inn stood grand villa of the noble House Marliir and further west—the Lady's House , Arabel's temple of Tymora .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Weary Knight was a roadhouse with sizable stables attached to the main building.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The inn's rooms had strongly-smelling straw-filled mattresses. Some believed that the horses used the straw before it was used for stuffing. The establishment had several kitchens filled with smoke and aromas of cooking. The main huge dining area of the inn had high ceilings and held the inn's namesake next to a wall. The Weary Knight was an antique unopened carved tomb recovered from a temple pyre several centuries fever the 14 th century DR . The tomb was carved of stone with an image of a lying knight on the tomb's lid. The human knight's image was carved adorned in armor. His hand was placed on his chest while the other was at his side. From afar, the tomb looked like a sleeping man.</p>
<p>No one was allowed to touch or tamper with the sealed stone coffin. It was sealed with lead making it hard to pry open, and anyone who tried faced the wrath of Arabel's leader— Myrmeen Lhal .</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The most notable thing about the Knight was its pleasant and exuberant atmosphere. The innkeeper in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR was Alanaerle . She was a big woman with a face that scared children. Despite her looks, she was a pleasant company and a jolly host who loved sad love stories and ballads with happy endings. She never failed to fill the inn's common room with traveling minstrels , singers, bards , and storytellers. She cut prices in half in exchange for performances. This guaranteed the Knight filled with sorrowful ballads and lively tales on the daily.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The inn offered the usual service of food, drink, lodgings, and music to its guests. Alanaerle prepared a cozy parlor on the other side of the common room for those who considered sad ballads unappealing. Those who chose to eat there were spared from romantic moaning of overly-eloquent bards.</p>
<p>Regularly priced room and a meal costed guests two gold coins , while entertainers were charged only a single gold.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The famous adventuring troupe, Knights of Myth Drannor , in their earliest incarnation— at the time going by the "Swords of Eveningstar", visited the Weary Knight Inn in the Year of the Spur, 1348 DR . The over-eager young adventurers mistakingly thought the inn to be one of the finest in Arabel.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , Alanaerle provided food and lodgings for a small group of adventurers tasked by the city's Lady Lord Myrmeen Lhal with the investigation into a series of wizard murders. At the time, the customers of the inn whispered that the Royal Magician of Cormyr Vangerdahast was responsible for the murders, while others blamed the High Hand of the Lady Daramos Lauthyr , thinking him to be a petty man. Neither of the rumors was anywhere close to the truth.</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Alanaerle and her establishment remained open and popular. Volothamp Geddarm listed the inn in his Guide to Cormyr and complemented the establishments for its welcoming atmosphere and its eccentric innkeeper.</p>
