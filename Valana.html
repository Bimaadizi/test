Taking inspiration from the demonic rituals and blood sacrifices of the drow, she devised a particular enchantment that would allow someone to weaken the Rift Between Worlds using a small sacrifice of vitality, preventing it from destroying the world of Eberron . This mission also pitted the heroes against the draegloth Khaszlokhar , who guarded one of the Orbs of Lolth . While it took some effort for her to explain the details, the attack went off as planned, saving Eberron and weakening Lolth's hold on the Thread of the Weave .</p>
