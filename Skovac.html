<p>One day, the red dragon Scorlworyx attacked the Circle and killed most of the members bar Skovac. He sealed himself inside the temple with the relic. In time, he became a wight.</p>
<p>In 1489 DR, the reformed Cult of the Dragon agents Tibeem and Spernik discovered the whole story of Skovac. In order to gain the alliance of Scorlworyx, Spernik and a host of kobolds reached the temple. However, an adventuring party hired to capture Spernik also found the location. In the temple, the adventurers killed Skovac.</p>
