<p>Jub was a half-drow half-orc fisherman in Skullport .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jub was originally a slave saved from his slavers by Elkantar Iluim and his men. Out of gratitude he sometimes acted as a spy for Qilu√© Veladorn .</p>
<p>Around the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR , Jub was almost completely melted down by the dracolich Daurgothoth while spying on the Selvetargtlin 's attack on the Promenade of the Dark Maiden . In the Year of the Lost Keep, 1379 DR , it appeared that Leliana Vrinn managed to resurrect him to full health.</p>
<p>Later in 1379 DR, Jub was fishing with his companions when he happened to meet Leliana again as she was investigating a wizard's construct .</p>
<p>During the attack by Ghaunadaur 's followers on the Promenade, Jub was casually there and was put inside the Pit together with Naxil by the priests that were trying to awaken the avatar of their god.</p>
