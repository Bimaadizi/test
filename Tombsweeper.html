<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before 1281 DR , Tombsweeper belonged to a humorous fighter named Seldon Mirai , who felt no fear in the face of the undead. He was known to carelessly stroll into undead-infested tombs, making jokes and smashing shambling dead with the Tombsweeper . Eventually, his attitude towards necromancers ' creations attracted the ire of a powerful lich called Tiron . The irked lich placed a paralyzing curse on the warrior and ordering his skeletons to clobber him to death. Later, Tiron, ironically, raised Seldon Mirai as one of his mindless servants.</p>
<p>By 1281 DR , Tombsweeper ended up in the possession of the blacksmith Conlan in Kuldahar .</p>
