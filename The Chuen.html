<p>The Chuen were a small, traditionalist Shou society based in the Xiousing district of Marsember . Their name literally meant "The Pure".</p>
<h2>Beliefs</h2>
<p>The Chuen's beliefs bordered on xenophobia and members had a strong dislike of non-Shou. Members ran Shou-only businesses and harassed native Marsembans who visited Xiousing. The Chuen wrongly believed Duc-Sum Li established Xiousing to bring about Shou dominance of Cormyr .</p>
