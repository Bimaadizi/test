<p>Klauthen Vale was an area of land claimed by Klauth , a red dragon , in the Spine of the World in northwest Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Found lying among the mountains west of Mirabar and east of Raven Rock , the valley was a narrow and winding chasm.</p>
<p>The vale was protected from the cold climate of the North thanks to ancient and powerful magics, which changed its climate to remain always warm despite the season.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>"Old Snarl" filled the valley with sheep, goats, and rothé for eating. The mountains around the valley contained numerous caves, two of them large enough for Klauth to use as his lairs. He kept his legendary hoard in one of those caves, which could be entered only by lifting or pushing aside its door, a massive slab of stone.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Klauth made the valley his home after he almost died in a crash there on the fourth of Mirtul in 1360 DR . He had been wounded after a battle with three other dragons. He remained in hiding within the valley to gather his strength and made it his new lair.</p>
