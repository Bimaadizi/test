<p>Lacy Dancer was an elven agent of the Zhentarim in the city of Baldur's Gate in the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lacy was a wood elven woman with a bark-woody green-brown skin tone, long chestnut hair, and brown eyes. She wore leather armor dyed Zhentarim-green. She was a rogue armed with a short sword who had a knack for poetry.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Lacy Dancer worked under ranking Zhents Roah Moonglow and Friol , forging sticky alliances with the Guild and the Cult of the Absolute alike. The Guild began suffering losses at the hands of the Stone Lord , so Nine-Fingers Keene rolled dice and hired Zhentarim agents as muscle. Lugarrio was among the Zhents stationed within the Guild's Guildhall in the city's Undercellar . Nine-Fingers, however, did not know that Roah and Friol planned a betrayal. Taking out the Guild meant establishing a Zhentish presence in Baldur's Gate. With the city shuddering under the cult's attack, the struggle's outcome and Lugarrio's fate remained unconfirmed.</p>
