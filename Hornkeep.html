<p>Hornkeep , or the Dragonrider's Tower , was the keep of the mage Undarl in northwest Faerûn during the early-to-mid 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>When headed for Hastarl , Undarl's dragon went southeast over the Horn Hills , strongly implying it was northwest of Hastarl, across and close to the Horn Hills.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Undarl did breeding experiments in one chamber at the top of the tower, and had his apprentices engage in numerous tasks throughout the structure. Some of his experiments, however, were carried out at Undarl's tower instead, which was a separate location.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Undarl was known to have arrangements made in one balcony to cast a sleep of ages spell, presumably akin to Phezult's sleep of ages , identical among other aspects in that it consumed gemstones over time. He also had the dragon Anglathammaroth at his beck and call there.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The tower held Undarl's apprentices, including Hathan .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In or after Eleasias of the Year of the Chosen, 240 DR , the mage Undarl cast a sleep of ages that would last over a thousand years on his tower when he was called by Ithboltar in anticipation of the siege of Athalgard by the forces of Prince Elminster Aumar . The duration of over a thousand years on the enchantment meant it would not run its course until at least the Year of the Bright Sun, 1240 DR .</p>
