<p>Sespechian was a language spoken by the inhabitants of Sespech and the Shining Plains .</p>
<h2>Speakers</h2>
<p>Sespechian was spoken from Nathlekh in the north to Nagarr in the south and from the Snowflake Mountains in the west to Elbulder in the east.</p>
<p>While not spoken over a large region, the language was subdivided into a variety of dialects, including Hlondethan creole , Middle (or Proper ) Sespechian , Plains Sespechian , and Western (or " Lizard ") creole . Hlondethan creole was a mixture of Proper Sespechian with the language of the yuan-ti of Hlondeth , Western creole was mixed with the tongue of the lizardfolk of Surkh , and Plains Sespechian was strongly influenced by the wemics of the Shining Plains. All of these dialects were distinct enough to make intercommunication difficult, because of both accent and vocabulary.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sespechian was an Akalaic language in the Chessan languages group, just like Shaaran and Tashalan .</p>
