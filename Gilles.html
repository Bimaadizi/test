<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>During the time the Wailing Death plagued Neverwinter in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Gilles frequented the Moonstone Mask in the City Core. He was searching for someone with no conscience to work for him against the Church of Tyr. While Oleff Uskar of the Hall of Justice tried to recruit adventurers to find the tomb and ancient artifacts of the founder of Neverwinter, Halueth Never , to strengthen Neverwintran morale and maybe, just maybe, cure the plague, Gilles hoped to convince them to bring the artifacts to him for a hefty reward. Gilles planned on using them to benefit the Church of Talona and possibly, wrap the artifacts to the evil deity's will. Gilles also visited the dig site in the Peninsula District a stone a fanciful quill from the priests who ran the excavations. The priest's name was Jacob and he was already dead by the time Gilles got to roll the body over.</p>
