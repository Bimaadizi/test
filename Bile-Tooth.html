<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR, the Red Fang Marauders targeted the environs of Baldur's Gate , striking at traveling caravans from a base that was well hidden and one of its lairs in the caverns of the Trollbark Forest. Bile-Tooth commanded the goblin raiders to attack Randalla Brasshorn 's caravan that moved from Waterdeep to the Gate, capturing and dragging several caravaners, including Randalla, to the cavern depth, where the goblin leader and his beloved giant spiders guarded looted goods. Subsequently, a group of six heroes slew Bile-Tooth, his giant riding spider, and the marauders within the lair.</p>
