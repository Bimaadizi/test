<p>A hakeashar was a type of nishruu , similar to them in many ways.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They were a subspecies of nishruu and found in the Old Empires of Mulhorand , Unther , and Chessenta . They were identical with nishruus in almost every way except for their appearance.</p>
<p>Hakeashars had hundreds of grasping claws, piercing eyes and outstretched fanged mouths among the globular blood-red mist. Thus, hakeashars had a more horrific appearance and thus naturally could fill their foes with horror.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Hakeashars were slightly more powerful than their nishruu cousins: they had more powerful attacks, higher health, and immunity to standard weapons. Thus, it required a more powerful mage to summon one.</p>
