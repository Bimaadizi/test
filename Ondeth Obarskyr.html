<p>Ondeth Obarskyr was responsible for creating the settlement in the area known as the Forest Country that would later become known as Suzail , the capital of the nation of Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Relatives</h2>
<p>Ondeth's first wife was Suzara Obarskyr , with whom he had two sons, Rhiiman and Faerlthann Obarskyr . . After she left him, and dissolved their marriage, he married Minda Bleth , sister of Mondar Bleth . He had an older brother ( Andar ) who was killed in a boar hunt in Impiltur, And a younger brother, Villiam Obarskyr</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In 6 DR , Ondeth moved from Impiltur with his wife, brother and sons to a glen in the wolf woods (the future site of Suzail ) where they sought to create a new life. After four months, Baerauble Etharr introduced himself and Ondeth asked to be shown the elves living in the forest. Baerauble took Ondeth to an elven hunt in which Ondeth was able to participate, which was to prove an important first meeting.</p>
<p>After Suzara left in 12 DR , taking Rhiiman with her, Ondeth began seeing Minda Bleth , the sister of another settler to come to the new settlement, Mondar Bleth . It was this relationship that saved Minda's life in 16 DR , because she had been in bed with Ondeth instead of at home when the elves attacked and killed most of the other members of her family, but this also led to the discovery of their relationship. They would later marry, and Faerlthann's disapproval would turn into partial acceptance. By this time, a distance had grown in Ondeth's relationship with Baerauble, who was spending more and more time with Faerlthann.</p>
<p>Baerauble conveyed to Ondeth the elves' offering of the position of king of Cormyr after the massacre of the Bleths, but he turned it down, refusing to take a crown "born out of a massacre." Ondeth died in 26 DR at age sixty, his son Faerlthann creating the kingdom a day later.</p>
