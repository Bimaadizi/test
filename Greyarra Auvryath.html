The group stayed at their fortified camp , but the surface elves were uncooperative and refused to join in on their quest. Frustrated by this, Kelgoth went into the ruins on his own, followed by Zelliira and Uhlsdrin Nirveth as they searched for the Key to the Mythal . Greyarra was a touch worried about her friend heading to the House of Song , and so sent a team of adventurers to find her. Fortunately for them, Zelliira was safe and well, and the Icon of the Humans was found.</p>
