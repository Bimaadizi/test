<p>The Whitburns were among several wealthy patriar families that composed the nobility of Baldur's Gate , based out of the Whitburn Estate in the Temples District , just west of the Lionsmoot and southwest of the Citadel Gate .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR , the Whitburn family controlled a profitable slate quarry, located just east of Baldur's Gate.</p>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the city of Baldur's Gate was threatened by the encroaching army of the Cult of the Absolute , flooding it with refugees from across the Western Heartlands . During that tumult, Pammella Nortale of Nortale's Hostel called in an old off-hand promise made by Lord "Whit" Whitburn that he would make a donation to support the refugee hostel were he to come into money. Since the promise, Lord Whitburn had married a wealthy noble, so Pammella hoped to remind the patriar about the old promise via a letter. However, instead of money, Lord Whitburn only donated twenty-three pairs of male shoes.</p>
<p>The same year, Madeline Whitburn made a purchase at Bonecloak's Apothecary in the Lower City through her butler, Blathers . They purchased Rigid-Quik Cordial to aid Lord Whitburn's problem of "stiffness", but Lady Whitburn dispensed double the recommended dose mixed in with a glass of sherry to absolutely no effect. Madeline mailed a complaint letter to the proprietors of Bonecloak's Apothecary demanding money back or an alternative potion to aid Lord Whitburn.</p>
