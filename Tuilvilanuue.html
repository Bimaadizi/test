<p>Tuilvilanuue was a language spoken by raptorans that was derived from Elven .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tuilvilanuue was fluid and lyrical in sound, and though it contained many lengthy and tongue-twisting words, its grammar was simple, or at least simpler than Elven. It instead depended on inflection to convey a good deal of meaning. Thus, a spoken conversation in Tuilvilanuue was very clear and efficient, but with subtle aspects of intonation that were difficult for non-raptorans to fully understand.</p>
<h2>Script</h2>
<p>As Tuilvilanuue was derived from Elven it used the Espruar alphabet for written communication. However, due to the strong emphasis on inflection, the meaning of a text tended to lack the clarity of spoken Tuilvilanuue. This led raptoran authors to write several sentences to express the nuances of a passage. As a result, written works by raptorans were often rather long, with things often explained three or four times.</p>
<p>In any case, few Tuilvilanuue writings were made for the simple reason that raptorans found books to be heavy and difficult to carry when flying. Being practically minded, they reserved their writing for simple messages and preferred to memorize their poems, songs, and oral histories. This led to the creation of the raptoran saying, "Memories are lighter to carry than books."</p>
