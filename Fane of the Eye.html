<p>The Fane of the Eye was a large cavern complex deep under the Dessarin Valley . It was centered around a black ziggurat temple built by renegade drow and dedicated to the Elder Elemental Eye . Many prisoners were kept here, including Balix .</p>
<p>The cult that built it eventually died out or were hunted by drow loyal to Lolth . The complex remained abandoned until Vizeran De Vir found it and used it to forge the weapons Ironfang , Drown , Tinderstrike , and Windvane . He left the weapons there until the Fane of the Eye was found in 1491 DR by the latest incarnation of the Cult of Elemental Evil .</p>
