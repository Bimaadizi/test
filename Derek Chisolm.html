<p>Derek Chisolm was a baker at the family-run Downunda Patisserie in Ravens Bluff in the Vast in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was the son of Jemima and Arvend Chisolm , and the elder brother of Allison and Karl .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Since settling in Ravens Bluff, Derek tried to be the man of the house and felt responsible for his family. He didn't mind this, though, as it gave him purpose and he was dedicated to his mother, sister, and little brother. He spoiled Karl and protected Allison, usually by keeping away young men who might be interested in her, believing none were ever good enough. Like his mother, he would not speak about his father. He was happy with his lot and had no plans of leaving or becoming an adventurer like he knew his mother feared. While he'd had no chance to get formal schooling, his experiences made him wiser than others his age.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>At age 19, Derek stood 6 feet and 4 inches (1.9 meters) and weighed 197 pounds (89.4 kilograms). He had jet-black hair and eyes that matched his mother's bright blue. His mother rationed him and his siblings to only three of the bakery's smaller cakes a week to prevent them putting on weight.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He lived above the store. Derek was kept busy helping his mother in the bakery by putting out and selling goods and working second shifts at the ovens, and running the store when Jemima was busy. Only he and Jemima knew the key to the storage room's glyph of warding .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When his father Arvend was executed for murder and all the family's belongings seized, leaving them destitute and ashamed, Derek left with his family to build a new life. They arrived in Ravens Bluff and purchased the bakery. He was still working there by 1370 DR .</p>
