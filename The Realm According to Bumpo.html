<p>The Realm According to Bumpo was a mass-printed chapbook that told of adventures of a fictional character named Gabbin Bumpo, released before 1492 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like other chapbooks in Faerûn , The Realm According to Bumpo was a soft-cover book .</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>The chapbook's protagonist was a simple country bumpkin Gabbin Bumpo who recorded his travels across the Realms. One passage of note talked abut Bumpo's first meeting with more exotic humanoid species of Faerûn. Aarakocra were strange to him and he found it hard not to stare at the strange parrot-headed man. Along with the bird-folk traveled a tabaxi , or cat -folk, a genasi , or element folk, and even a tortle – a turtle folk. Bumpo asked the strange gang what they were, but the quarry remained unanswered. The rube concluded that he must've appeared as nothing more but one of a million boring humans to them.</p>
