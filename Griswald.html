<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the winter of Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Sir Griswald met a kind and enigmatic young woman who had recently arrived in the city of Baldur's Gate. The lady called herself Princess Soliana from the distant land of Fanloc. In reality, Soliana was a naive and romantic young woman, not a princess but the adopted daughter of the Green Hag of Lizard Marsh . Searching for a grand fairytale romance, Soliana created a story for herself and of her distant wealth and nobility. Several nobles quickly found themselves fascinated with the "princess" competing for her hand in marriage. Two main competitors were Sir Griswald, a noble and honorable knight, and conniving Feldran Exeltis, who lusted after the woman's wealth. Young Exeltis tricked Griswald into venturing away from the Gate and quickly swept in and convinced the gullible young woman that Sir Griswald abandoned Soliana, leaving for the Moonshae Isles for good. Feldran lured Soliana to his family's holding â€“ Castle Exeltis on the Blade Cliffs outside the city of Daggerford , where she became unknowingly imprisoned. When Sir Griswald discovered his beloved gone, he assembled his family's mercenaries and laid siege on Castle Exeltis but could not cross the cliffside moat. Lord Exeltis informed Griswald that Soliana loved him not and did not wish to see him. The honorable knight refused to believe the outrageous lie and demanded "princess" to tell it to his face. Desperate for help and growing overwhelmed with despair, Griswald sent his page to fetch a hero was recently gifted holdings in the town of Liam's Hold .</p>
<p>Soliana fell in love with Griswald in the spring of Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , but with his perceived abandonment, she gave into young Exeltis' affections. Soliana did not realize she was in captivity as she trusted Feldran because of his wealth, education, and promise to teach her to be truly noble, like in the fairytales her mother told her. When Sir Griswald started the siege, Feldran Exeltis announced that a monstrous barbarian horde was outside the castle moat and locked the "princess" in her tower "for her own safety."</p>
<p>Sir Griswald implored the Hero of Daggerford to sneak into the impregnable castle and lower the drawbridge, allowing the Griswald Knights to storm the stronghold. Even though it was unknown if the Hero was successful, some stories claimed that he managed to sneak inside the castle through old sewer cavers underneath the cliffside castle. If that were true, Sir Griswald was sure to have had confronted the Exeltis lordling putting an end to his life, and reuniting with his beloved.</p>
