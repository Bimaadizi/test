<p>Adamor Thellik was a Constal of the Purple Dragons of Cormyr , who was stationed in the town of Eveningstar and commanded the defense of the town during the invasion from Sschindylryn in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Adamor Thellik was a muscular human man adorned in a Constal's uniform – chainmail , gauntlets , and plate boots decorated with the Purple Dragons' insignia. He wielded a sword in battle.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 15 th century DR, a band of adventurers from the world of Eberron got involved in a grand scheme by the demonic Spinner of Shadows , who tore open a Rift Between Worlds that connected Eberron to the Demonweb Pits . After exploring the strange and horrific plane, they ended up in the Underdark of Faerûn , eventually emerging from the cavern near Eveningstar. After wandering into town they met Constal Thellik, who was quite bemused at these foreigners who did not know a single thing about Cormyr, Faerûn, or anything else. However, with the desperate war situation and the vouching of Elminster , he was willing to bypass the typical legal requirements of armed adventurers— peace-strings , charters, and so on—and simply induct them as auxiliary Purple Dragons, sworn to protect the kingdom by all means.</p>
<p>First the Constal dispatched them to liberate a farm on the outskirts of the King's Forest after it was captured by the priestess of Lolth Vicala Szind and her Warleader Speitar Dun'Robar , reported by the ragged maid Maisby . Another fire put out by Adamor's adventurers was helping Barana Talmere put an end to a group of drow necromancers raising undead in the graveyard of Deep Glen , and lastly, he directed a rescue mission to an abandoned Temple of Mystra in the King's Forest to retrieve Ana Brabener , a villager who had been caught by drow raiders. The drow threat culminated in the Battle for Eveningstar in which Constal Thellik's heroes fought alongside Swordcaptain Garwyn Thane to defend Eveningstar against a renewed drow assault led by Draya Dun'Robar and her powerful bebilith Red Weaver .</p>
