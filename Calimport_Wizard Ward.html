<p>Wizard Ward was one of the seven central wards of the city of Calimport , the center of its magical activities.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This ward was full of minarets, most of them wizard 's towers. Many magical and colorful protective wards and permanent illusions surrounded nearly 400 villas in Wizard Ward, making this part of the city a strange one to see for many visitors. These magical wards were established by private wizards, each with its own special protections and conditions.</p>
<p>This ward of the city contained more than 1,000 buildings, and at least a third of those buildings were the homes of sages or wizards. Because the typical wizard was introverted and studious, this was one of the least busy wards in Calimport to pass through. The more extroverted enchanters and illusionists did like to show off their arcane talents, but they were in the minority.</p>
<p>Wizard Ward was bordered by Quill Ward in the north and by Maker's Ward in the east. To the south, most of its border was with Hook Ward , but it also bordered Affar and Bitait Drudachs of Ylar Sabban in Dock Ward .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The ruler of the ward was Sultan Eli yn Adran el Beza , who was also the Caleph Arcane of Calimport. He was notable for dressing in the manner of the Red Wizards of Thay , complete with bald head and tattoos. He was also the brother of Nur el Beza of Almraiven .</p>
<p>Sultan Eli required membership in the Guild Arcane for anyone wishing to live in this ward.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The amlakkar of Wizard Ward included wizards in their membership, at least two for every ten amlakkar were found among the officers. They utilized rods of absorption and other defensive magical tools to neutralize criminal activity that was magical in nature. Indeed, the presence of such mages in the watch of this ward meant that chaos of the arcane variety was rare in this district than in most others in the city.</p>
<h2>Sabbans</h2>
<p>Wizard Ward was divided into three sabbans with nine drudach s.</p>
<h3>Etarad Sabban</h3>
<p>Also known as "Novice Sabban" or "Apprentice Sabban", this was where the wizards of lesser power and prestige lived. It was the least magically active of the three sabbans in the ward, because mundane businesses were less likely to be damaged from a powerful mage duel here than in the other two sabbans . These simple businesses offered services catering to wizards, such as cooking, cleaning, preparation of material component , etc .</p>
<p>The mark for this sabban was a wand or slash with seven-pointed stars around the tip. It contained three drudachs : Mindemn Drudach, Esaaf Drudach, and Tamuh Drudach.</p>
<p>Pasha Daud el Vehmet controlled the spice trade in Wizard Ward and lived in a fancy three-story home in Mindemn Drudach.</p>
<h3>Najja Sabban</h3>
<p>"Najja" was the name of one of the most powerful wizard's of Calimport's past. This sabban was also known as the "Auret Sabban", after its most famous landmark. Here was where the most powerful spellcasters of Calimport resided and where the Guild Arcane was based.</p>
<p>All buildings in this upper-caste neighborhood were ornate and elaborate affairs, and the shapes and facades—and sometimes even the locations—of the buildings changed with the will of their owners.</p>
<p>The mark for this sabban was three wands or slashes, each with seven-pointed stars around the tip. It also contained three drudachs : Odan Drudach, Ziana Drudach, and Mayya Drudach.</p>
<h3>Tarshaj Sabban</h3>
<p>Also known as "Magi Sabban", this was the sabban where wizards of intermediate power and experience congregated and where may sages and their services could be found. Dull compared to its neighbor sabban in the west, much like Etarad Sabban, in truth, a plethora of magical items and even artifacts could be acquired here, if one knew where to look. An industry of magic item identification, creation, and sometimes destruction was in place here. Because of the amount of powerful items changing hands so frequently here, the sabban also maintained a larger number of amlakkar .</p>
<p>The mark for this sabban was two wands or slashes, each with seven-pointed stars around the tip. It too contained three drudachs : Sha'ati Drudach, Fer'a Drudach, and Salleb Drudach.</p>
