<p>Ebony was black mare that was kept in the Backlands region of the Western Heartlands during the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Ebony and five other horses, Bandy , Cardinal , Fowler , Hopper , and Star were kept together by a traveling company that comprised the mage Druhallen , the guardswoman Rozt'a , and her foster son Tiep . When the group traveled through the Greypeak Mountains that year, the guardswoman Rozt'a rode atop Ebony and the other horses were forced to carry the men or their belongings.</p>
<p>Ebony almost fell one of the peaks' sheer sides as they traversed the treacherous pathways cut along its façade. Tumbling rocks startled the mare, but her reins were collected by Tiep and her nerves were soothed by the young man. Ebony returned the favor by giving Tiep a ride later on when he was very unwell.</p>
<p>She was one of the horses that survived the group's journey through the mountains, and accompanied its human members into the Weathercote Wood .</p>
