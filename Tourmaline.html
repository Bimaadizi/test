<p>Tourmaline was a long-crystalled mineral that came in many colors and was considered a fancy stone .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tourmaline could be found in a wide variety of colors, the more common being pale shades of blue, brown, gold, green, pink, red, and silver pearl. White or colorless tourmaline was called waterstar . If multiple colors occurred in the same crystal, it was known as rainbow tourmaline and was priced in the higher precious stone range. Black tourmaline was called ravenar and was considered a gem stone . A typical monochromatic specimen had a base value of 100 gp. And a red or pink tourmaline was called a rubellite .</p>
<p>Tourmalines were considered sacred by followers of Deneir —appropriate for sacrifice, or to be consecrated for use, or recognized as boons or omens when found. The rainbow variety of tourmaline was sacred to followers of Mystra .</p>
<p>These stones were mined in the Ten Towns region in northwest Faerûn near the town of Termalaine .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>All tourmalines could absorb any spell cast upon it and immediately convert it into three lightning bolts that blasted outward in straight lines from the crystal facets in directions chosen by the caster. This act consumed the gem in the process.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Tourmaline was a common stone among the drow, a gem worn by drow of average station, albeit they used only those of blue and red color.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , the town of Termalaine in Icewind Dale was evacuated following an unnatural blizzard and an invading army of verbeegs . The town's famous mines were abandoned and Marcos Flass , an exiled Red Wizard of Thay , seized that opportunity, hoping to use the mine's tourmaline to redeem his good name. He managed to quickly develop and build a batch of tourmaline golems , when the Hero of Neverwinter found their way into the Flass's laboratory during their operation to free Termalaine from the invading force. The Red Wizard may have had loaned his golems to defend the town of Targos against Arctus , the Walking Winter, and an army of its followers.</p>
