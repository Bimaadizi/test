<p>Phantom stalkers were beings native to the Elemental Plane of Fire . They typically appeared on the Prime Material Plane only when summoned by high-level magic-users, serving as guardians.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In their raw elemental state, phantom stalkers manifested as slender columns of flame, with faint outlines suggesting limbs and a head—evoking the image of a gaunt fire elemental. When they appeared on the Prime Material Plane, their most frequent guise was that of a tall, muscular humanoid, over 7 feet (2.1 meters) in height, with a reddish hue and blazing eyes. Their faces resembled stretched human features, defined by a pointed chin and prominent forehead. If provoked, they shed their tangible form, taking on the appearance of a spectral blaze.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Once summoned, phantom stalkers protected their masters with unwavering loyalty, engaging in combat as bodyguards. However, wizards had to be exceedingly careful when giving instructions—phantom stalkers obeyed commands to the letter and often twisted vague orders, eager to find a loophole that allowed them to return to their fiery home.</p>
<p>This tendency was a troublesome trait inherited from their interactions with the efreet . Despite this quirk, phantom stalkers generally performed admirably as bodyguards.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Phantom stalkers possessed the ability to alter their form and were known to manifest in a variety of shapes. Phantom stalkers possessed the ability to polymorph and frequently assumed various shapes, though most of their chosen forms retained the fiery palette of reds, yellows, and oranges. Regardless of form, they retained their capacity for flight—an ability unaffected by their altered physical shape.</p>
<p>These entities were capable of flight, and their aerial mobility remained intact regardless of the form they took, though their maneuverability did vary depending on the chosen shape.</p>
<p>They were completely immune to fire-based harm, and magical fire actually restored their vitality over time. Cold-based effects, by contrast, were far more dangerous, inflicting significant damage.</p>
<p>The phantom stalker had the ability to lower its body temperature to approximately 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius), allowing it to handle or transport objects without setting them ablaze. It also possessed a formidable strength.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Phantom stalkers typically engaged foes using their razor-sharp claws, each capable of inflicting light wounds.</p>
<p>In moments of imminent defeat during battle, a phantom stalker could unleash its remaining life force in a final burst as a fireball , after which the stalker dissolved and perished. In desperate circumstances, some chose to detonate this fireball upon themselves, aiming to damage as many opponents as possible. However, this act of self-sacrifice was reserved strictly for last stands and was never carried out if it risked harming the summoner, unless that summoner bore direct responsibility for the phantom stalker's doom, such as sending it knowingly into a suicidal confrontation.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>On the Elemental Plane of Fire, phantom stalkers had no formal hierarchy or organization. In fact, they were frequently pushed around and dominated by more powerful entities such as fire elementals , efreet, and salamanders .</p>
<p>Phantom stalkers were conjured through a specialized variant of the invisible stalker spell . The incantation required a piece of coal intricately carved to resemble a flame; beyond that detail, the spell operated identically.</p>
<p>When summoned by a mage, a phantom stalker typically expressed gratitude for having escaped the hostile environment of its native plane and demonstrated a willingness to serve loyally. Yet, despite this relief, it also harbored a deep-seated resentment toward being forcibly conjured. This was an internal conflict shared by many dwellers of the Elemental Planes.</p>
<p>There was a singular directive embedded in the summoning of phantom stalkers: if their conjurer was slain, the stalkers immediately vanished. Then, after a delay of 1 to 4 hours, they returned with deadly intent, having precisely traced the killer's location via the Ethereal Plane . This tracking ability manifested only upon the death of their master and faded as soon as they located the individual responsible. Once the phantom stalker had located its summoner's killers, it returned to the Prime Material Plane, driven by a burning desire for retribution.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Phantom stalkers were also valued for the volatile liquid fire coursing through their bodies. When successfully harvested, this elemental essence was used in the forging of flame tongue swords, legendary weapons imbued with fiery power.</p>
