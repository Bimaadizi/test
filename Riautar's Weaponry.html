<p>Riautar's Weaponry was a weapons shop in the city of Waterdeep that was owned by Zarondar Riautar in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>

<h2>Services</h2>

<h2>Inhabitants</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The petrified harpy on the building's roof dated back to the War of Five Wizards , wherein a wizard teleported three harpies into the city from a distant place and soon after another of the five wizards petrified them. Two of the harpies plummeted to the ground, shattering and crushing their summoner, while the third survived and became the statue atop Riataur's Weaponry.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Riautar's Weaponry was among the more notable and recognizable shops in the Trades Ward. It was widely considered to be one of the best sources for arrows, bowstrings , and longbows in Waterdeep, while the shop advertised itself as being one of the best sources in all of the North . Their arrows and longbows were both admired and coveted by any archer who saw them.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Urban legends claimed that some mage within Waterdeep would occasionally free the harpy from her petrified state, sending her out to kill for him, then force her back into her customary stone state. Over the years no evidence towards this rumor ever surfaced.</p>
