<p>The Eastside was a comfortable inn found in the town of Termalaine during the late 14 th and 15 th centuries DR . It was owned and operated by the fisherman Clyde and for a time, his wife.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>While the inn comprised a single structure, its exterior appeared to be several buildings clustered together.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The inn offered some of the best accommodations in all of Icewind Dale . Patrons were tended to by the young girl Marta , who helped Clyde after the passing of his wife.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Termalaine fell victim to an unnatural blizzard that drove all of its residents out to seek shelter in the larger towns of Bryn Shander and Targos . At the time, the Eastside's tavernkeep was a human man of impeccably groomed mustache and facial hair. Despite evacuation, he stayed behind to ensure his establishment wouldn't get sacked by a gang of verbeeg led by Slabhead , who took over the town once it was emptied of its inhabitants. When the inn was broken into by monsters, the keeper hid in the cellar and stayed alive until the Hero of Neverwinter and their allies broke the occupation with spell and sword.</p>
