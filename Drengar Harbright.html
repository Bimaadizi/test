<p>Drengar Harbright was the proprietor of the High Flagon gambling hall and inn located about two miles (just over three kilometers) north of Waterdeep on the Long Road , circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Drengar was one of the older uncles in the Harbright family of Waterdeep and, like most elder members of his family, was going gray at the temples. He was of average height and slightly on the slender side, with sharp, handsome features.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>As an employer, he was tough but fair to his employees and was respected and well regarded. To his family, he wanted to ensure that his daughters did not get pulled into the corruption of Waterdeep and hastily marry questionable suitors at a young age. Considering that the High Flagon regularly saw gambling, drinking, brawling, prostitution , and drug dealing, the move out of the city might have been in vain.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Under his management, the High Flagon rapidly became a bigger source of revenue for the Harbright family than their long-established textile business. He provided a relatively safe environment with many armed guards where privacy was respected, cheaters were not tolerated, and the drink menu was considerably long. He contributed to the excitement by occasionally "sweetening the winner's pot" with coins from the house coffers. By every measure, the Flagon was a successful business.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Drengar kept the keys to the money vaults (hollow spaces in the walls of the cellar accessible by well hidden, locked doors) in a drawer-safe concealed under a loose board near the wall of his private chamber.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The High Flagon was so successful that the Harbright family (under Drengar's supervision) opened another gambling den outside Waterdeep called the Roaring Dragon House .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>His daughters and sometimes other Harbright women worked in the kitchens of the High Flagon where he could keep an eye on them. Drengar placed his niece Brarindra and nephew Thoalur in charge of the Roaring Dragon where they took alternating shifts as manager.</p>
