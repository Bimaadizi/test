<p>The Avante Guard was an adventuring company based in the small city of Eylea somewhere in Faer√ªn in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1338 DR , the young wizard and would-be adventurer "Black" Dugal Buchannan went to Eylea to join the Avante Guard, but they declined him for his lack of experience.</p>
<p>After the Avante Guard destroyed a temple used by an obscure cult circa 1340 DR , the cultists sent their minions and hired mercenaries, including ogres , trolls , drow , and even demons , against Eylea. The attack raged for two days before it was routed, leaving many dead.</p>
