<p>As was common among many taverns, the Friendly Bat offered rooms for rent and ale to its patrons.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time during or before the 1490s DR, the village of Womford was taken over by the bandit gang known as the Pale Claw . The bandits stole all the wealth from the village's people. To help his family and his fellow townspeople, Grunnald joined the bandits, with the aim of redirecting their efforts to targets outside the town. Unfortunately, this left Mae and Muren to run the Friendly Bat on their own. In any case, the gang's influence over town left the tavern empty much of the time.</p>
<p>Some time after Grunnald's disappearance, group of adventurers led by Edgin Darvis ran the Pale Claw out of Womford for good. They reunited the reluctant "Bandit King" with his family; the reconciliation was a rather complicated affair.</p>
