<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , a pair of gloves of steadiness was worn by one of the orogs who were tasked with prying open the Seal of Mythanthor , a magical portal that connected the Halls of Light of Myth Drannor with Speculum Grounds in the City Heights. The orogs were confronted by a band of adventurers known as the Veiled Ones and the pair of gloves of steadiness changed hands.</p>
