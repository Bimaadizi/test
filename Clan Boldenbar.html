<p>Clan Boldenbar was one of the two shield dwarf clans in the Vast chiefly responsible for the construction of the city of Sarbreen , part of the larger kingdom of Roldilar , and the rulers of it in all but name.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>An heirloom of this clan that was passed down through the generations, a Hammer of Thunderbolts , was the source of Sarbreen's alias, "City of the Hammer". When the kingdom of Roldilar fell, Unteius led the city's refugees to safety. While traveling through the Underdark , his Hammer of thunderbolts was lost somewhere during an ambush, though the events of that day went unrecorded.</p>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR , Clan Boldenbar was making efforts to reestablish its presence and authority within the Vast, reopening many of its old clan halls.</p>
