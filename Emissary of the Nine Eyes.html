<p>The Emissary of the Nine Eyes was an enigmatic being that appeared within the Astral Plane .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Emissary appeared as a 'person' with markings upon their body that looked like eyes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some unknown time, the Emissary of the Nine Eyes appeared before the 'spiritual echoes' of four dragonborn elders of the Inquest , as they remained trapped within the Astral Plane. The Emissary showed to them an unknown 'Viridan Planet' upon which the dragonborn of Abeir could resettle, and live free from the war of xorvintaal .</p>
<p>This meeting inspired the Inquest to begin construction on the bridge of stars , a world-spanning device that would never reach completion.</p>
