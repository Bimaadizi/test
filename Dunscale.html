<p>Dunscales , or dunscale lizards , were a type of reptile native to the Shaar .</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Dunscales spent most of their time sunbathing lazily. However, they were capable of sudden great speed, making them fast enough to catch their prey. They were even quicker to devour any food that did not require them to chase it.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Dunscales hunted insects , rats , and small lizards . They were omnivores, and were also known to eat trash and even dung.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the settlement of Rethmar first grew to a thousand people, rats arrived in great number with the caravans that passed through the city on the Trader's Way . This rat population was brought under control largely thanks to predation by the local dunscales, who had driven the rodents nearly extinct by the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . The inhabitants of the city began to feed the lizards their waste and spoiled food, leading them to use the expression "tossed to the dunscales" meaning to throw something away.</p>
