<p>The House Fajirik Military Camp was a relatively permanent outpost of House Fajirik , located west of the Jamal Oasis in the High Desert of Zakhara .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Soldiers stationed here were often bored, which many traders took advantage of by bringing goods and services for them to spend their money on. Captain Ramad bin Yusif al-Kahn kept men on watch constantly along the southern border of a barren weed field called a qara'a . During peacetime, these soldiers had nothing to do except stare out into the vast emptiness of the desert and wait for any movement from the soldiers of House Ashurim , which was located on the other side of the qara'a . This waiting game had lasted up to 200 years by 1367 DR .</p>
<p>Funding for these soldiers was rumored to come from Tajar for House Fajirik, and Qudra for House Ashurim.</p>
