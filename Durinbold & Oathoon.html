<p>Durinbold & Oathoon was a shop that supplied provisions to businesses of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , during the Absolute crisis , Durinbold & Oathoon faced supply chain difficulties due to caravans not being able to freely enter the city. Martnev Oathoon, Valued Customer Disciplinarian, sent out a notification letter to Oliver Tefoco of The Bee Hive in the Lower City , informing him of the suspension of food and dry goods deliveries that would eventually renew when the crisis ended. During the same year, Pammella Nortale of Nortale's Hostel , was in debt to Durinbold & Oathoon and missed a month's payment. The provisioners demanded her to make a minimum payment or be tuned over to the Fist Repossessions .</p>
