<p>Basidironds ( pronounced : / b ɑː ˈ s ɪ d ɪ r ʌ n d / ba-SID-i-rund ) were a type of fungus creature that could be dangerous to adventurers .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Unlike some fungi, basidirons had multiple stems. Their bodies had a woody, leathery texture that was dark orange in hue. They had inverted cup-like caps with a sooty black interiors. Some described their stems as being somewhat insect-like in appearance. They typically stood 7 ft (2.1 m) tall and weighed around 350 lb (160 kg).</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>Basidironds had two types of spores. The first would clog a victim's respiratory tract. The second type were only released when they were stationary, forming an invisible cloud around the fungus in a 20​ to ​35 feet (6.1​ to ​11 meters) radius, and had a hallucinatory effect.</p>
<p>Following the Time of Troubles , the first type of spore was said to be emitted as a very dark cloud that rose out from their cup-like caps;. The secondary type was said to be constantly emitting and their clouds had grown to cover a 60 feet (18 meters) radius.</p>
<p>Some of these hallucinations were environmental, making victims believe they were in a swamp and needed to remove their armor to prevent sinking or that they were in quicksand . Sometimes victims believed that they were surrounded by spiders , scorpions , or various other types of vermin. Sometimes a victim believed that objects around them had been transformed into snakes or that an item they were wearing was a ravenous leech .</p>
<p>Other times these hallucinations were more focused on the self, believing one had shrunk or that their body was melting. Finally, some afflicted by these spores were known to hallucinate that their associates were carrying a contagious disease or that they were bleeding to death. Regardless which type of spore was being experienced, they could be eliminated by spell or magical effects that removed diseases .</p>
<h2>Ability</h2>
<p>Being a fungus, basidironds had no intellect for mind-affecting spells to work on, such as charm monster and hold monster . They also possessed a partial immunity to severe cold temperatures and cold-based spells, though their movement was still quite impaired by them.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>These fungi remained motionless unless a creature attacked or came too close within their reach. When engaging a creature in combat, basidironds would lash out with their cone-shaped cap, slamming them into the attacking creature, unleashing their deadly suffocating spores.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Some claimed that there existed basidironds of white or pale yellow hues in the Underdark that were the size of ogres .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Basidironds fed upon organic rot and decaying matter, drawing nutrients up through from their victims' bodies through their many stalks.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Basidironds were typically found above ground in moist, temperate forests that were very unkempt and had heavy canopies that routinely blocked out most of the suns rays. Some were known to dwell in swamps or underground locations. In the Underdark they were particularly known to be found in some parts of Deepearth .</p>
<p>Besides the Prime Material plane , basidironds inhabited some parts of the Abyss . Especially those ruled over by the demon lord Zuggtmoy . In particular, her personal realm of Shedaklah , the Slime Pits, 222nd layer of the Abyss.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Like many types of fungi, basidironds were servants of Zuggtmoy.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>The final dish in the Final Feast ritual performed by Zuggtmoy cultists required bitter black syrup, derived from the sap of a basidirond.</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>The spores of these fungi were one of many that the cloak of symbiotic protection protected its wearer against.</p>
