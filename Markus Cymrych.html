<p>Markus Cymrych was High King of the Moonshae Isles in the early-to-mid 4 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was a member of the Cymrych Dynasty and the second son of a former High King, the infamous Gwylloch Cymrych , as well as the younger brother of the legendarily cruel Prince Ketheryll . He was the nephew of his predecessor, High King Gorham .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Markus was only eleven years old in the Year of the Vaasan Knot, 299 DR , when both his High King father and his older brother killed themselves and their retainers in a madness -induced melee at the Castle of Skulls . At that time, the crown passed to his father's younger brother, Gorham. Markus would assume the throne of the High King in the Year of Seven Scales, 322 DR , after killing Gorham.</p>
<p>He ruled for eleven years before he died in combat without an apparent heir in the Year of the Drawstring, 333 DR . The throne thus passed to a cousin, Cameron Cymrych , who was the grandson of Markus's great-grandfather .</p>
