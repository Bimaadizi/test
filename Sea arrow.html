<p>Sea arrows were arrows that were designed for underwater use by aquatic elves .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sea arrows were made by sea elves, specially made to exceptionally high quality. When used with an aquatic longbow the arrows flew (or swam) forth over a long distance without slowing down or losing accuracy as most other missile weapons did, giving the user a great advantage over their target.</p>
