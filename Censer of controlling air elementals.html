<p>Censers of controlling air elementals were enchanted incense burners that could pull creatures from the Elemental Plane of Air to the Prime Material plane .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These enchanted thuribles were made out of gold and covered with arcane scripts etched into the surface. These words translated to prayers to Akadi , the Queen of Air. A typical censer of controlling air elementals was 0 feet and 6 inches (0.15 meters) wide and 0 feet and 1 inch (0.025 meters) deep perforated bowl.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When fulled with incense and lit, such censer summoned an air elemental under the summoner's control. This ritual could be performed once per day. If magical incense of meditation was used with these thuribles, an elder air elemental was summoned. Each censer of controlling air elementals could only summon one creature at a time. The summoned air elemental could be dispelled with spells or dismissed by its summoner.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>A skilled crafter of wondrous items could create similar censers with the use of summon monster VI and summon monster IX spells.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1372 DR , several powerful magical items were brought to Toril by a planeswalking wizard Vejoni H. Wyzz who pitched his extraplanar tent just outside the town of Liam's Hold . Censers of controlling air elementals could be found in his collection.</p>
