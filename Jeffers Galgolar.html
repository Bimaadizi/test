<p>Jeffers Galgolar was a pawnbroker who ran Brothers Galgolar Pawnshop alongside his twin, Malachi Galgolar , in the Pumpside neighborhood of Ravens Bluff in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>At the age of forty-seven winters, Jeffers appeared to be in good shape for a human man. Like his twin brother, Jeffers had a head of brown hair, a thin and sharp chin, and muddy brown eyes.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Jeffers was a calm man who valued all things good and the rule of law. He was hard to anger and easy to forgive those who wronged him. He committed his life to the family pawnshop and would never cheat or offer unfavorable deals, unlike his twin. Because of his morals, Jeffers would never knowingly deal with thieves trying to pawn stolen goods. Whilst running the shop, Jeffers often happily whistled elaborate melodies or quoted poetry.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Jeffers was a fighter of mild experience. He wielded daggers and a long sword . He also possessed an artist's talent and was a skilled appraiser. He was fluent in the Common tongue , Dwarvish , and Thorass .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Jeffers always wore his enchanted ring of delusion , believing it to be a ring of truth . The ring was a gift from his unsavory brother to cheat the man into accepting goods from similarly unsavory elements of the Bluff.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jeffers and his twin brother, Malachi, hailed from an old Ravenaar family that had been running a pawnshop and moneylending business almost since the founding of the city. In his youth, Jeffers spent a bit of time adventuring on behalf of the family business, performing deliveries and guarding shipments all across Faer√ªn and even to the City of Splendors, Waterdeep . Eventually, the brothers became the last in a line of Galgolars who ran the business over the years. They took over the pawnbroker shop after their father's, Joseph Galgolar 's, death and were still fully committed to the job twenty years later.</p>
