<p>The fifth Baron of Bloodstone , known only by his family name Tranth , was the ruler of Bloodstone Pass and de facto mayor of Bloodstone Village in the early and mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tranth stood at 5 feet, 11 inches tall (180 cm). While strong in his youth, he had put on weight by the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, weighing around 200 pounds (91 kilograms). His hair had greyed by this time.</p>
<p>In battle, he preferred to fight heavily armored in plate mail . In melee, he preferred his enchanted shield and longsword , and at range, he used a mundane heavy crossbow .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Tranth was magnanimous and dedicated to the welfare of his people. He could be curt in conversation, but exuded competence and nobility.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Tranth was a member of House Tranth , the hereditary rulers of Bloodstone Valley. He had a daughter, Christine . He was a direct descendent of the first King of Damara, Feldrin Bloodfeathers , and was thus related to King Virdin Bloodfeathers .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tranth was born in autumn of the Year of the Singing Skull, 1297 DR , and inherited the barony from his father in the Year of the Striking Falcon, 1333 DR , not long before trouble in Vaasa began to reduce the appeal of Bloodstone Pass as a trade route.</p>
<p>Tranth led his people through the horrors of both the Wolf Winter of 1347 DR and the decade-long invasion of Damara by Zhengyi the Witch-King beginning the following year. During these periods, this barony's wealth evaporated with first the loss of trade and the subsequent loss of Bloodstone Mines , their primary source of mineral wealth. Following Damara's capitulation to Zhengyi in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Tranth was the only ruler of any Damaran barony or duchy not to be killed and replaced by a lackey of the Witch-King, although he effectively wielded no political power outside of Bloodstone Village itself.</p>
<p>After the fall of Damara, the Grandfather of Assassins built the local bandits into a powerful army, and Tranth agreed to pay tributes to the bandit army in order to spare the villagers' lives. However, when the bandits also took away as slaves some youths from the village, Tranth decided he needed to fight back. Thus, in 1358 DR , he sent Garlen and Garvin in search of some adventurers to help them.</p>
<p>After Gareth Dragonsbane 's party destroyed the bandit army, Tranth acquiesced to the request by his daughter, Christine, to marry Gareth. Tranth then stepped down, making Gareth the sixth Baron of Bloodstone. He served as an advisor to Gareth throughout the Bloodstone Wars , and was a key voice calling for Gareth and his accomplished companions to depart the battlefield in order to strike at both the Citadel of Assassins and Castle Perilous . He was present at the decisive battle at the Ford of Goliad .</p>
<p>Following the end of the Bloodstone Wars in 1359 DR , Tranth proposed the creation of a Bloodstone Kingdom , comprising both Vaasa and Damara .</p>
