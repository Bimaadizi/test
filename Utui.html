<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Utui had a communal herd of 1,500 caribou . The communal caribou herd was the only thing the families of Utui collaborated on, otherwise they did not associate with each other and fierce rivalries were common between two separate families. tupa was common, with the bride moving into the groom's minikitak, but the brides family mourned for several weeks as if they lost a loved one.</p>
<p>While rivalries existed, violence between families was rare. The rivalries between families manifested as a competition of sorts, each family attempting to craft the finest item. As a result, the village created some of the finest trade good in the Great Glacier. Clothing, jakerek , rissik and weapons from Utui were highly sought after.</p>
