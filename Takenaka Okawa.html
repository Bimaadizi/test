<p>Takenaka Okawa was the shikken of Kozakura in 1357 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Okawa became shikken in 1349 DR after the conclusion of the Hojo War , where the Takenaka clan gained supremacy over the Hojo clan , putting a puppet shogun on the throne. However, Takenaka Sugawara , the true military leader of the war, couldn't ascend to the shikken position because he was of no blood relation to the shogun , a trait possessed instead by his half-brother, Okawa.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Okawa was reserved and aloof, ambitious and very able in manipulate others. He was able in administrative works but not an inspired military leader or a good diplomat. Okawa considered Sugawara only a jealous man and was divided by the necessity to keep united his clan and frustration for Sugawara's actions against him</p>
