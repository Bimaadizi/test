<p>Yenward Chorster was a Cormyrean Purple Dragon officer who served in the town of Eveningstar in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar , Yenward recruited emergency reinforcements on the spot in the village. He sent them to the ruined keep in the King's Forest , which was a surprisingly vital spot for ritual casting. The reinforcements joined other Purple Dragons in protecting the Wizard of War Arganon Pine from bandits and werewolves , and protecting the Wizard of War Zenyff Bravehand from the murderous forces of nature. The recruits were naturally well-compensated with Cormyrean currency .</p>
