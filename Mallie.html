<p>Mallie was a young individual who served aboard the Marderward for a time during the midâ€”15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Mallie served under the malicious Captain Taraf Predeau . Captain Predeau pitted the young crew of the Marderward against one another, leading them to commit violence against other children.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time during or before the Year of Splendors Burning, 1469 DR , Mallie and several other young sailors aboard the Marderward shifted their allegiances from Predeau to a new crewman, Harp Levesque .</p>
<p>When Mallie saw the young boy Kitto being beaten to the point of near-death, they informed Harp immediately. Harp intervened and took Kitto's place as the target of Predeau's ire. Their actions helped save Kitto's life.</p>
<p>After that incident, Harp led Mallie and others in mutiny against Captain Predeau. Malli's job was to awaken the adult sailors they believed would fight on their side. The young crew successfully overthrew their abusive captain, and earned their freedom from the Marderward .</p>
