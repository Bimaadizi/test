<p>The Hand That Swings the Sword was a shrine to Tempus , Lord of Battles, situated in the city of Elturel in the Western Heartlands in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<p>Priests at the shrine sometimes directed visiting fellows with healing powers who needed coin to go to The Bent Helm tavern. They could work in the tavern's back room to patch up knife wounds during the constant brawls there. This was lucrative: the usual fee for a spell was a 1000 gp .</p>
