<p>The justiciars of Tyr were the mortal embodiment of justice and order on Toril , elite servants of the god Tyr who carried out his will across all the Realms.</p>
<h2>Activity</h2>
<p>A justiciar could be assigned to one or more of many duties in their life. In metropolitan areas they often served as judges or local magistrates to ensure justice is being carried out to the lawbreakers of a city. Out in the wild frontiers like the North they assisted with the founding of settlements, helping to maintain law and order in what are typically lawless lands.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Novice justiciars were taught combat techniques in order to fight those beings that exhibited chaotic behavior or anarchic outlook on the world. They learned how to see through the deceptions inherent in the words and deeds of others.</p>
<p>Throughout their studies, they learned a great deal about local laws, regulations, and bureaucratic processes related to the region they oversaw. This dedication to law empowered the justiciars, especially in regard to the power of their divine spellcasting .</p>
<p>Tyr himself granted a number of boons to his justiciars. Venerated justiciars were protected from spells and spell-like effects cast by beings that drew their power from the realms of chaos. They were empowered with the abilities to infuse their weapons with energy of law , and even emanate an aura that turned away the forces of mayhem .</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>Most justiciars began their careers as clerics and paladins in service to Tyr . A fair number of the senior Knights of Samular at Summit Hall followed the path of the justiciar.</p>
<p>Those members who strayed from the teachings of Tyr were stripped of their divine powers until they demonstrated proper atonement .</p>
