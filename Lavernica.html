<p>Lavernica was a naturalist and a groundskeeper of Bloomridge Park in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lavernica was described as a "lover of birds , bees , and everything in between." Judging by a historic log of the Emerald Enclave 's activities found in the groundskeeper's home, Lavernica was possibly affiliated with the druidic organization.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Lavernica was a busy groundskeeper who diligently cleaned fallen branches and blocked pathways off, polished stone benches, cleaned ponds, and unlocked the park gates every morning. The daily afternoon tasks included raking leaves, killing pests, repairing signage, and evening gate locking. Lavernica's journal had detailed notes on botany and plant care. It also noted that Lavernica witnessed some suspicious lurkers in the park and wanted to notify the Flaming Fist mercenaries. This was what ended the groundskeeper's life. Lavernica was targeted and surely murdered by the Bhaalist Murder Tribunal run by Orin the Red . The groundskeeper's home, just by the park's eastern gates, was bathed in violence; numerous pet giant spiders were killed inside, as well as duergar and drow , whose gore was turned into an unholy effigy dedicated to the Lord of Murder.</p>
