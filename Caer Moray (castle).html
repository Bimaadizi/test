<p>Caer Moray was a castle on the island of Moray in the Moonshae Isles . It overlooked the small city of Moray , sometimes also known as "Caer Moray" in honor of the castle. The castle was in ruins as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The castle lay on the northeastern side of the town. It sat atop a low hill with a rocky pinnacle standing above a rocky beach.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The main keep sat atop the pinnacle of rock above the beach, while the hilltop that controlled access to it was ringed by a stone curtain wall punctuated with five round towers and a variety of guard buildings. The walls in turn were surrounded by a moat, with a drawbridge allowing access to the 15‑foot-high (4.6‑meter) main gate. As of the late 15 th century DR, all of these structures were in ruins: the wall had toppled and the drawbridge was gone, and instead a causeway of rubble had been created to serve as a bridge.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The courtyard leading up to the keep was full of stone cisterns plus a well that could be used to access a sea cave beneath the ruined keep. Even after the fall of the castle, the multistory keep remained intact enough that the banquet hall and upper floors were mostly usable, and occasionally a storage room might be found that had remained remarkably pristine.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Naphthalene could be poured and ignited upon attackers from hidden cisterns within the old walls. When those walls still stood, the wooden main gate was the weakest point in the defenses.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of the Snow Winds, 1335 DR , the capital of Moray lacked a castle, a clear sign of how poor the Kingdom of Moray was at the time. It was the only Ffolk realm without such a fortress, and residents were forced to flee to defensive towers away from the coast if they came under attack from Northlander raiders. Caer Moray was constructed in the following decades, and had been completed by the time of the Spellplague in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , only to fall shortly afterward. It came under attack by lycanthropes of the Black Blood tribe , who tore down its walls.</p>
<p>The castle was subsequently reclaimed following the arrival on Moray of Lady Amaranth , a le Shay princess from Sarifal who came to lead a group of mostly female and good lycanthropes out of the ruins beginning in the late 1460s DR. Within a decade, they had largely rebuilt the defensive walls, and had adapted the keep's banquet chamber into a place where they could craft metal goods and textiles . They soon became a beacon of protection for the humans who had settled the northern coast of Moray in the years since the lycanthrope attacks, and were known to celebrate a version of the Feast of Stags in which they freely shared food during hard winter months.</p>
<p>These lycanthropes were seen as heretics by the Black Blood tribe, and when Malar was revived on Moray in the late 1470s DR, they launched an assault on the castle in the Battle of Caer Moray . They scaled the walls and battered down the gate, and it was only thanks to the intervention of Chauntea that the defenders were saved: the godess sent a massive wave to sweep away the attackers. However, it was also Chauntea's will that Lady Amaranth leave Moray, and so her wave also toppled the newly rebuilt walls, thus largely ending the community that had been established there. Amaranth departed, leaving the survivors in the hands of her adopted sisters, Lightfoot and Bay .</p>
