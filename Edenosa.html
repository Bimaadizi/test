<p>Edenosa was a rock gnome Manip of the Flaming Fist and a True Soul of the Cult of the Absolute in Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>While operating at the entrance of Bloomridge Park in the Lower City in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Manip Edenosa recognized a fellow True Soul and established a telepathic connection through their illithid tadpoles . Edenosa cautioned them about the presence of the Absolute 's warriors deeper within the park and advised against interfering with their activities. Later, the Absolute itself may have had spoken through the tadpole in Edenosa, causing her speech to be strained and fragmented. If that were to pass, after a few sentences, Edenosa would briefly regain her awareness before succumbing to death. The Absolutists within the park were members of the Cult of Bhaal , ready to commit a slaughter of the innocents.</p>
