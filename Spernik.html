<h2>History</h2>
<p>Spernik was a cultist cleric of Tiamat who had infiltrated Phlan for a long time. He stole a book from Mantor's Library in order to instigate a red dragon to attack the city. However, thanks to some adventurers, he was defeated in the end and arrested by the Knights of the Black Fist .</p>
<p>His trial became a long-running case, a fact that concerned Aleyd Burral . When his fellow cultists, led by Vorgansharax , launched a coup in the city in 1489 DR , Spernik was freed and became one of the top cultist leaders. Eventually, the Harpers , using Glevith as an intermediary, hired some adventurers in the city to capture or kill him, which they did after a fight.</p>
