<p>The roadwatch bow was an old magical longbow found in the ruins of Beckside Castle , a ruin in Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The bow was strongly axiomatic and aligned with law , giving it great power against chaotic beings. It also unerringly aimed for weak points and vitals in the target, making it exceptionally lethal. The enchantments on the longbow meant that it remained in perfect condition despite being lost for so long.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The roadwatch bow was once used by Purple Dragons that patrolled and watched over the High Road , only to be lost in the ruins of Beckside Castle when it was destroyed during the Goblin War of the last century. It was discovered again over a century later in the mid-1480s DR when Harper agents fought the Netherese arcanist Gaston Wyrst for a piece of the Abyssal Planus Mechanus Nether Scroll hidden there. At the time, the old bow was hidden inside the castle's remaining tower, which had recently served as a signal beacon until an umbral gargoyle laired there.</p>
