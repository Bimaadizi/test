<p>The Twisted Rune was a highly secretive cabal of liches and other powerful undead spellcasters based in the Lands of Intrigue .</p>
<h2>Membership</h2>
<p>The inner circle was highly secretive, and employed agents to do their bidding, most of whom were unaware that they worked for the Rune. The seven known Runemasters were Jymahna , Kartak Spellseer , Priamon "Frostrune" Rakesk , Rhangaun , Sapphiraktar the Blue , Shangalar the Black , and Shyressa . The eighth Runemaster was Jhaniloth Puiral .</p>
<p>The organization was originally a loose consortium of liches who each had their own networks of agents to do their bidding. This became unwieldy as the organization grew, so the hierarchy was tightened. By 1370 DR , the organization's top level was the senior Runemasters' Council, nine in number, and only those one or two ranks removed from this (around thirty in number around 1370 DR) would even have been aware they were working for the Twisted Rune.</p>
<p>As of 1370 DR, the organization had 100 agents in total. Twisted Rune agents often worked for other organizations in the south such as the Cowled Wizards or the Knights of the Shield .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Rune secretly controlled nearly half the powerful families of Calimshan . However they rarely acted directly to achieve their goals, instead preferring to let time work for them since they were, in effect, immortal.</p>
<h3>Gates</h3>
<p>After Highharvestide, 1369 DR, the Twisted Rune was able to construct two-way gates , magical portals , between their lairs across the Lands of Intrigue and a central meeting point, which could only be used by the undead .</p>
<h2>Bases of Operations</h2>
<p>In Amn , they had a safe-house in Athkatla 's Bridge District .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early History</h3>
<p>An elderly wizard of Calimshan by the name of Rysellan the Dark established the Twisted Rune in the Year of the Broken Branch, 864 DR . His aim was to form a covert consortium of mages who would be the power behind the thrones across the Lands of Intrigue. But they eventually fell into infighting, which would lead to Rysellan's destruction.</p>
<p>By 1018 DR , the Rune had become the most powerful organization in southwestern Faerûn , with agents in every country south of the High Moor and west of the Storm Horn Mountains . The Rune gained control of Mierittin , Valashar , and Tathtar , as well as some smaller realms, but their work was soon undone and they decided that shifting their focus to single cities and towns rather than whole nations was a better approach. The Rune became its own enemy to some extent, with members vying to wrest power and influence from one another.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Tomb, 1182 DR , Rysellan gained the trust of Wyvorlaa , the court wizard of Tethyr , and the Twisted Rune gained influence over Tethyrian politics as a result. However, the work of Rysellan and his closeness with Wyvorlaa caused jealously amongst the Rune's other members, and in the Year of the Soft Fogs, 1188 DR , three other liches accused Rysellan of divulging secrets. The ensuing battle destroyed Rysellan and two of his apprentices. This was also the end of the Twisted Rune's influence in Tethyr, as Wyvorlaa was uncovered and executed.</p>
<p>In the 1200s DR, Bhagenn the Crimson of Amn , a lich and member of the Rune at the time, was petitioned by a lich named Priamon "Frostrune" Rakesk , who wanted to join. Bhagenn had planned to use Priamon's membership to kill one of his rivals, but instead, Priamon allied with this rival to kill Bhagenn himself. Afterward, the remaining members chose replacement Runemasters for Rysellan and Bhagenn and thereafter were, relatively, cooperative in their plans.</p>
<h3>Modern History</h3>
<p>In the Year of the Fist, 1311 DR , a lich of the Twisted Rune cast Bigby's crushing hand on Zelphar Arunsun , causing his death, as a favor to the Shadow Thieves . The Shadow Thieves and the Twisted Rune maintained a bond after this.</p>
<p>The realm of Mulsparkh was set up by the Twisted Rune as part of their retaliation against the Paladin Prince Rythan of Tethyr for his murdering of Rune member Jhaniloth Puiral in the Year of the Marching Moon, 1330 DR .</p>
<h3>Halaster's Higharvestide</h3>
<p>At dawn on Highharvestide of the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , two members of the Twisted Rune managed to kidnap Halaster Blackcloak from inside Undermountain . Priamon and the alhoon Ralayan the Ocultacle used a ring of multiple wishes to bind and summon the Mad Mage in Stardock in the Tears of Selûne , where they intended to probe the great archmage 's mind for his intricate knowledge of portals and magical gates . Eventually, he managed to escape. Meanwhile, gates to Undermountain allowed monsters to venture forth across the Realms, keeping many major players busy getting rid of them. The Rune created gates between their lairs in the Lands of Intrigue and a central meeting point, and these gates were restricted to undead use only. Priamon was made a senior Runemaster for his work.</p>
<h3>Maztica</h3>
<p>The Rune disguised a wizard as a slave girl, who was subsequently purchased by Lord Drakosa of Manshaka . He took her to Maztica , thereby giving the Rune the beginning of an influence over the New World.</p>
<h3>Year of Lightning Storms</h3>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Priamon "Frostrune" Rakesk was fooled by Khelben "The Blackstaff" Arunsun , his former mentor but now hated adversary, into seeking what he thought to be an ancient Shoon artifact. With this artifact, he planned to take control of the Twisted Rune. Blackstaff then struck a deal with Sapphiraktar the Blue , with the Rune preferring to have the Blackstaff deal with the traitorous Runemaster rather than having to deal with him themselves. The Frostrune's immobilized body was teleported into Undermountain, where the Mad Mage, in possession of the lich 's phylactery, could take revenge on his former kidnapper.</p>
<h3>Post-Sundering</h3>
<p>Drawn by rumors of the discovery of Azuth 's Lost Spell in the Year of Dwarvenkind Reborn, 1488 DR , the Runemaster Calathlarra arrived at the home of Lord Sardasper Halaunt , where she was destroyed by the archmage Tabra .</p>
