<p>Demonshields were magical shields binding powerful fiends and using them to grant magical powers to their users.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Demonshields were magical shields forged from an alloy of silver with arjale and tantulhor , two rare ores found in the infernal layer of Phlegethos . This gave them a silvery appearance with a greenish hue, and caused them to be extremely resistant to physical attacks while retaining a level of flexibility. Having been created during the reign of the Shoon Imperium they were given the form of diamond shields , typical of that era.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The demonshields had the ability to grant their wielders powers borrowed from the fiends imprisoned within them during their creation. For example a demonshield containing a glabrezu would give its wielder unnatural resistances and immunity to some forms of elemental damage.</p>
<p>While a fiend was imprisoned within a demonshield, it was impossible to communicate with them. If a shield was destroyed however, the creature within was released and free to act as it pleased.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Year of the Addled Arcanist, 128 DR the wizard Halaster Blackcloak , then known as Hilather , was hired by the rulers of the Shoon Imperium. According to their agreement Halaster would provide the empire with a new way to bind fiends which was more secure than the methods used in this day and age, in exchange of which the wizard would receive some mysterious payment.</p>
<p>Halaster spent four years working on his task in the realm of Torsil , hidden in the catacombs of an abandoned tower. He emerged four years later, during the Year of Thirteen Prides Lost, 132 DR , with thirteen magical shields and Hilather's Workbook —a libram describing their creation.</p>
<p>Twelve of the shields were distributed amongst high-ranking members of the empires. There are records of those artifacts being used until the first century of the Seventh Age of Calimshan , at which point most of them became lost to history.</p>
<p>During the Year of the Leaping Frog, 1266 DR , four lost demonshields were found in a barrow of the Fields of the Dead and brought to the School of Wonder to be studied there.</p>
<p>The thirteenth shield, known as Kuraltaar , was kept in the vaults of the imperium for a long time. It was never used in battle, but was offered to a dragon during the Year of Emerald Eyes, 371 DR .</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Amongst conjurers of the Ulcasterian school the shields were said to be the key to unlocking the secret magics used by Halaster, and as such were highly sought after.</p>
<p>Amongst the Cowled Wizards of Amn , those shields were an object of great unease. Given the populace's distrust of wizards , they believed that unveiling the frightening power of the demonshields could trigger a witch hunt against all practitioners of the Art .</p>
<p>The creation of the demonshields as well as other fiendish artifacts during the Shoon Imperium lead to the creation of the sword Dornavver by the local church of Ilmater .</p>
