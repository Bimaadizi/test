<p>A bard's blade was an enchanted blade that granted the wielder a number of powerful boons and magical abilities. They were known to exist in Faerûn prior to the Spellplague .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This type of blade could appear in the form of a dagger , short sword , or long sword and always possessed a +2 enchantment . Regardless of its shape and size, it offered its wielder limited protected against petrification, unwanted shape-changing, immobilization, and sleep and charm effects.</p>
<p>The blade could neutralize poison by contact and will of the wielder, three times per day.</p>
<p>Additionally, a bard's blade had four spells cast into it upon creation: remove curse , dimension door , limited wish , and time stop . Whenever the wielder grasped the blade and so willed, they could release the effects of one of these spells. These spells could only be "recharged" by a subsequent re-casting of the spell, directed upon the blade itself.</p>
