<p>Star Sapphire was a very rare form of sapphire that exhibited asterism .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Asterism is a reflective optical effect that highlights a white six-pointed star on the surface of cabochon-cut stones. Star sapphires were more opaque than regular gem-quality sapphires . About one in a thousand sapphires was a star sapphire. A typical specimen had a base value of 5,000 gp or 1,000 gp depending on market conditions.</p>
<p>Star sapphires were considered sacred by followers of Callarduran Smoothhands , Corellon Larethian , Deneir , Gaerdal Ironhand , and Luthic â€”appropriate for sacrifice, or to be consecrated for use, or recognized as boons or omens when found.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Star sapphires were often used in making and decorating devices and objects to ward off hostile magic, such as globes of invulnerability , allowing them to be effective against stronger spells. Many spells could be enhanced by adding a star sapphire to the material component. For example, the duration of an antimagic shell could be extended for more than two hours beyond the usual time limit.</p>
<p>Star sapphires were considered prized gems among the drow . They considered it somewhat of a lucky charm for those who could use magic and a very bold choice for others.
