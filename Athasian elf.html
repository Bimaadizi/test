<p>Athasian elves were a race of nomadic elves native to the desert world of Athas , potentially descended from high elves that had settled there in eons past.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Athasian elves were noted for their incredibly slender and lean muscular builds, considered beyond what was possible for humans . However, their slim frames were deceptive, obscuring the fact that they possessed wiry strength, as members of their race were usually in excellent physical condition. Their builds were owed in part to their high metabolism. Additionally, they were denoted for their long limbs and fine-boned facial features, deeply etched into their weather-toughened faces.</p>
<p>Whereas the elven subraces of other worlds were often pale-skinned and delicate, the skin of Athasian elves was rough and rugged from years of exposure to the desert elements and the Athasian sun. Their skin was as varied as that of the other Athasian races of Athas, and as affected by the rays of the sun. and just as affected by that world's sun.</p>
<p>One trait they did share with non-Athasian elves was a subtle transition in physical appearance as they aged, with there being little outward difference between adults and the old, only showing obvious signs once they reach a hundred years of age. However, these were slight and mild compared to Athasian humans that reached a venerable age</p>
<p>These elves grew no body hair, save for the hair on their scalp, which regardless of gender or sex they grew out long and full in a variety of colors, from shades of lightest blond, to red, to brown, and to darkest black. Once they reached venerable age, their hair began to dull and gray. Their native garb was designed to protect them against the desert and its brutal elements, with them often favoring voluminous robes to protect their bodies from the scouring, windblown sand and baking sun. Even when relaxing at an oases or living within cities, these elves tended to prefer their native garb. However, these garbs were not merely uniform, for individual tribes frequently showcased their own customs and traditions through an outfit's design. Whenever an elf chose to voluntarily reject their tribal affiliation, becoming an elf without a tribe, they would traditionally signify this to all they came across by wearing plain brown wrappings.</p>
<p>The average Athasian elf adult stood 6′0.5″‒7′0.5″ (1.84‒2.15 m), which was considered tall by the standards of Athasian humans.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Athasian elves were a very individualistic, free spirited, and self-reliant people, to extreme degrees. Most were possessed of an incurable wanderlust, unmatched in any other Athasian race, and they derived some joy at relenting to this each day. Because of all these factors, elves craved the freedom of open spaces where they could run. While they were usually too swift and canny to be caught by slavers, fleeing at the first sign of trouble, if one ever did get caught and held in captivity by slavery , their body would wither away as the elf gradually suffered claustrophobia, depression , mild panic attacks, or even more physical discomfort.</p>
<p>When it came to their sense of time, Athasian elves typically perceived of the future as bleak and treacherous, where a long life could turn out sad and cheerless, ravaged by centuries of toiling away. Recognizing the inevitability of death and hardship on Athas, they preferred to live in what they called "the now". The "now" being the present, time as it exists, and to them living in the now was perhaps the most important thing in life. They would rather strive and struggle to live every moment (or "every now" as they would say ) of their lives to the fullest and most enjoyable extent possible, even if it meant they lead short lives.</p>
<p>Consequently, dwelling on the past and contemplation of the future were both viewed as wastes of time, something that left the "now" to slip away, and once gone "lost nows" were gone forever. The only exception to the former was when "the past" was being conveyed through song and dance. Their philosophy of living in the moment also rendered them impatient, an unusual trait for elves, always being in a rush. Many detested the drudgery of hard labor, they largely abstained from complicated court intrigues, their emotions seemed to be driven wildly by the whims of the moment. If asked about this, an elf would say that their way of being was simply a reflection of life, as one's fate could change as quickly as the breeze in the desert.</p>
<p>There was no sense of racial unity among the Athasian elves. To them the tribe mattered above all else – everyone within a tribe were considered brethren and equals. Tribesmen were extremely close-knit and would resort to any means necessary to ensure all were kept alive and prosperous. To leave any member behind in the bonds of slavery, even those of the lowest-rankings, was unthinkable. They would do whatever was necessary to secure a tribesman's escape and, if possible, they would try to assassinate the templar responsible for putting them into bondage before fleeing. Some would even resort to offering exorbitant bribes, but with no intention of paying out.</p>
<p>All races outside of one's tribe, even other elves, were regarded as "outsiders" and thus potential enemies. Thus, when in the company of outsiders elves typically keep to itself, camping nearby if need be, rather than directly sleeping alongside with his companions.</p>
<p>Acceptance of an individual outsider, even friendship, was possible. However, an elf's trust was not easily earned. Trust took time to develop and was often associated with great sacrifice or tests. Whenever an outsider displayed characteristics that were deemed redeeming by elven standards, or an outsider was trying to befriend them, an Athasian elf would construct a series of tests of friendship and loyalty to determine their trustworthiness. For instance, the elf might leave a valuable belong out in the open to see the outsider would attempt to steal. Over time, these tests either gradually gained the outsider acceptance with the elf or caused their suspicions to become reinforced. In some cases the severity of these tests could take dangerous turns, veering into perilous situations, before an elf was willing to accept an outsider as their equal. But once it was earned, an Athasian elf was a loyal companion and further tests were considered unnecessary, unless the trust was severely broken.</p>
<p>Though rarer, acceptance of an outsider from a whole elven tribe was possible. However, typically it was awarded when an outsider committed a great sacrifice on their behalf. Even if the outsider died in the process, they would be accepted by the tribe posthumously.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Their eyes exhibited both infravision and low-light vision qualities. Their bodies had a natural resistance to extreme temperatures, being less adversely affected than other Athasian races by the scorching heat of day or the chill of Athasian nights. However, this didn't extend to magical or supernatural heat or cold. Being highly attuned to their desert environment, they had an instinctive sense of when things were out of place, making it harder to fool them with illusion -based spells and effects.</p>
<p>The most defining trait of the Athasian elf was their natural proficiency in long-distance running and sprinting. Blessed with lightning-fast reflexes, uncanny speed and swiftness, they were faster than other elven subraces. They were conditioned to maintain their quick speeds over sandy and rocky terrain. When running or frightened, they produced a pheromonal scent that was both perceptible and alluring to the antennae of Athasian thri-kreen .</p>
<p>The other thing that most distinctly set them apart from the elven subraces of other worlds, was that they generally did not engage in the reverie , but rather slept like other races, complete with dreams and nightmares. This was due in part to them having shorter lifespans. While there were known instances of them experiencing reverie, these were extremely rare. These elves also lacked any sort of magical resistances to charm and sleep -based spells. Whether they simply never developed such resistances, or lost them over time as most of the Athasian races went centuries without use of magic, was unknown.</p>
<p>In place of the reverie, Athasian elves had their own unique meditative state, one called the elf run . When in this state adrenaline flowed through the body, inhibiting any sense of tiredness. They become able to run persistently as far as 40​ to ​50 miles (64,000​ to ​80,000 meters) in a single day and then keep up that grueling pace for another six consecutive days before experiencing fatigue.</p>
<p>When in a group of three or more, even up to an entire tribe, elves can induce a mass elf run , drawing upon the
endurance of a lead runner. This runner usually had to be a tribal chief or head of a clan and an hour of group concentration was needed. When conducting a mass elf run individuals became as one for the length of its duration, drawing upon each others' strengths. When a tribe was determined to get somewhere, even mounted cavalry woulds struggle to catch them. And a war party on the move could prove to be a deadly force.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>The weapons commonly preferred among Athasian elves included falchions , longbows , longswords , rapiers , scimitars , shortbows , and shortswords . Their prowess with such weapons was most exemplary when wielding ones that had been crafted by their own tribe. They often relied upon speed and stealth, taking advantage of an opponent's over reliance on factors such as strength and endurance.</p>
<p>They were quite varied in the paths they took in life, taking up such mantles as defiler wizards , fighters , gladiators , illusionists , preserver wizards , rangers , even templars. However, Athasian elves were most often either rogues or some form of warrior .</p>
<p>As psionics were vital aspect of life on Athas, it was no surprise that some embraced study of it with the same enthusiasm they put towards the martial and thieving arts, becoming psionicists . They were also, on average, the Athasian race most comfortable with arcane magic . In their eyes there was nothing inherently evil about either preserver or defiler wizards. As for priestly magic, while it was quite mysterious to them, it was not unheard of for them to become elemental clerics , devoted to the elements of either earth or fire . Referred to as "element singers", most tribes offered them positions of power and respect. They garnered feelings of awe, as well as to some degree fear, from their peers.</p>
<p>It was unheard of for Athasian elves to be bards and some would say the same for druids , though many of their larger tribes had druids who provided spiritual guidance.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>The most universal aspect of Athasian elf culture was nomadism. They wandered endlessly through the sandy desert wastes, plains, and barrens of Athas. They rarely stayed in one place for long and never constructed anything larger or more permanent than a market tent . However, some tribes did reside in the city-states , such as Balic or Tyr , usually inhabiting their own ghettos.</p>
<p>By and large they were a clannish people, with thousands of different tribes across Athas, each culturally distinct from one another. Depending on a tribe's size, it could consist of a single family or several making up a number of linked clans. Each was led by a chief with an ruling council of advisers, though cheiftains were not bound by the dictates of their councils. In larger tribes, this council could be composed of the leader of each clan within the tribe. In smaller tribes, a chief's advisers were those most experienced in any given task, such as hunting, trading, and being warrior, as well as a tribe's elemental cleric and most powerful wizard.</p>
<p>Whereas elves on other worlds might be found to live as long as 750 years, the harshness of living on Athas rendered the average lifespan of these elves to a mere 140 years.</p>
<p>Their culture, whilst rich and diverse, was considered "savage" by some. However, all cultures of Athas were considered "savage" in one way or another by people of other worlds. When the time for working was, they would engage in long periods of raucous revelry. They were glorious at reveling, performing majestics songs and dances that rivaled many on Athas in terms of their beauty, and had frenzied feasts.</p>
<p>Song and dance were both significant facets of elven culture, serving purposes beyond just an outlet for celebration. They were used as memory aids with the passing down of history and legends, as well as a method to keep time when working or on long runs. Additionally, Elven music was divided into two types, each with its own accompanying dances and songs. There were the music performed in the markets and the music performed amongst one's tribe, the latter of was rarely ever performed before outsiders.</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Despite this revelry and the perception of them as layabouts, due to their cultural philosophy of living in the moment, Athasian elves did in fact labor, in some ways laboring harder than the other Athasian races. As they did not farm, much of their time and energy was spent on hunting and foraging.</p>
<h3>Commerce</h3>
<p>Herding was by far the predominant means by which tribes made a living, but a number of other tribes instead or additionally engaged in commerce or banditry and raiding. On rare ocassions, tribes even worked as mercenaries or engaged in the "shadow arts", the fields of espionage and assassination.</p>
<p>Many of the tribes who engaged in banditry would congregate along the major trade routes, waiting to prey upon heavily laden caravans.</p>
<p>When a tribe was mercantile, the chief's advisory council would handle the various administrative functions expected of a mercantile house. This included account keeping, inventory keeping, and price setting.</p>
<p>Some tribes engaged in trade with the city-states on a more-or-less regular basis, bringing goods ranging from legitimate to illegal, exotic to useless baubles. Each of the great city-states hosted a branch of the "Elven Market", crowded bazaars where the elves dealt in their goods on the edges or outskirts of a city-state's true merchant quarter.</p>
<p>Elven markets were made up of rented dilapidated buildings and semi-permanent stalls, as most tribes weren't wealthy enough to build or maintain proper bartering emporiums. They considered by many to be important sources of contraband, particularly items of the magical variety, such as spell components and other equipment necessary for an Athasian defiler wizard, as well as rare and unusual goods. It was also not uncommon to assume that goods available at the elven markets might be of inferior make or were stolen.</p>
<p>As merchants, Athasian elves wanted to get the most out of any bargain. They were willing to spend long bells haggling and negotiating with potential customers or over the price of a single trade good. They valued maintaining trading relationship and honoring their word, often bartering honestly. However, they abided by no strict code of ethics. If an opportunity presented itself to an elf merchant, they would find it difficult not to take advantage of their customer, misdirect someone, or steal. The more cutthroat elves would even go so far as robbing someone or murdering them for their valuables. Contrastly, Athasian elves did not take kindly to being cheated and might make those fleecing partners "disappear" without a trace, or even worse.</p>
<p>The selling of banned goods within the city-states invariably made elves catch heat with local law enforcement and be pressed into slavery if they could not manage to deceive or escape from the templars. Those forced into bondage were found to be quite competent as farmers, seductive artists, and even gladiators. They bided their time, waiting for the first opportunity to escape and rejoin their tribe. If the option of escaping did not seem readily available, they would attempt to flatter their masters into being promoted to some artistic station. If their tribesmen came to break them out and, as was the case for many such ocassions, killed the templar responsible for putting him into bondage, then the tribe would omit that city-state from their caravan routes for the next few years.</p>
<h3>Travel</h3>
<p>Though they sometimes traveled with beasts, such as crodlus or kanks , Athasian elves always traversed the sandy wastes of Athas on foot, even when running would prove slower or they were traveling with others who were using mounts . The unassuming, domesticated beasts they kept were solely for the purposes of making war, herding, and transporting goods, such as raw materials and baggage like their tents. Kanks were typically the most preferred traveled companions, as few other beasts were capable of catching up with elves if and whenever they broke into a full sprint.</p>
<p>Being as their race was defined by their ability to run, an Athasian elf would never use a mount unless they were badly injured and near death or ill. To do so otherwise was considered dishonorable. This expectation even applied to the pregnant and elderly. Those who could not keep up with their tribe would be left behind.</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>Athasian elves primarily spoke their own language that was noted for its singsong quality. It was made up of short, clipped words, with an abundance of vowels. Native speakers spoke in a rapid staccato pace, but when speaking to those for whom it was their second language they would talk slower so as to be better understood. However, the language was not uniform across the elven tribes. Each added their own nuances, creating whole accents and slang. Additionally, many tribes developed a primitive form of sign language so they could communicate even in crowded spaces full of outsiders.</p>
<p>Most elves knew smatterings of Athasian common, largely for the purpose of trading, and some even knew how to converse in the local gith and pterran languages. However, due to their disdain towards outsiders, it was rare for elves to learn anything more than the common tongue.</p>
<p>Names held great significance to Athasian elves. They took much time and thought in their selection, with tribal leaders considering the process to be one of their most solemn duties. As running was such an integral element of their culture, elves did not receive names until they learned how to run. Until then they would be referred to by descriptive terms or nonsense nicknames, such as "Flop Ears". The first true name they received would be based upon whatever was the first interesting thing they did when initially learning to run. Their name could change as they grew older, as often rites of passage suggested designations that would be more appropriate.</p>
<p>Common given names among Athasian elves included the following:</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>They were considered dangerous by most other races on Athas, having reputations for being lazy, shifty and untrustworthy rogues, thieves, and bandits, who were more than willing to fleece customers that were not of their tribe. Due to their outlooks on life, there were some truths to these stereotypes. Elves in turn often either held other races in contempt or outright ignored them. And many took a sort of perverse pride in the stereotypes surrounding them.</p>
<p>Most were cautious when dealing with them. Being that they were fickle business partners, it was believed that trade with them could go sour at any time. However, despite all of this elven traders were considered to be the most capable on Athas, owing to their expertise in traversing the wilderness and ability to barter with a variety of different races. Even the most officious of templars appreciated the selections on offer at an Elven Market.</p>
<p>Athasian elves posed the most direction competition for the ecological niche that the Athasian thri-kreen filled, hunting much of the same creatures, and harbored both a one-sided enmity and fear towards them. They considered the kreen to be their greatest enemies, to the point that tribes had a dedicated profession for fighting them, the "thri-kreen slayer". The kreen lacked any such strong enmity or equivalent profession. This enmity was born from the Athasian thri-kreen having a well known taste for them. However, but they were far from a staple in the thri-kreen diet, as they preferred to hunt unintelligent prey and would only hunt sapients in times of needs. Many would go their entire leaves without eating an Athasian elf. Whenever an Athasian thri-kreen was forced to hunt sapients, these elves would be their first choice of prey and one tasting of their flesh tended to want more.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The high elf descendants of the Athasian elves came to and settled on the planet Athas sometime during known as the Green Age , though others believed they were among the many races on Athas that had evolved from that world's halflings . According to legends passed down through the ages, these progenitor elves had short and frail bodies. During this period they built and lived in grand citadels, one among them being the prosperous city of Kurn , situated within a vast forest.</p>
<p>In the early days of a period known as the Cleansing Wars , the future sorcerer-king Albeorn sought to bring the elves of Athas to the brink of extinction, devastating the city of Kurn and earning himself the moniker "Slayer of Elves".</p>
<p>On Toril , in The Year of Despair, Malatran calendar, late 14 th century DR , a group of heroes of the Malatran Plateau were sent through an elemental gate to the far-away world of Athas. Immediately upon arrival, the group was captured by Athasian elf slavers. A young thri-kreen named Ka'cha was among creatures captured by the elves, and he lamented being separated from his clutch. Subsequently, the heroes escaped when the elven caravan was attacked by a hungry sink worm . They seized the opportunity and freed Ka'cha, fleeing from the pursuers across the desert.</p>
