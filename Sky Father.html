<p>In Shou Year 894 (−356 DR) , the abbot ordered his monks to create five high-quality placards, and they did so, creating the paper and ink from scratch, blessing the materials, and cutting the paper using a holy blade kept in the monastery. Once complete, the abbot carried the blank cards and the ink into the wilderness on a four-month long retreat of self-purging. When he returned, he had painted powerful holy symbols upon them, creating the enchanted cards called the Edu'sascar .</p>
