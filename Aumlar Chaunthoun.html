<p>Aumlar Chaunthoun was a Zhentarim mage of the mid-14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was no fool, and was willing to limit his goals when facing something dangerous.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He had forged a number of treaties and wills with his own hand. He'd also slain and impersonated a number of people.</p>
<p>One of his spells was a stolen Mulhorandi magic that, consuming horse bones, created a cloud of death that stole the lives of horses to power itself. Another spell, a dream-whisper or whisper-link, allowed him to eavesdrop on the thoughts of a number of people, requiring a hair of each as a material component.</p>
<p>Of note he had the ability to control numerous wands at once from a distance. Another of his spells was a short-range teleportation.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He was carrying a number of wands . He also had a potion of healing and a ring that blocked many magics, but which he did not expect to block spellfire .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Sememmon counted him as someone to respect. During his last mission, he had two bodyguards. The red wizard Pheldred counted as one rival.</p>
<p>The red wizards under Hulrivior were aware of his presence in the place.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of late 1357 DR , Aumlar Chaunthoun had been sent to three different missions as a Zhentarim mageling, and returned successful from each, gaining the organisation control over three or more Sembian companies, a number of influential merchants from Tethyr and Amn , one old-coin family from the same land, all unwittingly. One guildmaster in Waterdeep was aware of his control, but had not raised objections, fearing reprisal. Some years prior, he had cursed Pheldred , a Red Wizard , so that his hands turned into manacles at the most inconvenient times.</p>
<p>That year, Aumlar Chaunthoun was sent to seize spellfire from Shandril Shessair , and to that end he impersonated a finecarver of pipes and horns named Theldarace Norlaund , though he expected he would not succeed at the task and should instead concentrate on learning about spellfire or slaying rivals. During one of the ambushes before Triel , Aumlar cast a spell to try and capture the thoughts of Shandril and Narm.</p>
<p>After confirming his spell worked he discovered he'd been scried on. However, the sensor was dismissed immediately, and before he could draw any conclusions he was attacked by the Red Wizard Pheldred. The battle burned many of his wands and left him gravely injured, but he was the victor. The Cult of the Dragon agents Krostal and Malivur tried to slay him afterwards and he fled with a spell, taking himself towards Narm and Shandril; the latter hurt him greatly, but it was Arauntar who ultimately killed him.</p>
<p>Korthauvar Hammantle and Hlael Toraunt confirmed his death afterwards.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Drauthtar Inskirl thought it trouble if he got spellfire.</p>
