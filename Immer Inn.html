<p>The Immer Inn was a lavish inn found in Immersea known for its superb wine selection and exorbitant prices.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The proprietors spared no expense in an attempt to make this former manor house resemble a palace of sorts. Decorations included gilded columns, brass fern planters, and carved wind charms.</p>
<h2>Activity</h2>
<p>At 30 gold pieces per night the Immer Inn was easily the most expensive place to sleep in Immersea. Each guest was afforded a personal waiter and chambermaids were available on each floor who could be summoned by ringing a bell.</p>
<p>Though there were no single rooms to be had, each suite was connected to a bath chamber, receiving room, and wardrobe. A pair of bedrooms were connected to each suite and were utterly sound-proofed.</p>
