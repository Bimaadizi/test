<p>The leaves of the forest was a set of magical armor found in Thorngap , a druidic circle in Cormyr during the mid-1480s DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The armor was made of a combination of leather, fabric, and living wood and leaves that fitted to the body. It was roughly equivalent to scale mail in function.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The wood joined with the wearer's skin when worn, actively protecting and holding them together in the face of oncoming threats. It made them functionally immune to deep, crippling wounds as a result.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The leaves of the forest were found in Thorngap after adventurers investigated the maddened druid Halsaime and overcame his subordinate druids Thomren , Drien , Larres , Flinbeck , and Garick .</p>
