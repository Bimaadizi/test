<p>Briartan was a High druid from the Circle of Leth charged with the protection of the Mucklestones in the Forest of Lethyr .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Briartan appeared to possess a strange resistance to magical rot.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Briartan was a high druid of the Circle of Leth. In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Briartan's defenses at the Mucklestones were breached when he allowed several blightspawned volodni in; they deceived him, pretending to seek a cure for their condition, but were actually in service to the Talontar blightlord Gameliel . He became able to enter the protected standing stone circle, overpower Briartan, and take control of the Mucklestones.</p>
<p>Gameliel took him captive; the blightlord tortured and mutilated the druid for tendays until released by Ususi Manaallin , Marrec , Gunggari Ulmarra and Elowen . He warned them there were other blightlords, and asked them to bring news of his death, and the Keystone , to the Nentyarch , who ruled at the time from his seat-in-exile in Yeshelmaar . Marrec attempted to heal the druid, but he perished of his wounds soon after anyway.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Briartan was friends with Ususi Manaallin , who often studied the stones, and with the Nentyar hunter Elowen . Per Elowen, he loved meeting people from far away. He coordinated the efforts of his fellows to keep the Mucklestones safe; they sometimes called themselves the 'Mucklefriends', though rarely in the company of strangers.</p>
