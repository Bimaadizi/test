<p>Frinli Hinkille was a quick and confident hin cook of the Yawning Portal in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Kythorn of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Frinli was present at the inn along with her fellow cook Merin Falle and the foul-tempered chef. A squadron of drow assassins emerged from the Yawning Portal's descent to Undermountain and started slaughtering adventurers gathered in its common room. Even though the attackers were repelled back into the dungeon, Frinli's worries over a fellow line cook over- spiceing dishes started to seem like less of an issue.</p>
