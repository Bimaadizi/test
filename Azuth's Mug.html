<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some years after moving to Waterdeep in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , tutoring or performing spells for anyone who was willing to pay him, the wizard Mistmyr Iroan befriended the owner of Crow's Nest. When the tavernkeeper passed away, they bequeathed the ownership of their tavern over to Mistmyr. Using his arcane magic and whatever funds he could scrape together, Mistmyr conducted repairs on the tavern and set up some lightning. Eventually, in the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , the business would reopen under new name Azuth's Mug. Under the new management, the tavern thrived, attracting far greater crowds after one year of operation than it ever did in its previous incarnation.</p>
