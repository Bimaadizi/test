<h2>Habitats</h2>
<h2>Usages</h2>
<p>In Maztica, pigweed was treated as a vegetable by the native Azuposi and was a common part of their diet.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point in the 14 th century DR , a group of rangers introduced giant wasps into the Rimwood of Cormanthor. Their intention was to hopefully drive out the area's fyrefly population by having the giant wasps compete with them for their precious cornflower pollen. However, this proved to be unsuccessful as the fyreflies adapted to eating quack grass and dried pigweed.</p>
