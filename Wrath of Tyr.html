<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tersyus , along with its two more powerful siblings hammers, Bythialarus ( Wisdom of Tyr ) and Ulhaeron ( Mercy of Tyr ), were forged in 750 DR to celebrate the crowning of the Valjevo dynasty in Phlan of the Moonsea . Many centuries later and after the fall of Phlan, these three hammers were unearthed by the Waterdeep 's branch of the Church of Tyr . The Tyrran clerics awarded these hammers to the allies of the church who fought to defeat Tyr's enemies.</p>
<p>Sometime before 1374 DR , Tersyus was gifted to Charissa Maernos , a young paladin of Tyr and a member of the Maernos noble family of Waterdeep. The Open Lord Piergeiron the Paladinson was impressed with the young woman's triumph over a coven of malicious Malarite druids who were spreading pestilence in the Ardeep Forest . However it was unknown if this story was true.</p>
<p>In 1374 DR, Charissa Maernos wielded the Wrath of Tyr during her pursuit of vengeance agains the Night Masks of Westgate who were responsible for her family's downfall.</p>
