<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Aelis used the threat of a growing goblinoid army , to strike out at other druidic groves across the Sword Coast . Working with Olodan and two other Shadow Druids, Aelis convinced Kagha of the Emerald Grove to begin the Rite of Thorns ritual, which would protect and shield away the grove from any outsiders. Aelis planned to use that event to take the Emerald Grove under the control of the Shadow Druid circle.</p>
<p>As Aelis' plan was being carried out, they embarked from the Cloak Wood for the city of Baldur's Gate .</p>
