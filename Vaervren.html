<p>Vaervren was an elven wild rice dish with its name derived from the word "vaerve" which meant "freshwater shallows," referencing the rice being harvested in such waters.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This simple dish began with onions and forest mushrooms sautéed in wild boar fat until soft, with chopped leeks added in later. The vegetables were cooked together for a duration of a long elven song and seasoned with salt , pepper , powdered marjoram , rosemary , and thyme . After this, elven cooks added wildfowl broth to the vegetables and dried wild rice. The broth was brought up to a rolling boil, covered, and simmered on low heat for fifteen minutes. The rice mix was next taken off the heat and allowed to cool down for five minutes, still covered. Before serving, vaervren was mixed with heavy cream and crumbled cheese , preferably askata or Elturian Grey . If in a pinch, Green Calishite cheese was an acceptable option.</p>
<p>Some Fair Folk finished the dish by adding diced pear or quince .</p>
