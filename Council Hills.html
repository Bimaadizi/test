<p>The Council Hills were a clump of hills in the Eastern Shaar where the territories of several Shaaran tribes met.</p>
<h2>Locations</h2>
<p>The hills were home to the long-destroyed city of Shandaular and have since been mere ruins. Beneath the hills were remains of the old city, a series of underground tunnels. The tribesmen of the Shaar used the more superficial tunnels and passageways as tombs to honor their dead, respecting the sanctity of undisturbed crypts.</p>
