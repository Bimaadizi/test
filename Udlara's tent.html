<p>Udlara's tent was an enchanted tent belonging to Udlara Thaerintauhn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>On the outside, the tent was dinghy and small.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The tent was somewhat similar in power to Daern's instant fortress , though far weaker. It was impossible to cut without powerful enchanted weapons, impervious to normal weapons or even those of bare enchantment. It was small, but opened into a much larger space; with a command word, it could be made to fold and shrink itself, alongside all its contents, though it could not activate this while there were living beings inside. Finally, no insect could enter it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
