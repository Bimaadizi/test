<p>Gharri Wondermaker ( pronounced : /ˈ dʒ ɑːr i / JAR-ee ) was a famous and powerful cleric of Gond who oversaw the Temple of Gond Wondermaker in Tilverton until 1357 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Gharri was extremely clever and perceptive, and was skilled at diplomacy with a sharp wit.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>As a high priest of Gond, Gharri was reputed to have possession of a great wealth in trade bars and coins , as well as magical items and rare mechanical devices. After his death in 1357 DR, any such hoard of treasure remained undiscovered.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gharri was born in the Sembian city of Yhaunn but was orphaned by a great fire, spending much of his youth with traveling priests of Gond. In time, he rose through their ranks and eventually founded the Temple of Gond Wondermaker in Tilverton , the largest temple of Gond in the Eastern Heartlands . He became the de facto ruler of Tilverton sometime prior to 1337 DR, which prospered thanks to innovations in manufacturing and the crafting of small, high-quality items such as toothed gears, locks, and hinges.</p>
<p>When Tilverton came under threat by the Zhentarim , Lashan Aumersair , and warbands of orcs and goblins in 1356 DR , he accepted the aid of Cormyr's Purple Dragons to save the city from destruction. In Flamerule of that year, he accepted the annexation of Tilverton as a protectorate of Cormyr, and took the position of Lord Regent of the city. During this time, he secretly met and developed a relationship with the rogue Princess Alusair Obarskyr , who had fled her father's court and become an adventurer . As he realized his powerlessness in the face of the Dragon Throne, Gharri suddenly disappeared from the city with Alusair in Mirtul of 1357 DR . They traveled together for a few months, but their relationship turned sour and they separated after a fight. Gharri met with the Knights of Myth Drannor , who secretly set him up in Castle Krag in Shadowdale , where he oversaw the local clergy of Gond and operated them as a spy ring.</p>
<p>Later in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , he traveled to Daggerdale to fight alongside Randal Morn in his war against the Zhentarim . Gharri met his end in a titanic battle against a dozen Zhent mages near Serpentsbridge , with almost no one being aware of his passing.</p>
