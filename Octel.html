<p>Octel was the common name for scheelite in the Realms. Jewelers sometimes marketed them as savage fire .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This fancy stone occurred in hues ranging from pale yellow to orange and could be facet cut or sliced and polished for inlay work. Large but irregular specimens were mounted with silver as pendants, and imaginative jewelers sold them as "savage fire". Octel was a soft stone but when properly faceted yielded beautiful, sparkling gems. A typical octel had a base value of 100 gp.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Octel gems could be permanently "awakened" by touching them to a ring of free action . Once awakened, their natural inner fire became a faint light source with a radius of about 2 ft (60 cm) in dark places. An awakened octel prevented all magical paralyzation or hold effects from operating on beings touching or carrying it.</p>
