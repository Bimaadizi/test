<p>A potion of forgetfulness was a draught that destroyed the drinker's memories.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>If drank on its own, it caused forgetting of all that was experienced in the last 24 hours, including memorized spells . If split in quarters, adding a quarter of the potion to a non-alcoholic beverage produced a memory lapse of all mundane declarative knowledge only, which lasted only one to four hours half of the time. Adding it to an alcoholic beverage caused nothing but a rage in the drinker and a terrible taste.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Such potions could be made out of obliviax .</p>
