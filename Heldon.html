<p>Heldon was a farming village in outlying Athalantar until the Year of the Flaming Forests, 224 DR , later the site of an armed camp.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The city had a smithy, a mill, and at least two towers of different heights.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>To the south of Heldon was a curve of the Delimbiyr River . At a higher elevation than the settlement proper, there was a meadow. A high ravine separated it from Heldon, and there was a cave on the end of that ravine. West of Heldon were the Horn Hills .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Sheep were raised around Heldon.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 210Â DR , Prince Elthryn Aumar married Amrythale Goldsheaf of Heldon. Of note, their son Elminster Aumar was born two years later.</p>
<p>The village was razed by Undarl , riding the red dragon Glathkarlarrogh , on behalf of the Magelords of Athalantar , in the Year of the Flaming Forests, 224 DR ; he was there to slay Elthryn and his kin, and slew everyone in sight for good measure. There was only one survivor: Elthryn's son, Elminster, whom Undarl left for dead early on.</p>
<p>After its destruction, a palisade wall was built around a new armed camp at some point on or prior to Year of Bloodflowers, 234 DR .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>There was a shrine to Chauntea south of Heldon.</p>
<p>Of note, there was a meadow atop the village, and a cave hidden somewhere under that meadow, known to almost none outside Elminster.</p>
