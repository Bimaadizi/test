<p>Hawklin was a noble house of Cormyr active in the 14 th and 15 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Generations of Hawklins served in the Purple Dragons or adventured in service to the Crown of Cormyr. However, they achieved noble status relatively late compared to most other noble families.</p>
<p>In the 1360s DR , the then family head Barandos Hawklin was only the third generation of the family to be treated as nobility. Heading Crown-chartered adventuring companies , he had distinguished himself on adventures in the Stonelands and Hullack Forest . He was a favorite at court thanks to his charm and wit.</p>
<p>A century late, the Hawklins were a prominent family around 1479 DR . The family was militaristic and advocated increasing military spending to fight a war against Netheril , which they believed was inevitable.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The family was based in Suzail at Hawklin House and had holdings in Thunderstone .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The family lacked estates and businesses that yielded an income, but rumors claimed the vaults of Hawklin House contained much wealth won or looted from adventuring as well as riches gained in rewards.</p>
