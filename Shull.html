<p>Shull was not content with his meager ability, and sought out more powers with the hope of taking over his clan. Shull sought out the Godfather of Gracklstugh and was directed to solicit the mind flayer Ir , another powerful psionicist. Shull embarked on a long voyage, fighting off cloakers and aboleths , and finally made it to the mind flayer's lair in a deep chasm.</p>
<p>Ir taught Shull how to read the minds of others and bend them to his will. But Shull was not content, and wished to destroy others' minds outright. Ir granted Shull's wish and bestowed upon him a blessing that would allow him to shatter a single mind but once, before the power became lost forever.</p>
