<p>Thrusk was a hardy wild grass often used for making infusions .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Thrusk grew in tufts. It had roots that ran deep, making it very hardy and resistant to droughts and heatwaves.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>An infusion was commonly made from its roots and leaves. The infusion had a number of properties, being bitter but giving a feeling of warmth to the chest, clearing foul tastes from the mouth, and quickly eliminating any headache not due to a severe head-wound. It was popular amongst caravan drivers for those properties.</p>
<p>The flavor the root itself gave to the infusion was bitter and ropy, akin to licorice . It was an acquired taste, and even for cattle it was only sustenance grazing, as they would prefer to graze on just about anything else given a choice.</p>
<p>Dipping currant-studded hardbread in thrusk made a meal known as daybreak-swallow .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thrusk was drunk in Orthil Voldovan 's caravan during its passage from Scornubel to Waterdeep late in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR .</p>
