<p>Coins of Life were enchanted coins dispensed by the Church of Waukeen in exchange for a large donation, in Samarach on the Chultan Peninsula .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These golden coins bore the likeness of the Marchant's Friend, the goddess of trade and commerce— Waukeen .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Coins of Life were intercessions of two deities, Waukeen and Kelemvor . Each coin represented Waukeen's purchase of Kelemvor's powers over the dead. Each Coin of Life possessed the power to bring back a recently deceased creature. To tap into its divine magics, a coin had to be placed under the dead individual's tongue.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Coins of Life first appeared several years following Waukeen's return after being presumed dead for a decade. The Church of Waukeen in Samarach quickly grew in popularity, and eventually, these coins became quite popular by the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR .</p>
