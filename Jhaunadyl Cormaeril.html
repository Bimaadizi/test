<p>Jhaunadyl Cormaeril was a member of the Cormaeril family as known to Elminster .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>During his infiltration of the Rightful Conspiracy in early spring of 1373Â DR , Elminster was mind-scried by Thauvas , a Red Wizard of Thay . Rather than prevent the mind-reading, he conjured up the faces of two Cormaerils he knew, one of them Jhaunadyl, in the aftermath of some lovemaking. Thauvas was displeased by what he saw; whether it was a true memory of them, or one of them was Elminster, or the whole thing was a mental fabrication was ambiguous.</p>
