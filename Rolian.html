<h2>History</h2>
<p>Rolian was a member of the Frostfire Banner when they took on High Duke Horostos 's assignment to search for the reason why all animals larger than one's hand, as well as most people, were vanishing on the road between Starmantle and Ripplestones .</p>
<p>They were ambushed on their first night out of Starmantle by a chiming mist, the Slayer . Rolian did notice the sound, but when he warned Paeregur , the latter moved to the edge of the cliff where they'd stopped to check up on Arvas . In the few moments while Paeregur's back was to Rolian, the Slayer struck at him, disintegrating him; by the time Paeregur noticed, Rolian's clothes fell over, and split in three pieces.</p>
