<p>Ulbror was an orc chieftain of the orc kingdom of Vastar in the 6th century DR .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Wyvernfall, 512 DR , Ulbror led an orcish horde out of Vastar and marched them east through many small passes over the Earthspur Mountains . They invaded the uplands of Impiltur , where they were met by a small army led by King Sharaun Mirandor . The orcs destroyed the Impilturan army, killing Sharaun and his three sons in battle and thus ending the Mirandor dynasty.</p>
<p>Later that year, Duke Harandil Durlaven had mustered another army and met Ulbror's horde in the Battle of Bloody Reeds . This time, the orcs were routed and Harandil was crowned king.</p>
