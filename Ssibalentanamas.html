<p>Ssibalentanamas was the priest in charge of the yuan-ti breeding program that took place in the catacombs beneath the Cathedral of Emerald Scales in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . He was also the First Consort of the ruler of Hlondeth , Dediana Extaminos .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As the First Keeper of the Sacred Eggs, Ssibalentanamas controlled the histachii that guarded and tended the hundreds of yuan-ti eggs that were incubated in brood chambers deep below the Cathedral of Emerald Scales. Ostensibly, he was breeding an army to defend Hlondeth, but only he and the high priestess Medusanna Mhairdaul knew the full extent of the program.</p>
<p>As the First Consort, he attended Dediana Extaminos, but he was not the father of Dmetrio Extaminos .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Ssibalentanamas was in a unique position, being the ally of Medusanna and the consort of Dediana, since the two females detested each other and came close to trading blows on at least a few occasions.</p>
