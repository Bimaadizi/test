<p>Caer Callidyrr , also known as Callidyrr , was the walled capital city of the Ffolk people on the Moonshaes island of Alaron , as well as the Kingdom of Callidyrr , overlooking Whitefish Bay . It was the seat of the High Kings and Queens of the Ffolk .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Caer Callidyrr was a sprawling port city that stood in the shadow of the massive and splendid castle that shared the city's name, Caer Callidyrr . The city had numerous paved roads, alleys, and stairways that webbed its four quarters surrounding the great open square – the Market Square , located below the towering castle. The city's quarters were: the Castle Quarter in the northwest, the Forest Quarter in the southwest, the Plains Quarter in the southeast, and the Dock Quarter in the northeast. The Fairheight Road ran west from the Market Square, separating the Castle and Forest Quarters, while the High King's Road ran south from the market and separated the Forest and the Plains Quarters.</p>
<p>Like many other cities, Callidyrr had slums.</p>
<p>The city's harbor in Whitefish Bay was protected by the breakwater and a seawall created by the druids .</p>
<p>Underneath Caer Callidyrr laid a network of storm sewers that drained through the seawall and even deeper underground, a network of the Caverns of Callidyrr was hidden, once inhabited by the duergar .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The City of Callidyrr had two major roads that crossed its quarters and stretched beyond. The Fairheight Road ran from the city's Market Square northwest along the fortress's side and reached the Fairheight Mountains . The High King's Road was the second major road and an important highway of the isle of Alaron that ran south.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Just like the entirety of the Kingdom of Callidyrr, the city of Caer Callidyrr was ruled by His Highness, High King Sovereign of Callidyrr and monarch of all the lands of the Ffolk. King Reginald Carrathal held the title circa the Year of the Bloodbird, 1346 DR and after the rebellion of the same year, the Crown of the Isles was claimed by Tristan Kendrick . The title then passed to his heir, High Queen Alicia Kendrick , and to her descendants. By the late 15 th century DR, the title was held by Derid Kendrick .</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>The Ffolk inhabitants of Caer Callidyrr were generally considered to be friendly and accustomed to the visitors from across the Sword Coast . The city was a bright and cheerful setting of busy markets, fabled weaponsmiths, and abundant entertainment of musicians, minstrels , and bards . The city streets were always hosting musicians performing their music for the citizens daily, making many guests mistakingly confuse an ordinary day for a festival. The music typically consisted of Ffolk bards, Waterdhavian minstrels, and pipe players of Calimshan. It was virtually impossible to avoid ever-present singing and music. Its many taverns were relatively quiet, pleasant, and clean, which was not typical for similar port cities.</p>
<p>Unlike music, magic was somewhat rare in Caer Callidyrr.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The city was a busy, bustling hub of trade and barter. It was the biggest and the wealthiest city of the Moonshaes, with a small flotilla of fishing vessels entering and leaving the bay daily. The city's shipyards constructed sturdy seafaring vessels, and docks provided anchorage to many trade galleons and longships . Mechanical pulley-operated cranes were seen rising above the water, transporting catch to nearby canneries that dotted the shores.</p>
<p>Caer Callidyrr had busy naval trade routes that connected it to several important trade hubs. The route to Waterdeep was a journey of about eight days, and the Ffolk merchant sold their fine steel , buying oil , spices , and cloth from the inhabitants of north Faerûn . The route to Calimport provided the Moonsaes with silks , fine fabrics, spices, parchment , and horses while supplying Calimport with steel and weapons . Within the Sea of Moonshae , Caer Callidyrr sold fine weapons to Corwell and bought ales , sheepand horses, and able-bodied workers, while Moray bought weapons and steel and sold ores and coal . Lastly, the isle of Mintarn bought lumber from Caer Callidyrr.</p>
<p>Caer Callidyrr was known for producing and exporting thick Callidyrr mead . Valuable illicit trade goods found on the streets of Callidyrr after dark included Calishite ginyak weed as well as able-bodied slaves from Amn and Tethyr .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The city was protected by the Scarlet Guard , the mercenary company loyal to the High King. The Guard was split into four brigades, each overseeing its quarter of Caer Callidyrr. Each brigade, in turn, was split into individual companies, each of which had its own insignia that was flown in streaming pennants atop the Callidyrr castle. Their uniform consisted of bright red cloaks and helmets topped with tall red plumage. The first three brigades consisted of human veterans and mercenaries. The fourth brigade, however, possessed an awe and terror-inspiring reputation – the ogre brigade.</p>
<p>The Callidyrr dragoons were famed defenders of the realm and the capital city in the 15 th century DR, founded by the High Queen Alicia Kendrick , when the Moonshaes were plagued by Amnian invaders, ravaging lycanthropes , and giants . Their ranks were filled from the acomplished members of the High King's elite guard. They were not part of the kingdom's army but served as special agents of the crown.</p>
