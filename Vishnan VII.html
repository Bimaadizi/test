<p>Vishnan VII was a priest-king of the Kuong Kingdom in Malatra in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>His mother was Lady Natiya , who remained as a dowager and advisor to her son.</p>
<p>His brother was Divine Prince Puran .</p>
<p>Vishnan had three wives and twelve consorts. With these, he had nine legitimate children, the eldest of whom, Novice-Prince Kavayah II , was his heir presumptive.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Aged 35 around 1357 DR, Vishnan was an utterly authoritarian leader with a regal manner. He would take advice only when he asked for it, and after he had made a decision only his mother could change his mind.</p>
<p>He preferred conducting temple ceremonies to going on military campaigns, despite being an able sohei .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As Priest-King, Vishnan VII dominated the absolute monarchy and theocracy of the Kuong Kingdom, serving as both head of civil government and leader of the church venerating the Lords of Creation . His authority was unquestioned and his power was full and far-reaching. Moreover, the Priest-Kings were believed to be divine, and the Kuong viewed him with awe. He was aided by a few advisors and councilors of his choosing, as well as senior priests. His chief advisor was his mother, Lady Natiya; she instilled her imperial ambitions in him.</p>
<p>Vishnan was noted for often dismissing irresponsible or incompetent bureaucrats and appointing replacements.</p>
<p>He ruled from the capital city of Ranguri .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hungry for its prosperous agricultural lands and spurred by Natiya's dreams of empire, Vishnan called for a new assault on the northern nation of Laothan in the 1350s DR. He placed his brother Puran as general of the "army of conquest". His spies in King Thok Lian 's court told of the Seng 's poor defenses and internal conflicts and the carelessness of Kwang Tre 's defenders. Moving covertly, the Kuong army of conquest began marching north in 1357 DR , going through the Purang hill country and entering Laothan in secret.</p>
