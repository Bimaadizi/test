<p>Rift rose was a type of flowering plant, a variety of rose , found growing only in the Spellplagued Chasm of Neverwinter . Its flowers had a strangely beautiful appearance.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the course of their duties defending Neverwinter from the Chasm, Private Olliver of Scar Company noticed that Private Mara Taliren was still despondent over becoming heavily spellscarred . Seeking to cheer her up a bit, Olliver had someone collect the local rift roses and present them "from an admirer." Shocked and confused by the unexpected gift, Mara was still pleased by the gesture.</p>
