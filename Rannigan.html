<p>He was an associate of Loravyre Impkith , a tiefling wizard and fellow member of the Neverwinter Guard.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Rannigan recruited tiefling adventurers in the Blacklake District of the city to carry out some missions in opposition to the Ashmadai , such as getting proof of affiliation from disguised cultists. He also wanted to warn the violent Nashers branch of the Sons of Alagondar against the devil-worshipers, as he believed the Ashmadai were a much graver threat to the city. To this end, he had the adventurer put up warning posters.</p>
<p>Some time later, Rannigan traveled east to Helm's Hold to continue his investigation against the Ashmadai cult, but remained stuck outside the city's gates during the Siege of Helm's Hold . Working alongside Brother Satarin , he discovered that some of the pact blades used by the Ashmadai warlocks were not pacted to the archdevil Asmodeus .</p>
