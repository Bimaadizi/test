<p>The Bloodswords was a mercenary company that originated in Amn and operated within the Western Heartlands during the mid-14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>These mercenaries had an agreement with the Zhentarim where they would drive away any non- Zhent caravans and unwanted travelers in the region of the High Road north of the Bridge of Fallen Men and west of the Eagle Peak in the Storm Horns . They would openly fight with any patrols from Cormyr or adventurers who attempted to cross their territory and would only allow certain Amnian merchants to travel eastward into the mountain pass.</p>
<p>Thanks to the efforts of the Bloodswords, exclusive trade routes to the nations of Amn and Tethyr , within the Lands of Intrigue , opened up to the Zhent forces.</p>
