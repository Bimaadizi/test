<p>Death's Handmaiden were a variety of large scythes created by the fanatics of the New Darkness, the deity Iyachtu Xvim for the single purpose of murder, sometime in the mid-14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A Death's Handmaiden scythe was a large two-handed scythe with awesome power, a terrifying instrument of death. These scythes were meant to show the deity and his followers' disdain for other gods, especially those who held the domain over murder and death, whom Xvim thought to be unworthy as they were former mortals. A Death's Handmaiden made Xvim's followers ensure that no living being was beyond the deity's touch of his fury.</p>
<p>Each of these scythes bore a powerful +4 enchantment weaved into its keen blades, which made the damage dealt more deadly and guided the wielder's hand toward the target. The weapons were also enchanted to possess a vampiric regeneration that gradually healed the wielder from the enemy blood spilled in battle.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These weapons were created by the Church of Iyachtu Xvim relatively shortly before the god was transformed and was used for the rebirth of his father, the deity of tyranny, Bane . Some of these scythes found a way into the hands of the inhabitants of Shadow Mulsantir , a dark reflection of the Rashemen city of Mulsantir in the Shadowfell .</p>
