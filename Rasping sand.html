<p>Rasping sand was a deadly magical sand found in Zakhara , the Land of Fate, that tore away at any surface..</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When thrown, this sand tore both living and non-living surfaces for three full minutes before expiring. Against non-living material one handful of rasping sand would literally destroy up to 100 pounds (45 kg) of the object in question.</p>
<p>Living creatures suffered increasingly devastating damage while the sand eroded their flesh.</p>
<p>Despite its terrifying reputation, rasping sand could be easily counteracted with a gallon of water per handful of sand. The water would instantly negate the sand, causing it to dissolve.</p>
<p>Anyone wishing to throw a handful of rasping sand needed to wear a protective glove or risk becoming the object of its deadly affection.</p>
