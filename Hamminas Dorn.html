<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Hamminas Dorn was the Lord Speaker of the Council of Tarmalune, the leader of the councilors. Because of his position as Lord Speaker, he was the de facto mayor of the city. He was also the leader of Tarmalune's police force, the Vigilant .</p>
<p>While he was popular among honest traders and citizens who were grateful for his compromises towards law and peace, Hamminas faced a strong opposition among corrupt merchants and other citizens whose interests were thwarted by Hamminas's efforts to rout evil from Tarmalune. However, even his opposition grudgingly regarded him as both competent and vitally necessary for the success of the city, and some of his opposition didn't act against him because they believed that harming him was equivalent to harming Tarmalune's prosperity. Among his most fierce opposition was Rathgar Malynd , a mercenary captain who led the Battle Hounds mercenary company.</p>
<p>Because of his many detractors, Hamminas had trained many Vigilants who earned his trust to replace him as Lord Speaker if necessary.</p>
