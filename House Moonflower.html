<h2>History</h2>
<p>Zaor Moonflower ( 572 DR ) reigned from the Year of Twelve Teeth, 888 DR and died on Ches 2 , the Year of Chains, 1321 DR . He was succeeded by his second wife and Queen, Amlaruil Moonflower ( 611 DR ), who was known as the Sad Queen. The couple officially bore thirteen children: seven daughters and six boys. Zaor and Amlaruil were the parents of their oldest daughter Princess Ilyrana , and twins Prince Zhoron and Xharlion . Afterwards, the two parents married. Next came Prince Chozzaster , Princess Shandalar , and two more sets of twin girls, Princesses Tira'allara and Hhora and then Princesses Lazziar and Gemstarzah . Many years later, they had four more children, first Princess Amnestria , then Prince Zandro , Prince Finufaranell , and lastly Prince Lamruil ( 1272 DR ). Via Amnestria, the parents had two grandchildren, one was a secret son with former moon elven noble Elaith Craulnober (known by herself, Lamruil and her future love Bran) and the other was the half-elf Arilyn Moonblade with human ranger Bran Skorlsun .</p>
<p>Eldest daughter Ilyrana was a priestess of Angharradh . eldest sons Zhoron and Xharlion trained as fighters as they were robust as their father. Chozzaster dedicated himself to magic and became a High Mage . Shandalar chose the path of the bladesinger . Tira'allara and Hhora trained as priestesses of Hanali Celanil . Lazziar and Gemstarzah worked as diplomats to the mainland elves. Amnestria loved the life of the solitary adventurer, but was Zaor's favorite child. Zandro and Finufaranell were mages and studied in the Towers . Lamruil was a mischievous young man more human than most, followed Amnestria as an adventurer, but he favored gambling and wenching.</p>
<p>Either eldest Prince Zhoron or Xharlion was devoured by the Elf-Eater , and the other twin's fate is unknown; both may have met this end. Princesses Lazziar and Gemstarzah vanished during a diplomatic mission. Prince Chozzaster voluntarily died young to enter Arvandor . Princess Shandalar died during her bladesinger training. Princess Tira'allera entered into a disastrous relationship with a noble elf, and died of heartbreak; Princess Hhora married a chance-met commoner and disappeared into the High Forest of Faerûn . Eldest Princess Ilyrana later took the Elf-Eater to Arvandor in the hopes of defeating it, it was unknown if she ever returned. The youngest Princess Amnestria was banished by the nobility to the mainland after bearing a half-elven child, her second child, but died during the late 1320s or early 1330s DR. The fates of wizards Prince Zandro and Prince Finufaranell were not told. Youngest Prince Lamruil, despite his early habits, successfully drew one the most powerful elven moonblades , known as the King's Blade after Kymil Nimesin fled Evermeet. Upon Amlaruil's return to Evermeet, the youngest prince left with Maura Silverhand at the Queen's private request to build a kingdom with the Tree of Souls in the distant north, later known as Auseriel .</p>
<p>In 1380 DR , Lamruil left Auseriel with elven high mage Araevin Teshurr to search for his Princess Maura.</p>
<p>With the rise of the Spellplague after 1385 DR , Queen Amlaruil mysteriously disappeared, leading to Evermeet's council later creating the Royal Council by 1479 DR .</p>
<p>It was currently unknown of the surviving House Moonflower members by the end of the Second Sundering .</p>
