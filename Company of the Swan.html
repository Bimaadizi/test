<p>The Company of the Swan was a band of former adventurers who fought together in their prime years and retired together at the Nellie Thursday Home for Experienced Adventurers retirement home once old age claimed them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After surviving the trials and tribulations of the adventuring life into old age, the group settled down in a retirement home to while away their remaining days. Like most of the home's residents, they had spent most of their riches during their careers and were relatively poor; however, even this was enough to be provided a comfortable life with small luxuries.</p>
<p>However, resentment from one of their members towards the rest forced the group to venture forth once more long after they thought their adventuring days were behind them.</p>
