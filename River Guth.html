<p>The River Guth was a small river found in Thindol on the Chultan Peninsula of southwest Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The river originated in the Hazur Mountains in northeast Thindol. It flowed southwest for approximately 100 miles (160 kilometers) before emptying into the Great Sea at the far northern arm of the Thingulph . The river also served as the northern boundary for the Guthland .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The waters of the River Guth were only navigable by boat for a few miles above its terminus. No bridges were constructed across the river and the only ford lay beyond a point where boats could safely travel.</p>
<p>Gold dwarves carved a cart road along the river's northern banks. The same dwarves carved watchposts into the cliffs overlooking the river.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Since the dwarves were not populous enough to keep all of their watchposts fully manned themselves, they often hired humans as guards to fill any vacant spots.</p>
