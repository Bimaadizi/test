<p>The Jade River , a portion of which was later named the Barren River , was a once-massive waterway that flowed through central Threskel , one of the Old Empires of east Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It began in the western peaks of the Riders to the Sky mountain range and flowed westward, south of the city Mordulkin , before emptying into the Bay of Chessenta .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The green waters of the Jade River rushed down the mountainside before leveling out and flowing lazily across the plains of Threskel.</p>
<p>The river's color originated was caused by both naturally-forming algae and industrial waste caused by dwarven mines in the Riders' mountains.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the landscape of Threskel changed following the events of the Spellplague in the Year of Three Streams Blooded, 1384 DR , the Jade River became no more. A massive plateau erupted from the plains, creating a small lake known as the Jade Pond and a much smaller waterway that share the Jade's mouth at the Bay of Chessenta, known as the Barren River .</p>
