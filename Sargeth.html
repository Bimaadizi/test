<p>Originally one of the Knights of Athalantar that turned to banditry after the coronation of Belaur Aumar and the rise of the Magelords of Athalantar , Sargeth led one band of outlaws during Hammer of the Year of the Loremasters, 228 DR , which numbered six: himself, Nind , Eladar (an alias of then-Prince Elminster Aumar ), Baerold , Arghel , and Engarl . Together, they ambushed and slew a band of a dozen armsmen of Athalantar under cover of snow; he personally slew at least one. They returned to the cave where they were hidden, Lawless Castle after; there he learned from Javal , another outlaw, that two more armsmen had been slain near Daera 's, close to Heldreth's Horn .</p>
<p>However, their hideout was discovered by a second patrol and attacked. Sargeth took a crossbow bolt through the eye in that fight.</p>
