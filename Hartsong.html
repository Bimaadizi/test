<p>Hartsong was the longbow of the Faerûnian goddess Mielikki , the Supreme Ranger.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>After the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR , Mielikki sometimes used a bow, but its arrows struck not to inflict injury but to bring life—where they landed, forest plants appeared and grew in a matter of moments, even entangling whoever she wished.</p>
<p>After the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Hartsong was a +5 speed composite longbow that put the full force of her strength behind its arrows.</p>
