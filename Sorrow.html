<p>Sorrow was a unique, enchanted glaive that gradually twisted the soul of the wielder over time.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Every time the wielder of Sorrow wielded another creature with its place, their psyche became a little more fractured and damaged. It was said that every drop of blood tarnished their soul, a process that would continue until nothing else remained.</p>
<p>The wielder could use Sorrow to magically ensnare their foe in a tangle of vines.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was said to have once belonged to the "shade" of an individual, or perhaps a member of the shade species. [ speculation ] It was taken from that individual around the time Ketheric Thorm was defeated, and the shadow curse spread outward from Moonrise Towers .</p>
<p>As of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Sorrow remained stored in a secret vault within the depths of the Emerald Grove .</p>
