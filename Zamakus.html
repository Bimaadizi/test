<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Captain Zamakus had a commanding presence and a serious attitude towards his duty.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Zamakus was a trusted Captain of the guard in Mulmaster on the Moonsea . In the winter of 1373 DR, Zamakus supervised a gemstone golem march in celebration of the marriage anniversary between Mulmaster's High Blade Selfaril Uoumdolphin and Thayan Tharchioness Dmitra Flass . A dozen of exuberantly expensive golems were sent from Thay by Ambassador Reyvan as a demonstration of power and, as later became apparent, an assassination attempt. Under Zamakus's and his guards' watchful eyes, the impressive parade marched from the harbors of Mulmaster towards the city's Thayan Enclave where the celebration was taking place. During the parade, Zamakus briefly exchanged words with the Hero of Daggerford and his companions, who were searching for a way into the sinister southern enclave.</p>
