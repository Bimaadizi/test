<h2>Regions</h2>
<h3>Lands of Intrigue</h3>
<h3>Western Heartlands</h3>
<p>These extensive lands that stretched from the Sword Coast in the west, to Cormyr and the Dragon Coast in the east, with the nation of Amn and the Cloud Peaks forming its southern border. This land was not a unified realm, but rather consisted of a series of city-states, that included Baldur's Gate , Berdusk , Beregost , Elturel , Evereska and Scornubel . and a number of lesser regions and separate kingdoms.</p>
<h3>Moonshae Isles</h3>
<p>These cold, rocky isles formed an archipelago to the west of the Sword Coast. There were several major islands and many hundreds of smaller islands in this group. The terrain forms a mixture of mountains, bogs and woods, with only a handful of towns among them, including Caer Callidyrr on the island of Alaron and Caer Corwell on Gwynneth .</p>
<h3>Island Kingdoms</h3>
<p>The myriad islands in the Sea of Swords and beyond were largely independent from one other, with varied cultures, ideological beliefs, and histories. While often culturally separate from one another, the people from these islands often shared common ancestry and cultures with those from the mainland of Faer没n.</p>
