<p>Memnon , a key port of trade for Calimshan , was the former capital of the efreeti kingdom of Memnonnar .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Memnon was situated on the northern border of the Calim Desert , at the mouth of the River Agis , and along the Trade Way .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>While the official ruler of the city in 1370 DR was Sultan Arin yn Kahar el Sujil , the real power was in the hands of his vizar , Anders el Gnurlbrach . Despite being a half-orc , since at least 1357 DR , Anders was very popular both with the general populace of Memnon and with the syl-pasha of Calimshan. This was in part because he established an elected city council.</p>
<h3>Military</h3>
<p>Memnon served as the northernmost naval base for the Qysanallojal , Calimshan's navy. The ships docked here were the smallest and fastest in the fleet, designed for scouting and anti-piracy purposes. In 1357 DR , the navy was growing so quickly that fishermen were being forced to find new docks.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Memnon was a key trade city for Calimshan. It was that kingdom's northernmost port, and nearly all caravaneers on the Trade Way stopped there for at least a day regardless of whether they were traveling north or south, as Memnon was on the edge of the Calim Desert . The city thus served the function of a massive caravanserai , offering inns, stables, repairs, supplies, or entertainment to those who'd just survived the trek across the desert or to those about to make it.</p>
<p>Additionally, Memnon was considered a fishing town, producing both a high quantity and a high quality of fish, shrimp, and shellfish of many varieties. .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 1340s DR , Conner and Vaji ran confidence tricks in all the major cities of Calimshan, including Memnon, before they went on to Manshaka .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Vajra, Conner, and Salabak sailed back into Memnon on the trail of the mage Chancil Crystalheart . However, his thugs and apprentices waylaid them with a wand of telekinesis , hurling them high into the air. Fortunately their fall was broken by an orange-seller's stall, and they were surrounded by eager-to-help beggars, which Salabak drove off with the illusion of a squealer . They followed Chancil's apprentice to his home, where they attempted to rescue the kidnapped cat child .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Conner claimed Memnon to have the best organized beggar's guild in Faerûn , with very strict rates. According to hm, they'd charge for any service, even helping someone up if they'd fallen, and just to spit-polish a sword was 10 copper pieces .</p>
