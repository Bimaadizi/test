<p>The city walls of Qudra in north Zakhara were a prominent fortification and a marvel of engineering.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The city walls were made from granite quarried from the Furrowed Mountains . They measured 40 feet (12 meters) tall and a staggering 40 feet (12 meters) thick. The outer 20 feet (6.1 meters) of the wall was solid stone, and a 15 feet (4.6 meters) wide tunnel behind that allowed for the movement of the mamluks . A trio of fortified gates, all facing the mountains, breached the wall. The wall curved to surround the harbor along the coast of the Great Sea and was dominated by 50 feet (15 meters) towers at each end that monitored the waters. A great chain could be hoisted between the two towers to block the harbor from any naval attacks.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Mamluks of the various mamluk organizations took turns patrolling the walls on a monthly basis. Large cauldrons of everburning oil were positioned at strategic points along the wall, ready to be dumped onto any unfortunate invaders at a moment's notice.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of 1367 DR , the walls had never been breached.</p>
