<p>The Troll Mountains , also called the Trollcrag Mountains , was a small mountain range in the Vast in north Faerûn , running north of the River Vesper from the Dragon Reach in the west to the Earthspur Mountains in the east.</p>
<h2>Geographical Features</h2>
<p>The Troll Mountains were an arm of the greater Earthspur Mountains.</p>
<p>They held two major passes, Viperstongue and Three Trees Pass . Viperstongue in the west was a low saddle valley through which ran the Cross Road . In the east, Three Trees Pass was a long cleft between the Troll Mountains and the Earthspur or Giantspike Mountains , along which the North Road ran.</p>
<p>The mountains were riddled with old dwarven mine tunnels.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>As the name said, trolls once hunted the slopes and valleys of the range, but they were nearly wiped out by the dwarves , leaving few trolls by 1370 DR . The dwarves made their homes in mines in high mountains by Three Trees Pass.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The dwarven mines of the Troll Mountains were at one time rich in iron and copper , but these were thoroughly worked out by 1370 DR, producing very little metal. The disused passages were overrun by monsters.</p>
