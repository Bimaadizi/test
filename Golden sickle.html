<p>A golden sickle was a magical sickle that originated from the Moonshae Isles and were recreated on the Sword Coast North in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>In combat, it could be wielded as a sickle with a +2 enchantment that made the weapon 's slashes more deadly and guided the wielder's hand towards the target. There also existed three other variants of the golden sickles , each possessing a +1 , +2 , and +8 enchantments. All these copies were used by druids and allowed them to receive additional spells from their deities , the additional spells' circle of magic depended on the enchantment's strength. These sickles also granted the wielder innate ability to empathize with animals.</p>
<p>The weapon also had a limited number of charges. At the cost of one charge, the wielder could use the sickle to cast a plant door spell , with a few differences from the normal druidic version. The sylvan door or pathway always lasted ten minutes and could be used by others, not just the wielder. The path created could measure up to 120 feet (37 meters) in length.</p>
<p>At no cost in charges, the wielder was empowered to pass without trace as the druid spell provided that he or she could concentrate upon it while doing so.</p>
<p>A golden sickle could be created from an enchanted sickle and a special type of holy water .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The original golden sickle with a powerful +8 enchantment was considered to be a mere legend among druids of Faerûn until the 14 th century DR, when a number of druids left their circles and embarked on the quest to find the original artifact that inspired many weaker variants. This was caused by a rumor that claimed that the golden sickle reappeared on the Prime Material plane after it was hidden by the nature deity Chauntea many centuries before the 14 th century DR. One prophet among the druids stated that the person who would wield the golden sickle would restore balance to Faerûn.</p>
<p>A golden sickle with a simpler +1 enchantment was forged by Master Blacksmith Marrok of Shining Knight Arms and Armor shop of Neverwinter to help the heroes who sought the cure from the dreaded Wailing Death of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Later the same year, a more powerful version was created by Master Blacksmith Barun of Beorunna's Well to help the forces of Neverwinter stand against Lady Aribeth the Betrayer , who led a marching army of Luskan in the deadly but short-lived Neverwinter-Luskan war.</p>
