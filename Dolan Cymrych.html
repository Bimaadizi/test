<p>Dolan Cymrych was High King of the Moonshae Isles for a brief time in the mid–9 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was a member of the Cymrych Dynasty and the second son of his predecessor, High King Kevan . His successor was his first son, Conn Cymrych .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dolan assumed the throne of the High King in the Year of the Empty Throne, 850 DR , following the death of his father.</p>
<p>Only two years later, in the Year of the False Smile, 852 DR , a massive fleet of Illuskan longships arrived from the Sword Coast seeking to invade and settle the Moonshaes. Dolan and his son, Prince Conn, led a flotilla of coracles to meet them in Whitefish Bay , but they were hopelessly outmatched and their fleet was all but destroyed. Dolan died in that sea battle as he covered his followers' and son's retreat, and the Crown of the High King sank with him. The loss of the Crown would severely weaken the political power of his successors, who would go on to fight and ultimately concede territory to the same " Northmen " invaders over the next century.</p>
