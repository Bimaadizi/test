<p>Sixstar was one of the more luxurious neighborhoods found within the city of Ravens Bluff in the 14 th century DR . The quiet and peaceful locale was full of three-and-four-story longhouses that had housed several generations of the city's nobility . There were few businesses within Sixstar and anyone that drew weapons too loud within its streets were quickly intercepted by the City Watch and their war dogs they kenneled at the Redspires House .</p>
<p>This neighborhood of the Uptown District garnered its name from the six-way intersection of Broken Bit Lane , Fire Lane and Mac Intyre Path , a bit west of Lake Christina .</p>
