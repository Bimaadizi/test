<p>A dracolisk was a crossbreed between a dragon and a basilisk .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Dracolisks were extremely rare. They resembled a mixture of ( black ) dragons and basilisks, especially in regards to how they attacked foes. Dracolisks were dark brown, six-legged creatures.</p>
<p>Generally, these crossbreeds were not as smart as their draconic counterparts, but were more intelligent than greater basilisks. They were able to fly as fast as they could run.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>These dragon-basilisks were very stealthy, and could lie in wait for the right time to initiate combat.</p>
<p>Dracolisks made very tough foes. They made use of both the breath weapon of a dragon and the petrifying gaze of a basilisk. Dracolisks could also lash out with their strong arms, claws, and ferocious teeth. Their acidic breath had a range of 30 ft (9.1 m) and they could gaze at their foes from up to 20 ft (6.1 m) away.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was written in ancient texts that dracolisks were a distinct species and potentially more common at such a time.</p>
<p>Though very rare, a fiendish male dracolisk (half–black dragon/half–basilisk) stalked the Underdark of Toril circa the 14 th century DR . The powerful and bad-tempered being survived alone in the Underdark for decades, and preyed on rothé and drow . It also had the ability to smite good -aligned creatures, and was immune to acid, being put to sleep, or being paralyzed.</p>
<p>A few taverns and inns around Faerûn were named after the deadly dragon-like creatures, such as the Dracolisk's Head in Calaunt , and the Dancing Dracolisk in Arabel , Cormyr .</p>
