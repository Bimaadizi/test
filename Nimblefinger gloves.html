<p>Nimblefinger gloves were enchanted gloves that boosted the wearer's finger dexterity and fortified their sleight of hand skills.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nimblefinger gloves were crafted out of the softest finest doe leather that offered warmth and protection to the wearer. The gloves were designed specifically to fit a gnomish hand perfectly so that they felt like the wearer's second skin.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Any creature who wore the gloves had their sleight of hand skills slightly boosted, however, small folk, like hin or dwarves also had their overall dexterity slightly boosted, while gnomes received both boons with their overall dexterity boosted even further.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
