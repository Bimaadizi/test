<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Chardalyn dragons were constructs built with chardalyn , a rare gem . Their wings were made from a strong, rubber-like substance.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Because of the demonic energy infusing it, a chardalyn dragon was a malevolent creature who relished in the suffering of others.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Chardalyn dragons were powerful constructs. These constructs were immune to damage from the cold and poisoning. They had significant natural magical resistance and were immune to fear and to paralyzing and petrifying effects and spells. Any spell that attempted to change a chardalyn dragon's form or structure failed. Chardalyn dragons emitted a powerful charm-like aura. Any sentient creature within 30 ft (9.1 m) of the construct was vulnerable to this charm-like effect.</p>
