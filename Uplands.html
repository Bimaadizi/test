<p>The Uplands was a sparsely populated stretch of farmlands in the realm of Impiltur , located east of the Earthfast Mountains and north of the much more populated region known as the Easting Coast .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Uplands contained a few large towns and small cities but was most noted for its numerous farming communities known as "thaedars". These collectives saw a number of small farms banding together for mutual protection, easier transportation of goods and a greater shared labor force during the harvest months. Among the most successful and well-known of these groups included the Red Ram , Silver Plough and Three Horns thaedars.</p>
<p>The miners and other laborers of the Uplands led hard lives that often led to heavy drinking rowdy behavior. While this behavior was seldom tolerated, these hard-working folk earned the nation significant wealth, and were a granted a fair amount of leeway by otherwise austere Impilturan constabulary .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before the Great Glacier receded from northeastern Faerûn the Uplands were dominated by the great hobgoblin realm of Haekrukkha .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>A number of Triadic monasteries and abbeys were located in the Uplands.</p>
