<p>Marikke was a Ffolk priestess of Chauntea from Alaron in the Moonshae Isles prior to her death in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Her hair was long, stiff, and yellow, and would hang down over her face as she prayed.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was devoted to her goddess, and took comfort in her presence. She gladly recited long litanies of prayers—the nineteen formal prayers and twenty-one codicils —despite how time-consuming and exhausting this could be. She was interested in the ways that the gods interacted or related to each other, and had privately entertained the thought that all gods might just be extensions of one singular divinity.</p>
<p>She liked to have her own personal space.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Marikke's Chauntea-given powers allowed her to heal others, to heighten her allies' skills, and to grant speed and good fortune on the high seas.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She assumed the role of adoptive mother to Kip , an orphaned cat-shifter from Alaron . She loved him very deeply, and the thought of losing him brought her great grief.</p>
<p>Marikke was one of the newest members of the crew of the Sphinx , and helped to tend the sails and pray for good winds. She was indebted to the ship's captain, Lukas , for helping her out of a desperate situation. She distrusted the Savage , in part because she distrusted all elves (whom she saw as arrogant), and she was in turn distrusted by Suka .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Marikke was born in an upland village on Alaron. She trained as a priestess of Chaunte, and became well-versed in the stories of various gods. At some point, she adopted the starving Kip and provided him with a home at her father's house.</p>
<p>One spring in the late 1470s DR, Marikke left Kip at an inn she could not afford as she desperately sought work and a guildhall in Caer Callidyrr . This was when she met Lukas, who recruited her as a healer for an upcoming job after he learned of her and Kip's plight.</p>
<p>The job in question was to escort Lord Aldon Kendrick to the ruins of Caer Corwell in Sarifal , but the Sphinx was greeted there by High Lady Ordalf , the ruler of Sarifal, who killed Aldon and tasked the crew with killing her half-sister, Lady Amaranth , who led a group of lycanthropes on the island of Moray . During these interactions, the High Lady Ordalf expressed her disdain for Kip and mocked Marikke for being a woman aboard a ship of mostly males. Unbeknownst to the crew, Ordalf had determined during their meeting that Marikke and Kip were the keys to fulfilling a prophecy for the return of Malar , a "dead" god worshiped by the Black Blood tribe on Moray. Thinking that she would not mind if Malar were to arise and kill Amaranth instead of the crew of the Sphinx , Ordalf contacted Argon Bael , a Malarite angel of vengeance , and coordinated signals to let him know that they were coming to Moray. When the Sphinx was sunk by fire nagas , Marikke, Kip, and the Savage were ambushed and captured by Argon Bael and his followers upon reaching Moray's shore.</p>
<p>The hostages were taken to the city below Scourtop and into Malar's tomb , where Argon Bael revealed that both Marikke and Kip were needed for the success of the ritual to revive his god. He told Marikke that her goddess's affirmation was required to raise Malar from death, and while Marikke could not believe this, it was confirmed by Chauntea herself in a vision granted to Marikke as she was subjected to torture meant to compel Kip to give himself as the vessel for Malar's return. Already confused and afraid that her goddess would desire the return of an evil god at the expense of her and Kip, Marikke became despondent when the Savage attempted to intervene and stop the ritual, and was revealed to be a hated daemonfey . When the dust settled, Argon Bael was dead, the Savage had been captured again, and Kip had become an aspect of Malar. Afraid of both her goddess and of the Savage, Marikke clung to the hope that Kip's personality would resurface, and became a servant of Malar.</p>
<p>Only a couple days later, she finally confronted the Savage, whom "Kip" had ordered her to kill, and while she found him to be irredeemable, she was stung by his accusations of betrayal and decided to help him escape. She confronted "Kip" and tried to remind him of his old self, but Malar lost patience with her. His werewolves dismembered her body and burned its pieces on his altar. Chauntea did not approve of this treatment of her priestess, and turned against Malar when he tried to conquer Moray the following day.</p>
