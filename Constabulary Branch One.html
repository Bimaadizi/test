<p>Constabulary Branch One was the first of the three major watch headquarters of the Eileanar enclave of Netheril , alongside Branch Two and Branch Three .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The building was found on the northern rim of the enclave, handling the crimes in that region.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The ground floor of the building was partially publicly accessible, with three receptionists who handled and guided visitors. A large room behind the reception area held the desks, comfy chairs, filing cabinets, and crystal balls of twenty low-ranking constables who worked there when they weren't out patrolling the streets.</p>
<p>The cellar level was made up of an expansive maze of 200 jail cells, with the entire level impossible to magically enter or exit, and causing incredibly dangerous backlash effects against teleportation magic.</p>
<p>The upper level of the structure was home to the offices of the highest-ranking constables and commissioners who reported directly to Karsus and his trusted followers such as Andoris Derathar . The Chief of Constables Zacharia was assisted by the loyal and dutiful Underchiefs Chanteclaire , Chantonay , and Flamininus . Chantonay was responsible for protecting the building via magical and quasimagical items , spells, and other magical effects, while Flamininus performed divinations and similar augury magics, using them to locate criminals and verify personal accounts during interviews and court proceedings.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The jail level of the building was extremely heavily warded against intrusion, thanks to one of Chatonay's friends weaving a complex web of magical defenses. Magical infiltration was impossible, and teleportation was potentially subject to extreme backlash:</p>
