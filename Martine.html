<p>Martine was a Harper ranger famous for defeating the gelugon Vreesar .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Martine was a short and petite woman (only five feet tall) with short black hair and long bangs across her forehead. Her eyes were dark blue. She had a deep scar across her back. After her battles in the Samek Valley , Martine walked somewhat stiffly.</p>
<p>She tended to dress in buckskin clothing and wore a fur half-cape. In combat, she armored herself with elven chainmail and a small helmet.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Martine carried a knife, a magic dagger , which she received from the wizard Jazrac , and a magic longsword , which she acquired from her friend Vilheim . She had a bow, and wore a wicker backpack made for her by gnomes . In the pack, she stored a blanket , extra clothing, and Smerznik's Super Satchel , which was similar to a bag of holding . She owned four beads of force and a jar of Keoghtom's ointment and of course her Harper pin .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Martine, until her mission in the Samek Valley , was afraid of failure, but during that adventure, she learned her limits and accepted them. Martine had a very strong sense of duty to the Harpers and, during a mission, tried to avoid all distractions; however, she was a very curious and nervous individual, always in movement in open spaces.</p>
<p>Martine was somewhat of a tomboy and was particularly attracted to older men.</p>
<p>She was a devotee of Tymora from her youth, but her friend Vilheim introduced her to Torm 's dogmas. She also payed homage to Mielikki and Lliira .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Beyond the skills of an expert ranger, Martine also knew how to ride hippogriffs and could speak Gnoll . She was highly proficient with dagger, longsword, and shortbow.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Martine was born in Sembia from loving parents. In her teens, she left home for a life of adventure on the Sea of Fallen Stars . There, she defeated a pirate lord and acquired her first magic sword, "Sea Dog", but the battle left her with a scar on her back.</p>
<p>Eventually, Martine acquired a hippogriff mount and met the wizard Jazrac of Saerloon , who enlisted her in the Harpers . Martine performed for him a series of small, simple missions until — as detailed in the novel Soldiers of Ice — Jazrac sent her to the frozen Samek valley , north of Damara, to close a dangerous portal to the Para-Elemental Plane of Ice .</p>
<p>Upon arrival, Martine requested the help of local gnomes (the Vani) but only the hermit Vilheim , a former paladin of Torm, agreed to guide her. During their ensuing adventure on the Great Glacier and up and down the Samek valley, Martine, with the aid of Vilheim, the gnome warrior Jouka , her mentor Jazrac, and the gnoll shaman Krote , closed the portal and then fought the Burnt Fur gnoll tribe led by the trapped ice devil Vreesar . In the final battle, thanks to the sacrifice of Vilheim, Vreesar was destroyed and the portal closed for good.</p>
<p>After that adventure, Martine decided to travel with Krote. After attending to a Harper mission in Mulmaster, most of their time was spent in Shadowdale , Sembia, or around the Sea of Fallen Stars.</p>
