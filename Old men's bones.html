<p>Old men's bones was a classic game played in Faer√ªn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>An old men's bones set consisted of tiny bones that were poured into a pile. The object of the game was to remove the bones one at a time from the pile without disturbing the other bones in the pile.</p>
<p>Cheaper sets were made from the bones of birds; however, sets constructed from the slivered bones of wyverns , dragons , or other dangerous creatures also existed. Aurora's Emporium promised that none of their sets were made from the bones of sentient humanoids .</p>
<p>The bones were usually stored in a leather or metal tube canister.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The game originated in Phlan and the Moonsea region.</p>
