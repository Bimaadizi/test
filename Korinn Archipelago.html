<p>The Korinn Archipelago was a chain of islands in the Sea of Swords , situated in the northernmost region of the Moonshae Isles . Sailing along the archipelago was sometimes known as going down the Korinn Run .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Korinn Archipelago stood west of Delmarin Island , as well as east of both the island of Ruathym and the small archipelago known as the Whalebones . Beneath the water between those latter two locales, it laid close to the storm giant fortress of Maelstrom .</p>
<p>The archipelago consisted of dozens of small, windswept islands. By and large, all of these isles were rocky and hilly or mountainous, with only a few good fields suitable for farming. Although some of them were wooded with a hardy breed of pine , most of the isles were either barren moors, tundras, or simple bedrock.</p>
<p>A number of the small islands in this archipelago featured underwater caves, unknown to those on the surface. Within those caves stood temples long forgotten about.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>Dragon turtles were known to prowl around the waters of Korinn. Many of its islands were inhabited by dragons , griffons , harpies , and wyverns . Domesticated animals on the islands included goats , pigs , and sheep . At least one of the islands were stocked with hardy goats by the bronze dragon Nymmurh , whom would leave his lair on Alaron to feed upon.</p>
<p>Island of Viledel in particular was known to have a myriad of mundane sea birds, wild goats in its western hills, and rats . In addition, a variety of edible wild plants grew on the island that included onions .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Primary exports of the Korinn Archipelago's islands included fish , pork, mutton, leather, linen , wool, timber, and raspberries . As well as a myriad of wild herbs and spices . The larger islands and greater port cities also had many craftsmen, who provided luxury goods and services. Some of the islands also operated salt mines.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa -10500 DR , the Korinn Archipelago took form.</p>
<p>Around roughly 1128 DR , the Korinn Archipelago was discovered by human farmers and fishermen emigrating into the Moonshae Isles region. These settlers lived a rough and lawless life, lacking trade as well as any sort of central leadership.</p>
<p>Over the course of a century they became firmly settled on its islands and their population. With this came increased trade and attention from pirates. Between 1188 DR and 1228 DR , strong bands of pirates terrorized the waters of Korinn, holding great sway over its people.</p>
<p>Around that latter date, a Northmen chieftain named Viledel led a large fleet of his human and demihuman followers into the archipelago from their southern kingdom of Petathal . They sought to colonize the lands themselves, aspiring to one day create a strong maritime empire. They set up a base on the westernmost island, which came to be named after him. Over the next four decades, through a combination of clever tactics and skill in sailing that surpassed them, his people managed to diminish the power and presence of the once supreme pirate forces. Sending them scattering out north and south from the Moonshae Isles.</p>
<p>Over the course of those forty years Viledel's people also came to mix peacefully with the island's already settled humans, over time bringing more islands under the chieftain's control and establishing more trade routes. His kingdom thrived and the people lived in a time of relative peace. But on 1268 DR , the fortieth year of Viladel's reign, a kingdom of pirates launched a retaliatory attack. They quickly overran his island and rampaged throughout it, destroying nearly the whole population.</p>
<p>One of the island's inhabitants, a man named Keestake , avoided the notice of the pirates by hiding under an overturned boat. He continued to live solitarily on the island for the following sixty years, guarding the treasure of his fallen king and surviving off the land, eating rats and wild plants like onions.</p>
<p>Having lost their king, the islands became fragmented and the weakest fell victim to stronger forces. The pirates went on to grasp dominion over the western islands of the archipelago and cut them off from trade routes so thoroughly that knowledge of their location was lost to much of the Realms. In sixty years following the death of their king the independently governed islands came to thrive once more to some degree, cooperating in manners of trade and growing their populations.</p>
<p>Circa 1328 DR , a group of archipelago inhabitants that included the merchant Melkeras 's daughter, Melisana of Ventris were captured by slavers and sent sailing towards the pirate stronghold of Westhaven when a violent storm sent most of the galley 's crew overboard. Eventually they crashed upon the shores of Viledel Isle and the group of people managed to escape their jailor, a drunken half-orc named Hafkris .</p>
<p>Making their way over some low hills on the western side of the cove they had crashed in, this group soon came upon a dozen goblins and a half-dozen orcs fighting in a ravine — members of the Sithisila Fleet and Hak-kubra tribe respectively. After defeating these groups by uncertain means, this party hurried into the ravine to the side of the elderly Keestake. He informed them of his backstory and reason for the two buccaneering groups' conflict — the Hak-kubra had arrived a few days earlier and captured him, seeking the treasure, then the Sithisila Fleet arrived two days prior and since then been fighting over the rights of Viledel's fabled treasure. The group then went to the Temple of the Goddess , where they learned that Viledel's patron goddess had created the storm that surrounds the island after the Hak-kubra vandalized her temple and in further retaliation was planning to destroy the entirety of Viledel Isle.</p>
<p>Around the early 14 th century DR , Elminster sailed up from the Moonshae Isles and through the archipelago upon a longship captained by King Rolf Olafson . The whole time sailing through them, the king and his Northmen crew were very tense and vigilant, for they were concerned of the possibility of getting attacked by the local pirates.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>One of the flying cities of the Netheril empire that fell from Karsus's Folly were believed to have landed in the waters of the archipelago.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The inhabitants of these islands were primarily made up of Northmen, many of whom were shepherd or fishers but would occasionally arm themselves to go pirating or raiding. They lived alongside a variety of non-humans descended from the followers of Viledel, which included dwarves , elves , gnomes , half-elves , and halflings . Some remnants of the Ffolk were also known to inhabit the isles.</p>
<p>The isles' dozens of small settlements were each ruled as mini-kingdoms, and were unified by little other than their shared Northlander culture. Outsiders were not generally welcome: this was particularly true of those who were not of Northlander descent, but even Northlanders found little neutral ground outside the port of Westhaven.</p>
<p>The white dragon Arveiaturace was known to sometimes hunt in the archipelago.</p>
