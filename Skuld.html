<p>Skuld was located on the coast of the Alamber Sea . Prior to the Spellplague , Skuld was the capital city of the nation of Mulhorand . The City of Eternity , as it was also known, was claimed to be the oldest inhabited settlement in Faerûn , and, before its destruction, was certainly the largest. The Spellplague completely destroyed Skuld, burying its streets and buildings in rubble.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The city of Skuld was built in approximately −2100 DR , and in that time no invading force succeeded in breaching its walls.</p>
<h2>Pre-Spellplague</h2>
<h3>Geography</h3>
<p>The city of Skuld was surrounded by defensive battlements that, until the Spellplague, remained intact for over 35 centuries, though slave quarters existed outside this barrier, extending from the eastern gate. The city was divided into a number of districts, separated from one another by additional walls.</p>
<h3>City Catacombs</h3>
<p>The temple of Osiris could be found between the merchant and warehouse districts. Built along the southern wall of the city, this temple served as the only official entrance to Skuld's catacombs. This subterranean network was known to be home to untold monsters, including notable populations of werecrocodiles and rakshasas .</p>
<h3>Government</h3>
<p>Though officially governed by the vizier, the day to day activities of Skuld were actually administered by members of the church of Horus-Re .</p>
<h3>Military</h3>
<p>The Captain of the city guard was traditionally selected by the clergy of the church of Anhur , but recent [ as of when? ] shifts in power allowed priests of Horus-Re to place a member of their clergy in this position. The guard itself was composed almost entirely of mercenaries from the nation of Chessenta , though adventurers would occasionally be granted guard positions.</p>
<h3>Law</h3>
<p>Foreigners could not possess weapons or armor within Skuld, and the use of magic by these individuals was strictly prohibited. Chessentan mercenaries employed in the city guard were also required to abide by these laws, though guard members were able to purchase special permits allowing them to bypass the restrictions. Elves , halflings , and gnomes were denied entrance into the city unless their presence was pre-approved by city or church officials.</p>
<p>Capital punishment for severe crimes was common in Skuld, with public beheading being the favored form of execution. Another common form of retribution for crimes was banishment.</p>
