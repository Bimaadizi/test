<p>The Warblade , also known as the Noble Warrior's Blade , or Ary'Velahr'Kerym in Elven , was one of three elfblades created in ancient Cormanthyr to help the elves establish a ruling family. The Warblade was used to name the Arms-Major , the Defender by Arm, as the wielder was called. The bearer of the Warblade was responsible for the primary armed forces of the realm at large, known as the Akh'Velahr .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Warblade was created by Elven High Magic alongside its mates, the Artblade and the Rulers' Blade in −4000 DR , at the behest of the ill Coronal of Jhyrennstar , Oacenth , who desired the magical swords to determine the rulers of the united tribes and the new nation of Cormanthyr.</p>
<p>Later, in the Year of Shadows Fleeting, −331 DR , Lord Orym Hawksong fell in battle at the siege of the Twisted Tower , but not before the Warblade suddenly sprang up and defended him for a time, before being paralyzed by drow magics. The body of the hero and the blade were stolen into the darkness, thereafter sought by more than a hundred elves fruitlessly. After its loss, the Arms-Majors instead wielded Moonblades or one of the six Baneblades created by the human wizard Demron .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Flame Tongue, 500 DR , the elven noble and bladesinger Josidiah Starym embarked on a famous quest to retrieve the Warblade from the Twisted Tower with a band of his adventuring friends. He returned in the Year of the Nomad, 674 DR not with the Warblade , but with the Artblade instead.</p>
<p>For a time, the Warblade was rumored to be in a secret vault beneath a temple of Lolth in the ruins of Maerimydra , in the Underdark . However, near the end of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the elf Ilsevele Miritar was alerted by ancient wards that the Warblade had surfaced to the Realms Above, somewhere near the Twisted Tower.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Warblade , like others of its type, shared some common characteristics with its kin, the other elfblades , but also had its own special powers.</p>
<p>One of those powers slowed the aging process of its wielder by a half. So for every two years that passed, its wielder would only age one.</p>
<p>This sword constantly shone like silver and remained perfectly reflective despite use. The sword and its hilt (as well as the wielder's hand) were constantly bathed in blue and silver harmless flames. Visible at the seat of the blade was an elven rune meaning " weapon ". The wielder could gain a bull's strength three times per day and detect evil and detect good at will. After completing a blade-dance ritual, the wielder was able to summon a dynamic blade barrier . However, if they failed the Blade-rite, the wielder's hand would clench the sword with extreme strength, causing them much pain and leaving deep palm scars. If the wielder was a N'Tel'Quess (non-elf or drow) or of evil nature, the sword became a dancing sword and attacked the wielder for upwards of an hour, attempting to slay them.</p>
