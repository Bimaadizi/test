<p>Pang was a monk of the Way of Enlightenment at Pokarr Gompa in Tabot around Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He introduced himself as a "nu cho" of the Pokarr monastery, where he worked as a scribe. Being a scribe, he took a vow of silence.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Pang was a young man, and as such was certain in his beliefs and biases alike. He favored northern Tabot over southern and the monasteries over the secular settlements. He had some vehemently held views on Shou Lung's government and expansion.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>On pilgrimage, he wore an orange loincloth and carried an ornate green and gold umbrella.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 2607, Abbot Mo Kin chose Pang to represent Pokarr Gompa in the great festival at the Temple of Heaven's Heart on Mount E'kwong , releasing him from an eight-year-long vow of silence in the process. The grateful Pang later described him as his benefactor and "the wisest of all abbots". Pang was accompanied by five temple guards. While on the pilgrimage , he introduced himself to a representative from Shou Lung —in truth, the Dragon Lord Mei Lung —on the grounds that he looked "important enough" and asked to walk with him up the mountain. On the way, Pang told him much about Tabot, albeit biased and incompletely, particularly when it came to the south and the common folk. Regardless, Mei Lung later related Pang's account of Tabot to Elminster .</p>
