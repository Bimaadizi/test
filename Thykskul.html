<p>Thykskul was a dimwitted barbarian that lived in the Kingdom of Mertwig around the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When King Mertwig was on the verge of death at age 65, various fortune hunters and individuals claiming to be his long-lost heirs scoured his kingdom in search of wealth and treasure. During their journey to claim the throne, the would-be heirs of King Mertwig met Thykskul and hired him for 18 gold pieces to join them on their adventure. However, some took advantage of the barbarian's deficient intellect and managed to convince him to be their hireling for a mere 9 gp.</p>
