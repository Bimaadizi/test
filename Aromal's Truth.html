<p>Aromal's Truth was a powerful enchanted rapier that once belonged to the man named Aromal some years before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This weapon possessed a powerful +5 enchantment was made its attacks devastating and guided the wielder's arm toward the target. Additionally, its magics specifically were useful in dealing with human enemies, dramatically improving the wielder's defense. Aromal's Truth also gave the wielder the skill of improved evasion and granted the effects of the freedom of movement spell as long as they held the raider.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Aromal lived sometime before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR and was known for his sharp tongue rather than his sharp sword. He could easily charm the wealthy out of their money with a story and was accompanied by several fellow conmen nearly as talented as Aromal. He was a terrible fighter, however, and feared his luck would run out one day. It was uncannily fortuitous that one day Aromal "discovered" the rapier that could help him in this.</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the weapon fell into he hands of Mother Feodorra , a charm and magic item peddler from the Rashemi city of Mulsantir .</p>
