<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jacinth Moonspring worked for the editor-in-chief Fred Faber . The new editor provided the readers of the Trumpeter with a monthly scoop, gossip, and news from the Living City's cream of the crop. In the very first column, Jackie reported on the Lord Mayor Charles Oliver O'Kane and his love triangle that originated several years prior. Apart from the politician, the love triangle included the beauty named Allandra Mystallan and a wildmage of the Bluff, Belanor Fenmarel , during the mage's announcement of a mayoral electoral campaign. Reportedly, Allandra was seen holding hands with the Lord Mayor just a month later at the Ravens Bluff Bazaar . Just four months later, Jacinth reported on the tragedy that shook the gala that took place during the Winter Festival . The gala was dedicated to the wedding of Lord Charles Blacktree IV and Lady Katherine Marie Moorland , during which Jacinth Moonspring was sitting in the front row. The gala was interrupted by an unnamed guardsman who rushed into the hall with the dire news of a Zhentish attack on Ravens Bluff. Three months later, Jacinth's column reported on Don Juan Montery , a notorious Golden Rooster knight philanderer.</p>
