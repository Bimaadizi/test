<h2>Legends & Rumors</h2>
<p>In 1246 DR , Elminster Aumar judged that the Simbul 's slaying of mages, whether from Thay or not, had become excessive, and the feats of her power were tilting the balance of power around Aglarond . Amongst other mages slain, he counted Ilbrul the Ramshorn, who claimed to hail from Netheril , as he recalled.</p>
