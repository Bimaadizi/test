<p>Elixirs of halfling luck were potions created through sanguinous magic arts by Araj Oblodra of Crimson Draughts in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Elixirs of halfling luck were distilled from the blood of hin , allowing the imbiber to adopt their racial abilities and properties. Once such a potion was consumed, it gifted the imbiber with halfling luck – the ability to be lucky, having the upper hand in all non-combat situations. The smallfolk luck lost its blood-bound magic one day after being imbibed.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Araj Oblodra, an alchemist and a Blood Vendor, was using the blood of halflings infected with the illithid tadpoles of the Cult of the Absolute to craft these potions during her stay with the cult in Moonrise Towers . After the death of Ketheric Thorm , she returned to the Crimson Draughts – her apothecary in the city of Baldur's Gate , where she resumed her sanguinous magic experiments.</p>
