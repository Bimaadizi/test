<p>Sakrattars Irithyl was second Coronal of Cormanthyr from −2900 DR to −1950 DR , the youngest great-grandson of Kahvoerm Irithyl , first Coronal. He became the ruler of the empire after his father's death and the unsuccessful blade draw of Divisav Irithyl , Kahvoerm's first son. His reign ended with his death as he sacrificed himself to create a blood dragon that slew a horde of drow that had occupied the former realm of Uvaeren and the Twisted Tower .</p>
<p>Sakrattars' rysar was plagued with the rising of the Twisted Tower in −2549 DR despite repeated attacks on it by the Coronal's forces. He also lived to see the infamous Spiderfires, which burned acres and acres of woods and separated Rystall Wood from the main body of Cormanthor .</p>
