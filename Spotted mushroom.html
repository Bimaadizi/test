<p>Spotted mushroom was a species of fungus used in cooking on the Sword Coast North , gathered in Neverwinter Wood , notable for its taste and red cap.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , Jingo Rummage , a halfling adventurer , gathered forest herbs in Neverwinter Wood when his companion Jodri was eaten by wild wolf-men. As revenge, Jingo asked a group of Neverwintran adventurers to gather umber leaves , spotted mushrooms, and spiceroot , to add them to the wolves' cooking pots. The aroma attracted hungry ogres to the camp, who, in turn, slaughtered the beast-men.</p>
