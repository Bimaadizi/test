<p>East of the kingdom of Ulgarth , in the northern Utter East of the far southeast Faerûn lay barbarian-inhabited lands .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The land was a vast plain, uncharted by the neighboring civilizations. In the west, by the border with Ulgarth, lay Barbarians' Road . In the southwest corner was the Stony Waste . A river ran across the far eastern side, and the plains abutted the A-Ling Shan , part of the great Yehimal , in the east and the first range crossing the Utter East in the south.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The land was inhabited by a horse -riding barbarian people.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>In the 14th century DR . the folk of Ulgarth knew the people of this land as "the Horde", as barbarians to the east who regularly gathered in great hosts to raid their settlements. The kingdom was vigilant, well-prepared, and even paranoid in defending itself. Convict armies regularly patrolled the eastern borders. Nevertheless, the people of the city of Kaspar preferred to trade with them, though guardedly, and took the pick of their horses after a raid.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Maelin Rascalin , once a notorious bandit turned a convict soldier, became one of the greatest generals of Ulgarth's history by repeating hurling back invading armies of Horde barbarians. After successfully defending against a 1000-strong host, he was granted the barony of Suormpar ; his grandson was baron by 1367 DR .</p>
