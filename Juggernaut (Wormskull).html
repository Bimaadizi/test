<p>The Juggernaut , called "destroyer of nations" and a "doomsday machine", was a powerful living construct built by the mad inventor Wormskull the Artificer and brought to life by the Pearl of Power in Konigheim in the Utter East during the time of the Bloodforge Wars ( 648 â€“ 657 DR ).</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was a large tank-like machine constructed of wood and steel that moved along a single massive wooden roller studded with spikes. One arm was a fully functioning flame thrower, and the other was an extendable spinning three-bladed disc that cut like a buzz-saw. Its top and back were covered with spiked armor plating, colored tan with brown spikes on one side (with the flame-thrower) and blue with tan spikes on the other side (with buzz-saw), with steel plates down the spine. A fanged skull-face on the front completed the fearsome aspect, and occasionally belched smoke.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>The Juggernaut was described as both device and beast, and it was relentless. It attacked everything around it, creatures and structures alike.</p>
<h2>Combat & Powers</h2>
<p>It was a powerful and robust combatant. While it moved slowly, its flamethrower could hurl balls of flame that ignited spaces ahead of it. Its buzz-saw sliced through anything that had to get close, and it could simply roll over and crush what couldn't fly away. It was immune to spells and fire , and damage to it could be repaired. The Pearl of Power was installed within its innards.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Wormskull and Garrulos , a pair of feuding, treasure-hunting brothers, delved into an ancient barrow tomb and uncovered the Pearl of Power. Legend held that it could make arcane inventions come alive, but that it had a curse that greed would give rise to war and disaster. Garrulos immediately snatched it for himself, cheating his artificer brother of the glory, and took it to Konigheim to present it to the king. This act triggered the Nuts and !Bolts ( sic ) conflict.</p>
