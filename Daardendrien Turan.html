<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Turan was the father of the Thymari hero Daardendrien Medrash and of Nijana .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1486 DR , Turan was determining whether to appoint his son, Medrash, as a candidate for the title of Vanquisher or if he should look for a better candidate. While Medrash was a war hero of the invasion of 1479 DR and had won fame in foreign courts since, he was also a god worshiper, something that would lessen his chances to win the elections.</p>
<p>After Kepeshkmolik Tarhun was killed in the wake of the Second Sundering and the First Tymanther-Unther War , Turan was one of the elders who voted for Yrjixtilex Kallan as the next Vanquisher. He also gave his support to Kepeshkmolik Dumuzi when he petitioned the elders to give official support to the rites of Enlil .</p>
