<p>Matasuuri Unteki was the daimyo of Iiso in Wa around 1357 DR and the younger brother of the shogun .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Unteki was one of the Three House daimyos and thus one of the most powerful men in Wa. Unteki was also one of the most hated. He was known in all Wa for his crazed edicts, like one for honoring the death of his dog. However, the land prospered thanks to the bureaucrats sent by Matasuuri Nagahide to serve in Unteki's administration. Unteki allowed them to control public affairs, as he was too busy producing and performing in kabuki and noh plays.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Unteki was shaggy-haired, pencil-thin, neurotic, pompous, greedy, and ruthless. His politics were driven by paranoia rather than reason. Unteki was prone to wild mood swings; the song of a child could sent him into giggling ecstasy; the sight of a dead fly could reduce him to sobbing despair. For his part, Unteki considered himself an artistic type.</p>
