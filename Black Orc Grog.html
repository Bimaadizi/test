<p>Black Orc Grog was a strong intoxicating brew distilled by some orcish tribes of the Delimbiyr Vale .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This dark, almost pitch-black beer was aggressively bitter and unpalatable to most non-orcs. Its sinister appearance and bitter taste made most folk think that Black Orc Grog was, indeed, an evil brew.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Black Orc Grog was concocted by orcs who were enrolled in an army of the Gorgomorz – Daggerford 's devil adversary. In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Gorgomorz's army was hidden in caverns not far from the Wild Pastures to the west of the hamlet of Liam's Hold .</p>
