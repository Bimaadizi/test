<p>Harmon was the cobbler of an unnamed village in Faerûn in the mid–14 th century DR and the husband of Celia .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Together, they took in Marrec as an infant, though they had many children of their own, including Emmon , and they nursed the young boy back to health. They were not able to find out who his parents were. They frowned on him taking any pet more dangerous than a hare. When Emmon was injured while on a trek through the wilderness with an eleven-year old Marrec, they punished both children. They were both supportive of Marrec's decision to join the village militia at the age of sixteen, seeing him as a natural for combat.</p>
<p>However, when Emmon was killed in the militia, and Marrec came into his medusa heritage, they wanted nothing more to do with him.</p>
