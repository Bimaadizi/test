<p>Game Set of Mujibar the Foolish was a card game from the city of Calimport in the nation of Calimshan , created sometime before 1298 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The game of Mujibar the Foolish was played with a deck of ninety cards, all stamped with numbers 1 through 9 on ten cards each. The rules were simple. Each player rolled two dice and pulled the number of cards from the deck indicated by the number on both dice. The player with the lowest sum from the card numbers won.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The game was popularized by a legendary game of cards that took place in the Year of the Pointed Bone, 1298 DR between a thief named Mujibar , deep in debt to shady criminal organizations, and a wealthy dao merchant named Khan Zohrin-Ka . The djinn offered Mujibar a gamble: a simple card game of chance. If Mujibar won, all of his debts would be paid off. If Zohrin-Ka won, then the rogue owed the djinn his soul.</p>
<p>Khan Zohrin-Ka went first and rolled "2" on the dice. The sum of his cards was "11" from "7" and "4". Mujibar went next and rolled "10." Horrified, he carefully drew ten cards from the deck without looking at the numbers and not showing them to the dao. Yet all the cards he drew were marked with "1", making the total number "10"â€”less than that of the djinni. The djinn merchant was honor-bound to obey the deal and pay up, but that didn't mean Zohrin-Ka could not kill his opponent first for stacking the deck. Mujibar was swiftly cut down, his pockets were filled with the winning money, and his body was deposited in a dark alley in Calimport .</p>
<p>Three days later, the rogue's body remained in the alley, but the gold was all gone. Instead, the coins were replaced by thousands of empty ale bottles, remnants of a party of legendary proportions, still told by Calimport's drunks well into the late 14 th century DR . Poor drunks of Calimshan were hopeful for another Mujibar the Foolish.</p>
<p>The original deck used in the faithful game ended up in a curio collection of Mintassan the Magnificent, a planeswalking mage merchant from Westgate in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR .</p>
