<p>Whisperhaunt Pass was a tunnel located in Skullport in Undermountain .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Whisperhaunt Pass was a narrow, winding tunnel with smooth, wind-sculpted walls and a steady downward slope leading toward the Upper Trade Lanes . Echoing throughout the tunnel was a constant, unsettling droning sound that resembled distant whispering, from which the pass derived its name.</p>
<p>Intermittently, a powerful blast of wind erupted from the passage, which was capable of toppling a grown human or hurling smaller creatures, such as halflings or gnomes , into the air. These gusts persisted for a short time before subsiding to a steady breeze strong enough to extinguish candles and unprotected lanterns near the entrance.</p>
<p>The source of this wind was a permanent one-way portal to the Elemental Plane of Air located 270 feet (82 meters) into the tunnel. This portal served a practical purpose, contributing to Skullport's fresh air supply. Reaching the portal was exceptionally difficult. The wind's intensity escalated with depth, and after 100 feet (30 meters), it became impossible to hear even shouted voices. Flying proved ineffective unless magical means were employed to negate the increasingly violent winds. Progress required excellent timing, proper climbing equipment, and determination.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Whisperhaunt Pass opened into the southern wall approximately 20 feet (6.1 meters) above the rooftops of the surrounding buildings.</p>
