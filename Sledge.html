<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1367 DR , sometime around the month of Alturiak , a sledge caravan that was bucking heavy snows west of Priapurl was attacked at dusk by a group of drow raiders whilst it was making its way towards a sheltered campsite. The caravan managed to fend off the drow and send them fleeing thanks to two of its members being minor wizards .</p>
<p>Around the late 14 th century DR , Ras Nsi sought to gather Chultan wood to sell to the thriving cities of the Western Heartlands . To accomplish this he had his earth elementals uproot trees, gangs of zombies load them on to sledges, and then had those pulled by dinosaurs .</p>
<p>In the 15 th century DR, the Fellowship of Carters and Coachmen , the Wheelwrights' Guild , and the Wagon-makers' and Coach Builders' Guild began working worked together to convert some drays and hire-coaches into sledges so that they could remain fully operational throughout the harshest parts of the winter season.</p>
