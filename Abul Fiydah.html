<p>Abul Fiydah was the Amir of Estanil during the midâ€“14th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As the ultimate commander of the forces stationed in Estanil, Abul was faced with the difficult task of defending the border city of Semphar .</p>
<p>Five thousand troops were at his disposal, though only 1,000 were in the city at any given time. They were stationed in the only stone building within the city.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, his most difficult challenges did not come from the goblins and elves who attacked from outside of the city, but from the Council of Loggers found within.</p>
