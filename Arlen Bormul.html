<p>Arlen Bormul was a member of the Bormul family in the late 13 th and early 14 th century DR who contributed to the collapse of the kingdom of Amn and directly caused the extinction of the Parhek dynasty.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the collapse of Amn following the assassination of King Dhanar Parhek in the Year of the Crumbling Keep, 1276 DR , Arlen took part in the intrigues and conspiracies that sought to take advantage of the chaos. His agents located a branch of the Parhek dynasty in Silverymoon , and sent assassins to take care of them in the Year of the Singing Skull, 1297 DR . The heirs Choris and Rosa were killed while Prince Rasa and Rhothar escaped, but Rohav was captured and the eight-year-old was sent to Baldur's Gate for safekeeping, and was brainwashed to believe that the assassins had actually rescued him. Rohav proved useful in tracking down his uncle Prince Malek the Coinmage , and, in the Year of the Creeping Fang, 1305 DR , Malek and his children Rhinn , Savra , and Parav were all killed. Rohav outlived his usefulness, and Arlen poisoned him to death in 1306 DR , putting an end to the Parhek family.</p>
