<p>A spelunker's lantern was a type of lantern that was strapped to the wearer's head in order to keep their hands free.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Typical spelunker's lanterns had adjustable leather headbands and consisted of a weighted bowl containing the fuel and wick . This bowl was held suspended by wooden half-circles that pivoted within each other in order to keep it always upright, regardless of the wearer's position, thereby preventing the flame from dousing or spilling. It was in many ways similar to gnomish or dwarven gyroscopes .</p>
<p>Spelunker's lanterns were available for purchase through Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue .</p>
