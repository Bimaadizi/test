<p>Akhir was a ruined city which was taken into a subdimensional bubble by Martek to serve as a test within his tomb after its inhabitants had all died. The Lancers of Death began every nightly assault on the Crypt of Al-Alisk from the city's ruins.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Sometime during the mid-to-late 3 rd century DR, the Princess of Pazar , Sithal Al-Husn , was bethrothed to Athis Al-Din of Akhir. The princess was kidnapped on her wedding night by Habrauk Al-Nirin of the Al-Alisk clan; this started a blood feud which, together with the drying of the River Athis due to the Curse of Amun-Re, ended the bloodlines of Pazar, Akhir, and the Al-Alisk clan within five generations.</p>
<p>After the end of their bloodlines, however, Akhir and the Crypt of Al-Alisk became the site of a nightly battle in which the Lancers of Death , the restless spirits of the warriors from Pazar and Akhir that perished in the conflict, emerged from the ruined city to strike at the crypt; there, they were met by the spirits of the fallen from the Al-Alisk clan.</p>
<p>Martek stole away the depopulated ruin to serve as a test sometime around the year 370 DR . In the year 1356 DR , adventurers released Princess Sithal Al-Husn, thus releasing all of the undead from their nightly combat.</p>
