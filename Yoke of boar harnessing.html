<p>A yoke of boar harnessing was a magical yoke that enabled its user to harness a pair of boars , either normal-sized or giant boars , under his or her control.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The yoke could be secured to a pair of boars to enable them to pull an object or drawn vehicle such as a chariot , plow, or cart. It was made of two pieces that could be taken apart, and each piece could be fastened to an individual boar to allow it to be ridden as a mount , again under the rider's control. If the rider was taller than a dwarf or elf then he or she could only ride giant boars.</p>
<p>The harnessed boar could also be made to perform a variety of simple tasks, even if not already trained to do so. These tasks were limited by what the animal's natural intelligence might potentially allow.</p>
