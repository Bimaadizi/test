<p>Klauth , also known as Old Snarl , was supposedly one of the eldest dragons alive who had not been turned into a dracolich .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was thoroughly evil, especially to his own kind, though he did have a few redeeming factors such as granting boons to creatures he considered no threat, crushing the odd orc horde on a whim, and the fact that he has avoided the advances of the Cult of the Dragon .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>For such an active dragon of his age, he had lived much longer than his race's life expectancy would normally allow without the aid of the Cult's methods. This was because he had developed a magical process in which he used red dragons' eggs to increase his own size, health, and vigor.</p>
<p>This also extended to the eggs of other dragons. He first made them hatch, mature them rapidly with the aid of yuan-ti priestresses to adulthood within the timespan of months. They were then sacrificed on a special altar, where an orb was used to contain the essence of the young dragon, before Klauth used the orb on himself to regain his youth.</p>
<h2>Lair</h2>
<p>Klauth had his lair in the northern Sword Coast , in a narrow winding valley dubbed Klauthen Vale in the mountains west of Mirabar . From there Old Snarl used his powerful scrying spells and abilities to learn as much as possible about the other inhabitants of the Sword Coast ; this means the old wyrm was rarely caught off guard by intruders.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was an acquaintance of Iymrith the "Desert Doom", the great blue dragon of Anauroch .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Weeping Moon, 1339 DR Klauth and the green dragon Aglaraerose devoured a horde of orcs in the Spine of the World mountains. On Mirtul 4 in 1360 DR , Klauth was waylaid by a pair of white dragons — Aerihykloarara and Ruuthundrarar —and the blue dragon Irdrithkryn , who worked in concert to kill him. Although Klauth slew each of his attackers and plundered Irdrithkryn's lair, he was gravely wounded, almost losing a wing and having half his body frozen solid. After this battle, Klauth found a new lair just west of Raven Rock to recuperate, this lair became known as Klauthen Vale.</p>
<h3>Neverwinter Nights</h3>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR Klauth took several tribes of giants under his command, with the King of the Fire Giants Scorch as their leader. They stole and took as many dragon eggs as possible from other dragons, which lived near his territory. The Hero of Neverwinter confronted him for one of the Words of Power , but realised that they couldn't possible defeat the ancient wyrm, even with the aid of their henchmen and a means of drastically weakening him. Klauth gave up the word of power for a simple errand for the hero to fullfill, namely bringing him a orb with the essence of a young dragon.</p>
<h3>Rage of Dragons</h3>
<p>Klauth succumbed to the effects of the Dracorage mythal during the Rage of Dragons in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , appearing above Mirabar full of rage with a mind set on destruction. After leveling much of the surface city he was only barely driven off by the combined efforts of Mirabar's defenders and the crystal dragon , Saryndalaghlothtor .</p>
<h3>Tyranny of Dragons</h3>
<p>When the Cult of the Dragon reemerged during the late 15 th century DR, Klauth welcomed the dragon cultists to dwell within his vale in the Spine of the North.</p>
