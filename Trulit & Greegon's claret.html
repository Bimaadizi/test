<p>Trulit & Greegon's claret was a type of red wine that was traded in the city and through Daggerford 's docks.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Trulit & Greegon's claret was the favorite wine of Purfbin Doogrick , a gnome companion of the Hero of Daggerford circa 1372 DR . During their quest to untangle many plots against the city of Daggerford, they came across numerous claret barrels in the docks. The gnome recognized the alluring aroma instantaneously and regretted that they could not "acquire" some. These barrels were traded through the docks of Daggerford via Captain Samuel Turgat 's Flyingfish .</p>
