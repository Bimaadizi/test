<p>Putrefied tumors were a type of valuable alchemical ingredients, created by the shadow magic of the Shadow-cursed Lands in the 14 th and 15 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Putrefied tumors were formed in bodies of humanoids trapped, changed, and eventually killed in the Shadow-cursed Lands, born of the dark goddess Shar 's curse . These cancerous tumors consumed internal organs, purifying them and remaining in the cursed lands long after the bodies of the afflicted rotted and withered away.</p>
<h2>Usages</h2>
<p>Putrefied tumors could be distilled into alchemical vitriol – a fetid-reeking substance with its stench being reminiscent of rotten flesh, seemingly only worsened by the alchemical processes. This foul vitriol could be mixed with several types of alchemical sublimates to create oil of bane .</p>
