<p>Giant skunks were an extra-large variety of their smaller cousins .</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>Giant skunks were capable of secreting a musk from a small posterior sac, which was heavily muscled in order to permit expulsion of the liquid. Once expelled, this fluid formed a heavy, noxious mist. This mist not only temporarily poisoned and blinded their victims, but left a lingering terrible stench. Giant skunks were immune to the nausea effect of this musk, but would still suffer blindness.</p>
<p>The stench of their musk was difficult to remove, requiring several days of washing and airing out. However, the spray would cause items made of cloth to rot away, even those of a magical nature.</p>
<p>The spray of glacier skunks was notably strong enough to immobilize a grown man, causing a stinging sensation in the eyes and a burning sensation in the throat. In some cases, it was even known to cause victims to cough up blood.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Much like their smaller cousins, when threatened a giant skunk would spray a cloud of vile musk at its opponents.</p>
<h2>Sub-Species</h2>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Basil of Lyndusfarne was capable of shapeshifting into a glacier skunk and was disguised as such on the day that Tavis Burdun first met him.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Giant skunks were omnivorous scavengers, willing to eat almost anything. Typically they ate the remains of creatures killed by larger predators. They were occasionally known to raid the camps of sentient creatures, such as humans , in search of food.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Giant skunks typically lived in forested areas. Such as the Starwood area of Cormanthor and the Plain of Standing Stones . However, glacier skunks were known to live in mountainous terrain and were rarely found anywhere else.</p>
<p>A number of giant skunks were known to serve the mad druid Wyllow within her domain of Undermountain .</p>
<h3>Relations</h3>
<p>Skunks were occasionally known to be domesticated. Some rangers were known to have them as animal companions .</p>
<h3>Usages</h3>
<p>A dead skunk with an intact posterior sac of musk was worth around 200 gold pieces to many sages and alchemists, as their musk was a very versatile component. They could be used to create smoke bombs and scrolls of stinking cloud . Beyond their musk, the meat and pelts of giant skunks were considered relatively worthless. Their flesh was bitter and required heavy seasoning to make palatable.</p>
<p>The scent glands of several giant skunks could be mixed with the blood of a green dragon in a broth to enchant its tooth .</p>
<h3>Summoning</h3>
<p>A giant skunk could be summoned by the conjure animals spell .</p>
