<p>Hlath was one of the largest and most powerful city-states in the Vilhon Reach . Sometimes the city fell under the control of Chondath .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hlath was an old walled city with streets of cobblestone that veered between mostly four and five-story buildings. The city walls rose 50 feet (15 meters) up. The wall sprouted buttresses and ramparts. All parts of the wall were in dire need of repairs by the 14 th century DR with visible pieces of missing rocks and mortar . Falling chunks of the wall at one point were considered a danger, but the warning signage was ordered to be removed by Lord Darvis Shennelm in attempts to hide the disrepair. The city entrances were protected by portcullis gates and drawbridges. Its harbours were six huge stone piers that extended from Hlath's northern wall, large enough to accommodate the biggest trade and military vessels of the Vilhon Reach.</p>
<p>Outside Hlath's walls were numerous long warehouses that stored the city's main export - lumber. These warehouses stood alongside the Highway of the Sunrise .</p>

<p>Hlath was the northern-most city of Chondath. It boarded the waters of the Vilhon Reach and was connected to a highway that stretched out to Arrabar . It stood approximately 130 miles (210,000 meters) away from the Sea of Fallen Stars . The city was the northern end point of the Emerald Way , a major road that ran throught he entiry country of Chondath.

<h2>Government</h2>
<p>For a period of time around 1358 DR , the city was governed by a council of Three Lords of Hlath. During that time, the lords were: Lord Fior Botpur , Lord Warkas , and Lord Nybahn . By the late 14 th century DR, the rulership was held by a single governor who was under the control of the city of Arrabar .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Hlath was a busy port city. Hlath had two industries. The first one was its humble fishing. The second one was the city's chief export - lumber, specifically timber and exotic woods, the latter of which were shipped out in both carved and raw states. These were cut from the nearby Nunwood , under the watchful eye of the Emerald Enclave . Hlath was locked into a minor trade war with Iljak , while Iljak being a major supplier of grains for Hlath. Hlath maintained strong economic relations with the city of Reth .</p>
<p>The local fishers were famous for their extremely durable long fishing nets.</p>

<p>The church of Silvanus had a shrine to the Forest Father in the city, while the Church of Tyr had a major temple.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The harbours of Hlath were well-protected by a harbor chain and catapults . The city itself was protected by ballistas and heavy catapults . The city also employed the Hlath Guards, infantry armed with short swords and shields . In times of war, Hlath hired mercenariy companies.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hlath was founded in the Year of Bane's Shadow, 267 DR , after Chondathan logging towns of Timindar and Orbech were destroyed in the Battle of Fallen Trees . Following the disaster, King Laviar Illistine was forced to focus his attention on the Nunwood and Hlath became a producer of lumber for the nation.</p>
<p>From 900 DR through 902 DR , Hlath came into prominence after jumpstarting the Chondathan civil war, later named the Rotting War . In the Year of the Thirsty Sword, 900 DR , Hlath's governor at the time was Archmage Whinonas Ferentier who took control of his city. A similar change of power happened in Reth, prompting King Neveris Bikou of Chondath to send his army to Hlath. Both towns, Hlath and Reth, joined forces and sent their armies into a bloody battle against Chondathan's troops along the Emerald Corridor to the south of River Nun . By the Year of the August Armathor, 901 DR , the war turned Hlath and Reth against each other, and Whinonas Ferentier used ancient Netherese sorcery against advancing armies of Hondath and Reth. In response, wizards of Arrabar and Reth retaliated with deadly Netherese magics themselves, scorching the battlegrounds with death and destruction. In the Year of the Queen's Tears, 902 DR , troops from Reth clashed in combat with joined armies of Arrabar and Hlath in the Fiends of Nun , in the foothills of the Akanapeaks . The rulers of Chondathan cities craved an easy win and ordered their wizards to summon deadly necromantic plagues. The resulting epidemic killed two-thirds of the Chondathan armies in minutes. The survivors took the plague home, spreading the deadly disease. The devastating outcome of the Rotting Wars ensured Arrabar's loss of influence. All the cities of Chondath, apart from Iljak declared independence, making Hlath a self-governed city-state.</p>
<p>Hlath gained a naval port in the Year of the Watching Helm, 992 DR , sponsored by the nation of Turmish and its new visionary mercantile leader Lord Saros . By the Year of the Scourge, 1150 DR , Chondath reclaimed rulership over Hlath.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Wandering Waves, 1292 DR , the harbors of the Ravens Bluff suffered the first major pirate attack that left the trade vessel out of Hlath - the Glartaree , destroyed by fires. Its cargo of stone bowl ended up deep in the mud at the bottom of the sea. Circa the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Hlath, along with several other cities, suffered from several raids by orcish tribes of the Akanapeaks .</p>
<p>The Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , the city of Hlath came under attack by a barbarian army from Kara-Tur . Lord Fior Botpur planned the defenses, aided by a group of adventurers who helmed the gathered defenders against armies of Khan Kertep . Before the siege battle, Kertep sent his ninjas into Hlath to weaken the defenders by poisoning food and water and carry out soldier and civilian assassinations. It was later revealed that Khan Kertep was replaced by an arcanaloth named Yrkhetep who led his armies into Faerûn .</p>
<p>In the 1370s DR , Hlath became involved in a conflict with the city of Iljak. Both considered the other the reason for the stagnation of trade. Hlath helmed several raids on its opponent, and the cities used their guard patrols to wage a small-scale war along the Old Road and the Emerald Corridor. This conflict aided trade of Arrabar and Shamph . Despite the war, Hlath left the grain fields of Iljak intact, Hlath being a major purchaser.</p>
<p>With the advent of the Spellplague of the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , the nation of Chondath was destroyed by the wild magics. The cities of Arrabar, Hlath, Iljak, Reth, and Shamph became twisted ruins of danger and lost riches. After the return of Mystra during the Second Sundering , the spell-scarred land of was healed, and as of late-15 th century DR, Arrabar and other cities of Chondath were returned to Toril .</p>
