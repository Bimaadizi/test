<h2>History</h2>
<p>J'Nah worked for Heurodis in trying to acquire the Tower Statue , which contained within it a mythallar .</p>
<p>In 1372 DR , she made a deal with the white dragon Tymofarrar to acquire the four relics in the keeping of Drogan Droganson . But she betrayed the dragon, sending a group of gnolls under her control to attack Tymofarrar's kobolds (who were sent in ahead of time because Tymofarrar wished to see the artifacts for himself first) who were returning from Hilltop with the artifacts. Due to this betrayal, Tymofarrar wanted her dead and would offer an adventurer an item which would aid in killing her.</p>
