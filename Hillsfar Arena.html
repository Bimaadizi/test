<p>The Arena was a large oval structure in Hillsfar where criminals found themselves participating in gladiatorial games, executions, and mock battles.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The arena was located in the northwest corner of the city.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The entire structure was made of granite blocks. A network of tunnels and catacombs were placed under the main structure. A secret passageway connected the catacombs under Castle Maalthiir with the arena. Maalthiir used this tunnel to grab occupants of the arena cells to use for personal entertainment.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Up to 8,000 spectators could be seated in the arena to watch gladiatorial games, executions, and mock battles.</p>
<p>The arena was under supervision of a masked individual only referred to as the Innovator of Pain . The title and the terrifying red spiked mask hid the face of the person who led the title. The Innovator was assigned personally by Maalthiir. The Innovator of Pain gradually broke the bodies and spirits of the gladiators until they were begging for death - the most common way out of the Arena.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>A garrison of 100 Red Plumes guarded the arena at all times. These were mostly green recruits and crowd control was the majority of their job.</p>
