<p>Osvaldo Cassalanter was the heir apparent of the Cassalanter family of Waterdeep in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1489 DR , Victoro Cassalanter and his wife Ammalia signed a contract with Asmodeus , in which they agreed to give up the souls of their children in exchange for power, good health, and long life. Osvaldo, their eldest son, was taken immediately and his body transformed into a chain devil . Terenzio and Elzerina , their youngest twins, were also scheduled to be taken by the archdevil when they turned nine years old in 1492 DR , to be transformed into lemures . The only way to save the children was to pay to the Nine Hells a tremendous amount of coin and the souls of numerous people in sacrifice.</p>
<p>In 1492 DR, Victoro and his wife planned to recover the lost gold of Dagult Neverember and use it to buy back the souls of their children. Victoro focused on searching for the gold while Ammalia was busy with other preparations for the ceremony to save the souls of their children.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Osvaldo had become totally insane and hated his parents but the truth was that the soulless body of Osvaldo now housed a chain devil .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Osvaldo was chained and locked in the attic of Cassalanter Villa where he was held in place by a magical pentagram and guarded by two imps working for Victoro. He desperately tried to free himself by asking for someone to rescue him. Ammalia often wept at her transformed son's feet in the mansion's attic. To everyone but his parents, Osvaldo was studying in a faraway city.</p>
