<p>Mantas , otherwise referred to by their creators as fliers , were a type of submersible barge used by sahuagin to transport both themselves and their ill-gotten gains.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This vessel's surface-dweller name was derived from its resemblance to the creature of the same name . The name used by the sahuagin reflected its ability to gracefully traverse both the ocean's surface and underwater environments.</p>
<p>These vessels were typically constructed from salvaged shipwrecks, and the odd coastal wood. They could typically carry a crew of up to six hundred sahuagin or more. On average, a manta could traverse up to 240 miles (390,000 meters) a day or, if need be, 360 miles (580,000 meters) a day at risk of exhausting the crew (equivalent to a forced march for surface dwellers). This feat was achieved by crew rotation, as two-thirds of the crew would actively be pushing the vehicle forward, while the remainder rested on top of the craft.</p>
