<p>St. Dobla's Abbey was a remote Ilmatari abbey named for Saint Dobla . It was notably the fourth oldest Ilmatari site in the nation of Calimshan .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This remote abbey was located in the Marching Mountains of Calimshan.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Like other Ilmatari abbeys and cloisters in the Marching Mountains, who were beyond the reach of the syl-pasha , the clergy of St. Dobla's were among the most active of Calimshan's Ilmatari clergies in regards to the protection and freeing of slaves .</p>
<p>Uniquely, the clergy of St. Dobla's was focused on preaching equality and coexistence among the genders and sexes . Their abbey was considered to be among the few places in Calimshan where women could not only openly wield influence, but pursue an education.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The clergy of St. Dobla was primarily made up of women and was one of the most populous of the Marching Mountain clergies.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Having a largely female clergy, some outsiders had the false assumption that its members were proponents of matriarchy. In addition, due to the martyr Saint Dobla having been a jhasina in life, some crudely believed that the abbey's clergy engaged in licentious and wanton activities.</p>
