<p>The House of the Moon was a temple of Selûne in the city of Waterdeep on the Sword Coast North in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . It was one of the largest temples in the city and known to be the greatest, and certainly the most opulent and beautiful, of the temples to Our Lady of Silver. It was the center of much moon-related activity in and around Waterdeep.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The House of the Moon stood in the Sea Ward of Waterdeep and faced the south side of Diamond Street between Seawatch Street and the Street of Whispers . Running around the temple on the east, west, and south sides was a passage known as Moonlit Alley. It stood two blocks east of the West Gate and opposite the Tchazzam family villa, and further east lay the Moonstar family villa. It was one of the most significant temples of the Sea Ward.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>It was an imposing edifice with a magnificent entrance that dominated the block and was more grandiose than most of the neighboring noble villas. The four-story temple complex had interior walls built mostly of red clay brick and outer walls were constructed of granite , over which was a façade of white marble tiles, almost 4 feet (1.2 meters) on each side. These were painted with overlapping moonglow spells in the form of runes to display the faith's teachings to the outside world. It had a central hall ringed by lesser domes and tall slender towers of circular or hexagonal plan. Every dome and tower-top was gilt with gold such that the whole temple could sometimes appear entirely golden. Each dome and corner was topped by a spire bearing a crescent moon. A wide stairway led up to the huge double doors under an arch adorned with more symbols of the moon, and flanked by smaller arches. Many balconies and large windows looked out over the streets. Every window was built in the shape of a full or crescent moon.</p>
<p>After the events of the Time of Troubles, it received new front gates of ornate design. These depicted a triumphant Selûne throwing a defeated Shar down amongst the spires of Waterdeep.</p>
<p>By 1492 DR , the House of the Moon was still quite beautiful and now had the tallest temple tower in Waterdeep, with a height of approximately 75 feet (23 meters) above street level. From its top, priests could receive moonlight in all seasons.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>To block scrying , the outer walls were lined with lead between the granite core and the marble façade. These marble tiles were cemented with gorgon 's blood mortar , which was known to block astral or ethereal travel through a wall. By 1370 DR, the windows were protected by a wall of force . In addition, a silvery shining dome of magical force enveloped the temple roof; it could be made opaque or transparent at the high priestess's direction.</p>
<p>Inside the temple, any Selûnite priest of sufficient rank could freely conjure a moon blade , moonweb , or wall of moonlight .</p>
<p>For more martial defense, the Knights of the Half Moon made regular six-strong patrols of the temple, which passed through some areas two or three times an hour. Moreover, groups of two or three stood guard at all hours in the entrance hall, narthex, the east and west guard towers, and particularly in the Chamber of the Shard, which held the greatest artwork.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Inside, the décor was largely grays, whites, and blues, after the moon and the sea. Above the baseboards, the lower halves of the walls were covered in vertical oak panels, firmly fitted and colored a deep blue. Midway up was a horizontal strip of oak molding that was painted a deep sea-blue. Above this, the walls were plastered over in a light aquamarine that shaded to white near the ceiling. In the corridors and many chambers, the ceilings were semicircular arches and domes. In the corridors, these were supported by curved oak fames approximately every 20 feet (6.1 meters) and adjoining the molding on either side; their design was reminiscent of a crescent moon. Below, the floors were covered with circular white marble tiles inlaid with iris agate in designs based on important imagery of the faith. Illumination was provided by twinkling moongleam runes on the ceilings and streaks of silvery continual faerie fire moving along the floors. Arched doorways connect the hallways and chambers.</p>
<p>All throughout, it was lavishly decorated, with pale pink and blue tapestries hung on the walls and carpets of matching hues. Large urns stood in some corners and on plinths and tables. The moon and its phases were depicted everywhere, from over the arches to along the walls and even in gratings.</p>
<p>The temple had a number of hidden spaces and passages, from concealed cavities to whole tunnels. These occupied hollows in the interior walls and were accessed by secret doors, each with a different opening mechanism. Apparently only high priestess Naneatha Suaril and Lady Alathene Moonstar knew the location and trigger of every secret door, but various visitors and infiltrators had discovered some of them over the temple's history. Similarly, many of the floor tiles contained secret compartments, which could be accessed by pressing adjacent tiles in a certain sequence.</p>

<h3>Cellars & Crypts</h3>
<p>Below the temple was a vast and complex network of subterranean constructions, which could be entered only via the back stairs at the ground floor. It included wine cellars, armories, and other storage chambers, as well as many burial vaults, not to mention the tunnels to connect them all. These chambers were protected by various magical guardians. There was also a link to the city's sewer system , in the branch accessed though the surface shaft at the intersection of Sharra's Flight and the Street of Whispers , and another to the vaults beneath the former High House of Stars.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The House of the Moon was a busy place, where people not only worshiped but also socialized, received education, did business, and planned journeys and expeditions. In the library and map room, merchants and ships' captains researched new routes and guides, hunters, and adventurers looked for forgotten trails through untraversable terrains like the Spine of the World . Scions of the Waterdhavian nobility received lessons from the strict priests and priestesses in the afternoons, while the nobles themselves attended grand balls in the splendid surrounds once a month—all for charity, of course.</p>
<p>But for everyday ecclesiastical activities, the priesthood managed a constant flow of petitioners and pilgrims , from early morning to late night. They offered donations, worshiped Selûne, and gazed upon the Wand of Four Moons . Meanwhile, dozens of priestesses played odes to the moon upon their harps all through the day and night from their places in the gallery over the entrance hall. Others sold healing draughts and potions that bestowed various benefits, such as granting infravision from dusk to dawn or keeping the imbiber alert throughout the night while receiving the benefits of a good sleep. The temple also provided cures and healing. On nights of the full moon, when it was visible and the sky was clear, worship took place on the rooftops, and more folk watched and prayed from Diamond Street below.</p>
<p>The annual temple holiday of Selûne's Hallowing celebrated the moon , stars, and navigation. This was originally intended to reenact the purging of Malarites from the region in the Year of Slaughter, 1090 DR , but over the centuries other aspects took precedent and the ceremony evolved. Taking place in the month of Uktar , at the peak of the full moon, it culminated in a parade of the faithful, which left the House of the Moon at moonrise and journeyed through the streets down to the harbor. The high priestess bore the replica Wand of Four Moons at the head of this parade. At the harbor, a ceremony was held to bless all navigators.</p>
<p>The temple also held a festival on the Feast of the Moon .</p>
<h3>Relics</h3>
<p>The temple housed the original Wand of Four Moons , the weapon of Selûne, by 1358 DR. It was stored in a large sky-blue case adorned with pale-yellow images of the lunar phases. However, by 1369 DR , it had been replaced with a replica. This replica was created and blessed by Selûne herself to commemorate her battle with Shar in the city during the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR. Identical in appearance, it levitated within a glass case before the altar in the Church of the Moon and Stars and radiated a soft, silvery-blue light. It had no other powers, but some lucky pilgrims saw it drip Selûne's essence or heard the goddess whisper inspiring or helpful words. When Selûne manifested in the temple, she emerged from this replica. It was said to contain some of her power. It was claimed by some that Naneatha could, with a plea to the goddess, summon the real Wand of Four Moons in place of the replica and wield it with its full power. Selûnite pilgrims came to the temple to see this holy relic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Precursors</h3>
<p>One of Waterdeep's oldest faiths was the worship of Selûne , with Selûnites recorded to have worshiped on the side of Mount Waterdeep as early as the Year of the Half Moon, 390 DR , before there even was a city. The first permanent shrine stood close to the harbor's edge; local legend held that the Selûne's Smile tavern was later built on its foundations.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, for several centuries, it was still but a minor cult, though it never faded away entirely. When Bloodhand Hold dominated the area ( 482 – 882 DR ), good Selûnite lycanthropes formed the Cult of the Howling Moon and assembled in what was later known as the Dancing Court in South Ward .</p>
<p>In 757 DR , the ranking priestess of the area, Priestess of the High Moonlight Rian Liurandel , was informed of the alleged heresy of the New Moon Pact by High Moonmistress Brima Chintamn of Bright Lady's Tower in distant Chancelgaunt . Rian agreed with the charges and condoned the destruction of the lycanthropic Pact.</p>
<p>Though the cult (or specifically its shapechangers) was expelled by Nimoar the Reaver (reigned 882 – 936 DR ), it later returned. Those faithful who stayed assembled in secret for more than a century, until after the Second Trollwar ended in 952 DR .</p>
<p>A small altar and chapel was dedicated to the goddess in the Year of Bright Nights, 985 DR . It stood atop the Plinth of the Moon and Stars , a mage's tower owned by Lunaven Moonstar just north of Waterdeep. A quiet fellowship, the local Selûnites made it the center of their faith in the city for more than a century. After 50 years, it was enclosed by the walls of the growing city. Finally, during a Great Hunt in the Year of Slaughter, 1090 DR , Malarites ambushed Lunaven on his return from Neverwinter , killed him, and looted his magic, which they then used to sack and raze the Plinth on the night of a new moon, desecrating the Selûnite chapel as they went. Because of this blasphemy, three of Selûne's planetar servants, the Shards , arrived outside the city walls and mustered the goddess's followers. After a fortnight, a pack of lycanthropes, over a hundred in number and led by the Shards, hunted down and slaughtered the Malarites and drove the survivors from the land. This "hunt of the hunters" was commemorated with reenactments in later years, ultimately becoming the Selûne's Hallowing procession.</p>
<p>In the aftermath, around the Year of the Dawndance, 1095 DR , the Moonstars and Selûnites gave the Plinth to the Lords of Waterdeep , after which it became a shrine to all small faiths in the city. In exchange, they received vacant land north of the city, for the immediate construction of a proper temple. Work on this project had started almost as soon as the Malarites had been defeated.</p>
<p>The High House of Stars was completed and worship commenced there in the Year of the Gleaming Crown, 1097 DR . With it, the faith flourished in Waterdeep. Lady Alathene Moonstar , granddaughter of Lunaven, established the Maids of the Midnight Moon , an order of Selûnite sorceresses, in the Year of the Restless, 1099 DR . But some years later, in the Year of the Dark Dawn, 1104 DR , her twin brother Lord Vanrak Moonstar blamed the priests of Selûne from the High House of Stars for their father Andvarren's death and publicly split from the church. He later converted to the faith of Shar , turned some of the Moonstars to his cult, and founded the Dark Army of the Night . Alathene and the still-faithful Moonstars took refuge in the High House of Stars before deposing Vanrak.</p>
<p>Finally, in the Year of the Tomb, 1182 DR , the Dark Army of the Night infiltrated the High House of Stars, killed most of the priests, looted the vaults, and burnt it down. They even framed followers of Bane for the crime. Rising as matriarch of House Moonstar, Lady Alathene focused on building a new temple just west of the ruins.</p>
<h3>Early History</h3>
<p>The House of the Moon was opened for worship in the Year of the Soft Fogs, 1188 DR . Over the next ten years, it renewed the faith and attracted many more followers from across the city. Lady Alathene meanwhile withdrew from active participation in the priesthood to continue her investigation of Lord Vanrak in secret from the High House of Stars ruins; the Selûnites called the site desecrated and forbade trespassing. Alathene later made an alliance between the House of the Moons and the drow followers of Eilistraee in Undermountain. Later, in the Year of the Dusty Throne, 1256 DR , the House of the Moon's Priestess of the High Moonlight gave special dispensation to the Moonstars to build a new villa on the High House of Stars site.</p>
<p>In the years after, the Selûnites and Sharrans had only occasional minor conflicts, but no serious fighting. In one of the more significant episodes, following sectarian strife in the Year of the Saddle, 1345 DR , between the local faiths of Selûne, Shar, Tempus , and Lathander , the House of the Moon became the target of another arson attempt by the Dark Army on the Night of Temple Fires but the Selûnite priests managed to thwart the attack. A fortnight after, the Selûnites retaliated, leading allied churches to attack a secret Sharran Temple below Shadows Alley in Castle Ward and destroying more than a hundred shadows .</p>
<h3>The Time of Troubles</h3>
<p>One night during the Time of Troubles of the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , a purported avatar of Selûne arrived in Waterdeep and summoned the faithful to the House of the Moon. High priestess Naneatha Suaril was there to greet her, and temple guards assembled at the temple doors. The avatar promised the faithful her grace and protection. However, one did not believe her: Luna —the true avatar of Selûne—who'd come with her friend Vajra to see for herself. Vajra had already snuck in and out of the temple to find the Wand of the Four Moons , but with no success. As the mob of worshipers and then the temple guards overwhelmed and subdued Vajra, Luna confronted the avatar and the two engaged in a battle of spells on the steps of the temple. Finally, the priests gave the false avatar the Wand of the Four Moons and she used it to knock out Luna. The temple guards took Luna prisoner at the avatar's direction.</p>
<p>Uncertain of this supposed goddess, the Lords of Waterdeep kept the temple under constant surveillance. Her true identity unknown, Luna was kept as a "special guest"—prisoner—at the House of the Moon for a dozen days. The false Selûne had her completely under her control. Learning of this, Luna's friends Vajra, Kyriani , Onyx , and Timoth resolved to rescue her from the temple.</p>
<p>Onyx and Timoth first infiltrated the temple to find Luna. The dwarf snuck in through a secret hole and a grating, and let the centaur through the main doors, and they overcame the Knights of the Half Moon on guard. After stealing their priestly robes, the pair tried to pass themselves off as new converts to Uton and another Knight, but they were skeptical. They found the room where Luna had been held, but she was gone. They were then confronted by Naneatha Suaril and the priests; not believing they were friends of Selûne, she accused them of being agents of Shar , goddess of darkness and foe of Selûne, and she left hell hounds to deal with the intruders instead. Onyx and Timoth fought them off and escaped. Continuing on, they eavesdropped on Naneatha and the avatar, before they were ambushed by the Lunatics , elite but insane temple defenders. Smashing a window, the Lunatics took the fight outside, and battled Onyx, Timoth, Vajra, and Kyriani before the temple. The heroes unmasked one of Lunatics, expecting the dark goddess Shar but finding instead a brainwashed Luna!</p>
<p>Witnessing the battle outside, Naneatha began to question the false Selûne, who soon revealed her murderous intent. Learning that Luna was truly Selûne and that the false avatar was in fact Shar, Naneatha defiantly shoved her off the temple balcony, falling over herself. However, both were saved by Shar's featherfall spell. Shar took out her rage on Naneatha, hurling a meteor swarm ; Naneatha somehow diverted the spell, but not before both were knocked unconscious. Her near self-sacrifice bought time for Luna and her friends to escape the temple. Later that night, Luna transformed fully into an avatar of Selûne, and famously battled Shar over the streets of Waterdeep, her light blasting away Shar's darkness. It became a local legend of the faithful that during the Time of Troubles Selûne battled Shar in Waterdeep and hurled her down amongst the city's spires. The Sharrans were also left greatly weakened.</p>
<p>Afterward, Naneatha had the House of the Moon reconsecrated and its damage repaired. New front gates were installed and its defenses were enhanced.</p>
<h3>Recent History</h3>
<p>In the aftermath of the Time of Troubles, the clergy grew in strength. To atone for being tricked by Shar, Naneatha launched a crusade against Shar's followers, rooted out new Sharran cells, and drove them out of the city by 1372 DR . Meanwhile, the Selûnites made renewed efforts to teach their faith. Naneatha also firmly supported the establishment of the Order of the Blue Moon , dedicated to both Selûne and Mystra .</p>
<p>In the havoc of Halaster's Higharvestide in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the magic of the Sojourner's Portal became warped, and the mirror unleashed a crimson death and three vampiric mists from the depths of Undermountain into the heart of the temple. They hunted and slew a number of priests before they were stopped; the vampiric mists were swiftly destroyed, but the crimson death fled into the sewers and was not seen again. Meanwhile, Naneatha was able to redirect the gate , sending subsequent monsters—a sahuagin patrol, an ettin , two trappers , and a pyrohydra —into the crypts below Shar's Temple of Old Night in Calimport . In the year after, she reconsidered it might be a security risk.</p>
<p>The following year , on learning his goddess Waukeen was held captive by Graz'zt in the Abyss , Holycoin Tharundar Olehm at the Goldspires temple in Athkatla , Amn , alerted the leaders of other good faiths in Faerûn , including the House of the Moon, who offered to help. Kyriani, already in Amn seeking Myth Lharast , teleported the Holycoin's adventurers to the House of the Moon. Selûne herself wished to aid Waukeen, and so she'd permitted the Sojourner's Portal to take the adventurers to her own realm, the Gates of the Moon , so that they might use the Infinite Staircase to reach the Abyss . Kyriani opened the portal for them.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , the House of the Moon came to the aid of Khelben Arunsun when the newly arisen phaerimm threatened the safety of Evereska . Naneatha led a group of her Selûnite priests into battle at the High Moor to support the beleaguered elven soldiers on the ground.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The Church of Selûne in Waterdeep was led by the Priestess of the High Moonlight, who in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR was Naneatha Suaril . She was head of the temple by 1358 DR and maintained this position through 1369 DR and 1372 DR . Serving under the high priestess were the Twelve, a group of lesser high-ranking priests. Low-ranked priests were called acolytes and those in training to become resident priests were known as aspirants or the Called. Ordinary worshipers were often sailors and merchants, as well as wanderers and dreamers.</p>
<p>The temple was staffed with regular priests and priestesses and defended by temple guards, as well as the fanatical Lunatics. During the Time of Troubles, when the false avatar resided there, hell hounds were also kept to deal with intruders.</p>
<p>Circa 1370 DR , the temple had around 120 priests, of which 50 or more were silverstars , about 30 were aspirants, about 30 were clerics (though these were declining), some were mystics, and the rest were crusaders of the Order of the Half Moon knighthood. More than 60% of the priests were female and the majority were human , with small numbers of elves and half-elves , lycanthropes including a half-dozen werecats , and a few tallfellow halflings . Circa 1372 DR, the church counted 240 members, with 153 humans, 24 half-elves, 24 werecats, 12 elves, 12 halflings , 8 gnomes , and 7 of other races, mostly good lycanthropes. They were clerics, bards , druids , rangers , and sorcerers and wizards . Senior members often became silverstars.</p>
<p>Members of the Order of the Blue Moon regularly attended the church in the early 1370s DR and made it their base of operations.</p>
<p>Joining the church required a demonstration of understanding of its teachings and a vow of devotion to Selûne. Though there was no fee to join, there were dues of 5 gp per month. Members were expected to follow the tenets of the faith and perform charity work among the needy, poor, or sick, for about 10 hours a tenday .</p>
<p>The priests came from all kinds of backgrounds and from all levels of society, but their regular association with the noble class rubbed off on them with some self-importance. However, they remained tolerant and devout.</p>
<h3>Abilities</h3>
<p>Members practiced skills in diplomacy and understanding motive, healing, religious lore, and spellcraft and concentration.</p>
<p>Those of strong faith and favored by the temple could receive a blessing from Selûne, saving them from harm for a minute, when under a moonlit sky between sunset and sunrise. Those who were afflicted lycanthropes could better resist changing shape.</p>
<p>Many spellcasting members were initiated into the magical secrets of the church and learned the arts of lunar magic .</p>
<h3>Dress</h3>
<p>The House of the Moon was known to have the most grandiose ceremonial vestments of Selûne's church. Naneatha Suaril presided over ceremonies in a majestic gold-hued dress with a wide-bottomed hooped skirt and a great fan-like collar ascending from the back of her neck, both stiffened with whalebone , all set with clusters of pearls and precious stones. Even lesser priestesses wore robes of silver hue. Such fine vestments were valued at 10 to 100 gp depending on their cleric ranks.</p>
<p>For armor, the temple guards wore chainmail vests and leggings with plate shoulder guards, armbands, bracers, breastplates, greaves, belts, and waist-guards, in silvery and golden hues. Their heads were protected by conical helms with chainmail neckguards. Helms, bracers, and waist-guards were adorned with a crescent moon symbol. With their armor, they wore red cloaks, but they could also don a priest's pale-blue robes over their armor. For weaponry, they carried unique polearms topped with crescent-moon blades, a form of bardiche called a "moonpole". The Knights of the Half Moon were distinctively dressed in pale sea-blue full-length robes with long collars draping below the shoulders and hemmed with a ring of full moons, donned blue-tinted steel skullcaps, and had tattoos of crescent moons on their foreheads. They also carried moonpoles.</p>
<h3>Notable Members</h3>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>The House of the Moon maintained a close alliance with the House of Wonder , part of the Church of Mystra . They often joined forces against the church of Shar .</p>
<p>The Selûnites also based themselves in the Selûne's Smile tavern in the 1370s DR.</p>
<p>The long-standing Moonstar noble family had close ties with the Waterdhavian Church of Selûne, at both the House of the Moon and its predecessor the High House of Stars. But the church's greatest enemy was Lord Vanrak Moonstar and his Dark Army of the Night , who worked to destroy the House of the Moon, the church as a whole, and Selûne herself.</p>
