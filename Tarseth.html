<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tarseth was one of the early clans present during the founding of Tethyr. The marriage of Saraala Tarseth to King Darrom in the Year of Bound Branches, −211 DR helped unify the clans for a time; however, Saraala's own brother Amir I was responsible for the assassination of the king in −183 DR .</p>
<p>To restore the clan's honor, Chieftain Amir's two sons, Amir and Ra'id, killed their own father in support of their cousin Silvam Ithal , who took the throne of Tethyr in his dead father's stead.</p>
<p>The entire clan died out in the Year of Silent Screams, −133 DR , when a massive tidal wave engulfed the city of Velen, slaughtering half of the town's population. (Even as late as 1370 DR , ghosts from Clan Tarseth still haunted the manor house of Millvuthan, then owned by the count of Firedrake . On Midsummer 's night, the anniversary of the tidal wave, the screams of all the drowning souls and the roar of the wave itself could be heard in the physical realm. )</p>
<p>After –133, The clan's lands became a royal protectorate overseen by Prince Tyrom Ithal .</p>
