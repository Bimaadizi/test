<p>The Blind was an ancient beholder who lived in Skullport beneath Waterdeep in the 15th century DR.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>As his name implied, he was blind, and weakened from centuries living in Skullport. He claimed to be the Eye , the infamous Xanathar from Skullport's past but most considered the claim unlikely since the Eye was known to have died in a fight with his former minion, the lich known as Avaereene .</p>
<p>The Blind had an encyclopedic knowledge of Skullport's history.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Blind was too weak to command his own gang but, because he was allied with no gang and vastly knowledgeable about Skullport, the gangs trusted him as an arbitrator of disputes. He was often called upon to serve as a consultant and intermediary between Skullport's gang factions. He sat as adjudicator at many meetings that finalized gang boundaries. Although he was unable to command the respect of gangs or personally enforce rulings, his judgments were respected and maintained.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Blind claimed that while his fight with Avaereene left him severely wounded, his death was a ruse to deceive his rival. As of 1479 DR , he was looking for the Crown of Horns , a relic rumored to be in the Murkstalker 's possession. He believed the artifact would restore his power and help him get revenge on Avaereene.</p>
