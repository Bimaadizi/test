<p>Archivists were powerful divine spellcasters. However, their method of spellcasting was more akin to that of wizards than clerics . These skilled casters were professional at collecting and archiving divine lore.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Archivists could cast spells from prayerbooks . These spells could come from any source of divine lore, such as holy tablets, ancient steles, magical scriptures, divine scrolls , or another archivist's prayer book.</p>
<p>By drawing on their great knowledge of monsters, archivists could strengthen their allies and weaken particular types of monsters that they faced. Such knowledge became greater as the archivist became more experienced. Due to their great mental discipline, archivists became resistant to enchantment spells.</p>
<h2>Alignment</h2>
<p>Archivists were not tied to any specific alignment in the same way that clerics were. In general, they followed whatever morals they chose, but most were of similar alignment to their patron deity. Because of their scholarly approach, they tended to favor lawful alignments.</p>
<h2>Orders of Archivists in Faer√ªn</h2>
<p>There were also significant numbers of archivists in the churches of Mystra and Azuth .</p>
