<p>Oneshield Quarries was a stone-cutting business owned by the dwarf Jarth Oneshield in the town of Red Larch around 1366 DR. Volo noted that although the prices were high, this was justified by the quality of the work, and Jarth was able to pay his employees well.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Oneshield Quarries's dwarven and human workers mined stone in four quarries in the hills east of town. These quarries were guarded by mercenary warriors and adventurers, funded by Jarth Oneshield.</p>
