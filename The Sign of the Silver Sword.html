<p>The Sign of the Silver Sword was an inn in Berdusk in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The inn was located in Berdusk's market quarter area, along the main road that entered the city via its southeastern gate.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The inn was large and well-built, with lush soundproof carpeting throughout and driftglobes used as lighting within the rooms. The place was extremely quiet, but well-furnished. Guest rooms each contained a bath, a writing table, a canopied bed, and a soft easy chair. Each room also had privacy bars that could be placed to block doors and windows from within.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Aside from lush living arrangements, the inn provided food of fair quality, often using very fresh ingredients sourced from the River Chionthar . However, service itself was almost nonexistent, with the staff speaking little and taking long periods of time to fulfill requests from guests.</p>
