<p>Qirozz ( pronounced : / k ɪ r ˈ r oʊ z / kir-ROZ was an archdevil duke of the Nine Hells who served the Lord of the First, Zariel . The Archduchess was known for her lavish balls, but was a duchess of Avernus all the same, and a capable strategist.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Qirozz had purple skin and large horns.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Qirozz was an ever-vain devil who enjoyed finding and exploiting the weaknesses of her foes, and was particularly fond of baiting and toying with paladins by testing their faith and competence. She liked entertainment and when hosting her balls sought both to enjoy herself and ensure her guests did as well. She was known to make bold challenges to those whose presence she enjoyed, inviting them to activities of their choosing, often exerting herself in the process of strenuous ones and needing to take quick rests as a result.</p>
<p>All that in mind, Qirozz was still possessed of a respect for proper form and etiquette and was fully capable of being politically minded in her plans and demeanor. She was too good a tactician to allow things like boredom to undermine her strategies.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Qirozz wore jewelry on each finger and a ceremonial breastplate inlaid with carved bone.</p>
<p>Qirozz's most prized possession was her Fetid Chalice , an item of exquisite and terrible beauty fashioned from the skull of a celestial . The canine cranium was bedecked with gems , gilded with arcane symbols, and inlaid with gold . She was proud of the item and would gladly brag about how she obtained it.</p>
<h2>Realm</h2>
<p>Qirozz's estate was a citadel in the midst of a vast, cratered plain, a tower-like fortress carved out of a basalt formation and protected by a 20‑foot-tall (6.1‑meter) wall. Several members of her large army of devils defended the stronghold.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Every six hundred and sixty-six days, Qirozz hosted a ball to show off her chalice. She spared no expense on these grand galas, filling the air with music from skillful bards and ensuring a selection of delicacies from across the planes were on offer.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Qirozz was known to ride into battle on the back of an ancient red dragon .</p>
<p>Qirozz enjoyed the presence of Zaralais the androsphinx at her balls, for reasons beyond him. For his part, he only came because he was afraid of her and was extorted into attending.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Qirozz predated Zariel's rise to power in Avernus and managed to keep her position as a tactician even after she took over the layer.</p>
<p>Eons ago, Qirozz was locked in combat with adventurers who summoned to their aid the hound -headed angel Verwyr . In the end both the adventurers and the angel were slain, and Qirozz decided to strip the flesh from the celestial and fashion its skull into the Fetid Chalice.</p>
<p>Somewhere around the late 15 th century DR the Fetid Chalice became unusable for Qirozz, for any liquid poured into it became holy water . Unbeknownst to Qirozz, fragments of Verwyr lingered on within the goblet, and she was responding to a supernatural "call from on high" for aid. The duchess persisted with her parties despite the chalice's condition, only for it to be stolen by adventurers on behalf of Dara , the Chosen of Ilmater . Using her divine powers, Dara returned the long-dead angel to life with a kiss on the forehead.</p>
<p>When she learned of the theft of the chalice, she destroyed all the furniture of one of her rooms in a rage, eventually calming down while remaining highly annoyed by the robbery and worried about the hit to her prestige. As such, she sought a new prize or noteworthy deed to complete to restore her damaged reputation.</p>
