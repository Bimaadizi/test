<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Halibut was a species of brown-colored on top and white bottom flatfish that could reach relatively massive size. This fish was popular for its fresh taste and solid texture, especially palatable when grilled.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Halibut could be found inhabiting the Sea of Swords near the Baldur's Gate , feeding the city's fishers. In Northwest Faerûn , halibut was fished from the Sea of Moving Ice . Halibut was also found in the Sea of Fallen Stars : the eastern nation of Aglarond and Ravens Bluff in the Vast , where halibut was sold at the Shark Fin eatery for a single silver piece .</p>
<p>Beyond Faerûn, halibut inhabited cold oceans of Kara-Tur.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Pilos Lafrett of Baldur's Gate invented a device that used balanced weights that would allow the fisher to do the fishing on its own, while Pilos could nap. His boss Tohil was informed of the invention and that it would be producing labor-free halibut.</p>
