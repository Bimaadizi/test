<p>The Howling Kupuk was a pass through the Lugsaas Chain mountains that connected northeastern Vaasa to southern Alpuk .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The pass was narrow and prone to avalanches. It was named for the native kupuk of the Alpuk region, whose eggs were often the object of the northward expeditions of adventurers, explorers, and collectors who used the trail. However, any howling to be heard was more likely from winter wolves .</p>
<p>During the 14 th century DR , the pass was an entry point to the Great Glacier , and the mountains on either side of it were completely encased in pure white ice and snow. By the late 15 th century DR, the Glacier had retreated to many miles north of the pass.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Howling Kupuk pass traversed the Lugsaas Chain from south-to-north just west of where they met the northern tip of the Galena Mountains . The northern end of the pass was crossed by a treacherously icy stream 30 yards (27 meters) wide and 4 to 8 feet (1.2 to 2.4 meters) deep, which had to be forded during the 14 th century DR but which was spanned by a bridge as of the late 15 th century DR.</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, the trail that ran through the pass originated on the Vaasan side north of Palischuk at the base of the High Walk . It traveled north along the Galenas and passed Ishe before entering the pass and crossing the stream. It then turned east toward Frohm's Rest on the north shore of Taak Lake .</p>
<p>The pass itself was only about 10 miles (16 kilometers) long.</p>
