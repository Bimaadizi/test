<p>Felsul was a type of deciduous tree that thrived in harsh conditions.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Felsul trees were often gnarled and twisted, and had flaky brown bark from the hue of cinnamon to deep brown and a soft wood. They typically flowered briefly in the early spring.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Fresh felsul wood could be eaten to decrease nausea and to numb the mouth and throat to enable eating and sleeping. Felsul wood did not burn well and was too weak to have much other use.</p>
<p>Felsul flowers could be crushed to make an alluring, spicy perfume simply called felsul flower oil . An ounce of this perfume cost 100 gp . A sack of flowers could be sold for 5â€“30 sp .</p>
<p>Felsul root was sometimes used for small carvings, such as for holy symbols , figurines, and toys.</p>
<h2>Habitats</h2>
<p>Felsuls were often found in cold, rocky places with poor soil. They could grow where no other tree could: in poor soil, on cliff sides, and in crags.</p>
