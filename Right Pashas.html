<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Right Pashas held territory in Little Calimshan , a neighborhood in the Baldurian Outer City .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The crew worked in direct opposition to the the Guild of Baldur's Gate, and the Kingpin of Little Calimshan, Rilsa Rael . The Right Pashas viewed the criminal organization as outsiders to their neighborhood. They sought to rout her agents from the neighborhood in an ongoing gang war that broke out in the district each night.</p>
<p>Not all of the crew's activities were violent however. Some more wholesome members chose to spend their time selling brownies , to raise money to brighten the lives of Little Calimshan's children.</p>
