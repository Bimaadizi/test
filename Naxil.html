<h2>History</h2>
<p>Naxil trained as a sorcerer and alchemist under his father before joining the Church of Vhaeraun .</p>
<p>In 1379 DR , Naxil had recently converted to Eilistraee . He was patrolling an entry to the Promenade of the Dark Maiden when Leliana Vrinn asked his help in dealing with a strange construct . Following the construct, Naxil and Leliana inadvertently entered a gate leading them to a secret portion of Trobriand's Graveyard . There, they were attacked by ooze followers of Ghaunadaur and Naxil nearly lost his life. There they met the Darksong Knight Cavatina Xarann that had just managed to became again material and together they escaped back to the Promenade.</p>
<p>Later during the Ghaunadaur 's followers attack to the Promenade Naxil helped Leliana in the battle with a ghaunadan .</p>
<p>The ghaunadan pursued Naxil until he arrived to the Pit where the Ghaunadaur 's priests were trying to awoke the avatar of their god.</p>
<p>Naxil was put inside the Pit together with Jub and Mazrol but he alone managed to escape, reemerging in a Promenade full only of ooze and with the avatar of Ghaunadaur finally awoke. Naxil come with an idea how to defeat the ooze god: sacrificing himself he tricked the avatar into attaching itself to him and after he went through a magical portal that led to a plane of endless mazes. Although Naxil was killed in the process, he trapped Ghaunadaur’s avatar in the mazes.</p>
