<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kayliss and the other Blackdagger pirates were the scourge of their stretch of the Sword Coast for well over a decade after the Year of Ten Terrors, 1429 DR . Their violent raids came to an end however when Blackdagger himself drew the ire of the great black wyrm Garrundar the Vile. The dragon cursed Captain Blackdagger, binding him to Pirates' Skyhold for the rest of his mortal days and beyond, from his death through his transformation into the undead . Refusing to allow his existence to end on the dragon's terms, Blackdagger willed the curse to inflict his the rest of his pirate subjects, including Kayliss and the crew of her own skyship – after their death, they too would rise as undead abominations. Garrundar assailed each of the Blackdagger fortifications on the isle, causing many of the pirates to die of starvation, or drinking from the poisoned waters of the Vilebog .</p>
<p>Captain Kayliss and her undead pirate followers remained trapped within Scoundrel's Retreat within Pirates' Skyhold despite numerous attempts to fly one of their ships away from the isle. During each attempt, every crew member aboard disintegrated into nothingness and the pilot-less vessel fell out of the sky into the Sea of Swords below. After decades of futility and losing all but two of Blackdagger's vessels, Kayliss seemed resigned to her fate as set forth by the terms of Garrundar's curse.</p>
<p>A gleam of hope appeared for Kayliss and her crew in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , when the Buccaneer's Tear of Company Yargo sailed up to Pirates' Skyhold. Kayliss was determined to apprehend the ship's crew and force them to somehow free her and her fellow pirates from the curse and allow them leave from the isle. This turned out to be wishful thinking however, as Company Yargo enlisted the aid of the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge to recover Kayliss' skyship for their own, as it was the only vessel that remained beyond the Black Scourge of Captain Blackdagger. The adventurer delved into the retreat and destroyed Captain Kayliss and her fellow cursed undead, allowing Captain Shil Yargo to add one more vessel to Company Yargo's feet.</p>
