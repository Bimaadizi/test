<p>Thayan slavers were those malevolent individuals from Thay who traveled across the Realms capturing and subjugating other living beings.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Considering there were fewer realms that allowed slavery as opposed to those who opposed it, Thayan slavers often worked under some guise that granted them anonymity.</p>
<p>They often congregated in the great Thayan cities of Bezantur , Eltabbar , and Tyraturos , each of which had a sprawling slave market.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Slavers were highly skilled at inflicting non-lethal harm with their attacks. A slaver's strikes could even cripple, stun, and even paralyze their subjects, or any foes they struck.</p>
<p>Similarly, Thayan slavers were considered experts at breaking down the will of other beings.</p>
