<p>Grond Peaksmasher was a little-known son of Hiatea and a true demigod ―unlike the rest of the giant-kin progenitors―who was worshiped by the firbolgs of the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to the Moonshae firbolgs, Grond using a weapon known as the Silver-Hafted Axe to carve the Isles out of a single piece of rock and that the leftovers became them, while the rubble became the dwarves . A less apocryphal theory is that his mother Hiatea granted him dominion over the Moonshae firbolgs to teach him responsibility while she concentrated on other matters.</p>
<p>Regardless of how it came about, he arrived to the Moonshae Isles with his followers in tow in -6000 DR , where they settled primarily in the South Jotunhammer Mountains of Norland .</p>
<p>In -5000 DR , Grond became trapped under the glacier Ice Peak on Oman's Isle . It is unknown how he came to be trapped there. Firbolg legends claimed that dwarves had stolen the foot out from under him, causing him to fall into a hole that had been carved out by his axe, and then a sheared-off mountaintop fell atop of the hole. Regardless of how it happened, being incarcerated so left Grond to drift into a deep slumber.</p>
<p>Without Grond's guidance, his supplicants devolved into a barbaric race, and they went on to be used as pawns by the powers who attempted to wrest control of the islands away from the Earthmother . They remained as such until the Era of Upheaval when he woke up and made a deal with both Helm and Talos to have their followers free him in order to gain a strong foothold on the Moonshaes.</p>
<p>In 1365 DR , when a combined tribe of firbolgs and trolls opened a way out of his prison with the rediscovered Silver-Hafted Axe and the aid of Deirdre Kendrick , he broke his accord with both gods and sided with the Earthmother against them.</p>
<p>Grond aimed to encourage his followers to abandon their degenerate ways and aspire to be more like the mainland firbolgs, including becoming reclusive from humans and demihumans. To achieve this, he sponsored a migration of his followers to Oman's Isle and converted tribal shamans to the ways of true priests. He hoped to have achieved his goal within a century of his freedom, but it seems he didn't anticipate the encroachment of Faerie on the archipelago as Oman's Isle was dominated by fomorians and their cyclops servants by 1479 DR .</p>
