<p>Shantel Othreier was a realm of gold and moon elves during the First Flowering (founded roughly −23,600 DR ).</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Shantel Othreier covered the part of west Faerûn where the areas later known as the Greenfields lay.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At the start of the Crown Wars ( −12,000 DR ), Aryvandaar began pressuring Shantel Othreier to accept Aryvandaar occupation following the invasion of Miyeritar .</p>
<p>During the Second Crown War , Shantel Othreier participated in the Sable Wars in −11,450 DR , aiding Eiellûr and Thearnytaar with Keltormir . Together, these nations attempted to invade Ilythiir , aiming to reform or conquer the dark elves before they destroyed any more realms. Over half their forces were wiped out by the dark elves' corrupt magic.</p>
<p>When negotiations with Aryvandaar broke down in −10,900 DR , Aryvandaar launched an invasion, starting the Third Crown War . The Battle of the Gods' Theater was fought in −10,700 DR , one of the greatest and bloodiest battles of the Crown Wars. Over 70,000 elves died as an orc horde fell upon the battling armies of Aryvandaar and Shantel Othreier. Aryvandaar was victorious and occupied the northern half of Shantel Othreier. Aryvandaar fully conquered Shantel Othreier in −10,600 DR , after the mysterious death of Coronal Ynloeth , ending the Third Crown War. Following this, resistance movements sprang up in Shantel Othreier and neighboring Miyeritar.</p>
<p>The Fourth Crown War resulted in much of Shantel Othreier being burned around −10,110 DR by the forces of the Ilythiiri , as they battled Aryvandaar. Shantel Othreier was destroyed by −10,100 DR .</p>
