<p>Barrel Lane was a main thoroughfare in Daerlun , Sembia , circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . This street ran southeast from the Place of Banners (a large open area in the center of Daerlun that contained the seat of government, Bergun Hall ), to the southern gate out of the city known as the Sea Arch. There, it connected to the road to Urmlaspyr . About a third of the way from the Sea Arch to the Place of Banners, Saurovin Street branched off to the east-northeast and headed to the Westmarket .</p>
