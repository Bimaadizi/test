<p>Insight Park was a public park in Baldur's Gate , that was magically created during the midâ€“15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In addition to the green lawns and natural thickets, Insight Park featured a single unidentifiable tree, known as the Drawing Tree . When properly treated, and carefully removed by its caregiver, the tree's bark showed scenes of the future, depicted in sap that resembled blood.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Impatient Son, 1452 DR , the shield dwarf druid Torimesh returned to Baldur's Gate after a many-decade career as an adventurer. He then bought a small plot of land that was being used as a junkyard. Torimesh used his druidic magic to create a lush, mini-forest to grow over the land, so that the poorer Baldurians could appreciate the beauty of nature.</p>
