<p>Akkaido was a major port city of the island of Tsukishima , Wa , that catered to both sea-faring vessels and space-facing spelljammers .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The city's most prominent feature was its harbors that held several hundred vessels, both fishing and mercantile.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Akkaido was built on the hilly southern shores of Tsukishima. The lands that became Akkaido were known for being natural harbors of the Sea of Patience .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>In 1754, the nation of Wa was forced to cut most of its international trade under the rulership of Shogun Matasuuri Nagahide . Despite its centuries-long international trade, Akkaido became the only trade port of Wa open to foreign merchants. All international imports were strictly regulated and placed under imposed limits. Despite that, the city's busy trade brought dozens of ships filled with exotic goods on a daily basis. The main consumers of expensive imported goods were upper-class inhabitants of Wa.</p>
<p>Another major industry in Akkaido was fishing. The lion's share of the industry belonged to large fishing companies, while numerous smaller fishing vessels belonged to individuals. The biggest of the companies belonged to the Jejima family. Their eight large tuna fishing boats sailed along the coast with a net stretched between two vessels, scooping up the Sea of Patience's abundant catch.</p>
<p>The shipbuilding industry in Akkaido was renowned for its speed and quality. The city was considered to be home to the best shipbuilders in Wa. Small fishing boats were built in a week, larger net-fishing vessels took a month, large trade ships were constructed in five months, and warships took from four to six months.</p>
<h3>Culture</h3>
<p>Akkaido had a high academic population, attracted to the port city for its exposure to outsiders and foreign cultures. Just like with trade, intellectual exchange was strictly regulated. Permissions to interact with foreign cultures and sciences had to be acquired from Wa's Ministry of Foreign Affairs . However, a high level of unsanctioned intellectual exchanges was suspected as the number of students that desired to study under willing outlanders was much higher than the allowed supply of permits from the Ministry.</p>
<p>Regular boat races were events of note in Akkaido.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The defenses of Akkaido were centered on the city's harbors, which could hold up to 500 vessels. Some of them were well-armed patrol ships that regularly traversed coastal areas and 5 miles (8 kilometers) into the waters of the Sea of Patience.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Akkaido was a long-standing busy port city of Wa. It was famed for trade with the nations of Kara-Tur . In Wa Year 1754 (1336 DR) , however, a new shogun came to power, Matasuuri Nagahide . With a swift rollout of xenophobic laws, all international trade in the nation was severed, and all foreign merchants were ordered to leave. Those who stayed were executed. Akkaido was the only exception from the sweeping rule, allowing the import of international goods under the strict control of the city's daimyo. As of Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR) , the daimyo was Matasuuri Ieysuna .</p>
<p>At some point in his youth, Jejima Tyo , Ieysuna's cousin, fished out a ningyo king. The man was furious at the fisherman, but Tyo's masterful negotiation quelled the sea creature's wrath. The ningyo king was convinced to become Jejima Tyo's partner. This alliance made Tyo the most profitable fishing businessman in Akkaido, always having access to the most numerous schools of tuna in the Sea of Patience. Tyo used an enchanted biwa of charm to ensure maximum catch.</p>
<p>Another event of note was the "unfortunate deaths" of all 140 individuals who were involved in the creation of the tsunami and the locust space-faring ships. An emperor-sanctioned bill announced the team of inventors had perished in a "freak greek fire explosion" in Akkaido's harbors.</p>
