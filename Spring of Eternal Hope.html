<p>The Spring of Eternal Hope was a temple in Shussel , Unther , in the midâ€“14 th century DR dedicated to the Untheric goddess Ishtar , an aspect of the goddess Isis .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the tyrannical reign of the god-king Gilgeam , this and other temples of Ishtar were mandated to turn over half of their funds to him. The priesthood of the temple tried their best to remain neutral around the growing rebellion against Gilgeam's reign, even in light of the attacks they suffered by his priests. And only their intervention around this time prevented most of Shussel's inhabitants from starving.</p>
<p>When Gilgeam's government collapsed following his death during the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR , the clergy of the Spring of Eternal Hope became the de facto government of Shussel.</p>
