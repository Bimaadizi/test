<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1372 DR , Mariners' Alliance stoke an extremely profitable trading deal via Shoreside Shipping Consortium , trading along the Delimbiyr River . The trading vessel called Barracuda was involved in regular shippings of weapons and armor that passed through Daggerford. Suspiciously enough, Barracuda's final destination was omitted from the logs kept in Mariners' Alliance guildhall.</p>
<p>That information became available to the group of adventurers guided by Astriel Shalyn in investigating recent threats against the city of Daggerford. The adventurers investigated the guildhall, eventually recovering the thick ledger that led them to the Barracuda , and eventually, to discover the Mariners' Alliance treacherous deal with the Zhentarim , accepting shipments of weapon and armor, passing them through the city and shipping them to the growing orc horde, all part of the complex plan to take over the city's government.</p>
