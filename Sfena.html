<p>Sfena was a powerful tiefling and the founder and leader of the Iron Throne but also the daughter of Glasya .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sfena was a unique baatezu born from Glasya and a unknown father, and so the granddaughter of Asmodeus ; Sfena was trained as assassin in Baator , working for her mother who kept a tight rein on her movements and prevented her from advancing in the baatezu hierarchy. However, in 1347 DR , during a mission on Faerûn , a strange incident occurred when she was captured by storm giants : her body transformed into a hard crystalline substance, which had the effect of removing her connection to Baator, allowing her to stay in the Material Plane . Sfena decided to create the Iron Throne as method to cure herself: her plan was to construct a powerful organization and trade it to a powerful devil in exchange for a cure.</p>
<p>The first part of Sfena's plan worked very well and soon, thanks to her plots the Iron Throne gained a position of prominence. However, her traitorous Iron Throne lieutenant Maready informed Sfena's parent of her location and in 1371 Sfena was forcibly brought back to Baator.</p>
