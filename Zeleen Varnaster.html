<p>Zeleen Varnaster was the leader of the wererat bandit group known as the Whiskered Gang in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Zeleen was ruthless and deceitful. She was more than willing to fight and to kill for what she wanted, and to lie to anyone she couldn't fight or kill.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Although the members of her gang deferred to her leadership, they regarded her as easily replaceable.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the late 15 th century DR, Zeleen and her gang used the Shrine of Savras outside the ruins of Conyberry as a home base. However, when the white dragon Cryovain arrived in the area and began driving monsters out of the Sword Mountains , the wererats were chased away from the Shrine by a group of orcs . Zeleen soon led her gang to the Mountain's Toe gold mine, where they killed most of the miners, claimed the mine as their new home, and Zeleen began attempting to pass herself off as the mine overseer to any visitors who came snooping around. This put her on a collision course with Don-Jon Raskin , the new overseer being sent by the mine's owners in Neverwinter around the same time.</p>
