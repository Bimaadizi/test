<p>He discovered from records in his temple in Cimbar that a very powerful artifact essential to the spread of the ancient Chessentan Empire had been lost on the Pirate Isles before the empire's decline. He knew almost nothing about this artifact but believed that Lathander would guide him. He traveled all over the isles in search of ancient Chessentan ruins. However, he feared that someone else would want the artifact for personal profit and did not wish to inadvertently give away a vital clue to its nature or location, so he was tight-lipped about his quest.</p>
