<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Dung Gate was a barbican gate with two portcullises ; however, only one of the portcullises was functional in the year 1370 DR . It provided access through the northeastern wall of Zazesspur, which was 20 feet (6.1 meters) high. It was one of the older gates to the city, but being an entrance into the High City , north of the Sulduskoon River , it was not as old as the oldest structures of the city.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Like other gates of the city, it was guarded by six troops, who could sound an alarm for reinforcements if needed. The gate was closed at sunset and reopened at sunrise.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR , Zaranda Star and her caravan entered the city through a breach in the wall near the Dung Gate, to avoid having to bribe the guards to enter.</p>
