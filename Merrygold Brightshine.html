<h2>History</h2>
<p>When efforts to rebuild Leilon began, the Church of Lathander eagerly donated to the project in order to open the first temple in the reclaimed town. Merrygold thus had the honor of overseeing the rebuilding and restoration of Leilon's original Shrine of Lathander, which made him one of the original founders of the new town at Leilon. With the adoration of the people cementing his importance in the community, he soon became a member of the town council.</p>
<p>When Leilon came under attack from the Cult of Talos and the townsfolk and laborers were driven out, Merrygold called for his fellow councilors to act fast to find a pair of missing children without regard for the dangers, putting him at odds with the head of the council, Grizzelda Copperwraught .</p>
