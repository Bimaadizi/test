<p>Samra is a small fishing town in Chondath .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Samra was a relatively small fishing town. It had few defenses and no walls. The city had docks, but they were unaccommodating for bigger vessels, leaving Samra deprived of a huge part of the trade in the Vilhon Reach .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Samra stood on the southern shore of the Vilhon Reach, in the immediate vicinity from Iljak to the west and Shamphto the south. Two trade routes could be found to the city's south â€“ the Old Road and the Emerald Way . An underwater merfolk town was in the Vilhon, north of Samra, in the Echoing Canyon of Ovlos .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Samra is ruled by a mayor and a council of elected elders. Circa the late-14 th century DR , the title of the mayor belonged to Malil Entwine , the owner of a local fishing company. Samra paid taxes to the capital of Arrabar .</p>
<p>The city of Iljak showed mistrust and caution when dealing with its neighboring Samra, the attitude caused by a war of many centuries prior. by the 14 th century DR , Iljak outgrew Samra. Sages said that Samra was "living on the good graces of Iljak." Samra and Shamph's relations were strained as well. Sapra's government's stance was that Shamph should maintain order in the region and build peace between feuding Chondathan cities.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Samra was founded in the Year of the Barbed Wind, 50 DR on the southeastern shore of the Vilhon, the same year that gave birth to the cities of Mussum and Arrabar. The Year of the King's Destiny, 137 DR brought conflict to Samra. The city of Iljak became embittered by its trade competition with Samra and Mussum, and on Flamerule 12 , it sent armies to Mussum. While Iljak and Mussum were locked in a stalemate, Samra sent its own armies in early Eleasius . Samra raided Iljak and then flanked Iljak's armies, winning the war following Iljak's surrender. The cities of Mussum and Samra sold the surviving inhabitants and warriors of Iljak into slavery and torched the city.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Resolute Courtesans, 139 DR , Samra became one of the importers of Chondalwood lumber. By the Year of the Smiling Princess, 143 DR , the cities that would later become Chondath , under the leadership of Anthony Illistine , attacked and destroyed the elven city of Ariel-than of Chondalwood. The massacre became known as the Battle of the Elven Tears and was retaliation for elves attempting to halt Chondathan lumbering operations. Six months after the Battle of the Elven Tears, Lord Anthony Illistine became the first Governor of Chondath and assembled the city-states of Arrabar, Mussum, Samra, and Shamph into the nation of Chondath.</p>
