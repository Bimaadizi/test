<p>The Sorrowwood was a small circular grove of magical oak trees located within the vast High Forest in the North . Following the collapse of the elven empires during the Crown Wars , and even after the Retreat , they served as a living reminder of the everlasting elven history on Faer√ªn .</p>
<p>Those who came to the Sorrowwood in search of knowledge could be taken into a spectral vision of events and people of history, with whom the visitor would have to interact in order to return to their current time on Toril . These simulacrums were so real to the viewer they often returned with very-real wounds and mementos from their experience.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These ancient oaks were so intertwined with the rest of the High Forest, it was believed their roots touched those of every other tree within the great woodlands. Their leaves would change throughout the year, like the common oak, but never fell from their branches. They were bright green during the spring and summer months, turned to gold and red during autumn and changed to a brown hue in the winter.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These trees were planted by the elves of Aryvandaar , over 10,000 years before the Era of Upheaval . It was named the Sorrowwood by the elves of Sharrven as their history was so closely connected to years of conflict, melancholy and death.</p>
