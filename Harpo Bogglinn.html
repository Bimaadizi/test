<p>At some point in or before the mid-14 th century DR, Harpo was blamed for the death of his brother whilst defending the homeland from an orcish horde. Harpo's younger brother fell to the orcish blades as the hin prince himself laid wounded by an orog arrow in his throat. Harpo survived the battle but was rendered permanently mute by the wound. The grieving halfling king lashed out at Harpo, banishing him from Toril in disgrace, commanding the prince not to return until he personally slew one thousand and one orcs.</p>
