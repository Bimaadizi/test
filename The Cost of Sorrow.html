<p>The untitled book that had the tentative name The Cost of Sorrow was a romance novel and the third volume of four, all unpublished drafts penned by the amateur novelist Roan Featherway in or before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This volume was penned in a beautifully bound journal. That was once the case as the completed work was rugged with its pages ripped, replaced, and glued over, affixed to the book's spine with twine. The cover boldly read "Volume III" and hd its tentative title written underneath, followed by a number of question marks.</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>The third volume of Roan Featherway's work focused on the drama between Roa and the series' antagonist, General Ketheric Thorm . It included a confrontation between the two in which Roa screwed at his opponents in animalistic rage, demanding to know the General's reasons for following the dark goddess Shar and destroying the village of Moonhaven . Ketheric responded, stepping over dead Harpers on the ground, with a cruel statement that Shar knew all and he was on her holy mission. Roa claimed that the people of Moonhaven trusted the general, and his Dark Justiciar attack was a betrayal, and the General responded by saying that Shar's servants needed target practice. The story continued with a duel between the lone Silvanite druid and the Sharran General.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Roan Featherway was himself a druid of Silvanus , and his work was heavily inspired by the events of the war between General Ketheric Thorm and the joint forces of Harpers and the Emerald Enclave that took place in the late 14 th century DR. The draft novel's characters included the real druid of the Emerald Grove, Halsin . As of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , it remained unknown whether the manuscript was ever published, just like the rest of the drafts in the series.</p>
