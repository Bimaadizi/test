<p>Endevver Buns , also colloquially known as Endevver's Reveltongue or simply cinnamon rolls , were sweet breads of layered sugar and generous amount of cinnamon .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These cinnamon buns were invented by a Cormyrean cook and chapbook writer named Endevver . He first published his recipe for the sweet rolls in the Year of Frostfires, 292 DR . The cook's daughter once said that the buns' taste was "like my tongue is enjoying a revel." Endevver found it so amusing he named the treat Endevver's Reveltongue.</p>
<p>The popularity of the recipe persisted well into the late 15 th century DR , when a nephew, or similarly related family member of a coin-hungry pawnbroker, Raylin Pendro , showed up in the town of Targos in Icewind Dale in the 1490s DR. He took over Raylin's pawnshop and turned it into a bakery that made some of the best cinnamon rolls on all the Sword Coast , according to Kira Darvis .</p>
