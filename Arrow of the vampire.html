<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid-14 th century DR , many enchanted arrows of the vampire were a common sight along the Sword Coast , and used by numerous individuals and factions. The origin of these arrows, however, remained a mystery. Some told stories that arrows of the vampire were made using teeth of actual vampires .
