<p>Olhydra , the Princess of Evil Water, was a powerful archomental from the Elemental Plane of Water .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In her natural state, she appeared as a huge cresting wave with two eyes like large pearls or as a shapeless watery mass about 20 feet (6.1 meters) in diameter.</p>
<h2>Domain</h2>
<p>In the Plane of Water, Olhydra lived in the ruins of a great undersea stronghold, made of black coral — the former capital of a world-spanning empire, which Olhydra had long ago destroyed. This citadel was richly lardened, but any would-be robbers had to think twice, as a dozen water elementals guarded the area.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Olhydra delighted in creating dangerous and destructive manifestations of water. She was eager to smash any vessel in her realm and destroy any city and town within her reach. She could surge forth tirelessly and relentlessly, but was patient enough to know when to draw back and when to attack, eroding her opponent.</p>
<p>Of all the Princes of Elemental Evil , she was the most interested in mortals. She recognized pirates and seafaring raiders as her agents, whether they knew it or not, because they reddened the water with blood and occasionally dropped treasure into her clutches. She sometimes spared the worst of them, knowing they would deliver others to her.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Olhydra was also affiliated with the Cult of the Crushing Wave .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Neither Olhydra nor her followers were fond of Imix and his followers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Olhydra made an appearance within the mountain enclave of the blue dragon Abazigal , in Calimshan .</p>
