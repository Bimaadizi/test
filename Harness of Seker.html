<p>The harness of Seker was a boon granted by Seker to those in need.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The device was shaped like a glove with holes for fingers, and a harness extending down the wrist and forearm.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The harness only worked for good-aligned clerics and even then only to destroy undead; it was in fact harmful to touch by anyone who was not good-aligned.</p>
<p>The harness vibrated if undead were within 30 ft (9.1 m). While worn by a good-aligned cleric, should they extend this arm towards an undead in sight within that range and speak Seker's name, the harness would blast the undead with an extremely powerful bolt, certain to annihilate any but the most powerful undead on the spot.</p>
<p>The harness granted by the altar in the Crypt of Badr Al-Mosak held up to five charges, depending on the object sacrificed to it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>An altar of Seker granted the harness of Seker to those who sacrificed a magical item in the Crypt of Badr Al-Mosak . When that one ran out of charges, it returned the item sacrificed; no individual would be granted the harness twice.</p>
