<p>Fullpoint was a small village in Thesk in 1373 DR , placed along a detour from the Golden Way . The farmer Hemish and his adopted daughter Araluen lived there. On the spring of 1373 DR , the town was attacked by blightspawned volodni , only to be saved by the timely intervention of Gunggari Ulmarra and the cleric Marrec , who sought the child of light in Hemish's care. The town's treasury had been spent in seed earlier that year, so they could not be rewarded for their help.</p>
