<p>A shaper was a type of psion who specialized in the metacreativity discipline of psionics , honing their skills in drawing ectoplasm or matter from the Astral Plane to conjure solid and semi-solid projections of armor or weapons , as well as animated astral constructs . They were equivalent to the conjurers of arcane magic .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Shapers were typically very outgoing people, eager to make new friends and acquaintances, but due a perfectionist nature they could be temperamental whenever they were working on crafts. Those who specialized particularly in the making of constructs tended to have a manipulative streak, while those who focused on the manipulation of ectoplasm tended to be very easygoing and malleable.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Among the six classes of psions, shapers were the most artistically inclined, viewing the world as a canvas just waiting for their mental brush to paint. Even when not using their powers, shapers busied themselves with acts of creation, whether it be whittling the wood for some instruments , repairing armor, crafting all manner of items from crystals, or crafting chemicals and reagents like an alchemist .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Shapers almost exclusively utilized powers that fell within the purview of the metacreativity discipline. Their specialization in this discipline allowed shapers to unlock a suite of powers that were unknown to other psions. These powers were as followed â€“ astral construct , astral seed , crystallize , ectoplasmic cocoon and mass ectoplasmic cocoon , greater concealing amorpha , genesis , hail of crystals , psionic fabricate and greater psionic fabricate , psionic minor creation , psionic repair damage , quintessence , and true creation .</p>
<p>In the years following the Spellplague , almost all shapers exhibited the powers psionic minor creation and shaped consciousness .</p>
<p>They often created constructs to fight on their behalf and sought to use their powers in creative ways. To some, the creation of animated constructs was considered the cornerstone of being a shaper.</p>
<p>While some kept a mental list of preconstructed constructs to manifest on a moment's notice, other shapers took a creative bent to their astral constructs, preferring to craft each uniquely as needed. Some shapers even had a specific form of astral construct that they favored above all others.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>While traditionally psionics users such as shapers didn't need any physical tools or weaponry to practice their discipline, following the Spellplague they began using implements to enhance their abilities. Typically these took the form of orbs and staves , through which they would channel their psionic energy into powers.</p>
