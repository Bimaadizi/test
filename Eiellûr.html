<p>Eiellûr was an ancient kingdom of green elves created during the First Flowering in −21,000 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Eiellûr was drawn into the War of Three Leaves against Thearnytaar and Syòrpiir by the actions of assassins and spies from Ilythiir in −17,100 DR .</p>
<p>Eiellûr entered the second Crown War by allying with Thearnytaar and declaring war against Ilythiir after Ilythiir destroyed Syòrpiir with fire in −11,600 DR . The The Sable Wars , which began in −11,450 DR , were a series of battles during the Second Crown War. Aided by a few allies from Keltormir and Shantel Othreier , Eiellûr and Thearnytaar invaded Ilythiir , aiming to reform or conquer the dark elves before they destroyed any more realms. Over half their forces were wiped out by the dark elves' corrupt magic.</p>
<p>Around −11,400 DR , the kingdom was isolated from its allies and destroyed with fire by the dark elves of Ilythiir. The Ilythiiri were aided by treacherous green elves seeking peace through appeasement.</p>
<p>Over the course of time, the ruins of Eiellûr vanished under the forest canopies of the Winterwood .</p>
