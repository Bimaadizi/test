<p>Prince Hubadai Khahan was a Tuigan warrior and the son of Yamun Khahan during the mid 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Standing over six feet tall, Hubadai was powerfully-built, with a scarred, broad face that sported a trim mustache and beard. His eyes were described as 'piercing'.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Hubadai was a strict commander, making him a challenging enemy. He was a loyal friend to those whom he trusted. He valued human life less than commanders from other cultures, allowing him to sacrifice troops in order to achieve his goals. He was a capable leader who was not afraid to join the fighting with his men. The driving force behind all of Hubadai's actions was the desire to please his father. People found him charmingly arrogant, and after his father's death, his motivation was to prove his people's faith in him was not unfounded.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Hubadai owned a suit of magical lamellar armor, a magical sword, a ring of protection , a ring of teleportation , and a helm of reflection . His most prized mount was the great black course Sandiraksiva with whom he formed a partnership during his travels through the lands of Ra-Khati , on his way to attack Khazari .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Hubadai founded the nation of Yaïmmunahar three years after the death of his father, establishing the capital of Kourmira in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Horde War , Hubadai was tasked by his father with the conquest of Semphar , which he accomplished with relative ease. Hubadai enlisted the aid of Semphar's exiled ex-regent, Ali al-Mustasib , while taking his daughter Dura prisoner as a concubine. During her imprisonment, Dura bore Hubadai two sons.</p>
<p>After Semphar, Hubadai was tasked with taking his forces and assault the kingdom of Khazari from the south, travelling with his army through the mountain-lands of Ra-Khati, he encountered both the great horse Sandiraksiva with whom he formed a partnership, and the Ra-Khati princess and heir Tsenya Bhrokiti with whom he married after Khazari had been subdued.</p>
<p>After the Tuigan loss at the conclusion of the Horde War, Hubadai did not immediately return home to the Endless Waste. Instead, he secretly visited several nations and cities over the next three years, including Cormyr , Sembia , Waterdeep , and Zhentil Keep , intending to learn from the people who had defeated his own. He determined that their loss was due to the fact that the Tuigan were not unified as a nation. When he returned home in the Year of the Wyvern, 1363 DR , he declared himself khahan, and founded the nation of Yaïmmunahar. He won the support of the Commani , Naican , and Oigur tribes, then set to work building his new realm.</p>
