<p>Node hieroglyphs were the writing system used by the spellweaver race. Far from a simple alphabet, hieroglyphs were closer to a complex cipher, the meaning of the symbols varying from one document to the other. Sages theorized that this was due to the alien way the spellweaver brain worked, encoding information in complex patterns incomprehensible to other creatures.</p>
<h3>Alphabet</h3>
<p>The spellweaver alphabet was made of at least 29 symbols.</p>
