<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, Shattercrown and his frost giants arrived in Dragonscar Gorge to force the area's goblinoids to excavate the ruins of Thrymstone , and the Chillsparkers likewise found themselves coerced into their service. When members of the Frosthunger Horde tried to flee and escape to Shimmersky Valley , the Chillsparkers led the charge. Once the Valley had been overrun, the Chillsparkers began attacking travelers near the entrance of the Valley.</p>
