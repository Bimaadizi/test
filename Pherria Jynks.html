<p>Pherria Jynks ( pronounced : /ˈ f ɛər i ɑː ˈ dʒ ɪ n ks / FAIR-ee-ah JINX ) was a human acolyte of Torm in Elturel in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Pherria was serving in the High Hall cathedral when the whole city of Elturel was transported to Avernus , first layer of the Nine Hells , in the Year of Twelve Warnings, 1494 DR . As the High Hall was overrun by devils , Pherria took the Tome of the Creed Resolute from the cathedral to safeguard it, and then took shelter in the main crypts with over a hundred other survivors. As the only remaining priest, with no one in authority above her to guide her, she did her best to keep people calm and quiet. There they waited until help came. If they were discovered by friendly adventurers, she would give what news and aid she could. She might've helped exorcise Ulder Ravenguard when he was afflicted by Baphomet and the Helm of Torm's Sight , though she had not performed the specific ritual before.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>She was a sage and expert on possession and exorcism.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She had gray hair and appeared haggard at the time of the ordeal in the crypts. She was armed with only a feeble ceremonial mace .</p>
