<p>Graendel Granitefist was a dwarf smith from Mithral Hall and the proprietor of the Graendel's Fine Dwarven Craft in Targos in Icewind Dale in the 14 th and 15 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Graendel was an old man with graying hair. Despite his age, he was still a powerful smith.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Graendel though that Speaker Kemp of Targos did a reasonable job leading the town, and respected him for leading the town militia in the Battle of Icewind Dale , but still believed the Speaker's council to be nothing but Kemp's cronies.</p>
<p>The old dwarf also did not trust Silvenius Crim , the proprietor of Icewind Enchantments , who arrived to the town and opened a new business in the late 14 th century DR. Graendel did not respect a man who teleported instead of walking.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Graendel forged a variety of metalwork, from pieces of armor to blades for weapons to anchors for the town's fishing boats. He crafted every piece to order and his attention to detail and quality meant they were perfectly fitted to the user's specifications. However, his work was slow as a result, so most people went to one of the regular smiths in Targos for basic tools or quick armor patches. Nevertheless, circa 1485 DR , guards came here all the way from Bryn Shander to get their armor repaired or adjusted and to, unwillingly, hear his stories. When the Clan Battlehammer left Icewind Dale for Mithral Hall , Graendel began doing business with the Clan Firehammer that chose to stay behind. Baldryn Irontooth was one the the Firehammer suppliers that made deliveries of raw materials and other trading goods to Graendel's Fine Dwarven Craft circa 1373 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He hailed from Mithral Hall, but following its fall in the latter half of the 12 th century DR , he he came with Clan Battlehammer and the other refugees to resettle in Icewind Dale. He took up work as a smith and, by the late 15 th century, he had been carrying on his trade in Targos since before the other townsfolk's grandparents were born.</p>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , when strife and a refugee crisis put a stranglehold on Icewind Dale, Graendel met the famed Hero of Neverwinter , who found themselves elbow-deep in these grim events. He was already aware of the Hero's name as trade caravans from Neverwinter did bring the news of the previous year's Wailing Death and a war between Luskan and Neverwinter. The old smith planned on creating several powerful enchanted items before getting too old and though that entrusting them to the Hero would ensure his work would not be forgotten. With the Hero's help, Graendel may have had several of those items completed: a mage's staff called Kossuth's Fury , a cloak of the yeti mades out of an abominable yeti 's hide, Thunder Clap bracers , a piece of armor called weapon master's scale , and spear of the mammoth .</p>
<p>By that time, Graendel was the last living witness in town to Akar Kessell 's destructive attack on Targos with a beam from Cryshal-Tirith and the occupation by his forces, in the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR . The aged dwarf would still tell the story of that time, usually to customers who could go nowhere else.</p>
