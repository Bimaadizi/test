<p>Chimera-spawn were mutant chimeras , known only in the Stonelands .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These mutant chimeras were covered in serpent-scales and had a single central lion's head, flanked with two dragon heads.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Per eyewitnesses, chimera-spawn were recklessly aggressive.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>One of the chimera-spawn's heads breathed fire, and the other one breathed electricity. They were otherwise rather similar to existing chimeras, with only a few differences.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Besides its twin breath weapons, the chimera-spawn's serpentine draconic scales covered its whole body, making it that much tougher and giving it far fewer weak spots. The creature was also slightly hardier than a regular chimera.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Chimerae of the Stonelands sometimes gave birth to chimera-spawn when both sire and mare were chimerae. The resulting mutants lived generally short lives, as they were too aggressive for their own good.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Per the adventuring wizard Maris Khorna Terrabin , these creatures were found only in the Stonelands. She'd only ever seen one personally, and it was dead after it accidentally collapsed a cave on itself during a fight.</p>
