<p>Riordan Parnell was a half-elf bard and a member of Spysong . He was one of Gareth Dragonsbane 's companions in the War of Bloodstone , and was instrumental to the defeat of Zhengyi the Witch-King .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Riordan was lithe of build and was regarded as quite handsome. He looked remarkably young for his age, even for a half-elf.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Riordan was an extraordinary bard, whose ability to coax the truth from reluctant witnesses helped him greatly in his position as a scout for Spysong.</p>
<p>His favorite instrument was the lute . When playing and singing, Riordan slipped enchantments into his tunes and used the magic of his voice—the gift of true bards—to manipulate the mood of his subjects, convincing them of his friendship and trustworthiness.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , Riordan helped to found Spysong, an intelligence organization working on behalf of the kingdom of Damara . With the help of some fifteen bards around Vaasa and Damara, Riordan coded important messages for Gareth Dragonsbane into songs. Also, Riordan had a mobile strike force of 100 fighters under his exclusive command, which included 20 centaur cavalrymen.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR , the aged Riordan was the sole leader of Spysong, but was then working against the ruler of Damara, King Yarin Frostmantle , whom he suspected of having assassinated the last of Gareth Dragonsbane's descendants.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Riordan was close allies with King Gareth Dragonsbane of Damara and their fellow adventuring companions from before Gareth became king. One of these fellow adventurers, Celedon Kearney , was Riordan's cousin, with whom he founded the safe haven of the Cave of the Whispering Wind in the Galena Mountains .</p>
