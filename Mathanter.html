<p>Mathanter of Sembia was a member of the Rightful Conspiracy in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Marsember meeting of the Rightful Conspiracy in early spring of 1373Â DR , Mathanter of Sembia had left an impression on Narnra Shalace by bringing over a half dozen of sellswords with him. This made her remember his name later, when the War Wizards raided the premises; she tried to pass herself off as one of their allies by naming Mathanter as one of the people present earlier.</p>
