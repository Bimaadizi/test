<p>Romantic Dreams Forays was an entertainment business based in the small village of Halfcrag in the 14 th century DR , operated entirely by a band of semi-retired female adventurers , that gave patrons the experience of being an adventurer through a largely pre-planned theatrical excursion.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Foray charged a stiff fee for its excursions, an advanced fee of 50 gold pieces ; they were once given a rating of by Volothamp Geddarm on his rating system . Their resultant clientele were often wealthy Sembians seeking some excitement. They even received repeat customers, who enjoyed the outings regardless of whether or not they figured out how staged everything was.</p>
<p>The Foray experience began in a steep-sided dell, out of sight of Halfcrag, wherein patrons would be fitted for equipment and put through some relaxed weapon training. As evening rolled around a campfire would be started and a number of alcoholic beverages would be offered to patrons. Around the fire Foray guides would tell their patrons scary stories of dangers that lurked around the nearby Dun Hills .</p>
<p>At dawn the clientele and their Foray guides would ride out on horseback , either on the most scenic trails or into the very heart of the highest hill, and encounter an ample supply of monster tracks that had been laid yesterday by other members of the company. The group would then be attacked by two creatures that had likewise been pre-arranged by the Foray guides, a de venomed serpent and a stirge whose wings were clipped, to give the customers "monster trophies" to take home. Afterwards the guides would bring the band of "adventurers" to a hidden pond to rest and unwind with a swim, as well as a relaxed highsun meal. And for those clients whom the guides found to be attractive enough, they would some amorous advances â€“ according to Volothamp, Foray guide Anjanna told him this was what constituted the "dreams" part of their company's name.</p>
<p>Once well rested, the band's monster trophies would be secured to their saddles and make their way to exploring a nearby ruin, the crumbling remains of an ancient keep. Upon a staircase within this keep laid bones, allegedly belonging to fallen warriors , and a handful of coins that the Foray guides had scattered amongst them a day prior. At that point a prepared illusion spell would be triggered, projecting a menacing ghostly visage. The guides would refer to it as being a "mythical deathghost" and warn their patrons to stay back, saying they "have not the magic to defeat it", and demonstrate how it goes unfazed by turn undead .</p>
<p>As the Foray band inevitably made a retreat from the ruined keep, an illusion of a snarling wyvern would swoop down at them. The retreat would bring them rushing into a valley, where an illusion of sixteen masked bandits would ambush them, charging forth with shouts of a challenge. The Foray band would not engage with the outlaws, whose illusion was set up to never actually catch the fleeing "adventurers". At last the company would make a triumphant return to their campground at the base of Halfcrag, just in time to enjoy evenfeast.</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>Whenever the Foray guides recognized one or more of those signed up for an excursion were prior patrons, they would try to vary up their scripted encounters. The women were also more then prepared to handle rogues or actual monsters wandering into their set route, as happened on ocassion.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The membership of the Romantic Dreams Forays was made up rather attractive human and half-elven women who had partially retired from life as adventurers. Whenever they went out on one of their tours members carried a robe of useful items , as well as a bountiful supply of elixirs of health and potions of healing .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Volothamp Geddarm visited with the members of Romantic Dreams Forays in his travels across the Dalelands , they recounted one incident in which a pair of firedrakes pounced upon them. A guide was badly injured and the jaded Sembian patrons in their company uproariously lunged at the dragonets , slaughtering them with reckless abandon.</p>
