<p>Kaymendle Skrip was a bumbling Sembian wizard, responsible for magicks that altered the weather in Cormyr as of the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The well-meaning wizard was difficult to deter, but skulked away after his first failure.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>While his more traditional abilities were not known, Kaymendle was responsible for Kaymendle's dog and Kaymendle bolts .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kaymendle Skrip was hired in Southern Harrowdale to find a solution to the occassional torrential downpours; he created an apparition resembling a dog, which he believed could scare clouds away by barking. This apparition, Kaymendle's dog, failed to perform; its barking had no effect on the rain or trajectory of any clouds.</p>
<p>He was later hired in the Thunder Peaks , north of the Hullack Forest . There, he attempted to mitigate lightning bolt damage to farms by making the bolts of lightning so heavy that they would fall without causing any damage. The Kaymendle bolts were a mixed success; while indeed some bolts of lightning fell too quickly due to their weight, they became continuing hazards, and he was chased away.</p>
<p>Kaymendle eventually retired to a secluded laboratory in the Arch Wood in the late mid-14 th century DR.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>As of the late mid-14 th century DR , Kaymendle was said to be working on elastic snow that bounced back after falling.</p>
