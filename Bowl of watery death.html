<p>A bowl of watery death was a cursed magical item that drowned wizards who used it.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Indistinguishable from a bowl of commanding water elementals , the bowl of watery death was a bowl 1 foot (30 centimeters) across, half that much deep, made of semi-precious stones such as malachite , lapis lazuli , or sometimes jade .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When a wizard filled the bowl with water, it responded by shrinking them to the size of an ant and plunging them into its depths, where it would immediately begin to drown them. The target was magically prevented from leaving the bowl or stopping their drowning; only a few magics, such as enlarge , animal growth or wish could rescue the victim. Dropping a potion of growth into the bowl also saved the target, while a potion of sweet water allowed the victim another opportunity to thwart the power of the bowl. Victims drowned by the bowl were irrevocably gone, even to wish spells.</p>
<p>If used in the Nine Hells , the subject was raised as a lemure within 10 hours.</p>
<p>Saltwater only made the magic more aggressive.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>One such bowl was the only enchanted item among the wares in an abandoned shop selling grotesque-looking bowls in the Imaskari ruins underneath Solon in the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR . Similar magic was used in one of the trials of Red Mountain Monastery .</p>
<p>These devices were known in Zakhara .</p>
