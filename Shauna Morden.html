<p>Shauna Morden was the proprietor of the Tavern of the Garden , an establishment located in the Sixstar neighborhood of Ravens Bluff in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In her twenties, in the late 14 th century DR, Shauna was a good-looking and charismatic young woman with large blue eyes. She had black hair cut at the shoulder and dark skin. Shauna wore simple yet elegant gowns.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Shauna inherited the Morden family estate that included the Tavern of the Garden eatery, several buildings in Ravens Bluff, and a winery just southeast of the village of Dragon Falls . She also was the producer of the Tavern of the Garden wine variety sold at her eatery.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Shauna was born to Charles Morden, a successful decorative gardener who gained wealth and renown by working for nobles and merchants. Her father was a serious and religious man, while her mother was a drunkard who left Charles and very young Shauna. Throughout her childhood, Shauna apprenticed and later worked alongside her father as a gardener.</p>
<p>When Charles died of natural causes at the age of eighty-three, circa the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , soon after The Three Women War ended, Shauna inherited a small estate that included the Tavern of the Garden, a small winery in Ravens Bluff and another vinery in a spring-shore valley outside the Dragon Falls.</p>
<p>Shauna eagerly took over the business and aimed to make it a success. She renovated the Tavern of the Garden and was eager to find out more about the Dragon Falls winery that was kept a secret from her by Charles, likely due to his disdain for alcohol over Shauna's drunkard mother. The young woman hosted a grand re-opening of the Tavern of the Garden – an evening of free food and drinks in hopes of securing Ravenaar patronage. During the re-opening, Shauna personally greeted arriving guests and individuals in line for admission, playing the role of a hostess. During the event, the woman gathered a group of adventurers of the Living City and offered them a lucrative job – to investigate the family vinery outside Dragon Falls. She wanted to have it running, producing wine for the eatery, or getting in contact with its current managers, whom she did not know. Subsequently, the adventurers discovered its master vintner – maedar Vorlon , who had claimed the vinery a decade prior. It was believed that the heroes negotiated Shauna and maedar's cooperation and profitable future together and escorted the woman to visit the winery in person. However, some accounts claimed the adventurers slew the maedar and his greater medusa mate instead of allowing them to run the winery.</p>
