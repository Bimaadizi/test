<p>Hayashiro was a village located in Miyama Province in Kozakura .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hayashiro was once a small yet thriving village.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Kozakuran Year 1428 (1354 DR) , creatures descending from the nearby mountains led a devastating attack on the village. During a violent nocturnal raid, the invaders massacred the inhabitants, plundered the properties, and ignited fires across the village. The onset of a midnight rainstorm prevented the complete destruction of the village by preserving a few buildings.</p>
<p>Despite the widespread ruin, two individuals miraculously survived the massacre: a young boy and a man who had been absent from the village that fateful night. Having formed a bond in the aftermath, they resided together in one of the surviving, albeit damaged, dwellings as of Kozakuran Year 1430 (1356 DR) .</p>
