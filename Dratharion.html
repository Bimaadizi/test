<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Captain Dratharion was a muscular tall man with short blond hair, an eyepatch over his left eye, and an arrogant contemptuous smile. His one good eye was of a dark color. His facial expression and body language showed him as being a seasoned fighter.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Captain Dratharion was irritable man who often dismissed questions that annoyed him or just wasted his valuable time. He was also an extremely sarcastic person who would mock anyone who he deemed insignificant.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1372 Dr, Captain Dratharion was allied with Matagar Bugo in their plan to take over leadership of Daggerford via kidnapping Duke Pwyll Daggerford and instating a puppet leader, loyal to Zhentarim . Dratharion was brought in alongside his mercenary company, the Griffons, to secure the city of Daggerford in the lieu of recent increased bandit activities along the Trade Way (also organized by the Zhentarim). The Griffons under Dratharion's command were to become the "Trojan Horse" when the evil scheme was to reach its crescendo.</p>
<p>Shortly after one of the caravan attack survivors arrived to Daggerford, the person later to become the Hero of Daggerford , Captain Dratharion ordered the gates to the city to be locked, as we claimed a dangerous criminal named Wikkers escaped the Castle Daggerford's dungeons. The captain claimed the escapee was a dangerous lunatic and a murderer, and ordered everyone to ignore his slanderous ravings. Eventually, the lockdown was lifter after Dratharion's Griffons caught the man and executed him on the streets of the city, which was witnessed by the Hero of Daggerford. The mercenaries searched Wikkers' body for a certain book with sensitive information and rushed off to inform Dratharion of the deed.</p>
