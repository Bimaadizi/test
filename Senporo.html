<p>Senporo was one of the many isolated villages of the Fochu Peninsula in Wa . It was little more than a hiding place for outcasts and brigands.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The people of Senporo were suspicious of strangers and not at all welcoming. The hamlet had a population of about 110 individuals after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR) . These lived among a collection of a few small shacks. There was only a single inn in the village.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Senporo was located at the northern end of the Fochu Peninsula, where it connected to the mainland of Tsukishima . It sat in the foothills of the Jufosu Mountains .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Villages in Wa were run by an administrator known as a shoya , typically a minor samurai , and Senporo was no different in this respect. The shoya of Senporo after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR) was Moti Kaihogh , who was also the settlement's only innkeeper and bartender.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Like the other tiny settlements of the region, Senporo had little contact with the other villages, much less with the rest of Kara-Tur or regions beyond.</p>
<p>The village had no production to speak of and had nothing to sell. A drink of corn sake at the inn cost 1 fen per glass or 3 yuan per jar. A night in the inn cost 2 or 3 fen , but it was risky to stay there, as patrons might find themselves robbed in the night.</p>
<h2>Religion</h2>
<p>Unlike the other settlements in the region, the people of Senporo were not particularly religious.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed coiled dragon Za-Jikku began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical butterflies, the breath of which would create yun ch'i , the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever.</p>
