<p>Elthryn Aumar was one of the Warring Princes of Athalantar and the father of Elminster Aumar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Elthryn was a calm, peaceful, just man. At one point, not supporting the intrigues that plagued the court, Elthryn retired to the outlying village of Heldon and Uthgrael Aumar gave him the Lion Sword , a longsword with magical powers that had never left the king's hand until then. Some saw this act as the king appointing Elthryn as the true heir to the Stag Throne.</p>
<p>In Heldon, Elthryn married a forester's daughter, Amrythale Goldsheaf , in 210 DR . They had one son, Elminster, born in 212 DR . Both parents were slain in the destruction of Heldon by the wizard Undarl in 224 DR .</p>
