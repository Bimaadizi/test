<p>Hammershaws was a village near Felmorel in the mid–8 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Laughter, 761 DR , Elminster Aumar , a Chosen of Mystra , crossed Hammershaws whilst seeking Dasumia , the Lady of Shadows, at the command of Mystra . He found no one in the village, and nothing but picked bones along the main street. Some of the bones inside a house were still sitting as if they'd died in that position. The stone hedges were overgrown, some roofs were collapsed, and there was at least one wolf -like creature lairing inside one of the houses, indicating that the place had been abandoned for some time.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Though Elminster assumed the killing had been done by the Lady of Shadows, he never got firm confirmation of the fact.</p>
