<p>A fey lingerer , sometimes known as simply a lingerer , was the undead remnant of a fey or eladrin that refused to die. They were animated by strong emotions, passions, or simply spite that their long lifespan had been cut short.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The physical form of a fey lingerer was zombielike and ruined, but driven by a violent spirit . Their features were skeletal, but in darkness or from a distance, they could still appear delicate and beautiful as they had in life. However, their moldy or slimy clothing and armor could give them away. When injured, their blood was yellow.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Fey lingerers were necessarily strong-willed in order to reject their deaths, and generally were animated by their passions, obsessions, or strong negative emotions of hatred, malice, or vengeance against those responsible for killing them. Lingerers were twisted and depraved, having lost all the grace and manners of their living selves. They lashed out violently against any who challenged them, especially those who appeared young or full of life.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Fey lingerers fought ferociously and with little concern for their own preservation. They retained some of the martial or spellcasting abilities they had in life, and lashed out with necrotic magic .</p>
<p>If slain, a fey lingerer's spirit immediately manifested as a flying incorporeal vestige capable of short-distance teleportation . These vestiges continued to attack their enemies in a vengeful frenzy. The vestiges of warriors manifested ghostly swords while the vestiges of spellcasters fired magical rays.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Lingering warriors were often motivated to relive their past glories or to accomplish an unfinished task, and fought with rage and desperation. Lingering spellcasters sought to rediscover lost lore or spells , and were suffused with despair.</p>
<p>Fey lingerers sometimes congregated in groups not far from where living fey or eladrin resided, notably in the Winterglen forest of Sarifal nearby to Citadel Umbra . They were sometimes accompanied by loyal living eladrin, elves , or bralani allies, and other times were encountered alongside their fellow undead.</p>
