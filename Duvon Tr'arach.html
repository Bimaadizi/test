<p>Duvon Tr'arach , later known as Avinvesa Fey , was a drow weapon master in Menzoberranzan in the early 11 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>Duvon hailed from House Tr'arach , a small house.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Dracorage, 1018 DR , Duvon, together with Matron Mother Hauzz Tr'arach and his sister Daungelina Tr'arach , planned an attack on House Simfray . The first priestess reassured Hauzz about the wizards they had hired from House Xorlarrin and Duvon about the presumably very talented Simfray weapon master Zaknafein .</p>
<p>During the attack, Daungelina and Duvon confronted Zaknafein but the enemy weapon master easily defeated Duvon and later, with a few quick actions, also killed Daungelina. Duvon was on the verge of being killed by his giant lizard mount when Jarlaxle saved and sedated him.</p>
<p>Afterward, with Duvon's blessing, Jarlaxle sold him to House Fey-Branche to be their new weapon master until one of the children of Matron Byrtyn Fey proved adept at the job. He remained in that position until 1118 DR .</p>
<p>However, Duvon was still resentful of Zaknafein and Matron Byrtyn and, that year, her daughter Affyn Fey started to plot Zak's death using Duvon. A few days later, Duvon tried to kill Zaknafein inside the Oozing Myconid , with the support of Harbondair Tr'arach , but was stopped by Jarlaxle, who proposed to set up a regular duel soon.</p>
<p>On the day of the duel, which had attracted many noble gamblers, Duvon had his great fight with Zak. However, thanks to a little support from Jarlaxle, Zaknafein ultimately gained supremacy and Duvon surrendered. After the defeat, Jarlaxle traded with Matron Byrtyn to have Duvon dismissed by House Fey-Branche and, following a sojourn in Ched Nasad in the Year of the Sharn Suitors, 1119 DR , he formally joined Bregan D'aerthe .</p>
