<p>Presman Taliemin was an Oghmanyte high priest in the city-state of Saelmur , in the Land of the Lions region of south Faer√ªn , in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Presman served as the high priest of Saelmur's local temple of Oghma, the Library of the Binder . And like Saelmur's other religious leaders, he also served as a member of the city-state's governing council, the Councilium of Prelates .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1370 DR , Presman was frequently being pressured by his clergy to rally aid to the Oghmanytes who were operating a resistance movement in Mintar against the Knights of the Black Gauntlet , an order of Banite crusaders who had conquered and occupied that neighboring city-state since the Year of the Helm, 1362 DR . But unlike some of his fellow Prelates, Presman was undecided on the matter of whether Saelmur should engage the Knights' forces in war sooner or later.</p>
