<p>Princess Wei Dao was a member of the imperial royal family of Shou Lung , who lived in the Shou embassy in the Eastern Heartlands of Faerûn during the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>While Wei Dao had a small frame she was athletic, graceful, and quite striking. She had dark eyes set above high cheek bones and decorated herself in the finest cosmetics.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was an ambitious woman who continuously strove with her husband to improve their lot in life, and their standing with Emperor Kao Tsao Shou Tang .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Wei Dao was an adept courtier and capable of masking her intent and emotions to the residents of the Heartlands.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Princess Wei Dao was married to Kao Chou Tang , son of the Emperor of Shou Lung . The two shared an unharmonious relationship, in which Wei Dao would regularly urge Tang to take bold action as befitting a prince, while simultaneously undercutting his decisions and compromising his authority. She then performed unknown acts of penance for her actions, which were apparently expected of her.</p>
<p>She had a working relationship with the dwarf Abazm , who would regularly bring select merchants to her home at the Ginger Palace .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>When Prince Tang inadvertently became involved with the Cult of the Dragon , and wound up being manipulated by the devious group, Wei Dao offered her support. While he was coerced into smuggling poisons for them, following the abduction of his mother Lady Feng , Lady Feng personally involved herself in their operations, maintaining connections with a spy within the ranks of the local law enforcement, the Maces of Elversult .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point in their lives, Princess Wei Dao and Prince Tang were sent away from their home in Tai Tung to the far-off Dragon Coast in Faerûn . They each came to resent their lives in what they called the "barbarian" lands, and wished nothing more than to return home.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR , the Princess accepted into the Ginger Palace Abazm and his client Ruha , a sorceress from the Anauroch desert. In exchange for admittance, the pair gifted Wei Dao a chest of gold and a single coin from Calimshan , that held within it a secret message from her Dragon Cult spy from Elversult . The message falsely stating that Ruha was an assassin and should not be trusted. Wei Dao immediately began investigating Ruha, nearly catching her snooping around the apartment of Tang's mother Lady Feng, who had been recently been abducted by Cypress the Black , the patron of the Dragon Cult. Ruha's presence at the embassy led to fights between Wei Dao and Prince Tang, as the prince wanted to make Ruha his next concubine and employ her as a wu jen .</p>
<p>Minister Hsieh Han Liu finally arrived at the Ginger Palace, after his sea voyage aboard the Ginger Lady was delayed due to an attack at sea by Cypress. During their initial meeting, Wei Dao lied to the minister about Lady Feng's disappearance at the hands of the cult in order to hide her involvement with the group. Troubled by the growing dynamic, Wei Dao harried Tang until he imprisoned Ruha in the dungeon beneath the palace.</p>
<p>The dracolich Cypress appeared at the Ginger Palace and confronted Ruha for her intrusion into the activities of the Dragon Cult. After Wei Dao and Prince Tang arrived to greet Cypress, the princess once again let her anger get the better of her, publicly chastised her husband and called him mad before their undead master. The infringement of his authority infuriated Prince Tang to no end and further drove a wedge between their relationship.</p>
<p>After a brief absence, Minister Hsieh returned to the palace to coordinate a negotiation between Prince Tang, Princess Wei Dao, and Ruha, to arrange for the sorceress's release to Vaerana Hawklyn . During the talks, Hsieh pressed Wei Dao into fully committing to her previous lie, insisting Ruha was an assassin that should not be trusted. As Ruha prepared to reveal the truth about Lady Feng's disappearance, Wei Dao turned on the Bedine spellcaster and nearly killed her with a dagger . With lightning alacrity, Minister Hsieh intercepted the attack, subdued Wei Dao, and had her secured in her own apartment. . When it was revealed Wei Dao was informed Cypress about Minister Hsieh's presence aboard the Ginger Lady , she lost the confidence and trust of Prince Tang, despite remaining a Princess of Shou Lung.</p>
