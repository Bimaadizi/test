<p>The Cormal family was a noble house of Tethyr that held the throne under the Shoon Imperium , becoming the second of the Shoon Traitorum dynasties.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The house came to royal prestige when King Amahl Shoon III dispensed with his lesser titles upon his own inheritance of the Calimshan Empire . He granted the rule of Tethyr to his brother-in-law, Rahman Cormal , who proceeded to loyally rule the realm as his vassal. The Cormals endured for two whole centuries, although the family tree eventually thinned until the death of the childless King Emyr resulted in the monarchy passing to his unrelated vizier, Matamid Korrunhel , who went on to found the Korrunhel Dynasty .</p>
