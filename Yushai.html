<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Yushai was a green-hued deinonychus with a bright green underside. Despite being a ferocious predator, Yushai behaved more akin to a loyal dog, regularly looking up at his master with puppy-like eyes, looking for affection and approval.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Yushai accompanied its master Umoja to the jungles of Samarach and into the city of Samargol . His deity guided the druid to combat the growing threat of the yuan-ti deity. The duo stayed at the Openpalm Bazar in Samargol and offered healing to a group of adventurers who were survivors of the Vigilant . When Umoja accompanied the group on their adventures into the jungles, and later back to the Sword Coast , Umoja instructed his dinosaur companion to remain in the Samarachan jungles until he returned.</p>
