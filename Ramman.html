<p>Ramman was an ancient Untheric deity of war and storms.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ramman led Unther to its first victories as a strong and fair champion. He led Unther in battle against the Imaskari and defended Unther during the Orcgate Wars . Later, around the 400's DR , Ramman joined Gilgeam in Unther and drove out the rival storm deity Assuran .</p>
<p>During the Time of Troubles , Assuran appeared on Toril in Akanax , taking the body of King Hippartes of Chessenta as his avatar. He would lead an army into Unther, seeking to pay Ramman back. As their forces fought and their avatars went toe-to-toe, Ramman sent out a thunderous lightning attack on Assuran. With a powerful spell Assuran sent the lightning rebounding back to the storm god. Before Assuran could seize his portfolio from the dying god, Ramman passed it on to Anhur , the Mulhorandi god of warfare.</p>
<p>In the midst of his death, thirteen of Ramman's scouts were drenched in his blood and absorbed some of his power, becoming spellthieves . They later came together and formed an organization known as Fallen Justice .</p>
