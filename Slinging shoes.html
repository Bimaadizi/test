<p>Slinging shoes were a pair of enchanted boots with some hits of sentience, created some time before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Slinging shoes possessed a simple enchantment that returned the boots back to their owner's feet. However, somehow, these boots showed a genius streak by kicking their owner in the ankles every time they wore slippers or high-heeled shoes. Unexpectedly, the same enchantment that made them return also made them a good thrown weapon, and when the boots hit a target, they dealt additional psychic damage. While wearing the boots, the wearer also gained a slight boost to their nimbleness and reaction.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a pair of such slinging shoes belonged to Tara , a tressym companion of the Waterdhavian mage Gale Dekarios , who followed him to the city of Baldur's Gate during the Absolute crisis . She was ready to exchange the boots with a face friendly to Gale in exchange for some fresh fish .</p>
