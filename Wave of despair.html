<p>The wave of despair was a magical bastard sword provided by the demon lord Graz'zt when he visited the mines of Tethyamar in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The long sword had a wavy shape that ended in a sharp hook-like point, making it resemble his personal sword Angdrelve . The whole blade glowed an unpleasant purple color.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The bastard sword had deeply unpleasant and lethal qualities imbued as it imitated Angdrelve . It dripped a deadly acid , left unnaturally deep wounds, and was strongly chaotic . A dark force within it occasionally reached out to living creatures and attempted to snuff out their life force all at once.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Wave of despair was a mundane blade that was transformed by the will of Graz'zt into something stranger. It was left behind by Graz'zt after his schemes with the jewels of ardor in the ruins of Tethyamar were uncovered. He intentionally provided the bastard sword to his foes as a prize before quitting the fight and voluntarily leaving.</p>
