<p>The Great Oak was a magical tree that existed in Kuldahar . It was the reason that Kuldahar was in a state of eternal summer and had no trace of snow, unlike the surrounding areas. When linked with the Heartstone Gem , it could radiate a large circle of warmth.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thousands of years before, the great oak was once a divine seed. On the plateau near the tree stood a yuan-ti outpost. The yuan-ti took interest in the spot which the Great Oak grew, as it was the gateway to a distant land.</p>
<p>When Kuldahar was invaded in the early 14 th century, the tree was repeatedly hacked by the brutal yuan-ti. They managed to destroy several of the Great Oak's roots. The archdruid Iselore stayed to protect it.</p>
<p>The yuan-ti managed to find a crossroad portal , from one of the tree's severed roots, to Chult . They planned to use this portal to send through troops and assault Kuldahar. This plan never came to fruition, as the yuan-ti forces were either wiped out at their temple in Chult, or their crossroad guardian was destroyed.</p>
