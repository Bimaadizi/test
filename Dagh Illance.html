<p>Dagh Illance was a knight and a member of the Illance noble family in Cormyr who rode with Alusair Obarskyr .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was hot tempered and battle-hungry, but Alusair thought him a fool like Martin Illance and the rest of their family.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Alusair and her knights were operating in the Stonelands, pursuing a bold orc band that had raided a caravan east of Eveningstar ; in six days of pursuit, they'd killed a hydra , a " fire lizard ", and three chimeras . They were on a high meadow north of Startop Crag when they sighted the orcs; Dagh was the first to hurl a spear and the knights impetuously pursued the orcs into an ambush. Their dark naga master hurled a lightning bolt and Dagh and a few others were killed, before Alusair rallied her forces to defeat their foes. She muttered "good riddance to Illance".</p>
