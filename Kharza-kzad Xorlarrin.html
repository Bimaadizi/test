<p>Kharza-kzad Xorlarrin was a drow and a master of Sorcere before he turned himself into a lich .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In life, Kharza-kzad was described as thin with protruding eyes.</p>
<p>He lived in the Spelltower in the Citadel of Xorlarrin .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During his lifetime, he was famous for creating battle wands and being a master of Sorcere . He was also the last unofficial tutor of Liriel Baenre .</p>
<p>In 1361 DR , soon after Liriel left the city, he was attacked in the Spelltower by Nisstyre , leader of the Dragon's Hoard . Despite being undeniably powerful in the Art, he didn't have any actual experience in battle, which Nisstyre took into account when planning his demise. He was brought to the top of an active volcano, where he fought with Nisstyre in a wizarding duel, but before he dying, he used one of his own creations, a wand of lichdom . With this, he was turned into a lichdrow and was therefore too powerful for the other mage. Nisstyre fled the duel, leaving the lich undestroyed.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h3>Relatives</h3>
<p>Kharza-kzad was the brother of matron mother Zeerith Q'Xorlarrin .</p>
<h3>Liriel Baenre</h3>
<p>He had a relationship with his student Liriel Baenre that was atypical of most drow, since he seemed to truly care about her welfare. Sometimes she brought him things from her adventures in the Underdark , like the scales of a deep dragon . They both shared the profit of selling them. To get her magic and books from the surface, he had connections to the Dragon's Hoard and their leader, Nisstyre. When Liriel was in grave danger, Kharza-kzad refused to kill her, and in fact helped her to escape Menzoberranzan . It was this refusal that led him into the duel with Nisstyre in which Kharza-kzad became a lich.</p>
