<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She was never far from Belarla , and she knew Mirt . She also knew the way to Myrintara 's home.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Oelaerone's work as a Harper and a pleasure queen of Zhentil Keep continued until the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , when Mirt called upon them to aid Shandril Shessair after her first assault on the Citadel of the Raven . They followed her afterwards when she set out to attack the Wizards' Tower . When she was prevented from reaching that location by the patrols in the city, Oelaerone guided Mirt to a passage across the sewers, through which they reached Myrintara's home.</p>
<p>Myrintara later transported them to the Lonesome Tankard in Eveningstar . There, she argued in favor of Shandril striking again at the Zhents, rather that fleeing to Silverymoon . During the tussle with the forces of Fzoul Chembryl at the Wizards' Tower, Oelaerone was struck by a poisoned arrow, taking her out of the fight. She survived the fight, however, and was healed by a kiss from Shandril and her spellfire , getting well enough to leave on her own power soon after.</p>
