<p>The Everhorde was a tremendous, illithid -led humanoid army that rampaged across the Sword Coast in the early 7 th century DR , engulfing several of the human and demihuman kingdoms of the North in war.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The name "Everhorde" was an exonym, created by the people the horde fought against and propagated in stories by bards . The bulk of its army was composed of orcs , though the Everhorde also included ogres and giants .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The forces of the Everhorde were amassed in the Year of the Normiir, 611 DR , sometime prior to the month of Mirtul , within the caverns of the Spine of the World mountain range. That same year, during the spring season, the Everhorde made itself known to the people of the Sword Coast as its forces streamed out from the mountains and waged a war that would ultimately shatter the Illuskans ' dominance over the Sword Coast North . They besieged the ancient city of Illusk , leaving it in ruins. The Everhorde then made its way east, north of the Delimbiyr Vale , claiming countless hamlets, including Droversford , Mnarsvale , and Suthcliff . Eventually they besieged the kingdom of Yarlith , who could not hold back the Everhorde with its small army, leaving it too in ruins.</p>
<p>The kingdoms of Phalorm , Uthtower , and other allied realms further south rushed their armies northward to respond to the Everhorde. Though too late to avert the destruction of Yarlith, the armies managed to arrive in time to lift the Everhorde's siege of the independent trading city of Neverwinter . Backed by the might of the gold dragon Palarandusk , the Everhorde was at last repelled.</p>
<p>By Mirtul 26 , 611 DR, the Everhorde had made its way down to Deepwater Bay and the vampire wizard Palron Kaeth manipulated them into attacking the hidden enclave of Miyeritar .</p>
<p>Over the course of the next year, the Year of the Jester's Smile, 612 DR , the North was engulfed in countless battle after battle, its human and demihuman kingdoms and communities fighting desperately to defeat the Everhorde. The decisive blow against the Everhorde would be struck at the Battle of Firetears , south of the site of where Triboar would one day stand. There the armies Phalorm its allies in the North crushed the Everhorde, though at great cost of lives that left the kingdom gravely weakened. Foremost amongst the casualties was King Lathlaeril "Leafspear", ruler of Ardeep , one of the three kingdoms that made up the triumvirate alliance that was Phalorm.</p>
<p>The armies of Uthtower, greatly shrunken from the war, immediately made their way back to their own kingdom. Phalorm's armies chose to remain in the region for the next two years, fighting to wipe out the smaller orc bands into which the Everhorde had fragmented. This left the kingdom weak to attacks by two separate orc hordes, culminating in the pillaging of Dolblunde and the death of its king, Oskilar Ironaxe .</p>
