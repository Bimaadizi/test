<p>The Sashenstars were a noble family of Baldur's Gate that had a long association with the city's Merchant's League .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>They owed their considerable wealth to their interests in commercial shipping, mining operations, and the textiles industry.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Staring around the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , and continuing on to the Iron crisis that afflicted the Sword Coast in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , the Merchant's League was to compete with the rising Iron Throne mercantile group. The noble family even allowed their Baldurian estate, overseen by Aldeth Sashenstar, to be infiltrated by a group of Throne-controlled doppelgangers . As a result, the city's Council of Four banned the Merchant's League from operating in Baldur's Gate entirely. While the Sashenstar family renounced the organization in public, they maintained a working relationship with the league in secret.</p>
<p>House Sashenstar experienced years of decline until the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , when the family's prodigal son Dabron Sashenstar returned from an expedition to Sossal , took over leadership of the family's businesses, and brought down the Iron Throne with the blessing from the Baldurian Council of Four .</p>
