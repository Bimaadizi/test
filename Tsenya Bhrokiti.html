The raja of Solon Ambuchar Devayam demanded Tsenya's hand in marriage else he would invade the kingdom, and after many trials and tribulations she encountered Hubadai and his 10,000 Tuigan on their way to Khazari to support his father Yamun Khahan , though they started off wary of each other they eventually fell in love. As the armies of Solon marched upon Ra-Khati, Hubadai pleaded with his father to ride to the beleaguered kingdoms aid to convince her father to accept their marriage.</p>
