<p>Do'dzin Gompa was a monastery (a gompa in the Tabotan language ) of the Way of Enlightenment in Tabot . It was surrounded by a city of the same name. The monastery's symbol was a hawk .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Do'dzin Gompa stood amongst the northern foothills of the lower Haraki Ridge in central Tabot, southeast of Chophon .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Over the holiest shrine in the monastery was a solid gold hawk with wings outstretched.</p>
<p>At the heart of the monastery compound were a number of fig trees.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was founded some time between Shou Year 585 (−665 DR) and Shou Year 640 (−610 DR) , when fifteen groups of monks and temple guardians escaped persecution in Shou Lung and journeyed southwest in search of a holy land that would remain pure and lasting, ideal for isolated hermitages. One of these groups built the beginnings of Do'dzin.</p>
<p>In Shou Year 2311 (1061 DR) , a shepherd found the infant H'Dang Li in the wastelands just north of the Haraki Ridge and brought him to the lamas of Do'dzin Gompa, where he would be raised and educated. The monks saw the child as pure, born enlightened, and fully at one with the Celestial Heavens , as well as highly intelligent and capable of magical powers. Before long, the holy boy was recognized by all the monasteries, which were reformed and united under the rule of the High Lord of Oceans.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>It was considered important among the gompas, for it was where the first High Lord was raised. Pokarr Gompa sent delegations to four of its annual festivals, including Mo Kin , Abbot of Pokarr.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The surrounding city was home to 1,400 laymen, while the monastery itself housed 600 lamas.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The lamas harvested the figs and from these brewed a potent alcohol known as mujahroom .</p>
<p>Do'dzin Gompa held at least four festivals a year. These included a performance of a play called the Whi-yeu Nohg to commemorate the first High Lord. Another was Penance Day ; on the eve, participants were temporarily released from all their vows and drank mujahroom and engaged in other indiscretions—penance came the morning after.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Do'dzin Gompa was said to be haunted by a ghost . This scary spirit was believed to a harbinger of terrible times for the monastery's lamas.</p>
<p>Among the monastery's treasures was apparently a map to the legendary Valley of Wings in the Wu Pi Te Shar mountains.</p>
<p>According to rumor, a magic pool located somewhere below the altars had the power to extend the lifespan of those who bathed in it. This was said to be why Do'dzin's abbots lived for over 130 years, even as old as 176.</p>
