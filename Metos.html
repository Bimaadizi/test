<p>Metos was a fortress in the Methwood built by the Imaskari in −3234 DR . It was made famous by Hilather and Madryoch , who had their showdown in it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Metos had, when created, sufficient extra-dimensional space to hold five-thousand soldiers and still be self-sufficient. It was very well protected against infiltration, as it required a portal key to access. The fortress was where Madryoch was confronted by a young Hilather, before being banished to the Demiplane of Imprisonment .</p>
<p>However, the strength of the complex was never tested. Lord Yuvaraj recalled the forces from the complex to quash the rebellion of the Mulan in −2489 to −2488 DR , leaving the fortress virtually unmanned, confident no one would know how to access its portals .</p>
<h2>Legends</h2>
<p>It was said that Turami refugees displaced by the Mulan slaves dwelled in Metos for centuries before migrating westwards to Chessenta , Unther , and Turmish .</p>
