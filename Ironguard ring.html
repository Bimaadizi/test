<p>An ironguard ring was an enchanted ring that allowed metal to pass harmlessly through the wearer.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Rings sold in Ravens Bluff around 1367Â DR were plain brass rings, some of which had a diamond marking on the inside to signal they could be activated up to twice.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Some rings only lasted for one activation or two, providing the effects of an ironguard spell for ten minutes. Unlike the spell, those expelled metal from the user's body as the effect ended, rather than exposing them to injury.</p>
<p>Other rings were active continuously, making metal pass harmlessly through the user, as per the effects of a lesser ironguard .</p>
