<p>The Central Port of Skullport was a ward in Skullport and home to the city's most impoverished and marginalized inhabitants.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The numerous buildings of the Central Port were precariously situated on deteriorating ledges, and the network of narrow, slick catwalks presented a constant hazard to those unsteady on their feet. The ambient moisture in the district was particularly pronounced. Due to persistent seepage from the cavern ceiling above, individuals traversing the district were frequently subjected to a steady fall of foul-smelling water.</p>
