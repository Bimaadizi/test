<p>Rods were scepter-like objects that could be used by spellcasters to focus their spells. They were particularly favored by warlocks . Some magical rods had unique magical powers.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Typical rods were usually 2–3 ft (61–91 cm) long cylinders made of metal, wood, or bone.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The primary use of rods was to channel the spellcasting powers of arcane spellcasters such as artificers , bards , sorcerers , warlocks or wizards , aiding them when casting their spells. By doing so, someone using a rod as a spellcasting focus could eschew most of the more ordinary material components required for a spell.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Spellplague changed the nature of rods in the Realms. Infused with dark, eldritch energy rods often possessed the touch of some creature with which a warlock had formed a pact. As such, many rods were particularly potent in the hands of specific warlocks, who had forged the appropriate pacts with outsiders .</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Rods were popular in Mulhorand . Dreadmasters of Bane also had a special affinity for rods, and often created them.</p>
<p>It was known that some spellcasters carried rods in sheaths on their hips.</p>
