<p>Green sleeping dust was a drug that caused a creature to fall asleep.</p>
<p>It was made from parts of the bija tree , which was found in the Quang Muku Forest in Koryo , Kara-Tur . It was incredibly potent—a person who inhaled the dust could not resist falling asleep.</p>
<p>Around 1357 DR , its main users were ninja in service to the Soretyo family of Foo Nakar , a city within the Quang Muku. Some merchants with illicit dealings could purchase it as well, though it was very expensive.</p>
<p>Green sleeping dust may have been used by the "nameless ones" — ninja — who kidnapped Meo Li around 1350 DR . She recalled a "magic powder", blown like a "puff of smoke" in her face, and knew nothing more. [ speculation ]</p>
