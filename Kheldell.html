<p>Kheldell was a thorp on the northern brim of the Westwood in the foothills of the Sword Coast Spires during the mid-14 th century DR . The only way into the small village of log homes was by taking the trail to Red Larch .</p>
<p>The economy of the village centered around logging and the horse -powered sawmill. As of 1365 DR , the leader of the loggers was a wizard named Ghelkyn Stormwind who levitated the cut timber to waiting horse teams who would then transport them to Red Larch for sale. Loggers only cut the trees that local druids , the Dusk Circle allowed them to fell, and in turn, planted more trees than they took.</p>
<p>As of 1365 DR decisions about the town were made by consensus but the most influential people were Ghelkyn and Shala Thaeral , the Voice of the Circle .</p>
<p>The small village was also home to Tchandrae Euinwood , a girl with mysterious powers of magical identification.</p>
