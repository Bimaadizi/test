<p>Artur Grossman was the leader of the Rogues of Tilverton in the 1350sâ€“1360s DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Artur was a grossly overweight man who was typically bedecked in flashy jewellery.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Grossman was a pleasant and reasonable man, and wished to operate his thieves' guild in a quiet and inconspicuous manner. He very much enjoyed the company of beautiful women who served him, and while otherwise charming he was quite sexist towards the women in his guild. He rather enjoyed bad poetry, and had an interest in historical texts.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Artur wore regal, tattered robes that were actually robes of defense . He had a comprehensive library of bad poetry and history books that he was very fond of.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Grossman had two beloved pets, a pair of dire wolves he raised from pups named Fluffy and Bojangles .</p>
<p>His daughter Lharae Grossman worked loyally for him by charming the clergy of Gond and the city's Purple Dragons garrison, gathering confidential information that she passed on to the Rogues.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Artur's father, the former Guildmaster, was slain by members of the Fire Knives who sought shelter in Tilverton after being driven from Cormyr in 1341 DR . He fought a quiet war against the Fire Knives afterwards, wishing to keep them from destabilizing Cormyr or killing King Azoun Obarskyr IV , as he very much appreciated the status quo.</p>
<p>In 1367 DR he had disappeared, presumed dead, and his daughter Lharae took over the Rogues.</p>
