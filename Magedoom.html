<p>Magedooms were horrors created by Zhentarim wizards to eradicate non-Zhentarim wizards.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The distinct smell of ozone permeated the air around a magedoom. The scent was said to resemble a fresh lightning strike combined with potent citrus fruit. A magedoom appeared to be a conical mound of beige muck shining with moisture. The mound was crowned with a desiccated eyeless human head. A pair of stout appendages hung where "arms" might be expected to be found. These appendages terminated with large, bloodshot eyes.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Magedooms were always found alone. In fact, it was rumored that if two magedooms came within 10 ft (3 m) of each other, an explosion would result creating a dead-magic zone with a 40 ft (12 m) radius that lasted for a month.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>A magedoom would always attack a spellcaster first if confronted with multiple enemies. Their heavy appendages caused significant harm when striking a target.</p>
<p>When a wizard cast a spell within 180 ft (55 m) of a magedoom it was able to target the source of the spell and track them. When the target wizard was within striking distance the magedoom would lash out with a slimy tentacle and touch the wizard on the forehead. This attack was similar to an energy drain but it only drained the wizard's ability to cast powerful spells. The spells beyond the wizard's ability fled their mind, requiring them to relearn the spell. This effect faded over a few hours.</p>
<p>Since magedooms were blind, and tracked their target by sensing magic, any spells or attacks against sight had no effect upon them.</p>
<p>These creatures radiated an anti-magic shell in a 3 ft (0.91 m) radius around them. This anti-magic shell effectively negated any magical enchantment for equipment within this area.</p>
<p>If slain during combat a magedoom would explode in a destructive wild surge that affected anything within 15 ft (4.6 m). This wild surge lasted for five minutes after the magedoom's death.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>A magedoom's sole purpose for existing was the destruction of non-Zhentish spellcasters. Mystra , Azuth and their priesthoods loathed these vile creations. The destruction of a magedoom was often a required task given by a high priest in the form of a geas for followers of Mystra or Azuth who acted against their gods and wished to return to their favor. Azuth was rumored to grant experienced followers a unique spell designed to destroy magedooms.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A living wizard was used to create a magedoom. The wizard's body and spirit were transformed using a forbidden spell. The resulting magedoom was partially controlled by the archmage who created it, providing the magedoom with a task and allowing the magedoom a wide variety of freedom to complete the task however it wished.</p>
