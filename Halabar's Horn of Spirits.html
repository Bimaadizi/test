<p>Halabar's Horn of Spirits was a particularly filthy bar, found on Lanthalar street in the city of Sundabar , during the mid-14 th century DR . Just about everything within the establishment, especially the furniture, had been broken.</p>
<p>The patrons of Halabar's Horn were a particularly deplorable lot. They would often pour out of the front doors, and fight and drink in the city streets.</p>
