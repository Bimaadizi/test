<p>Elué Shundar , also known as the Lady of the Gate , was a female half-elf sorcerer and adventuress who shared her body with Mystra . The goddess ' possession enabled Elué to give birth to the Seven Sisters , all of Mystra's Chosen and fathered by the Elué's husband, Dornal Silverhand .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Elué was a sorceress of enough talent to have a successful adventuring career, supplemented by her sundry studies. When she had the chance, however, she preferred to test and experiment with her own limits by exploring ruins across the dangerous northwest Faerûn . She was also strong enough to host Mystra's essence for nearly a decade while she bore all seven of the legendary Sisters, though it ultimately decayed her until she was effectively a lich , one that depended on the Lady of Mysteries' power to survive.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Adventuring Years</h3>
<p>Elué's family hailed from Silverymoon , but, according to Elminster (himself relying on Mystra for information), she spent most of her days adventuring down the ports of the Sword Coast . Often, she worked as a hireling or cargo escort for merchants . So fruitful were her endeavors that, at some point in the early 8 th century DR , Elué was able to purchase for herself an estate in the countryside where she grew and sold herbs , mushrooms , and watercress with the help of farmers staying on her land.</p>
<p>Though she had previously relied on books and scrolls to hone her magical abilities, Elué's new homestead allowed her the chance to experiment with her Art, a passion that eventually pushed her to resume her adventuring career. Now, however, she ventured into the Savage Frontier , where she explored fallen cities of ancient Netheril , studied portals , and even made friends with a few silver dragons .</p>
<p>It was during the Year of the Scorched Sea, 758 DR , while on an expedition into the ruins of an old wizard 's tower, that she met the ranger known as Dornal Silverhand. Though he first assumed her to be a sorceress of evil disposition, and subsequently engaged her in combat, the man could not help but fall in love with her, pursuing Elué for the next two years.</p>
<h3>Vessel of Mystra</h3>
<p>It was not until the Year of Drifting Stars, 760 DR that "Elué" fervidly returned Dornal's feelings; in reality, it was Mystra, possessing the previously reluctant Elué, who seduced the half-elf's admirer. When Mystra revealed her intentions to her mortal vessel, Elué was glad to continue sharing her faculties with the Mistress of Magic.</p>
<p>Elué met her future husband's dying mother when they settled into Silverhand Tower . The old woman seemed to recognize her as an old friend she had made in her dreams, though Elminster believed these dreams to have been brought forth by Mystra's hand. Regardless, it was that same year that Elué and Dornal finally married.</p>
<p>For the next seven years, beginning in the Year of Laughter, 761 DR , Elué became pregnant. She gave birth to six beautiful, silver-haired girls, but by the time she was pregnant with their seventh child in the Year of the Awakening Wyrm, 767 DR , Elué was no longer the same. The process had aged and withered her terribly, making her something similar to a lich , worrying Dornal. In his desperation to understand what was taking her, and his chances of having a son, from him, he had Elué inspected by a priest of Tyche . The Neveren man, Unsible , could not fully grasp the truth of what was possessing Elué, only that it was sentient and powerful, a revelation that further troubled her husband. At some point afterwards, Elué walked through a moonlit glade with Dornal—where he severed her head from her shoulders, ending her suffering. There her corpse remained, without its head, before it was found and her grim fate was learned.</p>
