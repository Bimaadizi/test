<p>The Path of the Zealot was a primal path for those warriors that were said to have distinguished souls destined to battle for all eternity. Known individually as zealots , these barbarians fought with such determined faith that they channeled divine power unto themselves when they entered into a barbarous rage .</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Barbarians that walked the path of the zealot were often found among the faithful of Bane , Gruumsh , Tempus , and Tyr .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>After beginning down the path of the zealot, these barbarians could channel divine power―in the form of necrotic or holy energy ―in the first blow they landed in battle while enraged.</p>
<p>While enraged, more battle-hardened zealots could shrug off effects that would incapacitate lesser warriors. They learned how to inspire zeal in others, bolstering their allies' combat prowess for a short while.</p>
<p>The most veteran zealots could shrug off mortal wounds and keep fighting in a rage of fury. Their injuries would only catch up to them once their rage ended, and it was only then that their life could be claimed by the gods.</p>
