<p>Cazador Szarr was an elf vampire lord who lived in Baldur's Gate .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Cazador led a coven of other vampires and was incredibly power-hungry. He treated his slaves very poorly, and even carved writing into their backs, which he described to them as poems.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Daystars, 1268 DR , Cazador rescued a high elf , Astarion , from a group of Gurs . However, Szarr later made him a vampire spawn slave and forced him to carry out tasks unwillingly.</p>
<p>Cazador became the vampire lord of Baldur's Gate in the Year of the Crumbling Keep, 1276 DR , when he killed his master, Vellioth "the Martinet", in the Rite of Perfect Slaughter .</p>
<p>Sometime in between the 13 th and 14 th century DR , Cazador started carving infernal contracts onto the backs of his spawn, which were part of an agreement with the archdevil Mephistopheles . The devil would grant him the knowledge about an ancient ritual named the Rite of Profane Ascension , or the Black Mass , which would allow Szarr to become a higher form of vampiric being, called the Vampire Ascendant . In this form, the strength of his vampiric abilities would increase tremendously, and he would no longer be affected by the curses usually afflicting his kind, such as being vulnerable to sunlight.</p>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Astarion was captured by a nautiloid and injected with an illithid tadpole . Astarion believed Cazador sent a Gur monster-hunter called Gandrel to recapture him. In the meantime, he revealed to his spawn the existence of the Rite of Profane Ascension, falsely claiming that he would share its boon with them all.</p>
