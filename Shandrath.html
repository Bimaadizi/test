<p>Shandrath , usually referred to as the Old Shandrath , was the most powerful wizard of the kingdom of Athalantar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In his youth, Shandrath killed or tamed many dragons , earning his moniker, "Wyrmhumbler".</p>
<p>He arrived in Athalantar in old age and usually stayed alone in his Wyrm Tower . When the Stag King Uthgrael Aumar died in 216 DR , Shandrath kept an eye on his son Elthryn Aumar , considered to be the best choice for the kingdom. At the same time, he tried to ruin the plots of the other princes, especially Belaur Aumar and his magelords .</p>
<p>Finally, in 222 DR , a large group of magelords attacked the Wyrm Tower and in a massed spell-attack Shandrath died, but took many magelords with him.</p>
