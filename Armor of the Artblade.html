<p>The armor of the Artblade , also known as the Artblade's reflection , was a kind of clothing and armor found in Myth Drannor during the late 14 th century DR , magically derived from the legendary Artblade .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These reflections took the form of various pieces of elven armor and clothing with a consistent black and red appearance, including light , medium , and heavy armor , cloaks , robes , helmets , whole outfits, and docent -like trinkets.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These items were exceptionally protective and aided the wearer's spellcasting while protecting them from the same. The cloaks further aided fiery and electric spells, while helms empowered cold and acidic spells.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These disparate pieces of gear were created when the echo of the Artblade defiantly broke from the Artblade proper, creating an array of linked magical items from pure magic. These remained in Myth Drannor, waiting to be found by those like Tannivh Dahast 's Cormanthor Elves and the Red Wizards of Droic Orgul . The Red Wizards further strengthened these items, but their connection to the Artblade let them withstand the corruptive evil of their rituals.</p>
