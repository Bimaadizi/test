<p>Hertvor Dremble was a hireling guard who worked for Baldur's Mouth in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hertvor was a human man with a tan skin tone, hazel eyes, and long, wavy brown hair. Like his fellow guards, Hertvor wore chainmail armor and wielded a simple spear .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Hertvor Dremble was employed by Baldur's Mouth and its editor-in-chief, Ettvard Needle . He was tasked with guarding the broadsheet's entryway, just past the main doors into the building. Hertvor found it odd the Gazette employed so many guards and was protected by the steel watchers . He also found the old saying "the pen really was mightier than the sword" quite questionable.</p>
