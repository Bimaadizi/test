<p>Haku was the god of freedom of Zakhara . He was one of the eight Great Gods of the Land of Fate and preached the value of personal independence and self-reliance.</p>
<p>Haku's symbol was a stylized gust of wind.</p>
<p>In tales he was described as a proud nomad garbed in flowing desert clothing, wearing a gleaming scimitar. Like other Zakharan gods he was above such concerns as alignment, as a noble desert rider may value independence as highly as a dark-hearted assassin .</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Free Haku had many worshipers among Al-Badia , the desert nomads of Zakhara. In the Cities of the Pantheon , however, his faith was persecuted. He was also the deity most worshiped by the djinn .</p>
