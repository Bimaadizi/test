<p>Buyan was a fishing village in the hinterland of Laothan in Malatra , lying somewhere on the coast of the Eastern Sea near the Parabin Shoals.</p>
<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>In the midâ€“14 th century DR , the Seng fishermen here did good business gathering shellfish such as oysters from the shallows, as well as their pearls . In particular, the oyster beds near the Parabin Shoals were known to produce the highest-quality pearls in Malatra. These pearls were traded through Kwang Tre . Even the prejudiced old Kuong nun Ama conceded that the people of Buyan were "adequate" pearl-divers, "for Seng".</p>
