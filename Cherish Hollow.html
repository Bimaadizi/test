<h2>History</h2>
<p>Daughter of Thibault Hollow , Cherish penned her book sometime before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , in which she defended a lady's need for the art of necromancy despite the questions and disdain of others. In her book, Cherish used the example of her undead attendant to prove her point. The zombie who once was Mister Nascent Owens retained none of his living thoughts or memories. The necromancer believed that Nascent found pleasure in serving her tea , giving backrubs, and eating the mistress's enemies. Cherish stated that giving purpose and direction to the discarded husk was the best economical and metaphysical approach to the taboo of death in her contemporary society. Furthermore, Cherish stated that, as such, the art of necromancy was helpful for those who were lonely.</p>
