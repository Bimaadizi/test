<p>Presio's dagger was an enchanted Talonite weapon wielded by Presio , the necromancer - cleric of Talona in 1281 DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Presio's dagger was enchanted to keep a keen edge, giving it an equivalent of a +2 enchantment. It was also magically infused with poison that continued damaging its targets following a successful strike, gradually sapping the target's strength.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Presio's dagger was a ceremonial weapon of the Talonite faith, given to Presio by her church sometime before the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , after attaining the rank of the Most Debilitating Holiness. The dagger's ceremonial nature was obvious, considering Presio's denomination did not allow her to use bladed weapons.</p>
<p>In 1281 DR, Presio's dagger was in its mistress' possession during her time in the Dragon's Eye , Spine of the World , working for Yxunomei , to destroy Kuldahar and conquer Icewind Dale . After Presio's death, the dagger was picked up by the heroes of Icewind Dale and eventually, in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , ended up in Marcos Flass 's collection of magic items during his work in Termalaine of the Ten-Towns .</p>
