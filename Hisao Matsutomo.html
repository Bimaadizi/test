<p>Hisao Matsutomo was a head of the Matsutomo clan and a daimyo of Aru Province in Wa in the early 1700s on the Wa Calendar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hisao succeeded his father, Masakito Matsutomo , on his death in Wa Year 1725 (1307 DR) . Hisao lacked his father's wisdom and corruption flourished in Aru Province. Many of his advisors established their own "business interests", most egregiously charging pilgrims a "visitation fee" to worship at the Shining Temple of Bishamon . When the shogun heard of his violation of tradition, Hisao and the Matsutomos were removed from power in Wa Year 1730 (1312 DR) , and the daimyate was passed to the Yayazato clan.</p>
