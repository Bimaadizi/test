<p>The Long Road was a route in northeast Faerûn that connected the Kingdom of Damara to the far north of Rashemen .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The road provided a trade route between the Cold Lands and the Unapproachable East , connecting the merchants of Damara, Rashemen, and Narfell . It was not an easy trip as the road was little more than a wide trail, and parts were impassable during the winter.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>While some maps put the route’s western origin in Damara at Helgabal , the Long Road itself truly began along the Merchant's Run just south of the city of Trailsend in the Barony of Polten . From there, it travelled northeast along the edge of the Dunwood , passing through the town of Tellerth before heading north through the Giantspire Mountains at Giant Gap to arrive in Narfell. The Gap was less a pass and more an area of low hills between the mountains, and was known to become clogged with snow in the winter months.</p>
<p>In Narfell, the route passed the Nar meeting grounds at Nar-sek Qu'istrade before proceeding east to its first major stopover at the village of Jiyyd , located at the intersection with the trail north to Peltarch . The Long Road then proceeded through Ormpur to the village of N'Jast at the crossroads with the Cold Road . It then continued east, traversing the rest of Narfell north of the Firward Mountains and Erech Forest before crossing the River Erech at Mistbridge to arrive in the North Country of Rashemen. From there, it cut through the northern fringes of the Endless Wastes , passing near the Fortress of the Half-Demon and crossing the Iceborn River , before finally ending in Nathoud at the base of the Icerim Mountains .</p>
