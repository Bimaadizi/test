<p>Fael , also known as Darcin Cole , was a cleric -merchant and, secretly, an agent of the Twisted Rune , from the village of Imnesvale in the Umar Hills of Amn in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Fael was a human man with light skin and light chestnut hair. He wore a set of enchanted +1 leather armor and wielded a war hammer .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Fael traded in his humble stock of common potions and a small collection of books , including tomes about Halruaa , Zhentarim , waterdeep , and the Drow . In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the village of Imnesvale faced a slew of disappearances, and locals did not hesitate to blame the legendary Umar Witch . Fael was worried by the disappearances but, even more so, was alerted by the disappearance of the local ranger protector Merella , who disappeared after venturing into the hills in search of the first victim of disappearances. However, in reality, he cared naught for local peasants and was working discreetly with Rejiek Hidesman , a serial killer, to create a heinous enchanted item on behalf of the Twisted Rune â€“ a set of armor called the Human Flesh . It was, indeed, made out of human flesh.</p>
