<p>Srandro Chree was a thug-for-hire operating in the city of Delzimmer in southeast Faerûn circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . He had no qualms against killing people, as long as the price was right.</p>
<p>One of his victims was the shopkeeper that wouldn't stay dead, Antholo Kraul . After being killed gruesomely and miraculously returned to life, twice, one of Antholo's cousins hired Chree to assassinate him, hopefully permanently. Srandro Chree did his job late one night, but by the next evening, Kraul was seen drinking in the Reaching Hand tavern with friends as if nothing unusual had happened. The nagra (local police) never proved the cousin hired Chree, but caught her in the act of killing Kraul herself by tipping a heavy flower urn off a balcony onto his head (from which he again returned from the dead).</p>
