<p>The Statue of Alias the Sellsword was a magically protected monument erected in the Market Triangle of Westgate in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Statue of Alias the Sellsword stood on the eastern side of the Market Triangle, several doors north from Westblade Guild Headquarters and Shalush Myrkeer's Shop . A small sidewalk plaza surrounded the monument, and richly decorated buildings rose above it.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The monument was a large statue depicting a young and attractive woman in a heroic battle stance, adorned in armor and wielding a sword. The woman depicted was the hero of Westgate who hailed from the nation of Cormyr â€”the unaging and sweet-voiced Alias the Sellsword, also known as Alias of the Azure Bonds, or Alias of the Magic Arm (according to the Chronicles of Alias of the Magic Arm by Olive Ruskettle ). The monument appeared clean and unmolested by elements.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>With aid from Mintassan the Magnificent, friend and ally of Alias's, the monument was enchanted to be unaffected by the elements and resist any attempts to vandalize it. The statue was even protected from being spit upon, and its magics redirected the wet projectiles away from Alias. If any attempts to vandalize the statue took place, a magical message appeared at its base saying: "This statue is magically protected from Night Masks and other destructive forces by Mintassan the Magnificent."</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The statue was erected to celebrate Alias and her heroics in Westgate in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR . Her fame was fueled by her faithful stand against the Night Masks guild. The statue itself was placed in the Market Triangle several years before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR .</p>
