<p>House Mizzrym was the fifth drow house of Menzoberranzan in 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Headquarters</h2>

<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Mages of House Mizzrym were well known for their skill at illusions .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Founded relatively recently compared to other drow noble houses in −643 DR , House Mizzrym's rise to power over the centuries was founded on trade, including with non-drow races. By 1357 DR , the House had cultivated clandestine trade deals with deep gnomes and garnered a great deal of wealth. This allowed it to rise to the position of seventh house of Menzoberranzan.</p>
<p>In 1359 DR , House Mizzrym moved up to sixth house when House Oblodra was destroyed during the Time of Troubles by House Baenre .</p>
<p>During the Silence of Lolth ( 1372 DR – 1373 DR ), House Mizzrym climbed the ranks once again to fifth house thanks to the treachery and fall of House Agrach Dyrr .</p>
<p>In 1484 DR , House Mizzrym ascended to the fourth house after the departure of House Xorlarrin for Q'Xorlarrin , replacing House Faen Tlabbar .</p>
