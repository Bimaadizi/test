<p>The Temple of Odin in the city of Bral was perhaps the only shrine to the god Odin in Realmspace .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Temple of Odin was actually a small shrine, but it was one of the oldest on the Rock of Bral and was well-respected.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple was located in the Low City on the starboard side of Grand Street , near the port-side entrance to the Lesser Market .</p>
<h2>Congregation</h2>
<p>It was debatable whether or not the priest of Odin could even communicate with his god, since, of the Norse pantheon , only Tyr —believed by some to be Odin's son —had a presence in Realmspace. However, by the end of the 14 th century, the congregation of worshipers at the shrine numbered about 100. If the congregation continued to grow, it was possible that Odin would obtain demigod status in Realmspace.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The shrine was founded in the early 14 th century DR by vikings from another world who were transported to Realmspace by an enigmatic space storm.</p>
