<h2>History</h2>
<p>Viente and his partner Gio spent many years traveling across Halruaa, entertaining locals with acts of music and "magic." for several years before the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Troupe Gioviente took in a young mage on the run, Tzigone , who later in life would be known as the hero of the Battle of Akhlaur's Swamp . The loving duo was the closest thing to a family the young woman had. By the spring of 1370 DR, Tzigone parted ways with the Troupe. That spring, Viente, along with the traveling company, performed in the city of Khaerbaal and were ready to head to Sulazir for a while. They were delayed by the youngest addition to the Troupe - young troublemaker Carmelo , whose antics always attracted the attention of Halruaan Inquisitors . Carmelo was thrown into Khaerbaal's hold, delaying the group's departure.</p>
