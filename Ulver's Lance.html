<h2>Geography</h2>

<h2>Trade</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The namesake of Ulver's Lance was a hero named Ulver who kept the Halondar safe from bugbears , orcs , goblins , and other monsters who raided merchant caravans in the nation's early years.</p>
<p>In the late-14 th century DR , inhabitants of Ulver's Lance cared little of the old hero. Instead, they cared about an unknown thief plaguing the town. That individual visited sleeping villages and took just a few coins each time. The locals thought the thief had some magical means of making folk fall asleep or even ways of moving through solid walls. Circa 1360 DR , a local woodsman claimed to have fallen into a cellar of a burned down house at Lance's edge. He discovered numerous boxes, chests, and urns filled with the town's stolen coins. The woodcutter bragged about the find at a tavern and spent looted coin generously. The next morning, his decapitated corpse was discovered in a secluded alley. Townsfolk tried to claim the said treasure but discovered the burnt-out house's cellars empty. The treasure's fate was unknown; however, coin thefts continued.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>Shrines to Silvanus , the Forest Father, and to Tyr , the Even-Handed, could be found in the town.</p>
