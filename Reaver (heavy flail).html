<p>Reavers were a variety of enchanted heavy flails created on the Sword Coast North in the late 14 th century DR , and used as a valuable smuggling good on the Elemental Plane of Fire .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>There existed three variants of the Reavers weapon, each possessed a +1 , +2 , and +8 enchantments what made the flail's bludgeons deadlier and guided the wielder's hand towards the target. All three versions were ensorcelled to deal additional magical cold damage upon strikes.</p>
<p>An ironwood mace could be created from an enchanted heavy flail and a portion of dragon blood .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The oldest and strongest variety of the Reaver flails were created to be smuggled to the Elemental Plane of Fire by planeswalking travelers and merchants tho sought to make extra coin. Theses weapons were deadly to the creatures of fire and were perfect tools for the Plane of Fire's assassins.</p>
<p>More common versions of Reavers with a simpler +1 enchantment were forged by Master Blacksmith Marrok of Shining Knight Arms and Armor shop of Neverwinter to help the heroes who sought the cure from the dreaded Wailing Death of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Later the same year, more powerful versions were created by Master Blacksmith Barun of Beorunna's Well to help the forces of Neverwinter stand against Lady Aribeth the Betrayer , who led a marching army of Luskan in the deadly but short-lived Neverwinter-Luskan war.</p>
