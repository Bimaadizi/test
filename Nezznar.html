<p>Nezznar , also known as the Black Spider , was a drow who was in search of the Forge of Spells in Wave Echo Cave .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nezznar wore a long purple cloak with a red interior, and wielded a black quarterstaff known as a spider staff .</p>
<p>He was quite intelligent and curious, and had knowledge of the arcane arts. The drow did not break into a combat at any given opportunity, but preferred to first study and understand the motives of potential foes. He would, though, betray his enemies after they had exhausted their usefulness. Nezznar was a skilled wizard, and focused on different schools of magic, from evocation to illusion to abjuration .</p>
<p>The ambitious drow had many spies reaching all the way to Neverwinter , as well as several giant spiders , which acted as guards.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Nezznar owned a spider staff , which was a quarterstaff that could poison foes. He also carried a potion of healing , a key to a cell, several pieces of coin, nine gemstones , and a slab of electrum crafted in the shape of a mug of dwarven ale . The drow also claimed the dwarven temple to Dumathoin as his personal quarters during the exploration of Wave Echo Cave.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1491 DR , the drow promised a share to Iarno Albrek of the Lords' Alliance in exchange for his loyalty and aid. Nezznar was the true leader of the Redbrands , controlling them (as well as the Cragmaw tribe of goblinoids ) in the hopes of finding Wave Echo Cave and unlocking its secrets (while also keeping it a secret for himself).</p>
<p>After finding the mine, Nezznar came across two of the Rockseeker brothers, Nundro and Tharden . He slew Tharden, but kept Nundro as a hostage, as he thought the dwarf knew more than the he was letting on. From then on, he focused on getting to the legendary forge, but was set back by hordes of undead, and rooms full of poisonous fungi .</p>
