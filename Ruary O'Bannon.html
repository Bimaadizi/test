<p>Ruary O'Bannon was the Ffolk captain of the House Kendrick garrison on the island of Moray within the Moonshae Isles during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Captain Ruary was no-nonsense. He hated the lycanthropes of the Black Blood tribe , and considered the many other dangerous enemies he faced on Moray—such as orcs and ettins —to be mere nuisances by comparison. He feared that the rest of the Moonshae Isles did not care about his and his troops' efforts on Moray, and he was thankful for the assistance of adventurers (although he did not often say so aloud).</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He was well-liked by the people who still dwelt on the dangerous island, and made himself easy to find within the town of Moray .</p>
<p>He was responsible for coordinating the rotation of troops into his garrison, which sometimes came from local sea captains and nobles. He had a relationship with the Mac Lyrr family of Warlsbry on Alaron , who pledged their support of his garrison. On occasion, he also secured support from Amnian interests, although the locals tended not to trust such soldiers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A native of Moray, Captain Ruary was born in the late 1440s DR. By the time he was in his early 30s in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , he was a veteran soldier and was serving as captain of the Moray garrison. During this time, Daffyd Mac Lyrr arrived at Caer Moray with the intention of liberating the island from the Black Blood tribe. Far from welcome news, Captain O'Bannon thought his plan was terrible, and that the small army he had mustered would be more useful as defenders of Caer Moray.</p>
