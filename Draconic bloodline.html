<p>Draconic bloodline sorcerers were those practitioners of the arcane arts who had some biological connection with dragons , either through their own relations or those of their forebears.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Most of these sorcerers had some distant relative that forged a bargain with a dragon, or had a trace of draconic lineage. Yet others were considered among the minions that served the mighty and magical beasts.</p>
<p>Draconic bloodline sorcerers often learned to speak, read, and write the language of dragons.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Depending on the variety of dragon to which they were linked, whether chromatic , metallic , or otherwise, these sorcerers possessed a certain fortitude that was uncommon among their fellow practitioners. They held an affinity for the specific element that was associated with that type of dragon, most often fire , cold , lightning , poison , or acid . They could readily protect themselves from that chosen element, and the spells they cast utilizing it were exceptionally potent.</p>
<p>As they grew in power, draconic bloodline sorcerers began to more resemble dragonkind. They gained the ability to grow draconic wings from their back and take upon themselves the terrifying aura of a dragon that instilled fear in lesser beings.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , draconic bloodline sorcerers were most prominent in the lands of Chessenta and Murgh√¥m , each of which had been ruled by dragons and kin for nearly a century or longer.</p>
