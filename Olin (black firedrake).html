<p>Olin was a black firedrake who served the Ransar of Innarlith as a bodyguard in the mid–14 th century DR.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Marek Rymüt was a Thayan Red Wizard living in Innarlith in the mid–14 th century DR acting as a secret agent on behalf of Thay while posing as a self-employed seller of magical items and services. He began a project of creating black firedrakes in 1361 DR using the black dragon great wyrm Insithryllax and female fire drakes to create the mutant creatures.</p>
<p>Olin was one of the creatures that was created and he was kept within a pocket dimension under Marek's control that he called the Land of One Hundred and Thirteen along with other black firedrakes. On Eleint 8 in 1364 DR , Marek polymorphed Olin into a human form as the first of many black firedrakes that he planned to polymorph in order to serve as an army for the person that Marek planned to install as the new Ransar of Innarlith. Marek made Olin the captain of the other black firedrakes.</p>
<p>On Highharvestide , 1365 DR , Senator Salatis launched a coup in Innarlith to usurp Ransar Osorkon with help from Marek's black firedrakes. Captain Olin led his black firedrakes to besiege the Palace of Many Spires and fought a battle with Osorkon and his bodyguards in the Ransar's office. Olin and another black firedrake succeeded in killing Osorkon in the melee in their polymorphed human forms.</p>
<p>Salatis was then appointed as the new Ransar of Innarlith by the Senate of Innarlith and Olin served as his chief bodyguard. Salatis constructed a secret shrine to Shar in the Palace of Many Spires and then ordered the workmen who built the shrine to be killed after they had completed their work to preserve the secret. Olin carried out the Ransar's request by murdering them in the shrine with his axe at the conclusion of their labor.</p>
<p>Later, Senator Pristoleph raised an army and invaded Innarlith in an attempt to install himself as the new Ransar of Innarlith. Olin and the other black firedrakes switched sides when Pristoleph had taken much of the city and laid siege to the palace. They murdered Salatis in his office and handed his body over to Pristoleph. Thereafter they served the new ransar.</p>
<p>Olin and the other black firedrakes later successfully fought off an assassination attempt on Pristoleph by a maurezhi that had been sent by Marek Rymüt.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In his polymorphed human form, Olin had brown skin and deep black eyes.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He possessed an ability to transform between his black firedrake and human forms, given to him by Marek Rymüt . In either form, he possessed a breath weapon composed of both acid and flame. He was proficient with a long axe in his polymorphed human form and was able to understand Common .</p>
