<p>Cedric Ravajar was a human man, once a leader of the Red Brigade mercenaries and later a leader of the Vipers bandits .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Cedric Ravajar was a mercenary for much of his adult life. He was also best friends with Soren Whitespear for many years, before either of them joined the Red Brigade as mercenaries.</p>
<p>After four years of service, Cedric rose to lead the Red Brigade as its Captain , due to combat ability and charisma. Soren served as his second-in-command. In the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , he accepted Calispar Delgorth into his force and included the priest in all of the company's decisions. The two men became firm allies, perhaps even friends.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , while on a routine scouting expedition for a minor noble , two Brigade scouts reported a dead magic zone in the Brynwood forest. Cedric kept the find secret, telling only Calispar, and the two scouts disappeared shortly afterwards. During the mission, Cedric met Dura Gerathu , a ranger of Brynwood.</p>
<p>Later that year, Cedric announced his retirement and disbanded the Red Brigade. In fact, he wished to go into business for himself. A trusted few, including Soren and Calispar, departed with Cedric and returned to the dead-magic zone, where they reformed into the Vipers , a bandit group. They built their base, the Vipers' Nest , within the dead-magic zone, and began raiding merchant caravans going through the Glorming Pass , all under Cedric's leadership.</p>
<p>On the 29th Eleasis , the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Cedric spotted and recognized Dura as he studied the Vipers' Nest. To prevent the ranger from revealing its location, he sent Calispar and his bandits to eliminate him.</p>
