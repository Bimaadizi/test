<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of the Grinning Halfling, 1481 DR , Myla lived in the small monastic cell of the Dragon's Rest cloister cut into the cliff face. Her cell was cluttered with junk and tools. Just like all the other kobolds, she worked at night because of their sunlight sensitivity.</p>
<p>Once Myla, Mek and Minn were attacked by " hungry, icky, blood-sucking bat things " and her wings were severely maimed. The brothers left her for dead. Later, the elder Runara aided her recovery.</p>
