<p>The Hoe was a cheap and seedy tavern in the city of Cedarsproke in the Gulthmere Forest of Vilhon Reach in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The city of Cedarsproke could be considered sleepy and serene by some, being inhabited mostly by druids who sought a peaceful life. However, the city held religious significance to the Church of Eldath and the Church of Silvanus , bringing many pilgrims to the druidic stronghold. Another locale that attracted guests was the Earthome College . It led to the spawning of half-a-dozen inns and taverns. The Hoe was among them. This cheap and seedy establishment could be found at the lakefront.</p>
