<p>Cyclopes ( sing : cyclops ; pl : cyclopes or : cyclopses ) were a race of giant-kin distinguished by having a singular, central eye.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cyclopes were one of the smallest types of giants, standing only 12 feet (3.7 meters) and weighing 1,200 pounds (540 kilograms), but they were as strong as the average stone giant . Cyclopes had earthy skin tones that blended with their surroundings. Males and females cyclopes of the Feywild were notably bald and had spiked heads instead of hair. Other cyclops had hair and more human-like appearances.</p>
<p>The most peculiar and distinguishing thing about cyclopes was the fact that they only had one large eye in the middle of their foreheads. It tended to be the same as the color of their skin. This eye was rumored to cause fear in any who looked at it. Their single eye gave them poor depth perception, however, and therefore they couldn't use missile weapons very well.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Cyclopes could throw boulders like all giant-kin, but with less accuracy than normal because of their single eye. Cyclopes that lived in the Feydark were also amazing blacksmiths and crafted powerful items for their fomorian masters.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>Cyclopes typically worshiped Grolantor , for they admired his power and might over giant-kin. But those who dwelled in fomorian societies in the Feydark often worshiped their masters, though the reasoning behind this was unknown to scholars.</p>
<p>Other sources claimed that cyclopes did not worship any gods, as they saw little benefit from prayer and disliked rituals for they seemed too complicated and foreign. However, a cyclops that gained some kind of benefits of apparently divine origin or else was threatened an unnatural force would pay homage to the supposed deity in order to retain their gift or avoid that threat, at least while it remained.</p>
<h3>Craft</h3>
<p>Cyclopes made many different and powerful magical and non- magical items . Their most proficient blacksmiths could forge rings of great magical power and swords with blades of lightning. Fomorians were known to highly value their skill in forging magical items.</p>
<h3>Activities</h3>
<p>They usually served as bodyguards, blacksmiths, soldiers, advisors, artisans, and spymasters in fomorian societies. Some eladrin believed that the roles they played in these societies were so crucial that they would be severely weakened without the cyclopes.</p>
<p>On occasion, cyclopes were known to ally themselves with drow in accordance with an ancient and mysterious agreement known as the Declaration of Eschatos .</p>
<h3>Homelands</h3>
<p>Some cyclopes lived in such places as Nacmoran .</p>
<p>When not living in cities, many cyclopes lived in caves, ruins, or forests:</p>
<p>Beyond the Prime Material plane , cyclopes could be found in the Feywild, particularly in the Dark fey enclave and Realm of Malabog . They also existed on the plane of Arborea 's layer known as Olympus and on the plane of Theros .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>There existed a wide variety of contradictory legends surrounding the origins of the cyclopes, many of them not having originated from the cyclopes themselves. They generally had little interest in how their people came to be, though many on Toril claimed they descended from the line of Annam All-Father , chief of the Giant pantheon . Most other giants on Toril believed the brutes came from one of Othea 's trysts. Other myths suggested they were descendants of Annam's son Karontor following his banishment or were descendants of the god Vaprak .</p>
<p>According to some accounts, the cyclopes originated in the Feywild, having once been ogres that aided the fomorians in their invasion of that plane and shared in their fate of being corrupted. The Olympian pantheon , who had their own questionable and rather ego-centric views on the multiverse 's creation, claimed that some of the cyclopes were originally the children of the primeval deities Gaea and Uranus , the latter of whom locked them up in the plane of Tarterus until they were eventually freed and later aided the Olympians in overthrowing the greater titans .</p>

<h2>Notable Cyclopes</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , the mage Chancil Crystalheart of Memnon summoned a cyclops to beat Conner to death but eventually relented and dispelled the summons.</p>
