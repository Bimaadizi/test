<table border='1'><tr><th>Type</th><td>Forest</td></tr><tr><th>Region</th><td>Gwynneth , the Moonshae Isles</td></tr></table><br>
<p>The Llyrath Forest blanketed the southern coast of the isle of Gwynneth in the Moonshae Isles . It was considered one of the wildest areas of the kingdom of Corwell , with few Ffolk human residents></p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The forest covered much of southwestern Gwynneth, stretching along the coast for over 150 miles (240 kilometers) from Kingsbay in the east to Kimball Moor and Goewin Wood in the west. Having such thick woods right along the sea made the coast largely inaccessible and useless to the people of Corwell.</p>
<p>A ridge of mountains known as the Daffyd Heights rose above the treetops in the middle of the forest, which separated the mundane woods of the east from the darker and more ominous woods of the west. Manann's Scar marked a further transition westward of which the dense woods were haunted by undead . Tangled and stagnant fens lay along the southern depths of the woods.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>The forest comprised aspen , oak , pine , and evergreen trees . Some types of fungi on Gwynneth could only be found in Llyrath.</p>
<p>Much wild game was present within the forest, including boars , deer , pheasants , quail , and rabbits . It was also home to dangerous wild animals, notably bears and highly aggressive giant boars , as well as monsters like trolls and scrags . In the haunted western reaches of the forest could be found depraved spirits , such as banshees .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>As of the mid–14 th century DR , the forest had few Ffolk human residents save for isolated families of lumberjacks and a few small bands of cutthroat outlaws who had fled death sentences to hide in the woods. Locals who lived along the edges of the forest generally regarded it with some apprehension. Because the forest isolated the coastline, castaways sometimes were forced to take up residence near the shore. Pirates were also known to make their hideouts in the southern edge of the woods, which in turn made it dangerous to sail the waters south of Gwynneth. Such pirates were most often Northlanders , but it was not unheard of for bands of rogue Ffolk or even sailors from the Sword Coast as far south as Calimshan to hide along the craggy coast. Their bases were rarely accessible by land, and usually consisted of crude huts built within sea caves or on narrow beaches in small coves. If they had treasure, they often hid it somewhere nearby and used a charmed or captured monster to guard it.</p>
<p>While they had no permanent settlement in the woods, firbolg raiders were known to appear in Llyrath on rare occasions, which was cause to rally the men-at-arms of Corwell.</p>
<p>Following the rise of Sarifal in the 15 th century DR, the forest came to be inhabited by gnomes with strong connections to the local fauna. It was also home to various fey , notably brownies , fairies , sprites , and will-o'-wisps .</p>
