<p>Chitu was a village located in Miyama Province in Kozakura .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Chitu, once the bustling hub for miners of the Mountain of Iron , has withered into a village in decline. The disintegration of the mining industry has led to a gradual exodus, leaving behind a landscape of hardship and neglect. Visitors were met with a scene of destitution, where the outer buildings stood abandoned, their structural integrity compromised by time and neglect. The heart of the village, though still inhabited, painted a bleak picture of poverty. Women and children, their appearances marred by the struggles of their lives, navigated a life of scarcity, while the men, once full of aspirations, now carry the weight of broken spirits, their livelihoods crushed by harsh realities.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>As of Kozakuran Year 1430 (1356 DR) , the village's jito was Fukuda Sueji . His governance was marked by self-indulgence and a disinterest in the welfare of his subjects. Unmoved by the plight of the villagers, his focus remained on personal gains and the comforts of his station.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The villagers' resignation has left them vulnerable to encroachment by undesirable elements. Bakemono and goblin rats , emerging from the mines and the surrounding forests, have begun to brazenly inhabit the fringes of Chitu.</p>
