<h3>The Victims of Tiamat</h3>
<p>Living long before the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , the small unicorn was rumored to be a pet of a diminutive barbarian among a band of young adventurers who were all trying to find a way back to their distant home. However, it was said they were all slain horribly by Tiamat , with the barbarian being swallowed by one of her heads. It was supposed that the unicorn was swallowed as well. By 1369 DR , the Adventurer Mart in Athkatla , Amn , displayed paintings of the barbarian and the ranger.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, Uni, despite being a unicorn, was known as an accomplished adventurer who traveled alongside Bobby. Fully adult, she was a strong, confident, and graceful creature who took on any challenge horn-first. Uni and Bobby were seen joining adventurers in the city of Neverwinter in the late 15 th century DR.</p>
