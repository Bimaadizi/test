<p>Davy Jones' Lock-Up , otherwise popularly known as simply the Lock-Up , was a very reputable storage facility in the city of Ravens Bluff .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This warehouse was situated seaward along the Front , in the Seaglimpse neighborhood of Ravens Bluff's Harbor District .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>This building stood two stories tall.</p>
<h3>Interior</h3>
<p>The inside of the warehouse was divided into three areas. The largest served as the storage area. It had fifty squares painted on its floor, each measuring 10 ft (3 m) by 10 ft (3 m), representing rentable space. The interior of the central space was decorated with all manner of jaws from aquatic sea life, floats, and tridents . Many old nets hung from the rafters, which could be used by the warehouse's security staff to capture intruders.</p>
<p>The other two areas were a high-security storage space and the building's office. The office area was rather simple, consisting of just two desks, two tables, eight chairs, and a drop leaf counter that crossed the room. Each desk was enspelled with magic mouth , alerting those nearby whenever an attempt was made to pick the desk's lock . The most distinguishing feature of the office was a small collection of jarred right hands taken from thiefs that had tried to rob the Lock-Up in the past, preserved to serve as a reminder of the warehouse's low tolerance for burglary. By 1362 DR there were eight of these jars . They were kept on two shelves covered by some cloth. At some point a painting was hung on the opposite wall, depicting the Ravenian Flirin in a green dress.</p>
<p>The high-security storage was almost like a separate small building within the warehouse, resembling a bank vault. It was built with three layers consisting of stone, lead , and wood. It was impenetrable by detection spells . The door to the vault had both wizard lock and glyph cast upon it, the latter inflicting a severe shock upon intruders.</p>
<p>Inside of the high-security storage were a set of numbered bins of various sizes with two locks. One of these bins was reserved for the owner, one was reserved to the local thieves' guild , and one to the city's Lord Mayor, Charles Oliver O'Kane .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The cost for renting out one of the squares on the main floor was seven silver pieces per day or two gold pieces per tenday . Payment was generally expected in advanced, although the sometimes made exceptions.</p>
<p>The Lock-Up generally didn't allow for the storage of banned goods, flammable items, or magical items. However, they didn't strictly enforce these rules, instead simply taking customers at their word that the items being stored didn't violate them.</p>
<p>The cost of renting out one of the high-security bins varied depending upon the size of the bin, ranging from 10 to 40 silver pieces per day. Each bin had two keys , one given to the renter and one kept in the possession of Davy Jones himself. Once one of the bins were opened, the renter would be directed to a small room nearby where they could have privacy.</p>
<p>Late fees were not imposed upon clients until the second week of unpaid charges, wherein the going rate was doubled. On the third week of a payment being missed the stored goods would be confiscated and auctioned off to recuperate the losses. The Lock-Up held these auctions every three months.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR , a thief tried and partially failed to burglarize the Lock-Up. They were caught, lost a hand in the process, and were locked up in prison. However, the goods they stole were never recovered. In the five years that followed, it was widely rumored that there had not been a successful robbery of the Lock-Up since that day.</p>
<p>Sometime around 1361 DR , an archaic totem was mysteriously found inside the Lock-Up one day. A group of hired adventurers went on to discover that the totem was symbol of a rising cult that had eyes on taking over the warehouse.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Among the businesses in Seaglimpse, Davy Jones' Lock-Up was among the most well known. Its auctions drew sizable crowds and it had a reputation for being secure. This reputation of secureness was helped in part by the owner's popularity among members of the City Watch and Nightwatch . As well as by the thieves' guild's active forbid members from robbing the Lock-Up, in return for having their own high-security bin. They even refused to come to the aid of any members caught attempting to loot it.</p>
<p>In the rare instances when the Lock-Up was successfully robbed, significant bounties would be placed.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Lock-Up was owned and operated by Davy Jones . He always had two workers on site during the day that doubled as guards and four guards stationed at night. One of these day-guards was a burly human named Karngain . Additionally, members of the City Watch sometimes moonlighted as guards.</p>
<p>The building was also protected at all hours by a trio of trained carnivorous apes named Mike , Mickey , and Pete . These apes hid themselves in the rafters and would utilize the nets hung up there to capture intruders, which would then cause an alarm bell to sound. They generally resisted the urge to feast upon intruders, unless they tried to force themselves free. In case the apes ever got out of hand, Davy kept around a ring of mammal control .</p>
