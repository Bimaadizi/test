<p>Iron was a non-precious metal mined and worked widely on Toril . A versatile and tough substance, it was widely used for tools, weapons, armor, construction, furniture, magic, and alchemy, and alloys such as steel .</p>
<h2>Properties</h2>
<p>Pure iron weighed 490 pounds (220 kilograms) per 1 cubic foot (28 liters), while impure forms tended to weigh a little less. Iron had a relatively high melting point ranging from 1,832 ℉ (1,000 ℃ ) to 5,432 ℉ (3,000 ℃ ) depending on the impurities present, but could still be warped or melted by the heat flash of fireball and lightning bolt spells. Prior to the Time of Troubles , iron required a significant amount of progress on a psionicist 's part before it could be synthesized through molecular rearrangement .</p>
<p>Iron was found in several notable forms:</p>
<p>Metals that resembled iron but were still distinctly different substances could also be found:</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Aurora's Emporium sold iron through its catalogue in varying forms for use as magical reagents, such as strips, chunks, powders, and cubes, as well as pyrite. Ordinary iron for forging could be bought in 1 lb bars for 5 cp , and larger 10 lb ingots for 4 sp . The Emporium also offered pre-made 1‑foot (30‑centimeter) square sheets (5 cp), 1‑foot (30‑centimeter) of wire (5 cp), and 10‑inch (25‑centimeter) by 1‑inch (2.5‑centimeter) strips (4 cp) that could be used for a variety of purposes.</p>
<p>In 3520 NY (−339 DR) , the Elemental Store of Karsus Enclave sold pure elemental iron for 6 gp per ounce.</p>
<p>Iron ore was often conveyed by cargo ships and barges, including spelljammers . Adventurers and other opportunists often overlooked heavy, bulky "treasure" such as iron ore, though in large enough quantities it could be worth their time to carry off.</p>
<h3>Occurrence</h3>
<p>Iron was a common metal found across Faerûn and beyond as mineral sand , various ores, and pure native iron. Different kinds of iron-bearing ore were hematite , limonite , magnetite , pyrite, and siderite . All of them were considered hard minerals and therefore work-intensive to extract by miners.</p>
<p>Iron could be found by how it stained soil and water, giving a distinctive color and taste.</p>
<h3>Refining</h3>
<p>Iron ore was refined by laborious and filthy efforts at a bloomery furnace. One method involved dumping a layer of raw ore into a vertical furnace fed by forcefully pumped air, followed by a layer of limestone flux and then fuel such as charcoal , coal , or coke , then repeated until its own weight threatened to crush the burning coals. The limestone would bind with the non-metallic substance of the ore, separating from the iron into glassy slag tailings. As the ore melted, it would run to the bottom of the furnace and flow out into a crucible called the "hearth" where the slag would separate and float to the top, allowing it to be raked off and separated from the pure iron. The liquid iron was then poured into a series of channels dug into sand , the main "sow" channel lined with numerous "pig" cavities. After the sow and pigs solidified, they were broken apart with hammers and pulled out with hooks , clearing the channels for future castings. Alternatively, the iron could be poured into clay moulds that made specific products such as pots and pans , or into a clay-lined casting ladle that could dispense iron into smaller, more delicate project moulds.</p>
<p>The pig iron would then be further processed into wrought iron, the common form of worked iron. In this process the pig iron was purified of the excess carbon in charcoal fireboxes, making it more malleable and resilient.</p>
<h3>Mining & Trade</h3>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Currency</h3>
<p>Iron was not usually used for coinage due its ubiquity and low value. An exception was the iron steelpence of Sembia , a square-shaped iron coin that came to be used instead of the common copper piece .</p>
<p>The city of Mirabar issued special spindle-shaped 2-pound trade bars of black iron, worth 10 gp within the city and about 5 gp in other lands.</p>
<h3>Spell Components</h3>
<p>Iron was a common material component for spells, especially those that related to toughness or weight, usually in the form of small solid pieces, powder, or filings. Such spells included antimagic field , ball lightning , bombard , enlarge/reduce , flaming sphere , hold person , iron body , iron mind , Leomund's trap , maskstone , move earth , refuge , restore earth , reverse gravity , scintillating sphere , statue , summon golem , wall of iron , warp stone or metal , and weapon of the earth .</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Sarrukh were among the first to forge iron and steel , having mastered the metallurgy as their civilization rose in Okoth around −35,000 DR , and used it to dominate the primitive humanoids of Faerûn .</p>
<p>The Second Age of Calimshan from −3200 DR to −1900 DR saw their armies marching forth to conquer surrounding lands, using a mix of iron and bronze weapons and armor.</p>
<p>In ancient Netheril, Kozah was depicted in art as holding three staves , made of the first iron forged, the first silver forged, and the first tree felled.</p>
<p>In 1101 NY (−2758 DR) , Netheril experienced an economic boom with the discovery of the rich mines of Dekanter , obtaining vast amounts of iron, platinum , mercury , silver, and gold. As the mines were worked out, the empty tunnels were used for magical research and secure storage. Despite their wealth and knowledge, a focus on magical enhancement over metallurgical techniques meant that the civilization made little progress, and advanced ironworking and steelmaking was never achieved.</p>
<p>The Netherese city of Scourge suffered from a strange environmental condition, as the salty wind blowing off the Narrow Sea rusted metal at an extraordinary rate, including magical items. The land around the city was even home to inordinate amounts of rust monsters . In 1754 NY (−2105 DR) , the city came under attack from Shining Tooth clan goblins , whose assault was shattered in part due to their metal weapons breaking.</p>
<p>The Netherese successor kingdom of Anauria was able to supply itself with iron and tin, but didn't have any copper and zinc.</p>
<p>Before the existence of Tethyr , dwarves delved around what would become Velen , finding a little iron ore but not enough to justify settlement.</p>
<p>Keczulla in Amn was founded in 575 DR by the Kczull family during a gold rush that also found iron deposits there. By 755 DR , the mines were played out and the settlement was abandoned.</p>
<p>Citadel Adbar had massive iron spikes atop it that threatened to impale any large, flying attackers (such as dragons ) that attempted to land on it.</p>
<p>From about 1108 DR , the settlement of Dulgund mined iron on Drelvros in the Nelanther Isles . Founded by Dulgund Greatanvil , he and his followers were drowned when a fierce winter storm washed over the island in 1163 DR . The Dungeons of Torment were based in a failed iron mine on the same island.</p>
<p>The Mountain of Iron in Miyama Province of Kozakura was a rich source of iron in the otherwise metal-poor region. Around Kozakuran Year 1279 (1205 DR) , the mines were tapped out and closed, with the mining settlements such as Chizu facing abandonment.</p>
<p>The town of Llorkh grew up around shallow iron and silver mines in the Greypeak Mountains . These mines soon ran out and the town began shrinking, with the Zhentarim appearing to take over the dying settlement shortly after.</p>
<p>In 1368 DR , the Iron Throne attempted to seize control of the iron trade on the Sword Coast by sending agents to sabotage the Nashkel iron mine . They also hired the Chill and Blacktalons mercenaries to disrupt overland caravan trade, and secretly exploited the secret Cloak Wood mine to create their own supply of iron.</p>
