<p>The Library of Netheril was a prominent library and archive in Eileanar .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Library was on the northwestern edge of the city between the Shadow Consortium and Constabulary Branch One .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Library contained an astounding collection of tomes and scrolls on all manner of magical and mundane subjects, though still inferior to those found in Yeoman's Loft . The massive amount of texts were archived and catalogued by head librarian Vincent with the assistance of Linden and Penruddock , and without their expertise it would be impossible to find any particular text. Beltcher , Degliangeli , and Ebrard were three highly knowledgeable historians and the Library's most enthusiastic visitors, who spent much of their time examining the documents within.</p>
