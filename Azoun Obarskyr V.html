<p>Azoun Rhigaerd Palaghard Duar Obarskyr V was the 71 st king of Cormyr , having inherited the throne after the death of his grandfather, Azoun IV ,</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>He was the son of former Crown Princess Tanalasta Obarskyr and Rowen Cormaeril , a scout in the army of Cormyr.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Azoun was just an orphaned babe, and Regent Alusair Obarskyr and Dowager Queen Filfaeril Obarskyr were ruling Cormyr until he came of age. Azoun was cared for by Alaphondar , Royal Sage of Cormyr and lover of Filfaeril. The utmost care was given to keep Azoun's whereabouts a secret, as there were many ambitious malcontents who would wish to do him harm.</p>
<p>When he finally came of age in the Year of Three Streams Blooded, 1384 DR , at the insistence of the royal court, he was crowned king. He immediately set about trying to make various reforms, such as curbing noble's rights, but faced such opposition these efforts failed.</p>
<p>The following year , Azoun had to deal with the effects of the Spellplague and the death/disappearance of a third of his elite War Wizards .</p>
<p>He managed to fulfill his royal duties, however, and married Nalara Marliir , siring two children, Emvar and Foril in 1409 DR . Emvar, however, was later murdered in 1437 DR by Sembians , along with Foril's wife, Jemra .</p>
<p>Two years later, in 1439 DR , Cormyr entered into a two-year-long war with Sembia , now a vassal state of Netheril .</p>
<p>Finally, a peace treaty was made and Daerlun seceded from Cormyr. His original reforms to limit the nobility and empower commoners were finally enacted when he signed the Suzail Writ , which bound the monarch under the law and guaranteed rights like trial by jury of one's peers shortly before his death in the Year of the Godly Invitation, 1449 DR .</p>
