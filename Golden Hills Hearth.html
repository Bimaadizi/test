<p>The Golden Hills Hearth was a festhall in the underground city-state of Blingdenstone in the 14 th and 15 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Rather than a building proper, the Golden Hills Hearth was housed in a sprawling burrow, with an entry door that was sized for those of gnomish height.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>This festhall catered largely to the young, unattached men of svirfneblin society. In addition to favors for coin , the festhall also functioned as a tavern, theater, and casino. Their services were rated by travelers as being excellent and moderately priced, offering up quite the cozy environment.</p>
<p>Any large surface dwellers that came into the establishment would usually find themselves shooed off by the proprietor and redirected to Blingdenstone's local alehouse, the Foaming Mug .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, the mistress of the festhall was one Splitshale . The coin-lasses who worked at this festhall went by the collective title "Ladies of the Golden Hills", which was in reference to the fabled lost goddesses of the Gnome pantheon .</p>
