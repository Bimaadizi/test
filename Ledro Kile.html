<p>Ledro Kile was an elf mage and apprentice to Briella Farthing in the late 14 th century DR who died while on an expedition in the Shining Sea .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , sometime around the month of Flamerule , a group of eccentric entertainers, entrepreneurs, and scientists embarked upon a colonizing expedition to an island they discovered in the Shining Sea off the coast of Chult , which they dubbed the " Forgotten Island ". Led by a charismatic Waukeenar priest named Devlin , they sought to create a tourist attraction on the isle that would attract people from all across the Realms. Three months later, things began to go awry for the expedition.</p>
<p>On Marpenoth 11 , five velociraptors infected with olive slimes attacked the camp's messhall. The group managed to slay them all, but not without the fighter Argus dying and the fighter Mallus becoming injured. The next day Kile's master Briella was sent off with the Chultan Wedonai and the half-elf scout Jarkus to check up on the Sacred Heart of the Beast , an ancient Sunite relic the expedition had brought with them that was supposed to have made docile all of the animals on the island. Sailing off the island began to be considered, but could not be pursued as heavy storms kept everyone else in the campsite for Marpenoth 13 and 14 . When the storms finally let up on Marpenoth 16 , the group went on to the docks and discovered their ships were wrecked, thus stranding them on the island.</p>
<p>Over the course of the next three days, the group became infected with olive slimes due to close proximity with Mallus, who had contracted an infection from the velociraptors. Ledro Kile was seemingly the first to succumb to the infection, as on Marpenoth 17 he was observed by Devlin eating raw a dinosaur in the center of camp alongside Mallus.</p>
<p>On the night of the third day, Marpenoth 19 , Devlin snuck into the barracks and murdered everyone inside. Finding bits of olive slime on all of their bodies, Devlin worked to scrape the ooze off them. He burned the scrapings in a wicker basket and then proceeded to burn the bodies of everyone inside the barracks. Before hanging himself the next day, Ledro Kile's name and the names of the rest of the expedition crew would be recorded by Devlin in the last entry of his diary.</p>
<p>Two days later, Marpenoth 22 , a group of adventurers arrived to the island in search of Briella Farthing and investigated the ruined campsite. There they discovered the half-burnt corpse of Ledro Kile, missing a hand, still lying within the ruins of the camp's barracks.</p>
