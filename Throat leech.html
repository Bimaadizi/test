<p>The throat leech was a deadly parasitic species of leech that could be found in the Realms. An infestation of throat leeches was treated as a severe wasting disease as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Throat leeches resembled small wooden twigs about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) long or smaller.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>If ingested, a throat leech attached itself to the inside of the victim's throat and began sucking blood until it was sated or until it was removed or killed. This led to immediate inflammation of the throat and shortness of breath. It took a full ten minutes to sate a throat leech, swelling as it fed, but during that time the victim had a serious chance to choke to death. Within six hours, an infected creature became severely fatigued, and could no longer rest or recuperate normally.</p>
<p>Consuming water tainted with the parasites could lead to many of the leeches infesting a creature at once. If magical methods like cure disease were not available, the best way to kill a throat leech was to pierce it with a heated wire or other thin, sharp object that would fit into the victim's mouth. The hot wire caused the leech to burst and die. It took a steady and dexterous hand to successfully skewer a throat leech without further harming the victim.</p>
<p>Careful filtering of water before drinking was one sure way to prevent accidental ingestion of a throat leech. One could also prevent ingestion by boiling their water or purifying it through magical means.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Throat leeches thrived in bodies of fresh water.</p>
<p>In Faerûn throat leeches were primarily known to inhabit the High Moor, Cormanthor 's River Ashaba Moonsea lake , as well as the Dragon Reach .</p>
<p>Throat leeches could also be found in the swamps and rivers of Chult and the freshwater areas of the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR, Ravens Bluff resident Skully sometimes sought out and purchased throat leeches. He secretly offered these for sale at his shop, Skully's Bar and Bait , as highly priced fishing bait.</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, throat leeches were one of the more pervasive disease risks in the jungles of Chult.</p>
