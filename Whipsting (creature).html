<p>Whipstings were creatures named for their lashing attacks. They were vicious critters usually found on rocky ledges, in caverns, or amongst ruins in the North.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Whipstings looked like wrinkled, muddy-gray, spheres around 6​ to ​12 inches (0.15​ to ​0.3 meters) in diameter. From two opposite sides of the sphere protruded two long tapering tentacles between 5​ to ​20 feet (1.5​ to ​6.1 meters) in length. These tentacles were very dexterous and were the whipsting's mode of locomotion and hunting. They ended in sticky tips that helped the whipsting in both grasping and climbing. Both tips had a fixed, bony sting protruding at an angle just beside the leathery tentacle tip. Whipstings had many eyes hidden amid the wrinkles in their central sphere, which gave it both normal sight and infravision up to 120 feet (37 meters). On the underside of the central sphere was the mouth, a big sucking orifice dominated by three shark-like teeth set in a triangle. Their teeth could move independently of one another, and were able to gnaw through even plate armor . They could also close their teeth together completely sealing the whipsting's mouth.</p>
<p>They moved by having one of their tentacle curled underneath themselves like a spring and sprang away with a constant bobbing motion. Around one-in-ten whipsting encountered had gauzy, fragile wings, which they could use to glide down from greater heights than they could bounce.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>When prey was near they would lash out with their tentacles, from which they got their name, as their attack would make a whiplike crack audible for 70 feet (21 meters) around. When lashing out, they would attempt to drive an envenomed sting into the prey. The whipsting usually waited for prey with its one spring tentacle ready to lash out, the other fastened into the rock. If they could not hit their prey from where they hid, they would instead propel themselves from their ledge or fissure into a wild spring, ending in lashing their prey with one or both tentacles. They would then attempt to constrict the prey while still pushing their envenomed sting deep into the flesh of their now bound prey. Should whipstings encounter creatures that were large-sized or bigger, they would usually avoid attacking, even fleeing from the area if they felt threatened.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Able to eat any meat, from prey or scavenge, they gorged themselves tirelessly until no more food was present. Their elastic bodies were able to expand up to ten times their normal size to accommodate great masses of food.</p>
<p>They were often encountered in groups who peacefully coexisted. Little was known of whipsting, but they were believed to be hermaphroditic. They would lay eggs much akin to turtle eggs in the caves and dark crevices they themselves tended to inhabit. While the eggs were edible they had no market value.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Whipstings were immune to their own venom . Whipsting venom was effective both outside and inside the body of their prey. When in contact with skin, it would cause nausea and weakness, making any fine dexterity task impossible. Whipsting venom was a known ingredient in the making of rings of weakness and various nausea-inducing medicines.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Some whipstings had successfully been domesticated and used as either pets or guards. In Amn and Tethyr , whipstings would sometimes be imprisoned in small coffers placed atop treasure so as to deter thievery. This practice was rarer elsewhere but not unknown, and was a special favorite amongst certain caravan merchants.</p>
<p>Other more intelligent monsters would sometimes use whipstings to guard their lairs, while perytons and griffons were known to eat them whenever they encountered them. They would bite off the whipstings' stings quickly to avoid the whipsting venom.</p>
<h2>Lands</h2>
<p>Around 1370 DR , whipstings were sometimes encountered in the mountains and caverns of the region called the Savage Frontier .</p>
