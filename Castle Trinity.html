<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>Located high in the Snowflake Mountains and mainly built underground, Castle Trinity was shaped to look like a rocky outcropping, to promote secrecy by repelling intruders and curious eyes.

When Aballister Bonaduce replaced Barjin as head of the sect, he started building walls and towers, diminishing the effect of the inconspicuousness of the architecture.</p>
