<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ephram was the patriarch of the Darano , a halfling clan cursed with lycanthropy . In 1478 DR , he led his fellows to Spellgard , seeking Lady Saharel 's counsel with the hopes of finding a cure. However, during the full moon, an argument broke out and many Darano transformed and killed their fellow family members in a blood-fueled frenzy. Horrified by their actions, Ephram and his surviving fellows abandoned their quest and started living in one of the ruins, preying upon the seekers.</p>
