<p>G'Zhorb , which roughly translated to the All-Seeing Eye in the Beholder language , was a powerful beholder in Undermountain beneath Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>G'Zhorb commanded a horde of beholders in Undermountain, but was himself subservient to Halaster Blackcloak , the dungeon's vastly powerful master. Halaster ensured the loyalty of G'Zhorb and his minions by constructing a magical device that contained a tiny space that beholders were unable to see, threatening to unleash the imperceptible space on all of Faer√ªn . This horrified G'Zhorb, and drove him near insanity, but also ensured he remained a faithful servant of Halaster.</p>
