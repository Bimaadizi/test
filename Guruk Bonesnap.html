<p>Guruk Bonesnap was the leader and self-proclaimed "King" of the ogre gang that inhabited the old tollhouse in the Wild Hills of the Delimbiyr Vale circa 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like many of his kin, Guruk Bonesnap was quite ugly and had poor hygiene and stank of rotten milk and foul body odor. He had misshapen yellowed broken teeth and an arrogant disposition.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>While under Guruk Bonesnap's control, the tollhouse's ogres demanded 3000 gold pieces in exchange for safe passage. Alternatively, the ogre "king" offered free passage to anyone willing to slaughter his hatred gnoll adversaries. The ogre king wielded an enchanted +2 double axe .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point before 1372 DR, Guruk Bonesnap inherited the title and the "crown" from Kolgok Skullcrush , after smashing the ogre chieftain's head. Under Guruk's leadership and aided by a cunning oni mage , the ogre tribe pushed a gnoll community from the old toll house in the Wild Hills. Ogres wanted to become rich off the tolls collected via strength and intimidation. The gnoll chieftain - shaman Rattlefang , retreated with his tribe to a ruined structure and a cavern nearby and called it their fort. The gnolls looked for the opportunity to take back the toll house while Guruk's ogres - to slaughter the gnolls. Both parties requested help from the Hero of Daggerford ; however, the end result remained unclear.</p>
