<p>A bell of Pavlov was a type of enchanted bell that when rung caused nearby creatures to salivate uncontrollably.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These bells had the appearance of small, silver handbells .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When rung a bell of Pavlov affected creatures within a 30‑foot (9.1‑meter) radius, minus the bell ringer themselves. The rate at which the affected salivated impeded their capacity to talk, consequently making it impossible to cast spells that required verbal components .</p>
<p>Additionally, there was a one-in-five chance that creatures affected by a bell of Pavlov would feel compelled to go have a meal, regardless of whatever action they were in the middle of.</p>
