<p>The Steel Blossom was a masterful creation of a renowned swordsmith Anukiru of Kozakura . This blade was commissioned by an unnamed Shogun to symbolize his rule. However, the weapon makes outdid himself and fell in love with the most beautiful blade he's ever created. Anukiru could not part with the katana he named the Steel Blossom . Maddened by the smith's dishonor, the Shogun beheaded Anukiru with the Steel Blossom and reclaimed his commission. It was believed that the enchanted katana did not stay with its new master for long as he was killed in battle soon after.</p>
