<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sofia was a Guild tailor in Waterdeep who was sent to Port Nyanzaru to study Chultan techniques and designs. She arrived in the city with materials and Northern clothing to sell, which she hoped would surprise and delight Chultan buyers. However, all of her wares were promptly confiscated by a customs assessor. This left her unable to do business in the city, and she subsequently sought help from the Master of the Market to acquire replacement goods.</p>
