<p>A tome of understanding was a magical book that contained magically-infused texts that could increase the reader's common sense and wisdom.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tomes of understanding were large, heavy books that contained exercises designed to improve the reader's intuition and insight. The topics and themes of these tomes varied. They could contain scholarly treatises and accounts of legal, philosophical, and arcane subjects, or mental exercises that encouraged new modes of thinking.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Charged within the book's words was a powerful magical enchantment. If the reader completed the book within a period of 6 days, an activity that required a total of 48 hours of reading, the reader was endowed with a great improvement to their intuitive and reasoning capacities, potentially transcending their natural potential.</p>
<p>Once the tome was fully read, its magical power was spent and it became an ordinary book until it recharged after one century, though they were also known to simply disintegrate after use.</p>
