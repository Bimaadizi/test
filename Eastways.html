<p>The Eastways were three tunnels and roads that lead east from the drow city of Menzoberranzan to Fardrimm and Delzoun .</p>
<h2>Menzoberranzan</h2>
<p>The Eastways were three tunnels that opened up in to the cavern of Menzoberranzan at the district of Donigarten . Here they were defended by several scorpion-shaped jade spiders . Nearby was a series of east-west stalactites known as the Spiderfangs which were used by House Barrison Del'Armgo to defend the city against hostile incursion.</p>
<h2>Route</h2>
<p>The Eastways branched out into three main tunnels: the smallest and shortest led to the Driders' Chasm , while the other two led north and east to the Fardrimm and fallen Delzoun .</p>
