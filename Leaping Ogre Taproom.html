<p>The Leaping Ogre Taproom was an eatery on the outskirts of Telflamm found just outside the legal city limits.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was a rambling edifice; services for traders such as stables, warehouses, carts sprang all around it. According to some, caravans headed for the Golden Way used the construction as a touchstone; every morning at dawn, as of the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR , work was assigned to arriving mercenaries. Raidon Kane found out as much that year.</p>
<p>Private rooms were available.</p>
