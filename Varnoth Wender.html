<p>Varnoth Wender was a human resident of the Dragon's Rest cloister on Stormwreck Isle in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Varnoth was a muscular light-brown-skinned woman with short black hair in her twilight years. She had a bunch of scars all across her body. Her left eye bore a scar and was blind. Her right leg, below the knee, was adorned with a prosthetic crafted from wood and metal.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Equipped with a set of mason's tools , Varnoth took charge of maintaining the temple of Bahamut and other areas of the cloister, assisting elder Runara and Rix .</p>
<p>Varnoth came to the cloister library to read its collection of various books and scrolls . She loved to discuss history, ethics, and the impact of individual actions on the world and sometimes did this with Tarak and Runara.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>General Varnoth Wender was once a leader of the mercenary company called Azure Wolves and their name was widely feared in the east. Their fame peaked around the 1471Â DR , after which the injured and exhausted general made the decision to exit the company in pursuit of a life devoted to atonement at Dragon's Rest. Her gruff disposition concealed her remarkable qualities of keen observation and deep empathy. Most importantly, she held faith in giving second chances and finding redemption.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Grinning Halfling, 1481 DR , during her work within the temple, she and Rix bore witness to a ship altering its course and colliding with the northern rocks in the area around the wreck of the Compass Rose .</p>
