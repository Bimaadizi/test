<p>Tiryki Anchorage ( pronounced : / t i ˈ r i k i / tee-REE-kee ) was a ward of the Chultan city of Port Nyanzaru located on the southeast side of the city, outside of its walls. It was considered a slum, and was home to the city's animal-handlers, river folk, and smugglers .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The anchorage sat at the mouth of the River Tiryki , hence its name.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tiryki Anchorage hugged the outside of eastern walls of Port Nyanzaru and extended south where it turned into the pens for the city's dinosaurs . The northern and eastern parts of Tiryki Anchorage featured the docks. Much of the district smelled of sweat and sewage, and the odor of dinosaur manure , wet fur, and tanned hides stretched all the way from the dinosaur pens to the walls of the city.</p>
<p>Buildings in Tiryki Anchorage were largely shanties and hovels made of weathered wood and stone, alongside many market tents and some taller structures. They were connected by filthy stone streets, winding and narrow dirt paths, and dark alleyways. Housing was cheap and sometimes very seedy. The district further boasted a large number of taverns , especially around its ramshackle harbor.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Much of Port Nyanzaru's trade in beasts —notably dinosaurs—occured in Tiryki Anchorage, as did the training of said beasts. By law, both the sale and training of beasts fell under the purview of the merchant prince Ifan Talro'a , and so all legal merchants of beasts were in his employ. There were dozens of these sellers, most of whom doubled as the prince's spies.</p>
<p>The docks of Tiryki Anchorage were virtually unregulated and unpatrolled compared to those of the city's Harbor Ward , and so were quite popular—especially among smugglers—despite the relative lack of resources to help with loading or unloading ships. Those wishing to circumvent the trade monopolies of Port Nyanzaru's merchant princes could find black markets in Tiryki Anchorage. Finding a black market buyer or seller was as simple as asking the right questions to the right people, and it usually took about a half day to track down a new blackmarketeer. However, black market dealings were harshly punished, so any such venture was risky.</p>
<p>Lodging and accommodations were cheaper in Tiryki Anchorage than in most other parts of Port Nyanzaru, and so were popular among visiting explorers.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Because it lay outside of Port Nyanzaru's defensive walls, the people of Tiryki Anchorage relied on the volunteer Citizens' Brigade to keep them safe. In case of attack, a horn was sounded to usher the inhabitants to safety and the residents could rely on the keen senses of the many penned beasts in the district to detect invaders. However, unlike Port Nyanzaru's other slum districts, the Anchorage had no safe havens in which to hide (such as the stone ziggurats of the Old City or the Temple of Tymora in Malar's Throat ), and so their only recourse was to flee to through Tiryki Gate before it was locked.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Tiryki Anchorage was home to some of Port Nyanzaru's poorer residents, including animal-handlers and river folk, along with the more rowdy individuals such as smugglers, adventurers , and explorers.</p>
