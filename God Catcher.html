<p>The God Catcher was a tenement building in the Castle Ward of Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This structure was situated near The Market, at the intersection of Sul Street and Heard Lane .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The building was originally one of the colossal Walking Statues of Waterdeep but in 1385 DR the Spellplague animated all the guardians of the city and they walked around Waterdeep wreaking havoc. The Blackstaff at the time, Tsarra Chaadren , turned the ground to mud underneath the statue and it sank partway into the ground. As mysteriously as it animated, it stopped and settled in the Castle Ward, just north of the Market at the intersection of Sul Street and Heard Lane.</p>
<p>Over time, the statue was hollowed out and partitioned into living quarters. The leg that sank into the ground penetrated a sewer line so a stairway was hollowed out inside of it allowing access to the sewer system of the city. As of 1479 DR , the statue/building was owned by the reclusive sorcerer Aundra Blacklock , who lived in the hollowed-out stone sphere that floated above the statue's upraised right hand.</p>
