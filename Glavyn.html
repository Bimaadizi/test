<p>One rainy spring afternoon in the Year of Laughter, 761 DR , Glavyn tried to turn away a magic user claiming his own name was Wanlorn , who insisted he was there to join Lord Esbre Felmorel at one of his feasts. Glavyn rebuffed the man repeatedly, until the man used a spell to freeze Glavyn's arms in a cross-armed position, and then Lady Nasmaerae Felmorel ushered him in, much to Glavyn's annoyance.</p>
<p>That evening, after the Lady Nasmaerae Felmorel's spells were broken by Azuth , who let her off with a warning, Glavyn was one of the three soldiers that came to the aid of Lord Esbre, on whom an enthralling spell had been broken. Glavyn helped Lord Esbre in forcing her to cast another spell, which as per Azuth's warning, broke her ability to use spells forevermore.</p>
