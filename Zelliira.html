<p>Zelliira was an Eilistraean drow bard and of Eilistraee's Wanderers in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Zelliira had long white hair worn loosely.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Zelliira was deeply upset by the state of relations between the drow who rejected Lolth and the elves of the Seldarine . Despite ostensibly being on the same side, she knew there was still a deep lack of trust and respect between them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Zelliira joined Eilistraee's Wanderers and followed Kelgoth Darksong on his mission to help the Elves of Cormanthor reclaim Myth Drannor . Once there, she led a small party into Oghma 's House of Song , hoping to find the Icon of the Humans . The party ran into many threats as they explored the site, and so Greyarra Auvryath and the other drow retreated while Zelliira pressed on alone. She was unable to face the last challenge, the sphinx guardian Niamh , and dithered until Greyarra sent reinforcements to save her. She was glad that the helpers were able to recover the Icon , and decided to stay behind for a while as she worked on a poem that she hoped would mend the rift in elvenkind.</p>
