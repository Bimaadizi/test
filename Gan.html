<p>Gan was a tiefling child from the city of Elturel , who along with others of his kind, was exiled from the city in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gan wore what appeared to be a bandage over his left eye.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Elturian tieflings were made refugees following the catastrophe known as the Descent that befell the city in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . They were blamed for Elturel's temporary displacement into Avernus , even though they had no association with the Nine Hells beyond their infernal heritage. Not even children like Gan and the others were spared this unfortunate mistreatment.</p>
<p>Traveling westward along the Risen Road , the tieflings were beset by goblins and forced to take refuge at the Emerald Grove . Asharak and the local hero Wyll , the Blade of Frontiers, spent their time training some of the tieflings to better defend themselves. Even children like Gan were included in this combat training. In fact, Gan was particularly enthusiastic about it.</p>
