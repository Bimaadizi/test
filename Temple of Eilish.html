<p>The Temple of Eilish was one of the last surviving structures in Pazar , a city in Raurin . The efreet Khalitharius was imprisoned there beneath the Star of Aga-Pelar .</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Temple of Eilish was beneath the Statue of Kalif Maniozimus ; the temple had actually sunk into the ground after the drying of the Athis, owing to the abandonment of the spells that kept up the city of Pazar. People close enough to read the inscription of the statue were at risk of falling into its dome.</p>
<p>The dome beneath the statue was the only surviving structure of any note; the 100‑foot (30‑meter) tall structure had a 70‑foot-tall (21‑meter) pile of sand in it. The place was crawling with giant tarantulas . A magically obfuscated inscription warned against disturbing the Vanquished One, referring to Khalitharius. The area leading to Khalitharius's imprisonment chamber was magically password locked; the passwords were held in a scroll room.</p>
<p>Khalitharius's imprisonment chamber was warded by three rows of two statues, each of which projected a magical barrier between the statues. The first barrier was destructive cold, the second barrier was a curtain of powerful electricity, and the third one was an extremely powerful flame shield. Passwords would bypass all of those barriers and were found in the same room. Behind all the barriers was the Star of Aga-Pelar, set above an altar of white marble ; that altar was Khalitharius's prison.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After binding Khalitharius in a lead box around the year 350 DR , Martek had it taken to the Temple of Eilish, where it would be kept. He used the Star of Aga-Pelar as payment to the Lord of Pazar for keeping the efreet in there.</p>
<p>In 1356 DR , adventurers sent by Aman Al-Raqib retrieved the Star of Aga-Pelar, releasing Khalitharius in the process.</p>
