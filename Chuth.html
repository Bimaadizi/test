<p>Chuth ( pronounced : / tʃ uː θ / chooth ) was an adult green dragon that lived in the Misty Forest .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Chuth was born in the Ardeep Forest in 942 DR . From his younger days he started to hunt and devour elves . In time Chuth focused himself to hunt mostly elves of royal lineage, always disguised by an invisibility spell and frequently moving from forest to forest in order to avoid being found and killed.</p>
<p>Chuth at one point joined the Cult of the Dragon , and had agreed to become a dracolich in 1373 DR as the Rage of Dragons of that year was expected to last forever. He changed his mind and ate the cultists in his enclave shortly after the Rage ended. Around 1485 DR Chuth was near the Laughing Hollow to hunt prince Alagarthas .</p>
<p>Afterward, despite his previous actions he became the companion of the exiled elf prince and cult member Neronvain at some point after. Together, they coordinated raids against the elvish inhabitants of the Misty Forest until they were eventually defeated by a band of adventurers.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Chuth enjoyed the thrill of the hunt. In his youngest days he believed that eating elves could grant him immortality but in time he abandoned this stupid idea.</p>
