<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The Canaith mandolin , one of the Instruments of the Bards , was named after this college and had been created by the legendary bard Falataer to test and reward his students who achieved mastery of the fourth, or Canaith level of skill in his bardic college. The powers of the original Canaith mandolins could only be properly wielded by bards of at least the Canaith college: bards of lower levels of skill could only obtain limited results.</p>
<p>The Canaith lyre was also named after the college.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The College of Canaith was one of the seven elder bardic colleges dating back to Falataer, who had established it as the fourth level of his bardic college. Following this tradition, bards studying to obtain the rank of Magna Alumnae attended all seven colleges, with Canaith being the fourth, after Doss and before Cli . However, this practice was abandoned once the original colleges declined.</p>
