<p>Rolf was a roofer of the town of Ghars in Cormyr in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was a young man, but big.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Rolf had his heart only on Mayella Meadowbrock , who'd been his friend since childhood. However, she was the daughter of Barthelm Meadowbrock , who disapproved of the lowborn laborer.</p>
<p>The bully Dovo knew Rolf's temper was his weak spot and so liked to insult him and make him jealous by pestering Mayella to get a rise out of him.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Rolf had a short, hot, and violent temper. He got into fights just about every tenday , so much so that his father worried about him.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In around Ches of the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , Rolf was hired by Lukas Spoondrift to repair the roof of the Sheaf of Wheat inn. However, one midnight, heavy boxes of wood shingles left on the roof fell through the floors and rained shingles down on Spoondrift and his wife in their bed. While Spoondrift blamed Rolf, Rolf denied the already rotten beams were his fault. Rolf's father, also a roofer, offered to share the cost of rebuilding, but Spoondrift refused. They took the matter to a magistrate in Wheloon , and argued about it through the rest of the year. Lukas maintained a grudge against Rolf thereafter.</p>
<p>Rolf once apparently almost killed a man in a brawl in Thunderstone . While the other guy started it, Rolf finished it.</p>
<p>After a hard day's work, Rolf and a pair of fellow roofers went to the Bold Bard tavern on the evening of Eleint 16 , boasting he could expose the culprit behind recent sightings of Fastred 's ghost. When he saw the lecherous Dovo harassing Mayella, he intervened, and lost his temper when Dovo insulted him. The two got into a tavern brawl while Barthelm ordered Mayella to leave with him. Tavernkeeper Shortshanks broke it up, Rolf got the blame for starting it, and was roughly thrown out and even billed for the mess.</p>
<p>When Dovo was found dead the next morning , after impersonating Fastred's ghost, Rolf was briefly considered by some as a suspect. Jasper even attempted to test this that evening by throwing a piece of cheese at Rolf to see if he caught it in his right or left hand. The cheese instead hit him in the head and landed in his ale , but Jasper got his answer when Rolf hit him with his right. And again Rolf was thrown out of the Bold Bard.</p>
<p>On Eleint 19 , Rolf was again trying to enjoy a night at the Bold Bard when he and Shortshanks were forced by four Purple Dragons to go with them to a midnight meeting at Benelaius 's cottage. Naturally, they were angry about this. There, Benelaius revealed the murderer of Dovo and Grodoveth ; Rolf was cleared of involvement, despite his hot-tempered interruptions and boldly declaring he'd die to defend Mayella's honor.</p>
