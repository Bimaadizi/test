<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar , Micahrastir lived atop a great pile of coins and other treasures, located on a rocky platform above the trail between the Great Waterfall and Tranquility Grove near Sschindylryn . The great red dragon was rather separate from mundane threats and politics, though the drider Jorenthar Sparskrael strongly desired a sample of the dragon's scales for his experiments.</p>
