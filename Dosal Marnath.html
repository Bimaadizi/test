<p>Dosal Marnath was a spectre within Hellgate Keep around 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Dosal's mind was consumed by thoughts of anger and hate.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As a master spectre, Dosal was able to create spectre servants.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Following the destruction of Hellgate Keep, Dosal spent his days roaming the halls of the fortress's Deep Garrison alongside his three spectre servants, killing any defenseless creature they encountered.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In life, Dosal was a minor wizard living in the fortress town of Ascalhorn. Like many of the town's magic-users, he summoned baatezu to help him gain power. While many did fall by the hands of his minions, they ultimately turned on him around 882 DR when the fortress fell to tanar'ri forces.</p>
<p>Dosal's hatred and outrage over his servants' betrayal was so great that his spirit rose as a spectre. For a short time, he took out his rage on all that crossed his path: baatezu, tanar'ri, and even former allies in life. His rampage ended with him being imprisoned in a gem and left forgotten inside a crypt. When Hellgate Keep was destroyed centuries later, this gem shattered, unleashing him, and he proceeded to torment the nearby tanar'ri and tanarukka . He would later turn the spirits of three tanarukka into his own personal spectre servants.</p>
