<p>Akir Abd al-Himaya was the commander of the Defenders Mamluk Society in Qudra in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Akir and his Defenders were responsible for the security and defense of Qudra. This responsibility actually rotated between the various mamluk societies on a monthly basis, but the Defenders were responsible when the other groups were absent from the city.</p>
<p>Akir Abd al-Himaya did not hold much power on the Mamluk Council , so he often traded favors in exchange for support for his personal goals regarding the Defenders.</p>
