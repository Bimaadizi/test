<p>Traders Bay was the only interior waterway in Impiltur . Because of its reputation as a wretched hive of scum and villainy, it was sometimes colloquially called Traitor's Bay .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Because the coastal port cities along the Easting Reach were sufficient to support legitimate trade, the Bay never gained prominence as a mercantile route. Thus, much of the traffic on Trader's Bay consisted of fugitives, bandits, or smugglers attempting to move between the Cold Lands and the Easting Reach without attracting the attention of Impiltur.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The term "Trader's Bay" referred collectively to the final stretch of the Great Imphras River as it passed through two large lakes, Bluefang Water and Old Water , and emptied into the Easting Reach. The only settlement on the Bay was Bay Town .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to the rise of Zhengyi the Witch-King in the midâ€“14 th century DR , Traders Bay was part of the trade routes of Damaran merchants en route to the Sea of Fallen Stars , but this traffic disappeared with the Witch-King's conquests in the Vaasan War . Even after the restoration of Damara in the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , the only legitimate merchants who chose to travel through the Bay were those desperate to reach the sea as fast as possible, while the rest traveled the safer and better patrolled land route .</p>
<p>By the 1370s DR, shipping traffic had begun moving up the Great Imphras River through Trader's Bay to Heliogabalus , although this trade hadn't reversed the fortunes of Bay Town.</p>
