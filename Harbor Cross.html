<p>The Harbor Cross was a bridge that spanned the River Mirar in Luskan . It was actually two bridges: the Short Span , which connected the city's South Bank to Blood Island , and the Long Span which connected Blood Island to the city's North Bank . The entirety of the bridge was sometimes referred to as the Long Span, and it was briefly known as Blood Bridge in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Of the three bridges that crossed the River Mirar within Luskan (the other two being Dalath's Span and the Upstream Span ), Harbor Cross was the southernmost and therefore the furthest downstream. It continued from Reavers' Run on the South Bank and connected the city market to the Red Dragon Trading Lodge on the North Bank. Blood Island sat in the middle of the bridge, which served as the garrison for Luskan's troops.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When forces led by Deudermont and Lord Brambleberry attacked Luskan to drive out Arklem Greeth and the Arcane Brotherhood in the Year of the Bent Blade, 1376 DR , fierce resistance was expected and encountered on the Harbor Cross bridge. In particular, Lord Brambleberry's forces got pinned down by evocation magic before a large chunk of the Long Span collapsed and fell into the water. Although they won the fight, losses were high and fires on the north end resulted in innocent lives lost.</p>
<p>After Luskan descended into anarchy following the events of the Spellplague in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , Harbor Cross (as well as the other two bridges) was destroyed and could no longer be used to cross the river. In the decades that followed, local gangs would occasionally refurbish it into a makeshift crossing—sometimes as little more than a series of ropes —in hopes of charging tolls. These repairs never lasted and the bridge remained impassable through the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , but it was more effectively rebuilt the following year . This incarnation was known as the Blood Bridge, and was controlled by the Dragonbloods —a Shou gang based on Blood Island.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , the bridge was once again known as Harbor Cross and Blood Island once more housed Luskan's soldiers. Use of the bridge was restricted to members of Luskan's Ships or to those otherwise approved by the High Captains of Luskan .</p>
