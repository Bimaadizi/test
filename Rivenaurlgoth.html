<p>Rivenaurlgoth the Darkly Pious was a red great wyrm who lived in the Marching Mountains of Calimshan in the 3 rd century before Dalereckoning . He was the most powerful servant of Bane of the day.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lost Faith, −284 DR , followers of the god Anachtyr killed the dragon , took its skull and gilded it in gold , and carved the Myth of the Four Rivers into its teeth. Later, Banites stole the skull and kept it hidden to preserve their deity 's fearsome reputation. Over time, the followers of Bane forgot exactly why they were hiding Rivenaurlgoth's skull, but they still felt compelled to keep it so out of greed. As of 1370 DR , the skull had passed into the hands of worshipers of Cyric , who kept it in the Mountain of Skulls in Tethyr . Rivenaurlgoth's skull was considered a particularly holy item of the Church of Cyric , with access restricted to only one worshiper at a time.</p>
