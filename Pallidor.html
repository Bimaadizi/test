<p>Pallidor was a wizard in Icewind Dale in 1485 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Pallidor was the apprentice of Vaelish Gant and a fellow member of reformed Arcane Brotherhood . He followed his master in his plot to conquer Icewind Dale but after arriving in Bryn Shander , Pallidor abandoned Vaelish, following a voice that called to him.</p>
<p>Under the voice's instruction, Pallidor recruited Baerick Hammerstone and his crew to make excavations in Kelvin's Cairn . There they discovered first black ice and later the corpse of Akar Kessell . Kessel, risen as a wight , explained that he was the voice that had guided Pallidor and possessed the young wizard to use as his vessel.</p>
<p>Pallidor likely died when an adventuring party defeated Kessel for good.</p>
