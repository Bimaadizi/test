<p>Metwell Greenwood was a fisher from the Gulf of Lath turned cleric , active in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Metwell was born in a humble family of fishers on the Gulf of Lath of Lantan . He was a short man and the weakest of his family. As a child, Metwell spent his time hauling catch, gutting fish, and mopping the boat's deck. By the age of eighteen, he grew disgusted with fish and decided to become a priest of the god of forests Silvanus . It was an act of teenage rebellion that led him to an adventuring career, far, far away from the much-maligned smell and slime of fish.</p>
<p>Sometime in the 14 th century DR, Greenwood was among adventurers interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed sorceress to retrieve the equally mysterious magical orb from its depths.</p>
