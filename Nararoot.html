<p>Nararoot was a tuber that was used as birth control throughout Faerûn . Much cheaper than cassil herbs , which were used by men, nararoot shavings were taken by women. Nararoot could be diluted and steeped into tea for a more pleasant flavor. Ingesting nararoot rendered the drinker infertile for a week or two.</p>
