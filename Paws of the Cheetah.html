<p>The Paws of the Cheetah were a pair of boots of speed that, slightly differently from others of their sort, doubled their wearer's speed of movement on foot at all times.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>They were used by a deadly assassin from the Sword Coast who chased down his prey at a speed that was faster than a running horse. While the name of this assassin was not known, it was believed that they went on to form a group of elite guards that were each identically equipped with boots of speed . This explained why they were not only exceptionally fast but seemed to appear at multiple locations at once.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , the boots were in the possession of Drasus , and adventurer who worked for Rieltar Anchev of the Iron Throne and was stationed at the old dwarven mine in the Cloakwood .</p>
<p>By the following year, the Paws of the Cheetah came into the possession of Illasera the Quick .</p>
