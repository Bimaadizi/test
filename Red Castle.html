<p>Red Castle was a stronghold of goblins and hobgoblins in Thar . It was home to the Red Claws tribe.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The castle was built out of a massive ruined ogre fortress, and so the doorways, stairwells, and ceilings were far too large for the goblinoids who had come to inhabit the ruin during the 14 th century DR . This led them to construct their own network of stairs and mezzanines within the existing rooms out of stone and timber.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Red Castle was located in southwestern Thar. It was west of the Tormel River and about 20 miles (32 kilometres) north of the Moonsea coast where the road between Phlan and Melvaunt lay.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The walls of the ruined fortress were massive and the Red Claws were one of the larger goblinoid tribes in Thar. A pack of worgs prowled the trails leading to the Castle.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The original structure was built in the ancient days of Vorbyx 's orc and ogre kingdom of Thar.</p>
<p>During the mid-to-late 14 th century, it was occupied by the Red Claws, who dubbed it "Red Castle." Led by the warlord Hashrad , the tribe took advantage of the Castle's proximity to the road to extract tolls and bribes from caravans travelling along the northern coast of the Moonsea.</p>
