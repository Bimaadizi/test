<p>The dinosaur pens of Port Nyanzaru , Chult , were paddocks where most of the city's dinosaurs were housed and trained.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The pens were located in the Tiryki Anchorage district outside the walls of Port Nyanzaru proper. They lay at the southeastern outskirts of the city, but were close enough that the harsh smells and throaty noises of the beasts made their way into the Anchorage. This location also meant that the dinosaurs served as an early-warning system as they would sense the approach of danger from the jungle.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The smelly pens included both cages and muddy enclosures surrounded by 30‑foot-high (9.1‑meter) palisades to keep the dinosaurs separated by species, although some of these walls were only barely strong enough to hold back the creatures they separated. The fences were adorned with decorative Chultan shields , colorful banners, and torches to keep the area well-lit at night. Snaking bamboo catwalks atop the walls allowed trainers to keep an eye on hungry dinosaurs from a safe height.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The pens were the area where Port Nyanzaru's beasts of burden and racing dinosaurs alike were trained and housed at night. Most common among these dinosaurs were ankylosaurus , deinonychus , hadrosaurus , and triceratops , followed by allosaurus and dimetrodon , as well as the occasional prized stegosaurus or tyrannosaurus .</p>
<p>The animal handlers at the pens were highly skilled and worked with the same animals each day. They sometimes used long poles tipped with with blunt iron hooks to corral the dinosaurs. These trainers worked for the merchant prince Ifan Talro'a , who controlled both the sale and the training of all beasts within Port Nyanzaru. He also held authority over the entirety of the pens.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , Ifan Talro'a maintained a small stone bunker somewhere beneath the northern side of the pens. He used this "office" to manage communications with his mysterious allies from deep in the jungle by safeguarding written messages, storing supplies, and keeping flying snake messengers. The entrance was a locked metal door hidden amongst the pens, and the interior was guarded by conjured shadows and shadow demons . A member of the Emerald Enclave named Screaming Wind learned about his activities and strove to discover this office to find the proof.</p>
<p>In the lead-up to the inaugural day of a special dinosaur race known as Na N'buso's Haka , a series of dinosaur racers became mysteriously ill. On the day of the event, it was discovered that racers were being poisoned in their pens with a drug known as Wanderlost .</p>
