<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Branon Oakheart was a recent arrival in Hillsfar from the forest of Cormanthor . He was one of the very few outsiders allowed shelter and entrance to the city during the raging Order of the Crippled Fang crisis. Branon and his companion Cassius were ambushed by a gaggle of fiends summoned by the Order of the Crippled Fang. Cassius distracted the creatures, allowing his friend to escape. The druid assumed his animal companion perished in the process, not realizing that Cassius was an astral creature summoned by a figurine of wondrous power . Branon reached the safety of civilization and ended up locked within the city walls. The druid's healing abilities and his abundant stock of magical trinkets, scrolls , and potions guaranteed him a spot in the market square of Hillsfar. Another outsider allowed into Hillsfar was a Red Wizard of Thay who opened a stall selling enchanted items across the plaza from Branon. The two quickly developed an antagonistic relationship.</p>
