<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Eleasis of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , he and Stag attempted to rob Feena Archwood outside of Yhaunn, not knowing she was a werewolf and a priestess of Sel√ªne . She defeated the two of them handily with her unarmed skills and divine magic , and left them unconscious outside the city.</p>
<p>A tenday later, Drik and Stag came across Feena again by chance at the Cutter's Dip tavern. This time, they turned the bar patrons against her by claiming she was a robber and a wild mage , and easily had her at their mercy as they tormented her with Dip's Stagger . They were interrupted by Keph Thingoleir , who rescued Feena purely out of personal disdain for Stag. After a brief unarmed brawl, Drik drew a throwing knife , but Keph shattered his knee with a well-placed kick, leaving him on the floor of the tavern.</p>
