<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jamison's sling was a rather simple name given to the magic sling wielded by the powerful gnome hero Harl Jamison during his adventuring days with the troupe called the Sons of Green Hills. In his hands, the sling ended the lives of many ogres and goblins in defense of the group's homelands. The sling was interred with Harl Jamison after his death of old age in the Year of the Ruby Pendant, 845 DR . It was believed that the sling was plundered from the hero's grave sometime circa the Year of the Burning Tree, 890 DR , and by the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , it ended up in the hands of a Kieran Nye , a disgraced member of the Arcane Brotherhood who posed as the simple innkeeper and the owner of the Whistling Gallows in the town of Lonelywood .</p>
