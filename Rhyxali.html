<p>Rhyxali , called the Queen of Shadow Demons and the Demon Princess of Shadow , was a demon lord who claimed to rule over the shadow demons . She was also associated with secrets.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Rhyxali was normally an incorporeal form, but her true form, which few saw and lived to speak of, was a tall humanoid female with jet-black skin and six fingers on each hand.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Rhyxali preferred to keep a low profile in Abyssal politics, disliking open combat but valuing information, especially secrets. She had little care for mortals, seeing them only as commodities like livestock.</p>
<h2>Divine Realm</h2>
<p>Rhyxali ruled the 49 th layer of the Abyss , Shaddanon .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>According to rumor, Rhyxali was helping Graz'zt prepare the Nerebdian Vast , the 48 th layer of the Abyss and the one that separated her realm from Graz'zt triple realm, for him to pull an entire Material world into in and conquer it as a fourth realm.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Rhyxali seemed content to rule Shaddanon alone and increase her power through the trade of souls and secrets.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Rhyxali was one of the children of Pale Night , making her the sister of Graz'zt , Lupercio , Vucarik , and Zivorgian. Of her siblings, she was a close ally of Graz'zt.</p>
<p>Rhyxali's second in command was a marilith sorcerer called Viractuth , who organized all the knowledge and secrets gathered by the shadow demons into her vast, shadowy library, which was full of hand-written tomes only she could read. The library's organization pattern was such that only Viractuth understood it and could find anything in it.</p>
<p>Additionally, Rhyxali was normally accompanied by a large shadow demon bodyguard called Kadasha .</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Rhyxali did not have a large cult, as she did not seek mortal worship nor notice its absence. Nonetheless, some few ruined temple in remote locales held services in her name. Undead shadows were also known to worship her.</p>
