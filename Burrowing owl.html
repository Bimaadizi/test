<p>Burrowing owls were a species of owl that inhabited the High Desert of Zakhara , on the plains north of the Range of the Marching Camels .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These owls possessed golden feathers and talons twice the size of normal owls.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Burrowing owls typically lived near patches of ab'i tubers. The owls would use their large talons to burrow several feet into the ground to avoid the daytime heat. They could be found in groups of 2â€“8 individuals. Travelers attempting to harvest the ab'i who disturbed the owls were attacked aggressively.</p>
