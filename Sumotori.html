<p>Sumotori or sumo wrestlers , were bushi who trained in the art of sumo wrestling , characteristically mastered by individuals of great size, physical strength, and lightning speed. Sumotori were professional wrestlers who faced off in one-on-one matches inside a dohyō (a sumo ring), clashing against each other and attempting to outmaneuver or force their opponents to leave the ring and lose the match.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A typical sumotori was a human man who followed the world of law . He was 6 feet and 1 inch (1.9 meters) in height and weighed at least 200 pounds (91 kilograms) and 400 pounds (180 kilograms) on average. These individuals started training at a young age and maintained a strict regimen of training and nutrition. Few sumotori dared to perform acts of evil . Some of the bigger and stronger sumotori could wrestle an ogre or an oni barehanded.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Sumotori matches, or shōbu , were typically a swift affair with a run time of fifteen seconds being considered a long match. The opponents eagerly congratulated one another on a win and shared camaraderie outside the dohyō . The ring was a 15‑foot-wide (4.6‑meter) roofed structure with seating surrounding the center stage. Each win was declared by the referee, and their judgment was always final. As they participated in matches, sumotori advanced to the title of ozeki . This title indicated that they had won at least one shōbu championship, however small it might have been. After they won at least ten championships, they became maku-uchi . Sumotori who reached this rank stopped cutting their hair and tied it in a top-knot style, only to be cut once they retired from sumo, typically at the age of thirty during the danpatsu-shiki ceremony. Lastly, the title of yokozuna was rare, and only the best of the best reached it by winning a grand championship. Individuals who lost eight consecutive shōbu were honor-bound to retire.</p>
<p>They had to commit to a strict diet of a special chanko-nabe stew supplemented with copious amounts of rice twice a day. Apprentice wrestlers were tasked with cooking chanko-nabe for their seniors and the yokozuna .</p>
<p>Sumotori fortified their bodies and spirits with training. Only the physically strongest sumotori could achieve the status of a yokozuna , and as such, many renowned wrestlers either trained in the mountains or came from mountain villages. Living in the mountains promoted a healthy lifestyle: the weather allowed them to train their hips by moving through deep snow and they increased the power of their open-palm punches and hardened their palms against wooden poles called teppō .</p>
<p>Samurai Daimyos considered owning a sumotori champion to be a great status symbol as it took great time, effort, and resources to train, feed, and teach one such champion. Being a patron of a sumo school was considered an honorable deed.</p>
<p>Not all sumotori followed the career of a professional fighter; some chose the career of an entertainer, traveling across the land and challenging local champions to a match with a monetary reward in the end. Some desperate sumotori offered their skills for hire with yakuza or as bodyguards. However, jobs such as bouncer, loan collector, and enforcer were also common. In very rare occasions, sumotori took to adventuring .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>All sumotori were learned in the art of the shōbu ceremony and were skilled cooks. In addition to knowledge, they were highly trained in hand-to-hand and sumo wrestling. They seldomly used enchanted items as they were prohibited from doing so in the ring, but no such law existed outside of the dohyō when they were allowed to use various magic rings and bracers and alike.</p>
<p>Sumotori achieved the ability to use their ki through training and had their minds steeled through mental training. Typically they also achieved a greater vitality, greater than the strongest of fighters . As they grew stronger and more experienced, they learned to temporarily harden their bodies by tapping into the ki energy, making them resistant to bludgeoning damage and even resistant to magical petrification , paralyzation , and being stunned. Another temporary ability gained through their ki was the ability to increase their physical strength through sheer willpower.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>During a match, sumotori wore a traditional type of loincloth called mawashi and nothing else. The loincloth was a tough silk cloth that could be used to lift the opponent.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>The sumo wrestler combat was an intricate but swift affair. The wrestlers mastered a set of forty-eight classical structured and well-defined throws that could be used during the match. Some things were banned in sumo matches, such as punching with a clenched fist, hitting below the belt, bending the opponent's fingers back, ear-clapping, hair-pulling, bone-breaking, eye-gouging, and choking. They were proficient and throwing and hurling their opponents with impressive power. When adventuring, they routinely used chokeholds, powerful iron fist slaps, stunning head slaps, and crushing hugs.</p>
<p>In combat outside of the heavily regulated sport, sumotori still wore no armor nor used any weapons and shields . They did not use weapon oils nor poisons as they had no weapons to coat in these substances. Those sumotori who took to adventuring had limited expertise in handling weapons. They chose one type to specialize in, usually a mace , club , hammer , maul , or tetsubo . Nevertheless, even adventuring sumotori never used weapon oils and poisons.</p>
