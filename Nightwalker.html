<p>A nightwalker was a type of nightshade , a sentient undead monster from the Plane of Shadow , also known as the Shadowfell. It was unnatural and malicious, and it took delight in the corruption and suffering of others. It was a creature of both death and shadows and had enormous powers over darkness.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nightwalkers were the shades of extremely strong-willed and evil mortals whose ancient and unyielding will and malice allowed them to hold their corporeal shape. A nightwalker's body looked as if it was made of shadow-stuff, with a vaguely humanoid form. They were about the size of a house, but were usually no taller than 20 ft (6,100 mm), and their bodies were smooth and hairless.</p>
<h2>Origins</h2>
<p>Some scholars stated that nightwalkers actually originated from the Negative Energy plane . Whenever an unworthy being attempted to tap into that plane of existence, there was a chance they would be killed outright, or (more unfortunately) sucked within and replaced with a nightwalker. The number of nightwalkers in the Shadowfell could be attributed to the connection between it and the Negative Energy plane.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Nightwalkers were capable of transforming humans they killed into bodaks through use of an arcane ritual that warped the void energies of the Shadowfell . This ritual would not work on any other plane .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A nightwalker appeared in the middle of the Shadowstorm in Ordulin on Nightal 6 , in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR .</p>
