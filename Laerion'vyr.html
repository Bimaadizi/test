<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime around the Darkening , Laerion'vyr controlled a sizable group of drow, including driders , lesser priestesses, a draegloth bodyguard, and a cadre of ritualists led by Vur'din that summoned a number of slaadi allies, including the powerful gray slaad Il'tharis the Terrible . The drow had a contentious relationship with a nearby group of subterranean lizardfolk , and their presence may have been discovered by adventurers that plumbed the adjacent Netherese tomb and confronting the red dragon Daeronnax .</p>
