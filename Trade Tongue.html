<p>The Trade Tongue was the common trade language used amongst the inhabitants of Kara-Tur . The people of the continent of Zakhara referred to this language as Shang-Chou .</p>
<p>Due to its purpose, it had only a limited vocabulary, consisting largely of terms for the exchange of goods and currency. It was therefore mostly used by merchants and traders, as well as sailors. However, in the midâ€“14 th century DR , an increasing number of diplomats preferred it for negotiation, for the sake of neutrality and impartiality. However, it was not widespread: most people of Tabot did not know the Trade Tongue or else knew very little of it, necessitating an interpreter for anything more than the most basic communication. Travelers from Petan , like the students of Awang Sophir , used Trade Tongue with thick T'u Lung accents when abroad in Kara-Tur.</p>
