<p>Iron bands of Bilarro were magic shackles that were capable of restraining creatures up to the size of giants .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When not in use, the iron bands of Bilarro took the shape of a small rusty iron sphere 3 in (7.6 cm) in diameter. When deployed, they opened into a series of metal straps that tangled around their intended target.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The user activated the iron bands of Bilarro by speaking a command word and throwing the sphere at the desired target. On a successful hit, the bands were deployed and entrapped the target. Once in place, a sufficiently strong individual could in principle break free and destroy the iron bands through sheer strength, but only with great difficulty.</p>
<p>The bands could be deployed once per day and recovered their power at dawn.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1492 DR , a set of iron bands of Bilarro was used to hold Ott Steeltoes , an operative of the Xanathar's Thieves' Guild , by members of Bregan D'aerthe .</p>
