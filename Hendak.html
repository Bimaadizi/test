<p>Hendak was a gladiator and slave who lived in captivity during the midâ€“14 th century DR . He was previously a warrior, before being ripped away from his life in the North .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was a proud man and quite the skilled combatant.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point, Hendak was captured by slavers and taken to the city of Athkatla . He was forced to fight as a gladiator in the fighting pits hidden away in the slums behind the Copper Coronet inn.</p>
<p>Hendak endured his imprisonment and forced combat for years, at least until the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR . He did his best to keep the other slaves alive and boost their spirits, to limited success. Hendak wanted nothing more than to enact vengeance upon the Coronet's owner Lehtinan and free the others who were enslaved.</p>
