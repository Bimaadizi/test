<p>Haeleth's Horseshoes was a smithy in the settlement of Bargewright Inn in the Savage Frontier in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , owned and run by Haeleth .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It stood at the northwestern end of Bargewright Inn, just next door to Belvyn 's house and facing onto the Mud.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>It was a dark and jam-packed place.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Haeleth's specialty was of course making and attaching horseshoes , not only to horses but to all kinds of hoofed animals. He also made hasps, hinges, and hooks, which he delivered to Waterdeep for sale in the markets there. In general, he preferred to work with sturdy iron than with the finer metals like copper and silver , but was not inexperienced in them.</p>
<p>The smithy had been targeted by thieves on occasion, sometimes while he was sound asleep, but none ever came away with more than a fistful of copper pieces , as Haeleth sent all his earnings to his family in Waterdeep and elsewhere.</p>
