<p>A redwing was a huge dragonfly -like creature bred in High Imaskar as of the late 15 th century DR . They were used to transport both trade goods and passengers on massive gondolas strapped to their undersides.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Redwings were bred to facilitate trade within High Imaskar and the Plains of Purple Dust , where the landscape had become treacherous and hard to navigate following the Spellplague . While much safer than travelling overland, these flights could still be dangerous and frequently employed guards, who in turn became famous for their lack of any fear of heights and their willingness to perform risky aerial stunts in battle.</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the Vengeance Riders kept specially trained redwings stabled on great balconies near the tip of the tower-city of Skyclave . At least four of these redwings were always on patrol around the tower on the lookout for threats.</p>
