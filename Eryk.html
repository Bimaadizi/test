<p>Eryk was an adventuring friend of Thomas C. Quirkilious , the proprietor of Chromatic Scale in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Eryk left the Gate to adventure. In a letter, he reported back to Thomas C. Quirkilious that he recently met a janni trader, who introduced a rare metal to him, called pyrohydram . Eryk was told that the metal was used to craft quality pipes that had a "sonorous and grandiose timbre." He believed that Thomas could craft some masterwork flutes using pyrohydram, so he purchased a bagful of samples to bring back to Baldur's Gate.</p>
