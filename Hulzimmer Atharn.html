<p>Hulzimmer Atharn was one of the magelords of the kingdom of Athalantar .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>He specialized in magic that transformed men into monsters, or at least gained for mages a semblance of beast-powers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He desired to learn the secret of the dragon shape, first asking the elves of the High Forest and later the Archwizard Shandrath . Shandrath firmly rebuffed him and so Hulzimmer became obsessed with defeating Shandrath. In the end, in 222 DR , his fellow magelords agreed to attack the Wyrm Tower but in the spell-battle both Hulzimmer and Shandrath died.</p>
