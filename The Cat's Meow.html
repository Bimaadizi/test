<p>In the late 14 th century DR, a group of adventurers hailing from Ravens Bluff came to the city of Ordulin in search of a man named Aaron Marryck . At the suggestion of the elderly Octavian Spellstone , the adventurers sought out two of Aaron's former lovers, one of them being the High Priestess of The Cat's Meow. There they obtained an audience with the priestess in her private offices, who directed them to where they could find Aaron's other former lover, the ranger Symone Hawks-Talon .</p>
<p>A young Sharessan acolyte, Phaedra Dreamingeyes , had just arrived in the city and temple by the time of these adventurers' arrival.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The High Priestess of the temple was one Daryian Catseyes . A strapping young male Sharessan by the name of Castilian stood guard at the entryway.</p>
