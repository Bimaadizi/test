<p>A message plate was a magic item that could be used to send a message.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>One message plate resembled a gold -hued disc, wide enough to rest on one's hand, with studs around the side. A glowing, colorless, animated image of the one who sent the message was projected above it. It made a plink sound when deactivated.</p>
<p>Another was a silver plate with a mirrored inner part and runes running around the border. The recipient could touch certain runes to prove their identity and activate it. It played only a voice message.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
