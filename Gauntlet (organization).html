<p>The Gauntlet was a law-enforcement company based in the Tears of Selûne in the mid‒14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The company's primary objective was to rid Realmspace of all slave trade and imprisonment of innocent people. Around 1358 DR , the Gauntlet were the self-proclaimed law-enforcement agency of the Tears of Selûne. They were always busy fighting mind flayers and neogi .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The company operated from their updated scorpion spelljammer , the Gauntlet . The ship had magical enhancements applied to all its weapons for increased accuracy, damage, and reach.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The company was founded by Kyriel Alathar Pellinore , a paladin of Tyr . Formerly a member of the Council of Elders of Everlund , he became frustrated by the council's inaction following a mind flayer attack in the city that had claimed nearly 200 people, including his entire family. He then left the council and sought the arcane to purchase a ship that could pursue the illithids. During his search, Kyriel also encountered the other members of the new organization.</p>
<p>The Gauntlet became famous throughout Realmspace after destroying a largeneogi slave trading operation on an asteroid in the Tears of Selûne, which also engaged on humanoid traffic by mind flayers. The company attacked from orbit aboard the Gauntlet and destroyed all buildings on the asteroid, killing nearly all neogi and mind flayers present.</p>
<p>The surviving neogi and mind flayers managed to flee and alert the other members of their species about the attack. As a result, a bounty of over 100,000 gp was placed on the destruction of the company. In addition, the scattered neogi created numerous other trading posts throughout the Tears, with substantially reinforced security.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The company was led by Kyriel. Its compliment also included three clerics : Liasa , Sunea , and Kierie . Three wizards took turns in operating the Gauntlet' s spelljamming helm : Cambrigha , Savion , and Vom . They had six apprentices: Alekra , Vicales , Nogard , Sarden , Chare , and Shardonel . Kyriel also had an apprentice called Ansalok . The seven apprentices were tasked with ship's maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<p>Despite internal bickering and occasional disagreements at times of peace, the members of the Gauntlet operated toghether in great harmony when it was time to fight.</p>
