<p>The Errant Thoughts were, alongside the Minders and the Lore Filchers , one of the military branches in charge of the defense of the illithid city of Oryndoll in the Darklands in the 14 th century DR . They were charged with directly defending the city's environs and were the division that would be dispatched by the Elder Concord to strike at foes of the city.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Like the two other branches of Oryndoll's defenders, the Errant Thoughts were led by an experienced illithid vigileator holding the office of High Vigileator and answering directly to the Elder Concord.</p>
<p>Considering their rather martial orientation, the Errant Thoughts were unsurprisingly closely associated with Oryndoll's Tamer Creed .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The bulk of the Errant Thoughts' activities was to patrol the Underdark wilds surrounding the city for up to 20 miles (32 kilometers) away. They were generally in groups consisting of one to three illithid vigileators leading a mixed group of twenty to thirty troglodytes , lizardmen , and tren thralls, with the common addition of either a couple of tzakandi or a trio of intellect devourers , whose role was to detect and neutralize any spellcaster or psion encountered.</p>
<p>In times of trouble, the size of those patrols could be bolstered to twice or thrice their standard numbers.</p>
