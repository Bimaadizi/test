<p>The Field of Tears was a plot of land in the Shining Plains , the site of a historic battle of 326 DR between Ormath , Lheshayl , and the Tenpaw tribe.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Year of Secret Slaughters, 326 DR brought a bloody conflict over the Shining Plains and grazing pastures of the Plainsteeds . Ormath and Lheshayl, of the Three Free Cities of the Shining Plains , turned disputes into an armed conflict. Two armies, totaling 25,000, spilled blood for over two weeks onto the land plot, which would later be known as the Field of Tears. Eventually, warriors of the wemic Ten-Paw joined the fray, driving the human armies away.</p>
<p>By the 14 th century DR , the Hill of Memories was selected on the Field of Tears by the inhabitants of the Shining Plains to hold remembrance vigils. Annually, in the month of Tarsakh , the leaders of the Three Free Cities of the Shining Plains met with the leaders of wemic, centaur , and thri-kreen tribes. The gathering showed respect to those fallen in the faithful battle centuries before, keeping the bloodshed fresh in their minds and for the war never to be repeated. The Emerald Enclave sent delegations to the Hill of Memories to show respect and reverence. Leaders also used the gatherings as a summit, discussing issues that troubled the Shining Plains region. Frequently, a consensus was reached, be it an internal resolution or with a hired adventurers' service.</p>
