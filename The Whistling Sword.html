<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Whistling Sword was crafted by a human blacksmith in a small village in the Eastern Shaar . Although he was a gifted craftsman, and an even better whistler, his local community could not look past his near dwarf -like stature, and he was treated with ridicule instead of praise. His talents went unappreciated save for his one true friend: a reclusive mage . The light-hearted blacksmith eventually grew tired of the mockery and made plans to leave the village behind, but not before crafting The Whistling Sword and having his mage friend enchant it to whistle sweetly. The blacksmith gave the sword as a gift to his friend, who eventually also left the village, taking the sword with him.</p>
<p>As of 1368 DR , The Whistling Sword was carried by the hobgoblin bandit Zargal , who resided southwest of Beregost on the Sword Coast .</p>
