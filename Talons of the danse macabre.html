<h2>Description</h2>

The talons of the danse macabre were indestructible in combat, but could be dismissed with the proper command word or a successful dispel magic spell .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These magic items were initially created by priests of Assuran in Chessenta . Eight pairs were created.</p>
