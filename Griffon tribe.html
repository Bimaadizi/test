<p>The Griffon tribe was a Uthgardt barbarians in the North . Around 1370 DR , they were led by the charismatic chief Kralgar Bonesnapper . Under his leadership, the tribe strove toward many greater accomplishments, making them among the most powerful of the Uthgardt.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1372 DR , the Griffon ancestral mound was Shining White .</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>They declared war on the cities of the North, with their eventual goal being the conquest and acquisition of one of the region's cities. Scattered, un-allied clans that typically sought benefits from these cities often preferred to join the Griffon tribe, increasing their ranks dramatically, so much so that the Griffon's Nest , the tribe's main encampment, rivaled even some of the smaller cities of the north.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Despite the fact they were perpetually at war, the tribe welcomed outsiders, considering all possible potential allies in their quest. Among these allies were orcs that were hungry for plunder, wizards who held personal grudges against particular city-dwellers, and agents of distant empires seeking chaos in the region for one reason or another.</p>
