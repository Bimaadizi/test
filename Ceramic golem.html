<p>A ceramic golem was a type of mineral golem that was formed from various pieces of ceramic pottery stacked together.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>From afar, it looked like a pile of broken pottery, being whatever ceramic items they were made of. These items were put into the shape of a humanoid and animated.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Because of the brittleness of ceramic pottery, such golems were especially vulnerable to weapon attacks. These constructs attacked with their jagged edges. Their fist strikes were strong enough to create concussions and they could charge opponents, albeit clumsily.</p>
