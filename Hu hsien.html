<p>Hu hsien were a type of shapechanging feminine spirit native to Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hu hsien could take one of two forms, and could shapechange freely between the two. The first form was that of a fox with rusty or silvery fur, though unlike a fox a hu hsien could stand on her hindlegs and hold objects with her front paws.</p>
<p>The second form was that of a human maiden of exceptional grace and beauty, with long and flowing hair and wearing silken robes. However, they retained a fox-like tail in this form, though they typically took care to hide it under their robes. In this form, hu hsien were about 5 feet (1.5 meters) tall.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Hu hsien were cunning, manipulative, and cruel, though not entirely ungrateful to those were were generous or kind to them. They valued wealth.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Hu hsien could use a number of spell-like abilities at will, including ones akin to: become invisible , polymorph self , disguise , chameleon , know history , hypnotism , read magic , comprehend languages , ventriloquism , apparition , ESP , and hypnotic pattern . Once per day, a hu hsien could use spell-like abilities akin to possess , servant horde , and major creation . Thrice each week, one could use either reward or ancient curse . While in human form, a hu hsien had the power of fascination .</p>
<p>Hu hsien also possessed certain defensive abilities: they could only be harmed by strongly enchanted weapons, possessed limited regeneration, were immune to fire, and were resistant to the cold and ice. However, they were vulnerable to electricity.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Hu hsien were lesser spirits and cousins to the hengeyokai . They typically lived around the outskirts of human villages, inhabiting either abandoned houses or normal fox dens. They used their illusory abilities to create the illusion of a manor of great wealth and luxury on the inside.</p>
<p>Hu hsien were always dangerous, for they lived by draining the life force of humans. First, a hu hsien would would her fascination ability to make a victim fall in love with her, then feed on their life energy . Because the victim was madly in love with the creature they would not realize what was happening; once the process began the victim could only be saved by either destroying or driving away the hu hsien.</p>
<p>However, hu hsien were also capable of rewarding those who were kind to them, most often with good fortune, success on an examination, or rescue in a moment of danger. They were also attracted to scholars, both as friends or as victims; if a scholar managed to befriend a hu hsien (typically by giving her regular offerings of gems and coins ), they could request the hu hsien's help with research by lighting a stick of incense in their study and leaving the room for the night. When the scholar returned in the morning, the hu hsien might have left a particular volume or document displayed more prominently than before, and which contained the information they sought.</p>
<p>Hu hsien, because they valued wealth, were sometimes worshiped by wealthy people who attributed their own material success to the spirit. Worshipers would build a small clay shrine bearing the image of a fox embracing an elaborately-dressed human near their mansion, and give offerings of coin, gems, and/or prayers daily.</p>
<p>Hu hsien had a weakness for wine of all kinds, and a tendency to revert to their fox form when drunk.</p>
<h3>Homelands</h3>
<p>Outside of Kara-Tur, hu hsien were known to occasionally be found in the western regions of the Hordelands .</p>
