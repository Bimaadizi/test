<p>Garnet was the generic name for a variety of crystals that had the same properties but came in a wide range of colors.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Garnets came in many colors (see gallery ) but, as of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the violet hue was the most valuable and called rhodolite while the other varieties and fallen out of favor and were valued in the fancy stone price range. In later years, even the violet hued stones dropped in value.</p>
<p>Garnets formed isometric crystals with twelve or twenty four faces, though thirty six or forty eight face versions have been found. They were common across the North and could be found in marble , granite , and other metamorphic rocks .</p>
<p>A typical violet colored specimen once had a base value of 500 gp but eventually joined the red and brownish-green versions at a base value of 100 gp.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>If mounted on a weapon and properly enchanted, garnets could double or triple the damage dealing potential of that weapon. The most propitious time of day to begin these weapon enchantments was high morn .</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>In some faiths and folklore, garnets were considered the solidified blood of the divine avatars. To the uninitiated, garnets had the reputation of being worthless for magical use.</p>
<p>Garnet was a common stone among the drow, a gem worn by drow of average station. There was a distinction regarding color preference depending on the profession of the wearer. Deep red was favored by warriors, while the priestesses of Lolth favored violet ones</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1479 DR , Renaer Neverember created rings inlaid with garnets to give to all of his friends whom he wished to participate in an organization he created to replace the Moonstars .</p>
