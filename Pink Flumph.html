<h2>History</h2>
<p>The theater was originally owned by Algondar Daliano and passed on to his wife Iokaste after his death sometime in the late 15 th century DR .

She delegated all artistic and management decisions to the theater's directors.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The violet faerie dragon Wishes was originally Algondar's companion and continued working in the theater following his death. The dragon used its magic to provide special effects for the plays and donated all its earnings to Waterdhavians in need, by flying throughout the city while invisible and leaving coins at different locations.</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, notable performers at the Pink Flumph included the drag queen Chaotic Eva , the bard Florizan Blank , and the actress Yaliek Iltizmar .</p>
