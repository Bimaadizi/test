<h2>History</h2>
<p>In spring of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Gameliel's blightspawned volodni deceived Briartan and gained access to the Mucklestones. With their help, Gameliel captured Briartan, acquired the Keystone and took over the standing stones, which he intended to use to expand the reach of the Rotting Man. When one of his uthraki spies was slain by Araluen roughly a week after, he learned through a mental link that Marrec and his companions were coming towards him. He was ready for them when they came, but Ususi Manaallin slew him with a scroll of disintegrate after a short fight.</p>
