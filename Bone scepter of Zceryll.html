<p>The bone scepter of Zceryll was an artifact created by Zceryll .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The bone scepter of Zceryll looked like a human femur, but its surface resembled a nebula full of stars in inky darkness. Some celestial objects were recognizable in it, and they moved in accordance with their counterparts in the sky.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The scepter could be used to strike at foes; anyone so struck became briefly vulnerable to all psychic damage dealt to them in any way. The scepter could also be used to launch a powerful assault at a target's psyche from a distance; this was damaging, and could soon kill one who did not manage to shrug off the attack.</p>
<p>However, any ability of the wielder to reduce psychic damage upon them was similarly eliminated for as long as they wielded the scepter. Finally, if someone was to die in possession of the scepter, then, upon being returned to life, the sorceress Zceryll would return alongside them.</p>
<p>The dragon Arsekaslyx managed to use the rod to render herself immune to the effects of the Dracorage , but this caused her to mutate.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The artifact had been created by the alienist sorceress Zceryll . As of 1373Â DR , it was in the possession of the dragon Arsekaslyx, who had employed it to stave off the Rage of Dragons that year. However, the process rendered her an aberration , as a pseudonatural creature.</p>
