<p>The Dun'Robar Weapon Master set were a varied collection of enchanted masterwork weapons produced and used by House Dun'Robar of Sschindylryn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The weapons were universally exceptional-quality and matte black implements. It included drow -style weapons like bastard swords , daggers , greataxes , khopeshes , light maces , longswords , mauls , quarterstaves , rapiers , scimitars , shortswords , and warhammers , as well as dwarven waraxes made for duergar soldiers. Though their craftsmanship was some of the best in Faer√ªn , few would be foolish enough to try to steal one from those who possessed them.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Dun'Robar weapons were made even more deadly with a variety of magical enhancements that improved the strikes and tactics that the wielder could use.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Many of these weapons were destroyed or stolen by Cormyrean forces when they raided House Dun'Robar as a counterattack during the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar . The loss of these weapons and their house members severely damaged Dun'Robar's reputation in the city, weakening the alliance between them and House Szind and House Avithoul that led the drow war effort.</p>
