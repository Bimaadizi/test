<p>Old Pappa Floonbat's Patent Medicinal Hair Restorer was a common magical ointment, patented in the Blade Kingdoms by its inventor, Old Pappa Floonbat sometime before 1217 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Each bottle of the patent medicine came with instructions written on its label. The bottle was to be shaken vigorously, then generously splashed onto bald spots and gently massaged in.</p>
<p>Old Pappa Floonbat's Patent Medicinal Hair Restorer likely did not work on feathers, and most definitely did not grow back tailfeathers on an embarrassingly plucked firebird 's backside.</p>
