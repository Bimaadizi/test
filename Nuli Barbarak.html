<p>Nuli Barbarak was the half-dwarven wife of Ivus Barbarak , with whom she ran the Holdfast Inn of Liam's Hold in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nuli Barbarak appeared to be as short as a dwarf ; this height she owed to her mother, who was a human of shorter stature. She had a tough stout body and long dark hair. Nuli was efficient and strict.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At a young age, Nuli Barbarak's father left his child and her mother to fend for themselves in life. The dwarf preferred the life of searching for gemstones to family life. She had a tough life with a single parent, and in adulthood, she often thought of her father, but the thought always put Nuli in a foul mood. After Nuli married Ivus Barbarak, the couple spent their time running the popular inn in Liam's Hold. Nuli worked in the kitchen and dealt with orders and inventory, while Ivus greeted the guests and served them libations and meals.</p>
<p>In 1372 DR , Nuli Barbarak prepared a barrel of the inn's best ale to be delivered to Rab Bitnez 's home for a party. The Hero of Daggerford volunteered to make a delivery, knowing how busy the innkeepers were.</p>
