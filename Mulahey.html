<p>Mulahey was a half-orc cleric of Cyric , and a member of the Iron Throne during the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Prior to the iron crisis of 1368 DR , Mulahey was sent by Tazok to sabotage the Nashkel mines on behalf of Sarevok Anchev and the Iron Throne. He set up his headquarters in the lowest level of the mine, and started sending kobold minions up to poison the iron from the mine with mineral poison provided by his superiors. This scheme helped to orchestrate an iron shortage throughout the Sword Coast which the Iron Throne then used to its advantage. The seizing of the mines encouraged marauding parties of xvarts and kobolds to make raids on local livestock in the nearby lands.</p>
<p>At some point during his tenure as the overseer of the Nashkel mines, Mulahey imprisoned the elven enchanter Xan and took possession of his moonblade .</p>
<p>Against orders given by Tazok, the kobolds began attacking and killing the miners, unbeknownst to Mulahey who kept himself hidden in a makeshift throne room beneath the mines. Despite his relative absence, or perhaps because of it, Mulahey's superiors were displeased with his performance and he lived in fear of the assassins he expected to encounter any day. Eventually the entire operation was stopped by a group of adventurers in the year 1368 DR .</p>
