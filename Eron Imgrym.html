<p>Eron Imgrym was a mage of Sheirtalar of the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Although young, Eron achieved quite powerful spells , which he used freely and violently to slay a lot of other mages and claim their magic .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Bow, 1354 DR , Eron ambushed the current Magister , Imrul Athelzedar and his apprentice Nouméa Drathchuld , with absolutely no warning or formal challenge. In a near instant, the Magister shielded Nouméa with his own spell, Athelzedar's rest , and told her to stab himself and their assailant with her dagger as his and Eron's spells fueled the rest, bound them together, and consumed them, thus, ensuring their deaths and her ascension as the new Magister of Mystra .</p>
