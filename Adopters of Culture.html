<p>Adopters of Culture was a book that discussed culture of half-orcs , written by Penelope Ringwarble and published in the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>Adopters of Culture claimed that half-orcs, as a people, had not a one home among them, hailing from everywhere. By Penelope Ringwarble's definition, culture being like gumbo , a type of stew from Ravens Bluff , half-orcs' upbringing an place of birth dictated how they behaved later in life. The book claimed that half-orcs were a diaspora that lacked a home and, therefore – lacked their own culture. Penelope found that fact quite wonderful how varied half-orcs were in the cultures they adopted but wondered how it would affect a half-orc to be forced to adapt to a new home.</p>
