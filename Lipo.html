<p>Lipo was a yikarian city located along the coast of Pearl Bay near the edge of Zakhara 's northern border in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Lipo was the seat of power for the Coral Princess , the yikarian governor of the Sun's Eye province. The city received many pilgrims eager to commune with the Faceless God at the Shrine of the Jade Monolith , or at least to have a yak-men intercede on their behalf.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Given Lipo's distance from the heart of the Yikarian Empire , and their closer proximity to other cultures, the yak-folk of Lipo were not viewed with as much disdain as their mountainous brethren. Because of this, Lipo was able to trade freely with barbarians from the north and other traders sailing the Great Sea .</p>
<p>Lipo also served as the only naval base for the Empire, docking just five ships. Despite its size, the yikarian navy was quite powerful. They patrolled the coastal waters for smugglers and transported their kin to the barbarian lands to the north, as well as to secret locations along the coast of the Free Cities of Zakhara and as far south as Qudra .</p>
