<p>Grand Arcanist Darstil Vurusk was a powerful wizard and senior officer of the Night Brigade gang in Wheloon Prison in Cormyr in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Darstil had pale skin and short messy dark-brown hair.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The Grand Arcanist was thoroughly detached from conventional morality and only had a tenuous connection to reality. His main passion in life was his magical experimentations, which usually involved maiming, tormenting, and killing people and animals, to an extent that bothered even his fellow gangsters. He found his mistress Storna Harnwood unbearably stoic and restrained, and he believed that one should hurt the innocent while cackling wildly and enjoying life, not silently enduring it.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Among his treasures were his bespoke gloves and bracers of magic and method , as well as the cranium sphere , the cold of night and Lesser Oblivion .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Despite being completely unhinged, Darstil was an exceptional wizard, able to perform astounding feats of magic. Much of his passions were devoted to his laboratory work, which involved magically, surgically, or psychologically mutilating various people, animals, and monsters in highly creative ways that sickened even the Night Brigade. He also took time to train other members of the Night Brigade as wizards, and used his talents to create servile monsters that spied upon the rest of the prison for the gang. Despite being a leading figure, he was mostly ambivalent about the rest of the gang and resented actually working with them, since it took him away from his personal projects.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Darstil became a leading figure of the Night Brigade gang, though he spent most of his time locked in his tower . He tortured and killed all sorts of people and creatures brought to him, including having an elaborate maze built that had no accessible exit. As a powerful wizard in Storna Harnwood 's pocket, and a generally terrible person, the Riverside Rats targeted him for assassination. Wyshbryn Saldar sent a team of allies into the tower to slay him, and though they got stuck in the maze for a time they eventually escaped and put the mad mage down.</p>
