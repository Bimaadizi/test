<p>The Temple of Tyr was a small temple in Bezantur , Thay dedicated to the god Tyr .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Bezantur was known as the "City of a Thousand Temples", and appropriately, the Temple of Tyr was surrounded by temples to other deities . It lay southeast of the city center with the Temple of Bane immediately to its north, the Temple of Lolth to its east, the temples of Leira and Gond to its south, and the Temple of Tempus to its west.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The congregation was quite small owing to the lawful Tyr being generally unpopular in Thay. As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , the temple was led by Mytura Shebala and staffed by a dozen warrior-priests .</p>
