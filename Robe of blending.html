<p>A robe of blending was a wondrous item that allowed its wearer to blend in, either by appearing as part of a wall or plant, or by appearing to be a creature of the wearer's choice.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A robe of blending appeared as a completely ordinary robe and could not be detected by any form of magic. However, the moment someone put the robe on they would realize that the robe had special properties and would gain an innate understanding of how to use it.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The robe could be used to hide, either by being near-invisible or by almost perfectly mimicking any race or gender the wearer wanted. Only those of exceptional intelligence had a minuscule chance of noticing something wrong when looking at the wearer.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
