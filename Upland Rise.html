<p>The Upland Rise was a forested hill that marked the northeastern edge of the city of Neverwinter .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Upland Rise historically served as a natural park for the people of Neverwinter. Mists from the Neverwinter River would gather around the base of the hill during the night.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the decades following the eruption of Mount Hotenow , Dagult Neverember sent loggers and engineers to harvest the trees on the Upland Rise for lumber to rebuild the Neverwinter docks . By the late 1470s DR, the hill had been completely deforested and stripped of its natural beauty, leaving it a wasteland dotted with stumps.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Dark Circle, 1478 DR , the Red Wizard Dhafiyand set a trap for members of the Nashers by luring them to the Upland Rise at night. There, he attacked alongside ash zombies and stole the Crown of Neverwinter from them.</p>
