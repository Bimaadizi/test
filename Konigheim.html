<p>Konigheim was a city and kingdom in the Utter East of southeast Faerûn . It was one of the Five Kingdoms of the Utter East.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It stood near the southernmost river of the Utter East, south of Doegan and north of the Web Mountains (part of the Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains ) and the Land of the Yak-Men . The town of Vanesci Hamlet lay in eastern Konigheim, lying upriver. Beyond it, the Phantom Pass led to the Kingdom of Nix .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Konigheim was a city of cobblestoned streets with the occasional park or monument, tiled plazas, and crenelated forts and short towers. In the northwest, an aqueduct curled through the city to supply water, while a round keep stood in the southeast. The buildings were constructed of stone and had chimneys, with wooden doors, window shutters, pillars and beams, and roofs, and all seemed to burn really well.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>The Bloodforge Wars</h3>
<p>King Grewe of Konigheim discovered the first of the bloodforges in the Year of the Dancing Daggers, 648 DR . These ancient devices of war could mass-produce entire armies of living golems , eliminating overnight the cost of mustering and maintaining armed forces. Within tendays , more were found across all the Five Kingdoms. Losing all restraint, turning war-mad, the Ffolk rulers of the Five Kingdoms each manufactured great golem armies and marched them against one another, bursting into the Bloodforge Wars .</p>
<p>Garrulos and Wormskull were a pair of feuding, treasure-hunting brothers who delved into an ancient barrow tomb and discovered the Pearl of Power , an artifact that could make arcane inventions come alive. Garrulos immediately snatched it for himself, cheating his artificer brother of the glory, and took it to Konigheim to present to the king, "for safekeeping". Incensed, Wormskull tried to seize back the Pearl, triggering the Nuts and !Bolts ( sic ) conflict, which saw Konigheim itself attacked and devastated.</p>
<p>Afterward, a Festival of Talos was held in the city, but somehow this tribute to the god of destruction turned to disaster. Another fire started in the heart of the city, spread swiftly to nearby buildings, then grew into a huge blaze that threatened to destroy all of Konigheim. The leader of the Legendary Campaign discovered the arsonist Illnar Dreth was the culprit and decided to punish them in a bloodforge battle amidst the burning city.</p>
<p>Later, when the Legendary Campaign leader rested in Konigheim, the mage Gareth Gimorrin attacked with a rain of fire in an effort to stop the campaign. Alerted by a watchman, the leader fought Gareth in a bloodforge battle through the once-again blazing city.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the Bloodforge Wars, Konigheim was watched over by a benevolent order headed by Saja Stillwater . They were capable combatants and nigh invulnerable whilst occupying the keep. However, yet another catastrophic fire swept through the city, drawing Stillwater's order out into the streets. The Legendary Campaign leader seized the opportunity to strike in a bloodforge battle.</p>
