<p>Relias Blackseed was a halfling master maker of musical instruments who lived circa early 11 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Relias' renown came from his creation of the Cittern of War . The instrument was blessed and enchanted by the clerics of the Church of Arvoreen , making it a truly remarkable magic item. Despite the Cittern of War being masterfully crafted, Relias did not create it for personal use. It was sold to the bard named Gallow Deely , who used the cittern to compose many a song about adventurers and their heroic deeds.</p>
