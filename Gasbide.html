<p>Gasbide was a myconid architect and leader of the Circle of Builders in Neverlight Grove in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>A loyal follower of Phylo , Gasbide was corrupted by Zuggtmoy and began dreaming of bizarre, elaborate structures no myconids would ever need, which were inspired by visions of Abyssal palaces.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When, circa 1486 DR , Zuggtmoy's will twisted most of the Circle, Gasbide fell to madness and began to become curious about buildings on the surface. He had the aim of constructing, maybe with the help of Araumycos , a tower taller than Yggmorgus that could possibly connect the Underdark to the surface.</p>
