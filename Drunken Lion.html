<p>The Drunken Lion was an alehouse located in the city of Archenbridge during the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . It was a dangerous place that served cheap drinks and cheaper food.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This tavern was located on the intersection between Fairwind Street and the road coming from the Arkhen Bridge.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The place was sparsely and rudely furnished, with tables resilient enough to endure the regular brawls that plagued the place, and to support the weight of hired dancers.</p>
<p>The cheap drinks and bad food attracted an unfriendly crowd of loggers, shepherds, trappers, Ridesmen and poor travelers. The place was always crowded and smoky, and the dancers rather unattractive.</p>
<p>The Drunken Lion was a dangerous place: customers who started fights deliberately were served drinks laced with sleeping potions , and were found the next day in the River Arkhen freed from their valuables. In addition some dancers were known to use bolas to catch thieves or patrons that tried to leave without paying.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Customers at the Lion could get served a varied selection of drinks such as ales , cheap wines , and zzar . One could also get some nibbles there, such as hard biscuits and wormy cheese handwheels . A draft was sold for 4 cp , and flagon of cheap wine for 2 sp .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The best-looking dancer amongst the staff, a half-elven woman named Jalandyl o' Stars , was rumored to be one of the owners of the tavernâ€”but the employees refused to confirm this.</p>
