<p>Shoonach was the former capital of the Shoon Imperium , located on the border of Calimshan and Tethyr , and claimed by both.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Work on Shoonach started as a ploy by King Amahl I to re-garrison the Calishite troops sent to keep an eye on him by his grandfather Akkabar Shoon . Construction began on the site of Iltakar , the capital of the old kingdom of Mir . Surprisingly, Akkabar supported the construction and, when Amahl I was assassinated, construction continued with the stones and slave labor taken from Ithmong when that city was destroyed to prevent an uprising from angry Tethyrians .</p>
<p>By 1369 DR , the Twisted Rune had placed a magical gate in the area to allow for instantaneous movement to other locations.</p>
