<p>Bistal's Bottom , or simply the Bottom , was a small village in Turmish , Vilhon Reach .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bistal's Bottom was a collection of humble scattered buildings. The visitors of the hamlet were greeted by the village's name painted on a side of a mill. The settlement was lush with trees and gardens, perched on the side of a hollow turned a millpond.</p>
<p>Notably, the village was under protection of Oghma the Father of All Knowledge, a deity who served under Mystra . The god of knowledge kept the village safe because of the Cave of Memories , hidden underneath.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Bistal's Bottom was located in the heart of Turmish, to the southeast from the town of Peldrathan's Pool and connected to it via a trail. Other neighboring cities included Zustild , far to the south, Moonhunt Down , to the north-east, and Nonthal to the east.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bistal's Bottom was named after the person who owned a hollow around which the town grew. With time, the hollow was turned into the village's millpond.</p>
<p>Over the years, many adventuring bands, wizards , priests , and mercenaries tried to claim an ordinary-looking rocky hill in the village. Every single one of the would-be conquers found themselves aimlessly wandering the outskirts of Bistal's Bottom, affected by feeblemind magic. Since the village's founding, many children were lost after wandering too close to the strange hill and into the cavern at its summit. The defensive magics of the Cave of Memories sent these unwitting children to an unknown destinations far across the land never to be seen again. Because of these disappearances, locals believed the hill to be haunted.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Notable Inhabitants</h2>
