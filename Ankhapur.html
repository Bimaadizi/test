<p>In 1366 DR , Manferic III ruled Ankhapur with an iron hand and a touch of sadism. He became a lich and sought to inhabit the body of Janol Famisso , a bastard son of his. In his attempt, Manferic killed his other heirs while controlling Janol's body in order to inherit the throne from himself. However, thanks to a cleric of Lathander , Lissa , and others, Manferic was destroyed by Janol and his allies.</p>
<p>With no other heirs left, Janol took the crown.</p>
