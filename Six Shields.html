<p>The Six Shields was an inn in the town of Llorkh in the 1360s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It opened some time after the Zhentarim takeover of Llorkh in 1357 DR , less than a month after the only inn in town burned down after its owner died. Townsfolk were pressed into the construction of two new but ugly inns. The Six Shields was in business by 1366 DR and through 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A three-story inn resembling a barn, it was frequented by soldiers of the Lord's Men and the Zhentilar , roughnecks who often tracked in mud and sharpened their swords at their tables and filled the air with pipe-smoke. It was little more than a Zhent barracks.</p>
