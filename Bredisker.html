<p>Bredisker was a thief of the 12th century DR .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Majesty, 1177 DR , in the southern Sword Coast lands, Bredisker successfully stole the Tome of Torment , the holiest book of the faith of Ilmater the Crying God. Bredisker fled east to the Thornwood , but was continually harassed and stalked by the Ilmatari. A weary Bredisker soon sold the book to Lalaskra of Ormpetarr , a priestess of Loviatar and an enemy of the church.</p>
