<p>Rogarsheim , sometimes called Norland Town , was the capital city of the Northlander Kingdom of Norland on the island of Norland in the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The city was located on the Bay of Norland along the coast of the Sea of Moonshae near the center of the island. It lay within a sheltered cove and lacked a deep-water harbor.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Rpgarsheim boasted the largest fleet among the dozen small kingdoms of Norland, consisting of six longships each crewed by forty experienced fighters . The fearsome warriors of Rogarsheim were sometimes known as the Stormbanner Wolves .</p>
<p>In the mid–14 th century DR , their forces included a company of horsemen known as the Bloodriders , who were said to be the most elite mounted warriors among the Northlanders.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Most of Rogarsheim's industry was centered around fishing, hunting, and shipbuilding. The city was a major Northlander port for trade with far off Waterdeep and Ruathym . The lack of a traditional harbor meant that large ships had to drop anchor several hundred yards (meters) from the coast and transport goods ashore via boat . Meanwhile, Northlander longships simply sailed to the city's gravel beaches and were pulled up to park above the waterline.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Northlanders of Rogarsheim were famed for their warlike attitude, suspicion toward outsiders, and insular culture. Even so, they could be gracious hosts for esteemed visitors.</p>
<p>King Grunnarch the Red ruled Norland from his lodge in Rogarsheim in the mid–14 th century DR.</p>
<p>Jarl Rault "the Wise" ruled Norland from Stormbanner Hold in Rogarsheim in the late 15 th century DR. The population of Rogarsheim was a mix of Northlanders and Ffolk . There were plenty of dwarves here as well who were eager to mine the north and South Jotunhammer Mountains . It was also not uncommon to see fey creatures from Gwynneth who came to Rogarsheim to trade.</p>
