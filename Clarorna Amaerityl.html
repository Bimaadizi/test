<p>Clarorna Amaerityl , the so-called Wizardess of Athkatla , was a mage for hire based in Amn and often employed by House Selemchant in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>In her old age, Clarorna's body was constantly in aches of aging that defied her life-prolonging magics. The constant pain made her temper shorter than it once was. Nevertheless, she was a woman with a sharp mind who showed kindness to the common folk and demanded the nobility and the wealthy to act with respect and responsibility.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As a wizard, she was a force to be reckoned with. When things turned to violence, Clarorna was well-protected by a chain of contingency spells that released up to six "hanging" spells that were ready to be triggered to teleport her away and dispense magical healing, as well as leaving behind parting gifts of deadly offensive incantations.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Even though Clarorna appeared to be around forty-eight years old, she was much older in realityâ€”more than ninety years old, in fact. As a researcher who studied longevity that did not involve lichdom , she managed to preserve her looks. Still, the age and frailty nevertheless began affecting her body with aches and pains, which affected her temper.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Clarorna Amaerityl maintained a relationship with the Council of Five of Amn that allowed her to voice her opinions bluntly and directly when she thought their policies to be barbaric or lacking foresight.</p>
<p>Clarorna Amaerityl was a close friend of Laeral Silverhand , the Lady Mage and the Open Lord of Waterdeep . However, Alustriel Silverhand and Clarorna shared no love and were politely cool with each other at best. Elminster and Clarorna shared a relationship of jests and jabs, as she often called the Old Mage a useful "loose cannon."</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, Clarorna Amaerityl had made a name for herself by stepping into situations where mercantile resistance turned into violence.</p>
