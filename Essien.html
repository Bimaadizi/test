<p>Essien was a foreman from the Mines of Selgol in the jungle nation of Samarach in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Essien was a rugged man with brown hair and a look of a laborer. Like other inhabitants of Samarach, Essien showed little interest in talking to outlanders.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the salt mines of Selgol were attacked by a tribe of firenewts who came from deeper underground. The creatures dragged workers underground and claimed the excavation as the surviving miners fled. Torich's militia was informed of the attack but failed to act in a timely manner. Essien, one of the mine's foremen, was desperate for help against the fiery monsters. Some said that a group of adventurers who worked with merchant Sa'Sani of Samargol volunteered to help with the situation and eradicate the infestation after meeting the man drinking his sorrows away at The Broken Pick in Torich .</p>
