<p>Druindar's Rock was a rocky outcropping somewhere in Cormanthor , and a favored zone for elves to spell-duel.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The rocky formation rose over the treetops of Cormanthor . The formation was wooded on top, but it had a narrow projection that had no greenery on it. The trees atop the formation included shadowtop .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 241Â DR , Delmuth Echorn lured Elminster Aumar , recently knighted an armathor , to Druindar's Rock for a spell-duel. Galan Goadulphyn and Athtar Nlossae rushed to the mountain during the duel, concerned that Galan's cache would be revealed or buried; a tree nearly fell upon them. Ultimately, fallout from the battle wound up slaying Athtar and causing Galan to fall while climbing.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>To the Srinshee , that was the most likely place for a spellbattle or moot, if a Cormathan challenged another.</p>
