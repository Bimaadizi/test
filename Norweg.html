<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Norweg had a black cat familiar , smoked Saltweed tobacco , and was primarily a wine drinker.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1357 DR , Norweg the Magnificent and Panese the Excitable separately stole two minor magic items of historical importance from the city vaults at approximately the same time. Norweg spilled some of his wine at one of the vaults. Though the thieves were unidentified, suspicions and divinations tracked them to Magician's Row. The City Guard serving Regent of the Exchequer Vernon Condor only had time to search two of the five houses before they earned their boss's ire, so they tried to deduce the culprits from what they knew of the five wizards in the neighborhood.</p>
