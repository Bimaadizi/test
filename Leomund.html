<p>Leomund was an otherworldly mage , who created several famous spells , mostly associated with sheltering.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Leomund originated from Oerth . Because travel between planes was common among higher-level magic users, his spells eventually found their way to Toril . They were considered rare in the sense that apprentices were normally not taught these spells, yet the spells where widely known, at least by their name.</p>
<p>The following spells were attributed to Leomund: Leomund's arena , Leomund's billet , Leomund's hidden lodge , Leomund's lamentable belabourment , Leomund's secret chest , Leomund's secure shelter , Leomund's spacious carriage , Leomund's tiny hut , Leomund's tiny igloo , and Leomund's trap .</p>
