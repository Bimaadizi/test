<p>Durvastra was a cloud giant who met an untimely end in the depths of Wheloon Prison in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the operation of the Wheloon Prison, the ruthless Night Brigade enjoyed a period of ascendancy above the other gangs. One of their officers, Agarta the Breaker , operated a series of arenas where gladiatorial beasts and prisoners were pitted against each other. The most extraordinary of her fighters was the cloud giant Durvastra, who somehow ended up in the prison, where he served as a champion gladiator for some time. This grim winning streak was ended when the Riverside Rats gang sent a team into the prison to fight the Night Brigade, eventually meeting Durvastra in his arena and slaying him and Agarta as well.</p>
