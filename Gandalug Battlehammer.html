<p>Gandalug Battlehammer was a dwarf of Clan Battlehammer and the first and ninth king of Mithral Hall . He was imprisoned by Yvonnel Baenre before he was freed after Yvonnel's death in the Battle of Keeper's Dale .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gandalug was the king of Clan Battlehammer at the time when Bruenor led a thousand dwarves of the clan to Mithral Hall and commenced work on building the Undercity.</p>
<p>As he grew old, he found his closest friend in the battlerager Crommower Pwent , an ancestor of Thibbledorf Pwent , who later became a close friend of the later King Bruenor Battlehammer . Gandalug eventually gave the kingdom to his son and, with the aid of his companion Crommower, descended into the Underdark for a final journey and adventure. They encountered drow elves, led by Yvonnel Baenre, and there they engaged the drow. Crommower was killed by a lance while he was slaying a drow wizard , and Gandalug's soul was stolen by Baenre and sealed within his own tooth.</p>
<p>Baenre tormented him for thousands of years, until the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR when Baenre threw Gandalug's tooth in a fit of rage, freeing his soul. He attempted to kill Baenre with her son Berg'inyon Baenre 's own sword, but was foiled by an illithid ally . During the Battle of Keeper's Dale and the ferocious fighting in the tunnels, he was freed by his descendant Bruenor Battlehammer, the rogue drow Drizzt Do'Urden , Bruenor's adopted daughter Catti-brie , and the halfling Regis . He then took up the throne as the ninth King of Mithral Hall, allowing Bruenor and the Companions of the Hall to seek out adventure again.</p>
<p>Gandalug died not long after his ascension to the throne. With his death, Thibbledorf Pwent and the famed Gutbuster Brigade sought out Bruenor Battlehammer to inform him that he, the eighth King of Mithral Hall, was now the tenth King of Mithral Hall.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Gandalug had three sons; the youngest, Bruenor Battlehammer I , became the second King of Mithral Hall. He chose him as he was the most fitting. The more well-known Bruenor Battlehammer was Gandalug's great-great-great-great grandson.</p>
