<p>The Helm at Highsun was a tavern in the town of Red Larch owned by a mage named Yather Indaglol around 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The tavern was shadowy and quiet. Most customers were caravan guards, adventurers, retired people, merchants looking for relaxation, and people who just wanted to be alone.</p>
<h2>Staff</h2>
<p>The motto of the Helm at Highsun was enforced by a silent, attentive, and menacing helmed horror that was under the mental control of Indaglol. The horror was known as Araldyk , and served as waiter, usher, bouncer, and sometimes a cloak rack.</p>
