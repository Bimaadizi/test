<p>Cap'n Gyudd , who went by no other name, was a former adventurer and a shopkeeper in the city of Bral in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cap'n Gyudd was a lean and strong dwarf , but in his later years, he walked with a limp on a polished ivory peg-leg—although he claimed that it was carved from the "eye-tooth" of a radiant dragon .</p>
<p>In his retired years, Cap'n Gyudd weighed 157 pounds (71.2 kilograms) and stood 47 inches (120 centimeters) tall.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Cap'n owned a shop on the leading edge of the Rock of Bral called, fittingly, Cap'n Gyudd's . Located on the border of the Dwarven District , it was a very popular store and sold all manner of mundane spacefaring gear at reasonable prices. It was such a popular store that tour guides often brought people there.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Cap'n Gyudd loved beer ; it was his first love and was stronger than his love for women. He also smoked a great deal of tobacco, such that his store reeked of it.</p>
<p>The Cap'n also enjoyed sharing stories and legends with customers, and his shop attracted many—as he called them—"breakfast table commandos", who wished they could travel into wildspace but never had the courage to do so. (He happily sold such folk "space souvenirs" and small nautical trinkets.)</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Cap'n Gyudd owned a magical throwing warhammer , a suit of magical chainmail , and a ring of protection and a ring of protection against charm .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Cap'n Gyudd was good friends with Gamalon Idogyr , and the two once adventured together. While both men were retired in Bral, they sent potential customers to each other's stores.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Cap'n Gyudd was once enslaved as "cattle" by a group of illithids . The Cap'n managed to escape and also rescued nearly three dozen other hapless souls.</p>
<p>He is most famous for the manner in which he lost his leg. In a wildspace battle, he voluntarily placed himself into a heavy catapult and launched himself onto an enemy spelljammer . Part of his foot got caught in the ship's rigging and was ripped off. His body tumbled to the deck, and he was knocked unconscious and almost bled to death. His crew performed an amputation and cauterized the wound to stop the bleeding, and their next stop was the Rock of Bral. Cap'n Gyudd retired from adventuring that day.</p>
