<p>Slavin'krath'magaal , also known as Slavin , was a young brown dragon living in Unther .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Slavin was a young brown dragon, part of a dragon generation that had dealings with Tiamat , who agreed to collaborate with the Tiamatian cleric Malise in exchange for rituals to boost her power; these rituals gave her the fiendish archetype. She eventually agreed to mate with Malise and brought forth a half-dragon offspring, Braeden .</p>
<p>Later in life, her offspring Braeden had a vision of something monstrous emerging from the Pit of Many Colors , which was dismissed by Malise. Feeling that he had lost touch with the will of Tiamat, Slavin and Braeden began plotting together to overthrow him. In 1374 DR , Slavin was killed by an adventurers' band raiding the underground Temple of Tiamat.</p>
