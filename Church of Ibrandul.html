<p>The church of Ibrandul ( pronounced : /ˈ ɪ ˈ b r ɑː n d ə l / Ih-BRAN-duhl ) was the primary religious organization dedicated to the worship and service of the deity Ibrandul .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The clergy of Ibrandul included clerics, specialty priests called darkwalkers , and gray druids .</p>
<p>Novices were called "Children of Ibrandul". Full priests were called Lurker, until they underwent the elah'ranak ceremony, after which they were addressed as "Mysterious Lurker". A leader of a temple was an "Impenetrable Lurker". It was not unknown for individual priests to take distinct titles for themselves, and only recognition of the title by the local Impenetrable Lurker was needed to make it official.</p>

<h2>Rituals</h2>
<p>Elah'ranak , or "Protective Armor of Darkness" in Alzhedo , was a ritual all priests of Ibrandul undertook.</p>
<h2>Celebrations</h2>
<p>The Ibrandulin celebrated only a few holy days. One, when on a new moon when the sky was covered by clouds, the priests would emerge into the Land Above to celebrate a ritual called the Foreshadowing, which started at midnight and ended before dawn.</p>
<p>They also celebrated the "Deliverance Unto Darkness" each Midwinter's Eve, giving thanks for the long-along liberation of the first members from the drow. This celebration typically involved sacrificing a monstrous spider or some other creature or being closely associated with Lolth . Then, long chains of Ibrandulin would cast dark path and wander through the Underdark without light, trusting in their deity to guide them to safety.</p>
