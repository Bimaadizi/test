<p>Halrath was a rare and precious magical fruit native to the Malatran Plateau in Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Halrath fruits, or more precise, berries, were edible but terribly bitter. There existed two varieties: green and red fruits. When the green fruit was consumed, it allowed for conversing with the animal life of the Living Jungle as if under the effects of the speak with animals spell for five minutes. Red fruits did the same but as through the speak with plants spell.</p>
<p>Once the fruit was harvested, it lasted for only about two nights. After that, the fruit dried out and lost its magic.</p>
