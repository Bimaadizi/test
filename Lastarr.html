<p>Lastarr was an independent trading city found in the Shining Lands . While it was formerly a part of the nation of Estagund , it remained in the territory of the Durpari kingdom from the 11 th to the mid–14 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was a truly inclusive city that allowed beings of any background within its walls to conduct trade. Often-maligned creatures such as vampires or even beholders , even those from Veldorn , could freely enter Lastarr to carry on with their business.</p>
<p>The fact that Lastarr's doors were open to anyone extended only so far that these individuals did not interfere with the business of others.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Lastarr was situated along the lengthy road that passed westward through Durpar, right on the border of Veldorn.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>It was considered poor form to inquire into the origins of goods purchased in Lastarr, a fact that often allowed merchants to sell imported items for considerable markup.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The city was well-defended by 20-man patrols most of which included a powerful spellcaster and cleric of Lucha , She Who Guides.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the great Jeradeem Seltarir acquired the nation of Estagund for the Durpari throne in the Year of Crimson Magics, 1026 DR , Lastarr refused to align itself with the ever-expanding kingdom.</p>
