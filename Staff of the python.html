<p>A staff of the python was a magical staff that could transform into a snake under its wielder's mental command.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A typical staff of the python measured 4 feet (1.2 meters) in length and weighed around 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms). It could be used as a magical quarterstaff .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The staff accepted a command word that transformed it into a giant constrictor snake . Speaking the same command word again reverted the snake back into staff form. An injured snake returned to full health once restored to the staff.</p>
<p>The snake accepted telepathic commands from the staff's wielder. If the snake was killed before it had a chance to be reverted to staff form, it did so, after which the staff was destroyed. However, some variants of the staff were not destroyed, but the snake could not be summoned for three days.</p>
<h2>Notable Staves of the Python</h2>
