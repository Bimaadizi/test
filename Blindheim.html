<p>Blindheim were frog -like humanoids that inhabited the Underdark , where their ability to project beams of light from their huge eyes made them a unique light source in the dark realm. Most blindheim had only animalistic intelligence and dwelled alone or in small groups, but around 10% of the population were more advanced and lived in settlements, most of which worshiped the slaadi .</p>
<p>Fascinated by the surface, the intelligent blindheims believed their ancestors had stolen a piece of the sun and still feared its retribution. They would offer their services to surface dwellers they considered too strong to ambush, asking payment of fresh food, metal weapons, or surface trinkets in return.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Blindheim were bipedal frog-like humanoids that possessed a pair of huge eyes capable of emitting blinding beams of light at will. These beams were blocked by an extra eyelid while a blindheim was resting, but could be instantly emitted when the creature opened its eyes. The beam was equivalent in strength to natural light, although if focused it could char flesh and bone. The beams ceased upon a blindheim's death, after which their eyes appeared a dull gold in color. Other features of a blindheim's head included a mouth full of needle-like teeth and fang incisors, a long tongue, and two flat nostrils. They possessed an acute sense of hearing that allowed them to identify the direction of those around them even when their eyes were shut. Their hands had four digits with hooked talons including a thumb and their webbed feet had three clawed toes.</p>
<p>Blindheims were generally varying shades of yellow in color, with darker shades on their back and lighter shades on their underbelly. Colored variants with additional abilities also existed, with amber blindheim whose eyes were hypnotic , blue blindheim whose eye beams afflicted targets with faerie fire , gold blindheim who could emit small fireballs from their mouths, and white blindheim who could discharge sunbeams from their eyes periodically.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Amphibious by nature, blindheim could move equally well on land or in water and thrived in damp subterranean settings, dwelling near pools, lakes, or other underground water bodies. They were capable of eating all but the most toxic types of fungi and mosses and supplementrf their omnivorous diet with other underground creatures such as jermlaine , whose numbers they were highly effective at keeping low.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>The majority of blindheims had an animalistic level of intelligence. They were not known to use tools and communicated among themselves through guttural croaking, although it was unknown if this was a true language. When attacking, they used their eye beams or bit their targets if at close enough range, swallowing those that were tiny enough whole.</p>
<p>Generally solitary, they could be encountered in small groups of up to four individuals, but would sometimes gather in large groups of tens or even hundreds of individuals and then move through an area as a ravening horde. These large groups would attack and devour all in their path before suddenly quietly dispersing back to their individual territories.</p>
<p>Around 10% of the blindheim population were part of more advanced tribes, living in crudely constructed villages of between 30 and 120 members that spoke with rudimentary, halting, croaking Undercommon and used tools. Otherwise generally similar to their less advanced cousins, the advanced blindheim groups were protected by barbed dart -wielding warriors , with leaders from one of the blindheim color variants. The largest tribes also had shamans or witch doctors and in general the advanced blindheim worshiped the slaadi .</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>According to blindheim tales, their ancient ancestors lived on the surface until they stole a piece of the sun and fled to the Underdark , where they consumed it in order to gain the ability to project light from their eyes. As such, blindheim feared that the sun would one day venture down into the Underdark and take revenge on them.</p>
<p>Despite this, blindheim were fascinated by tales and objects from the surface, especially plants or other pieces of nature. Usually dwelling on the fringes of the Underdark, they would gather near routes used by merchants and other travelers from the surface in order to try and obtain fresh food, metal weapons, or surface trinkets.</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>Opportunistic ambushers, blindheim would attack those they encountered if they felt they had sufficiently superior numbers or greater strength, taking what they desired. However, if those they encountered were deemed superior in strength, the blindheim would approach cautiously and offer their services in exchange for payment of what they sought. When interacting with surface dwellers, blindheim would insist that no one inform the sun of their existence and would endlessly ask questions about the sun's actions, anger, and attitudes. Believing that the sun could not possibly have forgotten their ancestors' heroic theft and that they were infamous and feared by all on the surface, blindheim became angry and offended should any surface dweller attempt to soothe their fears about the sun's wrath.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>Blindheim represented a unique source of light in the Underdark and, although they were very rarely encountered, they proved particularly troublesome to those adverse to bright light, such as goblins and drow . Despite the risk and hindrance that blindheim's eye beams posed to them, other denizens of the Underdark—drow and kuo-toain particular—would raid blindheim settlements to enslave them for use as living weapons. The sorcerer Mordenkainen always brought a holy symbol of the sun god Pelor with him when visiting the Underdark in order to impersonate a vengeful priest should he encounter any blindheims.</p>
