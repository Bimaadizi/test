<p>The White Tree was a 30‑foot-tall (9.1‑meter) white tree with golden leaves growing in Bloodstone Village in Damara . It grew from the Tree-Gem of Bloodstone .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , Gareth Dragonsbane and his companions traveled to the Abyss and stole the Wand of Orcus using advice from Saint Sollars . The Platinum dragon Bahamut then directed them to the only method of its destruction, which was to immerse the wand in the black blood of the heart of an avatar of Tiamat .</p>
<p>After they destroyed the wand, its heart was left behind in the form of a small white gem. Bahamut gave it to Gareth as a sign of his covenant with him to protect Damara from demon attacks. The gem was planted in the courtyard of Palace Dragonsbane in Bloodstone Village and grew into a tall white tree with golden leaves.</p>
<p>The Tree-Gem brought renewed interest from non-dragons in the worship of Bahamut as a god.</p>
<p>By 1480 DR , a decade after Vaasa and the Warlock Knights conquered Bloodstone Pass , the tree still stood outside the ruins of Bloodstone Village, but it had become petrified and lifeless.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>So long as the rulers of Bloodstone aligned with good, the Tree-Gem prevented demons from entering the Kingdom of Bloodstone.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the White Tree dropped a branch that could be fashioned into powerful weapons or magical items for those deemed worthy. Grandmaster Kane carried a jo stick made from such a branch. The wooden doors to King Gareth's audience chamber and the desk of the wizard Emelyn the Gray were also made of the same wood.</p>
