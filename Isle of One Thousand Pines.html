<p>The Isle of One Thousand Pines was one of the Outer Isles of Wa in Kara-Tur . It was considered part of Jasuga Province . It was a densely forested placeâ€”hence, its name.</p>
<p>The island was the site of a prison colony for Wa, until the prisoners were relocated to Ibhei , a larger island. The prison was abandoned and left to fall to ruins.</p>
<p>Kazuo Tokuri was the last prisoner to be held on the Isle. He was nephew to the former shogun, Matasuuri Shogoro , and had been framed for planning a coup. He died there, and his spirit was said to still linger in the ruins of the prison by 1357 DR .</p>
