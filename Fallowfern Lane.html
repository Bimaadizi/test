<p>Fallowfern Lane was an angled southbound street in the walled town of Mosstone that stood along the Trade Way in Tethyr .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Sairnor Street merged with the southern end of the Fallowfern Lane at a steep angle, forming the distinct address where Taluth's Shrewd Flight , an archery store, could be found. Another location of some note that stood on the crossing of the two streets was a forgettable hot-bun shop.</p>
