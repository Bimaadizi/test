<p>Necromentals were undead remnants of elementals .</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Necromentals were warped and evil, retaining only a fraction of the awareness and intelligence they had in life.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Necromentals retained much of the abilities they had while alive, but gained some as undead: they "healed" quickly as long as they were by some form of their element, they could drain the energy of creatures they attacked, and any elementals they slew in that manner would rise as necromentals 1-4 days after death.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Necromentals usually inhabited the same environment as they had in life.</p>
