<p>The turis was a variety of tree that grew in the mountains of Cormyr in central Faer√ªn . They were most commonly found above the timberline in both the Storm Horns and Thunder Peak Mountains .</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Beneath the tough bark of the turis was a sap that was used in the creation of a restorative salve. When properly applied to less-severe wounds, it would heal them without leaving a scar. It would have no effect when applied to injuries caused by magical weapons .</p>
