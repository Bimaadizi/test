<p>A hexblade was an arcane spellcaster who combined magical power with martial skill. A hexblade's power could manifest itself spontaneously, similarly to a sorcerer 's magic, or be granted via a warlock pact.</p>

<h2>Abilities</h2>
<h3>General Skills</h3>
<p>Hexblade warlocks trained even more thoroughly in the martial arts than other warlocks, mastering use of a broader variety of weapons and the ability to effectively fight in heavier armor. They were also able to closely attune themselves to a weapon; instead of needing great strength or dexterity to effectively wield a weapon it would become an extension of their charismatic will, the same source of strength for their spells, making them exceptionally deadly fighters.</p>
<h3>Hexblade Spells</h3>
<p>If a bargain was made between a warlock and a being from the Shadowfell , the warlock's patron gave them access to certain powers, including a suite of spells that expanded the choices to fill their spell slots.</p>
<p>One of the benefits hexblades received from their patron was access to more spells from which to choose, beginning with the defensive shield and the offensive wrathful smite . After some advancement, the hexblade could choose to blur themselves with shadows or use branding smite to reveal an opponent hiding in shadow. Next, a hexblade warlock could use the blink spell to confound their enemies or charge their weapon with an elemental force for a time. At the next level of advancement they could learn to play mind tricks with phantasmal killer or staggering smite . And finally, when sufficiently advanced, a hexblade could infuse a weapon with enough power to blast a creature off the plane for a time or chill them to the bone with cone of cold .</p>
