<p>A hand of Kiaransalee's glory was an item with properties similar to a hand of glory except it had five silver rings upon it that each produced a different magical power.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Each hand of Kiaransalee's glory was a mummified drow hand that wore a silver ring on each finger.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Each of the silver rings upon a hand of Kiaransalee's glory could manifest a different magical power at the command of the wearer up to once per day each. The powers manifested were deeper darkness , see invisibility , ray of enfeeblement , chill touch , and spectral hand . However, if any of the rings were removed from the hand, they would be rendered non-magical until returned to the hand.</p>
<p>Additionally, if one of the silver rings was replaced with a magic ring then the wearer could gain the benefits of the magic ring just as if she wore it on her own finger; this property worked just like a hand of glory . If this exchange was performed, then the power of that specific silver ring was unavailable until the silver ring was returned.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1372 DR , the cult of Kiaransalee made use of this item during the Silence of Lolth .</p>
