<p>The Naug-orls (meaning "devil worms"), or simply the Worms , were Zhentil Keep 's thieves' guild around 1358 DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Worms were led by someone called the "Night Fingers". Shounra Shalassalar was the Night Fingers of the Worms by around 1358 DR . All 600 members of the Worms reported to her through a secretive hierarchy.</p>
<p>In truth, however, the Night Fingers reported all the information collected to certain members of Zhentil Keep's Council of Lords . However, Shounra's real master was Manshoon . However, the ties between criminal and official interests in Zhentil Keep were so strong that they usually acted more like a scout's company than thieves.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Feared and shunned by the Zhents , the Worms secretly frequented all taverns and inns within the city, spying for their master. The Worms would kidnap, frame, arrest, or commit murder in service to their master.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The naug-orls operated out of the Thieves' Guildhall within the Inner Quarter of Zhentil Keep.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Naug-orls were seriously decimated in the 1368 DR invasion by Cyric 's monstrous army and ceased to exist as organized force, although Shoundra tried to regroup her followers again.</p>
