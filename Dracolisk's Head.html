<p>The Dracolisk's Head was an inn in the city of Calaunt in the Vast , operating around 1358 DR .</p>
<p>It was a low-quality and dilapidated place, but cheap. Despite this, it had a stuck-up air of tired old glories. There were quite a number of side-entrances and sewer-access ways that allowed for quick, hidden escapes.</p>
