<p>The Rapids was the only inn left standing in Teshwave around 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Rapids was run by four citizens of Teshwaveâ€” Hallorfan Teshdale , Tula Woodsbridge , Doryn , and Calla Ayetes . In reality they were little more than indentured servants forced to cook, clean, and brew ale by the Zhentilar troops stationed in the town.</p>
