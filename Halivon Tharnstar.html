<p>Halivon Tharnstar , also known as Avowed of Mystra , was the author of the Tales Told to a Blind Wizard , penned in 1363 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point before the Year of the Wyvern, 1363 DR , Halivon met a "crazed" man who claimed to have found the fabled One True Spell . The Avowed of Mystra noted that the man was not "crazed" at all; instead, the stranger appeared content, freed from urges and vices. Spells did not affect the man, and he could weave enchantments with a mere thought. When asked about the One True Spell , the "crazed" man informed Halivon that it was a woman named Mystra.</p>
<p>This enchanted was detailed in Halivon Tharnstar's book â€“ the Tales Told to a Blind Wizard , published sometime before 1363 DR. By the late-14 th century DR, a copy of the Tales was kept in the massive library of Candlekeep on the Sword Coast North .</p>
