<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tomes of clear thought were heavy books that contained exercises designed to improve the reader's memory and logical thinking. Contents of these tomes varied. Some contained a selection of esoteric and studious works of literature. Some works involved obscure mathematical or algebraic formulae, or even books that contained information on inter-planar biology.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Charged within the book's words was a powerful magical enchantment. If the reader completed the book within a period of 6 days, an activity that required a total of 48 hours of reading, the reader was endowed with a substantial improvement to mental capacities, including the ability to further extend them beyond natural capabilities.</p>
