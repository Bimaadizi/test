<p>Wind walkers , or maswat-rih , were rare creatures native to the Elemental Plane of Air where they served the djinn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These creatures appeared like a mass of constantly writhing serpents. They were barely visible unless viewed while within a sandstorm. A distinct whistling or roaring sound preceded the approach of a group of wind walkers.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Wind walkers greatly enjoyed potent aromas and this could be used to lure them into traps.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Wind walkers could use telepathy to hear any thought within 100 yards (91 m). A group of wind walkers working together could use this ability up to 300 yards (270 meters).</p>
<p>The primary attack of a wind walker was a blast of forceful air. Any gas based attack used against them could be dispersed quickly, causing minimal damage.</p>
<p>All sounds of battle with a wind walker were muffled by the sound of roaring wind. Thus, orders from superior officers were nearly useless when facing wind walkers.</p>
<p>As partially ethereal creatures, wind walkers could only be attacked by other ethereal creatures such as djinn, invisible stalkers , or ghosts . Magical weapons were needed to physically strike a wind walker.</p>
<p>Wind walkers were immune to all forms of magical attack with the exception of any weather-related spell.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Wind walkers survived on water vapor and tiny specks of dust or other airborne particles.</p>
<h3>Homelands</h3>
<p>Outside of the Elemental Plane of Air, wind walkers could sometimes be found on the Prime Material plane . In the land of Zakhara , wind walkers could be found high in the mountains or in caves located deep underground. In the land of Kara-Tur , one to ten of them was always in the company of the dragon lords of spring, summer, fall, and winter.</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>Wind walkers possessed their own language, known properly as Wahaauri.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>The djinn kept these creatures as cloud sculptors. They were also used to herd rain clouds.</p>
<p>In Zakhara, Al-Badia were careful not to offend the wind walkers because of their ability to bring, or prevent, rain clouds from coming to an area.</p>
<p>Sometimes wind walkers were forced to serve storm giants , cloud giants , and other powerful creatures found in the mountains.</p>
<p>They maintained good relations with the yak folk found on the planes . Wind walkers could also be found in Uroboros , the divine realm of the couatl deity Jazirian . And they acted as servants of the deity Aerdrie Faenya .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1358 DR , in the month of Alturiak , there were reports that wizards in Zhentil Keep had devised a way to summon and control wind walkers.</p>
