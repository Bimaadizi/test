<p>Mesku Peak was a mountain in the Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains of southern Tabot .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Shou Year 710 (−540 DR) , seven lamas of the Zotung Keep discovered a man frozen in ice on Mesku Peak. They recovered the man and defrosted him, but he melted away with the ice and in his place they found a male leopard cub. They raised the leopard and it grew as big as a horse . Finally, one day it even talked, and asked to be allowed to go free. Surprised, the lamas opened the gates to the leopard, which returned to Mesku Peak. Afterward, the new abbot of the new Zotung Gompa called on the leopard for help when making decisions, and since then, it was said to visit many lamas in dreams to dispense advice on the proper way to achieve enlightenment. The whole affair was declared a miracle, the first of the young nation of Tabot.</p>
<p>A hot spring, claimed to have magical powers, was discovered in the mountains northeast of Mesku Peak in Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) .</p>
