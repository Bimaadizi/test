<p>War Chief Hartusk was an orc warlord in the Kingdom of Many-Arrows in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hartusk was always a warmonger among the Many-Arrows orcs so it was easy for the drow under Tiago Baenre to manipulate him into ousting the moderate Obould dynasty in the Year of the Awakened Sleepers, 1484 DR and starting a new war against the Silver Marches .</p>
<p>In the closing stages of the War of the Silver Marches , Hartusk was killed by Bruenor Battlehammer .</p>
