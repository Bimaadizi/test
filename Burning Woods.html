<p>The Burning Woods were a forest in the Shadowfell and a reflection of the Neverwinter Woods , a forest on the Prime Material world of Toril .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The woods stood not far beyond the eastern walls of the city of Evernight . The Shadowfell Road that began in the city traveled through this forest, beginning in a desolate stretch of wasteland with calf-deep mounds of gray ash and faintly glowing embers. Once it reached the woods proper it became narrow forest paths, twisting and turning between the trees, where those who traveled without care could go miles in the wrong direction or end up where they began.</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>Portions of this forest were swathed in extreme heat, pervasive smoke, or both due to the active volcano that stood within it. On occasion gouts of fire, lava, or small stones could be found raining from the sky due to it.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>The trees that filled this forest were blackened and glowing, in a perpetual state of burning ever since they were saplings. Some of these trees—known as ash trees —seemed sentient and quite angry, known to lash out at those who came near them.</p>
<p>Burrowing undead could occasionally be found living within the heavy ash mounds of the forest, such as carcass eaters and corpse vampires . Bandits and other predators could be found lurking near its twisted forest paths, as they were the only truly usable roads.</p>
