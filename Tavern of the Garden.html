<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Tavern of the Garden was run by Charles Morden , a successful gardener who offered his master services to the nobility of Ravens Bluff. When Charles died at the age of eighty-three, circa the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , soon after The Three Women War ended, his daughter, Shauna Morden , inherited Charles's small estate that included the Tavern of the Garden, a small vinery outside Ravens Bluff and another vinery in a valley outside the Dragon Falls . Shauna promptly took over the business and aimed to be a success. She renovated the Tavern of the Garden and hosted a grand re-opening evening of free food and drinks in hopes of securing Ravenaar patronage.</p>
<p>During the re-opening, Shauna Morden personally greeted arriving guests and individuals in line for admission, playing the role of a hostess. During the event, Shauna gathered a group of adventurers of the Living City and offered them a lucrative job â€“ to investigate the family vinery outside Dragon Falls. Unlike other parts of the business, Shauna did not know of the vinery's existence and wanted to have it running, producing wine for the eatery, or getting in contact with its current managers, whom she did not know. Subsequently, the adventurers discovered its master vintner maedar Vorlon , who had claimed the vinery a decade prior. It was believed that the heroes negotiated Shauna and maedar's cooperation and profitable future together, one way or another.</p>
