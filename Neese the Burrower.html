<h2>History</h2>
<p>Neese lived in Wheloon Prison with her fellow wererat gang. They were forced from their hideout by the Night Brigade under Storna Harnwood , who turned it into a Temple of Shar . After being driven to the exterior of the prison where the Purple Dragons made their base, Neese helped organize a counterattack with the surviving Rats, specifically targeting the enemy officer Karissa the Knife , who made a habit of dwelling underground and hoarding treasure. Thanks to Neese, Karissa's hideout in the Wheloon sewers was found and the greedy Master Thief killed.</p>
