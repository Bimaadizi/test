<p>Misker's Warehouse was a warehouse on Heralds' Meet in the Lower Port of Skullport in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The warehouse was a two-story structure in poor condition.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The warehouse was notable for its lack of visible security measures. Despite this, the warehouse remained untouched by thieves or the overly curious. Its security relied entirely on the formidable reputation of its owner, Misker , known as the Pirate Tyrantâ€”a beholder feared throughout Skullport. Although Misker rarely visited his warehouse in person, the fear inspired by his name and his numerous loyal minions effectively protected the property without the need for overt security.</p>
<p>This particular warehouse stored a range of legitimate goods, all part of Misker's complex trading operations. The only protective mechanism within the building was a large pit trap , carefully cultivated by Misker over decades, filled with a layer of deadly green slime . This trap served as a final deterrent to any intruders bold enough to venture inside.</p>
