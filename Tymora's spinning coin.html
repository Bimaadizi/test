<p>Tymora's spinning coin was an artifact coin of divine nature granted to adventurers by The Smiling Lady of Good Fortune, goddess Tymora herself.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These coins were polished and sparkling with gold gleam, believed to had been touched by Tymora. When these coins were placed in a palm, they constantly spun on the rim.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Tymora's spinning coin could be used in battle. When it was activated, the will of the goddess herself descended onto the battlefield, creating a coin that spun around and knocked the enemies around the wielder prone. Then, the power of fortune determined what happened: either the wielder and their allies received a boon of increased offensive power, or the enemies were weakened and cursed .</p>
