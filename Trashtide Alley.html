<p>Trashtide Alley was an alley located in Skullport .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Trashtide Alley was one of the few alleyways in Skullport with a name. It was notorious for the large numbers of both giant and normal rats that gathered to feed on the refuse from nearby establishments such as the Burning Troll tavern, Findlewulf's Galley , and the Drowning Buoy . The scavenging rats were largely fearless, paying little attention to those who passed through the alley. However, it was widely believed that a family of wererats has established residence in the vicinity, driving off or infecting intruders who ventured too close.</p>
