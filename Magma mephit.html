<p>A magma mephit , or a lava mephit , was a mephit composed of earth and fire . They emitted a red glow and were slow to understand other creatures.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They consistently ooze molten lava from their bodies, as if it were perspiration. The heat from their bodies could be sensed from 30 feet (9.1 meters).</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>They were the least intelligent of all mephits, being slow-minded and the brunt of fire mephit jokes.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>They attacked using their claws and a breath weapon. Their breath weapon consisted of a molten blob of lava, which hit a single designated target. If they were encountered in a volcanic region, they regenerated health every few seconds. The touch of a lava mephit automatically dissolved materials such as wood at a slow pace, but melted metal is a matter of seconds, such as plate mail .</p>
<p>They had the ability to shapechange into a pool of molten lava, and even gate in other mephits of a random type. If they came into contact with large quantities of water, they would harden and move half as fast. This had a downside for those using this tactic: the contact of the water with the mephit would release a large amount of sulfurous steam, poisoning and nauseating the opponents.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>For the few urdunnir who employed arcane magic , magma mephits were sometimes employed as familiars .</p>
<p>Magma mephits could be created from the corpses of grease mephits ensorcelled with the invigorating flame spell .</p>
