<p>The Breath of Winter was a mysterious, icy creature that hunted across Damara as of the late 15 th century DR . Its true nature was unknown and hotly debated among local Damarans .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The monster was known to steal the heat from its prey, leaving only frozen husks to be discovered much later. Many believed that the monster's breath neutralized all heat.</p>
<p>It hunted both lone individuals and groups of creatures.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The monster appeared sometime after the melting of the Great Glacier began to reveal passages to the Frostfell , which was said to be infested with monsters previously unknown to Damara. By the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , folk were discovering the remains of victims that appeared to have been slain by the monster many years prior.</p>
<p>Local tales that attempted to identify the monster ranged from a white dragon to undead —perhaps chillborn zombies emerging from nearby Vaalathrim —to a living blizzard to a giant carved from ice and clad in crystalline armor .</p>
