<p>Barach Hilthone was a servant of Gond during the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1356 DR , Barach and his companions from Tilver's Gap were traveling south of Daggerdale when they were attacked by a band of orcs . They fled into the nearby mountains and took refuge within an abandoned mountain fortress. They discovered a cache of treasure inside, including a glowing, magical sword but were chased out by an "eye-covered monster" . When the group returned to Tilverton , a few members of the fighting band went missing and Barach refused to surrender the sword to the Temple of Gond Wondermaker , claiming it as his own loot.</p>
