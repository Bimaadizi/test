<p>Ri'ola'con was the 22nd eadar of the nation of As'arem beneath the Sea of Fallen Stars , and a member of the Nantarn Council .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He had grey skin, but with a white mark on his forehead and white stripes on his dorsal fin, which marked him as a member of the shalarin Rulers' caste .</p>
<p>Ri'ola'con was old and sickly as of the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , at which time he was 241 years old and had been in power for 125 years. He was gaunt and frail, with deep wrinkles and a drooping dorsal fin.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Despite his great age and poor health, his mind remained sharp and clear. He was cognizant of the limits of his own authority, and quite easily saw through the games that politically-minded shalarin played. On the Nantarn Council, he acted as a mediator and facilitator.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Ri'ola'con was the unseen ceremonial emperor of the four shalarin kingdoms which comprised As'arem, as well as the shalarin representative on the Council. He was not the leader of the council, but as the ruler of As'arem, he was the highest-ranking leader.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The decision to tie As'arem close to the Nantarn Council was unpopular among the four kings of the shalarin with whom Ri'ola'con shared his power. This led some to plot against him.</p>
<p>Following the death of his heir, Ri'ola'sur , during the Twelfth Serôs War , Ri'ola'con declared Ri'ola'kirk to be his new heir.</p>
<p>To the surprise of many, especially shalarin, Ri'ola'con forged a friendship with Gayar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ri'ola'con became eadar in the Year of Pain, 1245 DR .</p>
<p>After the Twelfth Serôs War in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , he decided to reside in Myth Nantar, causing tumult and plotting. He however wanted to fully support the Nantarn Alliance .</p>
<p>Ri'ola'con was poisoned on Greengrass of 1370 DR while in his palace at Us'roch .</p>
