<p>The Beastlord Harshom was a wizard from the Host Tower of the Arcane in Luskan , allied with the Legion of the Chimera in the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Harshom was a human mage with fair skin tone and gray hair. He wore gray robes and was armed with a greatsword .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Harshom's title came from the use of war- bears for his nefarious deeds. His magically-trained beasts were fierce opponents who could dispatch well-armored knights with ease. The Beastlord's war-bears wore enchanted colors that bound the animals to his and his will alone, making them impervious to charm spells and animal handling skills. At one point, Harshom considered having battle-cats but decided against it as the name was less intimidating than war-bears.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , the Host Tower of the Arcane found itself secretly allied with the Legion of the Chimera, a horde of monstrous humanoids and half-breeds who treated to wipe the settlements of Icewind Dale off the map . One of the Arcane Brotherhood's mages – Phaen of the Rags was instrumental in the Legion's infiltration of Targos that almost resulted in the town's conquest if not for the intervention of a band of mercenaries from Luskan hired by Targos.</p>
<p>The adventurers embarked on the journey to stop the Legion – the journey that took them across the Frozenfar and the Spine of the World . As retaliation, the Host Tower of the Arcane sent The Beastlord Harshom to track the heroes down across the frozen landscape and end their quest. Harshom, his four war-bears, two female wizards, and four ranger -trackers pursued the group past the Ice Lakes and the Fell Wood . By luck, Harshom came across a couple from the Wandering Village – Leevi‎ and Carita‎ , a pair of murders exposed by the adventures who were more than happy to point to where the adventurers were heading. As payment for their help, Harshom fed the couple to his war-bears.</p>
<p>Harshom set an ambush for the adventurers but, presumably, was slain in the battle that followed.</p>
