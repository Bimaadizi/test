<h2>Personality</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Someone with a grudge against Draung hired a pirate named Endreth Molipher to kidnap the wizard, cut off his hands, cut out his tongue, blind him, and deliver him to a galley in Westgate where he would be forced to serve the rowing slaves. Onsible put up a good fight and his monstrous guards almost killed Molipher, but the wizard ultimately lost the battle. Molipher tortured Draung and learned about the deepspawn, which gave him a career-changing idea. After delivering Onsible to Westgate, Molipher returned to Saerloon and acquired the deepspawn with the help of some lesser wizards that were squabbling over the remains of Onsible's estate.</p>
