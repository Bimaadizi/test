<p>A staff sling , also known as a fustibalus , was a staff that had a pocketed thong attached to its tip. They were available in many places across Faerûn , even in the Underdark .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Staff slings were large ranged weapons, about 5 feet (1.5 meters) in length, used to launch bullets or heavy stones. They were incredibly slow to use, and somewhat like "miniature siege engines ". As a result, it was fairly difficult to aim with them, but when their projectile struck a target, it did far more damage than a normal sling .</p>
