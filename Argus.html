<p>Argus was a powerful fighter from Deepingdale in the late 14 th century DR who died while on an expedition in the Shining Sea .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Argus worked in Deepingdale as an inexperienced lumberman until meeting the charismatic Waukeenar known as Devlin , who recruited him into his company of eccentric entertainers, entrepreneurs, and scientists that were sailing across the Realms. Devlin made him the captain of one of the group's ships, the Erine's Smile . Eventually the group discovered an island in the Shining Sea, south of Calimshan , which they dubbed the " Forgotten Island ". Sometime around the month of Flamerule , in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Devlin led them all on a colonizing expedition to the island with aims of creating a tourist attraction on the isle that would attract people from all across the Realms. Three months later, things began to go awry for the expedition.</p>
<p>On Marpenoth 5 , Argus and a Chultan by the name of Wedonai were patrolling the island when they came across the horrifically mutilated corpse of a stegosaurus . Wedonai would go on to express concerns about angered forest spirits , whilst Angus would tell Devlin that the creature's wounds were suggestive of an attack from another dinosaur . On Marpenoth 11 , five velociraptors attacked the expedition site's messhall and both men aided in fending them off, though Argus would die in the process. Later that same day Argus's body was buried near the campsite beneath a copse of tropical fruit trees, with a large stone obelisk bearing his name carved into it erected as a burial marker. The expedition's leader Devlin would go on to lament the loss of Argus within the pages of his diary.</p>
