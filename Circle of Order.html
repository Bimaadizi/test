<p>The Circle of Order was a small group of rulers in the Utter East dedicated to law .</p>
<h2>Membership</h2>
<p>The Circle comprised the Lord of Lands , who ruled the Realm of Lands ; the Lord of Flame , who ruled the Realm of Fire ; the Lady of Tides , who ruled the Realm of Tides ; and one other, who would become known as Tartyron . They were known as the lords of order, but Tartyron would become the lord of chaos . Both the Lord of Flame and the Lady of Tides could be revealed in defeat to be undead -like beings, suggesting they had great longevity, even to be undying or undead. [ speculation ]</p>
<h2>Attitudes</h2>
<p>The Circle of Order believed in the progress of order. They were righteous defenders of order within their realms.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In ancient times, the lords of the Circle of Order arose to govern the early nations of the Utter East, those east of the Great Sea . However, one engaged in chaotic plots in the belief that chaos brought challenge, change, and strength, and so was exiled and cast down, bound in a subterranean kingdom, with the Lord of Flame as his warden. In his imprisonment, he adopted the name Tartyron and was called the Lord of Chaos. He waited, knowing those of the Realms would grow comfortable, lazy, and weak, and then he would escape to spread chaos once again.</p>
<p>Finally, during the time of the Bloodforge Wars ( 648 – 657 DR ), the wards failed and Tartyron broke free of his subterranean prison and into the world above, free to spread chaos through the Realms of Lands, Tides, and Fire, in an event known as Tartyron Unbound .</p>
