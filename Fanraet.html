<p>Overseer Fanraet was one of the leaders of the Cult of the Dragon in the ruins of Myth Drannor in 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR , Fanraet oversaw the excavations and research of the ruins of the Room of Words in Onaglym of Myth Drannor . Lieutenant Iolrak was directly reporting to the Overseer of the mission's progress. Even though there was not much progress in the recovery of the Word of Oblivion , his cultists were able to collect many other glyphs and words of power that opened previously sealed areas within the Dwarven Dungeons , Elven Catacombs , and other parts of Myth Drannor.</p>
<p>However, for his failures, Overseer Fanraet was beheaded by Grand Overseer Vidorus as per Kya Mordrayn 's orders. The unlucky overseer's head was sent as a dire warning to Overseer Sinod .</p>
