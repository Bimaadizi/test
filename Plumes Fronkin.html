<h2>Description</h2>
<p>"Plumes" was a foppish middle-aged human man with tan shin and gray hair. He wore a distinct green hat adorned with feathers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the city of Baldur's Gate was threatened by the encroaching army of the Cult of the Absolute . The crisis flooded the city with refugees, elevating tensions among its citizens and allowing a new power to take rulership of the city â€“ Lord Gortash . "Plumes" Fronkin reluctantly consumed the new lord's propaganda from the curbside preachers and from the pages of the Baldur's Mouth Gazette. Augur Harxkellan was a Gortash loyalist whose words attracted a crowd of gawkers with "Plumes" among them. However, he did not share the crowd's adoration of the new lord.</p>
