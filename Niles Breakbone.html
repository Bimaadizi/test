<p>Niles Breakbone was a knight in the Order of the Gauntlet as well as the commander of Camp Vengeance in Chult during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Niles was a devout servant of Tyr who was well-versed in traditional battles of two armies facing off against one another, however he was exasperated by guerrilla tactics that were so-often used in the jungle setting. He was a dedicated member of the Order of the Gauntlet and was seen as representing its best qualities, although the stain of the jungle campaign had led him to become desperate and unreasonable. He viewed Camp Vengeance as existing in a permanent state of emergency, and anyone who refused his orders—regardless of their relationship to the Order of the Gauntlet—was deemed a traitor to be punished or executed.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Niles commanded a force of over fifty soldiers, templars , and scouts , although their combat readiness was often hobbled by disease . He directed them to combat and purge the surrounding jungle of undead to little success. He tried to ensure that his forces had enough canoes or rowboats on hand to ferry them all to safety in case of an evacuation of Camp Vengeance, but was severely short-staffed in terms of both boats and hands to row them. Likewise, he was eager to conscript any passing adventurers who had demonstrated the skills to survive in the treacherous jungles.</p>
<p>Commander Breakbone was largely unable or uninterested in managing his Camp as he found the needs of his jungle campaign to be well outside of his expertise and comfort. He was prone to spend his days studying outdated maps of Chult and reviewing reports about supplies or missives from his superiors back in Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He oversaw a number of key lieutenants, many of whom demonstrated greater competence than he and thus would sometimes push back against his more unreasonable orders. These included Captains Ord Firebeard and Perne Salhana (leading the troops), Sister Cyas (leading the Camp's acolytes ), and Lorsa Bilwatal (who headed a group of Chultan scouts and guides). His expedition was also joined by one of his personal friends, the scout Wulf Rygor .</p>
<p>Niles grew suspicious of the old witch Nanny Pu'pu at Mbala . She, in turn, desired samples of his hair and fingernails.</p>
<p>His struggles at Camp Vengeance—if not his failures—were known to Alastar Bol , the Order of the Gauntlet's agent in Port Nyanzaru , and the merchant prince Wakanga O'tamu .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Commander Breakbone worked hard to avoid repeating the disaster of Camp Righteous , where his predecessor's arrogance cost the lives of many Order members before they were driven from the camp. However, he proved to be woefully inept at adapting to the jungle conditions.</p>
<p>During the events of the death curse , he came to suspect that Nanny Pu'pu knew something about the curse. His suspicions made their way to Wakanga O'tamu, who came to believe that Niles might know something about the curse's origins. When adventurers found the way to the lost city of Omu , Niles sent Captain Ord Firebeard and a handful of his soldiers to aid in the "war" against the evil that dwelt there.</p>
