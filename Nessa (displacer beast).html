<p>Nessa was the displacer beast servant of the orthon Yurgir for a time during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was wholly devoted to her master, even to the detriment of her own self-determination.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Nessa possessed darkvision and like others of her kind was exceptionally evasive in battle.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Nessa believed herself to be Yurgir's "heart-jewel", that they were true loves. Unfortunately, Yurgir had been ordering his merregon quartermaster to dose Nessa's meal with a concoction that included succubus spittle. That treatment incited Nessa's adoration for the orthon, and ensured her loyalty as a fighting companion.</p>
