<p>Fflar rallied what was left of the Akh’Velahr to make a last stand against the Army of Darkness as the beleaguered city was evacuated. He fought on as his forces dwindled. The conflict escalated to the Banes' Duel between the remnants of Myth Drannor's forces and those commanded by the supreme commander of the Army of Darkness, nycaloth general, Aulmpiter . [ page needed ] The battle raged for two days before the two generals faced off against each other in single combat. Fflar and Aulmpiter slew each other on Flamerule 15, after which the last of the city’s defenders were slain defending the portals being used in the retreat to Semberholme as the city finally fell.

<p>In the Year of the Rune Lords Triumphant, 1487 DR , the flying capital of the returned Empire of Netheril ― Thultanthar , known as Shade―loomed over Myth Drannor. Its dark arcanists sought to siphon away the magic of the city's mythal for their own ends. Numerous battles broke out as the Netherese forces and their mercenary armies assailed the free people of Myth Drannor.</p>
<p>High Captain Fflar led the charge, taking on any allies that would come to the city's defense. In one battle, Fflar and Coronal Ilsevele stood against a contingent of Sembian mercenaries, along with a few brave elven knights, having ordered most of their soldiers to reinforce another of the city's wards. Fflar was spared a second death defending his city, when he, Ilsevele, and what remained of their people were magically portalled away from Myth Drannor to Semberholme by the Srinshee, moments before Thultanthar came crashing down atop Myth Drannor, destroying the city for a second time.</p>
