<p>Mount Aergurl , known earlier as The Sleeper In The Sunrise , was a mountain in the Vast in north Faerûn . It lay within the Giantspike Mountains , a part of the Earthspur Mountains , and was due east of the village of Maskyr's Eye .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Described as a long rising peak, down Aergurl's slope ran a creek that had carved a high cleft. Though hazardous, this cleft formed a pass through the mountains, leading to high chilly valleys and ultimately the Glacier of the White Worm .</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>The pass was little known to humans in the mid–14 th century DR . The folk of Maskyr's Eye were aware of it, but did not talk about it to outsiders, but their hunters warned of an unnatural cold beyond the Sleeper.</p>
<p>The local dwarves had a legend of how the dwarf hero Aurgus killed a remorhaz single-handedly in the mountain pass.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Once, orcs marched through the pass to attack the dwarves who made their delves in the mountains near Kurth .</p>
<p>However, no army had come through it within the lifetime of humans by the late 1350s DR.</p>
