<p>The Guulstav of M'Raelhorrid was a unique enchanted staff that belonged to an Overseer of the Cult of the Dragon in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The weapon was a curved quarterstaff made of bone.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Guulstav of M'Raelhorrid possessed a powerful +5 enchantment that greatly increased the staff's bludgeoning damage output and guided the wielder's hand toward the target. It also boosted the wielder's intelligence, but it came at the cost of their physical strength. Whilst the wielder held The Guulstav , their mental willpower was fortified. Lastly, the weapon could cast the circle of death at will but held only five charges of the spell .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the cultists who were led by Kya Mordrayn made way into the ruins of the ancient elven city of Myth Drannor to take control of a pool of radiance in the cavern cellars of Castle Cormanthor . One of the Cult's Overseers was tasked with enthralling a group of drow from House Freth to guard a certain part of the prisons deep within the Elven Catacombs underneath Castle Cormanthor. The Guulstav of M'Raelhorrid belonged to the Overseer until he was defeated by the adventurers known as the Veiled Ones .</p>
