<h2>History</h2>
<p>Levia Shadewalker sometimes joked lustfully with Hessar about taking a step further.</p>
<p>Hessar kept his true nature hidden from most members of the Eye. Some who knew him suspected he was an agent of the shadovar , but in fact he was working for the vampire lord Kirenkirsalai . After he double-crossed Kirenkirsalai one too many times in 1480 DR , the vampire broke Hessar's neck and left him for the newly made vampire Vaelis to feed on.</p>
