<p>The Crytrapper noble house was one of the three 'grand families' of Crimmor , Amn , that held a major influence over the town.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>In addition to their important political power, the Crytrappers were a force to be reckoned with. In case of trouble, they could supplement the guard with 400 additional troops from the vicinity.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The head of the family, Lady Lamia Crytrapper , spent most of her time in the family mansion, Crytrapper Hall , which was located just outside Crimmor. Officially, her main residence was a big manor in the city of Athkatla .</p>
<p>The Crytrappers maintained secret granaries in caverns under Crytrapper Hill , called Hillwarrens . They could be reached through long tunnels running under the city, which were said to start in Crytrapper Hall itself, as well as various city buildings. Those caves were guarded and used by the Shadow Thieves to hide supplies and contraband, as well as members who needed to lay low.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The Crytrappers possessed numerous estates in Amn, especially around the city of Crimmor. In addition to Crytrapper Hall, they owned a few houses in town near the Wheel Ward and a number of taverns, inns, and smithies that were run by lesser family members.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Crytrapper family had a long and fruitful relation with the Shadow Thieves guild. It was said that the origin of this peculiar arrangement came from a debt high-ranking Shadow Thieves members owed to the family, who provided them alibis and protection when they were caught red-handed. Ever since, the Shadow Thieves made Crimmor a theft-free zone, and the Crytrappers provided them with safe-houses around the city.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1366 DR , the Crytrappers bought most of the city's inns and taverns from Lord Nadlok Bormul .</p>
