<p>A belt of frost giant strength , also known as a girdle of frost giant strength , was a magical belt that granted the wearer tremendous physical strength.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These belts were rather plain-looking in appearance made of thick leather and metal studs. They were considered amongst the middling variations of belts of giant strength .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The belt or girdle would imbue the wearer with the strength, though neither size nor girth, of a frost giant . Furthermore some belts and girdles also bestowed the wearer the ability to throw rocks and bend metal bars as if they had imbibed a potion of giant strength of the frost giant variety, such that one could throw a 156 lb (70.8 kg) rock for 10 yd (9.1 m).</p>
