<p>Ogrémoch ( pronounced : /ˈ oʊ g r ɛ m oʊ x / O-gre-mokh or : /ˈ oʊ g r eɪ m ɒk / OH-gray-mock ), also known as the Prince of Evil Earth , and the Mountain that Walks , was a powerful archomental from the Elemental Plane of Earth .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ogrémoch was described as a 50 ft (15 m) tall humanoid made of rock and crystal. His eyes resembled chipped obsidian and his body sparkled with mica . This was by no means an accurate description however, as few could claim to have ever seen him.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Among his numerous powers, Ogrémoch could sunder a piece of his rocky body and animate it into the form of a gargoyle .</p>
<p>He gained additional power within the presence of an elemental node , using them as a means to travel to the Prime Material plane .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The elemental war pick Ironfang was imbued with a portion of Ogrémoch's power.</p>
<h2>Domain</h2>
<p>Ogrémoch made his lair within the Plane of Earth, in a fortress known as Stonemire , on a plateau near the border with the Para-Elemental Plane of Magma . The heat was unbearable and fountains of molten stone, smoke and steam were used as decoration. Tales told of the foundations of the fortress being the entombed bodies of Ogrémoch's still-living enemies.</p>
<p>Other sages believed that Orgremoch lived in a big flat-topped mountain in the denser area of the plane of Earth. This massive mesa thrusted upward from the depths of the Plane of Earth, emerging within the largest known pockets of vacuum that once existed.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Ogrémoch was wholly selfish, regarding all the wealth within the earth as his own. This was not because he needed the wealth, but because of the principle of the thing. What he could not crush under his massive form, he outlasted.</p>
<p>Ogremoch always thought in the long term, usually devising not just one but three schemes for each of his upcoming projects. Others might have mistaken him for a slow thinker, but in truth, Ogremoch killed his enemies just as swiftly as other deities, but only if he saw no further opportunity to use them.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Ogrémoch's greatest desire was to destroy Sunnis , his good-aligned counterpart.</p>
<p>He was venerated by the Cult of the Black Earth and their prophet Marlos Urnrayle . The cave system known as the Black Geode was formed to closely resemble Ogrémoch's domain.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Bhaalspawn crisis , in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Ogrémoch allied himself with the drow Sendai and took up temporary residence within her enclave in southern Tethyr .</p>
<p>Circa the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR , the Cult of the Black Earth attempted to summon Ogrémoch to Faerûn by means of an earth portal within the Black Geode caverns.</p>
