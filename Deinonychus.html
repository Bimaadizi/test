<p>A deinonychus ( pronounced : / d eɪ ɪ n oʊ ˈ n aɪ k ʌ s / day-in-o-NY-kuss ), also known as a razortalon by the inhabitants of High Moor , and as a raptor on the Malatran Plateau , was a carnivorous species of dinosaur in the family of dinosaurs known as dromaeosaurs.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The deinonychus was a larger cousin of the velociraptor . They roughly stood about as tall as a human .</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>Deinonychuses could run as fast as the average horse .</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Deinonychus was a rather cunning creature.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>These dinosaurs liked to leap upon their prey, pinning them down with their claws and powerful rear talons. They then would often attempt to feed upon their prey while it was still alive.</p>
<h2>Sub-Species</h2>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Deinonychus tended to hunt in packs.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>These dinosaurs were most commonly found in the jungles of Chult , though they were also known to inhabit the Serpent Hills and the Stonelands . In the latter they hibernated in deep rifts near earth nodes and volcanic flows. They never raced along the heights of the Stonelands or ventured far from it, as they feared being eaten by dragons , dark horrors , or Zhent foulwings .</p>
<p>Beyond the Prime Material plane , some could be found in the Forbidden Plateau .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>In the land of Chult, the Batiri Shattered Spear tribe trained deinonychuses to act as watchdogs.</p>
