<p>Dragon breath , or breath weapon , known in Draconic as frahraek , ( svaerx in Tymantheran ) was a term used to refer to a special ability that was inherent to dragons and the majority of dragonkind , even those who merely had draconic ancestry.</p>
<h2>Nature of Breath</h2>
<p>The “breath” aspect of "dragon breath" was a bit of a misnomer, as it was not discharged from the lungs through exhalation. Rather, its stream of energy was more accurately vomited.</p>
<p>Depending upon the type of dragonkind or draconic ancestry, a breath weapon had different properties. There were nearly as many varieties of dragon breath as there were types of dragons. Though a number of dragons possessed the same type of breath and some possessed two distinct breaths.</p>
<h3>Biological</h3>
<p>In true dragons , the elemental or magical energies that granted a dragon their breath weapon were said to be generated by the heart and suffused throughout their body within the blood. The source was previously thought to be a large blood vessel called the fundamentum , or draconis fundamentum , but that merely channeled energy from the heart to a chamber in the gizzard. This organ stored a dragon's magical energies until they were needed to be unleashed as dragon breath.</p>
<p>Some breath types required an intrinsic temperature, which was maintained internally by the elemental or magical energy that flowed through a dragon's bloodstream. While other breath types, such as acid , didn't have any such necessities. Additionally, dragon eggs were inherently resistant to harm from the breath weapon of their parents, though this resistance waned the closer they came to hatching.</p>
<h3>Magic</h3>
<p>Dragon breath had an inherently magical nature to it. Some believed that the magic permeating the Prime Material plane empowered it. Others believed that the different species of chromatics , as well as metallics , were each imbued with elemental magic and their breath weapon was a manifestation of that elemental energy.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a dragon's breath could be affected by the magic that permeated within their lairs. Such as clinging to and lingering on those afflicted by it or recharging at an incredible rate.</p>
<p>Some individual dragons and creatures of draconic heritage were capable of channeling the destructive energy of their breath into some other magical or supernatural effect. For example, with sufficient practice some dragons were capable of shaping their breath weapon into a bipedal, elemental creature known as an animated breath .</p>
<p>There were a variety of spells that acted upon dragon breath. Such effects included compelling a dragon to exude their breath, diminishing a breath's effectiveness, suppressing a dragon breath entirely, or altering its appearance and properties. And some draconic spells —that being, spells unique to dragonkind—required the use of dragon breath to cast, such as dispelling breath .</p>
<p>There also existed spells that could protect someone against dragon breath. The Red Wizards of Thay had the spell protection from breath weapon, dragon . And each of the legendary orbs of dragonkind could grant immunity to the breath weapon of the variety of dragon that was keyed to them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On Toril , some scholars from Candlekeep proposed the proto-dragon theory , claiming that the dragons of their world gradually developed breath weapons through evolution. This theory purported that a common ancestor, ignidraco , developed a digestive tract that allowed them to regurgitate their own intestinal gas and ignite it with an enzymatic, hypergolic reaction in the back of their throats. The proto-dragon theory went on to claim that the ancestors of green dragons and black dragons developed their breath weapons from further modifying their digestive tracts.</p>
<p>There were many detractors to the proto-dragon theory, who pointed out that it could not fully explain the myraid of other elemental and non-elemental breath weapons that dragons possessed.</p>
