<p>Cashew soup was a thick, nut-based soup in the Realms whose primary seasoning was its namesake ingredient, cashew nuts.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , when Tennora Hedare 's Aunt Aowena and Uncle Eckhart came to visit her home in Waterdeep 's Castle Ward , a tenement building called the God Catcher , she spent most of the morning preparing a pot of cashew soup for them. This was accompanied by morsels of bread and salty ham , which took Tennora an hour to assemble and were largely made so that her aunt wouldn't notice that she was out of butter . However, Aunt Aowena was so displeased with the local conditions compared to their home back in the North Ward that she barely touched her bowl of soup.</p>
