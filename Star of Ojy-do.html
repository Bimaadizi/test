<h2>History</h2>
<p>When bandits besieged the village of Golden, the villagers were forced to defend themselves. The spiritual guide Ojy was pressed into work as a weaponsmith, though he knew little of metalworking. With every accurate strike of his hammer, he thanked his guiding spirits, and so the stars of Ojy-do were forged from the strength of his faith. They proved just as resilient.</p>
<p>By 1372 DR , stars of Ojy-do circulated around the northwest Faerûn and the Sword Coast North . As of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Stars of Ojy-do were available for purchase from Okuzo's Imports of Westgate , along with numerous magical items exported from the eastern realms by the immigrant shop owner.</p>
