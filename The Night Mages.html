<h2>History</h2>
<p>Once settled in Calimshan and established as a successful merchant, Felodar Aumar sent wizards to Athalantar to try and seize control of the realm on his behalf. These wizards were a threat to his brother, King Belaur Aumar for most of his reign, which lasted between 218 DR and 240 DR . These mages hid by day, combating the Magelords mostly during the hours of darkness. However, at least two of them, Maulygh and Nathgarl , joined the Magelords before 229 DR .</p>
<p>Though Felodar died in the Year of the Wandering Leucrotta, 239 DR , the Magelords were still combating one of his Sendings, Orthalar , until his assumed death in the Year of the Chosen, 240 DR .</p>
