<p>Crane Point was a promontory stretching into Ulls lake in the Highlands of the island of Gwynneth in the Moonshae Isles . It was likely named for the local rainbow cranes .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It was a spit of land that was most directly accessible only during low tide, when a strip of sand became traversable along the edges of Ulls.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the time of the human kingdom of Corwell , Crane Point was the site of a well-defended temple . After the takeover of Gwynneth by the fey of Sarifal , the temple and its surrounding defenses fell into ruin. Instead, Crane Point came to be the site of hunting forays. It featured stables for horses and an open field in which human slaves were made to assemble and disassemble pavilions for the enjoyment of the fey, who would hunt, drink, listen to music , and gawk at the cranes around the ruined temple.</p>
<p>In the late 1460s DR, Crane Point was the site of a battle between drow mercenaries in service to the ruling le Shay and a group of traitors attempting to smuggle a young le Shay princess, Amaranth , out of the realm. While Amaranth was somewhat successfully handed off to a hippogriff rider, all of those who had struggled to help her escape, notably the elf Valeanne and the dragonborn Shamasar and his underlings, all perished. Ten years later, the failure of the drow at Crane Point continued to be held over their heads by the le Shay.</p>
