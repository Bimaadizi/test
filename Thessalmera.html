<p>Thessalmeras were one of the four known thessalmonsters , a species of crossbred hybrid creatures. A thessalmera was the result of crossbreeding a thessalhydra and a chimera .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Thessalmeras had a large, reptilian body with a long tail which ended in a pair of large, sharp pincers. It's head was that of a lion , surrounded by a ring of between six to eight hydra -like heads. A second head, that of a small red dragon , was found just below the ring of serpentine heads, on the upper back.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The dragon head was capable of breathing a cone of fire. The cone of fire covered an area up to 50 feet (15 meters) wide at the widest point, with a range of up to 20 feet (6.1 meters). Thessalmeras had a natrual resistance to fire and were immune to acid and any petrification effects and spells.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Each serpentine head of a thessalmera acted independently and injected a target with poison for every bite. Its lion and dragon head had powerful jaws, capable of crushing armor. It used it's pincer to grasp a target and drag them closer to its many mouths.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>The primary head, controlling the thessalmera and containing its intelligence, was the lion head. If the lion head was fataly damaged, the dragon head acted as a backup head. If somehow both the lion and dragon heads were destroyed, the injured thessalmera became a semi-sentient and went into a berserk-like state, killing everything around it. It then retreated to its lair, remaining there until both the lion and dragon heads regrew.</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Thessalmeras were a carnivorous species. It preyed upon the livestock of human settlements, as well as the residents. It's favorite meal was the meat from a freshly killed human.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Thessalmeras were typically found in jungles and swamps, often living near human settlements.</p>
<p>In Northwest Faerûn , some were known to dwell within the Mere of Dead Men . Beyond Faerûn , some were known to be found in the land of Chult .</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>Juvenile thessalmeras were sometimes used as guards. Thessalmera eggs were worth up to 8,000 gp and a live juvenile up to 12,000 gp.</p>
