<p>Sardrin Olaundran was a member of the Olaundran merchant family in Delzimmer circa the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sardrin was an over-indulgent young man but quite active and robust. As a general rule, he wore fine clothing made from a true gold-colored (never yellow) cloth called shimmerweave , but also wore the latest fashions when they suited him.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Sardrin and his brother Elvolaer were very much alike, which occasionally led to competition and even heated disagreements, but more often they were a team, either causing trouble, getting into trouble, or both. Like the whole Olaundran clan, they never bargained over the price of goods and services, always paying full price. As a point of pride, they only paid attention to money when gambling.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Sardrin's hobbies included hawking and hunting, gambling, and wagering on fights between beasts or slaves (usually mudwrestling).</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Sardrin was the third child and second eldest son of Yolaun Olaundran , one of the de facto leaders of the family business. He was the grandson of the patriarch of the clan, "Old" Gauthklaun . After him, there were three younger siblings.</p>
