<p>Spirecoast was an ancient Netherese outpost built in the Sword Mountains during its early period of expansion.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The outpost was located within the foothills of the southern Sword Mountains, west of what would become the Westwood .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Spirecoast came about during Netheril 's Silver Age ( −2758 DR to −2208 DR ), when the Terraseer directed Netheril to explore its western frontier. Reported among the first promising sites in 1491 NY (−2368 DR) , alongside Old Owl Well and Kryptgarden Falls , Spirecoast served as a caravan stop, watering station, and fortified watchpost amid Netheril's westward expansion. Secured with warriors and overseen by arcanists , it was equipped with crystal balls that were used to spy on the surrounding area, especially the nearby elves of Illefarn . The outpost was also fitted with a mythallar that powered quasimagical items , but the need for expeditions to venture further and further afield caused the creation of some of Netheril's first proper magical items that could be used anywhere.</p>
