<p>Housebreaker harnesses , known in thieves' cant as a spider , were versatile harnesses designed to aid thieves and serious cat burglars with climbing and breaking into buildings.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Housebreaker harnesses consisted of a number of leather straps that linked together, one to be hooked around each thigh and over each shoulder, as well as one broad leather strap that was to be secured around the waist. A number of hooks, safety clips, or adjustable clamps were attached to these belts. Though other designs instead incorporated up to eight or more additional straps of varied length, usually measuring no more than 2 feet (0.61 meters), at the end of which would be small metal rings.</p>
<p>With both designs a thief could affix all manner of tools to the attachments, though their primary purpose was for having rope attach to them or for tether lines. This eliminated the threat of falling for a thief, allowed them to secure themselves to walls, and gave them free use of their hands for other tasks, such as lockpicking , cutting glass , checking for traps, etc.</p>
<p>A housebreaker harnesses could equally be worn with ease over clothing or leather armor .</p>
