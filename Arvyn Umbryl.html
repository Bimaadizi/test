<h2>Description</h2>

Diagonally across Arvyn's left forearm stretched a scar from his old adventuring days.</p>

<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Arvyn owned the Smiling Satyr tavern, the hill it stood on, and the two fields on either side, which he allowed to be used as campsites. Among the antique weapons , broken shields , skulls of monsters, and other trophies of adventures past on the walls, behind the bar were two crossed magic battleaxes of dancing . Arvyn, and only Arvyn, could command these to animate to defend himself and his staff.</p>
