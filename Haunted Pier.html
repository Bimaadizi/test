<p>The Haunted Pier was an area where ships could dock along the treacherous river that flowed through the Shadowfell city of Evernight . However, after that river became a stream of lava in the 15 th century DR , only ghost ships could use the docks.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Several piers made of stone were all that still stood in the lava. Ghostly ships would occasionally materialize alongside one of these piers and dock as if to unload cargo. Although no one was ever seen on board, the creaking of the ships' rigging and the sounds of moving cargo could be heard throughout the area. The ships would eventually depart—having lingered for as little as a few hours to as long as several days—and vanish upstream.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The piers stood on the south bank of the river just upstream from the three bridges that connected the north and south shores. Nearby was a fire-damaged warehouse that served as an outpost for representatives from Thay .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the river was still navigable by normal boats, unwary sailors were frequently shipwrecked while sailing into Evernight. The river became overrun with lava following the events of the Ruining in the Year of Knowledge Unearthed, 1451 DR , when the eruption of Mount Hotenow on the Material Plane caused its twin in the Shadowfell to also erupt. However, the Shadowfell volcano never stopped erupting, thus leading to the river becoming a perpetual flow of lava. This led to the abandonment and haunting of the piers.</p>
