<p>The Keryjek Ridge was a mountain range within the Great Glacier .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Keryjek Ridge was the longest mountain range in the Great Glacier. It began near the Lugsaas Chain and ran north through the interior of the Great Glacier, forming a natural barrier between the Alpuk and Angalpuk regions. Its mountains were tall, usually 8,000​ to ​10,000 feet (2,400​ to ​3,000 meters) in height with some peaks reaching 15,000 feet (4,600 meters).</p>
<p>The Keryjek Ridge was considered the most beautiful sight in the Great Glacier. Due to fairy ice deposits, the tallest peaks glimmered like rainbows. Its valleys were filled with clean frozen lakes and lush evergreens circled the mountainsides.</p>
