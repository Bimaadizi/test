<p>Following his human death, Ardenor was reincarnated by his wizard friend Grangor .

The five separate divisions of the Chill traveled far to the North to this end.</p>
<p>Ardenor and his mercenaries were involved in the events of the iron crisis in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR . Along with the Blacktalons they led raids on caravans traveling along the Coast Way and rerouted any iron shipments to their overseer Tazok .
