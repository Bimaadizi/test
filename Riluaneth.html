<p>Riluaneth was an inhabitant of Cormanthyr in the 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>He was rather tall and muscular, for an elf.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>His streak of cruelty was almost controlling.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was resentful, and delighted in teasing and tormenting his cousins.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Riluaneth was taken in by the Alastrarra family after his parents died.</p>
<p>On 241 DR , when Elminster Aumar came to the Alastrarra house transformed into Iymbryl Alastrarra and wearing his kiira , he stumbled upon Riluaneth playing a game of spellcircles with a maid. He sent a blade towards Elminster, which he dodged, only to find its true quarry was a servant; Elminster then stole control of the blade. While the two fought mentally over control of the sword, Riluaneth reached for a dagger; rather than risk the magic in it, Elminster cast a spell which Iymbryl had stored in the kiira for precisely such a time. The spell slew Riluaneth on the spot.</p>
