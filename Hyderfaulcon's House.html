<p>Hyderfaulcon's House was a barn masquerading as a tavern located within the fortified city of Yeshpek on the Lake of Steam in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The exterior of the establishment was well-decorated, and the employees sported fancy uniforms, but nothing could hide the fact that Hyderfaulcon's House was a converted barn.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Drinks here were watered down and the only fare available was a roasted quail with nuts and gravy that was so salty that patrons couldn't taste how well the meat was cooked. Hyderfaulcon's House was usually quite loud since the low prices attracted Yeshpek's working class.</p>
