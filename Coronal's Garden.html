<p>The Coronal's Garden was a part of the Coronal's palace in Cormanthor .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When Naeryndam Alastrarra accompanied Elminster Aumar before the Coronal Eltargrim Irithyl , they materialized by a large, winged statue of a panther, which glowed blue. Two moss paths joined by it. Will o' wisps danced above, some luminous night-flowers grew around the garden, and faint, harping sounds could be heard all across. One of the mossy paths went past small streams and pools, into small bowers with curved seats between shrubs, finally up into some steps between two spiral-barked trees towards a patio. The patio was broad, paved, and lit by more luminous plants.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>At least one watchnorn , Braerindra Calauth , dwelt there as a protector.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 241Â DR , Elminster Aumar was brought before the Coronal by Naeryndam Alastrarra through the garden.</p>
