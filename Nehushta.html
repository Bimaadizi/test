<p>Nehushta was a primordial artificer who fought against the gods during the Dawn War .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nehushta was a massive being made of different metallic alloys who shined star-white when roused to fury. Over the years, she modified her own body with fantastic assemblages of gears, blades, and other golem -like improvements.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Genasi from the world of Abeir believed Nehushta was the creator of both Abeiran and Torilian genasi, having created them in the dawn of time to serve as her slaves. Members of the Burned believed themselves to be direct descendants of the original genasi crafted by the primordial. The ancient artifact known as the Birthing Furnace was a creation of Nehushta as well, lending credence to those claims. Nehushta was also credited as the creator of the dreaded anaxims .</p>
<p>Before the separation of Abeir-Toril , Nehushta erected the fortress of Glaur in the northern lands of Gontal to serve as a central front during the Dawn War. After the primordials were defeated and Ao split Abeir-Toril into the twin worlds, Abeir and Toril , Glaur was transported to the world of Abeir. Nehushta isolated herself in her fortress until the War of Fang and Talon , when she was killed by traitorous dragons . Her worshipers believed that the tears she wept when she was betrayed formed the Quicksilver Lake of Glaur.</p>
<p>Even when she was reported as dead by the dragons of Abeir, scholars debated whether if this was actually true or not, and many believed a living remnant of Nehushta herself was hidden in the ruins of Glaur.</p>
