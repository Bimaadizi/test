<p>A urophion was created by inserting an illithid tadpole into a roper , resulting in these miserable creatures. They were used as guards and sentries in illithid outposts and cities.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A urophion was a truly unique creature, and was evidence of the willingness of the illithid to attempt to create ceremorphs even from the most unlikely organisms. What was truly unique about the urophion was that it was the only known case of ceremorphosis working on a cold-blooded creature. A urophion was nearly identical in every regard to a roper in appearance.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>A urophion was gifted with acute senses that allowed it to sense creatures over long distances. A urophion's main method of destroying its foes was to stun its prey with psionics , and then stretch out its tentacles, which were up to 50 feet (15 meters) long. The urophion would then grasp its stunned victim and then pull on it. When the prey had reached the urophion, it would consume the prey's brain.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Urophions acted as guardians and sentinels in illithid cities. They were similar to ropers in behavior, predominately solitary, sedentary, and stationary. Urophions were just as intelligent as regular illithids, with psionic abilities that were nearly as powerful. Even though in almost every regard they were equally powerful as illithids, they were still considered lesser by their illithid overlords and were forced into dreary servitude. Their only honor was that when they died they would be fed to the elder brain. Most remained loyal to the illithids, yet some did tend to become independent and wander off on their own.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Oryndoll around 1370 DR , there were around 320 urophions. They guarded the access tunnels just within reach of the elder brain's influence.</p>
