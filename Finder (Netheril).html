<p>Finder was the name given to a Netherese human who found the Nether Scrolls in the Nether Age .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Finder was a descendant of Therion Gers surreptitiously given a serpentskin tome by Terraseer which he used to explore Aryvandaar ruins while an apprentice in Glaurachyndaar .</p>
<p>He found the scrolls in 326 NY (−3533 DR) while searching cellars of the ruins that would later be rebuilt into the fortress Citadel of the Mists west of the Far Horns Forest . One account says the ruins were from a strange species who apparently had more than two legs, likely quadrupedal, and who used the wall and the floor equally. After he found the scrolls and studied them for years, he brought them to the wizards of Seventon and Zenith .</p>
