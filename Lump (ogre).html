<p>Lump the Enlightened was a particularly canny and articulate ogre mercenary that worked on the Sword Coast during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Lump was quite well-spoken for an ogre and did the speaking for his group of three. While he displayed eloquence and a discerning taste for food not often found among other ogres, Lump was just as greedy and gluttonous as they came.</p>
<p>He could be considered one of the faithless as he did not worship any particular deity.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>While Lump maintained his exceptional intelligence originated from his healthy appetite and varied diet, it was likely the effect of the headband of intellect he wore.</p>
<p>He also kept with him a war horn , that allowed employers to call for he and his companions in battle.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He worked alongside two less-intelligent ogres, Chock and Fank .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Lump and his subordinates worked for the cult of the Absolute , keeping post at the ruined town of Moonhaven on the Risen Road . In exchange for gold and their choice of goblins to eat, the trio were responsible to ensuring that anyone that passed through town was marked with the brand of the Absolute , lest they venture too near the cult's outpost at the Shattered Sanctum .</p>
<p>Lump had no loyalty to the Absolute beyond his love of the gold and food they offered.</p>
