<p>A viol was a six-string instrument similar to a violin .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Viols had a deeply resonant sound that conveyed melancholy themes very well. They could be played on their own or as part of larger ensembles. Viols were particularly favored by dwarves , owing to their deep and dark sounds.</p>
<p>Viols were available for purchase through Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue , produced by the same craftsmen from Waterdeep and Selgaunt who produced the violins sold through the catalogue.</p>
