<p>Throstulgrael , or "Velvet" , was a young male black dragon who laired in the Flooded Forest in the lands of the Moonsea and the Vast in north Faerûn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>

<p>Velvet still lived by 1374 DR .</p>
<p>In 1489 DR , Throstulgrael tried to enslave the lizardfolk tribes of Twilight Marsh near Phlan , but his plot was ruined by some adventurers. The black dragon also captured the skilled drow assassin Yusten Karas , who was forced to work for him. Later that year, he was confronted by an adventuring party sent to recover some items from the dragon's lair but when he seemed to have been killed, he mysteriously resurrected as a dracolich and flew away.</p>
<h2>Allies</h2>
<p>In the 14th century, Velvet was supported by a Cult of the Dragon cell based near either Calaunt or Kurth . Though not particularly large or powerful, the cell was well organized and its members were close-knit. They feuded with Malachite's own Cult cell.</p>
