<p>The gigantes , known by some simply as giants , were a race of monstrous elder giants created by the primeval goddess Gaea . Despite their other name, gigantes were nothing like the true giants found on the Prime Material .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A gigante was large in stature and had a rather human -like appearance, but they had serpents in place of where feet should be or serpent tails where legs should be. They could move with incredible speed.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The gigantes possessed incredible power, being living embodiments of volcanic power. Each individual gigantes had some sort of unique power, such as a regenerative nature or a fear aura.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<h3>Homeland</h3>
<p>These creatures could be found on Othrys , the first layer of the plane of Carceri .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Gigantes harbored a deep seething hatred for the deities that made up the Olympian pantheon . They would never pass up an opportunity to cause some form of harm to either them or their minions.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The goddess Gaea convinced one of her children, the greater titan Cronus , to overthrow his father Uranus and thus avenge her mistreatment, in retaliation for him having locked away their more monstrous children. Cronus did so, wounding his father so severely that he allegedly perished. The blood from his wounds fell upon Gaea, fertilizing her once more, causing the creation of the Furies and the gigantes. However, Cronus went back on his word and refused to free his monstrous brethren. Furious, Gaea laid a curse upon Cronus, proclaiming that one day his own children would usurp him in turn. Eventually Gaea's curse came to pass and Cronus was usurped by his own son Zeus , who alongside his siblings led the way for the creation of the Olympian pantheon and the imprisonment of their forefathers, the greater titans, in the plane of Carceri.</p>
<p>Not long after the gigantes challenged the rule of the newly formed Olympian pantheon, having been directed against them by their mother Gaea in an effort to free the greater titans. However, the Olympians held fast against the gigantes and ultimately overcame them. The gigantes were then imprisoned in Carceri alongside the titans.</p>
<p>Millenia later, in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , a gigante appeared on Toril and attacked the settlement of Elventree in Cormanthor . The goddess Mystra sent one of her avatars to the scene to do battle with gigante and protect the settlement.</p>
