<h2>Script</h2>
<p>Speakers of the Shaaran tongue used the Dethek alphabet of the dwarves , which they learned from gold dwarven traders from the Great Rift before the rise of the Shoon Imperium .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to some sources, Shaaran was one of the Akalaic languages , which were all part of the Chessan languages group. This made Shaaran distantly related to such languages as Chessentan . Others claimed that the language was unrelated to any other Faerunian tongue, though over the centuries had adapted some loan words from cultures trading in the area.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Surnames in Shaaran were composed of multiple words. Common examples included Cor Marak, Hiaw Harr, Laumee Harr, Moq Qo Harr, Taw Harr, and Woraw Tarak. Common male names included Awar, Cohis, Damota, Gewar, Hapaw, Laskaw, Moktar, Senesaw, and Tokhis. A female might be named Anet, Bes, Dahvet, Faqem, Idim, Lenet, Moqem, Neghet, or Sihvet.</p>
