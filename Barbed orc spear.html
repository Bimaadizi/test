<p>Barbed orc spears were polearms created by orcish smiths.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Barbed orc spears were crude weapons. They had sturdy wooden hafts, topped with a cruel barbed spear head. When willed in battle, these barbed weapons dealt additional piercing damage to their targets.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , barbed orc spears were among many smuggled orcish-foged weapons provided to the looming army of Gorgomorz - Daggerford's Devil through his alliance with the Zhentarim . Many of these weapons were stockpiled in pirate smuggling sea caves in the Crab's Claw Coast , southwest of Daggerford, shipped there on the Barracuda , through the harbors of Daggerford.</p>
