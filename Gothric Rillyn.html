<p>Gothric Rillyn was an unsavory member of the noble patriar Rillyn family of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gothric was a sarcastic and foppish man. He had light skin and blonde hair. His mustache and hair were primed and styled to match his frilly finery.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Gothric Rillyn crossed the wrong man. He filched something of value from the new crime boss of Baldur's Gate, the man known as the Stone Lord . By extension, Gothric angered the Cult of the Absolute that had indoctrinated the Stone Lord and he ended up being buried alive in the Lower City Graveyard . The headstone that marked his grave was defaced with: "Rotting place of Gothric Rillyn." He shared a coffin with some unfortunate, disturbed dead who was buried with an enchanted +1 rapier , and a magical pike . Gothric may have survived the burial with Tymora 's blessing as the group known as the Absolute Adversaries could've come across the buried man who was making a bit too much noise for a dead body.</p>
