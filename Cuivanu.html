<p>Cuivanu , known as the spirit tree , was a great and mystical tree that grew at the heart of the Misty Vale in south Faerûn . Its location was lost when the Misty Vale was destroyed following the Spellplague , leading it to be known as the Dead Vale .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cuivanu was said to be a flowering tree located in a hidden glade deep in the Misty Vale. Its sap had potent curative and life-giving powers.</p>
<p>The tree was sacred to the elves of Elfharrow —once known as the grugach —and they prayed and dreamed that the tree had somehow survived the devastation that had befallen the once-holy ground of the Dead Vale. Their warriors were known to pledge their lives to the tree as they committed to suicidal attacks.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The location of the tree was lost sometime after the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , when the shifting climate and disruptions of magic caused by the Spellplague began to erode the Misty Vale. As of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , elven tribesfolk of Elfharrow still desperately sought the tree, hoping that it had somehow survived and that its healing magic could be used to restore their homeland. Their worst fear was that the tree was already dead, rotted, or worse.</p>
