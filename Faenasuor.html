<p>Faenasuor was an ancient garrison city of the sea elf kingdom of Aryselmalyr , as well as one of the major sea elf colonies of the Sea of Fallen Stars in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The structures of this city were heavily encrusted in coral . It also held some of the most pristine and representative pieces of ancient Aryselmalyn art.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Faenasuor was located on the continental slopes east of Starmantle , approximately 20 miles (32,000 meters) north of that surface city, in an area that solely the sea elves referred to as the Lost Lands .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Faenasuor was originally founded in the year −8060 TS (−8130 DR) by the kingdom of Aryselmalyr, albeit under another name that by the 14 th century DR had long since been lost to time. In the year −181 TS (−251 DR) , the city was abandoned and over time it was buried by sea storms under tons of detritus and silt.</p>
<p>Around the 13 th century DR, this garrison city was rediscovered and exacted by the High Mages of Sylkiir . By the year 1369 TS (1299 DR) , it was officially resettled by sea elves and other students of history and was given the new name of Faenasuor. Many of these sea elves who settled at the city sought to profit off of the abundant pearl beds that surrounded it.</p>
