<p>The Wolf's Pelt Inn was an inn located in Targos one of the Ten Towns .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The building faced Maer Dualdon so fishermen could see the front door from the lake. On the outside, the inn looked worn out but this was only because of the harsh weather of the Icewind Dale region. The inn itself was a one-story building, approximately 40 by 80 ft. in size.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The Wolf's Pelt Inn had a barroom, common room, private rooms, storage, and a kitchen.</p>
<p>The barroom was always filled with smoke, loud clients' voices, especially in the evening when the fishermen finished their day's work. The large warm hearth was located in the center of the northern wall. The bar was next to a fireplace in the northwestern corner of the room.</p>
<p>The common room (5 sp a night) contained 26 cots, half of which was almost always occupied. The room had a faint smell of sweat and woodsmoke lingering in the air, but the room itself was always clean. The hearth in the room provided warmth and light, even though additional candles were scattered around the place.</p>
<p>The inn had only 3 private rooms (1 gp a night). Each had two beds, a table, a bureau by the north wall with burning incense on it.</p>
<p>The storage room contained most of the inn's preserved foods, like salted meat , cheeses , ale , fish , etc.</p>
<p>The kitchen was not a big space that usually had one or all of the Winters children working there.</p>
<p>The inn's clientele consisted mostly of tough leathery-skinned fishermen and harbor-working folks of the town who cared mostly about food and drink after a long day, and not gossip nor adventurers.</p>
<h2>Staff</h2>
<p>Circa 1369 DR the inn was run by Kalas Winters, he greeted the customers, gladly exchanged stories of adventure, and manned the bar. His wife Beartrid Winters loudly and warmly greeted most of the arriving folks, while flirting with them but stayed close to the kitchen to keep an eye on her daughter. Sims Winters was a 13-year old boy helping his mother and sister around the inn. Dorthy Winters was a 17-year old daughter who was put to work in the kitchen. Young lasses Tairis and Parcilla waited the tables.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1369 DR , the building was owned by Kalas Winters . The same year Boswell Peddywinkle (secretly Celerum the Black) used the inn to house his hired caravan guards and adventurers on their search for the Accursed Tower of Damien Morienus .</p>
