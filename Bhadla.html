<p>Bhadla was a guide that lived in the Anauroch desert during the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like other D'tarig , Bhadla was rather short, standing about 4 ft (1.2 m) tall. He dressed in a white burnoose and wore a turban upon his head.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Bhadla was a pragmatic and unscrupulous man that took advantage of situations to benefit himself, so long as he could get away without harm. He was not above scavenging from the dead, or betraying those with whom he worked.</p>
<p>Like many others of his kin he acted largely out of fear and suspicion, in part due to the threat the Zhent influence posed on all the peoples of the desert.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>While working as a spy for the Zhentarim, Bhadla was given a ring of invisibility .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Bhadla worked with an assistant named Musalim , who aided him during his travels across the desert.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , Bhadla and Musalim began working for Lander , an agent of the Harpers that was working against the Zhentarim. At the same time, they were offering information to Lander's adversary Yhekal , an agent of the Zhentarim. The senior Bhadla apprised him of the movements of some Bedine tribes that resisted the efforts of the Zhentilar army, as they sought to gain control of the desert by means of military force.</p>
<p>After riding across the desert with Musalim Lander to El Rahalat , a sandstorm separated the trio and left the Harper to brave the harsh winds of the desert alone. Bhadla made his way to El Rahalat, to attend to his master Yhekal during his meeting with Sheikh Sa'ar of the Bait Mahwa . His treachery was revealed when Lander managed to arrive at the meeting just in time to appeal to the sheikh.</p>
<p>Bhadla continued his work for Yhekal and the Zhentarim, using magic invisibility to spy on a meeting between the sheikhs of the Bait Mahwa and the Raz'hadi at the Well of the Chasm . He took on one final mission with a Zhent assassin to kill Lander once and for all. While Bhadla managed to inflict upon the Harper a wound with a poison -laced blade, he died moments later when his throat was slit by the sorceress Ruha .</p>
