<p>The Foreigners' Sea , also known as Bahr al-Ajami to native Zakharans or the Segara Sea to natives of Kara-Tur , was found due east of mainland Zakhara and south of the Yehimal Mountains .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Foreigners' Sea was nestled in the giant shadow of the Yehimal Mountains inland, connecting the continent of Zakhara to the rest of the eastern world by sea as the mountain range did by land. Its waters covered the geographical regions of both east and northeast Zakhara, beginning in the south where the Crowded Sea ended at the island of Afyal and continuing north and west into the vast empires of the east.</p>
