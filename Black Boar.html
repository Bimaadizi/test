<p>The Black Boar was an expensive and posh but crammed inn in Iriaebor , known for its slow service, small rooms, and meager food.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The inn employed too few staff for its abundant clientele, resulting in notoriously slow service and small-portioned meals.</p>
<p>By 1357 DR , the Black Boar put its name on ale commonly found in expensive inns and taverns across the Western Heartlands .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Black BoarÂ inn stood to the southwest of the High Tower of Iriaebor , on the road from the city's docks, right where it split in two to circle around the tower. It was a prime location for an expensive establishment, an envy of merchants, who even tried to murder for it on a few occasions. Because of that, the owner of the inn preferred to stay incognito, keeping his name from the general public.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The inn was a large twin-towered building.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The tiny rooms and halls of the inn were furnished in exquisite luxury. The snobbery of the clientele guaranteed the establishment's full occupancy by the nightfall every single day.</p>
