<p>Mishtan was one of many villages within the Great Vale of Mulhorand , later deemed to be a small city, and was one of the nation's sixteen preceptual governments. It stood out from others due to being one of the centers of Osiris worship in Mulhorand and because it was the gateway to the Land of the Dead —the resting place of Mulhorand's pharaohs and their families.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Mishtan had a preceptual government, which ruled over both the city and the nearby Land of the Dead. It was largely governed by the local Osiran clergy, of the temple known as the Gateway to the Afterworld . Its ruler in the 14 th century DR , as recommended to the vizier by the Osiran priesthood, was the Precept Temis .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Tombs for the pharaohs and other construction projects were a never-ending occurrence in Mishtan, as the Osiran clergy were in charge of the Land of the Dead. During the flood season, the village was typically teeming with artisans, masons, and slaves .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Mishtan's regular population in 1357 DR was 2,000, but could easily swell to 30,000 if a large construction project was taking place. These surplus workers would dwell within makeshift homes surrounding Mishtan. By 1372 DR , the stable population of Mishtan was around 6,459.</p>
