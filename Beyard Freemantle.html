<p>Beyard "Bey" Freemantle was a human warrior and one of the founding members of the Knights of Myth Drannor , originally known as the Swords of Eveningstar, in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bey was a muscled warrior with the bearing of a skilled swordsman, appearing alongside his friend Agannor Wildsilver when they first encountered the original Swords.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Bey was known to snore "like the call of a distant and melancholy war horn" while sleeping.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Bey was good friends with Agannor Wildsilver , another warrior who joined the Swords at the same time.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the earliest days of the Knights of Myth Drannor in the Year of the Spur, 1348 DR , he and his friend Agannor joined the adventuring group while at the The Moon and Stars tavern in Waymoot .</p>
<p>During his time with the Knights, Bey participated in exploring the Haunted Halls in Eveningstar .</p>
<p>He and Agannor ultimately betrayed the Knights when a Zhentarim mage implanted them with mindworms . Under this influence, they murdered Taeriana and Kestra , the two coinlasses who had unwittingly infected them with the mindworms. They soon after killed their fellow Knight, Martess Ilmra , when she discovered their deeds.</p>
<p>Bey met his end later that day while attempting to reach the Zhentarim mage Whisper through a portal, dying when Whisper's magical guardians—a chuul , ettin , and umber hulk —were turned against him. He died alongside Agannor and a Zhentarim agent who had been leading them.</p>
