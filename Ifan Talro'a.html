<p>Ifan Talro'a ( pronounced : /ˈ i f ɔː n t ɑː l ˈ r oʊ ɑː / EE-fawn tal-ROH-ah ) was one of the merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru , Chult during the late 15 th century DR . He held a monopoly over the sale of live beasts within the city.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was a Chultan nobleman who carried a heavy staff that he could bang on the ground for emphasis.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was known for being exceptionally avaricious in his dealings. He was prone to arrogance, jealousy, distrust, and scheming.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Ifan Talro'a dealt in all manner of domesticated and near-wild animals native to Chult , from adorable pets and companions to beasts of burden and mounts . Anyone wishing to buy or sell such a creature, or to have such creatures trained, had to go through him or his sellers. Among the creatures that Ifan sold were flying monkeys , giant lizards , and even dinosaurs (most notably ankylosaurus , deinonychus , hadrosaurus , and triceratops ). He also sold flying snakes , but only to his allies. His beasts ranged in price from as little as 100 gold pieces to as much as 500 for large dinosaurs. He generally was willing to purchase beasts captured from the jungle as well (as well as the eggs of dinosaurs), although only for no more than half the price at which he would sell them. As he held a monopoly on the beast trade, there were no other legal means to sell such animals.</p>
<p>His dozens of beast merchants and handlers throughout Port Nyanzaru also acted as his spies, allowing his eyes and ears to infest every marketplace in the city. As part of his monopoly, he implicitly controlled the dinosaur pens in Port Nyanzaru's Tiryki Anchorage .</p>
<p>As a merchant prince, Ifan Talro'a participated in their council that governed Port Nyanzaru from the palace of Goldenthrone . He was known to have forced adventurers to prove themselves in single combat against a dinosaur right in the middle of the palace.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Ifan Talro'a maintained a palatial and opulent villa in Port Nyanzaru, which also served as a secure fortress for him and his business. The villa and gardens were home to colorful flying snakes and were decorated with Chultan relics and vases taken from tombs within the jungle. Ifan was a collector of such ancient Chultan relics, and desired to acquire more treasures (such as the Skull Chalice of Ch'gakare ). He was not above marking someone for death if they refused to give him something he wanted for this collection.</p>
<p>Ifan also maintained a secret office in a bunker beneath the dinosaur pens in Tiryki Anchorage. From here, he personally handled communications with his less savory allies in the jungle. He protected such secrets with summoned shadows and shadow demons .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was considered an ally of the Zhentarim and surrounded himself with dangerous and influential agents from the mercenary organization. They collaborated in many of his schemes.</p>
<p>He also acted as a spy of sorts for the yuan-ti of Omu , although he maintained plausible deniability by never confirming exactly with whom he was working. He used his flying snakes to give them warning of any approaching interlopers searching for Chultan treasure. Because of this arrangement, the Emerald Enclave came to suspect Ifan of luring unsuspecting travelers to their deaths in the jungle. One of their agents, Screaming Wind , sought to expose him as a traitor to Port Nyanzaru.</p>
<p>As he was generally distrusting of everyone he met, Ifan had no true friends, family or meaningful relationships. He was jealous of fellow merchant princes Ekene-Afa for her fame and Wakanga O'tamu for his arcane power.</p>
<p>Like the other merchant princes, the Ytepka Society supported him as part of their mission to ensure stability in Port Nyanzaru, although he was also willing to use them to pursue his more selfish goals. He further employed a number of underlings and mercenaries, and had a seneschal by the name of Mtu Barua .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, Ifan Talro'a was one of the wealthiest individuals in Port Nyanzaru. He had not needed to work his way up to wealth and status unlike several of his fellow merchant princes. "Talro'a" was his family's old dynastic name that he had adopted as his surname.</p>
<p>Prior to his ascension as a merchant prince over the newly independent Port Nyanzaru, trade in jungle animals was controlled by Amnian trading companies, such as Charisk Expeditionary Outfitters .</p>
<p>When Port Nyanzaru became overrun with the fiendish forces of the pirate captain Idrianne Smoke , Ifan Talro'a devised a plan to unleash the many dinosaurs locked up in the the city's dinosaur pens to let them rampage through the enemy forces. He was delighted to be the only person with the power to authorize such a plan.</p>
