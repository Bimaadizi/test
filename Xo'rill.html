<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Xo'rill could be found manning a cattle stockade in the illithid Black Market of Samarach. Xo'rill was less interested in dealing with other races but its own. The mind flayer did not tolerate visitors needlessly disturbing merchants nor other customers. Xo'rill also ran a spy network across Samarach that ensured business and the safety of the illicit tradepost. Xo'rill's pens were usually filled with slaves â€“ cattle for sale or delicious morsels to consume by illithids themselves. In 1374 DR, its stockades held a band of deep gnomes , including the evil wizard named Chir Darkflame .</p>
