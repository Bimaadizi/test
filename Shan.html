Cynda was abducted in Almraiven by two Firesoul genasi and teleported to Calimport where she was forced to fight in the arena. Shan traveled with Corvus and Cephas to Calimport where Cephas was reunited with his father the Pasha but Shan was sent to the gladiator stables. The Pasha scheduled a fight between Shan and Cynda and made it the main event.
