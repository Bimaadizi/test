<p>An ash zombie was a special type of undead created by the powerful energies released in the wake of the eruption of Mount Hotenow , in 1451 DR . People also called them scrabblers and dustwalkers .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Many ash zombies appeared quite small—no larger than a child or a halfling —owing to how their intense heat caused their bodies to shrivel.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Ash zombies were normal undead warped and mutated by the powerful energies released by the eruption of Mount Hotenow.</p>
<p>Ash zombies were capable of creating unnatural ashes from their bodies and using them as a weapon. When attacked, a puff of this ash might erupt from the ash zombie.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ash zombies first appeared after the eruption of Mount Hotenow.</p>
<p>When the Red Wizards of Thay discovered them, around 1463 DR , they began to research ways to create ash zombies artificially. They also discovered that ash zombies developed a taste for younger victims.</p>
<p>Around 1479 DR , ash zombies were common in the abandoned parts of Neverwinter, and in Thundertree .</p>
