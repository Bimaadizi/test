<h2>History</h2>
<p>On 241 DR , Nanthleene was at the Alastrarra manor when Elminster Aumar first came to Myth Drannor . She entered the room where Elminster, in the guise and with the kiira of Iymbryl Alastrarra , was holding Filaurel Alastrarra hostage to keep the rest of the family from slaying him. After they decided to let him go and have the Coronal judge him, per the head of the house, Nanthee gawked at the human a little too much.</p>
