<p>Nettle was a common edible plant found in the outskirts of Neverwinter and the Sword Coast North that possessed curative properties and could be used as a material component .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nettle was known for its tiny "hairs" that covered the plant and upon contact with unprotected skin caused it to itch, sting, and burn.</p>
<p>When eaten raw, nettle tasted very bitter, and its notorious burning could be equated to hot peppers .</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Stinging nettle could be used to prepare workman's balm , and, when mixed with aegwyrt , workman's poultice . Both topical curative substances were often used by the folk of the trade to aid them in their daily work.</p>
<p>When treated and prepared correctly, nettle plant could be used to create potions of minor healing .</p>
<p>Before the Time of Troubles , stinging nettle was a component of the repel vermin spell .</p>
<p>Nettle was a natural counter-agent to magical and mundane sleep . The plant's natural bitterness and burning irritation staved off the drowsiness and stopped the chewer from falling asleep, even though they still felt drowsy. The gnome Madarn Spiderhunter recommended it for those afflicted with sleep when they approached the tower of Gothyl in Spiderhaunt Wood , and gathered leaves in the forest for this purpose.</p>
<p>Golden Sands Gold brew was produced by fortifying regular Golden Sands lager with nettle and cactus extracts, giving its its titular color and notably bitter aftertaste.</p>
<p>Nettle was used by priests of Ilmater and Loviatar . One of the techniques used by the followers of Ilmater was stuffing their undergarments with nettle. Priestesses of Loviatar used nettle for self-flagellation.</p>
<p>Wild nettle grew on the Malatran Plateau in Kara-Tur where it was used to brew nettle beer or cooked down into nettle soup .</p>
