<p>Gallaher Brym was a scribe refugee from the Rivington neighborhood of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , as the armies of the Absolute ravaged the Western Heartlands , scribe Gallaher Brym and his family were among countless refugees seeking entrance to Baldur's Gate. The family was not allowed passage through the Wyrm's Crossing , forcing them to remain in Rivington's refugee tent city. Desperate for admission into the closed-off city, Gallaher penned a letter, sent via the Sword Coast Couriers , addressed to Lord Patriar Haverford Gist . The scribe offered his professional services for a mere nominal fee and eternal gratitude if Haverford, renowned for his charitability, would send to word to the Flaming Fists to allow the family enter the city. It was unknown whether Lord Gist responded to the request or even if the letter was ever delivered.</p>
