<p>Dragon's Rest was a monastery dedicated to Bahamut , the benevolent god of good dragonkind . It had a long and storied history, but remained in use by followers of the Platinum Dragon as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The monastery was built atop the cliffs along the northern stretch of Stormwreck Isle , a small landmass in the Sea of Swords just off the Sword Coast .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>It was constructed as a large, open-air temple set high atop the Stormwreck, along with several underground chambers carved within the cliff face overlooking the sea below.</p>
<p>A switchback pathway and ascending rocky stairs connected the various underground chambers, leading up to Bahamut's temple.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Going up from the beach of Stormwreck isle, along the monastery's walkway, the monastic cells became visible to all passersby. The six lowest celles included personal residences, in front of which stood a statue of the bronze dragon Astalagan . Further up the path were the monastery's kitchens and it's library, which housed numerous volumes primarily regarding theology and historical works.</p>
<p>Approximately 90 ft (27 m) above sea level lay the temple of Bahamut. While it too was partially carved out of Stormwreck's cliff face, the temple extended further out about 20 ft (6.1 m) outwards. Eight columns connected by adjoining archways surrounded a second draconic statue, this one of Bahamut himself.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>Visitors of Dragon's Rest were overcome with feelings of peace and tranquility.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The monastery was a site to which pilgrims traveled, in order to seek serenity, greater wisdom, and guidance in their life's path.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Dragon's Rest was protected by potent warding magic.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century, Bahamut's monastery was inhabited by a band of semi-intelligent, non-violent kobolds who devoted themselves to the tenets of Bahamut's faith. Notable among them were Agga , Blepp , Myla , and Zark , among others. Two humans took up residence within the temple: Tarak an enthusiastic botanist, and Varnoth , the retired leader of the Azure Wolves mercenary company.</p>
<p>The monastery was led by Elder Runara , a bronze dragon who often took the form of a human .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Grinning Halfling, 1481 DR , a group of five adventurers came to Dragon's Rest from the city of Neverwinter . They were ferried across by the scoundrel captain named Drauz the Dreg from the city's Blacklake District .</p>
<p>Elder Runara observed the adventurers with the hope they would prove trustworthy enough to retrieve her lost wyrmling Aidron from the disgruntled dragon Sparkrender .</p>
