<p>The Hassitor were an immeasurably ancient race that once inhabited the plane of Acheron . They commanded powerful necromantic magic and skills in stonemasonry, which they combined together to forge the most lasting of their creations, the hassitorium . Beyond these mobile fortresses, the only remnants of their civilization were monuments of bizarre architecture.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It wasn't quite clear when exactly the hassitor fell to extinction, but it roughly occurred when the baatezu were still a relatively young race within the multiverse .</p>
<p>Sometime in the 14 th century DR , a group of adventurers from Ravens Bluff visited the plane of Acheron. There they came upon the hassitorium Ishtavarek and its captain, Estrak Longtooth . When they inquired with the half-orc as to where they were, he told them the name of his hassitorium and of the race that had created these mobile fortresses.</p>
