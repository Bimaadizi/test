<p>In 1479 DR , Xuna took part in the Siege of Neverwinter . She fought against the same undead warrior that killed her father, and although she had the upper hand at first, eventually she was overpowered. She was rescued from certain death by the cleric Celeste . Xuna later joined forces with Celeste and Sergeant Knox to defeat the undead before meeting Valindra's army at the head of a force of Neverwinter's defenders.</p>
<p>Later, Xuna accompanied Elminster and the factions of the North to the Dragonbone Vale , where the allied forces sought to thwart a plot by the Cult of the Dragon . There, Xuna was put in charge of supply lines for the Shield of the North encampment.</p>
