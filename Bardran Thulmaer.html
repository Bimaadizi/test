<p>Shield Duke Bardran Thulmaer was the well-loved leader of the town of Alamontyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was an aging but large man with a huge white mustache. He ruled with a conservative fair style, preferring to consult local religious leaders before making political decisions. This made him well-loved not only with the people of Alamontyr but also the people of the Realm of the Smoking Star to the west.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The forty Griffon Knights were Bardran Thulmaer's personal guard and upholders of the peace in Alamontyr. Although the Shield Duke was popular with his people, he had not named a successor, leading to much speculation about who would succeed him.</p>
