<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the druid Halsin —in the form of a bear —and several adventurers attempted to infiltrate the Shattered Sanctum. They were caught by the Cult of the Absolute; while the adventurers managed to get away, Halsin the bear did not. The goblins imprisoned him in the dungeons deep within the Shattered Sanctum.</p>
