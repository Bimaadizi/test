<p>A groundhog , often called a woodchuck , was a small mammalian creature.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Groundhogs were able to gnaw through wood and trees at a quick rate. They were fairly common.</p>
<p>Woodchucks were somewhat dexterous and were good at hiding, moving silently, and listening. They also had a strong sense of smell.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>The little animals were of no threat to humans . Woodchuck pelts were worth about 1 gp each. They were sometimes used as familiars , particularly by gnomes . The red meat of such critters made up a large portion of the diet of aurumvoraxes .</p>
<p>On the continent of Faer√ªn , groundhogs were known to dwell in Cormanthor and Amn . In the Crowded Sea , sapient groundhogs lived on the island chain known as the Steaming Isles .</p>
<p>Beyond Toril , they could be found on the planet of Chandos .</p>
