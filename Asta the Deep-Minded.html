<p>Asta the Deep-Minded was an elder dwarf woman who followed Hal Stoutheart 's Tethyamar expedition in the 1480s DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Asta had dark eyes and a bob of white hair. She wore a fine dress and carried an ornate staff .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>In the best tradition of dwarven elders, Asta was suspicious, grumpy, and stubborn, and used this to help her kin. She immediately knew that Hal Stoutheart's promises were suspect, and remained unaffected by the influence of the jewels of ardor even as the expedition degenerated into chaos.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Asta arrived at the Tethyamar Mining Outpost when her own nephew Freygar Plumbline joined Hal Stoutheart's expedition. She immediately picked up how odd the situation was and how her fellow dwarves were turning into manic oddballs, and strongly suspected that something foul was afoot despite the general air of wealth and glory. When a group of opportunistic surfacers arrived at the outpost to get work, she roped them into helping the other dwarves stay alive and investigating the odd goings-on. Her benevolent scheme came to the aid of Freygar, Eluf the Steadfast , Hagen Silverthumb , Gunhild the Watchful , and finally Inger Ingersdottir as they ran into problems. Her suspicions were ultimately proven correct when it turned out that Hal Stoutheart was long-dead, and the expedition leader was none other than the demon lord Graz'zt , seeking the lure the dwarves to ruin by exploiting their own greed.</p>
