<p>Sonjar's Tower was a tower belonging to an Imaskari artificer , located inside a geode. As of 1372 DR , it was abandoned, the master of the tower long-dead.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The tower was located inside a geode in the shadows of the Giant's Belt mountains, on top of an earth node of great power.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The tower had marble floors and beautifully painted frescoes, which had grown worn with time, but unseen servant spells had kept it clean for millennia. It eschewed doors, using portals instead. One-way portals to the Elemental Planes of Air , Fire and Water served a number of functions inside the geode, renewing the air and providing heat and fresh water. Inside the tower, numerous portals carried food, refuse, and people; the top level included portals to other locations throughout the Imaskari Empire . Not all of the portals were stable by the 14 th century DR ; some of the portals required instructions to activate, which would only be accepted in Roushoum . Atop the tower entrance, a sign read "Sonjar, Artificer, Master of the Amethyst Tower".</p>
<p>A circular demiplane held the artificer's orchard. There was a room devoted to the torture of priests. Most books in the library became too brittle to handle. The forge room was in a malfunctioning extradimensional space, which dropped its contents periodically back into the artifice chamber. Notably, the artificer's trophy room included the preserved head of some angelic creature.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Though the master of the tower was gone for good, in 1372 DR a group of drow mercenaries called Durdyn's Devils had come to search the towers for Imaskari magic on behalf of House Vrasl . They hoped that such magic would help explain Lolth 's silence. A brown dragon had been hired as their guide. The only other inhabitants of the geode were undead , including four slaves, now spectres , and a curst slavemaster. All of them died during the rebellion of −2488 DR .</p>
