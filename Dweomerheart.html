<p>Dweomerheart was a Celestial plane in the World Tree cosmology model and was also the name of the scintillating city that was the realm of Mystra here in the World Tree model and on the plane of Elysium in the Great Wheel model . The other deities of magic, Azuth , Savras , and Velsharoon , also made their homes on this plane not far from Mystra's domain.</p>
<p>Dweomerheart was destroyed in a cataclysmic explosion in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , after Cyric assassinated Mystra causing the Spellplague . Though the deities of Dweomerheart largely perished, most of the faithful of Mystra, Azuth, and the other gods dwelling there were transported safely to the Fugue Plane where they were restored and re-assigned, many of them ending up either in Towers of Night , Gates of the Moon , or Kelemvor 's own City of Judgment .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This plane was mostly uninhabited mountain ranges, teeming with wildlife, with no known portals to the other planes of existence. The only way to access this plane other than traveling through the Astral was via branches of the World Tree itself, which connected to other Celestial planes.</p>
<p>The domains of the deities residing on this plane all occupied a single mountain with a flat top which was adorned with Mystra's shining city of magic, Dweomerheart. Dedicated to the appreciation and study of magic, especially to the creation of new magic, the city was the ultimate university for the Art . The city itself was the quintessence of alteration , powered by conjuration through evocation , all wrapped in illusions that changed daily. It was a high honor to be asked to exercise one's creativity in casting the glamors and redecorating the city for a day.</p>
<p>The domains of Azuth, Savras, and Velsharoon were all sets of caverns and caves beneath the high plateau.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Apart from the petitioners and the usual angels that served their deities, the only known inhabitants of this plane were the mysterious mercane looking for trading opportunities, and the inevitables : lawful constructs created to enforce the fundamental laws of the multiverse.</p>
