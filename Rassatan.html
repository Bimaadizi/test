<p>Rassatan was a city in Samarach , also known as The City of Gilded Pearls , found on Rassatan Bay , in the foothills of the Sanrach Mountains .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The city of Rassatan was situated on the steep cliffs of the bowl-shaped Rassatan Bay that gave the settlement its name. The city's docks were at the bottom of the cliff-encircled bay, below the rest of the city. The docks were separated from other parts of Rassatan by a single gate and a long well-patrolled tunnel that eventually led to a fortified gatehouse above the Sanrach Basin .</p>
<p>Most buildings and habitats in Rassatan were carved into the walls of the basin. A typical home was a burrow with its entrance on the city's terraced walls.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Rassatan's main export was the golden pearls of the highest quality in the entire Faerûn . The pearls were grown in the city's famed and abundant oyster beds at the bottom of Rassatan Bay.</p>
