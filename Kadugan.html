<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Kadugan was a lowly sailor and laborer who worked alongside Listless under Bosun Sharley , who worked her crew hard. Kadugan was tasked with unloading the boat but lamented the fact that Bosun did not land under one of the docks' unloading cranes, making unloading that much harder for Kadugan and Listless.</p>
