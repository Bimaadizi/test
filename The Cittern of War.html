<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Those bards who stung the instrument could summon emotion, courage twice per day, which made the companions of the bard stronger, quicker, more valorous, and unable to lose their morale in combat. This magical inspiration lasted for an entire hour.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Cittern of War was crafted by a halfling instrument maker Relias Blackseed before the Year of the Hunted Whale, 1013 DR and blessed by priests of Arvoreen the Defender. Relias' creation was not made to be used by the halfling himself, so the cittern was sold to the bard named Gallow Deely . He used the instrument to make music and songs capturing his adventuring companion's great deeds. One such group was the Company of Frozen Trees . Gallow used The Cittern of War to her them overcome a young green dragon in 1013 DR , the event immortalized in the rollicking tune called The Fight of Green Thirteen . Copies of such instruments were wielded in battle by both churches, of Tempus and Arvoreen . In the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , The Cittern of War ended up in the treasure hoard of white wyrms who inhabited the ice caverns of the Wyrm's Tooth Glacier on the Spine of the World and led by Frostbite .</p>
