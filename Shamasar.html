<p>Shamasar was a captain among the elite dragonborn guards maintained by the High Lady Ordalf of Sarifal in the Moonshae Isles prior to his betrayal and death in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Shamasar and his dragonborn troops were no ordinary soldiers: they used combinations of their breath weapons to control battlefields with fire and poison , and just a few of them were sufficient to stall an entire army.</p>
<p>He had draconic wings with a wingspan of 20 feet (6.1 meters), which he used to intimidate his foes.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was always polite and respectful to those whom he chose to serve, and was unafraid to sacrifice his life for them.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He fought with a greatsword in one hand and a warhammer in the other. He rode a dragonspawn mount .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 1460s DR, Shamasar was party to a plot by Valeanne to smuggle Princess Amaranth out of the Sarifal capital of Karador in order to protect her from the wrath of her half-sister, High Lady Ordalf. Shamasar brought five of his dragonborn soldiers with him on their pre-dawn ride to Crane Point , including Gesh and Haroon . Upon nearing their destination, they were attacked by a company of drow , and Shamasar and his underlings dutifully sacrificed themselves to buy Valeanne as much time as they could. Shamasar was torn from his mount by drow after sustaining many arrows and single-handedly cutting down two driders as they leapt onto him.</p>
<p>After his death, it was believed that Valeanne had bribed or otherwise compelled Shamasar and his guards to betray the High Lady.</p>
