<p>Golden ammonites were mysterious creatures who dwelt in the deepest parts of the ocean.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Golden ammonites were large mollusks with a brilliant gold shell. Their body within the shell, like all mollusks, was soft and vulnerable, and dark brown in color. They had two large eyes on flexible stalks and several flexible tentacles, each up to 12 ft (3.7 m) in length. Both the eye stalks and tentacles were hidden within the shell when not in use.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Golden ammonites were nearsighted but were capable of detecting heat and light sources up to 120 ft (37 m) away. It was capable of detecting motion and sounds in a radius of 600 ft (180 m), making it extremely difficult to surprise or sneak up on the mollusk. It was immune to charm, enchantment, psionic and telepathic-based effects and spells.</p>
<p>From their eyes, a golden ammonite had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of the light ball spell. Each eye could independently launch a brilliant ball of light, to a range of up to 90 ft (27 m).</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>In combat, golden ammonites used their long, powerful tentacles to grab onto an opponent within range. It began constricting its target, and sucker along the inside of the tentacles began draining the target's bodily fluids. If hurt, it immediately withdrew itself into its shell, remaining there until they were healed. Its shell was incredibly strong, and it was capable of self-healing any damage to it, with the most sever damage taking up to a year to regenerate.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Due to their natural habitat being so deep underwater, little was known about golden ammonites. It was unknown if they were sentient or mundane animals. Their society and language, if it existed, was equally unknown. It was speculated by some that their language may be based on sound or touch. What was known was that their thought process was so alien to humanoids that psionics , telepathy and telepathic spells such as ESP were useless. It was also known that they did not collect treasure from fallen opponents.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Golden ammonites lived in abyssal canyons and trenches far below the surface of Toril 's oceans.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Some acted as servants of the marid Kalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari in her Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls .</p>
<h3>Usages</h3>
<p>The shell of a golden ammonite was extremely valuable, with an intact shell selling for up to 80,000 gp at markets on the surface.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Juvenile golden ammonites have never been encountered, only mature specimens. Their lifespan was unknown but it was speculated to be up to several hundred years. Golden ammonites fed directly on the ocean floor, absorbing nutrients and minerals. Their body pulled gold from their digestive system and transferred it to their shell. Occasionally golden ammonites fed on the fallen carcass of another creature.</p>
