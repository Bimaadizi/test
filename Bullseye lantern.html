<p>A bullseye lantern was a type of lantern which focused the source of light to illuminate only in a specific direction.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like hooded lanterns , typical bullseye lanterns consisted of a metallic frame enclosing glass panels, within which a wick connected to a reservoir of oil burned and shed light as long as the supply of fuel lasted, typically 6 hours for 1 pint (470 milliliters) of oil. The difference was that a bullseye lantern was almost entirely covered in a reflective metal housing with only a single aperture (the "bullseye") which allowed light to escape, illuminating significantly farther than a hooded lantern, but only in a limited direction.</p>
