<p>The Street of Ser-Ukcal was a road in Myth Nantar leading south from the Fire Fountain at the city's centre, to the South Gate at its edge, and was the usual point of entry to the city for most visitors. It was paved with white stones, and had many arches overhead, which, as of 1369 DR, made it tricky to negotiate.</p>
