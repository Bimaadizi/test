<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the the mid–14 th century DR , Bonegnasher stumbled upon knowledge of a powerful artifact , an orb of dragonkind hidden somewhere deep inside the long ruined and abandoned castle of a once-powerful do-gooder wizard. The ogre led a group of marauders to take over the castle. They stayed for years searching for the lost artifact and capturing slaves. Bonegnasher's bandit band consisted of several cowardly goblins and kobolds , several hobgoblins , orcs , gnolls , , and a lizard man cleric of Semuanya . At various points in time, the marauders captured villages and travelers and used them as slaves within the castle walls, one of whom was Taran Goldenstar, an apprentice of Freedale's sage.</p>
<p>Capturing Taran ended up being the act that sealed the ogre's fate. The wizard Netheril hired a group of local adventurers to find the missing apprentice and help Taran recover the dangerous orb . The heroes were able to defeat the marauders and killed Bonegnasher and his pets. The heroes freed the captured slaves and Taran and recovered the hidden orb of dragonkind .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Rumors and hearsay obfuscated the history of the Tomb of Damara and Bonegnasher. Some claimed that the ogre and his forces attacked the castle and killed its inhabitants, which was false, as Damara was not killed in battle but mummified and interred. The folk of Freedale claimed that Bonegnasher and his bandits spent twenty years in the ruins looking for the orb .</p>
