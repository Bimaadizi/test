<p>The Kinslayer was a trident enchanted specifically to harm merfolk of Serôs .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The trident possessed a simple +1 enchantment to its damage, and it guided the wielder's hand toward the target. When wielded against other merfolk, the weapons effectively became a weapon of death – a powerful +4 enchanted trident. However, that power could only be accessed when the Kinslayer was wielded by a menfolk. Additionally, a merfolk wielder could cast pressure resistance and light spells using the Kinslayer thrice per day each.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , the Kinslayer was wielded by Ogmard , a merman of Voalidru in Serôs. Since the end of the Twelfth Serôs War , Ogmard considered the Kinslayer to be his most prized possession and the weapon used to slaughter members of the much-hated clan Homurr .</p>
