<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Mage's battle robes were enchanted to radiate low purple light at 32 feet (9.8 meters) distance. The magics that were weaved into these robes improved the wearer's concentration and spellcraft while granting increased magic resistance.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mage's battle robes were create by an obscure yet powerful wizard , Klaphen Fortier . Klaphen was tired of hearing about the greatness of archwizards like Elminster Aumar or Khelben Arunsun , and powerful arcane organizations such as the infamous Red Wizards of Thay . His creation aimed at bolstering young spellcasters' abilities who were willing to challenge more experienced wizards and make a name for themselves. It was widely rumored that Klaphen Fortier died in his tower when an unlikely accident rained fifty-six lightning bolts with a score of meteors on his lair.</p>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR, battle robes were coming across the Sword Coast and could be encountered in many cities including Neverwinter .</p>
