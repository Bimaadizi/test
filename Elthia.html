<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the early 7th century DR , Chessagol had recently come under the rule of King Lamoth and his newly royal family, though they were not considered legitimate. Lamoth sought to bolster the legitimacy of his line by marrying his children, Elthia among them, to royal families around the Inner Sea , often by sending them to visit their royal courts.</p>
<p>Finally, Lamoth successfully arranged a marriage between Elthia and Prince Bellodar III of Impiltur. Elthia went to Lyrabar in Impiltur, accompanied by her dowry, which included the sword Galathos .</p>
<p>Bellodar became king of Impiltur, and Elthia queen, in the Year of Sifting Sands, 642 DR . Galathos eventually became the traditional sword of the princes of Impiltur.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>Princess Elthia was the daughter of King Lamoth, who had five other daughters and eight sons. She married Bellodar III of Impiltur. Their children included Morus and Amarkos I .</p>
