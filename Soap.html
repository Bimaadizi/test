<p>The daily soaps from Selgaunt popular in the 14 th century DR came in 4 ounces (0.11 kilograms) bars of several varieties: plain lye for 1 cp , mild for 1 sp , and scented for 1 gp . There were many available scents, but most popular Sembian imported ones were Moonshae Spring , Elven Wild , Unicorn's Horn , and Shining Sea .</p>
