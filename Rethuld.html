<p>Rethuld of Saerloon was a Sembian merchant in Dalelands .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Rethuld was originally from Saerloon . Fearing the chaos that the Time of Troubles had unleashed in his country, and advised by a disguised malaugrym , he gathered some like-minded merchants and a mercenary escort and traveled to the Dalelands with the intent to seize a stronghold. Rethuld and his group met Storm Silverhand , Anastra Syluné Silverhand and the Rangers Three at the Standing Stone . Storm managed to convince Rethuld that he was deceived, but at this point the malaugrym killed the merchant from behind and escaped. Storm followed the monster while Syluné made an agreement with the remaining merchants.</p>
