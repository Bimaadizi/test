<p>The Twenty Stones of Thruun was an arrangement of standing stones found in the isolated fishing village of Dougan's Hole in Icewind Dale .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This landmark comprised a score of vertical granite menhirs , aligned in a triangle with three equal sides, with a single stone placed in the center.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The folks of Dougan's Hole maintained that the stones were arranged before their town was founded.</p>
<p>While no one knew the exact meaning of the word Thruun , some sages have connected it to mighty creature that lived in Icewind Dale in ages past, while others believed it was the name of a long-forgotten deity .</p>
<p>Around 1485 DR, the barbarian champion Isarr Kronenstrom summoned Thruun from the standing stones and sent it to attack Good Mead. The hairy creature was the size of a horse, with long arms and clawed hands. Its face resembled a wolf, but eyeless and with several sets of nostrils. The summoning process seemingly involves the severed hands of ten sacrificial victims (two hands each).</p>
