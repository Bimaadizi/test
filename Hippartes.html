<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hippartes first distinguished himself as a warrior in the war against Maerduuth .</p>
<p>However, afterward, his involvement in politics ended in disgrace, with him being banished from Akanax. For a time, he lived as an adventurer but when he learned that his city was close to losing a war with Soorenar , he gathered an army and joined the battle. Hippartes saved Akanax but the ruling council was on the verge of concluding a shameful peace treaty with Soorenar, so the soldiers rebelled and proclaimed Hippartes their king.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
