<p>The Purge Y没lash faction was a group of citizens in Y没lash around 1367 DR who favored the rule of Zhentil Keep over that of rival Hillsfar in their city.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>At 130 members, the faction was considerably less numerous in their supporters compared to their rival, perhaps because the Red Plumes of Hillsfar occupied the city in 1367 DR.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The faction sought vengeance in the form of political assassinations, sabotage, espionage, and open resistance against the soldiers of Hillsfar.</p>
