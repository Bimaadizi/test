<p>Bell-Breakers was a criminal organization, the muscle part of the Guild of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Absolute crisis of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the newly-risen Kingpin named Stone Lord , started a guild war against the Guild, strategically taking out the Guild's agents, kingpins, and taking over their territory. The Stone Lord was a thrall of the Cult of the Absolute , and as a part of the guild war, his men targeted gangs and smaller organizations under the Guild's rule. Bell-Breakers were among those hit by Stone Lord's men, however, their fate was unconfirmed. The Guild tasked Fruward the Nail with investigation shortly before the Zhentarim attempted to take over the Guild's operations in Baldur's Gate.</p>
<p>Fruward's report was a letter attesting to the Bell-Breakers' demise. The group and the belfry it was nesting in atop a temple in Heapside were obliterated by the Stone Lord.</p>
