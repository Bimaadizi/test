<p>The Bloodstone Runehammers , also referred to simply as the Runehammers , were a group of dwarven warriors dedicated to protecting the dwarfholds of the Kingdom of Bloodstone in the 15 th century DR , although their oath survived the fall of that realm.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Runehammers were sworn to defend the various dwarven clans and holds of the Bloodstone Lands from monsters and other incursions. They were professional fighters and warlords known for their perceptiveness and dungeoneering skills.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Runehammers' duty became increasingly taxing following the overthrow of Bloodstone by the Warlock Knights of Vaasa , and in particular the Knights' subsequent assault on Hillsafar Hall and expulsion of Clan Orothiar from Bloodstone Mines in the Year of the Second Circle, 1470 DR .</p>
<p>Despite opposing the Warlock Knights, the Runehammers remained active in Vaasa. As of the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR , the Runehammers were party to a plot between Clan Hillsafar and Clan Orothiar to reclaim Bloodstone Mines.</p>
