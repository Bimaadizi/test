<p>Thokk was a half-orcish slave captured by Chieftain Saslick 's lizardfolk in 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Thokk was an unusually large half-orc with grayish skin. He was content with wearing filthy rags. He enjoyed violence and grinned savagely when allowed to rip an opponent apart by his lizard slavers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thokk was captured by Saslick's lizard tribe sometime in or before 1372 DR. Unlike other slaves, the half-orc enjoyed being unleashed on a small makeshift gladiatorial arena, armed with a simple club. Observers often compared his attitude and grinning to that of a hungry wild dog . In 1372 DR, the Hero of Daggerford infiltrated the lizardfolk tribe wearing a magical disguise. The adventurer witnessed a cruel and unfair gladiatorial battle between giant orc-of-a-man Thokk and a petite elf woman Lenaia . Thokk's fate remained unknown, whether he was slain in the ring, released along with other slaves by the Hero of Daggerford, or left in the scaly hands of his capturers.</p>
