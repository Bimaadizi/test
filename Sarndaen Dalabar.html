<h2>Personality</h2>

<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Besides being amongst the most puissant magisters, Sarndaen Dalabar was an excellent actor.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before his challenge of Meldryn Jalensifer , Sarndaen Dalabar had been the apprentice to three wizardly masters in Athkatla , all of which eventually embroiled themselves in mercantile intrigues that became their undoing. After his challenge, he spent a few days in Meldryn Jalensifer's company, prior to finally slaying him with three meteor swarms .</p>
<p>Once the Magister , he worked to keep the most powerful mages opposed to each other, so they wouldn't turn their attention to him; he fulfilled his task to spread magic by giving magic to a few promising apprentices and calling on them to spread magic on his behalf. Then he, personally, devoted himself to exploring and making a map of all the gates he came across. Besides filling up books, he created the Opener's map , in a castle within the Ice Mountains ; his work was cut short when he died in an avalanche after crossing through an unrecorded portal .</p>
