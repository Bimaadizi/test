<p>Doorknocker was an enchanted bludgeon once wielded by an explorer named Pasi sometime before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This club possessed magics that dealt additional bludgeoning damage to its targets and discharged a knock spell onto locked objects when struck against them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Doorknocker accompanied its mistress, the tiefling adventurer Pasi, into dangerous treasure-hunting delves to Tier Lathadun‎ where its magic came in handy dispatching undead monsters and opening ancient locked doors. Some years before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Pasi met her doom in Tier Lathadun‎ after she slipped and plummeted to her death. Her body and the weapon were thought to be lost, until Doorknocker reappeared within a chest in Umgatlik's shrine on the Crab's Claw Coast in 1372 DR, which was being excavated by a group of Waterdhavian archeologists.</p>
