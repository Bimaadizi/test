<p>The Cairn of Moonlight was a burial mound where the Moonlight Men who fell in the Battle of Turnstone Pass were interred.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The mass grave contained the remains and treasures of around 200 men, the total of the Moonlight Men's numbers save six. The site of the stone barrow was marked by a near-round hole in a rock formation that, on nights of the full moon and only when viewed from the right angle, was illuminated by moonlight.</p>
<p>The cairn contained many magical items , buried next to their former owners, including one amulet of leadership , the griffonlance of goring , two horns of blasting , one horn of valor , Nimoar's blazing bulwark , one ring of armoring , the silverhelm of the Guardian , one staff of thunder and lightning , one talisman of memorization , and possibly the starstaff of Tsaelynos .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Keeper of the Vault of the Sages who annotated the Moonlight Paean , which was written by one of the six survivors , believed that a clue as to the location of the cairn was left in the ballad's refrain. The clause "leaving no stone unturned" was believed to serve a dual meaning, referring both to the fact that the Moonlight Men had been successful treasure hunters in the valley before the battle and to the location of the battle and the site of their burial. The Keeper balanced the theory, however, with the statement that more than twenty treasure hunters had since tried to find the burial site and failed.</p>
<p>In fact, the Keeper's theory was true; the Cairn of Moonlight was indeed located somewhere in the valley of Turnstone Pass , in the Nether Mountains . However, it was even more difficult to find than it ever was after the great treant Turlang and his galeb duhr allies caused an avalanche in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , which not only blocked the pass but covered the cairn and its marking stones with tons of rock.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Immediately after the Battle of Turnstone Pass, Mintiper Moonsilver and his five other surviving companions buried their friends and fellow mercenaries in a hidden location within the valley and erected its stones.</p>
