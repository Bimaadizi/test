<p>Winn's Ice House was an icehouse business in the city of Ravens Bluff owned by the wizard Darra Winn .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This building was located on the corner of Black Visor Street and Flask Circle , in the Anvil neighborhood of the Crow's End district.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Much like the business's prior home, a series of cool subterannean caverns beneath the building were used for the storing of its ice.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>This business created and stored ice through the use of spells , which it then sold. Most of this ice was cut during the winter season and stored in its underground caverns, packed compactly into casks specially made by a local cooper to be insulated with sawdust .</p>
<p>The store made most of its profit by supplying ice to elite inns, restauraunts, noble households, and private clubs, and the offices maintained by the city's knightly orders. Having contracts with many of them to deliver ice to their doors each morning. Winn's Ice House also provided ice in bulk to various fishmongers in the city. They delivered ice by means of wagons full of sawdust and hay.</p>
<p>A side business of Winn's Ice House during the hotter months was to sell flavored versions of its chipped ice, which had been chipped through use of the shatter spell. These cost two copper pieces , plus a three copper deposit for the returnable, earthenware cups and spoons they were served in. The treat was popular among both children and halflings in the city.</p>
<h2>History</h2>

<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In the 14 th century DR , this establishment was run by Darra Winn and her three daughters.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Much like their prior establishment, Winn's Ice House was the victim of some local rumors. In the case of this establishment, there were rumors that its underground caverns were occasionally used to keep cool things besides ice, such as bodies awaiting staged "deaths."</p>
