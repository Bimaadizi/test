<p>Angah Lalla was a curios dealer and fence for stolen goods in the city of Scornubel .</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>Angah dressed in flowing off-white robes with a black veil. He wore a large gold rune-engraved amulet of protection +2 around his neck. His long black hair was braided and tied with off-white cloth. He spoke in a hoarse whisper.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>There were rumours that Angah was from the lands east of Thay and Rashemen or Zhakar , mostly perpetuated by his dress sense and his reluctance to show his face.</p>
<p>Angah was actually a character invented by a married couple, Aareem and Leila , who came to Scornubel from Sembia after angering a powerful prince. One half of the team was usually out collecting information while the other stayed behind in the shop. Aareem and Leila were both in their forties with a teenaged daughter named Ezther , who also began assuming the guise of Angah.</p>
<h2>Shop</h2>
<p>Angah's shop was near the center of Scornubel and appeared large from the outside, but it was dimly lit with maze-like shelving arrangements within. The contents of the shop consisted of weapons, books, scrolls, armor, and other knick-knacks. There was a thick smell of incense inside. A hidden door operated within the shop.</p>
