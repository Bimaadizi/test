<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>It was run by Entharl Danthelon , the shield dwarf proprietor who claimed to be a retired adventurer. Circa the late 15 th century DR , Danthelon employed a duo of half-orcish bodyguardsâ€“ Somi and his brother. Secretly, Entharl Danthelon offered his shop's cellar to the local Harper cell to be used a safehouse and the bodyguards ensured no city guard nor steel watcher bothered the "guests." The High Harper Jaheira was one of the agents who used the safehouse and was well accounted with the Dancing Axe's proprietor.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The shop earned its name from a "magically-floating axe " that protected the premises at night. According to Danthelon himself, the axe was a gift from a particularly grateful elven princess.</p>
<p>In fact, the "axe" was actually a tamed stirge that had been modified with illusion -magic by Yssra.</p>
