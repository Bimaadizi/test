<p>Referred to as the mysterious drow or the Bregan D'aerthe Operative , an unnamed drow of the Bregan D'aerthe mercenary organization was active in Neverwinter in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He recruited fellow drow to help him foil the efforts of House Xorlarrin in undermining the rebuilding of Neverwinter, telling them that, if nothing else, it was for the good of Neverwinter. He declined to say what was in it for him or Bregan D'aerthe, however. He could usually be found somewhere propped up against a wall, loitering, and possibly even lurking.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the Siege of Neverwinter in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , this drow went to the Blacklake District and hired a drow adventurer to raid a Nashers -held house and kill a Xorlarrin agent who was meeting with them to provide magical weapons and equipment.</p>
<p>He later learned of a Xorlarrin spy working with the Blackdagger Bandits , again to provide magical weapons and aid but this time with the deal already done. While he stayed at the Broken Crown inn, he had the drow adventurer go to the Raven Cliff Beach to disrupt the delivery and destroy the weapons, to make it seem as if the Xorlarrin had double-crossed them. Afterward, the Xorlarrin spy came out of hiding to meet with the Blackdaggers to repair relations, just as the operative planned. He sent the adventurer to slay the spy and her contacts in the abandoned mineshaft they met in.</p>
