<p>Buckley's buckler was a target shield that was made of mammoth hide.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The buckler, which was awfully tanned, smelled of decay. Not even the most powerful substances could get rid of the stench.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>As well as providing more defense, the shield seemed to fortify the wielder, making them more vigorous.</p>
