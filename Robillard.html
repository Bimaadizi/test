<p>Robillard was a wizard of the Sword Coast in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . He was a close ally of Captain Deudermont who served as the second-in-command on Deudermont's vessel, the Sea Sprite . He was a former member of the Arcane Brotherhood .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He aided Deudermont after an assassination attempt in the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR , an act that helped save the life of Wulfgar , the accused killer. Had Deudermont not woken, Wulfgar would have been falsely executed for the alleged assassination attempt, a crime that Deudermont confirmed he did not commit.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Haunting, 1377 DR , Robillard single-handedly defeated Arklem Greeth , a lich and the former Archmage Arcane of the Arcane Brotherhood. This battle, however, pulled the wizard from his captain's side, allowing High Captain Kensidan of Luskan to bait and kill Captain Deudermont.</p>
