<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Circa 1357 DR , the process of brewing an oil of agelessness was a closely guarded secret of the priestesses of Ishtar , highly sought after by those who dabbled in southern magic . The only ingredient of the oils that was known to outsiders was nectar from roses cultivated in the gardens of Isthar in Unther.</p>
