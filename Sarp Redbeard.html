<p>Sarp Redbeard was the lord of the city of Wheloon in Cormyr in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Sarp Redbeard was famously the most headstrong of the local lords of Cormyr, but he mellowed somewhat with age. He had a reputation for bluster.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Sarp Redbeard was the Lord of Wheloon, ruling in the name of King Azoun IV . However, he often disagreed with the crown's policies, usually refusing to support those that did not benefit Wheloon, though he never tried to cause dissension. The other lords understood his single-minded dedication to Wheloon and just outvoted him when they had to, while Redbeard didn't vote against others unless the matter concerned Wheloon. Hence he acted virtually independently of the crown. By 1374 DR, Redbeard had softened his stance and demonstrated his loyalty to the crown, and showed unwavering support in trade and military matters. He was still focused on the good of Wheloon.</p>
<p>In addition, Redbeard governed and represented neighboring communities that were too small to have their own lord, such Hultail , Ghars (over 60 miles (97 kilometers) away), and Thunderstone , at least as well as he could from a distance.</p>
<p>Redbeard kept poor records of the population of Wheloon and the other lands he governed, so the taxes he paid to the crown fluctuated. Redbeard did not skim money for himself, he was simply a poor bookkeeper. This made him a regular annoyance to Baron Thomdor , who oversaw tax collections, but he trusted Redbeard's honorable intentions. Still, Redbeard was generally negligent on taxation, and he tended to overlook the contribution of smugglers to the local economy.</p>
<p>Redbeard was also the owner of Redbeard Rental Storage and Shipping , a warehouse facility in Wheloon. It was a high-quality facility and a wisely invested and operated business.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Redbeard's independent attitudes, disagreements with court policies, and Wheloon-focused voting won him few allies in court, and he was not well liked there. But, by the same token, Redbeard was popular and well-liked by his people, who felt he kept the Purple Dragons from meddling in their affairs too much, and by the many farmers who dwelled in his domain, as he often sided with them. The Whelunians respected his focus on them and their city.</p>
<p>Redbeard sometimes disagreed with Constal Maximanus Tholl , captain of the local Purple Dragons contingent, over what was best for Wheloon. Tholl opposed Redbeard for his negligent taxation and lenience on smuggling, but he usually conceded with little complaint.</p>
<p>Elaerue Estspirit , the Herald for Wheloon, served as Redbeard's assistant, clerk, and record-keeper. She held the position by 1357 DR, and still held it ten years later. Up to 1367 DR, Sarp dealt with the king's envoy Grodoveth , who exchanged news and reports between him and Azoun.</p>
<p>Redbeard had an agreement with Anthara Shalymarr , proprietress of the Scarlet Sheath , that patrons would not be held responsible for things said while in her tavern. This served as a useful outlet for locals to vent their feelings and for illicit dealings.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Lord Sarp Redbeard dwelled in Oldstone Hall , the grandest manor house in Wheloon. It was surrounded by a paddock that also belonged to him, and sat in the center of town.</p>
<p>He owned the Redbeard Rental Storage and Shipping warehouse facility in Wheloon, on the west bank of the Wyvernflow .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sarp Redbeard was known for being headstrong while still a youth, and he remained the same into adulthood.</p>
<p>He was lord of Wheloon by 1357 DR . By this time, he'd already made his reputation for being headstrong and independent, and disagreed with crown policy on several issues, while also earning his popularity.</p>
<p>During the Time of Troubles in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Kelemvor , Midnight , and Adon visited Wheloon as they passed through Cormyr, but Cyric 's Zhentilar agents framed Kelemvor for the robbery and murder of a local merchant. Cyric's agent testified to Lord Redbeard that they had seen him leave the house with a bloody sword. The Wheloon Watch detained the group, with its captain expecting that the lord would pronounce swift execution as there was little doubt. The group fled on stolen horses just as Redbeard arrived; he ordered the Watch and the Purple Dragons to pursue, but they made a successful getaway.</p>
<p>In the 1360s, Lord Redbeard was petitioned by the people of Thunderstone to reprimand Oversword Faril Laheralson , commander of the Purple Dragons stationed there, over the behavior of his troops. Redbeard spoke to Laheralson about the Purple Dragons's poor conduct, but was unable to push forward, as the oversword had the favor of King Azoun IV.</p>
<p>Following a number of hot-tempered interviews with Redbeard and some War Wizards , Shanna Northgate apparently retired from life as a fence and smuggler, prior to 1367 DR. Redbeard had also reprimanded Roond Asmyrk , proprietor of the Silvery Sembian Snail , over drunken parties spilling into neighboring areas and farmlands.</p>
<p>Sarp Redbeard was an aging man by 1374 DR , but still governing Wheloon. He'd softened his ways by this time, and demonstrated his loyalty to the Cormyrean crown, thanks to his unwavering support in trade and military matters. However, his main focus was still on the good of Wheloon.</p>
<p>Around Ches of that year, the priestess Naedaenya Arthas met with Sarp Redbeard to request permission to construct a temple of Mystra in Wheloon. She argued that it would open a market for magical items , spell components , and lore, and boost the city's economy. She also paid hefty bribes. He gave his approval and granted the priests tax breaks. He told Whelunians it would bring in more people and trade, and make Wheloon important. When, on Eleint 6 , adventurers in the service of Mystra discovered Sharran cultists operating in the temple instead, the Purple Dragons investigated the matter. Constal Maximanus Tholl brought the adventurers to an audience with Lord Redbeard, who requested they continue their investigations and follow the cultists into the Vast Swamp . Redbeard, Tholl, and the Purple Dragons remained in Wheloon to guard the city and the temple.</p>
