<p>Mouse Alley was a short, curving minor avenue of hard-packed earth and gravel in the Southern Ward of Waterdeep , that was considered a sacred site to those who worshiped the goddess Mystra .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This curving road linked the street of Blackcloak Alley to Brian's Street . East of it, the street Fishwife Alley ran roughly parallel.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>An alleged event prior to the 13 th century DR was the origin of both this alleyway's name and its status as a sacred site. The story went that Ahghairon , the first Open Lord of Waterdeep, was one day chasing a mouse down this alley that he believed to be a shapechanged sorceress . After catching the mouse, it transformed before Ahghairon and revealed itself to be the goddess Mystra.</p>
<p>Years later a prideful wizard by the name of Thunturn came to this alley with the intent of challengeing Mystra for mastery over all magic . The goddess answered his challenge and left him humbled, his hair jet black from fright and his magic all stripped away.</p>
<p>In the 14 th century DR, Ruufdeidel Ressatar could usually be found lounging against a wall in this alley, waiting for someone to hire him for his informant services.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>It was said that worshipers of Mystra might receive aid from her in this alley or that she would punish anyone trying to harm her faithful that took refuge in the alley.</p>
