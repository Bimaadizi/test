<p>Blades Injurious was the name given to a unique gem -studded bracer of flying daggers owned by Jarlaxle Baenre in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The ornate design and many gems of the Blades Injurious meant it matched Jarlaxle's more exquisite and resplendent outfits. In truth, each gem and ornament worked into the bracer was a reminder of a secret, a promise, or a debt that kept the High Captains of Luskan under Jarlaxle's thumb.</p>
