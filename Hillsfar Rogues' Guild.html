<p>The Rogues' Guild of Hillsfar was ran by a man named Swipe around 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Rogues' Guild used a condemned former charnel house used to store plague victims as their headquarters. The building was located in the northwest section of Hillsfar. The guild outfitted the rooms inside of the structure with all manner of traps and pitfalls. At least eight guards were present at any time to alert others to intruders by use of a wooden whistle that made a chattering noise that sounded like a rat.</p>
<p>The guild actually operated out of a complex that lay beneath the building.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Rogues' Guild worked closely with the Red Plumes , serving as both eyes and ears for Maalthiir in his city.</p>
