<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gonijo became emperor in 1352 DR when his father Gokammu retired. His life was completely directed by counselors of the Takenaka clan and the Hojo clan . He only needed to sign the edicts made by the counselors and perform the traditional rituals to ensure the welfare of the state.</p>

<p>Gonijo cared nothing for the state's affairs. He would gladly resign and enter a monastery but he did not yet have an heir, so this was an impossible dream for the time being.</p>
