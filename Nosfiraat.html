<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nosfiraat was a vampire assassin from the land of Zakhara. He was employed by one of the region's Sultans. After a successful assassination of the Sultan's rival noble, Nosfiraat was to be disposed of in fear of him being captured and tortured to find incriminating information on the Sultan. The vampire was provided with a ship and crew and was ordered to leave Zakhara forever.</p>
<p>Nosfiraat's ship set sail to the Sword Coast . The ship was wrecked on the treacherous Blade Cliffs during a storm with all its crew perishing, and Nosfiraat survived thanks to being undead. The vampire claimed that all the bodies still left on the wreck were dragged away by hungry wolves. Soon after the storm's passing a traveling cleric discovered the sleeping vampire and trapped the undead inside.</p>
<p>In 1372 DR a group of adventurers investigating the Zhentarim plot against Daggerford stumbled across long-abandoned ship wreckage in the Blade Cliffs region to the west from Liam's Hold . Inside they found Nosfiraat desperate for their help.</p>
<p>He asked the adventurers to free him from the mystic prison inside the shipwreck swearing an oath not to harm his rescuers. He was restrained by three ritual stones around the cite. All they needed to do was to destroy the stones in exchange for precious Zakharan trinkets.</p>
