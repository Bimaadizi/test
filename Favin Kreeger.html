<p>Favin Kreeger ( pronounced : /ˈ f eɪ v ɪ n ˈ k r i g ɜːr / FAY-vin KREE-gur ) was an albino dwarf who resided in Port Nyanzaru 's Old City as of the late 15 th century DR . He made a living by hiding corpses in the city's refuse pit .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Favin dressed in rags and would sweat profusely when he exerted himself. He was surprisingly nimble.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Favin was a compulsive liar and a nervous, sniveling coward. He was quick to whine in the face of discomfort and to grovel in the face of intimidation. He had no loyalties, even to family, and cared only for his own self-preservation and comfort. While he was a criminal, he was not a killer and lacked the courage to engage in fighting.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He offered his body-hiding services to the criminals of Port Nyanzaru, and charged a hefty fee to make the corpses of murder victims disappear. He was also not above accepting odd jobs from suspicious individuals.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Shortly after the end of the death curse in the late 15 th century DR, Favin crossed paths with an undead necromancer , Jaru Tasca , while hiding a Chultan man's body in the refuse pit. She offered him 50 gold pieces to deliver a letter to the beggar prince Pock-Marked Po , and threatened to kill him if he revealed anything about her identity. He accepted the job in part out of fear, and unbeknownst to him, the letter was intended to push Po to send adventurers into a trap.</p>
<p>Upon delivering the letter, Po was concerned that neither he nor his contacts recognized the letter's handwriting, and when Favin refused to divulge who had given him the letter, Po had the dwarf thrown into Executioner's Run to scare him into speaking. This worked, and Favin revealed what he knew—including the location of the secret tunnel from which he had seen Jaru emerge—and hoped that adventurers would slay the necromancer to ensure his safety.</p>
