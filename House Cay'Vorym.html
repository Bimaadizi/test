<p>House Cay'Vorym was a notable Lolthite drow house of the city of Sschindylryn in the 15 th century DR . They had a particular interest in gladiatorial combat, gambling, and entertainment.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Cay'Vorym preferred not to get directly involved in risky activities. They operated the Cay'Vorym Fighting Pit and Underdark Arena near Sschindylryn, where they managed gladiatorial combat bouts between professional contestants, prisoners, and wild beasts.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Darkening in the mid-1480s DR, House Cay'Vorym mostly stayed out of the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar led by other houses, with the exception of raids upon the dryadic Great Tree . The drow assault allowed the mass capture of surfacers from Cormyr, and while many were handled as slaves by House Avithoul some ended up in the hands of Cay'Vorym. These Purple Dragons , War Wizards , and other folk were given the fate of fighting in the Cay'Vorym arenas for the entertainment of their customers.</p>
<p>Although their involvement was less obvious than that of Avithoul , Szind , and Dun'Robar , Cay'Vorym and their abuse of Cormyrean prisoners was discerned by the scholar Sorina Parnock . She sent a team to their secret fighting pits in the Underdark near Sschindylryn with the mission of rescuing any Purple Dragons there and dismantling the whole operation. On arrival, the Cay'Vorym guards and agents regarded the surfacers with a mixture of curiosity and professionalism, treating them more as customers than a threat. However, the master of the arena Feryl Cay'Vorym simply dumped the captives and rescuers into the pit, forcing them to fight against various threats for the entertainment of the crowd. Things went awry when Feryl's attempts at attracting purple worms drew up the massive and unmanageable worm Sineater , which tore apart the arena, devoured most of the paying customers in the crowd, and then ate both Feryl and the surfacers. After a fraught battle in the worm's guts, the surfacers eventually cut their way out with Feryl's special blade earthcarver and slew it, though not after it had thoroughly demolished the Cay'Vorym business and fulfilled the Cormyrean objectives for them.</p>
