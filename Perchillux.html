<p>Perchillux was an imp in Avernus , first layer of the Nine Hells , in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the city of Elturel was transported to Avernus in the Year of Twelve Warnings, 1494 DR , Perchillux roamed the streets looking to buy the souls of hapless citizens. He discovered the halfling baker Pilster Pebblehuck in an alleyway and offered him a deal: enough food for a month for his family in exchange for his very soul. Desperate, Pilster considered signing but adventurers might have intervened then, possibly determining the contract to be a trap that would have given Perchillux not just Pilster's soul, but those of all his family, and slaying or scaring the imp off.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Perchillux presented Pilster with a densely written and convoluted contract printed on parchment made from halfling skin.</p>
<p>He possessed a soul coin from a former trade.</p>
