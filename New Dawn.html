<p>New Dawn was the name chosen for a proposed village, farming community, and temple of Lathander in the Hindhorn Hills , northwest of Secomber in the early 1370s DR.</p>
<p>Due to the roaming wolves , gnolls , and orcs in the area, an offer of two dragons per day was made for anyone defending the project when it began. Its spokesperson was Harammas Malark .</p>
