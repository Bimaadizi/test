<p>The Great Imphras River was a system of three rivers found in Damara and Impiltur .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Great Imphras River flowed south from Lake Mogador in central Damara, joined with its first major tributary, the Sidewinder River , before leaving Damara, and then in Impiltur it merged with the River Icehilt and its second major tributary, the River Lench , before emptying into Traders Bay and the Easting Reach beyond.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , the river had rough sections of dangerous white water that made it ill-suited to all but the most daring or desperate of merchants. However, by the 1370s DR the river was commonly used as a shipping route all the way from the Easting Reach up to Lake Mogador and the port of Heliogabalus .</p>
