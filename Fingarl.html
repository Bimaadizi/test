<p>Fingarl was a wealthy merchant of Alaghôn in Turmish in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He owned a sizeable fleet of ships, on the profits of which he grew rich and fat.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Though pleased with his prosperity, Fingarl was a vain man, given to much preening, bragging, and boasting. He was also more than a little lecherous.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Notably, he was the owner of the great ruby known as Fingarl's Flame . He valued it highly; Fingarl was said to talk to the ruby and stroke it, particularly when he was upset about something.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This ruby was once found in the heart of Chult before it was transported out of the jungles by Fingarl's agents. At great expense, he had it enchanted by mages to produce light, to fly and follow him everywhere, and, as a security measure, to become incredibly hot and emit a deafening scream when moved over 200 yards (180 meters) from its owner, specifically, "from the eyes of Fingarl". This last enchantment was placed by the wizard Thalaskos and was a secret known only to him, Fingarl, and a half-dozen of the merchant's trusted agents.</p>
<p>Finally, Fingarl was found in his office one day, with both his ruby and his head missing! Thalaskos supposed the thief had learned of the security measure somehow and taken the merchant's head to circumvent it. Both remained missing as of around 1360 DR .</p>
