<p>Pixie breed horses were a cross-breed of fey and equine from the Blade Kingdoms of the Vilhon Reach .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Pixie horses were a quick and nervous breed, easily distinguished from other horses by their two feathery antennae that grew up from their brows.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Along with the huge metallic Gens D'Or , pixie horses were breeds only seen in the city-states of the Blade Kingdoms. Circa the Year of the Falling Moon, 1217 DR , these creatures were used by heralds of the city-state of Sumbria . One such herald was sent to negotiate peace following the disastrous battle in the Valley of Umbricci in the early fall. The herald was murdered by the conniving Colletrans under the rule of their new Prince-elect Ugo Svar√©zi .</p>
