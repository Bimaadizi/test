<p>The Speckled Worthog Inn was a fairly hospitable inn located somewhere along the Coast Road in the Vast in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The inn's front windows were composed of stained glass, too opaque to see through. Hung over its front door was a weathered sign depicting a warthog with red spots that had faded over time. Behind the establishment stood a large barn for patron to stable their mounts .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The inn was made up of five rooms. There was a common room full of tables and a fireplace, a kitchen, a large bar area, and two rooms restricted to the owner and staff.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The Speckled Worthog catered to a number of Vastian farmers, such as those from the nearby village of Farmersville .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The inn charged a single silver piece for a night in their common room or a single gold piece for one of their more private rooms, which could fit up to three individuals, as well as two copper pieces for use of their stables. In terms of refreshments the Speckled Worthog offered an aromatic beef stew for 4 cp, cheap ale for 5 cp, good ale for 1 sp, and a glass of elven wine for 2 sp.</p>
<p>The inn also sold some basic equipment for adventurers , including horses at a price of 3 cp.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in the late 14 th century DR, a few days after the Andonian Games , a group of adventurers from the city of Ravens Bluff were traveling the Coast Road to Tantras in search of Discount Merlin , a charlatan salesman of faulty magical items that the City Guard wanted brought to justice. Several hours after they had left Ravens Bluff, around the time of sunset , the adventurers came across the Speckled Worthog and decided to stay the night. At that time the bard Tangis Strongnote was staying at the inn, delighting patrons with songs and the strumming of his lyre .</p>
<p>The adventurers inquired about Discount Merlin with Tangis, the Speckled Worthog's staff, a dwarf traveler named Milo Finglerock , and a cleric of Moradin named Sophia Rockjumper . While there they learned that a gnome had visited the inn two days prior, hocking magical items, but did not match Merlin's description. He tried to interest Tangis in a magical lyre and managed to convince the proprietor to trade a couple bottles of elven wine for a rope of entanglement . Much like the items he had sold back in Ravens Bluff, the rope had since lost its enchantment.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Speckled Worthog was owned and operated by Nivla Worthog , a very loquacious individual who was quick to offer his patrons a meal or refill of a drink. He lived at the inn along with his daughter, Rose Worthog , who worked the kitchen, and her husband Milgelis .</p>
