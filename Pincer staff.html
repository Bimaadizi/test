<p>Pincer staffs were a type of specialized polearm unique to the kuo-toa that were designed to ensnare opponents, similar in design and principle to mancatchers . They were typically used by kuo-toan priests , otherwise known as "whips", including the specialized Sea Mother whips , though they also saw occasional use by kuo-toa fighters .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These polarms had a reach of 5​ to ​10 feet (1.5​ to ​3 meters) and required two hands to wield them properly. Over two-thirds of their reach was taken up by the polearm's shaft, with the rest taken up by the "pincer", which often measured 3 feet (0.91 meters) in length. On average they weighed about 20 lb (9,100 g).</p>
<p>Their namesake pincers could grapple creatures within the demihuman size range, going as large as a gnoll .</p>
