<p>Tam was a moody creature and terrified the drow who were providing her with meat.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before 1370 DR , the red dragon Tam was convinced to join forces with Azurna. She made a lair in a vast domed hall in Azurna's drow stronghold alongside her several hatchlings. The red wyrmlings were trained by drow to become their most powerful weapon against the City of Splendors. Sirian Flametongue was one of the young red dragons spawned by Tam and who willingly joined with Azurna's forces only to be slain by Khelbenite in Eleint of 1370 DR.</p>
