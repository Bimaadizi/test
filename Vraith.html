<p>Vraith was a wood elf female and a commander in the Order of Blue Flame located in the city of Ormpetarr . She held the rank of Accordant . She possessed a spellscar . Vraith was inspired through visions sent by the Sharn to attempt to enlarge the Plaguewrought Land around Ormpetarr through the Ritual of the Border . She was convinced that she would be able to join with the Sharn if she pleased them by unleashing the spellplague .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>She was born in 1345 DR in the Chondalwood . In 1385 DR , the Spellplague appeared in her dormitory room at the wizard academy and touched her, forming the spellscar on her chest.</p>
<p>Vraith devised a ritual to extend the border of the Plaguewrought Land. She convinced Brother Gregor that she intended to find a way to capture rogue areas of spellplague that remained in Faerûn and enlisted Gregor to create a potion that partially blocked the effects of the spellplague, which would allow pilgrim volunteers to survive long enough to complete the ritual.</p>
<p>When Vraith learned that Duvan was immune to the spellplague, she ordered him captured and experimented on. Duvan later escaped with the help of Slanya . During the Festival of Blue Fire in 1479 DR , Vraith recruited hundreds of pilgrims for the Ritual of the Border. Duvan returned with Tyrangal and Slanya and disrupted the ritual, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of pilgrims and caused Vraith's soul to merge with the magical border of the Plaguewrought Land. In 1479 DR , she wove her spirit into the Plaguewrought Land and was trapped and lost forever in a fate worse than death.</p>
