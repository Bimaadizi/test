<p>Achiko was the son of a noble of Aru Province in Wa in the 1700s on the Wa Calendar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the summer of Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR) , the 25-year-old Achiko spent an evening at a drinking house in Aru , where he was preyed upon by three former bushi turned to crime. Their favorite tactic was feigning revelry, befriending wealthy men in drinking houses and getting them very drunk, while only pretending to be drunk themselves, before luring him into a dark alley, robbing him, and usually cutting his throat. Such was the fate awaiting Achiko, unless a group of passing adventurers noticed them, grew suspicious, and intervened, but Achiko was oblivious and useless in a fight. If they rescued him, his father might reward them.</p>
