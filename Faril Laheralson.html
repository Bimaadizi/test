<p>Faril Laheralson was a male human fighter and ranger and the Oversword of a 100-strong contingent of Purple Dragons based in the town of Thunderstone in Cormyr in the late 1360s and early 1370s DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Faril had a domineering and rowdy nature, and was coarse in his manners.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Laheralson cared deeply for his men but was concerned more with their morale and spirit than with their discipline. Thus, his troops were a rowdy bunch who enjoyed brawling and monster-slaying, and frequently got out of control and misbehaved in Thunderstone.</p>
<p>Although Laheralson personally respected King Azoun IV , he paid only lip service to the Crown's representatives and thought they were just soft bureaucrats who would waste his time. He usually ignored the Crown clerk Hurm Thiodor who he was supposed to work alongside. As the capital was so far away, he and his company of soldiers got away with a lot, as long as they kept the town loyal and didn't cause too much trouble.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Faril fought with a +4 longsword , a +2 shield , and +2 chain mail . He had a Purple Dragon ring and a healing potion .</p>
<p>His home near the barracks was quite untidy, being a typical bachelor's house.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the late 1360s DR , the folk of Thunderstone had once petitioned Lord Sarp Redbeard , the nominal ruler of the town, asking him to reprimand Laheralson over the behavior of his soldiers. Although Redbeard talked to Laheralson, the Oversword had the favor of King Azoun himself and Redbeard was unable to force the issue.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>In the late 1360s DR, there was a rumor or misconception around town that one had to pay Faril 500 gold pieces to get someone buried in the Honor Field of the Kelemvor's Garden cemetery, but this was not true.</p>
