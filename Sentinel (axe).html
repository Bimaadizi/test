<p>Sentinel were a variety of enchanted battleaxes created on the Sword Coast North in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>There existed three variants of the Sentinel weapon, each possessed a +1 , +2 , and +8 enchantments what made the axe's blade deadlier and guided the wielder's hand towards the target. Each variety boosted the wielder's abilities to hear and see, and radiated a soft white glow within 10 feet (3 meters). Lastly, the two stronger versions allowed the wielder to cast the true seeing spell once and twice per day respectively.</p>
<p>Sentinel could be created from an enchanted battleaxe and a slab of adamantite .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sentinel with a simpler +1 enchantment was forged by Master Blacksmith Marrok of Shining Knight Arms and Armor shop of Neverwinter to help the heroes who sought the cure from the dreaded Wailing Death of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Later the same year, a more powerful version was created by Master Blacksmith Barun of Beorunna's Well to help the forces of Neverwinter stand against Lady Aribeth the Betrayer , who led a marching army of Luskan in the deadly but short-lived Neverwinter-Luskan war.</p>
<p>When the Neverwinter-Luskan war was over, the Hero of Neverwinter and their companions became famed across Neverwinter. One dwarven smith, whose name was not imprinted into the weapon, set out to create a powerful +8 Sentinel , to honor the heroes. As he was working on the axe, his body became consumed by fever that drove him to create enchantments of strength and complexity he could never achieve in the past. The smith claimed that his god possessed him and blessed the weapon. This powerful Sentinel was locked in a display at the Halls of Justice in Neverwinter, until, one day, it disappeared never to be seen again.</p>
