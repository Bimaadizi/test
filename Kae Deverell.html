<p>Lord Commander Kae Deverell was a human member of the Purple Dragons of Cormyr and of the Harpers who was stationed at the stronghold of High Horn in the mid–14 th century DR . He was possessed by the god Bhaal , Lord of Murder, and became his new avatar during the Time of Troubles .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Time of Troubles in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , he helped the then-human Kelemvor and Midnight , who were pursued by Cyric and his men. Later, the fortress was attacked by the avatar of Bhaal, but thanks to the growing power of Midnight, they were able to capture the god. Against all prudence, Deverell wanted to put the god of the assassins on trial, and the delay caused by this permitted Bhaal to escape. In a twist of irony, Bhaal chose Deverell as his new avatar.</p>
<p>However, Deverell's spirit was not destroyed and was left searching for an entrance to the Fugue Plane in Kanaglym . There, he met Midnight and apologized to her for his stupidity.</p>
