<p>The Nightthief's Nimbleknife was an enchanted dagger that once belonged to an infamous Sembian Assassin only known as the Nightthief .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Nimbleknife was weak offensively, but its enchantments granted the weapon's user the boon of ambidexterity and improved their battle tumble skill.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Nightthief's Nimbleknife was first seen in the hands of the Nightthief, a Sembian assassin renowned for fighting with two daggers. The Nimbleknife was not used for its damage but rather for its enchantments that improved the assassin's performance in battle. On one occasion, a Sembian merchant with a vendetta against the Nightthief laid an ambush for the assassin. Unfortunately, this resulted in all twelve warriors in the merchant's employ dead and the bait, a 2 pounds (0.91 kilograms) diamond - gone.</p>
<p>Circa 1374 DR , the Nimbleknife has long left its notorious owners hands and found its way to the Moonsea region. Its new owner was Zain , a spy and an assassin in service of the ruler of Hillsfar .</p>
