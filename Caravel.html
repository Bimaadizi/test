<p>A caravel was a medium-sized sailing ship used in Amn and Waterdeep and on the Inner Sea by Cormyr , Sembia , and Impiltur . They were less popular in Turmish and Chondath .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Typically 60​ to ​70 feet (18​ to ​21 meters) long at the keel and 20 feet (6.1 meters) wide , caravels usually had two or three masts and no oars. A caravel's full deck was about 10 feet (3 meters) above the surface of the water, but it also usually had a small forecastle and sterncastle . The ship had a smooth hull, which was constructed around a strong internal framework.</p>
<p>Crew size ranged from a minimum of seven to fifteen and could carry up to a maximum of 30 to 50 , including passengers. It could bear a load of 120 tons of cargo. A caravel could be armed with a large weapon (such as a catapult or ballista ) but was not built to wield a ram. On the Inner Sea, the sails were usually square, but in Amn, caravels had triangular lateen sails which allowed the ship to tack into the wind.</p>
<p>Caravels were seaworthy and capable of deep sea voyages. Their sailing speeds were three miles per hour in light winds.</p>
<p>A typical caravel took three months to build within a small shipyard.</p>
