<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This dish required five egg whites, sugar, a sprinkle of vinegar , vanilla essence, corn starch, ten garlic cloves, and a pinch of salt . The egg whites were beaten with salt and vinegar, slowly adding in sugar , finely diced garlic, and vanilla . The mixture was mixed until evenly incorporated, then the starch was added to thicken and stabilize the mixture. The mixture then was shaped into medallions with an indentation in the middle and baked on a buttered sheet. The rest of the minced garlic was whipped with the cream until it could be piped into the baked meringue shells. This dish was best served immediately after the assembly was completed.</p>
