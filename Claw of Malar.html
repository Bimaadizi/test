<p>The Claw of Malar was a potent artifact associated with the god Malar the Beastlord.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Claw of Malar was an actual humanoid right hand, with gray skin and long, pointed fingernails. It clutched tightly a clear bauble. The wrist was set into an ornate golden cuff, which was suspended from a cord, enabling it to be worn around the neck.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Claw of Malar came into the possession of Pasha Abon Duum of Manshaka , who had made a deal with Malar himself. With its power, he thought he could challenge the power of Tyr , the Just God. Duum wore it on a cord around his neck.</p>
<p>However, in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , when Duum finally came to Gladsheim to confront Tyr, he was surprised to find the thief Conner instead. The Catlord snatched away the Claw of Malar and passed it to Conner. Ultimately, the real Tyr showed up and took the Claw; Conner had made a secret deal to bring him the Claw. Duum was left to cower before the god.</p>
