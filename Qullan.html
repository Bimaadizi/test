<p>A qullan was a rare creature, resembling a tall and muscular humanoid covered in scars and warpaint.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Qullans were heavily muscular humanoids that stood over 8 ft (2.4 m) tall. They rarely wore armor; they often roamed naked or in clothes fashioned from the pelts of tigers . Qullans prided themselves on their battle scars, often enhancing such former wounds with warpaint.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Qullans were a tribal species and seemed to be isolationist. Making contact with qullans often proved impossible. They had incredible concentration, allowing them to resist even the most brutal tortures.</p>
<p>Forcing a qullan to do something atypical, or charming them, would cause a "feedback" effect on the one wishing to communicate with the qullan, killing them.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>These humanoids typically fought with broadswords . These were renowned for their incredible sharpness, which had not been replicated throughout the Realms . But despite their power, these swords easily blunted.</p>
<p>As well as honing great physical prowess, qullans continuously emitted rays of confusion , causing anyone coming close to the creatures to either stand on the spot, or attack a nearby creature, either friend or foe, if they could not resist the rays.</p>
<p>Many qullans were proficient in producing and utilizing poisons, which they made into darts and fired through blowpipes . Such potent poisons would bring death to their target, unless those of incredible holy power intervened.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Due to their isolationist ways, making contact with qullans often proved impossible. They usually stuck to their own, and never befriended humans or near-human races. If a qullan mated with a human, their "inferior" offspring was rejected, being evicted from their tribe.</p>
<p>Dakon were known to hold great hostility towards qullan. This often resulted in violent conflicts with them and their banderlog allies.</p>
