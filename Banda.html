<p>Banda was a town and fortress in the Kuong Kingdom in Malatra , standing just south of the northern border with T'u Lung .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The fortress was built as a show of strength, but T'u Lung displayed little interest in marching over the border. It had a garrison of 1,000 soldiers, who conducted patrols of the surrounding jungle and provided escorts for the merchant caravans.</p>
<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>Instead, in the midâ€“14 th century DR , Banda was a center for the production of silk , which was notably light and gauzy. The town did heavy trade, sending much of the silk to the river-port of Kataburi .</p>
