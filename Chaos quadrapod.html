<p>A chaos quadrapod was a horror from the Far Realm . The creature was bent on spreading the disruptive energy from that plane and on causing destruction everywhere it went.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The chaos quadrapod consisted of four mucus-covered, suckered tentacles protruding from a central body apparently made of pulsing light. The tentacles were responsible for the creature's movement, dragging it along while making disturbing slurping sounds.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>The aggressive creature could attack its prey by wrapping and squeezing them with its tentacles, which could reach as far as 15 feet (4.6 meters) from its main body. It was also capable of unleashing some of the energy from the Far Realm onto an area within a range of 60 feet (18 meters), causing an explosion of sickly ethereal light that could temporarily stun all creatures within a radius of 20 feet (6.1 meters). Chaos quadrapods were resistant against magical effects.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Duplicitous Courtier, 1496 DR , a chaos quadrapod invaded a pocket dimension connected to a portal aboard the sailboat Dangerous Business , following a confrontation between Dran Enterprises and the Six . The creature remained confined to the self-contained space while the ship was docked at Luskan for over a month, infusing it with energy from the Far Realm.</p>
