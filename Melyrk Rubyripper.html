<p>Melyrk Rubyripper was the eccentric shopkeeper of Mad Melyrk's in Thentia in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Melyrk had keen eyes and spoke rapidly with a nasally voice.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was somewhat manic and mischievous, and greatly enjoyed haggling and scoring bargains.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Melyrk treated haggling and bargain-hunting as a mix of art and game. Despite his odd behaviour, Melyrk was exceptionally good at appraising the value of the goods that passed through his shop. He was one of the few Thentian residents to discover that the Zhentish merchants Amthrud and Beldergast were actually spies, and kept a close eye on them to discern their plans.</p>
