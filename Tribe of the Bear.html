<p>The Tribe of the Bear was a nomadic group of Reghedman barbarians living in the tundra that comprised Icewind Dale .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Battle of Icewind Dale in the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR , the Tribe of the Bear attacked the town of Termalaine .</p>
<p>After the Year of the Iron Dwarf's Vengeance, 1485 DR , only two Bear tribe chieftains remained: Wolvig Barrundson and Günvald Halraggson . However, Wolvig turned to evil and allied himself with the Ice Witch, also known as Hedrun Arnsfirth , and Hedrun's defeat meant Wolvig's downfall also. Thus Günvald, as last surviving chieftain, declared himself the Bear King.</p>
<p>Some time before the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , a group of self-exiled tribesmen relocated to the Cave of the Berserkers . These barbarians devoted themselves to Auril and became corrupted by the malevolent substance known as chardalyn .</p>
