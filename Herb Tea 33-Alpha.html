<p>Herb Tea 33-Alpha was a herbal tea blend that could circumvent a giff 's resistance to certain kinds of restorative magic and medicine.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Herb Tea 33-Alpha was prepared from a mix of elderberries , elderflower , chamomile , rose hips , astragalus , and echinacea , which was wrapped in thin paper and left in hot water for 20 minutes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the giff mercenary commander Lieutenant Prook escaped from the slaver ship Er'lir Fezrrega'l after it crash-landed in Icewind Dale , he carried written instructions detailing how to help him should he succumb to the elements. These instructions included what was referred to as "Emergency Protocol 33-Alpha", which called for the use of Herb Tea 33-Alpha, as most standard methods of restoration known on Toril wouldn't work on giff. A recipe for the tea was also included.</p>
