<p>A candle of propitiousness was an enchanted candle that enhanced combat effectiveness against a particular enemy.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The user of this magic item would light the candle and identify a particular foe, preferably by name but a detailed description would suffice. Anyone located within a 50 ft (15 m) radius of the lit candle would find it easier to strike the selected foe during combat. The candle would also slightly hinder the selected foe's combat effectiveness if they came within 50 ft (15 m) of it. These magical effects only worked when there were no physical barriers between the candle and the foe.</p>
<p>A candle of propitiousness would burn for up to one hour once lit, but moving the candle would negate its magic. The magic would end if the candle was extinguished for any reason. This item could only be used once before its magic was lost.</p>
<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
<p>Noora bint Amon , a beloved hakima from Zakhara , carried a bag of bones . Noora's candle was unique in that it could be used repeatedly for a maximum cumulative duration of one hour before losing its magic.</p>
