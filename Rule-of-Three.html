<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Rule-of-Three was just about the most knowledgeable source on the Abyss available. He dwelt on Azzagrat in the city of Zelatar or in Sigil . He was allied with Graz'zt, and knew much about the Abyssal Realms. When in Azzagrat, he stayed in the back room of an inn called the Golden Opportunity . People searching for information from him could easily access it, but for a three-pronged price, such as precious metals of three different types or three magic items.</p>
<p>Rule-of-Three was the mastermind behind the plan for which he was named, a uniting of tanar'ri, yugoloth, and baatezu to take over the upper planes.</p>
