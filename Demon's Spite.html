<p>Demon's Spite was an enchanted short sword thought to be a relic from the fields of the infinite Blood War .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Demon's Spite had a certain malicious aura about it, and it inspired a twinge of its ill-nature in anyone who even dared to gaze at the weapon. The sword possessed a +1 enchantment and had a good chance of infecting its targets with demon fever . The magics held within the sword made it usable only by creatures that followed the path of evil and destruction.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Demon's Spite was created alongside its sister blade, the Devil's Guile , and apart from that, little else was known about both swords. Some believed that the short sword was forged in the Abyss , but it was likely mere speculation, based on the Demon's Spite's malicious magics. For a long time, the weapon was considered just a legend until it resurfaced in Westgate in the hands of the city's ruling merchant council member. The sword had spent a couple of years with the councilman until a well-publicized burglary. Subsequently, Demon's Spite occasionally appeared in local rumors, claiming its use by Westgate's criminal underbelly.</p>
<p>Circa the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , both swords were wielded by Rinara of Westgate, an ex-member of the Night Masks . She used the magic weapons in her attempts to rid the guild of the influence of the vampires who took over the organization several years prior.</p>
