<p>Thurm was a brother of Basillus , the addled murderous cleric of Cyric who terrorized Beregost in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thurm, along with the rest of Basillus' family were from Zhentil Keep of the Moonsea region. Sometime in or before 1368 DR, presumably during the Siege of Zhentil Keep , Basillus' family, including brother Thurm, perished. The trauma left Basillus mad and led him to murder innocent townies and raising them as his undead "family".</p>
