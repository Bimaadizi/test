<p>The Dunobo Springs were a group of small springs located in the forested foothills of the mountains surrounding the Pasocada Basin . During the spring, the small streams fed by the springs turned into the Danozi Wash , which was responsible for creating the Sun Canyon . The Azuposi often cut down trees from around the springs.</p>
<p>Performing a sacred ceremony while immersed in the pool at the head of the springs opens a portal to the Astral Plane along a mystical road called the Sun Trail , which leads to the demiplane of Wenimats and the layer of Brux in the Happy Hunting Grounds .</p>
