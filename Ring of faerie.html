<p>Ring of faerie were enchanted rings specially crafted by the grey elves of Oerth that mimicked their race's innate abilities. These were only ever gifted to allies of the grey elves or people they considered to be their closest associates.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When hiding within woodlands a wearer could only be detected by creatures that could see the invisible . When on their own a wearer could move far more stealthily. Wearers also had greater chances of discovering concealed or hidden doors and their eyes could see in infravision out to a range of 60 feet (18 meters).</p>
<p>Each ring of faerie was enchanted with an alignment of either good , evil , or neutral . If an individual was not of the corresponding alignment, then their ring of faerie would not function for them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1357 DR , during the ongoing conflicts in Illefarn , a member of Korin Ironaxe 's dwarven forces by the name of Gorn somehow possessed one of these Oerthian rings.</p>
