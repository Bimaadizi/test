<p>Uttercaps (or fairy clusters ) were a kind of edible mushroom found mainly around Blustich in Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Uttercaps were found in clusters of 5–8 nut-brown caps about the size of the end-joint of a human thumb, growing from very dark-brown slender stems about the length of a human hand. They tasted similar to roasted almonds , and were fortunately very visually distinct from local poisonous mushrooms.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Uttercaps grew prolifically around Blustich on the Cormyrean coast and were regularly harvested to supplement the food supply of the village along with khondyn and thoud mushrooms, particularly before winter.</p>
<h2>Usages</h2>
<p>Uttercaps could be eaten raw, but were also fried in butter or boar fat , and were often eaten as snacks by the children of Blustich as they played outside the village. They were sometimes added to brandy , which imparted a nutty, buttery, near- cinnamon taste to the drink.</p>
