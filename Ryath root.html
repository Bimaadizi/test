<p>Ryath root was a variety of plant that could be found in the jungles of Chult . They were known to have healing properties, although they were mildly poisonous .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Ryath roots grew out of the ground in groups of up to six. They were considered a rarity in the Chultan jungle, and were evidently a favorite of Chult's wild boars .</p>
<h3>Uses</h3>
<p>When eaten raw, a ryath root could give a creature a temporary boost to their hardiness, although consuming more than one root in a day left the creature feeling ill for about an hour.</p>
<p>The root could alternatively be mashed into a cream and prepared as a medicine by a skilled healer or druid . In this form, it could be carefully dosed: one dose was moderately curative, two doses were significantly more effective, but three or more doses had no benefits as any healing properties were negated by feelings of sickness and over-indulgence. A vial could contain up to two doses.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first recorded discovery of how to mash and dose ryath root was by the druid Arvo of Ravens Bluff in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<p>Ryath roots were grown in the gardens of Nangalore and could be found in Omu .</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, a whole ryath root sold for 50 gold pieces in Chult. Their sale in Port Nyanzaru was governed by Jessamine , the merchant prince who oversaw the sale of local plants.</p>
