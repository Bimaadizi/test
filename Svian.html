<p>Svian was a somewhat famous Reghedmen warrior of the Tribe of the Elk who was an unmoving wall of stone in battle sometime long before the late 13 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Svian, a man of imposing stature, stood tall and wiry, his grim countenance a reflection of his inner strength. He was renowned in the north for his stoicism, serious demeanor, and unwavering cool in battle.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Svian won many battles in his life, never getting scared, never getting excited, by simply standing firm and devastating his enemies with powerful blows. It was believed that when he was gravely injured in battle, sometime before the late 13 th century DR, Svian simply walked to a rock, sat down, with no indication of pain, and died. It would take his tribesmen several hours to realize Svian had passed. He left behind a powerful enchanted club that would later be known as Svian's club . The weapon followed its master to the Reghedmen Burial Isle and stayed there at least until the Year of the Starving, 1381 DR , when it was recovered from the recently disturbed dead by the hermit wizard Eddion Carradoc .</p>
