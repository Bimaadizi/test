<p>Du'Quelve Hunzrin was a priestess of House Hunzrin in Menzoberranzan in the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Du'Quelve was often ordered by Matron Arolina Hunzrin to lead trade expeditions outside Menzoberranzan .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Shattered Oak, 1313 DR , during one of these missions, the Hunzrin met two priestesses, Iccara and Bolfae , who said they'd come from the previously unknown Arach Enclave . Matron Arolina ordered Du'Quelve to secretly transport the two priestesses to her. However, a mission headed by Beniago and Zaknafein Do'Urden was following them. Iccara promised to Du'Quelve a load of arandur and the service of a deep gnome slave, Symvyn Rivenstone . Some time later, Du'Quelve went with Iccara to the meeting with the deep gnome and forced him to dispel the wards of the gnome's outpost. However, Zaknafein, Jarlaxle , and Kimmuriel Oblodra suddenly arrived and in the fighting Iccara was revealed to be a yochlol . In the end, Zaknafein destroyed Iccara, injured Du'Quelve and freed Symvyn.</p>
<p>In later years, Du'Quelve's career stagnated despite her claim to having been in league with two yochlols, as all knew she had only been tricked by the handmaidens.</p>
