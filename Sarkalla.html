<p>Sarkalla was a crazy Red Wizard of Thay in the Doomvault dungeon in 1486 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Sarkalla, in a word, was mad. Her main objective was to create a truly sentient ooze in order to use it as a "perfect assassin". She was greatly proud of her Ooze Master, and considered it her crowning achievement.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sarkalla was a transmuter assigned to the secret complex of Doomvault located under Thaymount . She was tasked with the mission of creating a perfect assassin and she decided that the best way was to create a sentient ooze. In time Sarkalla had success only in fusing humans and oozes, creating the Ooze Master .</p>
<p>Heroes from Daggerford fought with her wight minions, but after they destroyed the wights Sarkalla called a truce. She proposed that, if the heroes served as bodyguards and assistants for the Ooze Master, then she would give them information about the dungeon.</p>
