<p>The Schamedar Plains were the fertile countryside east of the city of Schamedar in Calimshan .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The plains extended east from Schamedar to the River of Ice , and contained many small towns and villages.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , men from the towns and villages in the plains rose up to fight against Shond Tharovin and his Cult of the Living Gem . Calling themselves the Seven Satraps , they raised a small army and with it held the city of Schamedar under siege for nearly a year, until they were finally able to drive the Cult out of the city and into hiding.</p>
<p>After the Spellplague and the Second Era of Skyfire , the Calim Desert expanded so far east that its sands encompassed the plains until the River.</p>
