<p>Handaramatur was a sage who lived in the North Ward of the city of Waterdeep in the early 1300's DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the harsh winter of 1331 DR , Handaramatur was said to have died of a "contagious fever." The "shady secrets" he was alleged to have discovered and written down were never found, though whether this was due to theft or hiding was uncertain. In later years, the cul-de-sac he lived on would be renamed in his honor to Handaramatur's Court .</p>
