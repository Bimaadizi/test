<p>A fiendish flesh golem was a type of flesh golem that was formed from various fiends , namely devils , yugoloths and demons . They were particularly large constructs , each of which was unique in its design.</p>
<p>The secret to creating fiendish flesh golems was known only to night hags and they rarely shared this esoteric knowledge with others.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In addition to their monstrous size and unholy appearance, some fiendish flesh golems were made to have wings.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Like many golems, these creatures were resistant to magic and their form could not be changed by any arcane means. They were also resistant to the elements of cold and fire and were actually healed by electric bolts.</p>
<p>If a fiendish flesh golem received significant damage they went berserk, attempting to attack and damage anyone and anything nearby.</p>
