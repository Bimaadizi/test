<p>Yellow Hills was a little-known and mostly unimportant gnomish settlement in Faerûn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the only notable thing that came from Yellow Hills were Dangle-Sit-Me-Doodles , a type of eccentric chairs that were so preposterous, they were sure to become the latest rage in the City of Splendors, Waterdeep . The equally eccentric merchant and interiors decorator Yani Pavani was especially enamored with the outlandish items.</p>
