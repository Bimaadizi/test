<h2>History</h2>
<p>Frefford and Gaylyn had her wedding ceremony in 1357 DR. The bride's father Dimswart spared no expense on the ceremony, trying to impress the Wyvernspur family. One of the things the bride's family laid gold for were services of a famous bard Olive Ruskettle ). Shortly before the wedding, the bard was abducted by a red dragon prowling on the Storm Horns and a sellsword named Alias was hired to retrieve the entertainment. The swordswoman succeeded but the wedding celebration was interrupted after all when Alias, controlled by her azure bonds, attempted to assassinate who she believed was King Azoun Obarskyr IV , and who was in fact Frefford's darling cousin, Giogioni Wyvernspur . The attempt was foiled when the sellsword's friends collapsed the tent on the crowd. Even though Lady Leona was furious over this, Gaylyn, Frefford, and their friends emerged from under the tent giggling hysterically.</p>
