<p>Bordovan was one of the four bartenders who also worked as bouncers of the Copper Coronet in the River District of Athkatla , in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bordovan was built like a wall of muscles. He was a balding man wearing a number of jingling earrings who worked wearing his breastplate , greaves , and armored codpiece . Judging by his posturing and physique, Bordovan was a steeled warrior. When at the Coronet, Bordovan showed little friendliness to the tavern's customers, keeping stoic professional attitude.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR, Bordovan was an established member of the Copper Coronet's staff. He, along with Vaermaer , Delric , and Othlo , was supervised by Old Sarvo Droostan , the Coronet's tavernmaster. Bordovan worked in full armor and was proficient in stopping trouble, fighting off rowdy drunkards, spotting drunk spell-casting, and faked intoxication. Bordovan and the rest of the mountainous bouncer-bartenders kept large rocks behind the bar. These rocks were used as projectiles, thrown around with immaculate precision at drunken troublemakers. Bordovan's attitude changed to that of a glacier when an obviously rich visitor entered the Coronet or one of Athkatla's officials arrived. Bordovan and his fellow bartenders did not tolerate patrons harassing the Copper Coronet's female employees.</p>
