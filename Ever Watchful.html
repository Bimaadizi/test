<p>Ever Watchful , later known as Vindicator , was the favored weapon of Helm , the deity of guardians and protectors.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ever Watchful was a mighty bastard sword that Helm preferred to wield two-handed. The sword had the symbol of Helm (a watchful eye with a blue pupil emblazoned on an upright gauntlet ) on its hilt. It glowed with silvery flame, and anyone unworthy of wielding it felt a burning sensation when they grasped it.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>In the hands of Helm's avatar , the weapon was an incredibly powerful keen bastard sword that was both holy and lawful . It therefore struck hardest against evil and chaotic foes, and such creatures would be weakened should they touch the sword.</p>
<p>Among mortals who were deemed worthy to wield it, Ever Watchful could be recalled to their hands regardless of where it was. These individuals also had the ability to wreathe themselves in an armor of faith that manifested as luminous grey plate mail . The grey color of both the armor and the sword's flames were said to represent the lawful neutral ideology of Helm's justice: neither evil (black) nor good (white).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>While Helm had wielded many weapons, Ever Watchful was his preference. During the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR , Helm killed the goddess of magic , Mystra , although he used his gauntleted fist rather than his sword to do so.</p>
<p>In the Year of Three Streams Blooded, 1384 DR , Helm was killed in an honor-duel with Tyr . His sword, now more often referred to as " Vindicator ," arrived on Faer√ªn that same year in the hands of Gedrin Thalvar after he had a vision of the god's death. Gedrin would go on to wield the blade in the name of justice as a vigilante called "Shadowbane."</p>
<p>Many years later, Gedrin gave the sword to Kalen Dren , who took up Gedrin's Shadowbane mantle and carried the sword until the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR , at which point he no longer felt worthy of the blade and gave it to a young paladin named Rhett Hawkwinter . The two would end up passing the sword back and forth until Rhett disappeared in Westgate and the blade was returned to Kalen in pieces. Kalen was able to reassemble the sword using divine power, and fearing Rhett dead, journeyed to Westgate to find answers. There, Kalen found a third wielder of the sword, his first apprentice Vaelis , whom he had thought dead.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>As the calling card of the holy vigilante Shadowbane, Ever Watchful (known as Vindicator ) was an object of both terror and veneration throughout the 15 th century DR in both Waterdeep and Westgate . It also served as a very tangible reminder that Helm's power still persisted even if the god himself was dead, and therefore may have helped to keep Helmite faith alive until he returned in the Year of the Nether Mountain Scrolls, 1486 DR .</p>
