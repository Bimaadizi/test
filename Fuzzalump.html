<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sir Fuzzalump had a stern, humorless demeanor, deep age lines on his face, and a full head of luscious long white hair and a thick beard.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, Sir Fuzzalump had been single-mindedly committed to his magical research of cave moss for quite some time. His humorless academic demeanor attracted endless mocking and ridicule among his humorous gnomish kin. At one point, Sir Fuzzalump claimed that he had not giggled in over a decade, nor had he ever frolicked. Fuzzalump met his untimely end in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , only to end up among the dozen individuals plucked from the Fugue Plane , chosen by the entity Withers to aid in his campaign against the Dead Three .</p>
