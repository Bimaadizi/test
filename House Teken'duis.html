<p>House Teken'duis was formerly a noble drow house in the district of West Wall in Menzoberranzan .</p>
<h2>Headquarters</h2>
<p>House Teken'duis resided in a two-stalagmite compound in the northwest part of the city in West Wall.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>House Teken'duis was the seventeenth house in 1297 DR . After the elimination of House De Vir , it became the sixteenth house.</p>
<p>In 1319 DR , House Teken'duis attempted to attack and defeat House Freth . However, it failed to eliminate all noble witnesses of the attack; two females and a male. Thus, all members of the house were executed by the Ruling Council. House Baenre made a public spectacle of this execution: The Mistresses of Arach-Tinilith opened portals to the lower planes, and conjured demons to aid in the execution. Together with the students and masters of Melee Magthere and Sorcere , they overran the house and slaughtered the entrenched drow.</p>
<p>The ruined manor remained abandoned in West Wall.</p>
