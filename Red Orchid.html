<p>The Red Orchid was a ship sunk in the Sea of Fallen Stars by the exiled eladrin Caelynna .</p>
<p>The ship was touched by the Spellplague and made sentient. For over eighty years, she remained in Cealynna's domain, unable to move, until Kwan Shang-Li 's crew found the ship and removed the figurehead and attached it to their own ship. The Red Orchid 's spirit helped the crew to refloat their ship. When Cealynna attacked the ship, the figurehead fought a giant squid ally of Cealynna.</p>
