<p>Bullard Boareskyr and his brother Becil Boareskyr were dimwitted descendants of the legendary hero Boareskyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Both brothers were red-faced and burly.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The brothers did not inherit their ancestor's enterprising spirit or his common sense. They were uneducated and lived in poverty in their backwater village. Perhaps it was the only place they truly fit in. Bullard was the less outspoken of the brothers.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The brothers inherited titles and lands from their ancestor Boareskyr , the hero who built the first Boareskyr Bridge .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1371 DR , the Boareskyr brothers were in the process of finalizing a trade pact with the city of Waterdeep that would have allowed caravans to cross Boareskyr Bridge on their way to Kara-Tur . They refused to sign the papers until the wedding between the Open Lord of Waterdeep Piergeiron the Paladinson and Eidola of Neverwinter , a member of the Boareskyr clan. While Becil was navigating the agreement negotiations, Bullard only cared about Piergeiron's sword Halcyon , repeatedly asking the Open Lord to see the sword up close and annoying the man tremendously.</p>
