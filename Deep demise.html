<p>Deep demise was a powerful and malevolent dagger provided by the demon lord Graz'zt when he visited the mines of Tethyamar in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The dagger was a jagged chunk of gleaming razor-sharp crystal or stone melded with a handle. It reflected the face of its wielder in its surface, though the reflection always wore a wide unsettling grin.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>While an exceptionally deadly implement in its own right, its true power was in the hands of a spellcaster. It sharpened the mind and greatly improved illusion spells that the wielder cast.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Deep demise was left behind by Graz'zt after his schemes with the jewels of ardor in the ruins of Tethyamar were uncovered by the dwarves of the Tethyamar Mining Outpost . He intentionally left the blade as a prize for his foes when they "defeated" him, before he departed for parts unknown.</p>
