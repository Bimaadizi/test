<p>A stained glass golem was a type of golem resembling stained glass. They were constructed to blend in with the decor of a temple or palace, in order to hide them from view to all except unwanted visitors.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They resembled flat, two-dimensional imitations of people made from glass. They were silent and never communicated; the only sound they made was a tinkling sound like delicate crystal wind chimes when they moved. As they moved, they flickered and twinkled as the light passing through them refracted.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like many golems, glass golems possessed a general immunity to most magic and spells . Though the material that made up their bodies also made glass golems one of the most vulnerable types of golem, making them vulnerable to sonic spells and the spell shatter , their appearance also allowed them to blend in perfectly with any window.</p>
<p>A stained glass golem could be repaired with mending , but healed rapidly on its own.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>They fought by swinging their arms; like broken glass, their edges were very sharp.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>They were typically encountered alone, in pairs, or in groups of up to five.</p>
<h3>Construction</h3>
<p>To create a stained glass golem, a high-level arcane spellcaster skilled in glass-making required some 50 pounds (23 kilograms) of glass shards and the spells geas/quest , limited wish , and polymorph any object , and it otherwise cost 10,000 gold pieces .</p>
<h3>Usages</h3>
<p>Deep within the jungles of Chult , four of these golems were installed by the necromancer Zzarka Tuzarr within the stained glass windows of her sandstone pyramid stronghold .</p>
<p>Within the quiet village of Irl , many of the larger and wealthier families had a number of stained glass golems at their command.</p>
