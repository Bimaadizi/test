The garments of her crafting became popular in the black markets and streets of Luskan sometime before 1372 DR . Eventually, the Arcane Brotherhood discovered that she was selling the secrets of the Host Tower of the Arcane and their wrath was horrible. The creator of the robes of energy was roasted slowly over an open flame.</p>
<p>By 1372 DR, copies of these robes were present in several cities along the Sword Coast.</p>
