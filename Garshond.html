<h2>History</h2>
<p>Garshond was active near Iriaebor during the Year of the Shattered Altar, 1264 DR , defending the region against orc and goblinoid armies. During one of those battles, a holy helmet rose out of a battlefield bog and presented itself to the cleric. It was unclear whether Helm created the item at that moment, or took it from the bones of an older champion of his faith laying under the waters of the bog.</p>
<p>Garshond took the relic back to the Watchtower of the Vigilant , his temple in Harkstag . There he organized a Council of Helm by inviting representatives from important families of Iriaebor, Waterdeep and Scornubel . This successful reunion led to the creation of the Vigilant Riders during the Year of Flowers, 1265 DR , and established Garshond as one of the most prominent Helmite priests of his generation.</p>
<p>Garshond took part of many fights alongside the Riders , defending the region against brigands and goblinkin during what would later be known as Garshond's War . He lost his life in one such battles, during the Year of Daystars, 1268 DR .</p>
