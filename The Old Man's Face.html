<p>The Old Man's Face was a rundown inn found in Tyrluk along the High Road in Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A carved wooden sign of a cheerful old man hung outside of the inn's entrance.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Despite the welcoming sign, the inn was not a place where strangers were greeted with open arms. Most of the patrons were locals who ate the inn's simple fare and drank the bad beer.</p>
<p>The local patrol of Purple Dragons was the only source of outside regular paying customers. The locals amused themselves with guessing which of the male soldiers would marry one of the female soldiers.</p>
