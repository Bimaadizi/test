<p>The Cold Field was a flat, treeless moor located south of Cormanthor and Velarswood between Harrowdale and Scardale .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Cold Field was a battlefield haunted by ghosts of soldiers. The land was scarred by dragon's breath . It was most dangerous in winter. In summertime, shepherds from the local dales used the field as pasture for their sheep, since the animals didn't mind the restless spirits.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Cold Field was the site of a great battle and was therefore haunted by ghosts. Mathira Melarn , an Eilistraeean priestesses and bearer of the Crescent Blade , was slain here and the blade wound up in the gullet of a purple worm . The blade was retrieved in 1372 DR by Halisstra Melarn and Ryld Argith ; Halisstra then carried the blade to the Demonweb Pits , intending (but failing) to slay Lolth .</p>
