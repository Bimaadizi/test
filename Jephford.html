<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the aftermath of the massacre at the Council of the Dragon of Cormyr in late Mirtul of the 1479 DR , Jephford was part of a group including the War Wizard Glathra Barcantle , Lord Warder Vainrence , a Highknight named Eldur Hawkmantle , Jephford himself, and three other Purple Dragons. Jephford was one of these Purple Dragons; after Glathra revealed they were seeking out the sages Orkrash , Loagranboydar , Garendor , Argrant , and Wyshbryn , and that they were doing other tasks as well, Jephford blurted out she must be looking for nobles born with a talent for the Art so as to determine who was responsible for the blueflame ghost featuring in the massacre. Glathra all but confirmed his conclusion.</p>
<p>After the five sages were discovered slain, Vainrence cast a spell to determine how they were killed. A lurking contingency exploded the room in response. Only one of the Purple Dragons survived.</p>
