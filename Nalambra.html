<p>Nalambra was a maid in Neverwinter in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The young maid had a noticeably muscled back.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The woman was notably idiotic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , she and fellow maid Karlae was hired by Auvrarn Labraster , who was spell-disguised as Blandras Nuin , after he slew his maid Alaithe .</p>
<p>On the last day that they worked for him, he arrived wet and soiled from a late evening of drinking, to find them holding garden shears and fire-tongs, which they had no reason to be using. They fled at his screams. He took a bath immediately, and when he called for them to bring him hot rocks, they screamed and made a racket. He'd later find them undressed in his bed, with their hair combed, after being confronted by the ghost of Anastra Sylun√© Silverhand , who was pretending to be the ghost of the maid Alaithe.</p>
<p>He leapt between them, waking and startling them. They ran out the door, tripping on each other, and then down the hallway, where the ghost ensorcelled them into a deep sleep, and then made their bodies hover, open-eyed yet knocked out, in a stiff position, outlining their shapes with dancing lights to better haunt him. That spooked him alright.</p>
<p>Afterwards, as the Simbul arrived, she made a point of making the house explode. However, she spared Karlae and Nalambra from the explosion, leaving them unharmed at the end of the ruckus.</p>
