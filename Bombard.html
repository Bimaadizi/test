<p>Bombards , sometimes referred to as cannons , were a rare type of large siege engine used on spelljammers and maritime ships. The artillerists who manned bombards were sometimes referred to as bombardiers.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The typical bombard consisted of a short, thick barrel that was cast from wrought iron or bronze and set within a rigid wooden base. The standard bombard was divided into two types, light and heavy. Light bombards were otherwise known as "firesticks", while heavy bombards were otherwise referred to colloquially as "hurlpits" or more formally as "farhurlers". The former derived from the fact that pits tended to be created when the stones they hurled landed. On some worlds a cannon might have a wooden frame with wheels to support it, but the bombards of Toril lacked any such gun-carriages.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>Bombards required a crew of at least three to man them. They fell under the siege weapon category of "bombardment engines". Much like other weapons within that category, such as catapults and trebuchets , bombards were direct-fire weapons that fired their missiles in high arcs.</p>
<p>The missiles fired by bombards were typically large spheres of stones or cast iron. These were referred to as either " cannonballs " or "bombard shot". And on rare occasions necromancers created boneballs of skeletal undead to fire at enemy ships, which would turn into a shower of lacerating bone shards if not magically protected.</p>
<p>Much like other firearms , bombards required either gunpowder or smokepowder to fire. The choice of powder was dependent upon availability and the metaphysical laws of a given crystal sphere . Regardless of whichever was used, bombards consumed large, coming down to roughly ten charges of smokepowder.</p>
<p>The firing of a bombards was followed by a thunderously loud noise. Their rate of fire was rather slow, as they needed to be cooled and cleaned of debris after every firing. And they were subject to misfiring.</p>

<h2>Varieties</h2>
<p>Due to their size and crudeness, instances of magical bombards were incredibly rare, though slightly more common in wildspace.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first recorded usage of bombards by the people of Lantan occurred early in the Year of Burning Steel, 1246 DR . These early bombards used gunpowder , as the substance had not yet been made inert on Toril and because the Lantanna had yet to discover and perfect the recipe for smokepowder.</p>
<p>The wizard Elminster felt this development was significant enough to warrant arranging a private meeting with Storm Silverhand to discuss them. Through the use of his magic he showed a visual display of the bombard testing and mused that they would likely be put to use in mainland Faerûn before the year was out. Storm reasoned that it was likely rulers throughout the Realms would send mages to either capture or kill the makers of this new weapon, then asked if she should slay them first, but Elminster admonished that he already asked Mystra and she forbade it. Instead, Elminster instructed Storm to travel with the Harper Aumarra Kethtan to Lantan and protect its people from any would-be "murderous capturing mages".</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Thayan spies had also observed the tests being conducted in Lantan and reported back to their Red Wizard masters. The Red Wizards determined that it was crucial for them to have command of such weapons themselves, beginning development on what would become the Thayan bombard .</p>
<p>After gunpowder was rendered inert in 1356 DR , all further developments in standard bombards would be done with smokepowder. And despite Elminster's concerns, the Lantanna still had yet to export their bombards to mainland Faerûn by 1358 DR . This was potentially due in part to the fact that bombards, along with many other inventions of the Lantanna, were of concern to both the Harpers organization and the nation of Halruaa due to their great potential for destruction. Both groups heavily monitored the island nation, with the Halruaans observing from high above in their skyships . The Thayan bombard as well did not see much action outside of Thay itself, due in part to the Red Wizards wanting to maintain secrecy with their weapon.</p>
<p>By the 15 th century DR , the usage of bombards on Toril remained in a state of relative rarity. This was due to gun-carriages being uncommon, which made bombards dangerous to use on most ships, and shortages in smokepowder in the wake of the Spellplague .</p>
