<p>Intercession was an enchanted , intelligent longsword that granted the wielder added skill at deflecting incoming attacks.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>While the sturdy steel sword appeared rather mundane―with a simple blade, guard, and grip made of ogre -skin leather―it possessed significant power. Intercession possessed slight empathetic intelligence and was capable of guiding the movements of its wielder.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Intercession struck more true and inflicted more harm than non-magical blades, in thanks to its +1 enchantment . By means of the empathic bond it formed, the sword helped its wielder block and deflect incoming melee attacks.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The sword was crafted by Peth , a wizard that lived in Elturel as of the Year of the Shrieker, 1272 DR . Peth made the weapon specifically for an acquaintance of his, a ranger from Soubar named Kelhanion .</p>
<p>Kelhanion was killed by over a dozen trolls when traveling through the Trollbark Forest some years later.</p>
<p>Sometime over the next decade, Intercession made its way north to the icy keep of Dragon's Eye in the Spine of the World mountains.</p>
