<h2>History</h2>
<p>Palaghard was known as the conqueror of Esparin . However, Queen Enchara married Prince Palaghard in the Year of the Prancing Centaur, 1162 DR , and with their union the kingdom was annexed by Cormyr.</p>
<p>Palaghard was crowned King of Cormyr in the Year of Long Shadows, 1164 DR . The master jewelers of Procampur crafted a new crown for him, but it was stolen when the legendary pirate Immurk the Invincible raided the merchant-ship carrying the precious cargo. The crime was so audacious that Palaghard believed that no one could be so brave and that the jewelers of Procampur. must be cheating him instead. He gathered an army ready to attack, and nearly declared war on Procampur, before it was found out that the pirate Immurk was responsible. The crown was eventually recovered, but was so heavy, grandiose and ugly that it was only used for a few months.</p>
