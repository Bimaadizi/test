<p>The Absolute's warboard was a magical shield bearing the mark of the Absolute .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This large shield was made of wood and had several nails tacked onto it. Despite seeming like a simple rustic shield, it was actually enchanted.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When this shield was equipped and its powers were invoked, the wearer's armor was magically increased as per the shield of faith spell . However, unlike the spell itself, the shield would cause the wielder to remain imbued with magical armor until they rested (instead of just a few minutes). The powers could be reactivated following a short rest.</p>
