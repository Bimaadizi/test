<p>Zhuang Bei , whose zombie husk was used as a laborer in Mortuary of Sigil , in life was a tutor and bodyguard of Liu Xixi , daughter of Imperial Censor Chi'an sometime before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Zhuang Bei was a loyal, honorable, and genteel man who served Liu Xixi. He spent all his time teaching the young lady and protecting her from harm. He was renowned as a talented swordsman and a scholar.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>During his several weeks of life in Sigil, Zhuang Bei was approached by a woman member of the Dustmen . In their conversations, Zhuang realized that he shared a philosophy with the Dustmen of Sigil. He thought his body to be nothing but a vehicle that would be empty upon death. Zhuang thought the practice of selling one's body to the dustmen was a bit morbid, but still, it was worth the coin . He realized that he believed in the teaching of the "True Death" â€“ the exalted state to be attained.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>One day, Zhuang Bei taught a lesson about night sky constellations on a balcony overlooking the Courtyard. This was when a group of assassins swooped from above, surely to end the young woman's life or to kidnap her. Zhuang shouted to get the palace guards and stood up with his blade to defend his mistress. As the battle commenced, the balcony's railings broke, and all four people plummeted down and into the Jade Portal , a round pool in the Courtyard, tiled in green and white soapstone . The pool was named Jade Portal because it was said to show glimmers of another strange place in its waters on occasion.</p>
<p>When Zhuang Bei came to it, he lay with his leg broken in an unknown alley, miraculously spirited away to the planar city of Sigil through the Jade Portal. He watched as the assassins tossed Liu Xixi over their shoulders and fled. Eventually, Zhuang limped across the town and found a healer. He parted with the last coin to mend the broken leg, learned the language of the strange new city, and tried to find the kidnappers.</p>
<p>He tracked one of the men down and slew him. The assassin's head was placed in a silk bag to be returned to the Imperial Censor along with his daughter. However, that was not to be. The second assassin found Zhuang first and killed him.</p>
<p>Zhuang Bei's soul went on to reside within the realm of the Illustrious Magistrate, Yen-Wang-Ych : the Palace of Judgement . However, even in death, Zhuang faced with misfortune. His soul was to be escorted to his true final destination across the palace, but some commotion took place, and he was left to wait in a side room. The guides promised to attend to Zhuang momentarily. Noone returned. Zhuang waited for days before wandering off into the Palace in search of some guidance. He was forced to look through the Palace's 9,001 rooms. But each room just directed the soul to another room, leaving Zhuang Bei forever lost in the cracks of the Celestial Bureaucracy . In the late 14 th century DR, Zhuang Bei's dead body was raised as the Zombie Worker 1041. Before his death, Zhuang Bei was approached by a woman, a member of the Dustmen, who offered him a contract: his body was to be given to the Mortuary after death in exchange for a small sum of coin.</p>
<p>During the corpse's work on the first floor of the Mortuary, the mysterious planar adventurer remembered as the Nameless One , may have had conversed with Zhuang Bei through a priestly spell or via the uncanny Stories-Bones-Tell ability taught to him by Stale Mary of the Dead Nations .</p>
