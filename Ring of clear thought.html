<p>Rings of clear thought were enchanted rings that enhanced the wearer's mental prowess.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These rings were ensorcelled to increase the wearer's intelligence and created with a wide variety of enchantment strengths.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Rings of clear thought came into prominence after Resino from the town of Beregost became tormented by ghostly voices inside his mind. Eventually, the suffering became too much to handle, and the man begged clerics of the local church to end his suffering even if it were through death. The priests could not detect the cause of torment nor any demonic afflictions placed on the suffering man. The only remedy they could think of was gifting the man one of the rings of clear thought , hoping that the enchantment would clear and shield Resino's mind. Unfortunately, the ring's magic was useless against the affliction, and Resino took his own life sometime before 1372 DR .</p>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR many copies and variants of rings of clear thought could be found throughout the Sword Coast .</p>
