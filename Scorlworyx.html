<p>Scorlworyx was a red dragon in the Dragonspire Mountains in 1489 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>One day, she heard that the neighboring Circle of the Scale had claimed that, thanks to a scale of Tiamat herself, they could dominate all dragons. Enraged, Scorlworyx attacked the Circle and killed most of the members, bar their leader Skovac , who sealed himself in the temple with the relic.</p>
<p>In order to gain her aid, in 1489 DR, Tibeem and Spernik , agents of the reformed Cult of the Dragon , tried to recover the sacred scale.</p>
<p>Around 1492 DR Scorlworyx was intrigued by the new Pool of Radiance but was tricked by some adventurers.</p>
