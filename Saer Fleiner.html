<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , as the Cult of the Absolute menaced the city of Baldur's Gate, the gates between the Lower City of Baldur's Gate and its more affluent Upper City were closed, monitored by the Flaming Fist mercenaries and allowing only the wealthy and current residents of the Upper City through. Saer Fleiner was terrified of the cultist army that loomed over over city and was outraged by Baldur's Gate shutting the gates. The dwarf believed that the Upper City had more than enough space for everyone.</p>
