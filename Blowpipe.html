<p>Blowpipes , otherwise known as blowguns , were a type of exotic ranged weapon.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Blowpipes were long hollow tubes, ranging from 4​ to ​7 feet (1.2​ to ​2.1 meters) in length.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Some tribes were known to use stands to brace their blowpipes, in order to prevent swaying.</p>
<p>Beyond their purpose as a weapon, some were known to use blowpipes as breathing tubes for swimming underwater.</p>
<h2>Ammunition</h2>
<p>A wide variety of ammunition were known to be used in blowpipes. This included blowgun darts , needles, and little pellets of hardened clay. Darts were the most commonly used form of ammunition, while needles were used to deliver poison and pellets were used in hunting small game.</p>
<p>Blowgun darts were small arrows, with cotton or some other form of plant fiber used as fletching. This fletching made an efficient seal in the pipe, allowing for a greater build up of pressure from the wielder's breath. Feathers were often attached to keep them stable in flight.</p>
<p>Blowgun needles were typically 2 inches (0.051 meters) in length and made of iron . They were known to be sold in groups of twenty in small wooden cases. Poisons typically used with these needles included greenblood oil , bloodroot , blue whinnis , shadow essence , and deathblade .</p>
