<p>The Bukhara Spires were circles of massive bronze spires erected by the Imaskari of Imaskar during their Early Dynastic period ( −7975 to −6422 DR ), at a time when they had mastered transdimensional magic.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Each was etched with an intricate runic design said to be batrachi in origin. These permanent, two-way portals allowed the rapid transportation of whole legions over vast distances in the blink of an eye.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Bukhara Spires allowed the Imaskar Empire to rapidly expand across eastern Faerûn .</p>
<p>After the Silent Death (which started in −4370 DR ) nearly destroyed Lower Imaskar, Lord Artificer Khotan created twin Spires that connected to another world where the people had no control over the arcane arts. Over the next four centuries, tens of thousands of slaves where taken from the other world. Eventually this slave population began to intermarry with the Imaskari, giving rise to the Mulan ethnicity. It was said that the Imaskari acquired the knowledge necessary to travel to other worlds from interactions with the le Shay of ancient Sarifal , and indeed, there existed Bukhara Spires in the Highlands above Sarifal's capital city .</p>
