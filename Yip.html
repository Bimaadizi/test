<p>Yip was a madman in Phlan in 1489 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Yip used to live in a village near Phlan. One day in 1489 DR a disaster hit his village and he was the only survivor. He arrived in the city blabbering incoherent words about a dracolich . Aleyd Burral of the Knights of the Black Fist noticed him and somehow managed to take him to the temple of Kelemvor , where the priests took care of him. Later, the high priest Yovir Glandon hired an adventuring party to investigate the matter.</p>
