<p>The River Pelauvir , also called The River of Ice , was a cold river in the far north of the Moonsea region.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The river arose in the Tortured Land and flowed eastwards across the desolate tundra just below the Great Glacier . The only bridge known to cross the Pelauvir was Maram's Span at Frozen Flindyke .</p>
<p>At a point some 50 miles east of Flindyke, the Pelauvir was joined by the Shattersoul River , which drained down from the Great Glacier. The Pelauvir then continued heading eastwards until it reached the northern edge of Mirror Lake in the far northwestern edges of Vaasa .</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>Ice toads were known to be found in and along the river.</p>
