<p>Cooshee , also known as elven hounds , were a breed of hounds that were kept by elves .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cooshee were rather large dogs, almost as big as a pony with a height of 2 feet (0.61 meters) at the shoulder, with huge forepaws that sported long claws for a dog . They sported thick green coats of fur with brown spots. Their claws were curved, allowing them better traction in the forest grounds they typically roamed, and they had ears that pointed straight up. Their tails were of a curved nature, always held high, except when being scolded. On average they weighed around 168​ to ​200 pounds (76.2​ to ​91 kilograms).</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>These creatures had a level of intellect comparable to most dogs, but they had very independent spirits and were generally distrustful of creatures that weren't elves or half-elves . They were also highly protective of their offspring.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Cooshee were quite agile, were skilled at moving silently, and had barks that could be heard from over 1 mile (1,600 meters) away or potentially even further. Though they typically only barked in order to warn their masters or packmates. In addition, the green coloration of their coats coupled with their skill at moving silently made cooshee adept at hiding within brush or woodlands.</p>
<h3>Magical</h3>
<p>Much like their elven masters, cooshee had some form of magical resistance against enchantment spells and were immune to sleep effects. They also seemed to share the elven affinity for nature.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>These creatures were quite effective fighters. When engaging someone in combat, cooshee often tried to knock them down with their large forepaws before biting at them. These bites were said to be bone-crushing, capable of felling an orc warrior . If ordered to subdue an opponent, they would simply close their jaws over the target's throat, resting their teeth against its skin.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was uncertain whether cooshee were a naturally occurring species, or one that had been bred into existence by elves.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>In the wild these creatures were either found solitarily or in packs numbering five to twelve members. Cooshee mated for life and pups bonded strongly with their parents.</p>
<p>Cooshee had long lifespans, commonly living for up to a hundred years.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Cooshee were typically found in the same temperate, meadows and woodlands as elves.</p>
<p>In the nation of Aglarond , these beasts could be found in the wilds of the Yuirwood forest. Beyond Toril , cooshee could be found on the planet of Oerth .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Cooshee were most commonly kept by wild elves as guard or hunting dogs, though occasionally high elves also kept them. They tended to avoid the company of other species of canine.</p>
<p>Cooshee were trained as guard dogs by the Ulondarr clan of elves from Semberholme .</p>
<p>Some elven rangers had cooshee as animal companions . And some hound masters worked with them. They also sometimes acted as servants of the Seldarine deities Rillifane Rallathil and Solonor Thelandira .</p>
<h3>Usages</h3>
<p>Elven hound pups could sell for around 150 gold pieces , while a fully trained adult hound could fetch at least 300 gold pieces. However, cooshee in general were rarely ever found for sale on the open market.</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>The Skinwalkers of Evermeet were known to sometimes assume the form of cooshee as their totem animals.</p>
