<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before the town of Reithwin was consumed by the shadow-curse in the late 14 th century DR, the pair of rings was used as wedding rings by a Sharran cleric named Miranda and her unwitting lover. She performed the wedding ceremony herself and gave her new husband True Love's Embrace the morning before a great battle. As the battle raged, Miranda slew a troop of Harpers whilst suffering not a scratch. Meanwhile, the cleric's husband found himself bleeding, sporting mysterious wounds, and lost consciousness. When Miranda returned, she tried to convince the groom not to seek medical aid at Reithwin's House of Healing . Despite her insistence, the man traveled to the hospital the following day. After being examined, the Sisters of the House of Healing recognized the Sharran ring and attempted to send the man home untreated. However, soon after, both newlyweds perished in the shadow-curse that consumed the land. By the late 15 th century DR, True Love's Embrace was still worn by the skeletal remains of the husband, found in the House of Healing, and True Love's Caress was still on the Sharran priestess's dead body.</p>
