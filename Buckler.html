<p>A buckler , also known as a target shield , was a small shield useful as a defense in melee combat. Due to its small size, a buckler was of limited use in defending against missiles.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bucklers could be made from various objects. Fighting clerics could strap a field brazier to their arm to serve as a buckler. The eladrin wizard Caelynna used a clamshell as a buckler. Ironwood saw usage throughout much of the Sword Coast , as the material made for very durable and lighter weight bucklers. And in Zakhara , many daraqs (Zakharan bucklers) were made from tortoise shells.</p>
