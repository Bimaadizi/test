<p>Nereids were a race of aquatic fey related to the tritons . Like the nymphs who lived in the coves and streams, the dryads who lived in the trees, and the oreads who dwelt in the mountains, nereids were fey who were bound to the seas and oceans. They physically resembled tritons except that their bodies displaced light, making them nearly transparent and hard to see, especially when they were in the water.</p>
