<p>Mumpo was a kobold from the Dragon's Rest cloister in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mumpo once stole a copper piece from the hoard of the cloister's elder, Runara . He firmly believed she was clueless, but unbeknownst to him, she was well aware and chose to find humor in his ignorance. This strengthened his belief in his own courage.</p>
<p>Circa the Year of the Grinning Halfling, 1481 DR , Mumpo shared with three other kobolds a small monastic cell in the Dragon's Rest cloister cut into the cliff face. Each of the four slept on individual hammocks. Just like all the other kobolds, he worked at night because of their sensitivity to sunlight.</p>
