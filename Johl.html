<p>Johl had two siblings, a brother Demir and sister Mayrina .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Johl's sister was devastated in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , when her husband Connor died.

<p>The two brothers followed Mayrina's trail to the wetlands and managed to confront the old woman Ethel before she made it her shack.</p>
