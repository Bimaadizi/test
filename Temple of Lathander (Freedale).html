<p>The Temple of Lathander in the small town of Freedale in the Dalelands was a grand structure dedicated to the Morninglord that offered spiritual and divine services to the townies and adventurers alike.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple stood one door down from the home of Sethel the Scribe , followed by the West Wind Stables .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The temple was a grand white marble structure with its first level being a huge open-air shrine encircled with a green roof, while the second and third stories were topped with a steepled green-tiled roof.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Temple of Lathander offered standard services, similar to countless other shrines across the realms: curing sicknesses (250 gp ) and poison (200 gp), removing curses (500 gp), and raising dead (starting at 1000 gp), although Farrish could not raise elves . All profits were considered to be donations to the temple. The priests of the temple also accepted magic items as donations for their services. As the temple of Lathander was located in a tiny town, the priests needed to send a runner to Shadowdale to retrieve scrolls of resurrection .</p>
<p>The temple routinely refused aid to any visitors of evil nature but offered good travelers a place to spend the night if they were down on their luck and needed shelter.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The temple was built and run by a kind elderly priest called Farrish the Priest in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<p>Farrish's apprentice cleric of Lathander, Lordan the Pure , also resided in the temple when he was not out adventuring with his fellow party.</p>
