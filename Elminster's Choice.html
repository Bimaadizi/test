<p>Elminster's Choice was served at the Friendly Arm inn for a single gold coin .</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>One of the more popular beers supplied by Aurora's, it was favored by adventurers active around the Wyvernwater in Cormyr.</p>
<p>It remained unclear if Elminster actually favored this beer (he was reputed to drink anything that could be counted as alcohol) or if it was a simple marketing ploy by those who brewed it. In fact, in a footnote in Volo's Guide to Cormyr , Elminster claimed he located the man who took his name for the beer and threatened, and possibly even punished, him with being transformed into a stone toadstool for eighty years. After this, he forgave him and enlisted his aid in certain matters. Elminster called it "second-rate" and an insult. Revising his opinion in later years, he confided to Gerana on the world of Adenthia that "'tis not really my kind of drink at all."</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Elminster's Choice was served at a reception for the Merchants' Guild held in the Sheaf of Wheat inn in Ghars , Cormyr, on Eleint 19 in the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR . Jasper suspected Mayor Tobald had drunk several mugs of either Elminster's Choice or Suzale .</p>
<p>Circa 1368 DR , the gnome bard Heino kept a stock of the Elminster's Choice wine and spent much of it on getting information out of a minor Thayan official.</p>
<p>On the world of Adenthia , whilst celebrating defeating a returned Sammaster with a local adventurer named Gerana at the Wolf Keep tavern, Elminster declared a wine "the true Elminster's Choice".</p>
