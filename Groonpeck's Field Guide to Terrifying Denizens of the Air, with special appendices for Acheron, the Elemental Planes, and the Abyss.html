<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>Groonpeck's Field Guide was a voluminous tome that collected information on various dangerous avian creatures, including those found in various Elemental planes and the dreaded Abyss . Each entry in the book was accompanied by a well-drawn illustration of the beast, including such obscure creatures as firebirds â€”distant relatives of phoenixes .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1217 DR, Lorenzo Utrelli Da Lomarta and his love interest Princess Milianna Mannicci da Sumbria were able to identify a strange huge seemingly intelligent bird they befriended by accident. The huge bright orange-plumed beast named Tekorriikii was a firebird, a "sacred, untouchable, and extremely dangerous" beast to be avoided at all cost.</p>
