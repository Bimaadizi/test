<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Obarskyr family originally rose to prominence in Impiltur as a mercenary company.</p>
<p>One member of the family, Ondeth , fleeing the political situation and plague in his homeland, took his wife and two sons to a forest to the west of Marsember known as the Wolf Woods in the Year of the Firestars, 6 DR , and built a settlement. More men joined him and when the elves in the region realized they could not contain the growing number of humans invading the land they chose Ondeth to attempt to bring peace and slow down the settlement's expansion. When Ondeth died, his son Faerlthann became the first king of the realm that the elves and Ondeth had created. In the Year of Opening Doors, 26 DR (year 1 of Cormyr Reckoning ), Cormyr was born.</p>
