<p>Gathlarue (also known as Gathlarue the Wonder Wizard) was a Zhentarim wizard of the mid-14 th century DR . She kept her gender a secret from the rest of the Zhentarim.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She sounded older than her apprentices.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Gathlarue was dissatisfied by her apprentices.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>She carried a ring of teleportation , until Tespril , her apprentice, filched it. At the time of her death, she wore a dark robe. She also wore an amulet that protected her against all poisons, almost certainly a periapt of proof against poison .</p>
<p>She also bore a scrying element, a round sphere of crystal, through which she saw not just events but also thoughts to which she responded, strongly implying it was almost certainly a crystal ball with detect thoughts .</p>
<p>Gathlarue carried a number of enchanted rings that glowed blue when activated; those were destroyed soon after. She controlled gargoyles through such rings.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>She could cloak herself in a male disguise with her Art. She also knew of a blood spell that had bound her apprentices to her, letting her sift their thoughts at will.</p>
<p>Amongst other spells, she knew one to make herself capable of flight, almost certainly fly , one to arrest her falls, almost certainly feather fall , and a spell that created barriers capable of blocking spellfire which her apprentice Tespril knew as a "forcewall", almost certainly a wall of force . One of her spells allowed her to control darkenbeasts , almost certainly create darkenbeast . She could send visions to distant people.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Her apprentices were Tespril and Mairara , the latter being also the eldest. She was intimate with both, and in fact often engaged in sadomasochistic play.</p>
<p>She avoided Karkul Memrimmon , and was aware of the goings-on around the search for spellfire. Amongst other things, she was aware of the deceits of Ghaubhan Szaurr .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point, Gathlarue had explored Myth Drannor , where she'd found a portal atop a roofless tower leading to a hidden redoubt, where she'd discovered numerous spellbooks, likely including wall of force . In 1357 DR , she joined the hunt for spellfire after participating in the meeting in which Sarhthor and Manshoon explained the hunt for Shandril Shessair.</p>
<p>Throughout the hunt, she scried on Shandril constantly. Later on, she sent a darkenbeast after Shandril's party. She later employed magic to send visions to Ramath , while scrying on Ghaubhan Szaurr, whom she hoped to send after Shandril.</p>
<p>She decided to attack finally at Irondrake Rock . During the attack, she sent waves of gargoyles before attacking herself; her attack was short-lived, and unsuccessful. She protected herself from the spellfire with a wall of force or similar spell, but by attacking the cliff atop her, Shandril was able to bury her under rock.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Per Fzoul Chembryl , Gathlarue wanted the Brotherhood ruled by women instead of men, and he was aware and dismissive of her disguised gender.</p>
