<p>Ojimne was an island located in Kozakura .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ojimne was located to the southwest of Tenmei . The island was a dark pinnacle of sharp rocks amidst treacherous eddies and unpredictable currents. Navigating the passage between Tenmei and Ojimne was particularly hazardous.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Ojimne was uninhabited and lacked sources of both food or water.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In pursuit of enlightenment, the ancient sage Kaure embarked on a perilous journey by allowing himself to be stranded on Ojimne, despite the great risk posed to the boat that carried him. Astonishingly, when the boat returned to retrieve him a month later, Kaure was still alive.</p>
<p>Subsequently, in the town of Renkyu , Kaure was observed selling a small assortment of valuable and diverse items. These included ancient coins , precious gemstones , and a peculiar wakizashi , all of which he had acquired during his time on the island. However, he adamantly refused to disclose how he had come into possession of these treasures. Kaure never set foot on Ojimne again and steadfastly evaded any discussion regarding his sojourn there. Other brave souls who ventured to explore the island either failed to approach it safely or vanished into obscurity following their landing, their fates remaining unknown.</p>
