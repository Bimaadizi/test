<p>Jimn was a human harbormaster at the docks of Neverwinter on the Sword Coast North in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 1490s DR, the fleeing Lord Forge Fitzwilliam ordered Jimn—or, as he called him, "harbormaster person"—to ready a ship to give chase to his treasure ship, which had been stolen by Edgin Darvis , Holga Kilgore , Doric , Simon Aumar , and Kira . However, Jimn was more distracted by the sight of Sofina invoking the horn of beckoning death above the Neverwinter arena and, in any case, that treasure ship drifted out of control back into port, crashing into a boat and no doubt giving poor Jimn more concerns.</p>
