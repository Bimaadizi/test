<p>Heartwarders were the specialty priests devoted to goddess Sune . Heartwarders followed the teachings of Lady Firehair by encouraging love and enjoyment of all things in life. They were considered the high priests of Sunite temples, working above the Heartwardens.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Heartwarders often served wealthy patrons in the great cities found throughout the Realms. They in turn were aided in their efforts help bring together men and women seeking love and intimacy, as well as to bring pure pleasure through art, music, and other enjoyable pursuits.</p>
<p>They often worked as matchmakers, etiquette instructors, artists, or teachers in a myriad of creative disciplines, such as: visual arts, dance and performance art, vocal and instrumental music, personal beautification, and social etiquette.</p>
<p>Sometimes, heartwarders were forced to take a less peaceful route and directly oppose all forms of cruelty and tyranny. Although heartwarders did not relish battle, they accepted that sometimes the passion associated with beauty and joy could not be preserved by other means. When combat arose they typically chose to shield others from harm rather than fight.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Because of Sune's love of joy and distaste for violence, many of the abilities learned and used by heartwarders avoided direct harm, but rather focused on charming opponents or healing allies. Their opponents often felt remorse and subsequent reluctance engaging them in battle. They inspired confidence in their friends and allies, granting them the same innate charisma and magnetism that came with the worship of Sune.</p>
<p>Through divine grace, heartwarders' tears can be magically changed into the waters of evergold , water that was holy to Sunites. This solution was deadly to opponents that suffered from a particular vulnerability. With more experience, heartwarders could also use their tears to make a love potion valued highly by the faithful.</p>
<p>Through Sune's touch, heartwarders could heal others as their own flesh is mended.</p>
<p>Some heartwarders could charge their kiss with rapturous power, bringing sensations of complete pleasure to any she bestowed it upon. This kiss blessed those it touched, granting them increased resistance against magical effects for a short duration. A heartwarder's kiss was so potent that it sometimes confused and dazed the recipient. The similar prayer known as Sune's kiss filled an opponent with overwhelming infatuation, causing their morale to decline with each blow they saw the heartwarder take.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, heartwarders could also kiss those who were at a distance by means of a unique spell. Other spells granted to them by Sune included: charm person , rapture , emotion , and flame strike .</p>
<p>Another prayer used by heartwarders was siren voice , which helped hone their voice into a sweet and enchanting sound that weakened the will of their enemies, in turn placing them under enchantment.</p>
<p>So great was the love heartwarders had for their fellow allies, that their divine power could absorb some of the harm caused to them. While it reduced the lethality of an attack, it hurt the heartwarder in turn.</p>
<p>Other abilities are less common among heartwarders. Though all heartwarders rely heavily on their innate charisma, some heartwarders are so confident in their own abilities of persuasion and strength of belief that they inspire this same confidence in others, increasing their personal charm and strength of personality.</p>
<p>With advanced training a heartwarder could achieve perfect union with the ideals of their goddess, becoming a personification of beauty by mortal standards. At this point a heartwarder became a creature of the fey , along with all their inherent strengths.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
