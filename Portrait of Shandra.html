<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , gnomish painter Pepin Pollo traveled from the City of Splendors, Waterdeep to the Jewel of North, Neverwinter , where he made coin by painting portraits of those who could pay for the service. One day, the person who would later be known as Knight-Captain came across the diminutive artist. Shandra Jerro was one of Kalach-Cha's new companions, and her beauty instantly captivated Pepin. The painter shooed away the woman whose portrait he was working on and immediately began creating the Portrait of Shandra . From his inspiration was born a beautiful and masterful painting Pollo called his masterpiece. The Knight-Captain purchased the painting for Shandra; however, it left her possession soon after when Shandra was murdered by her grandfather – the infamous warlock Ammon Jerro .</p>
