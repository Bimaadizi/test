<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point, the older brother of Sparkle's owner— Russell Roland , a member of the city's Council of Lords —spread a rumor throughout Ravens Bluff with the help of the magic-user Grimalkin the Sage that claimed the housecat was actually a basilisk that had been polymorphed . Russell's motivation for spreading this rumor was a desire to discourage strangers from bothering his young sister.</p>
