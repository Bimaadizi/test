<p>Thukmuul Teleshann was a magister of Mystra at the Tower of Balance in Silverymoon in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1366 DR , Thukmuul ended one of his religious services by announcing Eriladar Leafsigil as his successor before leaving the Tower. He was seen quickly pacing towards the Moonbridge , before eventually disappearing in a flash of emerald colored light once he reached its highest point. Some noted that his manner of disappearance was similar to that of the High Mage Orjalun .</p>
<p>In the years that followed some attempted to inquire with Mystra about Thukmuul's whereabouts or activities, but such efforts proved fruitless.</p>
