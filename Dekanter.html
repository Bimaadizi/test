<p>Dekanter ( pronounced : / d ɛ ˈ k ɑː n t ɛ r / de-KANT-er ), formally the Mines of Dekanter , were ruins found beneath the Graypeak Mountains in the Savage Frontier .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Dekanter was once a mine of Netheril . It has since fallen into ruin. The legacy of Netheril remains within the ruins as the dangerous side effects of powerful spellcasting.</p>
<p>Dekanter's main chamber was built as an enormous amphitheater built to giant -sized scale. The center of the bowl-shaped cavern was about 0.5 mi (0.8 km) wide, surrounded by five receding levels each at least 20 ft (6.1 m) high and just as much wide. Human -sized stairs crisscrossed the tiers all the way up to their uppermost level.</p>
<p>Side chambers in the mines were marked by Dethek inscriptions, and decorated with grand paintings depicting scenes from the oldest epic stories of the Realms. The tunnels that interconnected these chambers were difficult to navigate and nearly impossible to map out, as every rainfall caused some of them to close down or collapse, while others became open.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Dekanter was located west of Anauroch and to the south of Weathercote Wood in the eastern foothills of the Graypeak Mountains . The crumbling ruins were surrounded by low hills. As of the mid–14 th century DR , the Dawn Pass Trail passed through the Graypeaks near the entrance of the mines. As of the 15 th century DR, it lay on the western border of the reborn Empire of Netheril.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>The ruins of Dekanter was home to beholders , gargoyles , gnolls and goblins .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In −2758 DR , Dekanter , a Netherese miner, discovered a massive deposit of gold , iron , mercury , platinum and silver . Netheril quickly established the mines of Dekanter, named after its discoverer. Dekanter was an incredibly successful mine, triggering the beginning of the Silver Age of Netheril . It provided Netheril with a significant amount of their mineral resources.</p>
<p>By −1658 DR , all the minerals were extracted and it became a sort of laboratory for Netherese mages. Since the mine was able to isolate the potentially negative effects of a spell, it was used as a testing ground for new spells. It was also used as a storage facility for magical items. It was abandoned with the fall of Netheril .</p>
<p>For centuries war was waged within Dekanter between different factions of goblinoid communities. The severity of these conflicts ebbed and flowed throughout the years.</p>
<p>During the Era of Upheaval , beginning in the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR , the war within Dekanter spilled out beyond the mines into the surrounding mountains. Around this time they were were also used as a site for the Zhentarim to conduct their slave trade. Within ten years, the war had become out of control, spilling out into the surrounding mountains and sending hundreds of goblin refugees to nearby human settlements.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , a group of travelers ventured into Dekanter and recovered one of the fabled Nether Scrolls from the clutches of the mysterious cult leader that took over as ruler of the ruins' goblin population.</p>
<p>The lure of lost Netherese magic meant that the mines remained a draw for adventurers well into the late 15 th century DR despite the many dangers.</p>
