<p>The Kaliesh'erai was an organization of psionic elves based in the city of Evereska in the Western Heartlands .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The majority of the members spent their time in serene mediation and contemplation of their powers, but there were some who'd grown fascinated by psionic items . They sought to acquire any such items they could, and gladly bought or bartered them from visitors to Evereska. Thus Evereska was a good place to find a buyer for a psionic curiosity. The Kaliesh'erai were thus the most prolific collectors of psionic lore in the surface lands, and likely only second to the illithids in the Underdark .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Hall of the Kaliesh'erai in Evereska was the headquarters of the organization. A subbasement area contained a number of laboratories and vaults holding the group's collection of psionic items. This represented the largest collection of psionic lore and knowledge in Faerûn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thanks to their long elven life-spans, many members of the Kaliesh'erai had spent centuries training their minds and practicing their psychic powers, making them the top experts in psionic lore by 1373 DR .</p>
<p>However, in the mid-1370s DR, one young member, Reliath Crescentia , robbed the Hall of a number of powerful items. The theft triggered huge debates among the remaining members, which came to focus on the future of the Kaliesh'erai and led to a schism between older conservative and younger expansionist elements.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Kaliesh'erai was but a loose association of elves of similar interests but they had dissimilar views. While many simply contemplated and cultivated their powers, one faction was fascinated with psionic items instead.</p>
<p>By 1374 DR , the Kaliesh'erai had also undergone something of a schism into conservative and expansionist contingents, triggered by Crescentia's theft. The former, comprising older members led by Theldir Whitemoon , preferred seclusion and separation from the outer, non-elven world. The latter, the younger elves following Dalthoeneir Delthoenoth , desired contact with non-elven psionicists, and perhaps even allow them to join the Kaliesh'erai.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The Kaliesh'erai only accepted elves or half-elves who could demonstrate some psionic capability and were knowledgeable in psionic lore or powers or skilled in autohypnosis.</p>
<p>Members were mostly psions and wilders . In 1374 DR , there were 55 members: 25 moon elves , 15 sun elves , 5 wood elves , 2 wild elves , 6 half-elves , 1 avariel , and 1 celadrin . None were evil .</p>
<p>The organization required dues of a tithe (that is, 10%) of member's earnings. In return, members received psionic training and favored members enjoyed a 15% discount on services of a psionic nature from other members.</p>
<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>The Hall of the Kaliesh'erai was rumored to contain cells holding imprisoned psionic monsters—such as couatl , rakshasa , or yuan-ti —that were being studied by the members.</p>
