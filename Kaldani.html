<p>Kaldani was a tiefling that lived in Elturel during the late 15 th century DR , before she was forced out of the city alongside the others of her kind.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She held archdruid Halsin in high esteem, but did not care for the mercenary leader Aradin that the elven druid hired as a guide.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the city of Elturel was pulled down to the Nine Hells in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Kaldani and the other tieflings were kicked out of the city. Led by Zevlor , the stalwart former member of the Hellriders , the group traveled west for a time, before settling at the Emerald Grove druidic sanctuary. Like many of them, Kaldani became very worried when the grove's leader Halsin went missing, fearing for their safety in his absence.</p>
