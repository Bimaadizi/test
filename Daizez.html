<p>Daizez was a dwarf historian of Clangeddin's Hearth , an organization of descendants of Clan Melairkyn who were attempting to reclaim their ancestral homes in Undermountain in 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Daizez's written work, A Brief History of Undermountain , was instrumental in assembling the dwarves who would become Clangeddin's Hearth. The book was written shortly after Halaster Blackcloak 's disappearance from Underdark in 1369 DR and called the nationalistic and religious dwarves to reclaim the ancient territories and holy grounds of Clan Melairkyn. The campaign was cut short in 1370 DR , when most members of Clangeddin's Hearth were slaughtered by Matron Azurna 's drow troops. It was very likely Daizez was one of the fallen.</p>
