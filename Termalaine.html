<p>Termalaine was the second-northernmost settlement of Ten Towns , and the third largest in the region in the 1300s. It was thought to be the gem of Icewind Dale ; a charming little village surrounded by striking natural beauty. As delightful as it was, the town maintained a bitter fishing rivalry with the walled settlement of Targos . The city gets its name from tourmaline mining.</p>
<p>It was home to a great many craftspeople and shipwrights, whose work was placed on display with the fleet of fishing vessels that were owned by the town.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Termalaine was located on the eastern shore of Maer Dualdon , due north of Bryn Shander .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The long-standing councilman of the mid-14 th century DR was Agorwal , owner of the tourmaline gem mine. He was injured and survived the orc invasion sent by Akar Kessell in the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR , and later died in the battle of Bryn Shander .</p>
<p>Speaker Shaelen Masthew served as the head of Termalaine during the late 15 th century. She was a charming and shrewd woman who greatly admired her fellow council member Duvessa Shane .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Termalaine's main rival was Targos , and their feuds for fishing rights on Maer Dualdon from time to time ended in bloodshed.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Historically, the area was rich in tourmaline mining. A nearby cave provided the source of these valuable gems .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>In time of war, the city could call upon around 100 to 500 human militia who fought with dwarven weapons and wore lightweight armor.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1342 DR , goblins raided Termalaine. Were it not for the intervention of Clan Battlehammer , the town may have been destroyed.</p>
<p>The city of Termalaine was taken over several times by barbarian forces. The infamous barbarian Heafstaag had previously conquered it twice, but failed a third. During his last attempt, in the Year of the Crown, 1351 DR , Heafstaag and his allies tried to conquer all of the Ten Towns in one massive attack.</p>
<p>The attack by the Tribe of the Bear during the Battle of Icewind Dale forced more than half the townsfolk to take shelter in Bryn Shander , but the damage was quickly repaired.</p>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Termalaine fell victim to an unnatural blizzard that drove all of its residents out to seek shelter in the larger towns of Bryn Shander and Taros . At the time, the Eastside's tavernkeep stayed behind to ensure his establishment wouldn't get sacked by a gang of verbeeg led by Slabhead , who took over the town once it was emptied of its inhabitants. When the inn was broken into by monsters, the keeper hid in the cellar and stayed alive until the Hero of Neverwinter and their allies broke the occupation with spell and sword. Two day's before the Hero arrived, the famed defender of the Dale, Wulfgar arrived to the frozen town, but was bested by Slabhead's master, the man known as Iceblood . The blue-skinned shaman turned Wulfgar into an ice-statue and trapped him within an Ice Spire, erected at the heart of Termalaine. The Hero of Neverwinter managed to slay the leader of the verbeeg and, with the help of the ice mage of Hillsfar named Blizzard , returned Wulfgar back to the living state.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>One of the quietest and most beautiful of the settlements in Icewind Dale, Termalaine had sprawling tree plantings around the widely scattered houses, which were placed behind rubble walls to protect the structures against the wind.</p>
