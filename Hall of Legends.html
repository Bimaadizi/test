<p>The Hall of Legends was a great and mysterious castle lying somewhere high in the Yehimal Mountains of the Utter East of southeast Faerûn . All that mortals knew of it was the outer walls and its entrance, the Gate of Immortals , for within was the realm of the Immortals.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Hall of Legends was set inside a peak erupting out of a vast plateau of heavily cracked ice or white stone, which dropped off in steep cliffs to the south. Green plants grew and pushed through the cracks. Nothing else grew here.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Gate of Immortals was a massive and ornately decorated set of golden doors, set within an arch seemingly leading into the peak. Beyond it lay the Hall of Legends itself, in the realm of Immortals. All that follows is its defenses.</p>
<p>Surrounding the peak and the Gate of Immortals was an impenetrable, indestructible "wind wall", named for the powerful winds that blew up from them and beat back all flying creatures that tried to go over them. They were built of big gray stone blocks and topped with battlements, with crenellations marked with a crossed-circle symbol.</p>
<p>The path to the Gate was a long and narrow avenue between two parallel, immensely thick wind walls. Atop these walls were platforms for defenders to stand upon. The last two platforms, flanking the Gate, supported two full-size golden statues of the guardian defenders, while two more statues stood on ledges on the peak itself. These platforms were interspaced with ornate domes of unknown purpose. At the end of the avenue, the front ends of the wind walls bore relief carvings of a howling face surrounded by swirls (presumably a depiction of the source of the wind) over a winged figure wrestling a bull by the horns.</p>
<p>Between these walls, the avenue was blocked by four small gate houses, each topped by a dome. Behind each of were six portal platforms that could summon guardians. It was up this gauntlet that all attacking armies were forced to advance.</p>
<p>Lying in front of the main entrance was the vast Well of Immortals. Resembling a much, much larger portal platform of intricate design, its central ring was decorated with various designs, including, in gold, the holy symbols of the deities Chauntea , Myrkul , Tempus , Lathander , and Mystra . Within was a circle of shimmering pink and purple energy. It was described as an "energy spring that conducts power from all sources". Basal golems placed here could transform just as they would at a sacred shrine on a mystical site , but the form they took was random; in effect, the Well of Immortals seemed to function as a sacred shrine to all the represented deities.</p>
<p>Around the Well of Immortals were four more portal platforms of the smaller design. They would also summon reinforcements in the form of guardians.</p>
<p>In the northeast and northwest corners were sites for bloodforges of opposing forces. On the plateau outside the walls were arrayed a variety of temple-like structures, all built of columns, from small blue-gray square shrines to large golden-tiled peak-roofed rectangular halls to dread gazebos.</p>
<h2>Defenders</h2>
<p>The Gate of Immortals was defended by an unidentified bloodforge mage commanding an army of basal golems and their advanced forms, usually chosen at random upon the Well of Immortals. An existing force of rangers and wizards stood upon platforms on the wind walls and attacked approaching forces with arrows and lightning darts. Further defenders could be summoned via portals.</p>
<p>However, the guardians were by far the mightiest defenders. These were bronze-skinned giants who hurled divine flame and were nigh-invulnerable to all assaults. Six at a time were summoned behind every gatehouse in the avenue leading up to the Gate of Immortals. It was said they barred the way to all but the most worthy of battle-hardened warriors. And there was only one to test this.</p>
<p>Guardians were summoned from the realm of Immortals via the portals. These were shimmering circles of pink and purple energy set horizontally in ornate platforms or daises. The guardians erupted from these amidst green flames. Passage was one way, and the portals deactivated once they'd been used.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the time of the Bloodforge Wars ( 648 – 657 DR ), the leader of the Legendary Campaign conquered the whole Utter East , suppressed all conflicts, and unified and ruled the realms as overlord. Finally, at the end of their reign, this leader was destined to fight another great battle, this time at the Gate of Immortals.</p>
<p>In a lengthy bloodforge battle, the leader of the Legendary Campaign defeated the opposing army, breached all the lesser gates one by one, and defeated all the guardians. Finally, they broke through the Gate of Immortals into the Hall of Legends, and became an Immortal themselves.</p>
