<p>Grazilaxx was a mind flayer member of the Society of Brilliance during the late 1480s or early 1490s DR.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Grazilaxx once had an arrangement with the lich Zarifrax wherein Zarifrax would rip the souls from his captives and then give their bodies to Grazilaxx to eat their brains. It eventually founded and joined the Society of Brilliance; having done so alongside Blurg , Omeluum , Sloopidoop , Y , and Skriss .</p>
<p>Grazilaxx and all the other members of the Society of Brilliance went on a pilgrimage to Gravenhollow some years before the demonic crisis that struck the Underdark in the late 1480s DR .</p>
<p>During the late phase of the crisis, Grazilaxx surprisingly helped Regis and Drizzt Do'Urden in fighting the demon lord Demogorgon near Mantol-Derith .</p>
