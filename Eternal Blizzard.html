<p>The Eternal Blizzard was a notable valley within the Ice Spires .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Eternal Blizzard was situated along the east bank of the Clear Whirl River , between the western and northern arms of the Ice Spires. Northeast of this valley was the Hill giant camp of Chief Groote .</p>
<p>On the far side of the Eternal Blizzard was the Dour Fissure .</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>The location's name was derived from its peculiar state of perpetual whiteout. This phenomenon was caused by the surrounding mountains trapping any wind moving over the valley from the west, which forced them into a swirling torrent that engulfed the entire region and churned its snow. These winds typically averaged 40 mi (64,000 m) per hour and rarely dropped below 30 mi (48,000 m).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Ice Spire ogres were known to banish members of their tribe into the Eternal Blizzard, either for acts of betrayal or for violating their leaders' authority.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The Eternal Blizzard's unique phenomenon sparked many local myths and rumors over time. One legend claimed that a furious deity of snow lived within its center, while another told of a powerful tanar'ri being trapped within the gap by Uthgar or Hiatea .</p>
<p>One rumor alleged that many of the Ice Spire ogres who were banished into the Eternal Blizzard had somehow survived. Supposedly, they had formed a sort of feral society that relied upon raiding human caravans and stealing from the various nearby giant steadings, but were very careful to cover their tracks.</p>
