<p>Ioma was a small island in the Nelanther Isles to the west of Amn .</p>
<p>The island had only one town, Ioma Town , with a population of 800 in 1479 DR . Most of the island was occupied by a mountain of the same name, which contained a large vein of Iomic crystal at its peak.</p>
<p>By the late 15th century DR, the island had become a competitor of Skaug 's, although its port was only half as large. The island was protected by a small cadre of Cowled Wizards from Amn.</p>
