<p>The Elders of the Llewyrr , also known as the Synnorian Elders , was a collective of venerable Llewyrr elders who advised the ruler of the elven realm of Synnoria .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>They operated out of the palace of Argen-Tellirynd in the hidden city of Chrysalis . As of the 14 th and 15 th centuries DR , the Elders advised and were presided over by the Serene Matriarch, Ate`Niah . They served to represent their people's millennia-old traditions, and weighed in on matters of whether Synnoria should involve itself in the affairs of human and elven realms beyond their borders.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR , the Elders were rattled by the appearance of the Elf-Eater . Despite the assistance of Alicia and Robyn Kendrick , the Elders were staunchly opposed to offering the humans any aid in their own quest to rescue High King Tristan Kendrick from the scrags of the Coral Kingdom . This position put them at odds with the Sisters of Synnoria .</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>A Llewyrr could be admitted to the Elders only once they had lived a minimum of six centuries. They valued tradition and tended to embody the isolationist and racial arrogance of the Llewyrr. They warned against humans' efforts to trap the Llewyrr in their intrigues.</p>
<p>As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, the venerable sage Erashanoor was a spokesperson for the Elders.</p>
