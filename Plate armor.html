<p>Plate armor (also known variously as plate mail, field plate, full plate, or simply plate ) was a type of armor used on Toril . It made up a wide variety of different heavy armor designs that covered the entire body.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Plate armor consisted of shaped, solid plates that covered various parts of body. It was supplemented by chain armor that covered any gaps, and beneath the metal was a thick layer of padding. The whole suit was held together with numerous straps and harnesses to distribute the weight.</p>
<p>Many of the pieces that made up a set of plate had their own distinct names, such as the couter (elbow guard), pauldron (shoulder guard), rerebrace (upper-arm guard), vambrace (forearm guard), and gorget (throat-plate).</p>
<p>Plate was often the heaviest type of armor available, sacrificing mobility and agility for superior protection.</p>
<h2>Variations</h2>
<p>Plate armor was among the most expensive and heavy armor a warrior could buy. The different types each had their own advantages and drawbacks to their designs.</p>
