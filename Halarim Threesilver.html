<p>Halarim Threesilver was a bard from Sembia who was most notable for having recovered the third volume of A Harper's Companion , a series of songbooks.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Halarim was the fourth child of six, and the youngest son, in a moderately wealthy Sembian family who ran jewelry shops. As he grew up, he realized that his older brothers would inherit the family business, and he took up the harp , despite lacking natural musical talent.</p>
<p>Halarim made his way to Waterdeep , where he met a female wizard who invited him to join her companions, a dwarf and half-orc , to work as mercenaries. These mercenaries worked in Cormyr , Sembia, and the Western Heartlands , particularly as scouts, to provide information after the war against the Devil Dragon and the ghazneths .</p>
<p>In a letter to his family dated Eleint 21 , 1371 DR , Halarim mentioned having discovered the third volume of A Harper's Companion , a series of songbooks written around 1200 DR by the Cormyrian bard Cressaed Wood . He wrote that he intended to continue pursuing orcs in order to find their lair, with the intent of discovering other items of interest.</p>
<p>The Eleint 21, 1371 DR, letter was the final contact anyone had from Halarim, and he, along with his mercenary company, were never heard from again and presumed dead.</p>
