<p>Sand of mirages was a useful magical sand found in Zakhara , the Land of Fate, that created a deceptive image.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This sand created an illusion of whatever the user wanted barring creatures. For the illusion to work, the sand needed to be thrown outdoors under the light of the sun. A handful of sand of mirages would create an illusion that would fill a 50 foot (15 m) cube. Multiple handfuls could be combined to create larger illusions. These illusions would last as long as they remained in contact with direct sunlight. The illusions would not vanish if struck, but their true nature would be revealed.</p>
