<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the mage named Lathar thought himself a worthy opponent to a well-known archmage . He challenged the archmage to a spell-duel but not before crafting a magical belt that would protect Lathar from the archwizard's favorite death magic spells. In battle, Lathar's belt worked as intended: the archmage's fingers of death and power words did not affect the challenger in a siltiest. Overconfident in his magic belt, Lathar laughed at his opponent, mockingly challenging him to do his best. The mage did just that. He summoned a giant dire bear bear who killed the unknown mage with one bite. After that, the belt became known as Lathar's Last Belt . By the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the belt found its way into the hands of undead who claimed an unnamed burial barrow in the Neverwinter Wood .</p>
