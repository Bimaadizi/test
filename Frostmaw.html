<p>Frostmaw was a great white wyrm that plagued the frozen tundras of Icewind Dale some years before the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Frostmaw was a fearsome beast, almost as big and powerful as a true white dragon . It was slain by a ranger defender of the Ten-Towns named Kellem Longeyes some years before the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR . Even though the white wyrm perished at the ranger's weapons, it left disfiguring scars on Kellem's face, taking his eye and years with Frostmaw's icy breath. Subsequently, Frostmaw's skull was tuned into the elaborate enchanted helm Kellem Longeyes called Wyrm's Maw .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , Wyrm's Maw was recovered from a nest of two white dragons and their white wyrms in the River Caves just south of the Spine of the World, from whence the Black Raven River began and ran south across the Cold Marshes .</p>
