<p>Baeremar's Stargirt Stallion was an inn in Archtassel in Tasseldale in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This quaint and quiet inn was located in such a way it provided a great view of the tassel for guests. Guests were treated with fresh soup made every morning. The inn was known for its collection of exotic teas . If one was willing to part with their coin, they could add sweetened cocoa from Maztica to their beverage. Served with the tea were small biscuits and a selection of spreads made from butter mixed with local herbs and vegetables.</p>
<p>The inn displayed and sold items and crafts made by the residents of Archtassel. A pool behind the inn was warded against insects, allowing both guests and staff a chance to bathe or cool down in peace.</p>
<p>The inn was small and cramped, and only a dozen guests could stay at any given time. The inn did not see many travelers, locals were the primary patrons. The relief-carved sign that hung outside the inn was enchanted so the stars, which were just bumps in the wood, sparkled and twinkled.</p>
