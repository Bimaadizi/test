<p>The Eye of Justice was a religious sect in the late 14 th and 15 th centuries DR that believed in the Heresy of the Threefold God , a belief that held the gods Torm , Helm , and Tyr were one and the same. Although the church was regarded as a heresy by Torm's followers, Torm apparently granted power to some of its members.</p>
<h2>Membership</h2>
<p>The order was governed by the Council of Vigilant Seers and had few female members. By 1480 DR , many members of the Eye had abandoned the Threefold God heresy and worshiped Torm exclusively.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Streams Blooded, 1384 DR , Gedrin a young member of the Night Masks thieves guild in Westgate , had a vision in which Helm and Tyr fought, with Tyr slaying Helm. After he died, Helm's essence melded with Tyr's and Tyr's sight returned. When Gedrin woke from his vision, he held Helm's sword, Vindicator . Later, Gedrin had another vision in which Tyr was killed by the demon lord Orcus and Tyr's essence flowed into Torm's, making Torm the Threefold God. Gedrin became a religious zealot and recruited crusaders from among the Night Masks. The church was instrumental in driving the Night Masks from Westgate in the Year of the Wrathful Eye, 1391 DR .</p>
<p>Later, the church became corrupted and Gedrin left Westgate in disgust. He traveled to the Sword Coast where sometime in the 1460s DR he met a child rogue named Kalen Dren begging on the streets of Luskan . He gave Vindicator to Kalen and recruited him into the church. Kalen later became the church's primary crusader.</p>
