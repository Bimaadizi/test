<p>King Showaxe was the ruler of the dwarves who inhabited the Mountains of the Alaoreum circa 227 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>King Showaxe of Ironfang led his troops into an epic battle with a fearsome red dragon named Stormcrossing in the Year of the Raised Banner, 227 DR . King Showaxe emerged victorious in the clash and claimed the dragon's hoard. But the price of victory was steep—Stormcrossing set the dwarven town of Deepgate‎ ablaze. A column of smoke from the pyre alerted humans from the Swordslake Creek of the previously unknown dwarven presence in the Alaoreum.</p>
