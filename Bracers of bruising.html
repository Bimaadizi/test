<p>Bracers of bruising were unique enchanted bracers commissioned by the infamous Night Masks of Westgate to improve reputation of their street-level thugs.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The bracers were enchanted to increase the wearer's strength and their physical presence, making it an easy task to intimidate others.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bracers of bruising were created sometime before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , ordered to be enchanted by the leaders of the guild. The bracers were to inspire and promote cruelty amid the guild's street-level criminals. Bracers of bruising continuously changed hands for years, serving the most brattish and cruel of the Night Masks, but never the same person for long.</p>
<p>Despite the bracers' of bruising not being cursed items, wearing them was dangerous as countless street thugs wanted to claim the bracers for themselves. Everyone wanted to be the "Westgate's Biggest Thug".</p>
