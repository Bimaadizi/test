<p>Andelmaus Logging was a large logging and timber company headquartered in the city of Highmoon in the Dalelands during the late 14 th century DR . They specialized in supplying much-needed timber to the nation of Sembia , who were somewhat deprived of the naturally available resource.</p>
<p>The company was owned by an unscrupulous merchant named Kessia who would intermittently push into areas beyond where logging was allowed and put her company on probation with the local authority. She responded to this action by hiring mercenaries to guard her logging camps and warehouses.</p>
