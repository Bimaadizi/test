<p>Caddelyn's Workbook was the incomplete spellbook of the long-deceased mage Caddelyn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The spellbook had a silver -plated cover of slate, with electrum hinges, which held together sixteen sheets of parchment.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Shortly before 1359 DR , Caddelyn's Workbook was looted from his tower north of the Great Glacier by unknown forces. It was briefly recovered by the adventurer Dabron Sashenstar , who held onto it until his party camped for the night, whereupon it went missing again.</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>Caddelyn had only begun copying his magical knowledge into the workbook before his death while visiting the city of Waterdeep . Only three of the sixteen pages of the book contained his writing. The portion that was inscribed contained information for two spells of Caddelyn's creation, spell invulnerability and Caddelyn's catastrophe , as well as his notes on how to craft a magemask .</p>
