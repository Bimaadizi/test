<h2>History</h2>
<p>Reldyk Applecrown had taken some damage during the fight against Xarlandralath , but the worst of his injuries was mental after he'd been caught in some magical backlash, which had left him comatose and experiencing occassional seizures. It was in this state that Vangerdahast offered his body to Elminster, the Chosen of Mystra , who was in turn without a body after a beholder attack. With some magic, Elminster took possession of Reldyk Applecrown's body.</p>
<h2>Hosting Elminster</h2>
<p>Elminster used Reldyk Applecrown's body to accompany Lady Darlethra Greatgaunt , actually a disguised Storm Silverhand , the Marchioness Immerdusk , in her walks to and fro all over the city. He later used the same body still to pursue after Morligul Downdagger after he kidnapped one of the Lords of Waterdeep , his friend Mirt , believing him to be actually Rauligus Helderstone , whom he was impersonating at the time.</p>
<p>He continued to wear that body for a bit, until while trying to lure the blueflame ghosts to the Bold Blazon , he got caught in the crossfire after the War Wizards turned up. He bodily blocked one of Glathra Barcantle 's spells on Storm Silverhand , getting Reldyk Applecrown's body completely annihilated in the process.</p>
