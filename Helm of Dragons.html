<p>The Helm of Dragons was a potent magical item made in Myth Drannor that was forged to defeat Tyranthraxus the Flamed One but which bestowed powers over all dragonkind .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Accounts described it as a gold circlet, despite its name. On its brow was a green-hued gem, inside which was the image of a dragon standing upon its hind legs.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>On donning the Helm of Dragons , the wearer learned of its powers.</p>
<p>Its primary, and highly specific, power was to locate the pool of radiance in which Tyranthraxus dwelled. This functioned up to 500 miles (800 kilometers) away. Moreover, it granted the wearer greater resistances against Tyranthraxus's magic .</p>
<p>Moreover, it also enabled the wearer to speak with all dragons in their native languages . Most significantly, however, the wearer of the Helm of Dragons was made immune to all attacks by all living dragons. ( Undead dragons, like dracoliches , did not count.)</p>
<p>However, all these powers were only active when Tyranthraxus was present on Toril . Once he was killed or banished, it fell dormant and only awakened at the Flamed One's return.</p>
<p>In any case, as a helmet, it of course also protected the wearer's head.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The elves of Myth Drannor fashioned the Helm of Dragons at the height of that city's prosperity, some time before its fall in the Year of Doom, 714 DR . Although their intent was to create an instrument with which to combat the evil entity known as Tyranthraxus, the Possessing Spirit, it was later discovered to have an array of other powers, particularly over dragons.</p>
<p>At some point, in the mid–14 th century DR , a disgraced and banished Red Wizard of Thay named Dracandros of the Crimson sought out the Helm of Dragons . He believed that by using the Helm to speak with many of the great dragons of the North he could trigger a new Flight of Dragons and devastate the Realms, all just to win glory among his old peers and be readmitted to their ranks. Dracandros made an ally of the dracolich Crimdrac and established himself in Hap , Battledale . He chased rumors, searched with magic, engaged in trickery, employed Crimdrac's minions, and finally found the Helm of Dragons .</p>
<p>Then Tyranthraxus himself contacted Dracandros, under the codename "Lord T", and invited him to join the New Alliance of the Bonds . Tyranthraxus had an ulterior motive, of course, planning for the victims of the azure bonds to bring him the Helm of Dragons , as well as the Gauntlets of Moander and Blade of Lathander , all designed to defeat him, so he might finally destroy them. Dracandros accepted, believing the New Alliance would only aid his mad scheme.</p>
<p>However, in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , following instructions from Elminster , adventurers bearing the azure bonds confronted Dracandros in his tower on Haptooth Hill . They defeated Dracandros and dealt with the dragons he was negotiating with, lifted the curse of the azure bonds , and took the Helm of Dragons . It gave them the whereabouts of Tyranthraxus so they might finish their quest, with the protection of the helm and other items.</p>
