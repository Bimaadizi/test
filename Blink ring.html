<p>A blink ring was an enchanted ring with certain magical powers.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Rings known during the Time of Troubles were plain affairs made of brass , while those found between the Spellplague and the Second Sundering were instead of adamantine , unstably shifting between hands in a blink.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Early examples, known during the Time of Troubles, could be used constantly to cast blink , invisibility , or mirror image or act as a cloak of displacement . However, it had a cool-down period of about a minute between uses, and the displacement function became inactive for about ten minutes after using any of those powers.</p>
<p>A particular blink ring belonged to Thanadar of Dragonrock , and it had instead the blink , dimension door , and teleport without error spells each available twice daily.</p>
<p>Blink rings during the period between the Spellplague and the Second Sundering referred to a kind of ring that enhanced thieving skills, and could daily be used for a minor teleportation, reaching no further than 20 feet (6.1 meters) away. It was possible to repeat successive teleportations for as long as concentration lasted, though the ring did not do an initial activation more than once a day. Users who had hit their stride and were yet to wind down from an earlier encounter could even push the ring to repeat teleportations with barely any attention involved.</p>
