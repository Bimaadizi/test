<p>Lakataki was an azer on the Elemental Plane of Fire in 1373 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lakataki was the seneschal of the azer Everash Tribe in the Elemental Plane of Fire, acting as an advisor to Lord Cripakolus . However, most of his fellows were enslaved by the efreet Hafiz al-Milhab to work in his mine.</p>
<p>Thus, in 1373 DR, when the azers captured Kaanyr Vhok and his allies, Cripakolus bargained with Kaanyr, offer to release them and show them a passage to the City of Brass in exchange for them destroying the efreet mine. Lakataki heavily supported this agreement.</p>
