<p>The Heart of Ubtao was an earthmote that hovered over the Aldani Basin in Chult . It was a sacred site for worshipers of Ubtao , the deity known as the Creator of Chult.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The earthmote earned its name from its shape that somewhat resembled a humanoid heart, with petrified tree roots that duplicated veins and arteries. Rainwater that filtered through deposits of iron became red in hue, resembling blood that dripped down to the jungle below.</p>
<p>Faithful Chultans believed it was the actual heart of their patron deity.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime during the late 15 th century DR , Valindra Shadowmantle and a group of Red Wizards settled in the Heart of Ubtao while they sought out the Chultan artifact known as the Soulmonger . She created a teleportation circle within the earthmote that linked back to the far off nation of Thay .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>While the hallow, petrified tree in the earthmote was naturally home to swarms of bats , the earthmote also housed a number of undead protectors, including a pair of zombified girallons .</p>
