<p>Corth was a fishing village on the northern coast of western Aglarond , situated on a small cove with nearby beaches of white sand.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This village was located roughly 20 miles (32,000 meters) west and southwest of Velprintalar . At the center of Corth Cove there was a craggy rock that jutted above the waves.</p>
<p>During the fall and winter, the weather around Corth became quite windy, with the coastal waters of the Easting Reach gone heavy and grey. At this time not much fishing occurred and the citizenry typically stayed indoors.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Corth boasted a small fishing fleet that brought it considerable wealth during the spring and summer seasons. Beyond just fishing , the village was a popular destination spot among Aglarondans, due to its scenic beaches and rustic atmosphere.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Corth was originally founded in 756 DR by human fisherfolk that largely came from the nation of Chessenta and the plains of Wizards' Reach .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Harper agent Mestrel Hawkmantle sailed from Lyrabar to Corth on a ship that he had bought with ill-gotten gains stolen from a crooked merchant. He carried within his cargo a mixed assortment of weapons. Once he made landfall at Corth, Mestrel contacted a merchant he suspected of being a Thayan spy, himself posing as an intel gatherer for the Red Wizards . He then fed her some false intel through a cryptic warning, saying that in Spandeliyon a group of nine archmages were concocting some sort of "super- spell " against the Red Wizards.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>As of 1368 DR , the population of Corth numbered around five hundred. Everyday dress consisted of simple brown or white tunics with minimal decoration.</p>
<p>Like other human communities in western Aglarond, the people of Corth traced their heritage back to the pirates and other outlaws that once called the region home. Among those who could afford to do so, they reflected this heritage by dressing in flamboyant clothes of contrasting, yet basic colors, such as blue and yellow or black and white. And wearing such accessories as bandannas , headbands, ear and nose rings , necklaces , and jeweled brooches.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>Corth boasted several several inns, all of them built in the rustic and rather charming style typical of Aglarond. Out of all of these, the best inn was The Mermaid's Purse , which was operated by the former fisherman Droze .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Older fishermen of Corth maintained that merfolk hold council at Corth Cove's craggy rock on nights with a full moon . However, outsiders who visited the rock would claim that this was merely a tall tale. In response to such naysayers, Corth's old folks would say that only those with open minds and true hearts could see the merfolk.</p>
