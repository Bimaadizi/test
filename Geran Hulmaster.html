Geran later left his position with the Red Sail Coster to study sword magic in Myth Drannor under the tutelage of the gold elf swordmaster Daried Selsherryn . However, he was banished permanently from Myth Drannor in the Year of the Purloined Statue, 1477 DR , for maiming a moon elf mage named Rhovann Disarnnyl in a duel over the affections of a moon elf maiden.</p>
<p>When Rhovann seized power in Hulburg in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Geran was exiled to Thentia with the rest of the Hulmaster clan. Geran engaged in several clandestine missions to destabilize Rhovann's rule and was captured by Rhovann while attempting to infiltrate Hulburg the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR . As retribution for his maiming by Geran, Rhovann dissolved Geran's right hand with magical acid. Geran was rescued by his friends Sarth Khul Riizar , Hamil, and Miyra , who traveled with him to the Shadowfell to destroy the magical device Rhovann used to animate his golems . Geran later slew Rhovann in a battle at Griffonwatch Keep and took Rhovann's magical silver hand to replace the hand Rhovann destroyed. With Rhovann dead and the golems disabled, the Hulmasters were able to retake control of Hulburg.</p>
