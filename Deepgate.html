<p>Deepgate was a dwarven town in the Mountains of the Alaoreum of Turmish .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Raised Banner, 227 DR , the dwarves of the Alaoreum battled a fierce red dragon known as Stormcrossing . Even though the dwarves won and King Showaxe of Ironfang claimed the red dragon's treasure hoard, the price of the victory was high. Deepgate was set ablaze by the evil wyrm. The pitch-black smoke from the fires of destruction alerted humans from the Swordslake Creek of the previously unknown dwarven habitat deep in the Mountains of the Alaoreum.</p>
