<p>Uldus Blackram was a Sharran faithful during the mid-8 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He did many things in the woods, and mostly worshipped at a local shrine by day, thanking that he was safe from the Slayer , an entity that was responsible for the disappearance of most animal life and travelers between Ripplestones and Starmantle starting from early spring of 767 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Uldus Blackram had been present for the consecration of a Sharran shrine in the woods somewhere near the Dead Place , and participated in a ritual which involved barefoot ladies dancing around the horned stone block; the memory of it made him blush. In the Year of the Awakening Wyrm, 767 DR , about two tendays into the Chaos of the Art of that year, he was called upon by the Dreadspells of Elryn to lead them into the Dead Place .</p>
<p>While leading the Sharran dreadspells to the ruins, with a noose tied to his throat, they came across Ilbryn Starym. He was struck down by one of the elf's lightning spells; Femter Deldrannus , who was holding his noose, confirmed he was indeed very dead, which tickled him as funny.</p>
