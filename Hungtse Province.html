<p>Hungtse Province was a province of Shou Lung in Kara-Tur by the 14 th century DR . Alongside Wang Kuo Province , it was the most highly populated and most thoroughly cultivated province in the empire.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Lying in the heart of the central western empire, the province was bordered in the west by Ch'ing Tung Province at the Second Emperor's Canal , in the north by Sheng Ti and Ti Erte Provinces along the Ch'ing Jung River , in the south by Wang Kuo Province and Chan Lu River , and finally in the southeast by Hai Yuan Province beyond the lower course of the Upper Hungtse River . Its eastern coastline was lapped by the Celestial Sea .</p>
<p>Surrounded by rivers, the province enjoyed lush and fertile lands. In the east, the land rose into open plains and finally rolling hills, before giving way to the Celestial Sea. To Chan Valley was large and fertile area. There were forests in the north beside the Ch'ing Jung River and in the east by the coast and the border with Hai Yuan Province. In the southeast, the lands around the junction of the Chan Lu and upper Hungtse Rivers were crisscrossed by many streams and tributaries like the Xiaoshui River; their valleys were given over to rice production. Bamboo grew along the Chan Lu River.</p>

<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>By farming silkworms , the province produced most of the silk in Shou Lung , as well as a great deal of rice and tea . The local silk industry, which was the biggest and most profitable industry in all Kara-Tur, created greater culture and trade in the province. In addition, bamboo from Hungste was supplied to Aurora's Emporium for making fowler's cages .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Early in the Ho Dynasty ( Shou Year 580 (−670 DR) to Shou Year 830 (−420 DR) ), feuding between the Ti Erte and Sheng Ti Provinces led a number of nobles to flee south. They led the settlement of Hungtse, but without their armies at their command they focused on peaceful occupations and in time faded into the agrarian communities. Following the Sharing of Meals , the Imperial Capital was even relocated from Hsi-Feng to Hai Sheng in Hungtse Province in Shou Year 631 (−619 DR) .</p>
<p>Later, during the subsequent Hai Dynasty ( Shou Year 830 (−420 DR) to Shou Year 976 (−274 DR) , ) merchants from the south imported silkworms, thus establishing the successful silk industry.</p>
<p>The Ivory Plague struck Hai Sheng in Shou Year 859 (−391 DR) . Many citizens died in the following years, with the first Emperor Chin of the Hai Dynasty and his household succumbing in the first year. Finally, in Shou Year 869 (−381 DR) , the city saw a visitation by an enormous ki-rin that saved the people from their inevitable death and ordered the surviving members of the Imperial family to leave. Afterward, the city was renamed Kirin in its honor and the Imperial Capital was relocated to Kuo Te' Lung in Wang Kuo.</p>
<p>To repel Yamun Khahan 's Grand Army of the Tuigan in the invasion of Shou Lung in the Shou Year 2609 (1359 DR) , Emperor Kai Tsao Shou Chin mustered the Army of the Northern Marches under the command of General Batu Min Ho . Hungtse was one of northern provinces that contributed soldiers to its 100,000-strong Provincial Armies.</p>
<p>In the month of Alturiak of Shou Year 2619 (1369 DR) , the Cormyrean engineer Ivar Devorast visited the Grand Canal of the Second Emperor along the border between Hungtse and Wang Kuo Province. He had been tasked by the city-state of Innarlith to construct a smaller canal to connect the Lake of Steam to the Nagaflow . Ran Ai Yu , a Shou merchant who frequented Faerûn , had brought him there aboard her ship and believed that he would learn something from it before he headed back to Innarlith. A few years later, in Alturiak of Shou Year 2624 (1374 DR) , Devorast visited Hungtse Province itself, this time with Ransar Pristoleph of Innarlith, to show him the canal when it joined the Chan Lu River.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>The Hungtse people had a reputation for being garrulous and excitable and for having hot tempers, but were seen as generally pleasant. Some families claimed an ancestor with a special connection to the ki-rin that saved Hai Sheng from the Ivory Plague and they bore an extraordinary resistance to natural diseases .</p>
<p>The province's cuisine had incredible range, thanks to the wide availability of chicken, duck , fish , shrimp , and rices . Moreover, Hungtse chefs were renowned across the land and worked in most of the best restaurants and noble houses of Shou Lung. Potstickers , a kind of tiny fried dumpling popular in Shou Lung around Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) , were created by Hungtse chefs.</p>
<p>The people spoke a provincial dialect of Kao te Shou , the official language of the empire.</p>
<h2>Locations</h2>
<p>The major city of Hungtse Province was Kirin, once the third Imperial Capital. The people there believed the city was still divinely protected by the Celestial Emperor. It was home to the White Crane Temple , home of the Order of the White Crane .</p>
<p>The province was home to countless smaller cities, towns, and villages, such as the little farming town of Linshung in the To Chan Valley.</p>
