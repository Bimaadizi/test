<p>Dela's rapier was a unique blade that once belonged to Dela Nereth , a black marker merchant and a taskmaster of the Bloodsailors gang of the Docks District of Neverwinter in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Dela's rapier posessed a +2 enchantment that made the weapon deadlier and guided the wielder's hand towards the target. Additionally, every now and then, lucky or impeccably-aimed strikes resulted in devastating damage.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dela's rapier was in the hands of Dela Nereth in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , in the months that followed the Wailing Death epidemic. She used the blade to protect herself and to skewer the enemies of the Bloodsailors – the Blackriver Bandits . She did business with the sailor- adventurer known as Eater-of-Garm during that time. Were the adventurer to oppose the Bloodsailors, Dela would lure Eater-of-Garm to her shop in the Seedy Tarven and attempt to assassinate them with her magi rapier, and subsequently be defeated. Were the adventurer to set off against the Blackriver Bandits, Dela would offer her black market goods to the adventurers to aid them in the war.</p>
