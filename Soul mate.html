<p>A soul mate was a holy sword .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Soul mates were often made of a blue steel alloy. They had plain steel pommels with ray -skin grips and short guards. There were invisible runes along their lengths, identifying their purpose. They created choruses of angelic notes and halos of light when their powers were called upon.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Though they could perform normally in anyone's hands as merely enchanted swords of superior power, when wielded by paladins they were wielded with greater deadliness. Furthermore, they enhanced their wielder's ability to turn undead and they improved their defense against magic that sought to snuff out their lives or quench their lifeforce.</p>
<p>Much like a holy avenger , it could also project a circle to unmake malevolent magic around it if wielded by a paladin.</p>
