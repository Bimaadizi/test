<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Given that their skills involved helping others, lifewardens were usually found in inhabited areas such as cities and town.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>

A green sash wrapped around their left arm, or a circlet embedded with a small green emerald in the case of high-ranking lifewardens, was their badge of office. They could only wear leather armor or padded armor and could not use shields . During combat they wielded either a staff or club .</p>
