<p>Jolora's harp was a magical harp used by the Harpers .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Jolora's harp concealed a unique power that activated only when the harpist played two clashing chords in succession, creating a discordant key-change not typical in normal music. This caused nearby magical items to temporarily lose their magical abilities. There was a chance this effect could strip magical items of their enchantments permanently. All magical items within a 50 feet (15 meters) radius, including the harp itself and any magical effects on the harpist (except for a Harper pin ) were vulnerable to this effect.</p>
