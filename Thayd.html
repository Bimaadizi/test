<p>Thayd was a wizard who led a rebellion against Mulhorand and Unther in −1087 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thayd was known as the Last Surviving Apprentice of the Imaskari. Per the memories of the Pharaoh Ratep , the wizard had learned much by studying the lore of the Imaskari , which he shared with his followers. Thayd led a rebellion against Mulhorand and Unther in −1087 DR . He briefly seized the northern provinces of both empires.</p>
<p>In −1081 DR , Thayd and his conspirators were defeated. Before his execution, he prophesied that Mulhorand and Unther would decline. He ensured that would be so by opening a portal to a savage world dominated by warmongering orcs on the same year, before his capture and execution for inciting fellow wizards to rebellion: after his death, no one in Faerun knew of the portal.</p>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>Thayd's goal was to overthrow both Mulhorand and Unther, and take their territories as part of his own Overempire to achieve limitless dominion over the Realms . In response to his rebellion, Mulhorandi arcane magic was placed under strict control by the god-kings , creating a bureaucracy of priests to keep watch over its developments, thus creating the power structures of Mulhorand that endured well into 1365 DR .</p>
<p>The orcs on the other world of his portals discovered these entryways several years later, and used them for the invasions that would later become the Orcgate Wars . Together, both events orchestrated by the archmage Thayd managed to end the Great Age of the Mulhorandi Empire.</p>
<p>The magocracy of Thay was named after Thayd, honoring him for his rebellion against Mulhorand two thousand years before and prophesizing the Empire's eventual decline.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>According to the Book of Ratep , the Pharaoh believed that Imaskari lore had corrupted Thayd as it gave him power, and that the wizard would enslave the Mulan once more if left unchecked.</p>
<p>Per some sources, he let in hordes of orcs that would fight the Empires with a curse, rather than a portal.</p>
<p>Some sources suggest that Thayd may have endured beyond his death as an undead sentience attaching itself to the living to control them, destroying his host within the space of a few weeks.</p>
