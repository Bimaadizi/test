<p>Michallon was a corrupt Netherese arcanist who served as the Chief Constable at Constabulary Branch Two in Eileanar before its destruction in 3520 NY (−339 DR) .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Michallon led the constables of the branch and liaised with Karsus and his assistants. He was aided by his equally unscrupulous Underchiefs Bengel , Ezeddeen , Hacklander , and Bias , who managed the other constables directly. Michallon used his deadly spells and contacts in the criminal world to gain a position of power that straddled law and crime, using his constabulary to quash any criminal elements that threatened his dark allies. His Underchiefs kept loyalty out of a mixture of fear and greed, and together they engendered a sense of awe and respect among the junior constables, who thought that their commanders were truly upstanding and heroic people, Michallon most of all.</p>
