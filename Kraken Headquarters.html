<p>The Kraken Headquarters was the main command post of the Kraken Society in the mid–14 th century DR , located on the isle of Trisk in the Purple Rocks in the Trackless Sea .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The gargantuan stronghold took up much of the isle of Trisk, and resembled a stone fortress with tentacle-shaped columns.</p>
<p>The front of the building itself was carved to bear the semblance of a squid that was 100 ft (30 m) tall. The eyes of the squid carving glowed with hidden light.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The inside of the castle was filled with those of the society, and margoyles , scrags , and otyughs . The scrags themselves seemed to have claimed part of the castle.</p>
<p>Well-defended forts and high parapets made up the bulk of the castle, as well as a large pier to its south.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1358 DR , the Heroes of Ascore -to-be invaded the fortress and secured a magical statuette, which was stored in a pearl chest.</p>
