<p>The Dessarin Valley , also known as the Gateway to the North by its residents, was a valley region situated between the Sword Mountains and the High Forest . It was home to a diverse range of folk, although most inhabitants were either humans or halflings . The main industry of the Dessarin Valley was agriculture, and Goldenfields played a large part in the agricultural economy of the North .</p>
<p>The Dessarin was unlike the rest of the Savage Frontier . While it was largely unsettled, comprising many scattered, remote villages and farmsteads, the valley was much safer than the surrounding area had been in years past.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The region of the Dessarin Valley was bordered on the east by the High Forest and the Forlorn Hills , and on the west by the Long Road .</p>
<h2>Geographical Features</h2>
<p>The valley was named for the great River Dessarin , that flowed from the Evermoors in the Savage Frontier , to the Sea of Swords just south of Waterdeep . It was fed by a number of tributaries, including the River Surbrin , Horn Stream , and Gaustar's Creek .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In −4420 DR , the shield dwarf kingdom of Besilmer was founded. Besilmer was a very atypical dwarf kingdom, built above ground with fields and pastures to support it. For years, Besilmer flourished but then fell under attack by giants and trolls . This led to the construction of Tyar-Besil , an underground city. Besilmer fell a century after its construction. Ruins from the kingdom still stood as late as the 15 th century DR , most notably the Stone Bridge that spanned the Dessarin River; and, although in poor condition, the ruins known as the Halls of the Hunting Axe .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Raised Sword, 893 DR , the Knights of the Silver Horn discovered the ruins of Tyar-Besil. The knights set up strongholds in the ruins but came under attack by Uruth Ukrypt . This led to Dessarin Valley being dragged into the Orcfastings War , and the First and Second Trollwars . By the Year of the Circling Vulture, 942 DR , all signs of human civilization had been wiped out.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Forbidden Tome, 949 DR , the lower area of the valley was the location of a fallen manor for the Schooled , students taught by Magister Caldauvur Maerglauthyn until his death in the same year and at the same manor.</p>
<p>Around the Year of the Wailing Winds, 1000 DR , following the expansion of Waterdeep , a few small villages started to develop. This led to the founding of Red Larch , Yartar , and Triboar .</p>
