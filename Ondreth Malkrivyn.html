<p>Ondreth Malkrivyn was a War Wizard of the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ondreth Malkrivyn was one of many War Wizards protecting the retired Vangerdahast 's sanctum near Mouth o' Gargoyles in 1373 DR . He was present during the attack by Ammaratha Cyndusk on the sanctum, and was a witness to the song dragon 's transformation into her human shape; when he saw Vangerdahast and Myrmeen Lhal carrying a floating woman away, he exclaimed something, drawing the attention of his fellow War Wizard, Telarantra . Once he explained that the woman they were carrying was actually the song dragon who attacked to kill Vangerdahast, Telarantra showed her true colors, slaying him and breaking the magic on the song dragon, to allow it to kill Vangerdahast. He was too dead to involve himself in the subsequent events.</p>
