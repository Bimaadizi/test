<p>The Land of the Snow Spirits , also called the Land of the Snow Demons , was a vast expanse of frozen tundra covering the northern edge of Kara-Tur and reaching down into the Hordelands .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Land of the Snow Spirits stretched for well over a thousand miles across the continent of Kara-Tur. It lay further north than even the Northern Wastes as it paralleled the Ulhai Shan range. It stretched from the fringes of the Eastern Sea all the way to Yal Tengri in the west. Much of the land was permafrost, while perhaps an even greater majority was composed of shifting mountainous blocks of ice.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The frozen wastes of this region were one of the most inhospitable places on Toril . It began as a land of winding rivers and bogs just north of the Ama Basin but transformed quickly into flat frozen land. The seasons changed quickly in this land, with spring being almost non-existent and summer cut short by the long winter.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the Spellplague , a group of hobgoblins that had been living in this area were enslaved by onis from the Ama Basin.</p>
