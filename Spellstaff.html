<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , a member of the Veiled Ones adventuring group, Ghleanna Stormlake , received a spellstaff from the baelnorn Miroden Silverblade . The defender of the mythal gifted the ancient weapon to the half-elven sorceress after she suffered numerous shocks and burns from the Cult of the Dragon mages. Later, the staff was instrumental in the group's battle against the leader of the cult, Kya Mordrayn . The Wearer of Purple sent a crackling lightning bolt toward Ghleanna, allowing her to absorb the spell, returning it back on Mordrayn, and badly burning her flesh. The staff was also instrumental in protecting her allies from the fiery breath of the cult's dracolich , Pelendralaar . Instead of incinerating the adventurers, Ghleanna's spellstaff absorbed the dragon's flames. Under such stress, the weapon started to smoke, and its glyphs blazed brightly.</p>
