<p>Jonstral Haerdrun was an enigmatic instrument-maker who lived within the city of Sundabar during the midâ€“14 th century DR . In addition to running his own shop, called the Lutery , Jonstal was a skilled musician in his own right, though he refused to perform for others, or teach anyone his skill.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Though he was renowned for his skill at his craft, not much was known about Jonstral among the people of Sundabar. Rumors circulated about his homeland, whether it was Neverwinter or far to the east in Rashemen .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Jonstral had a slight build, very pale white skin, and long, unruly black hair he would wear in a long pony tail.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Being a skilled carpenter and wood-worker, Jonstal would often hire some guards and embark on long forays into the forests of the North to hunt down just the right trees whose wood would be perfect for his crafted instruments. Over the course of these trips he had fought his way out of several orc ambushes.</p>
