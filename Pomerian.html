<p>Pomerian was a powerful Thayan necromancer who became a lich beholden to Grintharke , the balor ruler of Hellgate Keep , in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>As a lich Pomerian was arrogant and complacent from the power he wielded, convinced he could make no mistakes. And due to his enthrallment to Grintharke, the lich was more than willing to fight enemies to the death, as his balor master could always construct a new body for him.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>In addition to the powers granted by lichdom, Pomerian possessed a spellbook with an extensive collection of spells . These included the following:</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After an attempt to seize more power for himself nearly cost him his life, Pomerian left Thay and journeyed for some time, until finding an ally in the Cult of the Dragon . Their relationship was a means to an end, with Pomerian simply interested in gaining knowledge on prolonging his life. Once he had what he wanted, Pomerian traveled further north to the Savage Frontier , where he would come to be acquainted with Grintharke.</p>
<p>Discerning what Pomerian’s true goals were, the balor resolved to provide the necromancer the last bits of information he was missing to undergo lichdom. Pomerian set about preparing a hidden for his lichdom ritual, thinking he was being furtive, but in reality his movements were being monitored by Grintharke’s spies. On the day of the ritual, when the last of Pomerian’s life force was seeping into his phylactery , Grintharke jumped in and soul the vessel, teleporting it away to a hiding place he had specially prepared and whose location he had magically obfuscated. Grintharke then returned to the cave and explained to Pomerian that he was to be in his service, until such a day came when the balor felt like giving the phylactery back.</p>
<p>Around the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Pomerian led the forces of Hellgate Keep through the Underdark and back out to the surface in a surprise attack on the town of Llorkh . They were comprised of a horde of various orc tribes, a quarter of which were worg cavalry, 18 ogres from the Greypeak Mountains , 13 hill giants likewise from the Greypeaks, and 19 elite drow troops from Menzoberranzan . Using the Pipes of Doom , a powerful magical item that Grintharke's former master had created, he was able to route Llorkh's forces before they had a chance to repulse the invasion.</p>
<p>The Hellgate army then set their sights on the town of Loudwater , though its ruler Nanathlor Greysword was preparing for their attack, as he had been forewarned of it by a half-orc spy by the name of Barnabas . However, their duplicity did not go unnoticed - Pomerian had discovered the half-orc was a double agent well before they made their ascent on Llorkh. Rather than eliminating him right away, Pomerian decided to keep Barnabas around and fed with nominal intel, reasoning that the spy could be exploited to create diversions.</p>
<p>When the Battle of Loudwater commenced, Pomerian darkened the fair skies by summoning thick, foreboding clouds with the Pipes of Doom' control weather power. He then used spell scrolls to cast mass invisibility on his drow forces, enabling them to attempt a stealth attack on the enemy command post. Finally, the lich took to the center of the horde, flanked by ogres, and proceeded to play the Pipes of Doom to induce a steady retreat from the forces amassed at Loudwater.</p>
<p>Which side was victorious in this battle was ultimately uncertain, though the odds were firmly stacked against the forces of Loudwater and they were said to have suffered staggering losses. With a draw in the conflict, the Hellgate army set up camp for the night near the South Wood , working to construct huge rafts with which to cross the otherwise impassable River Shining .</p>
<p>Shortly after the night's evenfeast, while Pomerian plotted away the next day's strategy within his command tent , a group of korreds snuck into camp and stole the Pipes of Doom . Once Pomerian realized they were missing, he sent a force of elite individuals out into the woods to recover the stolen Pipes and kill the thieving korreds. Lead by the fire giant Slag , they included the drow Lilliana , George the gorgon , and roguish twin princes Dammek and Dammon . The spy Barnabas took this opportunity to slink off to the opposing camp and tell Nanathlor of what had transpired. This gave the forces of Loudwater new found hope, for if they could retrieve the Pipes of Doom before the Hellgate army and destroy them, Loudwater would have a chance at routing the invaders. And so a group of renowned adventurers set forth on this quest.</p>
<p>When Barnabas returned to the Hellgate camp, he was swiftly detained and subjected to an ESP spell. Through this they probed his mind for what had just went down back at Nanathalor's camp. Seeing no further use for the spy, Pomerian killed Barnabas and then left to join his units in the recovery of the Pipes of Doom .</p>
<p>When he caught up to the group Pomerian informed them of how their situation had altered. Slag then carried him the rest of the way to their destination. Sources differ on which group arrived first to the circular clearing of the korreds, where they were using the pipes as part of their ceremonies of dancing, but all agree on the tactics employed by the Hellgate party.</p>
<p>Pomerian covered himself in dust of disappearance , then cast upon himself fly , as well as levitation as a back-up precaution. He then enlarged his body, guarded it with protection from good , and enhanced his senses with ESP and detect invisibility . Lastly, Pomerian hasted his party and backed up their assault by summoning forth six hobgoblins and six shadows .</p>
<p>The chieftain of the korreds was particularly singled out by the lich, who conjured an air elemental to attack him. When the adventurers intervened and had it destroyed, Pomerian resorted to casting true seeing and spectral hand , then through that spectral hand attacked the most powerful of the adventurers with the spells burning hands and vampiric touch . And if this battle dragged on for long enough, Pomerian was prepared to unleash his most powerful spells with reckless abandon, no longer caring if harm befell his allies in the process.</p>
<p>As the town of Loudwater did not fall to the forces of Grintharke in 1358 DR, the adventurers presumably won out against Pomerian and his lackeys.</p>
