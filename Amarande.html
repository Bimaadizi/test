<h2>Relationships</h2>

<p>Both Amarande and Seniyad were two of the region's three archdruids, but were polar opposites in their goals and the means by which they sought to achieve them. Amarande thought Seniyad and his followers to be foolish pacifists who were too naive to truly serve nature.</p>
