<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Assassin's headwrap dramatically increased the wearer's ability to stealth and avoid detection. Additionally, its magic concealed the wearer after a successful killing strike.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Assassin's headwrap , originally part of a set of light armor , was commissioned by an unnamed Merchant Prince of Amn for his daughter, who sought to become an infamous assassin after dreaming about it. Unbeknownst to her father, the daughter began training to become an assassin with her father's less-than-savory contacts in Amn's criminal underbelly. Despite the daughter's fears, her Merchant Prince father, did not disavow her upon finding out. Instead, he commissioned the creation of assassin's headwrap and the rest of the stealth-enhancing magic armor for her.</p>
<p>Sometime later, by the late 15 th century DR, assassin's headwrap was damaged and ripped apart. It could have been repaired by a master smith form Luskan , using a scarf and cloth of a hood, found in the Underdark in the Savage Frontier .</p>
