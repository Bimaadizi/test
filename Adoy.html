<p>Adoy was a wild mage hermit who lived in the Cloud Peak mountains during the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He saw wild magic as an expression of chaos and believed it could not truly be controlled by its practitioners.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Adoy was in the possession of a unique belt that protected him from accidentally transforming himself into a form he didn't so wish.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He chose to live far removed from settlements and civilization, so as to not draw unwanted attention from the Order of the Eight Staves . He had a peculiar fondness for eating tree bark and raw snails .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>While living in the mountains, Adoy was acquainted with Magreb and Rilsa , two ranger who lived in a nearby cabin.</p>
<p>He acted as a mentor of sorts to the young wild mage Neera . He fulfilled this role both during their brief meeting in the Cloud Peaks, and the time following his death.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Adoy inadvertently attracted a tribe of goblins to his hideout while making a pot of porridge. These goblins became convinced he was the goblinoid deity of cooperation Bargrivyek , and began to worship him as such. A hobgoblin by the name of Rogdok took advantage of this situation by capturing Adoy, gaining power over the goblins and becoming their king.</p>
<p>Later that year Adoy was rescued from imprisonment by Neera, who hoped to gain further understanding over her powers. Unfortunately her intervention attracted the attention of the Red Wizard Ekandor , who had been tracking her movements. After dealing with Ekandor, Adoy bid farewell to Neera and disappeared in a flash of magic.</p>
<p>The Order of the Eight Staves eventually caught up with Adoy, experimented upon him, and eventually tortured him to death. His consciousness became trapped in the Fugue Plane , though it maintained communication with Neera by some manner of telepathy. Neera traveled to a portal in the ruins of Kanaglym called the Fountain of Nepenthe , to free Adoy's spirit. While he was eternally bound to the Fugue Plane, he did manage to offer Neera one final piece of advice: to remain vigilant and watch out for others like her.</p>
