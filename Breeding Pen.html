<p>The Breeding Pen was a festhall located in the southwestern Ring Caverns of Oryndoll . This was a place where mind flayers went to breed their prize thralls .</p>
<p>Other illithid would often watch the thralls breed and actively read the thrall's minds during the act. The purpose was to feel what they normally could not, since they were sexless.</p>
