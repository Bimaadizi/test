<p>The Talanthil Dynasty was the second dynasty to assume power in the nation of Raumathar , reigning from -605 DR to -150 DR . With the sudden deaths of the last remnants of the Nhalass Dynasty killed by demons from Narfell , Raumathar was left without a clear leading family. However, the Talanthil's rose to power during this time with the overwhelming support of the public.</p>
