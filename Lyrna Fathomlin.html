<p>Lyrna was a member of House Fathomlin of Myth Akherynnar in Miyeritar when the Dark Disaster ravaged her homeland, turning it into the desolate High Moor circa −10,500 DR . After the failure of the Myriad Ritual to halt the Killing Storms, and the subsequent destruction of the city of Faer'tel'miir , she and a procession of other dark elven high mages departed Myth Akherynnar on a suicide mission to drive the Killing Storms into Aryvandaar , the land of the conquerors who had conjured the storms in the first place. They departed on a three-day journey to the Tosofome Caldera to enact their ritual.</p>
<p>Somehow, Lyrna became separated from her group, and found herself 90 miles (140 kilometers) off course in the ruins of Faer'tel'miir. There, she encountered a sharn, and was subsumed by a sharn symbiote to be assimilated as a new sharn.</p>
