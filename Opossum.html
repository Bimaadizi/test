<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the ancient Netherese enclave of Eileanar , magically altered opossums known as sniffers acted as the noses of spider golems .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Opossums were arboreal creatures. They hunted poisonous snakes .</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Opossums could be found in Cormanthor , Thar , the Tannath Gap , Semberholme , and the Mere of Dead Men . Intelligent opossums capable of speech were found on the Steaming Isles , where they acted as chamberlains and household servants to the animal pashas . Due to the influence of Citadel Umbra , opossums of the Winterglen operated as spies for Unseelie creatures in the forest.</p>

<p>Some were known to act as servants of the deity Thoth .</p>
<h3>Subspecies</h3>
<p>The copper opossum was a native to Cormyr , living on its hills. Its diet mainly consisted of weeds and sprouts. The shy creature rolled itself into a ball at the least provocation; if attacked past that point, it could lash with the venomous spikes just above its feet.</p>
<p>Though some long-lived locals related it causing paralysis, the poison was known to actually induce an effect all but indistinguishable from temporal stasis , except that neutralize poison could break it as well. A competent metalworker could also extract up to five pounds of metal from the pelt of a copper opossum, which incidentally, contained actual copper .</p>
<p>Giant opossums were known to live west of Urmlaspyr , where the largest game reserve for the species in Toril was.</p>
