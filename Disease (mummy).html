<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hamezaar , the vampire ruler of the Boneyard , once worked to recruit Death, Disease, and Destruction to his undead armies, but they declined for lack of interest.</p>
<p>Circa 1372 DR , the trio were searching for an annihilator , intending to capture and control it with the aid of Destruction's charm monster eye-ray power. After they had an annihilator, Destruction wanted to hunt down and slay the outcast beholder Tobulux for being an abomination, as well as his illithid companion Ralayn who would oppose them.</p>
