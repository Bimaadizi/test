<p>Temple Hill was the westernmost of the four hills in Chult atop which Port Nyanzaru was built. It was located on the northern side of the Merchants' Ward .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The top of Temple Hill was dominated by the Temple of Savras , which was also the hill's namesake. The hill was quite steep, and the upper area was completely walled-off from the lower ground, making it generally an exclusive area for the city's wealthy. Accordingly, a handful of villas were located there. A wide stone bridge atop arched columns connected the top of Temple Hill to the top of neighboring Throne Hill to the south, while a second bridge extended to a rocky outcropping in the Bay of Chult atop which was located the Temple of Sune . The city's Temple of Gond sat at the eastern base of the hill near the Royal Docks .</p>
