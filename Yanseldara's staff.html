<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The long oak staff had three finger-like extensions that held a large topaz spirit gem , that contained within it the spirit of Hethcypressarvil , the black dragon that was slain by the Lady Lord.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Through its spirit gem , the staff was able to facilitate communication between mortals of the Prime Material plane and undead spirits .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR , Hethcypressarvil stole Yanseldara's staff and somehow placed within its gem her own mortal soul. While her spirit was trapped in the gem alongside that of his own, the dragon sought to permanently unite them by utilizing a permanent love potion and a ritual conducted by the Shou spellcaster Lady Feng .</p>
<p>The novice Harper Ruha embarked on a mission to recover the staff from Ginger Palace near Elversult, unaware it was actually hidden away within the dragon's swampy lair .</p>
<p>A short time later, Lady Feng's son Prince Kao Chou Tang embarked on a military mission to save his mother from Hethcypressarvil's swamp. While his soldiers were all slain, Tang fled the destruction and sneaked his way into the dragon's lair. Together they recovered the staff and destroyed its spirit gem , freeing the soul of Yanseldara, and stripping the dracolich of its undead immortality.</p>
<p>After Yanseldara recovered from her affliction and was reunited with her staff, she was gifted a large ruby by the Shou royal family, to take the place of the shattered topaz pommel.</p>
