<p>Delvers were a species of subterranean aberrations .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These creatures had huge teardrop-shaped bodies with rock-like skin, that was always covered in a mucus-like slime that it secreted. Almost the entire underside of their body consisted of their mouth. They had only two flipper-like appendages at the front of their body, with ended in blunt claws.</p>
<p>On average a delver grew to be 15 feet (4.6 meters) in length and 10 feet (3 meters) wide, weighing on average 6,000 pounds (2,700 kilograms).</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Delvers had a shy demeanor and were largely peaceful creatures, though there were cases of rogue murderous specimens.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>These creatures could see in areas of total darkness and sense vibrations in the earth . The slime that secreted from their skin was highly corrosive. This made it easier for them to burrow through solid stone, their mere touch being acidic , and they impervious to harm from acids. They could also temporarily alter their slime to soften stone instead of dissolving it, allowing them to manipulate it in a way similar to the spell stone shape . A large quantity of water (at least 1 quart (0.95 liters)) or a weak acid, such as vinegar , could wash off their slime.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Delvers fought by means of their huge blunt claws and corrosive slime. They preferred to fight from the safety of their tunnels, using them to protect their flank. If they anticipated a conflict a delver sometimes honeycombed their area with tunnels, leaving most of them closed with layers of stone that were 1​ to ​2 inches (0.025​ to ​0.051 meters) thick. Once the threat came near they would then dissolve their way through this thin stone cover to get the drop on them.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>These creatures typically left in their wake usable tunnels that were roughly 10 feet (3 meters) in diameter.</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Delvers were a lithovorous species, subsisting upon primarily rock that they dissolved with their slime and then shoved under their bodies. They were even willing to eat some creatures of elemental earth , such as earth elementals and xorn .</p>
<p>Much like how humans liked to add spices to their food, delvers enjoyed various non-metallic minerals as seasoning. Metals on the other hand acted as an intoxicant to them, which they could become addicted to.</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>Delvers typically spoke both Terran and Undercommon .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Some adventurers were known to secure assistance or information from delvers in return for delicious minerals, usually in the form of gemstones and some coins .</p>
<p>Delvers that became addicted to metals were known to menace both miners and anyone they came across that carried metal equipment.</p>
