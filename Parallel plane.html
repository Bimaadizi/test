<p>Parallel planes were planes of existence which existed in parallel with the Prime Material Plane . They were defined by a shared geography, bestiary, and were more easily reached than other planes by inhabitants of the Prime. The parallel planes were created in the days of creation when the Primordials , mighty beings on par with the gods , split the Prime into three parts, finding some parts "too bright" or "too dark."</p>
<p>The two parallel planes created were the Plane of Shadow and the Feywild , although the Plane of Shadow later transformed into the Shadowfell .</p>
