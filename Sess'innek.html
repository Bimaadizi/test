<p>Sess'innek was a tanar'ri demon lord worshiped by the lizardfolk as a deity of civilization and dominion. His symbol was a green, clawed, reptilian hand.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sess'innek took the form of a six-armed lizard king with vestigial greenish-brown wings. Each of his six hands wielded a longsword of potent magical power.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Sess'innek kept himself apart from other demon lords , sealing his layer from all intruders. The lizardfolk deity Semuanya counted him an enemy.</p>
<h2>Realm</h2>
<p>Sess'innek dwelt on the seventh layer of the Abyss , known as Kearackinin , or the Phantom Plane . Furthermore, Sess'innek had sealed and "locked" the layer so it could not be accessed without his express permission. It was said that Sess'innek was tired of the Blood War , and went into his self-imposed exile, in order to have nothing to do with the politics of the Abyss.</p>
<p>The Phantom Plane was only discovered when the wizard Mordenkainen managed to temporarily break the seals.</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Sess'innek was revered by both khaasta and the half-demonic lizard kings, and thus by extension their tribes. Such tribes generally had only a single lizard king ruler and those who failed to prove worthy of ruling were killed and sacrificed to Sess'innek. The exceptions were those that elected to become shamans instead of leaders although most were too prideful to take such a route. In addition, some tanar'ri priests were known to pledge themselves to his service.</p>
<h3>Clergy</h3>
<p>Sess'innek had few shamans, with the vast majority of them being lizard kings, the descendants of lizardfolk and demons loyal to Sess'innek. Sess'innek required his shamans to be aggressive in spreading his faith, and to slay clerics of Semuanya on sight. Lizardfolk druids were also occasionally incorporated into the hierarchy of Sess'innek.</p>
<h2>Holy Days & Rituals</h2>
<p>Sess'innek demanded regular sacrifices in his name and little else. The khaasta sacrificed approximately one in ten prisoners to their demonic patron. Twice a week, lizard kings gathered late at night to tear the hearts from sentient beings and devour them amid prayers to Sess'innek.</p>
<p>A weapon of the deity from Sess'innek produced a +1 corrosive longsword .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Demogorgon freed his creations, the khaasta, that race of planar lizardkin began to gather under Sess'innek's banner.</p>
<p>In order to aid the khaasta in their war against the sarrukh , Sess'innek sent demons to rally lizardfolk tribes to his banner. The lizard kings were the half-demonic descendants of those demons.</p>
