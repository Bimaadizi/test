<p>Obiron Matrell II and his twin sister Quindy Matrell were the youngest members of the noble merchant House Matrell as of 1373 DR . Young Obiron's namesake was Obiron Matrell I , the founder of the family.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>As a kid, Obiron was a wild child who once terrified the entire household by yelling and charging across the gardens of the Matrell estate waving around a loaded crossbow . Both twins were affectionate with their family and especially showed love for young Emriana.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Obiron and his sister were born on Ches 4 of the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR to father Evester Matrell , who was business savvy heir to the family's trade, and to mother Marga Talricci of House Talricci . Young Quindy showed interest in all things traditionally feminine, very much like her mother, while Obiron Matrell II was more akin to his father.</p>
<p>On Tarsakh 13 of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , both twins were present at Emriana Matrell's grand sixteenth birthday celebration, a big occasion for the nobility of Arrabar . During the celebration, they witnessed an assassination attempt on the family's elderly yet willful matriarch Hetta Matrell . The assassination attempt was later revealed to have been orchestrated by a sneak coin cabal that included the twins' own father, Evester Matrell.</p>
<p>Later the same year, the twins were kidnapped by the surviving member of the same cabal – Grozier Talricci . Marga Talricci, the twins' mother, was ensorcelled to remain silent but managed to write down the culprit's name on a piece of paper. Quindy and Obiron were rescued by Emriana and her mercenary aunt Xaphira Matrell .</p>
