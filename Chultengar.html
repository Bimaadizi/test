<p>The Chultengar referred to a branch of the main jungle of Chult that encroached on Thindol and Samarach .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Chultengar lay between the Luo Peaks in the north and the Sanrach Mountains to the south. The rain forest swept east to the doorstep of Narubel .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Tribes of pterafolk , each ruled by a single spirit naga , were the dominant lifeform within the Chultengar. Other species present included wild dwarves , wyverns , and batiri .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The spirit nagas met with three ha-nagas on a yearly basis somewhere within the dense Chultengar. They called themselves the Conclave of Spirits . Bands of yuan-ti allies of House Sauringar from Narubel carried tribute to the spirit nagas as payment for services they provided in the past in helping the Sauringar wrest control of Narubel from humans .</p>
