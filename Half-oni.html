<p>Half-oni were the offspring of an oni and another humanoid creature.</p>
<p>Male oni were known to sometimes take human females as brides.</p>
<p>When ogres and oni magi bred, the resulting half-oni eventually developed into a new race of ogrima .</p>
<p>Half-oni could also be produced through magical means, as occurred in the town of Kudoku , when the wu jen geisha Namiko Li began using dark rituals to transform herself and her servants into oni.</p>
