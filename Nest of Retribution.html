<p>The Nest of Retribution was a group of aarakocra from the Star Mounts who had survived the destruction of their colony by the green dragon Elaacrimalicros .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Nest of Retribution was made up of ten members who were clerics , druids , and wizards that all had ties to the Elemental Plane of Air .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The members of this organization dedicated their lives to reclaiming their home in the Star Mounts and exacting revenge upon Elaacrimalicros for the destruction of their colony. They were prepared to accomplish this goal by any means necessary, up to sacrificing their own lives. Over time they would summon elementals from the Plane of Air and either perform services or retrieved items for them in return for a pledge that it would one day aid them in their battle against Elaacrimalicros.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>This group operated out of an aerie in the Lost Peaks . As they were frequently out on missions it was rare to see more than three members present at their aerie. At most, one could typically be found within their aerie.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The members of this organization created a portal that hung roughly 0.25 miles (400 meters) away from the eastern edge of the Lost Peaks. To maximize its secrecy the portal no visible signs of its location or boundaries, leaving the aarakocra to memorize how to orient themselves to find it. Opening the portal requires speaking the phrase, "swift passage," in Auran .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The aerie of this organization was guarded by a variety of air elementals , air mephits , and arrowhawks . An air genasi , known as Shyven Arvagress , served as the captain of this elemental guard and unlike the others was paid for their services by the aarakocra.</p>
