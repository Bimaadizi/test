<h2>History</h2>
<p>Conbert always dreamed of becoming a performer but in order to earn a living he joined the Red Plumes.</p>
<p>Circa 1486 DR , Conbert was fascinated by Felratha 's new performers (secretly an adventuring party in disguise). Conbert showed great interest in Felratha's minstrel profession, wanting to know everything about it. When he spoke to her it was very rapid, his voice growing high pitched in his excitement. Conbert had grown tired of the mercenary life and wanted to desert the Red Plumes if ever the right occasion arose.</p>
