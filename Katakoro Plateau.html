<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Ancient History</h3>
<p>By −6422 DR , the Katakoro Plateau stood at the eastern border of the Imaskar Empire . During the Middle Kingdoms period ( −6422 DR to −4370 DR ), Katakoro had become a province of the eastern Upper Kingdom of the empire, home to the cities of Ormui , Hoazyu , and Auyzolu .</p>
<p>The Imaskar Empire fell in −2488 DR , but the eastern provinces of Katakoro and Khati emerged relatively unscathed. Thus, in −2487 DR , Kujawa claimed power in Khati and declared himself Emperor, founding a new realm, Anok-Imaskar , covering Katakoro. His empire would collapse with his death in −1943 DR , leaving Katakoro's fate unrecorded. [ speculation ]</p>
<h3>Modern History</h3>
<p>In 1360 DR , Raja Ambuchar Devayam of Solon led his undead armies in a conquest of Ra-Khati and a number of settlements on the Katakoro Plateau.</p>
