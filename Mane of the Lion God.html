<p>Manes of the Lion-God were worn with great pride by the druids of Nobanion who warred against lycanthrope servants of Malar , Nobanion's enemy. These clocks served as reminders that there was order even in nature. As of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Nobanionite religion started spreading outside the Gulthmere Forest, along with the church, Manes of the Lion-God started appearing in regions other than the Vilhon Reach . One such cloak was being sold by a druid merchant who did business on the Market Triangle in Westgate.</p>
