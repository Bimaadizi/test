<p>Whelanxdryn's of Elturel was a large and wide-reaching scabbard -making business in Elturel during the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Whelanxdryn's produced leather scabbards for export across much of Faer√ªn . It had its own tannery for preparing the hides it used, and a metalworking workshop that produced the various small metal fittings that reinforced and strengthened the scabbards. The business used an ever-changing supply of cheap metal and hides from passing traders, rather than a permanent supplier. It was linked by a merchants' map to the Arthane Armory in Waterdeep , which bought the scabbards for newly made longswords and other weapons.</p>
