<p>The voulge was a popular polearm variation on the axe and cleaver , variously classified within either the poleaxe family of weapons or the family of polearms that were derived from agricultural tools.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Voulges consisted of a long, stout shaft, measuring 7​ to ​8 feet (2.1​ to ​2.4 meters) in length, mounted at the end with a large heavy cleaving blade. Sometimes the top front or back edge of this blade was ground down, giving it a narrowed spiked tip and a hook-shaped fluke at its rear.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>The cleaving head of a voulge was used for the purpose of cleaving through armor, aided by the leverage which their poles gave. Those that featured a spiked tip or fluke at their end were better suited for keeping enemies at a distance. And the spiked tip of a voulge was also used for piercing through armor. They required two hands to wield.</p>
<p>They were relatively easy to craft and simple to learn how to wield, But they were one of the slowest varieties of polearms.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The design of the voulge was originally derived from peasants fastening meat cleavers to the end of staves to form makeshift polearms.</p>
