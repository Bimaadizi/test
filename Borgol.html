<h2>Personality</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the late 1470s DR, Borgol was made to serve the le Shay Prince Araithe and his drow troops as part of a concession relating to the Pact of Eschatos , negotiated by the le Shay and the fomorians after Araithe captured a fomorian princess, Marabaldia . Araithe planned to eliminate Marabaldia without risking himself or his drow by compelling the princess's friend, Suka , to kill her, thus inciting Borgol to kill Suka. This plan failed, and Borgol fought alongside Marabaldia and Suka to escape. Borgol would ultimately lose his life in the ruins of Caer Corwell when he used his body to block drow arrows intended for Marabaldia.</p>
