<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1219 DR, Lord Geldirth attempted to increase the family earnings by branching out into direct trading, over and above their existing caravan mastering business. His idea was to build a secret underground facility where goods could be shipped via portals quickly and without the burdens of shipping over land. To this end, he bought slaves in Skullport and brought them up through the city sewers to construct a complex of rooms beneath the family villa and an adjacent warehouse in the North Ward . When the job was done, the slaves were resold and those that could not be resold were put to death.</p>
<p>For decades, goods came into the warehouse and then went down to a portal in the secret chambers. After passing through a few intermediate portals , the goods emerged on the southern slopes of the Dark Hills not far from the Delimbiyr Route and Secomber . The illicit trade greatly increased the Gost family's fortunes, but the portal route was difficult to keep secure, which cut into profits. Lord Geldirth either died or handed the title and the family businesses over to his heir, Harthar, by the Year of Many Monsters, 1233 DR .</p>
