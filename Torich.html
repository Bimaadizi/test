<p>Torich was a city of modest size in the Sanrach Mountains of Samarach , the Hidden Kingdom.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Torich was located in Samarach's northeastern corner, in the foothills of the Sanrach Mountains.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Torich's close vicinity to salt deposits ensured its wealth and growth. The city's salt mines produced salt of the highest quality.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Torich's salt mine was attacked by a tribe of firenewts who came from deeper levels. The creatures dragged workers underground and claimed the excavation as the surviving miners fled. Torich's militia was informed of the attack but failed to act in a timely manner. Essien , one of the mine's foremen, was desperate for help against the fiery monsters. Some said that a group of adventurers who worked with merchant Sa'Sani of Samargol volunteered to help with the situation and eradicate the infestation.</p>
