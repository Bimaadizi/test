<p>The collection known as Soargar's Legacy was a selection of relics of Old Impiltur , including the Crown of Narfell and a hundred or so magical swords . Before the kingdom's fall, these wondrous items were safeguarded by the Mage Royal , Soargar , in hope that they would be used to once again unite the realm.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Spouting Fish, 922 DR , a disease known as the Tortoiscab Plague was inflicted upon the royal family of Impiltur, and within two years the only survivor was Princess Aliia . The young heiress to the kingdom had been betrothed to, and since sailed off to marry, Prince Rhiigard Obarskyr of Cormyr . However, she perished as well in the Year of the Fearless Peasant, 926 DR , when her ship, Nadyra's Glory , was sunk by the succubus Soneillon , the same fiend responsible for her family's untimely deaths.</p>
<p>As the court of Old Impiltur devolved into throngs of feuding nobles and families vying for power, Soargar raided the royal treasury and made safe the kingdom's most treasured material possessions. Soargar kept these relics hidden and safe until a time when he saw best to reveal their whereabouts.</p>
<p>This time came over a century later, in the Year of the Dawndance, 1095 DR , after War Captain Imphras Heltharn united the city-states of Lyrabar , Hlammach , Dilpur , and Sarshel , along with their elven and dwarven neighbors, and led them in a campaign to defeat a massive horde of hobgoblins from the Earthfast Mountains . Aiding this alliance were Soargar, the sorceress Sambrall , and a visiting mage from Baldur's Gate by the name of Velgarbrin . A decisive battle in the conflict took place on the shore of the Bluefang Water , which saw Imphras, Soargar, and their allies victorious, though at a cost. The old wizard took a mortal wound and, in his last breaths, urged the War Captain to seek out his tower in Lyrabar and claim the regalia of Old Impiltur; this included the Crown of Narfell, the symbol of royal Impilturan rule, and over 100 swords of legend that had been borne in service to the throne.</p>
