<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point before 1369 DR , while exploring the ruins of Myth Drannor , Jelde Asturien found his way into the ancient tomb under the mansion of House Ammath in the Glim-Gardens district and created a vault in one of its secret rooms. In 1369 DR, the vault still contained Jelde's blade of destruction and a set of arcane mail , with a message written by him that offered these enchanted items as aid to future explorers as their original owners no longer needed them. However, a dark naga nested in the adjacent room to the hidden vault making it dangerous to access.</p>
