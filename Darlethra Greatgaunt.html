<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the aftermath of the Council of the Dragon of late Mirtul in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Lady Darlethra Greatgaunt was abed from a failed poisoning by an unknown party; her guest Mirt , in turn, was impersonating Rhauligus Helderstone . The Marchioness Immerdusk and Harper Storm Silverhand was herself impersonating Lady Greatgaunt while she slept, and during this impersonation, she was accompanied in extended walks through the streets of Suzail by the fugitive mage Elminster Aumar , who impersonated instead the War Wizard Reldyk Applecrown .</p>
<p>She was later carried out from her with no mess or noise, by someone whom Storm Silverhand was certain to be a noble's agent acting in revenge against an enemy of Rauligus Helderstone, as Mirt had already come across one enemy of Rauligus before and gotten into deep trouble. The same person slew Lady Greatgaunt's cook, leaving only her head for them to find.</p>
