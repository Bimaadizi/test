<p>Point Iron was a small yet profitable iron mine located along the coast of the southern Moonsea , north-east of Mulmaster . It was worked by dwarves until around the 1260s DR , but by 1367 DR it had fallen under duergar control. Rumors persisted of a gold vein in the mine, but it was never found.</p>
