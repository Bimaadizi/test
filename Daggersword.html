<p>A daggersword was an enchanted longsword that could come apart into both a dagger and a shortsword .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The wielder of a daggersword could quickly shift its form back-and-forth between the single long blade and the dual shorter blades, choosing the configuration that most suited their needs in combat.</p>
<p>While in its longsword form, the long blade could be launched off the hilt with enough force to impale a target from 30 feet (9.1 meters) away, and potentially knock them over. This left the wielder holding only the dagger portion, however the full blade would soon magically return and reattach to the daggersword .</p>
