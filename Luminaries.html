<p>The Luminaries were a sect of warlocks who drew their power from the primordial known as Telos , and who served functions similar to those of priests in Vaasa during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Luminaries were recruited from among the nishaadhri , the spellcasters bound in service to the Warlock Knights of Vaasa. Only nishaadhri who had attained high status were extended an invitation to join this elite group. The Luminaries themselves were independent of the Warlock Knights, although both organizations served the Voice of Telos .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Telos worship was the de facto state religion in Vaasa under the Warlock Knights, and because Luminaries were the rough equivalent of Telos's priests, they were the most fanatical of the primordial's warlocks and worshipers. However, they were also party to the Knights' parasitic relationship with Telos even as their leader advocated for honoring the sleeping primordial's will.</p>
<p>The primary duty of the Luminaries was to preside over the temples and shrines dedicated to Telos, such as at the Citadel of the Iron Sky in Telos City . They also served as advisors to the Warlock Knights and would sometimes fight alongside them in battle.</p>
<p>The Luminaries were charged with reinforcing the Warlock Knights' armies by creating crazed constructs—known as shardsouls —by fusing pieces of Telos's soul into bodies made of ironfell mined from his body.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Luminaries favored ironfell morningstars in combat and wore ironfell rings . They dressed in gray robes with veils.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Luminaries were founded by the Voice of Telos sometime after Telos fell to Toril during the events of the Spellplague .</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, some of these priests were secretly worshipers of Bane , calling their loyalty to Vaasa into question.</p>
<p>When Castle Perilous mysteriously rejuvenated in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , a Luminary led the investigation into what had happened.</p>
