<p>Darathra Shendrel was a human knight and the Lord Protector of Triboar in the Dessarin Valley , as well as a former adventurer and a member of the Harpers , in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Darathra hailed from Waterdeep . She became an adventurer and a Harper agent .</p>
<p>She was later elected by people of Triboar to serve as the Lord Protector, and retired from adventuring.</p>
<p>Some time after 1485 DR , the fire giants Ildmane and Okssort launched a surprise assault on Triboar at highsun with a force of orogs , magmins , and axe beak â€“mounted orcs in an effort to retrieve a piece of the Vonindod , which they'd found buried beneath the caravan campgrounds . First, they had orcs attack ranches in the southeast as a distraction, so Darathra sent the Twelve away to investigate. Then the fire giants hurled boulders that damaged and destroyed carts and businesses, while their magmins set fire to buildings, and the orcs and orogs battled town defenders, causing most people to flee or hide. It was left up to Darathra, heroic townsfolk, and a band of adventurers to defend Triboar. In the aftermath, Darathra gave the adventurers a badge bearing the Triboar insignia and dispatched them to Dral Thelev in Everlund , who would teleport them to Moongleam Tower so they report to the Harpers on the fire giant incursion into the Dessarin Valley.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As Lord Protector, Darathra created and adjudicated local laws, which were known as the Lord's Decree. Her duty was to resolve disputes and maintain peace. She also commanded the Twelve , a mounted patrol of the Triboar militia, to enforce her laws and defend the town. She'd sworn an oath to protect the town and took it quite seriously. However, Harbin Wester , town master of Phandalin , tried to have delivered to her a letter of complaint about her supposedly allowing orcs to infest the hills near his town and for not properly patrolling the road linking their communities.</p>
<p>As a Harper, she was the main point of contact for fellow Harpers seeking refuge at the Home of the Boars , a lodge on the edge of town. Her Harper connections were not public knowledge, but nor would they surprise anyone. She herself had little contact with the larger organization, but was friends with Krowen Valharrow . Endrith Vallivoe , a Harper sympathizer in Red Larch , would send Harper adventurers or allies her way to aid her in times of trouble.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was good-natured and had a reputation for fairness and sensible governance. Darathra believed that good people must be allowed to prosper free from tyranny and she was willing to give her life for the people of Triboar. She was resolute and never backed down, and pushed back when pressured. She was courageous in battle.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>She was also a good winemaker, being known for the fine wines she produced.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>She fought with greatsword and heavy crossbow and wore a breastplate . She rode an unarmored warhorse named Buster.</p>
