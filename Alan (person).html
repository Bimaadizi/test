<p>Alan was one of the inhabitants of Daggerford who died and was buried long before 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Presumably Alan's last adventure was the cause of his death. He was buried in the Daggerford Graveyard just a couple of hours outside of the city walls, in the Eastern Farmlands . His grave was topped with a monument of a bigger size than the most in the south-eastern corner of the gated land a stone's throw away from a stream that eventually joined Delimbiyr River . By 1372 DR, Alan's grave marker was still in good condition with the engravings clearly readable.</p>
