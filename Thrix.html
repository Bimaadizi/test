<p>Thrix the Profane was a cornugon that served under Belhifet in Avernus for at least a century's time.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>While he obeyed Belhifet to the letter, Thrix was insightful enough to see when his master's time was at an end. He was also opportunistic enough to aid anyone that appeared to be a threat to Belhifet's reign.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The devil had grown somewhat weary of his master Belhifet, particularly after his failed attempt to conquer Easthaven and the other Ten Towns using the Crenshinibon .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thrix served Belhifet from his escape onto Toril in the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR to well into the 14 th century DR .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , he encountered the Hero of Baldur's Gate after the imp masquerading as Hephernaan opened the portal beneath Dragonspear Castle . He proposed a wager to the Bhaalspawn : if the hero could answer a unique riddle, he would grant them a powerful magical item and passage into the Basalt Tower , if they couldn't, Thrix would claim their soul or that of one of their companions.</p>
