<p>Diderius was a powerful wizard that discovered an ancient and powerful divination pool.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>While the exact specifications are unknown, Diderius held some connection to the empire of ancient Netheril and possibly the survivor-state of Anauria . This as evidenced by the artistic works within his tomb , and the historical origins of one of his most treasured possessions.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Diderius held a great passion for divination and it was use of that magic that led to the pool that further enhanced his powers.</p>
<p>He was not overly greedy and offered his services to the townsfolk that lived near his mansion for meager compensation.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>During his life, Diderius used his divination pool to view worlds and planes of reality that never came into existence.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>One of his most prized possessions was a Netherese book entitled Transubstantiality across Potentialities .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Diderius had at least one known apprentice, a young woman named Ilda who absolutely revered the old wizard. Unfortunately the two had a tragic falling out when Diderius came to believe that Ilda stole a valuable book from his collection.</p>
<p>He was known to have a large contingent of followers, and at least two warriors were known to have pledged their eternal existence to Diderius. They watched over his remains as wraiths for years after their deaths.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After his death, Diderius' followers converted an area of his mansion into a crypt for the old wizard. There, Diderius was entombed as a mummy lord , though neutral-aligned and in full possession of his faculties and wizardly spellcasting abilities. Four of his closest advisers were also mummified and posted as guards for their master, though this did not prevent the back chambers of the tomb from being colonized by a tribe of yuan-ti and their lizardfolk slaves many years later.</p>
