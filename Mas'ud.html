<p>Mas'ud was a healer from Al Qahera in Raurin as of 1374Â DR . He was the one to examine Feraih after she died; unable to find any cause for her death, he considered it to be the product of some curse sourced from the Palace of the Purple Emperor which she had just visited. He also provided care to Thormud Horn during his stay in Al Qahera: he judged he may have been affected by a similar affliction. He was Fadheela 's father.</p>
