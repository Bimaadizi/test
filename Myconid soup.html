<p>Myconid soup was an accidental culinary discovery of Geldorf Tinbasher , a stern dwarven chef from Thay , active in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Myconid soup was prepared by slowly simmering diced myconid flesh in a light stock for the duration of an entire day. The soup was lightly seasoned with salt before serving. Geldorf swore it was the best soup one could have.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Chef Tinbasher accidentally discovered the recipe after an acquaintance of his procured a chunk of myconid flesh for Geldorf to cook with as a joke. Ironically, the chef fell in love with the soup he created and was on an almost obsessive quest to get a piece of myconid known as the Concocter during his time working for Dennaton 's gladiatorial pits in Thay circa 1369 DR .</p>
