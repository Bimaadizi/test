<p>Braznioch was a lord of salamanders during the mid-1480s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar , Braznioch was summoned by the forces of Sschindylryn and used in the war. Though not affiliated with Lolth , it was more than happy to simply burn her enemies. When the Grove of the Great Tree was targeted for destruction, Braznioch was sent into battle, eager to raze the woodlands. Fortunately for the dryads , defenders from Cormyr met the drow in battle and defeated them and the salamander.</p>
