<p>The singing pendant was a unique enchanted amulet that belonged to Redfeyer of Rassatan in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The singing pendant was used by its owner to sing harmonies and be a backup singer in his performances. The item possessed a soft, soothing female voice. The pendant could be activated three times per day to release its soothing magics onto the listener.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was unknown where Redfeyer got his beloved singing pendant, but by the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , he used the item as his backup singer as he performed ballads of adventures in pubs and taverns of Rassatan. The necklace left Redfeyer's possession when it started singing during a spelunking expedition. The amulet's song alerted the cave's hungry wildlife, and Redfeyer was forced to flee, losing it in the process. The singing pendant was left alone in the cavern, sadly lamenting its loneliness. Redfeyer was attempting to find adventurers brave enough to retrieve the pendant for him from the dangerous caves. The sand singing echoing from the cave quickly gained reputation and given the name to the Singing Caverns .</p>
