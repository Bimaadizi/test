<p>The Cult of the Eyeless was a beholder cult active in Athkatla in around 1369 DR and in the city or Berdusk sometime before 1312 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Outwardly, its blind priests preached that all the gods were fakes, and that the only true one was the Unseeing Eye , whom the cult served. This helped it gain some followers among ordinary people who were disillusioned with the gods. In actual fact, the Unseeing Eye was a blind but immensely powerful beholder , who used the cult in its search for the second half of the Rift Device , an artifact of such great destructive power that the gods themselves had hidden it to prevent anyone from using it.</p>
