<p>Volkumburgh Vale was a valley nestled in the foothills of the Thunder Peaks , south of Thunder Gap .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Volkumburgh was a rugged, snowy valley. Where winters came early and were liable to have blizzards or ice storms. In the southern half of the valley, an area that was later known separately as the Vale of the Dragon Oracle , stood Mount Drakkor Rouge , a semi-extinct and partially flooded volcano.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 999 DR , the villa of the Cormyrian noble Lord Volkumburgh was established within this valley.</p>
<p>Around the 10 th century DR , members of the Cult of the Dragon came to the Thunder Peaks area. At Mount Drakkor Rouge they decided to set up base, as witches among the cell believed that the sulfurous vapors within the crater's lava caves would help them to divine the future — on its central rocky landmass they carved out what would later be known as the Temple of the Dragon Oracle . Some time between the Year of the Molten Man, 1151 DR and the Year of the Agate Hammer, 1174 DR , an evil force overran the temple and forced the cultists to abandon it.</p>
<p>In the mid-12 th century DR , King Proster Obarskyr ordered the College of Shaping Magics to construct a new breed of stone golems , designed to help expedite his building projects. In later centuries, this information could only be found in a single obscure government document in Suzail . The golem would be carved out from a cliff-face near the college by means of an enchanted carving knife .</p>
<p>Later that same year Volkumburgh Vale was sacked in a rampage by that same golem , leading to the destruction of both of the valley's magic colleges and Lord Volkumburgh's manor. The magic-users who survived the golem's rampage would scatter his pieces across the valley, entrusting one of its hands with Lord Volkumburgh and hiding its head within a volcanic vent inside the abandoned Temple of the Dragon Oracle.</p>
<p>Lord Volkumburgh's manor would go on to be rebuilt as the Crimson Wyrm , while the rest of its remains were used to construct the small village of Volkumburgh. Over the two centuries that followed the colleges' destruction, the residents of Volkumburgh would loot their ruins for valuables to either keep or sell.</p>
<p>In 1358 DR, the magic-user Amelior Amanitas set up a workshop in the village in the form of a huge tower, after a man named Lychor introduced him to to the fragmented legends of the golem, as well as some fragments of it, which he managed to merge back together into an arm through use of potions .</p>
