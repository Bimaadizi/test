<p>The Quomec Ziggurat , also sometimes called simply Quomec , was a large ziggurat that sat in the jungles of northern Chult .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The ziggurat stood twenty-eight levels tall. The exterior was inscribed with indecipherable glyphs, with the inscriptions near the base seeming to show a massive sarcophagus writhing with animated vines. At the top of the ziggurat sat a temple sealed behind enormous bronze doors.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , local tribes claimed that the ziggurat was the crypt of an emperor known as Lord Quomec , although that name had not been recorded in any texts.</p>
