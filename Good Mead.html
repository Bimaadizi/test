<p>Good Mead was one of the smaller of the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale . It sat on the northwestern shore of Redwaters , south of the Eastway trade road.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Two roads extended out from Good Mead, one that went southwest to Dougan's Hole and another one northeast to Easthaven .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>While Good Mead's economy was originally based on the fishing of knucklehead trout from nearby Redwaters lake, by the mid-14 th century DR they received little profit from
their catches. As a whole, the town focused on brewing their famous mead , that they sold in the merchant town of Bryn Shander .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>For many years, Good Mead and Dougan's Hole enjoyed a healthy rivalry with each other.</p>
