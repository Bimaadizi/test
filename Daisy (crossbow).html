<p>Daisy was the unique enchanted light crossbow that belonged to Vicalet Hawkeye the mage-killer sometime before 1281 DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Daisy possessed a potent +3 enchantment, and it made it significantly easier for the missiles shot out of the crossbow to reach their targets.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A renowned half-elven mercenary, Vicalet Hawkeye, named this enchanted crossbow for its ability to make its targets to "push up daisies ." Famous for his impeccable aim that killed quite a few wizards , Vicalet made a living by selling his services to various adventuring groups. Daisy was always at his side, sniping all spell-casters that Vicalet's employees might've missed. The mercenary's weapon always found its target when crafty wizards tried to protect themselves with the project image spell.</p>
<p>Vicalet Hawkeye retired a wealthy man and spent his later years working on his vineyard. Daisy was sold to an inexperienced and cocky human mercenary, but the ownership was short-lived, just like the mercenary himself. Over time this weapon changed hands until ending up in possession of the blacksmith Conlan in Kuldahar in 1281 DR.</p>
