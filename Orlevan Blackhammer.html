<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , Orlevan was thought to have unleashed or summoned the Cinnamon Dragon , an unidentified breed of dragon named for its brown scales. The creature appeared in the harbor, wrapped its prehensile tail around his houseboat, and carried it into the air, before obliterating it with its spells and lightning breath, with its ashes blown away on the wind. Orlevan was presumed slain in the act. Afterward, the dragon spat lightning bolts and summoned monsters at the crowds of witnesses gathered around the harbor, before it flew away over the sea.</p>
