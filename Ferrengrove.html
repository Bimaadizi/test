<p>Ferrengrove was a village of green elves in Semberholme .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ferrengrove was the sole home to a community of green elves in Semberholme. The village was a tree-dwelling community, reminiscent of similar settlements of the Tangled Vale to the east. Its strategic location near the northern patrols of the Moonshadows and the presence of majestic oak trees made it an ideal choice for these arboreal dwellers. Notably, the village's elevated houses were shrouded amidst the forest canopy, hidden even from the keen eyes of fellow elves below.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Renowned for their exceptional craftsmanship, the green elves of Ferrengrove gained acclaim for their superior bows and arrows, which they produced with meticulous skill. These coveted weapons found their way to the bustling markets of Myth Drannor and are also traded among the Moonshadows.</p>
