<p>Gloves of ice were enchanted hand-coverings suffused with the power of elemental ice .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The gloves were permanently encrusted with ice. Their wearer did not need to worry about this ice freezing their own hands.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>While wearing the gloves of ice , an individual could invoke their power either to enhance their attacks with the power of cold , or to have their blows ignore some of a foe's resistance to the cold.</p>
<p>The gloves could be used as a spell focus in an ancient Nar ritual to infuse an individual with primal magic , turning them into a literal force of nature. This ritual required several magic items as foci, also including a cloak of translocation , a versatile spellbook , and a circlet of mental onslaught .</p>
