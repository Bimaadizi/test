<p>The Torchriders were an independent militia in the lands of southeastern Amn in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Torchriders operated in the lands between the South Road of Amn and the Tethir Road , handling the countryside below the Tejarn Hills near Riatavin and Trailstone .</p>
<p>They were a loosely organized militia of mounted fighters that spread warning of attacks by raiders including goblins , hobgoblins , orcs , gnolls , and human deserters from the nearby Hillforts , and gathered up war-parties to respond to them in force.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The lack of a road between Hillfort Keshla and Riatavin meant a lack of overland trade, and the Council of Six determined that the area was unworthy of Council Army patrols. This lack of protection meant that bandits and warbands of humanoids were common, and the local farmers were forced to fend for themselves. Their response was the Torchriders, who allowed them to protect the region independent of the Council Army.</p>
