<p>Daisake Mayazato was a wu jen in the town of Aru in Wa in the late 1350s DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>As an effect of his old age, Daisake had become senile and became obsessed with some ideas or plans for no real reason.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some years before, he saved Moonlight , Smoke , and Snake of the Warazama ninja clan from a spirit folk ambush. They agreed to repay his help by working for him for five years.</p>
<p>He decided to ruin the Ceremony of the Three Thousand Steps at the Shining Temple of Bishamon , though he had no actual reason for it.</p>
<p>A citizen of Aru claimed that "Dosko" (as he misremembered the name) put a spell on him that sickened his right arm, though it had healed by Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR) .</p>
