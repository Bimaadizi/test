<p>Sathallarin was a moon elven wild mageliving in the mid 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was oft described as half crazy and took to wild magic due to his own inner feelings of unpredictability and powerfulness, both concepts that resonated with wild magic itself.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He wielded an enchanted +2 dagger , and a wand of wonder which, unlike most wands of that type, would create two or even three different effects whenever used.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Whenever he met others in his travels, he was as likely to attack them as to help them, that is, as long as he didn't foresee a great risk upon himself. Even with his capricious mentality, he would avoid situations that might lead to his own death.</p>
