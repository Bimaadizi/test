<p>A ninja-to ( pronounced : / n i n dʒ ɑː t oʊ / neen-jah-toh ) was the standard weapon of a ninja .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A ninja-to was a sword 2 feet (61 centimeters) in length, similar to a short sword , and was designed to be easily concealed. Unlike the katana , this sword featured a straight blade of somewhat lower quality. However, true to the ninja's tactical approach, both the sword and its scabbard possessed multiple functionalities, which varied among individual ninjas. For instance, some swords might contain concealed compartments in the hilt or tip of the scabbard, intended for carrying powders, poisons , or small daggers .</p>
<p>The scabbard, typically longer than the sword itself, was open at both ends, allowing it to double as a blowpipe or breathing tube. Additionally, a sturdy silk cord might be wrapped around the scabbard that was capable of being unraveled and utilized for climbing purposes. Due to its robust and rigid nature, the scabbard could even be used as a makeshift ladder rung.</p>
