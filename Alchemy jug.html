<p>An alchemy jug was a magical jug that could produce a variety of liquid substances on command.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Typical alchemy jugs were made of ceramic . They had an apparent capacity of 1 gallon (3.8 liters) and always made a sloshing sound when shaken, as if they were always filled with liquid.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The jug could produce the following substances: acid , ale , honey , mayonnaise , poison , oil , vinegar , fresh or salt water , wine , ammonia , aqua regia , beer , chlorine , and cyanide . The amount produced depended on the liquid chosen. Upon speaking the name of the substance, the user could uncork the jug to pour it, at a maximum rate of 2 gallons (7.6 liters) per minute.</p>
<p>Once an alchemy jug produced its maximum amount of a given liquid, it could only produce more of it after the next dawn.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>An alchemy jug was kept within Korinn's Keep , a Harper stronghold in the late 1490s DR. It was among the many items taken from their villainous enemies.</p>
