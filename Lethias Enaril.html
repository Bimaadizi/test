<p>Some time before the late 13 th century, the Hand of the Seldarine was besieged a monstrous horde of orcs and goblinoids . Lethias and his other elves fought to defend the fortress for days, but ultimately saw they would lose the battle. True to his oath, Lethias sacrificed his life by leading a great many of the invaders into the Hand. His fellow elves amassed a number of artifacts within one of the Hand's four towers and detonated them, collapsing the tower over Lethias and so many of the invaders.</p>
<p>Lethias' spirit lingered in the ruins of the Severed Hand, as the elven fortress was then called.</p>
