<p>Longsaddle was a sleepy little hamlet on the Long Road in the Savage Frontier of northwest Faerûn . Despite its small size, it was a member of the Lords' Alliance thanks to the presence of the powerful Harpell family of wizards .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Situated east of the Crags and west of the Evermoors , Longsaddle sat on an isolated stretch of the Long Road.</p>
<p>The surrounding area was a vast expanse of grassland that catered to the town's ranchers.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The hamlet's spokesperson on the council of the Lords' Alliance was Dowell Harpell as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Longsaddle was founded in the Year of the Reaching Beacon, 1042 DR , by Shardra Harpell , an escaped Calishite slave .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Bent Blade, 1376 DR , two separate sects of the Malarite faith wanted to set up churches by the waterfront of a magically created lake. The two churches immediately began fighting each other and the Harpells had to step in. Unfortunately, they couldn't get rid of them so instead they imposed a severe punishment on the more dangerous individuals: transmuting them permanently into harmless rabbits .</p>
<p>By the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the forest around Longsaddle was inhabited by werewolf descendants of Bidderdoo Harpell . These werewolves were called "the Bidderdoos" and although the townsfolk feared them, they provided some measure of protection for the town.</p>
<p>From 1479 DR until the end of the Year of the Narthex Murders, 1482 DR , the reincarnated Catti-brie , under the name of Delly Curtie , dwelt at the Ivy Mansion in Longsaddle, learning magic from the Harpells.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The community was famous for the presence of peculiar wizards who were eccentric and often dangerous in their spell-casting manners. The Blue Sigil mercenary company was located in nearby Mog's Keep .</p>
<h3>Notable Families</h3>
<p>As of the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , the hamlet consisted of around 1,000 or so people from the surrounding countryside. Among these were the Beliver, Cadrasz, Dostril, Emmert, Feldryn, Gosstal, Harpell, Irimari, Kromlor, Mammlar, Ostever, Sharnshield, Silverhand - Arunsun - Maerdrym , Stormrider, Suldivver, Zelorrgosz, and Del Goldwhite families.</p>
