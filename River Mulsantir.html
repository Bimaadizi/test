<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The northern section of the River Mulsantir flowed north into Lake Ashane while the southern section flowed west from the Sunrise Mountains to form Lake Mulsantir in southern Rashemen. The river formed part of the border between Rashemen and Thay as it passed through the Gorge of Gauros .</p>

<p>Mulsantir was located along the river's north shore where it flowed out of Lake Ashane and into Mulsantir Lake.</p>
