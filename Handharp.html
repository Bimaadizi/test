<p>A handharp was a rare magical musical instrument favored by traveling Harpers . In fact, these items were believed to have been initially crafted by traveling Harpers.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Handharps were wooden crescent-shaped instruments about the size of a man's hand. They were strung with enchanted metal strings.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The magical properties of these items could be used by anyone capable of playing a tune. When played, a handharp created four blue globes of light that behaved like the dancing lights spell . The person playing the handharp could direct these globes with passive concentration.</p>
<p>The magic of a handharp affected all undead within a 10‑foot (3‑meter) radius of the instrument, making it more difficult for them to strike and harm targets. Life-draining attacks from undead were also easier to resist within this radius. The magic also prevented any creature within the radius from being charmed . Any charmed creature walking into the radius would be stunned for as long as they remained near the handharp .</p>
<p>Once per day a handharp could be used to open a dimension door that could transport a single living target up to 90 feet (27 meters) away. This was activated by plucking a specific string while singing a specific note. Using this power prevented a handharp's other magic from functioning for ten minutes.</p>
<p>If carried by a bard , the area of effect for all of the handharp's magic was doubled, including the distance the dimension door could transport the user.</p>
