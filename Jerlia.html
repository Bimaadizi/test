<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Jerlia was human woman with pale skin and white hair. She wore a set of plate armor and carried a hefty war hammer .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jerlia's stall could be found in Athkatla's Center District – Waukeen's Promenade in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR . That year, the famed Athkatlan sculptor Sir Sarles sought pure illithium ore for a piece commissioned by the Church of Helm . Jerlia was the only ore merchant in Athkatla at the time who had access to the elusive material. Despite Sir Sarles's demands, Jerlia could only get her hands on up to 50 pounds (23 kilograms) of illithium ore per season through a duergar merchant, Unger Hilldark , operating out of the Copper Coronet .</p>
