<p>The Black Lion tribe was a group of Uthgardt barbarians from the Moonlands region of the Silver Marches . Unlike most of their fellow tribes, the Black Lions abandoned their typical lifestyle of nomadic hunting and raiding to establish a village around near their ancestral mound in Beorunna's Well .</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Forsaking their barbaric heritage, their agricultural advancement allowed the tribe to become a source of trade in the region. It was within the Black Lion community of huts and long houses the tribe found some contentment living as farmers and herders of livestock. They no longer faced violence and warfare on a regular basis.</p>
<p>In addition to forsaking the old ways of the north , the Black Lions no longer revered their totem animal or Uthgar . Many clerics of the tribe took up worship of Helm or the gods of the Triad .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid-14 th century DR the Black Lions had tired of constant fighting and sought less-violent lives. Under the leadership of Chief Andar Heartwood , they changed their lifestyle from migratory hunters to that of loggers, trappers and tradesmen. They opened trade with the cities Quaervarr and Sundabar to strengthen their hold as a regional power.</p>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Chief Claw led warriors of the tribe in the fight against the phaerimm that escaped from beyond the Sharn Wall . The Black Lion barbarians joined other fighting forces from across the Silver Marches and beyond to form the allied Army of the North .</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR , the Black Lion tribe often resorted to violent raids and pillaging. They targeted the smaller, weaker communities of the Silver Marches and the Druarwood .</p>
