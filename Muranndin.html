<p>Muranndin , also known formerly as Murannheim and the Sothillisian Empire , was a kingdom of ogres and orcs in the Lands of Intrigue in western Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The monster kingdom of Muranndin bordered Amn in the north via the Small Teeth Mountains , Tethyr's northern Wealdath forest in the east, and west with the Dragon's Head peninsula. This left the independent duchy of Velen isolated from the rest of Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The monarch of this kingdom was called the " Great Mur " or "Murkul", which usually was the chieftain of the strongest tribe. The Great Mur was responsible for essentially keeping the other tribes and bandits together and prevent infighting between them. Muranndin also collected tolls on all traffic along the Trade Way and its marauders roamed all nearby lands.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The kingdom had few qualms about seizing the wealth and goods that passed through or near their territory, however they were known to form secret arrangements to leave the caravans of select wealthy merchants alone in exchange for payment in either gold or weapons.</p>
<p>Slavery was the status quo since the foundation of the kingdom. The conquerors of the Murann city enslaved thousands of Amnians back in the 1370s and the descendants of those slaves served the ogres, orcs, and brigands of the area. A slave in Muranndin could fight his way out by showing martial skill or usefulness enough to impress either his owner or one of the chieftains.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The chieftains maintained scattered strongholds and keeps across the kingdom that were vital to secure the borders, especially with Amn since Muranndin was established on a great portion of Amnian soil and the High Houses offered bounties on ogres, trolls, and giants.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The kingdom of Muranndin existed since the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , when a duo of ogre mages , Sothillis and Cyrvisnea , led an army of monstrous humanoids and worshipers of Cyric against southern Amn in a conflict that would come to be known as the Sothillisian War . The official establishment of the kingdom, however, was after the successful siege of the southwest Amnian city of Murann in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , that eventually became its capital. As of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , it had become common knowledge that one of Amn's ruling Council of Six was present in the city when it was captured, and the Council had became increasingly concerned that this imprisoned councilor might have given away important information under duress.</p>
<p>During the early years, the kingdom was more commonly known as the "Sothillisian Empire" or as "Murannheim". In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , tlincallis emerged from sinkholes to attack Murann and settlements in Amn, and demanded repayment for treasures plundered from Maztica . That year, Sothillis of Muranndin and the Council of Six declared a truce and an alliance against the tlincallis of Oaxaptupa .</p>
<p>As of 1479 DR , Muranndin remained a constant threat to Amnian trade interests. In-fighting within the kingdom was common at this time, and the Great Mur wielded only nominal control over Muranndin's chieftains and bandit lords.</p>
