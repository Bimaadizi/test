<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR , she was in charge of the 40-strong Purple Dragons garrison of Thistleflame Keep in Suzail . When it appeared that Lord Partic Thistle had been mysteriously murdered, she secured the premises and deputized a group of adventurers to help find the perpetrators. She unintentionally provided the bard Mendryll Belarod with an alibi by spending the night with him, though she denied all involvement with him to save her professional reputation.</p>
<p>Her investigation ultimately uncovered the involvement of the Emerald Swords adventuring company, who had actually kidnapped Lord Thistle and murdered the doppelganger Xixis in his place. As it was "merely' kidnapping and not the murder of a noble, she had the authority to have the Swords exiled from Cormyr , rather than executed.</p>
