<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some years before the late 14 th century DR, very young Bubba and his brother Vimu were rescued by the Kukalatu warriors after their parents were killed by the dreaded leopard katangas . The saru duo were adopted by the tribe and raised as members of the community. In The Year of New Peoples of the Malatran calendar, a band of heroes of the Living Jungle was sent to the Kukalatu tribe by Chief Katar of the Koshiva to establish contact with the reformed cannibal and return with a special healing potion for the Chief's wife – Ootoo . A Kukulaturi hunting party was the first contact for the heroes who ran into them not far from the village. Warriors Bifu and e Jahi were the ones to meet the group in the open, while others – Gihu , Latu , Bubba and Vimu, stayed hidden, in case the strangers brought trouble.</p>
