<p>King Alemander I of the House of Ithal-Strohm-Bormul was the seventh king of the Lions' Dynasty of Tethyr . Called Alemander the Spellbinder , he was regarded as one of the Hero-Kings of Tethyr.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Alemander was a wizard before he became a monarch.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Alemander's sword, the Lion's Sword , was forged by a dwarven ally. Alemander later enchanted the blade, granting it the power of flame , a magical power that was rare at that time for weapons in Tethyr.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As king, Alemander I gave royal contributions to support the orders of Tormish and Ilmatari priests at Barakmordin , who had supported him in his rise to power. With these funds, the fortified abbey received its outer walls and a new central keep.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Alemander I was the oldest grandson of King Coram I . He had three sisters and a younger brother named Coram II , who for some reason lost to scholars, took the throne before him.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Alemander was born in 1038 DR . In 1050 DR , when Alemander was only a boy, his family was traveling with a caravan when they were attacked by a group of three wereboars . His father Natan died saving all of them.</p>
<p>In 1070 DR , Teremir Bormul started a coup against King Coram II, Alemander's brother. In the month of Kythorn , after a personal duel, Coram II was killed by Teremir, who took the throne as Teremir II and restored the dynasty of his great-grandfather. Before a year had passed, however, Alemander avenged his death and retook the throne for the Lions' Dynasty by the month of Ches .</p>
<p>In the first year of his reign, Alemander had all of Teremir's heirs executed.</p>
<p>In 1090 DR , King Alemander forced a treaty with King Imnel IV of neighboring Amn . As part of the treaty, Amn ceded all of its lands south of the Tethir Road to Tethyr in exchange for a large sum of money and military support against monsters in the region.</p>
<p>Alemander lived an exceptionally long life for a human, over 100 years, dying at last in 1145 DR . He was succeeded by his third-oldest great-grandson, Coram III .</p>
