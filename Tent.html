<p>A tent was a simple portable shelter designed for outdoor and wild environments.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Typical tents were made of canvas held standing by wooden poles and hempen rope that could be disassembled and packed during travels. Most tents could hold two occupants, but there were larger varieties. In desert regions tents occasionally featured extra sheets, known as "flies" (or " rihba'ids " in Midani ) , that helped to shade them and keep them cool, as well as deflected any sand blown from the tent itself. In Anauroch , these were typically only seen on the tents of wealthy members of the Bedine .</p>
<p>Two-person and six-person tents were available for purchase through Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue .</p>
<p>The largest type of tent was known as a pavilion . They were large, open-air canopies that could comfortably fit around twenty medium-sized humanoids .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
