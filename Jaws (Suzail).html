<p>The Jaws was the stream that fed into Lake Azoun and after entering a culvert, drained into Suzail 's commercial deepwater harbor called the Basin .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , the Jaws entered the city of Suzail from beyond its northeastern walls, trickled north and expanded into Lake Azoun on the southern side of Castle Obarskyr . From the lake, it hooked back north around the Court Close and moved back south until turning into a culvert on the opposite side of the block where the Winking Eye stood.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the Jaws' length was greatly shortened. The stream's culvert tunnel began between Castle Obarskyr
and Cormyr's Royal Court, with the rest of the stream paved and built over.</p>
