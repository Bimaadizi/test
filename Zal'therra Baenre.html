<p>Zal'therra Baenre was a cousin of Triel Baenre and commander of the rearguard of the Army of the Black Spider in 1372 DR . She was the most promising of Triel's cousins.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was a foot taller than Triel and was a good 30 pounds heavier.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Zal'therra was one of the most promising attendants of Triel. During the Silence of Lolth , when enemy armies marched to Menzoberranzan , Zal'therra was chosen as one of the commanders of the Army of the Black Spider , put in control of the rearguard. She was the highest-ranking House Baenre member of the army and Triel usually interacted with Zal'therra instead of the titular commander Mez'Barris Armgo .</p>
<p>In the battle against the armies of Gracklstugh at the Pillars of Woe , the army was betrayed by the plans of Nimor Imphraezl and House Agrach Dyrr sided with the invaders, causing the defeat of the drow.</p>
<p>Very disappointed with Zal'therra for not acknowledging the enemy's plan, Triel ordered her to block the enemy's path with her troops, gaining time for the majority of the army to retreat. This was considered a suicide mission and Triel commented that if it was Lolth 's will, Zal'therra would survive.</p>
