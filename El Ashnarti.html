<p>The Ashnarti family of crime lords was one of the smaller crime families in Calimshan , with its base in Keltar , and was known for its brutes and thugs.</p>
<p>The headquarters of the Guild of Enforcers and Thugs of Calimshan was located in Keltar and was the only rogues' guild of note in the city. In 1370 DR , this guild was in the control of the sultan of Keltar, Duncan el Ashnarti , allowing him to control both illegal and legal activity there. Duncan was married to a niece of el Ahimar family, one of the four major crime families in Calimshan , which was in turn subservient to el Pesarkhal family and the syl-pasha himself, so the entire Ashnarti family and the underworld of Keltar was in control of Ralan el Pesarkhal .</p>
