<p>Viconia's priestess robe was a powerfully enchanted Sharran robe worn by Mother Superior Viconia De Vir of the Cloister of Sombre Embrace in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Viconia's robes were black like Shar 's heart but decorated with silver metallic motifs, including a stylized shape of a spider on her open décolleté and dark golden patterns on the fabric.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The robes hummed with dark enchantments that dulled the senses, thoughts, and feelings of those around them. If one listened to the hum for a prolonged period of time, one could almost hear the chittering of a thousand spiders being devoured by a hungry darkness. It possessed a +1 protective enchantment, and Shar's umbrae magic wrapped the wearer in darkness, making it easier for them to dissolve into the shadows. It also possessed a permanent Sharran veil enchantment that functioned similarly to the shield of faith spell .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Viconia De Vir came to possess her unique robes sometime before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , when she was always seen wearing the Sharran garb whilst surrounded by the faithful of the Cloister of Sombre Embrace.</p>
