<p>The Tethyamar mining outpost was one of many outlying bases on the southern edge of the mines of Tethyamar , which found use again in the 15 th century DR by the expedition of Hal Stoutheart that sought to exploit the jewels of ardor .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The outpost was placed inside a spacious cavern that also contained a small waterfall and pool. A variety of structures were carved into the walls of the cavern, including storage for supplies, a stable for oxen , and a small tavern and eatery. In the middle of the outpost was a tower or keep that nearly reached the ceiling, from which Hal Stoutheart addressed the assembled dwarves with fiery, optimistic speeches.</p>
<p>The outpost sat at an intersection of many tunnels and shafts, giving it access to a wide area underground. These locations included Mineshaft 214S , Ironvale Deep , the expansive Eastern Reaches and Blue Stone Cavern , and a nearby hidden drow stronghold .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The expedition to mine the jewels of ardor and reclaim Tethyamar began with the demon lord Graz'zt , who took the identity of the long-dead Hal Stoutheart for himself. Posing as the explorer, he gathered up interested dwarves by sharing tales of legendary riches and beguiling them with subtle demonic magics to stoke their greed and ambition. He intended to lure them into Tethyamar so that they would either be destroyed or dragged down to his level.</p>
<p>Once they had enough numbers, the expedition set off for Tethyamar and began enthusiastically rebuilding the outpost while searching for the jewels of ardor. Arman Argentine went to Eveningstar and worked as a recruiter, showing off samples of the jewels of ardor to entice the locals. One group of adventurers agreed to take a chance on the expedition, traveling the hundreds of miles from Cormyr to Tethyamar. At the same time, House Argith of Sschindylryn launched their own effort into Tethyamar, seeking wealth and glory for themselves by attacking and enslaving the dwarves.</p>
<p>The elder Asta the Deep-Minded followed her nephew to Tethyamar and kept an aloof and critical eye on the expedition, well aware of the strange behavior going on. When Arman's recruits arrived, she wrangled the surfacers into helping her help the others, by keeping the dwarves alive and gathering more information about what was really going on. She had them work with Hagen Silverthumb , Eluf the Steadfast , Gunhild the Watchful , and Freygar Plumbline as they struggled against the Argith drow and their own natures. Finally, Inger Ingersdottir reported that Hal had gone missing in the Eastern Reaches, and sent the team after him. Instead of the expedition leader, they found a gauntlet of challenges including the illusion of Faraway , all created by the revealed Graz'zt. After a cursory battle, the demon lord abandoned his schemes and departed to parts unknown.</p>
<p>With the revelation of Graz'zt's manipulations and the end of the jewel's influence, the dwarves were left stunned and confused, unsure what to do without the grand goal they had driven themselves into a frenzy for.</p>
