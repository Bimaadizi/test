<p>The Howling Gap was a passage between the Teyla Shan and the Raurin Alta mountains, and was the primary trade passage between Semphar and the east.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Created by the space between the Teyla Shan and the Raurin Alta mountain ranges, too broad to be considered a pass, the Howling Gap sat along the Silk Road that connected Semphar to the lands of Shou Lung , and served as the primary route of travel between the two nations.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>No one was sure how the Howling Gap got its name, but there were a number of theories, including:</p>
<p>It was known that the gap had a history of caravans disappearing within, with others being attacked, and survivors claiming to have been attacked by something in the wind, and entire garrisons stationed there being destroyed mysteriously.</p>
<p>Due to all these rumors, no one tried to occupy or settle this region.</p>
<p>During the Tuigan invasion of Semphar, the Gap was one of two main routes used by the Tuigan Hubadai Khahanto invade the nation. The Tuigan, being a superstitious people, did not attempt to garrison people in the gap.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Djinn lived in the pass, and attacked travelers under the guise of dust storms to confuse their victims.. While they weren't always successful in these attacks, their defeat did nothing to limit their numbers, or lower their hostility. It was unknown if they were there of their own volition, or if they were bound by the Imaskari.</p>
