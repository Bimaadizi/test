<p>Forging Success was a self-help book of dubious nature that promoted the Sharran House of Grief of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>The book claimed to be able to help those who sought to break a cycle of lie and deceit. It diminished what some would call an art form to be nothing but self-delusion. The book's long-winded text offered the reader treatments pioneered by the House of Grief and, in the end, was nothing but an advertisement for the House of Grief's services.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the 1492 DR , Forging Success could be found in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate and was available in the House of Grief.</p>
