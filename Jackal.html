<p>Jackals were common desert canines. Some desert tribes considered the jackal a natural example of wisdom and cunning.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Jackals, like other small dogs, hunted in packs, of about one to six animals, but usually, they scavenged for their food. They were not very brave animals and were not typically aggressive.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Jackals were known to inhabit the Calim Desert during the time of the city of Cursrah . , the Lonely Moor , the land of Amn . and the Raurin desert.</p>
