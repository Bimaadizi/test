<p>The Temple of Leira was a place of worship dedicated to Leira , the goddess of lies, located in Bezantur , Thay .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This small temple was located near the waterfront in southeastern Bezantur, the so-called "City of a Thousand Temples". Appropriately, it was surrounded by other temples, notably the Temple of Myrkul to the west, temples of Tempus and Tyr to the north, and the Temple of Gond to the east.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The priests who maintained the temple wore masks to keep their identities anonymous. They were not well-liked in Bezantur because of their reputation for lying constantly. Their hierarchy and leadership—if indeed they had any—was not known by the people.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Leira was never widely venerated in Thay—with the possible exception of illusionists —and her temple in Bezantur was not the primary place of her worship in the realm, which was instead centered in Eltabbar .</p>
<p>After the disappearance of Leira following the Time of Troubles , the priests of the temple continued to be granted spells . As their goddess was assumed to be dead, it was rumored that some other deity was granting these powers.</p>
