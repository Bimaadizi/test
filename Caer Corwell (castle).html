<p>Caer Corwell was a castle that had long been the seat of the Kendrick kings of Corwell on the island of Gwynneth in the Moonshae Isles . It overlooked the small city of Corwell , sometimes also known as "Caer Corwell" in honor of the castle. The castle was in ruins as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The keep was located on a rocky cliff several hundred feet high that overlooked the common fields of Corwell and the waters of the harbor.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The castle was surrounded by a high wooden palisade which ended in a stone gatehouse. The front gates of the castle were made of strong wood and an iron portcullis was lowered from the gatehouse, which had four stout watchtowers. Rising above the courtyard, the central keep was protected by three parapeted towers.</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, the castle was a crumbling shell of its former self, and the roof had caved in.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Within the keep, Caer Corwell had a huge hall with two great oak tables and a large fireplace in the corner.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to the fall of the kingdom of Corwell, the banner of the Kendrick family (a silver bear on a black field) hung in splendor from the tallest point of the castle.</p>
<p>Corwell fell in the early 15 th century DR when the fey of Sarifal expelled all humans from the island of Gwynneth. The Kendricks who still resided at the castle were killed.</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, the ruins of the castle had come to be occupied by a mad gnome known as Phillwyp the Wary , alongside his boggart minions, who aspired to rule a kingdom of unseelie fey . During this time, High King Derid Kendrick of Callidyrr aspired to reclaim his family's ancestral seat.</p>
