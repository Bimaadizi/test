<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A serving of sauce was sufficient to smother a large meal of raw oysters , enough to feed a very hungry patron. It started with a large, tart greenheart apple being peeled and diced, then mashed and mixed with a spoonful of crushed black pepper , a pinch of dried mustard , and a half-cup of of red- wine vinegar . A handful of shallots or scallions were then minced and mixed in, along with a half-cup of apple cider and finally a pour of zzar or almond sherry . The mixture was then chilled for an hour and then stirred before being spooned onto the chilled, raw, half-shell oysters.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>The sauce was made in large cauldrons by low-ranking kitchen staff at the Platter of Plenty, alongside a multitude of other sauces that doused the meals of the Platter.</p>
