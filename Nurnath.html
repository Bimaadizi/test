<p>Nurnath was a farmer in Red Larch circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . He raised chickens in barns he owned just north of the town on the Long Road . His large barn with a green tile roof was a landmark on the road. Turning east at the barn onto a well-used cart track took a traveler between Mragan Gulther 's orchards and the grazing pasture of Indurr Stalnstern for about a mile before it climbed the hill where Old Angrath's Smokehouse was located.</p>
