<p>Skulto Mreth was a wizard and a member of the slavery and crime syndicate known as the Tarntar . His specialty was illusion spells.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was hard to describe because he used disguises and illusions to mask his rather ordinary features.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Skulto was a very private man because he led a very dangerous life, and protecting his secrets was of utmost importance to prevent his many enemies from getting revenge. He was always prepared in case disaster should strike and looked at everything with a dispassionate eye. He was cool under pressure and not easily excited.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He was a master of disguise and coupled this with his skill as an illusionist to create personas throughout the Moonsea region for his many secret business investments.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He collected enchanted whips to use on his slaves.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime around the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , Skulto was traveling with some other members of the Tarntar and had stopped at the Whistling Wizard inn in Voonlar . While observing the small-town milieu of the common room, in walked none other than Elminster himself, bantering with his compatriots in a most familiar manner. Skulto was quite taken aback when the Sage of Shadowdale suggested he check his slave ledgers because his employees were skimming profits for themselves. After Elminster couldn't get any more rises out of his tongue-tied audience, he sat on Hastammer Orlim 's lap and shapeshifted into a beautiful woman, precipitating an all-out attack on the imposter. Thus began the conflict known as the Battle at the Bar .</p>
<p>During the battle, the bar from which they had recently been served drinks, exploded, killing one of Skulto's cohorts instantly. Another powerful ally was beheaded for treachery in the face of mercy, and then the local law showed up. This caused a pause in the hostilities and Skulto and the rest of the surviving Tarntar fled the scene.</p>
