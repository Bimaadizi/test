<p>Listle Onopordum was a living illusion spell turned elf illusionist living in Phlan in the Moonsea in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Listle was originally a simple illusion spell created by the evil elf mage Sifahir to guard his treasure, but somehow, either by its magical power or some spontaneous change, she became self-aware and gained a sense of morality. She stole a powerful magical ruby pendant made by gnome illusionists that granted her life. Then she escaped, rescuing Sifahir's prisoners as she left.</p>
<p>Later in life, she became an illusionist herself and went to the city of Phlan and apprenticed to the wizard Shal Desanea . Later she joined her friend and later husband Kern Desenea on his quest to retrieve the Hammer of Tyr taken by the dark god Bane . With her fellow Heroes of Phlan, she was instrumental in destroying the Pool of Twilight that was terrorizing the city. In the process, Kern healed Listle, and by Tyr 's grace, brought her full life.</p>
<p>Her husband Kern was one of the paladins from Phlan attending the wedding ceremony for the Open Lord Piergeiron the Paladinson of Waterdeep in 1371 DR . The wedding was a disaster that resulted in the bride's abduction. The attending paladin heroes were recruited by Khelben Arunsun to be a part of the rescue mission. Both Listle and Evaine wanted to join their husbands on the adventure, but time was essential and traveling to Waterdeep would've taken days. The women stayed behind wishing their partners the blessings of Tyr.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>She became the wife of Kern Desanea.</p>
<p>Listle was friends with Evaine , the magic-user wife of Miltiades . The women bonded over their husbands' close friendship and camaraderie as paladins of Tyr.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Listle was a fun-loving, spirited, and upbeat woman with a streak of fiery temper. She used to mercilessly make fun of her husband, thanks to his student, young Harloon , who followed the paladin around showering him with admiration like a puppy dog.</p>
