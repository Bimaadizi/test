<p>Breeches , also known as britches and occasionally as pants , were a form of outergarment for humanoid races. They covered the hips and legs, all the way down to the knees.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Breeches came in a wide variety of styles, colors, and materials. Those sold from Aurora's Emporium were known to have a draw-string waist, allowing the wearer ease in adjusting them, as well as double stitching for extra strength. They were often worn alongside some form of codpiece .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Though the exact date of their invention on Toril was unknown, breeches dated back to the days of the Netheril empire. Netheril breeches had a style distinct from that of breeches in the Present Age .</p>
<p>In 1491 DR , members of the Cult of the Eternal Flame took up residence beneath a ruined temple of Cyric in Mulmaster . There they wore leather aprons and breeches as they worked at braziers to sacrifice people as part of a process to reanimate azer .</p>
<h2>Varieties</h2>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Up until the late 15 th century DR , breeches were generally considered a form of clothing reserved for men. By the late-15 th century it was commonplace for both men and women across the Realms to wear breeches, often of the leather variety.</p>
<p>Some people believed that breeches were a sign of civilized society, at least according to Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue .</p>
