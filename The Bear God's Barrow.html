<p>The Bear God's Barrow was a cavern within a barrow mound in Rashemen , guarded by telthor and elementals , about one day's travel on foot from the Mulsantir city gates. The bear god Okku kept a watch over the place. The Kalach-Cha was bound here when Safiya found him.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Traditional offerings to the spirits that dwelt in the Bear God's Barrow were brought in leather pouches and consisted of dried meats and herbs that were burned during a ritual.</p>
<h2>Imaskari Workshop</h2>
<p>An ancient underground Imaskari workshop was connected to the underground. It may have been found by Safiyah and the Kalach-Cha. According to Safiya, the ruin was no doubt Imaskari in origin, and the hill was a city in ages past; the area must've been uncovered by accident by the earth tremors from stirring spirits when she broke out the Kalach-Cha. Helmed horrors kept watch over the workshop, accompanied by a few animated weapons. An incomplete Imaskari golem , which Safiya dated as from the late Quyun dynasty, lay amongst the ruins. Safiya knew how to animate it, though she did not have a way of getting it to stay animated beyond the barrow.</p>
<p>Besides a smattering of scrolls, notable treasures in the workshop included a Mage protector , a Breastplate of Hidden Imaskar , and an Imaskari rod .</p>
