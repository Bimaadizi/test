<p>Myrmidons were consummate soldiers, being disciplined fighters that served in standing armies, city guards, or earned their living as mercenaries -for-hire.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>As a result of the highly disciplined and militaristic lifestyle they practiced, myrmidons carried themselves in a distinct manner. They could seldom blend in with the crowd and were usually easily recognizable by passers by.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>These individuals often possessed skills befitting a life of warfare, including the use and maintenance of myriad weapons and those needed to survive out in the wilderness.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Due to their skill and acumen with warfare, myrmidons were often employed by rich and influential patrons, granting them perks and opportunities not always afforded to other soldiers or swords-for-hire. Those that continued to serve in armies were often beyond the usual laws that governed the behavior of everyday citizens. In either circumstance, myrmidons served at the discretion of others, and were weighed down by the burdens of obligation and duty.</p>
