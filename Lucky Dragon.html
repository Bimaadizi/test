<p>The Lucky Dragon was a dimly-lit gambling house in Jester's Green that catered to the local Purple Dragons .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Seats could be rented at the gaming tables for 1 gp per hour, regulated by an intricate water clock that chimed at the top of the hour, though Purple Dragons paid half as much. Poor ale and worse wine was served in large clay cups for 4 cp per serving, and local girls could be hired as company for gamblers who needed some comfort.</p>
<p>A variety of games were played there, mainly ones that were popular with Purple Dragons wherever they were stationed. They included Toss the Dagger , Traitor's Heads , and Swords and Shields .</p>
