<p>Emberosa was a fire giant in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime prior to 1492 DR, Emberosa and her six fire giant kin came to Arcturiadoom on a mission to dethrone the storm giants of Faer√ªn within the giants ' ordning . They originally sought an ancient rune of power created some 40,000 years before the Second Sundering , which they believed was stolen by dwarves and taken to their domain beneath Mount Waterdeep .</p>
<p>However, it was Halaster Blackcloak who possessed the rune and he agreed to give it to Emberosa in exchange for her services using their exceptional metal-forging abilities to build a giant construct for him.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Within the central hall of Arcturiadoom, the fire giants gathered scrap metal from Trobriand's Graveyard and began construction on an enormous magical iron automaton called Mecha-Halaster . This 100-foot (30.5-meter) tall machine was the near-exact duplicate of Halaster himself, though by 1492 DR, it was still incomplete. The Mad Mage intended to use this colossus to combat the Walking Statues of Waterdeep when the time arrived to conquer the surface city. Emberosa supervised the project.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Emberosa was a very irritable individual.</p>
<h2>Relationship</h2>
<p>During their excursion into Undermountain, Emberosa and her fire giants were accompanied by the Death's Head Phalanx band of hobgoblins , led by the Warlord known as Doomcrown . She had always at her side her three smoke mephit assistants.</p>
