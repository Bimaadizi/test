<p>Mensel of Cormyr was a nobleman and a Lord of Immersea , who ruled many years before the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In life, Lord Mensel was known as a kind, generous, and humanitarian-to-a-fault nobleman. He was universally beloved by his family, servants, and subjects. Mensel died of old age in his sleep.</p>
<p>Later, however, his family discovered a secret vault underneath the Lord's study. It was filled with a small hoard of treasure that was claimed by Mensel's heirs. One item of note in the hoard was the book called the Obscene Grimoire . The tome and its past owners remained largely a mystery, and a century after Lord Mensel's death, countless rumors and legends grew around the sinister black tome.</p>
<p>One rumor of note came from an Arabelan seer , who claimed that Lord Mensel fashioned the Obscene Grimoire for personal use at great expense and ordered everyone involved with the book's creation murdered. Despite this story's dubious authenticity, the legend nevertheless damaged Mensel's name and his family's reputation.</p>
