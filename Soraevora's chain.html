<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This beautiful 20‑pound (9.1‑kilogram) chainmail was expertly crafted by elven artisans of Evermeet and tailored specifically to Soraevora Aeravand 's body. The chainmail was decorated with a tabard that hid underneath a chain that held the holy symbol of Angharradh in front of the wearer's heart. The armor possessed a +2 protective enchantment , gave them limited spell resistance, and improved the wearer's reflexes. The magical divine nature of Soraevora's chain ensured that it could only be worn by a favored soul who was an elf and who was both good and chaotic in spirit.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This chainmail's existence predated the 14 th century DR , likely by many centuries. The armor was worn a favored soul of Angharradh: the sun elf named Soraevora Aeravand of Evermeet. In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Soraevora's deity sent her visions of doom and the elf embarked on a journey to the Sword Coast North to stop Zehir , a yuan-ti interloper deity. Soraevora's chain accompanied her on the perilous quest.</p>
