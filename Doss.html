<p>The College of Doss was a traditional bardic college from Berdusk .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The Doss lute , one of the Instruments of the Bards , was named after this college and had been created by the legendary bard Falataer to test and reward his students who achieved mastery of the Doss level of skill. The powers of the original Doss lutes could only be properly wielded by bards of at least the Doss college: bards of lower levels of skill could only obtain limited results.</p>
<p>The Doss lyre was also named after the college.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The College of Doss was one of the seven elder bardic colleges dating back to Falataer, who had established it as the third level, also known as the Doss level, of his bardic college. Following this tradition, bards studying to obtain the rank of Magna Alumnae attended all seven colleges, with Doss being the third, after Mac-Fuirmidh and before Canaith . However, this practice was abandoned once the original colleges declined.</p>
