<p>The Ruby Blades were a Sembite adventuring company that operated circa 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the Ruby Blades were summoned by their allies, the Wolfmasters , to join them in a dangerous expedition into the Vast Swamp to loot Orvaskyte Keep . The Ruby Blades were delayed, and by the time they arrived the Wolfmasters had been slain by a cornugon devil . Running into Cormyrean adventurers sent by Lord Partic Thistle to find the Wolfmasters, the Ruby Blades abandoned the Orvaskyte Keep mission, instead turning to hunting a local black dragon . Utterly outclassed, they fled with the dragon in pursuit, only to be saved by the Cormyrean adventurers. They were then reinforced by two-dozen Sembian mercenaries, and went on to secure Orvaskyte Keep for their own delving.</p>
