<p>The Coddled Cuticle was a distinguished hairdressing and manicure salon in Eileanar .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The owner Qipley was an expert hairdresser, manicurist, and beautician, favored by folk from the lower middle-class all the way up to the astoundingly wealthy and powerful. To perform his craft he used tools such as alchemical lotions and balms that eliminated wrinkles, and fine abrasive pads for polishing nails to perfection. Though hard-working folk tended to regard him and his profession with disdain, Qipley almost always had a tenday or two of bookings filled up at any moment.</p>
