<p>Humans on Toril were widespread, could be found in most regions and, in general, were fierce and disagreeable, which could sometimes lead certain other races to view them with contempt. They were renowned for their diversity and ambition, and although they lacked specialization, they could excel in many areas.</p>
<h2>Etymology</h2>
<h3>Names for Humans</h3>
<p>Many races had their own unique terminology by which they referred to humans. Elves and halfling were known to call them the manyhanded , in reference to an old elven insult the "Manyhanded Curse," while orcs referred to them as the brittle bones . Brownies , halflings, korreds , and satyrs were all known to use the term hurbryn , meaning "heavy-footed." Treants referred to humans as oroosh , meaning "never-stopping-talkers." Dragons referred to them as munthrek and in the Giant language they were known as van .</p>
<h2>Ethnicities</h2>
<p>There was great ethnic diversity between humans in different regions.</p>
<h3>Faerûn</h3>
<p>The following were the most prevalent and largest ethnic groups to be found in Faerûn during the last two millennia of the Age of Humanity continuing into the Era of Upheaval . They were by far the most common ethnicities found within the Heartlands of Faerûn .</p>
<h3>Kara-Tur</h3>
<h3>Maztica</h3>
<p>The native Mazticans lived on a continent west of the Trackless Sea .</p>
<h3>Minor ethnic groups</h3>
<p>The following are ethnic groups which were either small in number, or who were most commonly found in lands far from Faerûn's heartlands. In their own distinct regions, they might very well be the major local ethnic people.</p>
<p>Some ethnic groups were no longer present on Toril:</p>
<p>Other ethnic groups of humans were referred to by the continent on which they lived:</p>
<h3>Related races</h3>
<p>While natural subraces of humans were rare, a few did exist with either natural or unnatural origins and were considered as such because of unique biological or magical quirks not common to most humans, such as the skulk , abbalaya , and elans . Humans bred outside their race many times, resulting in the various half-human races like half-elves and half-orcs as well as planetouched such as aasimars , genasi , and tieflings .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The origin of humanity was unknown. Although the Tel-quessir could claim the primal war between Corellon and Gruumsh for their heritage and the dwarves claimed to have been forged from the rocks of Abeir-Toril itself, humans had no unifying creation myth. However, they were certainly an ancient race, having originated since before written records existed and were frequently considered one of the creator races , though they weren't known to have actually created any species. More confusing yet was that, while humans indeed were native to Toril, they had been found on other worlds as well, with the Mulani standing out as an example of human immigrants to Toril.</p>
<p>During the Days of Thunder ( −35,000 DR to −30,000 DR ) on the supercontinent of Merrouroboros , humans were a primitive race, similar to apes. Tribes of humans largely inhabited the land later known as the continent of Katashaka . They used simple tools, banged rocks together to make fire, and dwelled in caves. According to Bazim-Gorag , a batrachi (another of the creator races) they hid in caves in fear—he called them "Meat".</p>
<p>Regardless of their precise origins, humans were undeniably successful. While hardly the only dominant race of Toril, humans were one of them and the most recent to obtain dominance. In spite of this strength, or perhaps because of it, humanity was an eternally fractured and divided race, broken up into over a dozen ethnic offshoots. It was believed that this was in part because humanity, unlike most other races, did not emerge as a whole but rather in several places at once, thereby resulting in its diversity.</p>
