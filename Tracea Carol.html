<p>Tracea Carol was a conjurer who led a demonic cult in Ulgoth's Beard during the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Tracea and her fellow cultists worshiped a nabassu known as Aec'Letec . They believed the fiend to be their god and revered it as such.</p>
<p>She was prone to "fever-dreams" during which she believed Aec-Letec spoke to her directly.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>For many years Tracea and her followers prepared for the day they could release Aec'Letec onto Faerûn . In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , they actively sought out the Soultaker dagger in order to destroy it and release the demon. While they were not strong enough delve into Durlag's Tower to retrieve the artifact, they waited until the adventurer Abdel Adrian did so at the behest of Hurgan Stoneblade .</p>
<p>When Abdel returned to meet Hurgan at Ulgoth's Beard, Tracea's devotees stole the dagger in order to perform the ritual to conjure forth Aec'Letec. While they were successful in this endeavor, both the demon and its cultists were defeated by Abdel and his companions.</p>
