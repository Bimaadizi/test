<h2>History</h2>
<p>Akkabar was destined to rule over Calimshan as sole heir of Syl-Pasha Akkabar the Elder's throne. He plotted along with his grandfather how to absorb the kingdom of Tethyr into Calimshan; however, he never saw these plans come to fruition, as he was assassinated in −1 DR in what was made to look like a bar brawl. His murderers were Tethyrian clansmen seeking revenge for the death of King Amahl I. This political upheaval caused much suffering in Tethyr, as Akkabar's son Amahl II currently ruled Tethyr as a puppet king.</p>
