<p>The Vault of Golden Commerce was the central temple of the Church of Nephthys .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This temple was located in the nation of Mulhorand , in the wealthy city of Neldorild .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Vault was a massive, long rectangular structure constructed of white marble . It lacked windows, had a steeply sloping roofing, and only a large single set of doors at one end. Before this door stood a massive colonnade and leading up to it from the streets was a steep set of stairs.</p>
<h3>Interior</h3>
<p>The interior of the temple was painted with the blood of dragons and gorgons , then enspelled with numerous wards.</p>
<p>Inside the Vault was host to vast galleries of art pieces, statuary, and tapestries from all across Toril . These were all illuminated by a golden radiance given off by continual light spells . Within the lower levels of the Vault, legendary wealth amounts of wealth were stored.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The clergy of this temple acted as the administrative body of Neldorild. They also oversaw, alongside the city's Thothian clergy, the nearby papyrus slave farms along the delta of the River of Spears . This generated a great deal of wealth for both clergies.</p>
<p>On a bi-weekly schedule, the priestesses of the Vault held revels that were considered to be the pinnacle of the social calendar among those in Neldorild. They served as a great way to generate revenue for the church, as wealthy merchants and the nobility could only enter the Vault if they paid a hefty fee.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The entrance to the Vault was guarded by a pair of iron golems .</p>
