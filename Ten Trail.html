<p>The Ten Trail was a trail that connected the Ten Towns to the southern edge of the Frozenfar and the rest of Faer√ªn .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The trail began in the city of Fireshear and headed north through a pass along the Spine of the World as far as Bryn Shander . Travel through the Ten Trail was risky not only because of the low temperatures, since travelers along the road were also threatened by brigands, crag cats , orcs , yetis and even white dragons .</p>
<p>On its northern leg past the mountains, the trail was known as the Caravan Trail and led up to the South Gate of Bryn Shander.</p>
<p>The mountain portion of the trail was almost impassable during the winter. At its highest elevation, the trail passed through the town of Hundelstone .</p>
<p>South of the Spine of the World, the Iron Trail connected the Ten Trail to the city of Ironmaster , but that trail practically disappeared during the winter. Further along its southern leg, the trail also connected to the Northern Means , which headed towards Luskan .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The Ten Trail was used by caravans to move goods to and from the cities in Icewind Dale . Because of its various dangers, caravans needed to be well armed for the trip.</p>
