<p>Stoner's Needle , also called Needle Rock , was a rocky spire in the Sword Coast lands.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The extraplanar monster Imgig Zu placed a Lockstone with a frozen greater basilisk as guardian on the summit of Stoner's Needle. This Lockstone would restore Jogaoh , who had escaped Imgig Zu's captivity, to his original form, but Jogaoh feared the basilisk too much to make the climb up and take the Lockstone. Instead, Jogaoh made his home close to the spire, and made a name for himself as a smith who could work magic .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Vajra Valmeyjar , Cybriana , Timoth Eyesbright , Onyx the Invincible , and Priam Agrivar sought out the famed dwarf smith Jogaoh for his services. Jogaoh agreed to help, provided the companions retrieved the Lockstone from atop Stoner's Needle. Jogaoh accompanied the heroes to the stony spire. They camped for the night at the base of the Needle, but close to dawn they were attack by ghoul warriors that clawed their way out of the earth.</p>
<p>After defeating the undead , Vajra, Priam, and Jogaoh ascended the rocky tower, with Vajra carrying Jogaoh on her back and pulling up the weakened Priam. Reaching the summit, Jogaoh revealed his story and took the Lockstone. The magical gem restored the dwarf to his true form as a fire elemental . Jogaoh returned to his own plane, leaving Vajra and Priam to face the now-awakened basilisk. Vajra slew the basilisk, using the reflection of the gem so it would turn itself to stone, saving Priam.</p>
