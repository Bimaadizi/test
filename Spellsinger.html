<p>Spellsingers (also known as song mages or, in the case of cleric / bard spellsingers, circle dancers ) were rare practitioners of an ancient elven bardic tradition.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Spellsingers were almost always bards (or multi-classed bards, particularly wizard /bard). They were usually elves living in elven homelands, but there were a few half-elven spellsingers and at least one human ( Danilo Thann ) with distant elven heritage. Spellsingers had the ability to be a part of the Weave , as opposed to bards alone, who accessed the Weave through their music and poetry. In that way, spellsingers were much more flexible than bards and could become more powerful.</p>
<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>Spellsingers had an ability to use spellsong , enabling them to replace a memorized spell with an enchantment of lower level. Spellsong always required verbal (singing) and somatic (playing an instrument) components. Spellsingers were considered specialists for spells from the school of song .</p>
