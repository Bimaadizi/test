<p>Lavlaryn was a caravan guard in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lavlaryn was one of the caravan guards for Orthil Voldovan in the trip from Scornubel to Waterdeep late in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR . After an ambush, he was one of the guards searching the wagons for dangerous contraband; in particular, he searched Mhegras and Sabran 's wagon but found only peles , large shovels meant for bakery. He still kept a bowgun trained on the contrabandists until Orthil Voldovan took a look at these, to make sure they weren't anything dangerous.</p>
