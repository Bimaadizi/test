<p>The Cadorna family sword was an enchanted commemorative greatsword created for the famous, or rather infamous "dragon killer family" of Phlan , House Cadorna .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The greatsword was a masterfully crafted cold iron blade. It was decorated with intricately engraved ornamentations along the blade, some of which were damaged by use throughout the years. The greatsword's blade on one side contained an engraved Cadorna family history that began with a weaver's loom and ended in a grand dragon battle. The other side held an engraved family tree with the last engraving as of 1351 DR on its hilt reading: "To Skullcrusher, For All Your Service – P. Cadorna, 1351 DR."</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>As the Cadorna family sword was made out of cold iron, the blade was deadly to fey creatures, celestial eladrin , and demons . It also possessed a simple +1 enchantment that guided the wielder's hand and ensured increased damage with each slash. The sword's edge was ensorcelled with a keen magic that kept it sharp and gave it the potential to deal especially devastating damage.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Cadorna family sword was forged to commemorate the 15 th anniversary of the Cadorna family becoming famous and respected after Magnus Cadorna slew a dangerous red dragon who ravaged settlements of the Dragon Reach . When it was presented to Magnus, now an eighty-two-year-old man, he was thankful but considered the gesture quite silly.</p>
<p>The blade would remain with the Cadorna family, passed from father to son for four generations until it eventually left the "dragon killer" family's possession. The last Cadorna who wielded the blade was the infamous Porphyrys Cadorna , son of Eugenia Cadorna , the Cloth Merchant of Phlan.</p>
<p>After the man's disgrace and being run out of town, the sword remained with Porphyrys for about ten years, until the Year of the Crown, 1351 DR , when Porphyrys, still without an offspring, gifted the sword to his trusted bodyguard Skullcrusher . Skullcrusher kept the sword close through his adventuring career and brought it to his secluded cottage in the Neverwinter Wood after he retired. In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Skullcrusher was in his twilight years and often thought of what would happen to his possessions, namely magic weapons, after his inevitable death.</p>
