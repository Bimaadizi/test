<p>Felarathael ( pronounced : /ˈ f ɛ l ɛ ˈ r ɑː θ eɪ ɛ l / FEH-leh-RAH-thay-ehl was a solar in the service of Corellon and the twin spirit of Lashrael . Their might was so great that some elves , especially gold elves , considered them to be demipowers in their own right, but this was mistaken.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>They were the primary servitors of Corellon, most commonly acting as his messengers on Toril but also defending mortal elves under threat.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Felarathael and Lashrael were identical twins, with both appearing as tall, beautiful and androgynous elves of no particular race, with shining bodies and wearing gleaming white robes.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Despite being twins, the two had very different personalities. Felarathael was a being of pure rationality. Regardless of the situation, Felarathael considered things with calm detachment and logical reasoning. His speech, though slow and measured, was always with great reassurance. In battle, too, Felarathael was patient but skilled.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>In battle, rather than deal injury to a struck opponent, Felarathael and Lashrael could cause the victim to sleep without fail, suffer from amnesia, be polymorphed into the form of a forest animal , or be randomly teleported 1​ to ​10 miles (1.6​ to ​16 kilometers) away.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Lost Keep, 1379 DR , Felarathael and Lashrael went together to the Fugue Plane under the orders of Corellon Larethian to retrieve the soul of the slain drow Cavatina Xarann , a Darksong Knight of Eilistraee . They explained to her that a few hundreds of the followers of Eilistraee had been turned back back to their original dark elven form, and that Cavatina was among them, thanks to the sacrifice of Qilué Veladorn . Felarathael and Lashrael led her to Arvandor , as they claimed that the transformed drow would be allowed into the elven afterlife .</p>
