<p>Hannah was a commoner and mother of Giran from the City of Coin, Athkatla , the capital of Amn in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Giran and Hannah visited a circus performing at the center of Athkatla's Center District , in Waukeen's Promenade . Hannah went inside to watch a performance, while Giran waited for her outside. As the act started, a gnome walked on stage and started attempting to perform magic as it failed and fizzled. Hannah thought it to be a part of the show and laughed along with the crowed. But then the circus' tent fell victim to the mad gnome's illusionist magic. Bitter Kalah transformed the tent's interior into a fanciful tower. The tent's guests and performers became ensorcelled to appear as monsters. Hannah was trapped inside, transformed into a giant spider to her complete terror and despair. The child was left outside of the spellbound tent, crying for his missing mother. When the illusion was broken and the gnome defeated, Giran was reunited with Hannah.</p>
