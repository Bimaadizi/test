<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Korvan was actually a pretty good cook.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He and Shandril Shessair hated each other. Korvan had at some point become a contact for the Cult of the Dragon .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Korvan had been a cook at the Castle Obarskyr of Suzail . However, he got in trouble there by trying to charm some ladies with a magical philter; though the philter was not authentic, his seller was an informant for the War Wizards , and after a stern talking to, he was frightened into departing Suzail for other places. He continued to work jobs in Sembia for a while, until he arrived at the Rising Moon in Highmoon , where he remained in employment for a long time, under Gorstag , the tavern's owner.</p>
<p>Korvan habitually abused the owner's foster daughter, Shandril Shessair. After she fled the inn on 1357 DR, he learned from a malaugrym disguised as a herder, almost certainly Architrave , that she had been spotted wielding spellfire in the Thunder Peaks . He passed on this information to an agent.</p>
<p>When two months later Shandril returned to the inn, he briefly met with Narm Tamaraith , her husband. Then as they departed, he told a mage from the Cult of the Dragon, Thiszult , about her departure; he was caught on this by Lureene , and trying to fight his way out, was slain quickly by his boss, Gorstag, on Flamerule 9 .</p>
