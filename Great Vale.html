<p>The Great Vale , also known as Asanibis in the Mulhorandi language , was considered the breadbasket of the nation of Mulhorand . It included the lands that lie between the Dragonsword Mountains and the Menesankh .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The area that made up the Great Vale accounted for the majority of Mulhorand's farmland. The region was heavily irrigated, and the annual flooding of the River of Spears provided the soil with an infusion of sediment on a regular basis.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Attacks by monsters in this region increased over the course of 1358 DR , leading citizenry to demand that the land be cleared of such dangers.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The population of the Great Vale was composed primarily of humans . The majority of these individuals made their homes in the towns of Surbroar , Klondor , Ulzel , and Mishtan , though a fair number resided at the farms of the region. Rumors also indicated that intelligent storms known as Skriaxit may have once been found in the area around Klondor.</p>
