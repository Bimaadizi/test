<p>The Eyes of the Evening was a secretive sisterhood of werecats who served both Selûne , goddess of the moon , and Sharess , goddess of hedonism.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Eyes of the Evening were actively opposed to worshipers of Shar and Loviatar , and were known to hunt them during full moons. In their humanoid forms, members would disguise themselves as sex workers to gather intelligence or to go out on patrol.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , members of the Eyes of the Evening active in Waterdeep discovered a cult of Talona -worshiping wererats conspiring to spread a plague throughout the Dock Ward . Before the werecats could coordinate an attack on the cult, their findings were discovered by a priest at the House of the Moon who had secretly become a wererat. This priest revealed the identities and locations of the Eyes of Evening to the Talona worshipers, who hunted and killed the werecats one-by-one. The wererats then purportedly made plans to attack the House of the Moon itself.</p>
<p>In the years following this incident, the Eyes of the Evening became better known for their moonlit hunts of the followers of certain evil gods.</p>
