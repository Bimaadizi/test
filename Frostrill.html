<p>Frostrill was a small thorp located in the Druarwood , north of the Moonwood and the Cold Wood , in the Silver Marches .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The thorp's inhabitants were exclusively arctic dwarves and were led by Unimak Giantskull around 1372 DR . The dwarves strenuously defended their hunting territory from numerous enemies. Arctic dwarves tamed a small number of dire wolverines , which were used for hunting. They kept themselves as much as possible away from the giants in the area and they had no scruples about attacking orcs with incredible violence.</p>
