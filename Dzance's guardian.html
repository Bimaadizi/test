<p>Dzance's guardian was a magical shield of unknown origin, though it was believed to be dwarven in craft.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The shield enveloped its bearer in an aura that deflected magic missiles and absorbed magical electricity, such as that from shocking grasp . The latter effect would remain in the shield and, if its wielder so desired, could be discharged at nearby foes. When this occurred, there was about a one-in-three chance the shield and its wielder would be shifted into a random plane of existence .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The shield was discovered in the depths of Gauntlgrym by the ranger Dzance . Upon his retirement in Silverymoon , he bestowed it to a young knight named Belpir . Upon leaving for adventure, Belpir, and the shield, have not been seen since.</p>
