<p>Macaw was a species of a loud and brightly-colored parrot found in the jungles and hot humid forests in South Faerûn and on the continent of Maztica .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Macaws were renowned for their loud colors and the ability to memorize and imitate humanoid speech. Like other parrots, they had strong claws and beaks used for climbing and their toes allowed the birds to handle small objects.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>The macaw diet consisted of fruits, nuts, and a small quantity of meat.</p>
<p>In Maztica, locals often trained a number of exotic beasts. Parrots and macaws were among the most common. Their brightly colored feathers were used in the region's unique pluma magic. The more colorful the feather was, the more valuable it was to a pluma-user. Macaw plumage was gathered from birds caught by masterfully-crafted snares after the hunters quickly wrung their necks. These feathers were used by crafters to weave bright and brilliant macaw cloaks for Maztican nobles.</p>
<p>Pluma spells of bird charm II could be used to tame and command Maztican birds, including macaws.</p>
