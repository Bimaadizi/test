<p>Halbazzer Drin was an older wizard who served shopkeeper of the Sorcerous Sundries in the city of Baldur's Gate during the 14 th century DR . He sold many magical items, scrolls , wands and ammunition, but seldom had very rare objects in stock.</p>
<p>Years of experience as a shop owner and spellcaster had left Halbazzer quite wealthy. This was so true that his premises had garnered at least some observation and protection from the Grand Dukes themselves.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Having reached old age by the mid-14 th century Halbazzer was rather frail and stood stooped over. What hair he had left was stark white. He was known as rather gruff and could be moody at times.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>If anyone paid his price of 12 gp , Halbazzer would cast a spell for them that banished mildew from area or removed all the moisture from an item, without harming its structure. This was ideal in the city of Baldur's Gate as it's Lower City was so often covered in fog and mist. He never revealed the secret specifications of these spells despite repeated offerings of gold, jewels and magical secrets from as far away as Amn and Calimshan .</p>
<p>He was an expert at casting the spell mending and made even more of a name for himself as the premiere fixer of household objects in Baldur's Gate.</p>
