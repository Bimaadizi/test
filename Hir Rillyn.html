<p>Lord Hir Rillyn was a member of the noble patriar Rillyn family of Baldur's Gate , member of the Parliament of Peers , the Chair of The Committee of Concerned Patriars, and the father of Derque Rillyn in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Derque Rillyn unsuccessfully requested extra coin for his allowance after Hostel Mother Pammella Nortale , the proprietress of Nortale's Hostel pleaded for additional donations on top of the young nobleman's annual contributions. Hir denied the request as Derque had already overstepped the allowance, and the coin from the youth's incoming dowry was not there yet. Derque's cousin Clerebold had an idea how to get Hir to donate. He suggested that Nortale's Hostel, a non-profit hostel used to help refugees during the Absolute crisis , to be renamed to â€“ Hir Rillyn's Hostel, in order to convince daddy to donate a "good old chunk of change" and possibly even a bit of extra coin for Derque himself.</p>
<p>During the same period of time, the Cult of Bane identified Hir Rillyn as one of the eight top vulnerable Parliamentarians who would easily fall in line with the Absolute with some encouragement from bribery, blackmail, or direct threats.</p>
