<p>Clan Solar'el daggers were enchanted blades wielded by the assassins of the elvish Clan Solar'el in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Clan Solar'el daggers possessed a quality +2 enchantment to their damage and the same enchantment guided the wielder's hand towards the targets. The same magic also allowed the dagger to harm creatures otherwise unaffected by mundane weapons. Each slash with such dagger dealt additional radiant damage and, when wielded against fiends , its magics effectively became a devastating +8 enchantment.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The elvish Clan Solar'el was known as virtuois defenders of all that is good, who helmed a war against fiends and their allies. It was believed that some of the Clan Solar'el daggers once pierced the demon Belaphoss . In the ;ate 15 th centur DR, a gang of Clan Solar'el assassins attacked the Champion of the Burning Dawn and their allies, mistakingly believing them to be thralls of Belaphoss. The assassins were defeated, leaving behind a damaged Clan Solar'el dagger that may had eventually been reforged by a master from Luskan , using shards of the similar weapons found in the lair of Rhylfang .</p>
