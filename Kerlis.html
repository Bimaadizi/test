<p>Kerlis was one of the Blades of the Old Man in the fortress of Sentinelspire . He was a part of the team accompanying Sauk to look for Kheil and secure the Erael'len in the Northern Shalhoond , conspiring to kill the Old Man of the Mountain . He appeared to be afraid of spiders. Kerlis was instrumental to Lewan 's capture, in order to assure Berun's compliance, but he received a number of painful wounds in the process, which affected his already low standing amongst his peers. Kerlis and Dren stayed behind to watch Berun and Lewan when Sauk decided to hunt down some yaqubi , expecting them to be carrying gold. Berun disabled them and fled, though Sauk's party caught up to them by the next morning. He was slain by Berun with an arrow to the eye then, on Tarsakh 16 .</p>
