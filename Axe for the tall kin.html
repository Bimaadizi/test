<p>Axes for the tall kin were a variety of enchanted double axes created on the Sword Coast North in the late 14 th century DR , but their design was traced back to the land of Rashemen .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>There existed three variants of the axes for the tall kin weapon, each possessed a +1 , +3 , and +8 enchantments what made the axe's blade deadlier and guided the wielder's hand towards the target. All three versions glowed with a gentle white radiance, illuminating 10 feet (3 meters) around. However, the strongest version from Rashemen increased the radius to 15 feet (4.6 meters), dealt fire damage to the targets, and possessed keen edges.</p>
<p>An axe for the tall kin could be created from an enchanted double axe and a slab of adamantite .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to the Rashemaar legends, the axe for the tall kin was once wielded by a legendary giant king called Kirsk . Its blades were powerful enough to effortlessly split a mountain into pebbles. The story then claimed that the axe was lost after Kirsk split a mountain that bordered a sea that spilled over and drowned all the giants. This legend was one of the reasons why many civilized lands considered Rashemaar quite strange.</p>
<p>More prosaic versions of axes for the tall kin with a simpler +1 enchantment were forged by Master Blacksmith Marrok of Shining Knight Arms and Armor shop of Neverwinter to help the heroes who sought the cure from the dreaded Wailing Death of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Later the same year, more powerful versions were created by Master Blacksmith Barun of Beorunna's Well to help the forces of Neverwinter stand against Lady Aribeth the Betrayer , who led a marching army of Luskan in the deadly but short-lived Neverwinter-Luskan war.</p>
