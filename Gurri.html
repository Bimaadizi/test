<p>Gurri , also known as Guran , was the creole language spoken by the nomadic Gur people of the Western Heartlands .</p>
<h2>Script</h2>
<p>In later times, Gurri made use of the Thorass alphabet .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Although considered a patois or creole tongue of the Imaskari languages group, scholars observed the influence of countless other languages, many of them dead by the 14th century DR . In particular, the dead Halardrim language of the Rashemi had a strong influence; the Gurs were generally believed to be of Rashemi descent. Among the Imaskari languages, it was most closely related to the Eastern group .</p>
<h2>Names</h2>
<p>Similar to Rashemi names, common Western Heartlands Gur names included Boriv, Gardar, Madevik, and Vlad for men; Varra, Ulmarra, Imza, Navarra, and Yuldra for women; and Chergoba, Drazlad, Tazyara, Vargoba, and Stayankina as surnames.</p>
