<p>Abysm , also referred to as the Schismed , was a vestige borne out of Jhaamdath 's destruction. When countless drowned beneath the tidal wave sent by the elves of neighboring Nikerymath , their minds melded together to become Abysm, transforming into the mad remnants of a psionic mythal .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When called forth by a binder , Abysm initially showed itself as a growth of crystals. These then expanded into a kaleidoscopic tree that would, without warning, break apart into a cyclone of resplendent dust wherein its nebulous face took shape. In this particular form, the Schismed spoke in a discordant tone.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Abysm had long succumbed to insanity , its madness so terrible that merely attempting to reach out to the vestige was known to drive binders to the brink of lunacy in seconds. However, sometime soon before the late 14 th century DR , the Schismed regained a measure of its senses—at least, according to some reports. This made it possible for it to bind to a host without danger to the mortal's mind.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The Schismed maintained a measure of its original psionic abilities, able to use these skills to draw people into its territory and teleport them back out across the whole of Faerûn . Given its vestigial nature, however, Abysm was also capable of bonding with a user of pact magic and so share its talents in the Invisible Art with its host. These were originally abilities employed by the Jhaamdathi before they became the Schismed.</p>
<p>Through such pacts, Abysm bolstered its binder's reserve of mind magic, a cumulative effect that made psions out of those individuals without wild talents or strengthened those who already had such capabilities. The vestige similarly lent access to certain psionic devotions, though it was limited in this regard. Abysm was only known to impart the use of animal affinity , astral construct , clairvoyant sense , energy missile , psionic levitate , and read thoughts . Nevertheless, its binders could employ such powers as if they were a true, experienced psionicist.</p>
<h2>Divine Realm</h2>
<p>Though not a divine realm in the common sense, the Schismed made its home in the Palace of Naarkolyth , a floating, extraplanar city. It shared this space with Bpdethrys —a caller in darkness created by the same disaster that led to Abysm's birth—as well as twelve scions of Jhaamdath's most important families. The place was suffused with chaotic energies, and even the powerful, surviving Jhaamdathi could not overcome the psionic blocks placed upon Naarkolyth by both the Schismed and Bpdethrys.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Like most vestiges, the tether between Abysm and its latest host manifested through a series of physiological oddities. Namely, its binder began to exude gem dust in place of sweat, akin to maenads , and both their toenails and fingernails turned to crystal. The Schismed further influenced their host's speech, rendering their words fragmented—as if multiple voices were attempting to talk through them.</p>
<p>Their binder's mannerisms, shifting unpredictably, were similarly affected. One moment, they were self-assured, and the next, they were instead docile; they had fits of submissiveness and of pomposity, or even changed between a feminine and masculine air. Though no unique stipulations had to be met to summon Abysm, it did demand, once hosted, that its host refrain from using a psicrystal .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Some believed that Abysm's origins were tied to Myth Drannor , the legendary elven city. Though it was known that a group of odd psionicists once visited the City of Song, spending much of their time studying and inquiring about mythals , the rest was merely conjecture. Sages of vestigial matters believed that these psionicists returned to their fellows, established their own mythal—one psionically powered rather than magically so—and that it was from this instrument, known as Abysm, that the Schismed later derived its name.</p>
<p>This psionic field weaved together every citizen of this supposedly secret city through their psicrystals. Certain theories then suggested that such a direct link, upon their sudden annihilation, ensnared their very souls in its web of psionic energy, fusing them together until their psicrystals were unable to contain so much power. Every single device broke apart in unison, leaving behind only Abysm, the Schismed.</p>
