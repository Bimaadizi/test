<h2>History</h2>
<p>After Araman led a coup against Nefris , the headmistress of the Academy of Shapers and Binders , he sent his loyal mage Khai Khmun to kill Lienna and Safiya . Khai managed to kill Lienna in Aglarond but crossed paths with the Kalach-Cha , who became forcibly involved in the matter. Thus, when Khai tried to kill Safiya, she allied with the Kalach-Cha in search of answers and the two killed Khai Khmun.</p>
