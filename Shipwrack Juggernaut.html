<h2>History</h2>
<p>On Highharvestide in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , along the River Sargauth in the Underdark , various shipwrecks assembled into a seemingly unstoppable creature. It swam up the river then went into a gate that took it out of Undermountain 's Sargauth Level .</p>
<p>By highsun , the Shipwrack Juggernaut had appeared in the Nelanther Isles in the Sea of Swords , then attacked the port of Skaug and terrorized the pirates there. It focused its attention on the Sea Reavers , a pirate crew returning from looting Amnian ships that were returning to Murann after a successful trade mission to Zakhara . It sank two of their three ships.</p>
<p>By dusk, the Shipwrack Juggernaut had collapsed into wreckage. This was later scavenged by the inhabitants of the port for building materials and for whatever treasure could be found in it.</p>
