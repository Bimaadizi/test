<p>Brenjer was a merchant that dealt in arms, often sending guarded caravans through the Shadow Gap to Daggerdale circa 1350 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1350 DR, the ambitious and ruthless mercantile organization Iron Throne attempted to monopolize the weapon trade by closing the Shadow Gap off for the traders, restricting the trade route. For that purpose, they paid an evil wizard Cassana to use one of her terrifying extraplanar creatures—the kalmari .</p>
<p>Before taking over the pass, the kalmari murdered Brenjer, and later killed the barbarian hired to escort his trade caravan.</p>
