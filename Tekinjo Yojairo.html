<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Yojairo was a man of good heart and a very efficient administrator. Even though he was part of a family that essentially guaranteed him an official position, he could easily have earned the role by the merits of his shrewd skill in management.</p>
<p>His service had shown him the true miseries of Wa's poor people and the hypocrisies of the shogunate , and he began to grow discontent with his rule in the government of Wa. He kept these feelings secret from everyone.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>

<p>When Yojairo learned that shogun Matasuuri Nagahide 's granddaughter Kisha Yunoko was sent to be the emperor's concubine as a means of spying on him, he was disgusted. Knowing that she was forced to act as a pawn, he felt great compassion for her, which soon grew into love, and they began a secret affair.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
