<p>In 1375 DR , the thief Gage broke into the Shadow Tongue lair looking for the enchanted elven sword Angul , which the Shadow Tongue had stolen.Gage says Sathra was after Angul. He found a way into the vault through sheer luck, after Sathra left the door open while leaving. She had been injured by trying to touch the blade herself. She caught the thief not long after, but wielding the blade, he managed to slay many of her bodyguards and even a summoned demon before she retreted.</p>
