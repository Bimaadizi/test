<p>Wurt Dumire was a tyrant ruling the goblin realm of the Kingdom of Nix in the Utter East during the time of the Bloodforge Wars ( 648 â€“ 657 DR ).</p>
<p>In the aftermath of Redfang the Reaper 's reign, Wurt Dumire came to enslave the goblins of Nix, putting them to work in a far-off mine. The leader of the Legendary Campaign felt unexpected sympathy for the goblins' plight and was compelled to try to bring an end to Wurt's operation in a bloodforge battle in Nix itself.</p>
