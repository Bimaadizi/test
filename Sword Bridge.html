<p>Sword Bridge was a bridge that connected Luskan 's Closeguard Island and Cutlass Island in the River Mirar . Only members of the Arcane Brotherhood or of Ship Kurth were permitted to cross.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>It was a short, arching bridge that afforded a view of Closeguard Island and Kurth Tower as its midpoint was crossed from Cutlass Island.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , the Arcane Brotherhood had placed a secret ward on Sword Bridge that allowed them to summon battle horrors to protect access to Cutlass Island. The Archmage Arcane Arklem Greeth had further strengthened its magical defenses around this time.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When forces led by Deudermont and Lord Brambleberry attacked Luskan to drive out Arklem Greeth and the Arcane Brotherhood in the Year of the Bent Blade, 1376 DR , a major turning point occurred when High Captain Kurth permitted their forces to cross the Dark Arch and Sword Bridge to attack Cutlass Island and the Host Tower of the Arcane by land. Sword Bridge was defended at this time by the Brotherhood's wizards , who were insufficient to stop the attackers.</p>
<p>When efforts to rebuild the Host Tower began in the late 15 th century DR, Beniago Kurth 's control over the bridge (and thus access to Cutlass Island) allowed him to persuade the newcomers into an alliance with his Ship circa 1484 DR .</p>
<p>When House Margaster invaded Luskan in the Year of Dwarvenkind Reborn, 1488 DR , Sword Bridge was briefly occupied by gnolls .</p>
