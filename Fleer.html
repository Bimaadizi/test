<p>Fleer was a fisherwoman from the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Fleer was a human woman with a bronze skin tone, light brown hair and eyes. She wore a blue commoner's tunic and a workman's trousers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , as the Absolute crisis ravaged the Gate, Fleer's fishing was damaged further by pollution of the Gray Harbor . Fishers in the Lower City kept pulling up nets filled with fish covered in black oily goo. In reality, the fish was smothered in oil pollution left behind by a submersible used by the Cult of Bane to transport Lord Gortash 's prisoners into the drowned Iron Throne headquarters prison at the bottom of Gray Harbor.</p>
