<p>Deepearth was a city and the surroundings areas in the Underdark under the Galena Mountains in the Bloodstone Lands .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Deepearth was originally settled by deep gnomes . In the surrounding caverns lived some clans of duergar . The duergar occasionally skirmished with the gnomes in order to gain food, cattle, and sometimes slaves, but with few successes. At last, a great deep gnome army devastated the duergar territories, stopping the raids.</p>
<p>However, one night, a solitary duergar infiltrated Deepearth and inside an abandoned gnome mine discovered a pool of mercury (in truth, a gate to the Abyss ). He touched the liquid and was quickly possessed by the demon lord Orcus . With Orcus as their leader, the duergar managed to seize Deepearth.</p>
<p>In 1357 DR , however, Gareth Dragonsbane 's party arrived in Deepearth and fought the duergar and the minions of Orcus.</p>
<p>In 1359 DR , the gnomes had regained control of the city and worked with the dwarves of the Orothiar Clan in order to exploit Bloodstone Mines .</p>
