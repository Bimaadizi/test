<p>Ormu was a common glowing fungus that grew in the Underdark .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ormu favored warm, moist areas such as steam tunnels and steam vents and grew in mossy patches typically around 18 square feet (1.7 square meters) in size, but could grow up to 48 square feet (4.5 square meters). It gave off a soft green glow that provided dim illumination in a 5‑foot (1.5‑meter) radius.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Ormu had a powdery surface and drow women sometimes used this powder as eye shadow (typical price, 5 cp per pouch ). If harvested and dried, it yielded a phosphorescent powder that could be used to create a glowing pigment. This pigment was used in dyes for all types of cloth. It could be made into a paint by mixing it with glowworm juice and was used to make signs and flags that even surface-dwellers could see in the dark (typical price, 6 sp per jar). With special preparation, it could be made into an ink for inscribing scrolls and spellbooks (typical price, 25 gp per 1 oz (28 g).</p>
