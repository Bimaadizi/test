<p>Needle blights were medium-sized blights spawned from a Gulthias tree .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Needle blights looked enough like a hunched humanoid to be mistaken for one in the shadows of a forest, but a closer look made their plant-like nature obvious. Conifer-like needles grew in clumps across their bodies, and their gait was best described as shuffling.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Needle blights, like the rest of their foul kin, were evil-hearted, malevolent creatures.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Needle blights possessed blindsight only, and could understand Common but did not speak- as plants, they lacked eyes and a mouth. They were, however, capable of flinging the needles from their bodies as short-ranged projectiles.</p>
<p>When a needle blight detected a potential threat, it released a particular pollen into the air. This pollen carried to and was detected by other needle blights who, alerted to the location of the threat, would swarm in from all sides.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Needle blights attacked with their clawed hands and the needles that grew on them.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Like most other blights, needle blights were found in forests.</p>
<p>Needle blights were known to inhabit the Quivering Forest as of the 15 th century DR .</p>
