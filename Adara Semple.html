<p>Adara Semple was a Morninglord of Amaunator that visited the Wheloon Prison in Cormyr in the late 15 th century DR during the Shadovar invasion of Wheloon .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Adara was a light-skinned human woman who wore her blonde hair tied back. In the field, she wore a suit of chain mail , and carried a buckler and mace -like holy symbol of Amaunator.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Adara was an extremely upbeat and cheerful woman, and sought only to help and uplift others (such as by smiting evil ).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Like many other priests of Amaunator including Dai Rolno and Maribe Banro , Adara was deeply concerned by the conditions inside Wheloon . She managed to gain entrance into the city (possibly with the aid of her comrade Karie Leddle ) and found her way to Harvest Hall , where the Wheloon natives managed and protected their own part of the prison. From there, Adara sought assistance in investigating Shar Manor , a stronghold of the Shadovar that she believed held a great threat. On reaching the Manor, she found a ritual being cast by a Sharran priest to extend the Shadowfell 's local influence further via the Shadowfell Nexus , and slew the ritualist, thwarting one small part of the Netherese plans.</p>
