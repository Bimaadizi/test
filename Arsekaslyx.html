<p>Arsekaslyx was a red dragon member of the Cult of the Dragon . She was called to the Well of Dragons to reinforce the defense of the Cult's stronghold there.</p>
<h2>Relationship</h2>
<p>Arsekaslyx enjoyed playing with the Cult's commanders in the Well; she kept her presence secret from Naergoth Bladelord to avoid a confrontation for power. On the other hand, she tempted Vargo Kent with the secret of becoming a half-dragon dracolich .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In order to retain her sanity during the Rage of Dragons of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , she used an artifact called the bone scepter of Zceryll , known as the "the star-spawn", which protected her from the Rage's effects but also warped her physiology.</p>
<p>She arrived at the Well of Dragons in around 1373 DR and remained there until at least the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR .</p>
