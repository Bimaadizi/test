<p>Baergon Bluesword was a cleric of Tempus in Daggerford around 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Baergon went to Daggerford with the City Guard of Waterdeep to fight against the evil of Dragonspear Castle . Finding many fighters, he established a shrine to the God of Battles. Baergon had many devotees among the Waterdhavian soldiers, some militiamen, and adventurers but only in 1370 DR did the common folk of Daggerford start to accept him and still many farmers feared that Baergon would send their sons to fight in some far place. Baergon had explained many times that he never sent people to battle without going himself but this failed to change their minds.</p>
<p>He lived in a small house in west Daggerford located along Wall Street near the Caravan Gate .</p>
