<p>Suckertails were a variety of eel found in Tarmalune , one of the Windrise Ports of Laerakond .</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Suckertails had soft sucking mouths, and only ate dung and rotting things. They also ate blood, but not from living beings, only sucking blood from carrion.</p>
<p>People from Tarmalune allowed, and even encouraged, the existence of a large population of wild suckertails in the sewers of Tarmalune, as the suckertails ate all the garbage produced in the city, helping to maintain the city tidy and clean.</p>
<p>Some people even domesticated suckertails to use during their bathing sessions, as short exposure to swarms of suckertails was said to be pleasant.</p>
