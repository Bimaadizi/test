<h2>Description</h2>

After an effigy of Entar Silvershield was placed above the gate, it became traditional to honor prominent Baldurians past and present in this manner. This practice continued until the lateâ€“15 th century DR .</p>
<p>Within the gate were offices of the Flaming Fist , along with a few single-occupant prison cells.</p>
