<p>The Balance , also known as the Cosmic Balance or Great Balance , was a philosophical concept that decreed it was a multiversal necessity for the abstract forces of good and evil and/or law and chaos to be balanced and that no extreme of either should gain an upper hand over the other(s), under the notion that none of them could exist without their counterpart. It was, for some, one of the principles behind what was known as true neutrality . Different conceptions of the Balance disagreed on whether it was a fundamental requirement of being, and thus that for reality to exist things could be no other way, or if it could hypothetically be replaced were circumstances to change.</p>
<h2>Notable Adherents</h2>
<p>Very few mortals or entities fully embraced the Balance, since it required a grasp of events on a cosmic level and those who vowed to maintain it often made enemies. However, some embraced the Balance simply to further their own personal quests for power. Some of those in the multiverse who both believed in and adhered to the concept of the Balance included the following.</p>

<h2>Disrupting the Balance</h2>
<p>Within Toril's crystal sphere, there were a number of ways deities could be found guilty of disrupting the Balance. Notable among these were by impersonating other deities, and infringing upon their duties by acting outside their own divine purview.</p>
<p>Disruptions in the Balance could alter worlds on the Prime Material plane . When the goddess Mystra died on planet Toril during the Time of Troubles , the very "fabric of reality" surrounding her was worn thin. The Landscape around the site of her death became transmutable, and the various deities of the Faerûnian pantheon each took turns modifying it to reflect their divine nature.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Faerûnian goddess Mystra was formally tried for disrupting the Balance by her fellow gods in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR . She was granted clemency by reason of her previous existence as a mortal of Toril.</p>
