<h2>History</h2>
<p>As a Red Wizard of Thay, he studied the arcane art of illusion but later moved west to the Sword Coast North , where he joined the Arcane Brotherhood. They accepted him with open arms, being eager to gain a Red Wizard among their ranks. Dzaan could have been a great asset to the Brotherhood. However, he went north to Icewind Dale where he was seemingly burned to death by the people of Easthaven after slaughtering an adventuring party. Despite his apparent death, Dzaan had cast the mighty simulacrum spell, and had kept a copy of himself at a lost Netherese spire within the Dale. This construct stayed with Dzaan's previous bodyguard, Krintaas, a wight that has accompanied him from Thay.</p>
