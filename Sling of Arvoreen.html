<p>Slings of Arvoreen were magic slings , thought to be created through a blessing from the hin deity Arvoreen .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These slings were enchanted to deal truly mighty blows to their targets. They functioned as weapons possessing a powerful +4 enchantment and granted the wielders magical freedom of movement .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The very first of these Arvoreenan weapons were believed to be gifted to the halfling hero Tuckerby Letterworp after he emerged victorious from the Battle of Moor Road . However, that story was contradicted because similar items appeared in virtually all halfling settlements across the Realms. Like the famed Story of Littleman , the story behind slings of Arvoreen remained unconfirmed and obscured by boisterous embellishments.</p>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR , a number of such magic slings existed, found along the Sword Coast , in the city of Neverwinter , as well as the city of Melvaunt in the Moonsea region.</p>
