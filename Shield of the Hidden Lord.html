<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Shield of the Hidden Lord was forged from pure mithral and was inlaid with scores of tiny gems . The many rubies , emeralds , sapphires and diamonds arranged into the obverse of the shield formed the face of a snarling beast.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This +4 large shield granted its wielder a number of powers. Firstly, they were protected from projectile weapons as if they were under the effects of the spell protection from arrows . Second, they could understand any language as if they were affected by the spell tongues .</p>
<p>When the shield was borne however, the Hidden Lord Gargauth could speak through the mouth of demonic face that was formed by the shield's decorative gems and hear any words spoken within hearing distance. Gargauth could even communicate directly with the bearer of the shield, compelling them to commit cruel and treacherous deeds every day.</p>
