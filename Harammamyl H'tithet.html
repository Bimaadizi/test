<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Harammamyl hid well her disgust for other races and even understood that a little false compassion helped in business.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Harammamyl was a member of the merchant House H'tithet . In 1372 DR , she became a delegate to Mantol-Derith after assassinating her predecessor, Yyssisiryl H'tithet . However, the Siege of Menzoberranzan prevented travel to her home city and for the time, Harammamyl, like Kassawar Plickenstint , had very little to do.</p>
