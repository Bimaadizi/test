<p>A sentinel's cudgel was a special type of enchanted club or mace crafted by the druids of the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>There were several sentinel's cudgels in existence. They were stout, oak clubs that each had a unique shape and features as determined by the manner in which the individual tree from which it was crafted had died.</p>
<h3>Creation</h3>
<p>To create a sentinel's cudgel , a druid of the Earthmother harvested the wood from a dead oak that had lived for at least a century. The wood was then shaped using a blessed blade and immersed in the waters of a moonwell for at least a full day. The method of crafting a sentinel's cudgel was very similar to the method for crafting a druid's cudgel .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These cudgels were capable of landing powerful blows, but were particularly dangerous in the hands of someone who fought alongside beasts or summoned creatures . Once each day, it had the power to galvanize allied beasts and summons to attack a foe struck by the cudgel, as well as to strike quickly against foes those allies attacked first.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The sentinel's cudgels were crafted prior to the coming of Kazgaroth in the Year of the Saddle, 1345 DR , but following this event, any attempts to create new ones produced weaker weapons, likely due to the Earthmother withdrawing much of her power from the moonwells.</p>
<p>However, as of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , some claimed that Antola Pilark —the last Great Druid of Alaron —had at last succeeded in crafting a true sentinel's cudgel .</p>
