<p>Alchemical sleep gas was a substance used to render someone unconscious.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The gas was stored in liquid form in sealed containers, but it was extremely volatile and would form a gas at room temperature when released from its container. Alchemists of the Realms often sold the substance in sealed glass flasks that could be used like grenade weapons. These flasks weighed roughly 1.25 pounds (0.567 kilograms).</p>
<p>Only mages highly trained in the skill of alchemy could synthesize sleep gas. Flasks of the stuff sold in most markets for about 30 gold pieces a piece.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>At high concentrations, the gas was slightly toxic and would put living creatures to sleep, usually for about only one minute but perhaps as long as five minutes. The toxin could even knock unconscious such creatures like elves who were immune to magical sleeping spells, but it did not work as well or at all on creatures that were resistant or immune to poisons, respectively. The cloud of gas formed from a typical flask was only potent over an area of about 5 feet (1.5 meters) square and quickly dissipated.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The thief Gage from Laothkund carried a dose of alchemical sleep gas in a bottle labeled Inhalant as of 1375 DR .</p>
