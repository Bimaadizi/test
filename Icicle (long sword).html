<p>Icicle was a unique long sword forged by the song-smith named Gehorg Diamondforge of Ravens Bluff in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Icicle got its name from the sword 's blade, which had turned transparent during forging.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Apart from its impressive appearance, Icicle possessed a +2 enchantment to the wielder's aim and the blade's damage. It was also especially deadly to creatures that were not scared of any sort of cold. When wielded against such creatures of cold, the weapon's blade became effectively a devastating +5 enchanted weapon. Additionally, Icicle acted in the same fashion as a ring of warmth did and allowed the wielder to unleash the cone of cold spell once per day.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Gehorg Diamondforge and many other stores of Ravens Bluff's Market District fell victim to extortion by a group of criminals. These people— Marella , Elizza , Moamar , and Rundell —were members of the warlord Myrkyssa Jelan 's army that waged war on the Vast just a year prior. Gehorg spent years of his life creating weapons of great power through the ancient dwarven art of song-smithing. The master smith lost several magic weapons to the extortionists: Icicle , Stone Splitter , Flame Quencher , and Starshine . This loss disillusioned Gehorg Diamondforge, and he decided to leave Ravens Bluff and its corruption unless the city was to reimburse him for the masterworks lost to the people whom he perceived to be Living City watchmen.</p>
