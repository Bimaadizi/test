<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Zeal's Walk was believed to be crafted by the Newt's Brood coven. The witches enchanted the chainmail to keep an eye on their lover, Tholan the Beautiful , a ranger who often traveled far and wide out of the witches' grasp. The stories said that when the ranger met and married a beautiful elven maid, he hid the enchanted armor in attempts to avoid the ex-lovers' scorn.</p>
<p>Sometime before 1372 DR , the armor came into the possessions of a kobold hero Muurg , even though his adventuring career and life were cut short. By 1372 DR, the Zeal's Walk was buried and hidden under an unassuming moss -covered rock in the desolate plot of craggy land known as the Lonely Barrens .</p>
