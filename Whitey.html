<p>Whitey was a promising young assassin of the Night Masks in 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Whitey was born in the Shore area of Westgate in the Year of the Morningstar, 1350 DR . His father was unknown and his mother was a festhall worker who died giving birth to him. He eked out a living as a street urchin until Tyaa Tymmyr saw him kill a bigger boy in a knife fight and decided to train Whitey as an assassin. The privations of his previous life made Whitey appear to be a pale, emaciated, twelve-year-old boy, a characteristic he made good use of in his work. After more than a dozen successful assassinations, Dahlia Vhammos herself took an interest in him.</p>
