<p>The beautiful coastal city of Umara , or the " City of Knights ," lay at the mouth of Al-Yatir River , about a hundred and seventy miles northeast of Liham . Its appearance was marked by its distinctive blue tilework and textiles. In 1367 DR the outwardly peaceful situation was still stabilizing after a bloody palace coup by barbarian troops enlisted for a campaign against Muluk by the old caliph .</p>
