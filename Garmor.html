<p>Garmor was a novice duergar member of the Cult of the Absolute during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Garmor had gray skin and long white dreadlocks that framed his bearded face adorned with white barbarian pain. He did not wear armor and charged into battle bare-chested, wielding a greataxe .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Garmor accompanied slaver Gekh Coal and his duergar med to a decrepit coastal village in the Underdark that once was a deep gnome colony. On the behest of the Absolute, duergar held the ruined village to be used as a skiff port to transport goods and slaves to the Grymforge . With the events of the Absolute crisis unfolding, Garmor and his fellow duergar could have faced several fates; they could've been confronted by and slain by the Absolute Adversaries as they sought passage to the Grymforge or as a favor to an aspiring myconid sovereign Glut .</p>
