<p>Vintner's Keep was the name given to the ruins of the keep, rumored to be the winery that once produced the legendary Jasmarim Shadow wine.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Vintner's Keep stood to the south of Lurkwood , right between Luskan and Mithral Hall .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The air inside the ruins was dry and cool thanks to the enchantments placed on the cellar in the days when the winery was active.</p>
<p>The entryway was a large square room that housed empty long dried wine caskets. Past the entrance room laid a long corridor that eventually went around, connecting the entire structure, and another corridor branched off it in the middle and led to the east. A large rhombus room was beyond the eastern corridor that housed five skeletons , rubble, and broken furniture. The northern part of the rhombus room led to a big area that was used as the main production room with a huge wine-pressing vat in its northern corner and a secret wall compartment. The wine-pressing room was connected to a square room at the end of the main hall.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In late 15 th century DR, Jasmarim Shadow was a rare and precious find. The wines of the Vintner's Keep have been out of production for centuries by that time. The winery belonged to a moon elf whose name was lost to the ages and who excelled at his craft. His wine was made in limited quantities and small batches and was reserved for the most exclusive galas and events.</p>
<p>A cook from Luskan who worked out of the Cutlass , circa 1490 DR was searching for a bottle of the legendary wine to hone his skills. He hired the Champion of the Burning Dawn and their companion to retrieve some of the Jasmarim Shadow from the Vintner's Keep.</p>
<p>When Champion of the Burning Dawn arrived at the ruins of the keep, the ancient winery was claimed by a lich as his lair. He filled the rooms of the keep with his skeletal minions and took the wine production room as his laboratory. After a fierce battle, the undead was destroyed and the Champion of the Burning Dawn managed to retrieve an entire casket of rare wine.</p>
