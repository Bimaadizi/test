<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Slings of force possessed a potent +3 enchantment and magically boosted the wielder's physical strength and allowed the wilder to use their strength to increase the damage output of each bullet sent towards the targets.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Slings of force were crafted by a diminutive tinkered and an aspiring adventurer named Gendlesen Barstow sometime before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Gendlesen thought that in order to adventure, she needed to be stronger. To achieve that, she started making these weapons in many variations and designs. Most of the slings of force ended up stoled off of Gendlesen's workbench and ended up in the hands of many people across Faerûn . By the late 14 th century DR, some of these slings found their way to the city of Neverwinter as well as the merchants of the Crossroad Keep in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR .</p>
