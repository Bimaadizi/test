<p>Belathra Kyndle was an innkeeper and a priestess of Sune in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . She lived in Sleeping Hollow on the Arnrock , and was the sole human on the island.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>She was the proprietor of the Brazen Buck , both the island's only inn and its only tavern. Her establishment was also the only place where other non- halflings could have a drink.</p>
<p>Perhaps cognizant of the fact that she lived on a volcano, Belathra maintained a cog on the eastern coast of the island that was always fully stocked and ready to sail. If needed, she could fit the island's entire halfling population onto the ship with her.</p>
