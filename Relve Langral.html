<h2>History</h2>
<p>Relve Langral was a thief among the Nine. After the Crown of Horns corrupted them, only one thief in the band survived until 1358 DR : Arnthiir Windriiv , all but stating that Relve Langral had died prior to that moment in time.</p>
<p>While a blueflame ghost, Relve Langral claimed to have been a thief among the Nine, reduced to madness before death by the evil Myrkul and then transformed into a blueflame ghost upon it. He had been called forth at some point prior to 1479 DR. This calling could only have happened prior to 1437 DR as well, as the item containing him, the Flying Blade , had been largely unreachable for anyone but Marlin Stormserpent at least that long.</p>
<p>After testing the command to return to the item in the Dragonskull Chamber at Obarskyr Castle , Marlin commanded him and fellow blueflame ghost Treth Halonter go find and kill Seszgar Huntcrown in Suzail . In executing the command, the two went on a rampage. Every time they met someone on the streets, Relve asked if they'd seen Seszgar Huntcrown, with Treth adding immediately if they'd seen him recently. The duo killed anyone who didn't know where he was. Their rampage ended when they came across Belgryn Murenstur ; they intimidated the man into leading them to the Bold Archer . Once there, Relve had Belgryn scout as to the presence of Seszgar; the man confirmed that he remained inside, as well as volunteering the number of bodyguards, and the many other nobles and retinues present inside. The blueflame ghosts walked inside, and killed many people inside, including Seszgar.</p>
<p>After slaying the Huntcrown heir, the two took his corpse to Marlin Stormserpent at Stormserpent Towers ; he called on them to throw it in the furnace. They were called on afterwards to kill Jharakphred , an artist for hire, after the later painted for Marlin the likenesses of Draskos Crownsilver and Gariskar Dauntinghorn , who were to be the ghosts' next target. Later, a frightened Marlin used the ghosts to watch over him in his sleep.</p>
<p>On the evening after the disastrous Council of the Dragon , Treth Halonter and Relve Langral were sent into the palace as part of another plan, this time hatched by Marlin Stormserpent and Traevyn Illance both, in which Marlin would make himself out to be the one who stopped those ghosts. Along the way, however, they were spotted by one of the Lords of Waterdeep , Mirt , by the understeward Corleth Fentable , by the evil archmage vampire Manshoon , who was riding on Corleth Fentable's mind at the moment, and finally by the renegade wizard Elminster Aumar . The ghosts were attacked before reaching the palace.</p>
<p>Relve Langral was almost destroyed by one of Elminster's spells, and fled, returning to Marlin Stormserpent, who allowed the two ghosts to rest, on Halonter's advice; the ghost was quite distressed about the injuries they'd received. His next use of the ghosts was to try and capture him some breakfast in the wilderness after he fled Suzail; unfortunately for him, the only creature they were able to kill was a bear , as everything else fled the unnatural entities.</p>
<p>The Flying Blade was seized by Cymmarra after she slew Marlin Stormserpent; she was building her own collection of those ghosts, which she mobilized towards the Bold Blazon at the Festival of Handras . She later pursued Elminster into a secret cave after he retrieved the belt buckle of Lord Calantar (Lord) , secretly a blueflame item , wielding her retinue of ghosts against him there. She stopped using the blueflame items after The Simbul , restored by the belt buckle, slew her.</p>
