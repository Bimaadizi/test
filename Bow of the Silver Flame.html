<p>The bow of the Silver Flame was a holy longbow found in Eberron during the mid-1480s DR of Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The bow was made of a dark, near-black wood.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The bow was filled with holy and good energy, making it exceptional at smiting evil . It was even more deadly against the undead , and each arrow was magically enhanced as if they were made of silver , letting them better harm lycanthropes and vampires , and further altered so that they struck with crushing rather than piercing force, shattering skeletons easily.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The bow was created for the Templars of the Silver Flame , who sought a more powerful weapon for smiting the undead. The bow was later given to adventurers in Stormreach who had helped the paladin Felnis investigate the Lords of Dust when they opened a passage to Khyber and the Spinner's Prison , ultimately leading them to Faerûn.</p>
