<h2>History</h2>
<p>On orders from Ganrahast Aeiulvana to slay Elminster and retrieve a part that could be used to identify the body, Andram Rendarth was part of an ambush set for Elminster Aumar , a fugitive wizard , in 1479Â DR , when the latter snuck into Castle Obarskyr in Suzail again, after stealing the Royal Gorget of Battle earlier in the year. During that ambush, Andram Rendarth used a deadly spell, bolstered by consuming and unweaving wards in the castle, against Elminster and his companion, Storm Silverhand . That was extremely painful, but did not kill them. He later sent one of his underlings, Rorskryn Mreldrake , who had already faced Elminster earlier during the raid at Tethgard , to check if the man remained in one piece. Elminster quickly countered with an enchanted wand of paralysis , which froze two war wizards, missing Rorskryn; Elminster voiced his extreme displeasure that Andram Rendarth had unwound the wards, and the fact that Ganrahast had obviously signed off on that.</p>
<p>A watching Manshoon shared Elminster's displeasure, and decided Rendarth had to be slain, to give Ganrahast the message that the wards were to be left alone.</p>
