<p>Yahlir Smoothtongue was a honey -tongued adventuring bard and a historian, active in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Yahlir had a light heart, glib tongue, and light feet.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Yahlir claimed to have earned his bard title at a court in the Snowhigh Towers. No one knew of the place's existence, as it was likely completely fictional. By the age of twenty-two, Yahlir was known for being too brash and too boastful, uncharacteristically for a bard from any court in Faerûn . Despite that, Smoothtongue had a vast knowledge of history, lore, and songs. He valued ancient art and jewelry above all else. Yahlir made a living as an adventurer and a mercenary archeologist because being a poet paid little.</p>
<p>Sometime in the 14 th century DR, Yahlir Smoothtonguet was among adventurers interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed sorceress to retrieve the equally mysterious magical orb from its depths.</p>
