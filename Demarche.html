<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following Mask's loss of status in the divine hierarchy after the Time of Troubles , the amount of specialty priests in the church increased significantly. This was because Mask felt demarches fulfilled a useful support role for thieves, who made up the bulk of his base of worshipers, and so he furiously encouraged the recruitment and advancement of specialty priests. As of the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , demarches made up roughly forty percent of the Church of Mask, with regular priests making up about thirty percent. '</p>
<p>As of the 15 th century DR , the term demarche (and demarchess) referred to any priest of Mask.</p>
