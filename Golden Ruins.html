<p>The Golden Ruins were a series of ruins in the Eastern Plains of Cormyr .</p>
<p>They lay hidden in a valley situated some 10 miles (16 kilometers) off the Hullack Trail , and the same distance from the village of Ghars .</p>
<p>They were named for the yellow stone they were built from, much to the disappointment of would-be treasure hunters who sometimes visited here. Local folk stayed away, citing weird sounds and indistinct shapes glimpsed moving through buildings thick with brush.</p>
