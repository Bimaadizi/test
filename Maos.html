<p>Maos was a mysterious island that arose from the Moonsea every Shieldmeet when the sun set and sank at dawn's light.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>There were no written historical records of the island, but sages theorized it must have been part of an ancient human kingdom some time before −2000 DR . Moreover, no evidence was found for why Maos sank and rose, with the most likely explanation being magic , such as a curse invoked by ancient priests or even direct divine intervention.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Found roughly 40 miles (64 kilometers) south from Phlan , the island was perfectly circlular at precisely 240 feet (73 meters) in diameter. Its sudden rise to the surface during Shieldmeet generated great churning waves and sea foam. At dawn's light, the island quickly sank, creating a whirlpool that could drag ships within 100 yards (91 meters) of it below the waves.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>All around the island could be found dying fish, aquatic plant life and wet slime from its time at the seabed.</p>
<p>Below the surface, a labyrinthine network of caverns could be found.</p>
<p>On its surface were a number of structures. The grandest was a spire standing 225 feet (68.6 meters) high and built from a black and green stone that glistened with the moisture. This was widely believed to be a temple, but to an unknown deity . Underneath the altar could be found passage to the caverns below the island.</p>
<p>Another structure was a roofless observatory, circular in design, as well as all black in color. Strange symbols were inscribed all over the interior, while small stones jutted from the floor.</p>
<p>Several less remarkable structures were two or three stories tall, one of which also provided access to the caverns below. These structures were bare and empty.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The most dangerous feature of the island was its ability to negate all clerical magic (even magic items imbued with clerical magic).</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The island had no permanent population, but creatures that had been known to lair in the buildings were lacedons , kuo-toa , merrow , and scrags . Sea fauna such as giant octopi , giant crabs , and lampreys had also been seen.</p>
<h2>Legends</h2>
<p>The bard Mendryll Belarod , in his travels across the Moonsea, learned a little regarding the mysterious island. The existence of Maos was mostly known to sailors and sages, but the greater details of the island remained a mystery to both. Some sages claimed that Maos was a city of learning, or that it was even the home of an ancient human kingdom, predating the elves .</p>
<p>Mariners claimed the island was guarded by sea-creatures, even the animated dead of past victims. A great curse was said to be on the island, known only as "The Curse of Godly Silence." More positive rumors spoke of deep treasure vaults, full of long-forgotten spells , ancient artifacts and sentient swords .</p>
