<p>Cursed javelins were magical weapons that could be found in Zakhara , the Land of Fate.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These weapons looked exactly like regular javelins .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A single cursed javelin would be found mixed within a set of other magical javelins. The other magical javelins allowed the wielder to throw with more accuracy and pierced the target's armor more easily. When the wielder unknowingly threw the single cursed javelin , the missile would strike back at the unfortunate wielder with phenomenal force, causing more pain and harm than a strike from a regular javelin would.</p>
