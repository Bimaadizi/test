<p>Araithe was the le Shay prince and war leader of Sarifal on the island of Gwynneth in the Moonshae Isles as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Araithe was ageless like his le Shay kin, and had an almost predatory and grotesque beauty, with gray-hair and a calm face with a placid smile. He was about medium-height (maybe a bit taller). He spoke with a low voice.</p>
<p>Following a terrible injury inflicted by a wereboar , his right arm was replaced by a delicate golden prosthetic with elegant, clockwork fingers. He was prone to dress in a manner that was both inappropriate for fighting and generally ugly: he wore a tasseled codpiece , soft leather boots and gloves , purple moleskin trousers , and an open linen shirt or dublet , sometimes topped by a long velvet cloak or a velvet hat .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Araithe was not clever, but he was a pragmatist. He strove to appear calm and reserved, only allowing himself the most minor expressions of anger, however he was also proud, callous, and prone to petulance and violence when he felt slighted.</p>
<p>While he could be gracious and welcoming, he was quick to deceive, betray, and threaten when it suited him. He was contemptuous of those he deemed lesser than himself, and displayed no interest or ability to intuit the emotions of such people or creatures. He wore a self-satisfied smile in the midst of combat with lesser enemies.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Araithe wielded illusions that were particularly potent against intelligent creatures, and would weave psychic barriers around himself to deter his attackers. He had the ability to alter perceptions (such as by appearing to take away the light in a room), to slow the thoughts and stall the actions of those in his presence, to force his attackers to grovel and crawl, and even to take control of others to have them fight for him.</p>
<p>He could halt projectiles fired at him, making them slow and stop as if the air was too viscous for them to move forward. He could also summon and control fey creatures to do his bidding.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He handled most of the daily governmental functions of running Sarifal and its capital city of Karador , which he did on behalf of his mother, the High Lady Ordalf . He was also responsible for leading Sarifal's forces in its wars, and most notably fought to protect the realm from the unseelie fey issuing forth from Citadel Umbra in the Winterglen forest. His fey troops were considered the champions of Sarifal, although he himself was regarded by many as a tyrant.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Araithe was the son of Sarifal's ruler, the High Lady Ordalf, with whom he was close and fiercely protective despite their often hostile relationship. His family was obsessed with the purity of their bloodline, and as such, Araithe's grandfather was also his father, making him half-brother to his own mother. He and his mother subsequently had a son of their own, although he died a few days following his birth. Prior to this, Araithe had desired to have a child with his grandmother, Princess Callia , but she rejected him. When he discovered that she had instead had a daughter with an elf , he killed her and her lover in a jealous rage, and he then turned his desires toward grooming her daughter and his new aunt, Amaranth , into a future mate.</p>
<p>As of 1479 DR , there was a possibility of an arranged marriage between Araithe and Princess Tarilyn Kendrick of Callidyrr . Though Araithe showed no interest in a romantic relationship nor in the princess herself, he understood how such a union could both strengthen Sarifal against the many dangers it faced and perhaps position it to expand beyond the borders of Gwynneth. He thus invited Tarilyn to live as his guest in Karador.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Araithe was thousands of years old by the time he arrived from the Feywild onto Gwynneth alongside his mother in the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR . He soon was leading a century-long war against the humans of the Moonshaes that began with the conquest of Corwell and the expulsion of the humans from Gwynneth. While he questioned his mother's true reasons for returning to the Material plane , he had no time for doubts as his mind remained occupied with fighting both the humans and the dark fey of Winterglen.</p>
<p>Beginning in the early 15 th century DR, Araithe's tyrannical and monstrous tendencies began to lose him the support of the Llewyrr and eladrin of Sarifal, and over the next six decades, fewer and fewer deigned to follow him. This led him to make use of human slaves and to make empty promises to the drow beneath Gwynneth in order to secure them as a private army. He also orchestrated the capture of a fomorian princess named Marabaldia in the late 1460s DR, and held her for ten years as he extracted concessions from her people relating to the Pact of Eschatos , which allowed him to add cyclopes to his retinue. When Marabaldia escaped her captivity in the late 1470s DR, one of her fellow escapees, the lycanthrope Poke , subverted Araithe's illusions and destroyed his right arm, leading him to have it replaced with a prosthetic.</p>
<p>That same Spring, Araithe's aunt, Amaranth, returned to Gwynneth after having vanished as a child a decade prior. While he invited her to stay with him, his mother—who wished Amaranth dead—intervened and attempted to humiliate them both, leading to an altercation between mother and son. Amaranth then fled to join Araithe's discontented subjects in Synnoria , but was pursued by Araithe and his army of drow and eladrin. She ultimately chose to parlay with him to secure the escape of her friend, Captain Lukas , and his allies.</p>
<p>For some time, Araithe held Citadel Umbra and used it as his base. As of 1479 DR, the Citadel was held by unseelie fey led by Urphania , and Araithe's forces had fought to a stalemate against them within Winterglen. At the same time, he was engaged in negotiations with King Derid Kendrick of Callidyrr as they both sought to strengthen their realms through alliance.</p>
<p>By 1489 DR , Araithe was known to waive Sarifal's usual policy of isolationism to recruit adventurers from across the Strait of Alaron to aid him in his struggle in Winterglen.</p>
