<p>Roland the Minstrel was a minstrel in the Oasis of the White Palm the time of Khalitharius ' release in 1356Â DR .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Roland's only possession of note was a lute .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Roland sometimes wandered the oasis, but from dawn to dusk he was just plucking notes out of his lute in the common room of the Sandvoyagers' Guild . Though he was secretive and didn't answer many questions, he preferred to give the impression he knew a great deal.</p>
<p>What he knew was limited to a few facts. First amongst them was that Martek had originally created the ruins under the Oasis as well as those at Phoenix , long before they were dedicated to Set ; he still chose to hide his Star Gems in them. He also knew that Martek, the greatest mage of his time, had foreseen the future and left a gift to the Sultanate of the tribes, giving them the knowledge of where the Great Good slept, to be loosed when the Great Evil (almost certainly Khalitharius ) came. He also knew that the ancient city of Phoenix was located west by northwest of the Oasis. He knew that Martek had delivered unto the Pharaohs of his day the five gems known as the Star Gems of Mo-Pelar, Shah-Pelar, Khan-Pelar, Aga-Pelar, and Melos-Pelar, items of great mystery, but his greatest creation was actually his own citadel.</p>
<p>Finally, he knew a bit of Martek's Epic.</p>
