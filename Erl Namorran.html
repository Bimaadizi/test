<p>Erl Namorran was the Harbormaster of Baldur's Gate in 1482 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Erl was a serious and strict man, who did everything by the rules. He was also very intelligent, and was skilled at managing financial accounts. However, he did not have much common sense or social skills.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Harbormaster worked at the Harbormaster's Office in the Lower City , and kept watch over the Harbor Manifest . When Erl spoke to the manifest, the magic device automatically recorded his words.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Prior to Ulder Ravengard becoming duke, the astute Namorran correctly predicted that this would occur. As such, he maintained good relations with the marshal.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Erl was once a distinguished member of the Flaming Fist . During a state event where Duke Torlin Silvershield made a speech, Erl commented about how improper Evelyn Silvershield 's corset was to his superior, Abdel Adrian . Adrian's wild laughter caused Duke Silvershield to stop his speech, and after this, Adrian never explained why he had laughed so boisterously. Not too long after these events, Abdel Adrian recommended Erl to become Harbormaster to the other dukes.</p>
<p>Erl retired from his role in the Fist before becoming the Harbormaster of Baldur's Gate. During his post, he raised tariffs on fine goods, such as luxury items, as his friend, Marshal Ravengard, asked. Some time later, a famed ex-adventurer, Coran , suggested to the Heroes of the Wide that they find out who was stockpiling goods in the Gate. He proposed that they speak with Namorran, so that they could examine the Harbor Manifest.</p>
<p>He continued to serve in this role until at least 1482 DR. About a decade later, Darus Kelinoth was the Harbormaster of the city.</p>
