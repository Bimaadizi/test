<p>Astar's ring belonged to Astar Graysteel, one of the Blades of Mulmaster in the mid-14 th century DR. His life was filled with dangers and double-crossings in service of Selfaril Uoumdolphin . Astar met Lana Graysteel, and they quickly fell in love and were wed with Astar's ring given to the young bride as a wedding band. Years later, Astar was betrayed by Selfaril and was denounced as a criminal. Astar Graysteel was forced to flee Mulmaster, and to protect his wife's life, he left without explanation. Several years later, Lana Graysteel was still grieving for her lost love. After Astar Graysteel's death at the tentacles of the malaugrym who wore the face of Eremuth Silverwind , the dead Blade's comrades traveled to Mulmaster and gave the grieving woman Astar's letter that revealed the truth about his departure. Saddened but relieved, she gave up Astar's ring as a way of turning a new page in her life.</p>
