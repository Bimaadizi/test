<p>Coral plate armor were sets of heavy armor ensorcelled with minor enchantments of sahuagin creation.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These sets of aquatic coral plate mail were similar in construction to splint mail worn by the inhabitants of the land and were used almost exclusively by sahuagin . The armor's base was tight sharkskin leather with tough coral plates affixed to protect shoulders, chest, and wrist areas. Its aquatic nature and design made it uncomfortable and restrictive when worn by races other than sahuagin.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Coral plate armor possessed enchantments that provided good protection from fire and acid . It also was more effective at stopping piercing weapons than slashing.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , sahuagin that dwelt within an ancient temple on the Isle of the Great Wyrm in the Sea of Moving Ice were armored with these sets of coral plates.</p>
