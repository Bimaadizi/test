<p>The Shaeradim , also referred in part as the High Shaeradim , was the name given of the twelve hills that surrounded the elven settlement of Evereska .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The hills stood nearly 6,000 ft (1.8 km) high for much of its length and were surrounded for 15 mi (24 km) by lesser hills and narrow vales. They were considered largely impassable for those unknowledgeable about how to navigate within.</p>
<p>There was a pass that wound through the hills known to the elves of Evereska. Any outsider brought along this path by the elves had to be blindfolded along their journey.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Notable peaks within the Shaeradim included the northwestern mountain Ilaerothil , meaning "the Sentinel", and the southeastern mount of Eastpeak , located 15 mi (24 km) away from each other.</p>
<p>The stretch of foothills that seperated the Shaeradim from Anauroch desert were referred as the Desert Border.</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>There was a large valley within the hills, west of Evereska called the West Cwm .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The depths beneath the Shaeradim became a critical point of interest to many in the Heartlands of Faerûn in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR . In Nightal that year, the Sharn Wall beneath the Shaeradim was breached and the phaerimm trapped behind were let loose.</p>
<p>Within a tenday after their escape, the phaerimm erected the Deadwall around the Shaeradim and Evereska Vale , an invisible magical barrier that nullified magical teleportation or communication, and killed anything that attempted to physically pass through it. By the end of the month, the elves estimated that 200 of the monstrosities took up residence within the hills.</p>
