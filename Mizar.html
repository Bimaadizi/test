<p>Mizar was the label attached to a depiction of a supernatural creature, most likely a demon , represented in a fresco found in an Imaskari ruin within the border of Veldorn and Estagund . "Mizar" was most likely meant to be its name. The creature depicted resembled a midnight black centaur with a horn in the middle of its forehead, in the manner of a unicorn ; the eyes of the fresco showed hellish glee. The figure of an Imaskari artificer , labeled Umyatin , was reaching towards it.</p>
