<p>The Company of the Lynx was an adventuring company that operated out of Cormyr during the midâ€“14 th century DR . It was led by Knorrel Talbot and its members included the burly Goulart , along with twin magic-users , Bartholeme and Parys Guin , among others.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , the company's found a lead on the whereabouts of a dead dragon , whose innards contained documents it had consumed when attacking a group of diplomats traveling across the Anauroch desert bound for King Azoun IV Cormyr . The documents were a series of scrolls that listed the true names of prominent Red Wizards from Thay , and could be used to great effect against the foreign cabal.</p>
<p>These scrolls were sealed away in magically -protected containers appeared quite dangerous to open. Knorrel Talbot temporarily hired on the lone spellcaster Midnight to unseal the container, lied to her about their contents, then planned to kill the young woman. When Midnight uncovered their plan, she stole the true name scrolls and fled in the middle of the night. When the Company of the Lynx continued in pursuit and were just about to reach her, Midnight prayed to her goddess Mystra and the entire group was struck down in a blast of blue-white fire. Only Mystra survived and the Company of the Lynx was no more.</p>
