<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gorothir was a powerful priest of Shar, active around the Fall of Netheril . Around the Year of Glassharks, −310 DR , he came into possession of a divine relic of the Mistress of the Night—the eponymous girdle . The origin of the Girdle was unclear: some believed that the powerful priest created it, whereas others believed it was gifted to her high priest by the Dark Lady herself.</p>
<p>Due to his tremendous power and tyrannical nature, Gorothir was feared as much as he was hated. During the Year of the Unblinking Eye, 446 DR his grandchilden allied with several of his enemies, from disgruntled mages to rulers whose thrones were usurped. The motley alliance ambushed him while he was raiding a place of power sacred to Selûne , during an event which would later be known as the Night of Dark Fire . They managed to kill him in a massive conflagration of magic which killed most of them as well. After this victory an archmage of Selûne shattered the staff of the high priest, losing his life in the process. As for his belt , it was salvaged by one of his descendants and played a major part in the history of the Church of Shar afterwards.</p>
<p>During the Year of the Shadowkin Return, 1136 DR , the whispers of the Dark Goddess led Lord Vanrak Moonstar to find the remains of Gorothir and of his staff. The Dark Ranger built a crypt to store those blessed relics in his base of Vanrakdoom , deep in Undermountain . The relics were kept in a sarcophagus resting on the desecrated Plinth Stone of the Moonmaiden . To reward this act of great devotion, Shar restored the Shadowstaff to its former power and sent a couple angels of decay to watch over the relics.</p>
