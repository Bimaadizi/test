<p>The Rod of Oblivion was a magical rod and artifact wielded by the goddess Shar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Time of Troubles in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , the avatar of Shar appeared in Waterdeep , where she masqueraded as the avatar of her divine rival, Selûne , until she was exposed by the adventurers Vajra Valmeyjar , Kyriani , Onyx the Invincible , Timoth Eyesbright , and Luna who was the true avatar of Selûne. Finally, amidst the ruins of the Selûne's Smile inn she'd destroyed, Shar confronted the heroes. Wielding the Rod of Oblivion in all its dark glory, Shar threatened to have her revenge on them and to slay Selûne once and for all. She very nearly achieved this, but the adventurers released Selûne's full divine power to Luna. The revitalized avatar of Selûne cancelled the Rod of Oblivion and destroyed the avatar of Shar. The rod fell to the ground.</p>
<p>It was apparently recovered and kept within the vaults of the House of the Moon , the temple of Selûne in Waterdeep, by 1370 DR .</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR , a similar but much less powerful implement called the lesser Oblivion had been created and was used by the Sharran priestess Storna Harnwood in Wheloon Prison .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Some 3 feet (0.91 meters), it had a golden shaft and was topped by a dark-hued emerald , cut in three distinct levels and the size of a fist. When active, jet-black lightning shot forth from the gem in all directions.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The true powers of the Rod of Oblivion were known only to Shar, but its touch was said to have the same effect as contacting the River Styx , that is, to inflict complete amnesia on its victim. During her battle in Waterdeep, Shar used the rod to conjure a great black tendril to snatch up Luna and torment her. It seemed able to destroy the weakened goddess. The rod's full powers and true nature are unknown, but likely depend on darkness. Restored to her full power, the avatar of Selûne dismissed its darkness with a light spell.</p>
