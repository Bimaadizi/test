<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1035 DR , the Sharran clergy fell under the sway of a vampire who hid themselves within the temple's basement. Also around this time, the normally irreligious Hultmarks became frequent visitors to the temple, falling under the sway of its vampire.</p>
<p>Eventually, the vampire lord Artor Morlin noticed that vampire activity around the city had increased, to such a degree that their rise in population could endanger Waterdeep. Promising his ruler Ahghairon that he would try to keep the city free of other vampires, Artor hired a group of adventurers to seek out and eradicate vampire nests in the city. This mission eventually lead them to the Hultmark Manor , where Joy Hultmark informed them she suspects the Temple of Shar as being a vampire den. When the adventurers made their way to the temple they found the Hultmarks inside, debating whether or not to remain loyal to their master.</p>
