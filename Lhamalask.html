<p>The Lhamalask clan was one of the twenty dynastic families that formed the Onsruur (the council of lords) in Khôltar , south Faerûn , circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>This bloodline trended to the short, stout, and sturdy body type with a quick gait over short distances. All of these characteristics were at odds with their love of fashion and expensive clothing—they lacked elegance in their walk and tailoring fabric to their frames often accentuated the wrong features, failing to fit the beauty standards of their time. Their pretension made them somewhat of a private joke among the other Onsruur families.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Lhamalasks were one of the few families that were not heavily into ironmongery in the Iron City. They made most of their fortune manufacturing and selling perfumes, scents, oils, ointments, poisons , antidotes, and potions, both magic and mundane.</p>
