<p>Humanoid was a general term for the enormous variety of sentient species that made up the world's primary inhabitants, both savage and civilized. They were capable of language, culture, and in many cases of learning magic .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Humanoids were typically bipedal, having two arms, two legs, and walking upright. But they varied widely in terms of size and features. Most did not have innate spellcasting abilities (notable exceptions included the drow ) and they were generally capable of using tools and weapons.</p>
<h2>Sub-Families</h2>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>The most numerous humanoid societies were those of the dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans.</p>
<p>A few other humanoid races were far more primitive and generally evil , or hostile, such as gnolls , goblinoids, kobolds , lizardfolk , and orcs. These species were not considered demihumans and often lived within clans or tribes.</p>
<p>Sometimes these humanoids would go against the norms of their societies and take up the life of an adventurer . They often faced prejudice along the way, with inns having rules against serving them, shops refusing to do business with them, authorities watching them closely for signs of trouble, and unscrupulous humans and demihumans fearing them or wishing to exploit them. Some humanoids faced physical limitations, especially in communities which were built with smaller or larger humanoids in mind, or those of a different body type. They could also require weapons specially designed for someone of their size.</p>
