<p>The Citadel of the Bloody Hand was a notorious stronghold hidden high inside Mount Waterdeep and considered part of the upper Dungeon Level of Undermountain . Some insisted it should be called the Citadel of the Black Hand .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Citadel of the Bloody Hand was first developed in the Year of the Black Wind, 1262 DR as a base of operations for a local thieves' guild â€”either the Shadow Thieves or the Thieves' Guild of Waterdeep . The thieves managed to secure the area against Undermountain's monsters and defended it with many traps, and named it for their guildmaster.</p>
<p>However, the thieves' guild was later run out of Waterdeep. The fate of their base afterward was unknown; it might've been abandoned, seized by the Lords of Waterdeep , or infested again by monsters.</p>
<p>However, by the 1360s DR , part of the Citadel of the Bloody Hand had been taken over by the Harpers and made part of Harpers' Hold . The rest was occupied by the City Guard , who walled off the head of the Falling Stair to block incursions from Undermountain to the dungeons of Castle Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The Citadel of the Bloody Hand contained many lethal traps and wards left by the Shadow Thieves; some were repurposed to defend a passageway to Harpers' Hold. The area of Undermountain around it was also rife with traps and guardian creatures, as well as spy-holes and secret passages.</p>
<p>Under the City Guard, the Citadel was occupied by some 46 Guardsmen and a number of wizards and priests .</p>
