<p>Carston was a very powerful mage who managed to control the Machine of Lum the Mad .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The human wizard was a master with several apprentices that followed his lead. He had short blonde hair, and wore a green robe .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Carston appeared to be bold and arrogant, but in fact was very cowardly. The wizard kept a journal, in which he explained that he was too afraid to leave the machine, and he missed "Mumsy" ever so much. As with the namesake of the machine, it is possible that the mage had gone mad.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As well as being able to control some functions of the extraordinarily complicated Machine of Lum the Mad (such as firing destructive spells and summoning planar creatures), Carston was a supremely skilled wizard. He had the ability to cast the most difficult spells , such as time stop and wail of the banshee .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the midâ€“14 th century DR , Carston and his apprentices ventured through Watcher's Keep , Amn . The master wizard became trapped in the Machine of Lum the Mad , and made the most of the situation. He kept himself entertained by summoning planar creatures, such as githyanki and mind flayers , which always fought each other to the death, or until Carston got bored.</p>
<p>About ten years later, in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Abdel Adrian and his company of adventurers arrived in the keep, and met with Carston. What happened to Carston after this meeting is unknown.</p>
