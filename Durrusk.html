<p>Durrusk was one of the nine founding members of the Great Goblet crime syndicate and one of two doppelgangers in the inner circle, circa the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Durrusk typically wore the guise of merchants that it had murdered. When dealing with agents or hirelings, the form chosen was intended to be seen by any Waterdhavian spies that might be encountered, for the purpose of sowing confusion and doubt about the loyalty of the servants working for the noble merchant families that were enemies of the Great Goblet.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Durrusk rarely expressed opinions in council with the other Lords of the Goblet. It brought information to the group gathered by its agents and contacts and often knew details that were important to the decision-making process.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Each of the Lords possessed a golden goblet that was part of a set belonging to Halonidas Dreie , whose assassination was the pivotal event in the forming of the Great Goblet. Each Lord was expected to keep a desiccated finger or toe of the victim in the goblet as a warning against inter-council treachery.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Durrusk was part of a handful of doppelgangers that had been captured and were being transported overland from Baldur's Gate to the Sea of Fallen Stars region (for reasons known only to the buyer). The shipment was intercepted by agents of a merchant cabal and the doppelgangers were offered partnerships in the organization to be spies and liaisons. This worked out well for a time, but two were caught trying to replace other members and were put to death in front of Durrusk and the others as a warning.</p>
