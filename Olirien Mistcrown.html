<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the fomorian king Malabog threatened the elves of New Sharandar circa the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Olirien took lead over a forward outpost in the giant-king's personal domain in the Feywild . He put aside his differences with the people of Neverwinter for a time, and worked with adventurers from the city to halt the efforts of Malabog's elven general Celadaine .</p>
<p>To begin, Olirien organized foraging efforts to ensure his soldiers had enough food to survive the counter-siege. Once that was taken care of, he orchestrated the destruction of the siege weaponry that was being constructed by Malabog's redcap minions. Finally, Olirien tasked the Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge with the siege of the Tower of Celadaine , home to the black knight of Malabog's army, an elf he once called a close friend.</p>
