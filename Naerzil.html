<h2>Abilities</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Narvo was one of four Red Wizards that teleported into the meeting place of the Rightful Conspiracy in Marsember after the raid by the War Wizards of Cormyr during the early spring of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR . He trapped Caladnei using a spell that created rope-like bindings of flame. On arrival, he was greeted by Thauvas Zlorn, who told him not to harm Caladnei for they had use for her; Narvo responded by warning him that he had outlived his usefulness and his prospects at remaining alive were dim, thus, he was not interested in Thauvas' input.</p>
<p>In response, Thauvas quietly killed him with an unknown spell, but which Elminster Aumar mimed behind him, almost certainly indicating that Thauvas was under Elminster's control.</p>
