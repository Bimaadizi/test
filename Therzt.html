<p>Therzt , known simply as the Chosen of Ghaunadaur , was a male drow priest and the self-proclaimed Chosen of Ghaunadaur in the mid-to-late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He was apparently responsible for the transformation of Neverwinter 's polluted Blacklake into a magical sludge. In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , following the siege of Neverwinter , Therzt summoned sludge-covered zombies from out of Blacklake to attack the waterfront of the Blacklake District , making a wrecked ship his base. The alchemist Hazel led the defense while Piniwin and Penny sought aid from adventurers; aided by her alchemist's fire , they defeated Therzt and the undead.</p>
<p>In 1486 DR , Therzt somehow reappeared as a captive of the Red Wizards of Thay , in Doomvault . When freed by adventurers working for the Thayan Resurrection , he began babbling that he needed to die for his weakness and cast an acid arrow spell on himself, dying as he proclaimed his devotion to Ghaunadaur.</p>
