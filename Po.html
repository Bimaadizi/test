<p>Po was an emperor somewhere in Kara-Tur in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At first, Po's favorite nephew was Hai Chi , who was even considered a candidate to succeed him when he died. After nearly a decade, however, word of Hai Chi's crimes and tyranny—including bashing his wife Shichi No Ken and murdering their child—came to the attention of his father and his uncle the emperor, and they were compelled to bring him to justice. Po sent his soldiers to apprehend Hai Chi and his men as he attacked the Seven Roses Monastery in Pe Nok to kill Shichi and the monks, but they found she had slain him. Emperor Po and Hai Chi's father were even grateful: she had saved them the need for a shameful trial and public execution.</p>
