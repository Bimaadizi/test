<p>Teleportation bolts were a type of enchanted crossbow ammunition created by an adventurer named Visgove .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These enchanted bolts were not designed to deal damage to the target, instead, upon a successful impact, they teleported the target towards the shooter via magic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Visgove was an adventurer renowned for his spectacular laziness. No one was surprised when the man sank a significant amount of coin into developing these magic bolts sometime before 1372 DR . Why would Visgove run across a battlefield when it was much easier to transport an enemy directly into the range of his battle axe .</p>
<p>Even though expensive, by 1373 DR , teleportation bolts were in use in Zhentil Keep of the Moonsea region.</p>
