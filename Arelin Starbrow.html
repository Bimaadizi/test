<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the early 1360s DR , Arelin Starbrow was a renowned hero of Skull Crag and a beloved Roadwarden. Locals often shared tales of Arelin's and her son, Vidruand's heroics. Her career and life ended when she and the Chief of the Roadwarden Guard, Sir Dutiocs , were ambushed by monsters of an encroaching horde. Sir Dutiocs rushed back to the Skull Crag Keep with Arelin's body, leaving behind the symbol of the office she wielded in battle – the Arms of the Roadwarden.</p>
