<p>Ultoksamrin was one of the subkingdoms of Deep Shanatar . After the dwarven kingdom fell, it was taken over by non- dwarves .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Ultoksamrin was situated beneath the eastern Marching Mountains in Calimshan and the Forest of Mir . The former subkingdom consisted of the ruling cavern, a 1000-ft-high (300 m) grotto, a mile beneath Mount Sarengard , and of several tunnels.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>After the fall of Old Shanatar , the former subkingdom Ultoksamrin was emptied of dwarves. By 1372 DR , several non-dwarf races occupied territory of Ultoksamrin's tunnels. The different races fought over additional territory.</p>
<p>The ones who were most successful at it were the drow . These drow were followers of the deity Vhaeraun and were escapees from Guallidurth , from where they fled religious persecution. They were situated in the Vault of Cloaked Midnight , the cathedral city. The temple of the city covered about half of the ruling cavern and the drow lived in former clanholds of the dwarves for protection.</p>
