<p>Channathgate was a community in the Channath Vale of the Shaar .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The settlement sat near the River Channath at the eastern end of the Channath Vale between the Channathwood to the north and the Swagdar and the Forest of Amtar to the south. It lay along Trader's Way between Rethmar to the west and the Landrise and Three Swords to the east.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Channathgate reaped the benefits of caravan trade through the Channath Vale. In addition, farmers on the outskirts of the settlement also traded with the ghostwise halflings of the Channathwood.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The community had a tentative relationship with the halflings of the Channathwood, who did not permit them to travel into their forest except to forage for herbs and berries on the fringes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the Shaar was conquered by the Shoon Imperium in the Year of the Late Sun, 300 DR , several Shaaran towns rebelled in the Year of Willing Sacrifice, 435 DR , including Channathgate. This led to a brutal reprisal known as the Seven Burnings campaign: between 438 DR and 440 DR , Shoon armies rampaged through the communities of the Shaar, including Channathgate, and killed or displaced many locals. Even so, the Shaar had gained independence from Shoon rule by the end of the Year of Unleashed Fears, 451 DR .</p>
<p>As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , the area around Channathgate faced a number of threats out of the nearby Forest of Amtar. This included a number of bandit groups—such as those led by the ogre mage Tandith Tornears or the half-fiend Tanushk Versix —as well as gnolls operating out of the Gate of Iron Fangs and trolls .</p>
