<p>Black Shaernauba was a werewyvern brigand reputed to dwell within the Storm Horns mountains in Cormyr in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>A subject of local legend, Black Shaernauba robbed travelers on the High Road . If they got the better of her, she transformed into a wyvern and flew back to her lair. This was said to be a cave in the mountains, stuffed with coins and gems . She was even said to kidnap handsome men and keep them captive there.</p>
<p>Supposedly, she'd even murdered Purple Dragons who tried to establish an outpost in the hamlet of Wyvernhunt and people who tried to build inns there. However, Volothamp Geddarm thought this unlikely, as Cormyr's Purple Dragons and War Wizards wouldn't be deterred by one bandit, even if a werewyvern, if they'd been serious.</p>
