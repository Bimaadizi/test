<p>Lady Alvilda Margaster was a member of House Margaster in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationship</h2>
<p>Alvilda was the cousin of Lady Inkeri Margaster . They grew very close to each other, even considering each other sisters instead of cousins.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Dwarvenkind Reborn, 1488 DR , the halfling rogue Regis met Alvilda and Lady Inkeri Margaster at the Driftwood Tavern near Neverwinter . The Margasters held a party there and during the dances Regis gained from his dance partner Alvilda some useful information about Inkeri's plots.</p>
<p>Later that year, Alvilda gave birth to a baby girl named Sharon , who appeared somehow corrupted, perhaps as a result of the family's trade in demonic phylacteries , but in truth the infant was a rare type of fiend . Because of the child, the two cousins fell out with one another. Their conflict came to a head when Alvilda and Inkeri managed to capture Regis and Dahlia Sin'felle , who had infiltrated the Margaster estate in Waterdeep . Instigated by Sharon, the two cousins fully transformed into demons and fought each other, until Alvilda beheaded Inkeri.</p>
