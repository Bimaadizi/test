<p>Felrivenser , also known as Gembright , was an amethyst dragon who dwelled in the Channel Lock within the empire of Netheril in the first to third millennia before Dalereckoning .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>She was first recorded when she arrived on one of the northern locks in 1027 NY (−2832 DR) , then only an adult dragon. She claimed all the surrounding lands as her own and made her lair on an island.</p>
<p>Thereafter, knowing her as Gembright, a handful of curious Netherese archwizards made their way there to talk about magic , the affairs of dragons , and matters in society of the time.</p>
<p>Gembright lived there over two millennia and grew to become an ancient wyrm, but something forced her to leave her island in 3214 NY (−645 DR) . She never came back.</p>
<p>Living elsewhere, she survived a few more centuries, becoming a mighty great wyrm.</p>
<p>By the 14 th century DR, Felrivenser was considered to be long deceased.</p>
<h3>Legacy</h3>
<p>In the 3 rd century DR, the sorceress Chassabra , called the Lady of Swirling Stones and a ruler of the Mlembryn Lands by the River Dessarin , researched her genealogy and discovered she was a descendant of Felrivenser. What's more, she was believed to have found Felrivenser's treasure hoard and stashed it in an extradimensional space accessed only by a portal unlocked by her pendant . Eventually, she transformed herself into an amethyst half-dragon and abandoned her tower and her realm.</p>
