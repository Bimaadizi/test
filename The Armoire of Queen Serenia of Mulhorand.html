<p>The Armoire of Queen Serenia of Mulhorand was a unique and humble armoire that belonged to the wife of Pharaoh , Sorenhotep I , of the Second Empire of Mulhorand .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Queen Serenia's Armoire was tiny, not what one expected from a cabinet that belonged to royalty. It was a relatively tiny chest made of the finest wood . Its construction and decoration were done with the highest levels of artistry.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Armoire of Queen Serenia of Mulhorand dated back to the waning days of the Second Empire of Mulhorand. The kingdom's young Pharaoh, Sorenhotep I, was convinced that he needed a queen of beauty greater than any other mortal woman of the Realms . The Pharaoh sent messengers to all, even the farthest part of the world, in search of such a wife. One of the royal messengers returned with the story of the fey princess Serenia . Without hesitation, Sorenhotep organized a caravan to the princess's land and placed a Mulhorandi diplomat as its leader with five thousand soldiers, one hundred wizards , forty bards , dozens of wagons made from gold , cages full of animals from the royal zoo, mechanical wonders from the Mulhorandi workshops, truly a delegation to behold.</p>
<p>Serenia was not impressed by the wonders and lavish gifts sent her way. Many kings had the same treasures to brag about. Princess informed the Mulhorandi ambassador that only one thing could win her hand in marriage – if the king could present her the fabled unicorn of Ganathwood so the princess could ride on its back to the wedding. Sorenhotep consulted his royal magicians but was informed that no one could capture the beast; it was amazingly strong and fast, besting all hunters who had ever tried. Only a fair and pure maiden could distract the creature long enough for it to be harnessed. The Pharaoh ordered the kingdom's young maidens to be gathered and sent to Ganathwood, but months passed by, and none of the Mulhorandi girls were successful.</p>
<p>Princess Serenia was surprised to see the Mulhorandi diplomat return to her court with good news – the legendary unicorn was captured, but the princess had to travel to Ganathwood, where Sorenhotep kept the beast. Serenia complied and was greeted with no man, no soldier, just the forest. It did not take long for the fabled unicorn to present itself and lay its head on the princess's lap. Suddenly, the Mulhorandi soldiers leaped from their hiding and roped the unicorn.</p>
<p>Princess Serenia was outraged by the deception at first, but eventually came to a realization that the crafty Pharaoh did just what she asked of him and simply outwitted her. She agreed to the marriage and became Queen Serenia of Mulhorand.</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , The Armoire of Queen Serenia of Mulhorand was displayed in Mintassan's Mysteries , a curio magic goods shop of Westgate . The history of Queen Serenia was attached to the armoire's knob, written on a small piece of paper .</p>
