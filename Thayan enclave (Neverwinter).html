<p>The Thayan enclave in Neverwinter was the embassy and a trading organization run by the Red Wizards of Thay that was allowed to be built in the Tyr's Eye plaza of the Blacklake District after 1374 DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The enclave stood out among other buildings on the plaza. It was built in a Thayan fashion – a roughly pyramids-like structure that stood behind a guarded metal gate.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The Thayan enclave opened directly into the shop. It was a spacious, richly decorated room with dark wooden floorings, wall tapestries, exotic potted plants, bookshelves , and other magical miscellany. The merchant's counter was direct to the right side from the entrance and was manned by a single gruff but trained gnoll . Past the shop, through a door on the left, were Akila's laboratory and research archives.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the Shadow War of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR and with the war with Luskan just two years prior, the trade and economy on the Sword Coast North were in shambled. Desperate to boost the commerce in the Jewel of the North, Nasher Alagondar opened the gates, conditionally, to a Thayan enclave. It was built on the Tyr's Eye plaza in Neverwinter, and aged Red Wizard Akila was appointed as its khazark. The enclave offered Thayan goods for trade while Akila focused his arcane research on a recently emerged phenomenon – arcane nexuses . The Red Wizard enjoyed the autonomy that the Thayan enclave in Neverwinter brought. He was performing an ambassadorial role with the crown of Neverwinter, but the business between Thay and the North was light.</p>
<p>To no surprise, locals mistrusted the Red Wizard trade outpost. One individual from Neverwinter attempted to break in for some nefarious season but ended up trapped in the enclave's defensive contraptions. Even though the invader was freed by the Thayan gnoll named Mugen , the man fled from the plaza in utter terror.</p>
<p>As the north began its recovery, Neverwinter allowed crown-sponsored mercantile firms to operate in the region. The enclave and one of the coasters began dealing with the Mercantile House of Samarach led by a merchant princess Sa'Sani . Her business partners agreed to help Akila in studying the arcane nexuses that recently popped up across Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Thayan enclave in Neverwinter was staffed with trained gnolls from the Unapproachable East . The guards were gnolls dressed in distinctly Thayan armor. Evidently, these humanoids were not the best-suited individuals for such jobs as they leered at passersby aggressively, looking for the smallest provocation. The enclave was also worked by sinister constructs that resembled golems used by the King of Shadows during the recent Shadow War. These giant walking suits of armor, armed with deadly blades, were indeed the remnants of the King of Shadows' army, reassembled, reactivated, and painted red.</p>
