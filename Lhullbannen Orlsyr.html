<p>Lhullbannen Orlsyr was a human fighter and the owner and innkeeper of The Wizard's Hand in the village of Maskyr's Eye in the Vast in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>Lhullbannen was the son of Riothar Orlsyr , the builder of The Wizard's Hand.</p>
<p>He had a very large wife and four daughters described as beautiful tomboys.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Aged 53 circa 1357 DR , Lhullbannen had retired from the life of a fighter, but was too busy with the running of the inn to train any would-be warriors, short of a significant payment and being well-disposed to the student. Of course, he was also very particular about the running of the inn and was unwilling to leave the day-to-day business of the inn to his wife and daughters, expecting they wouldn't run it to the same high standards.</p>
