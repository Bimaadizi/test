<h2>History</h2>
<p>Belarla's work as a Harper and a pleasure queen of Zhentil Keep continued until the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , when Mirt called upon her to aid Shandril Shessair after her first assault on the Citadel of the Raven . They followed her afterwards when she set out to attack the Wizards' Tower . When she was prevented from reaching that location by the patrols in the city, Belarla pacified Shandril using a sedative embedded in a napkin to prevent her from giving away their location, and helped fight off one wizard , for the trip across the sewers to Myrintara 's home.</p>
<p>Myrintara later transported them to the Lonesome Tankard in Eveningstar . There, she argued in favor of Shandril striking again at the Zhents, rather that fleeing to Silverymoon . During the tussle with the forces of Fzoul Chembryl at the Wizards' Tower, Belarla was struck senseless early, taking her out of the fight. She survived the fight, however, and was healed by a kiss from Shandril and her spellfire , getting well enough to leave on her own power soon after.</p>
<p>Later that year, Belarla was drinking with Mirt when he and Asper were called magically to the aid of Shandril in the moments leading up to her death.</p>
