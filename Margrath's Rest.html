<p>Margrath's Rest was a rocky beach west of Suzail used as a ship graveyard, named for an old naval captain called Margrath who spent his retirement on the shore there.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Decades after it stopped being used, the rocky coast was still home to several prominent wrecks inhabited by a profusion of eels and clams that found homes in the underwater hulks.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before the reign of King Azoun IV , the beach was used for the disposal of large, decrepit ships that couldn't be effectively handled at sea. The ships were ran aground onto the shore and stripped of any valuable or useful fittings, with the timbers left to rot. The beach eventually fell out of use, but during the 14 th century DR it was still home to many rotted hulks.</p>
