<p>Sunsteen Urbeth was a citizen of Loudwater in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sunsteen was physically fit with the notable exception of his right leg, which was shriveled and thus required him to use a cane to walk. This injury was caused by a spellscar located on his right thigh.</p>
<p>He was going bald.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Sunsteen was a natural sycophant. He was polite, always sought to please, and was happy to share rumors and information he knew. He ended most of his sentences with a pause before asking "right?"</p>
<p>He was prone to repressing any feelings of agitation lest they activate his spellscar.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Sunsteen's spellscar gave him no special powers, although it wreathed his whole right leg in blue flames when it activated. These activations were painful enough to incapacitate him.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Sunsteen was an assistant to the magistrate of Loudwater, which put him in a position to be well informed about illegal activities in and around the town. This included the activities of bandits operating out of the ruins of Zelbross as well as rumors about the so-called " Lady of Shadows " who operated a gang from the catacombs beneath Loudwater.</p>
<p>His favorite haunts were Loudwater's South Square and the Green Tankard tavern.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He was in his early thirties as of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , when he was in Loudwater's South Square when it was attacked by a group of goblins . The goblins were beaten back by adventurers , and Sunsteen was convinced that he would have been killed if not for their intervention. Out of gratitude, he sought them out to thank them, and then continued to try to contact them, hoping to ingratiate himself with them by offering whatever information or political help he could.</p>
