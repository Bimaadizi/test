<p>The Trade Harbor was located in Huzuz , the City of Delights, along the banks of Al-Sarif River .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This large harbor had enough docks to support 40 galleys or dromonds with an additional 75 cogs . All of the docks were well-maintained to accommodate the constant influx of vessels.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>A constant bustle of activity permeated every available space of the Trade Harbor. This section of Huzuz acted like a small city, with many of the thousands of workers never even leaving the area during their lifetimes.</p>
<p>Each incoming ship had their wares assessed by a tax collector to determine the tax to be paid. After paying the tax, the ship was assigned a dock where they could unload their merchandise. Since the Trade Harbor was crammed at times, marids were often used to pull ships to their docks.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Many of the wealthy merchant families employed genies , ogres , and giants to facilitate the movement of trade goods.</p>
<p>Several platoons of the Dauntless Mamluk Society were always present around the docks to maintain security and apprehend thieves for justice.</p>
