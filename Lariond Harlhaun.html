<p>Lariond Harlhaun was a member of the Harlhaun merchant family in Delzimmer circa the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Harlhauns tended to be tall and thin, with high cheekbones and large, dark eyes, and Lariond was no exception.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Lariond and his younger brother Narthel thought of themselves as rivals for taking over the family business from their aging father. They unwisely dismissed their older sister Arleithe as a candidate, and instead, endlessly plotted against each other as they vied for prominence and attempted to sabotage each other's plans.</p>
