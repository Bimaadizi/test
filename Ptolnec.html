<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ptolnec was a lieutenant in Innarlith's city guard by the Year of the Blazing Brand, 1334 DR . Pristoleph , the future Ransar of Innarlith, was a soldier under his command at the time. Pristoleph was helping to operate a brothel at Firesteap Citadel with the prostitute Nyla at the time and he was caught by Lieutenant Ptolnec who threatened to discipline him. However, embarrassingly for Ptolnec, the captain of the guard came out of the tent as Ptolnec was threatening Pristoleph for running this brothel, and the captain then ordered Ptolnec to go in the tent after him to take his own turn and pay the lady for her services.</p>
<p>Afterward, he did not advance very much in his service in the city guard. In the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , he had the rank of captain. At the time, the city was engaged in a project for the reconstruction of the city walls and had invited a Cormyrean engineer named Willem Korvan for the project. Ptolnec noticed Willem making errors in his calculations and ordered him to do them again. Willem then got the master-builder Inthelph to use his influence with other senators of Innarlith to have Ptolnec removed to a faraway post in the mountains.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>It was rumored that he was very unhappy about inheriting his family's fortune very late and being unable to advance to the rank of senator in the city-state.</p>
