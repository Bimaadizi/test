<p>A stone defender was a type of clockwork construct developed by gnomish tinkerers to serve as protectors and bodyguards.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As its name suggested, the stone defender had massive stone slabs affixed to its form to serve as shields. Beyond defense, these slabs aided to a form of camouflage. When the defender stood against a stone or rocky surface, it became imperceptible from its surroundings.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Only magical weapons or those forged from adamantine could damage a stone defender. Similarly, magical spells were often less effective when cast against the clockwork construct.</p>
<p>Like other constructs, a stone defender did not have to breathe air, eat food, or sleep for rest.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>The stone defender's large stone shields were useful both offensively and defensively in combat. It could slam them into foes, or use them to protect nearby allies from attacks.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The high priests of the Tenebrous Creed deployed at a pair of stone defenders to watch over their operations in the Thunder Peaks in the late 15 th century DR . Their defenders had shields constructed from a green, glass-like stone.</p>
