<p>Arazium was a solar celestial from the world of Oerth and one of the opponents of the hero-turned death knight - Scaldulin .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sages of Toril knew about some of Scaldulin's feats and heroics on a distant world of Greyhawk, including the hero's fall and transformation into a death knight. In the process of his fall from grace, Scaldulin slew Arazium using his enchanted sword that was especially effective against planar opponents. Eventually, the Hoarfrost Blade left the death knight's hands and ended on on the world of Toril .</p>
