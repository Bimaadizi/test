He was the founder of a Council of Mages that became the War Wizards during the reign of Rhiiman Obarskyr the Glorious , circa the Year of the Mournful Dance, 70 DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>

<p>Another descendant of Baerauble and Alea was Amedahast . She took over the position of Mage Royal after Baerauble's death. The High Wizard Vangerdahast was also a descendant of Baerauble.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Baerauble was born in the Year of Lost Messengers, −116 DR .</p>
<p>In the Year of Leather Shields, −75 DR , Baerauble was captured and imprisoned by a band of humans in the forest of Cormanthor , until rescued by Alea Dahast and a group of elven hunters. He would later become Alea's lover. When Ondeth Obarskyr and his settlers arrived on the land that would later become Suzail in the Year of the Firestars, 6 DR , Baerauble introduced himself and became a kind of intermediary between the humans and elves. By the Year of Distant Thunder, 16 DR , there was some feeling within the elven community that he had become a puppet for the humans.</p>
<p>When the kingdom of Cormyr was founded in the Year of Opening Doors, 26 DR , Iliphar Nelnueve appointed Baerauble as advisor to the first king, Faerlthann Obarskyr, despite Baerauble's disapproval on the grounds that he wanted to remain with Alea and their children.</p>
<p>During the reign of Boldovar Obarskyr , Baerauble used his magic to partially control the madness of the king. He also foiled five plots against the regent.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Dun Dragon, 245 DR , Baerauble had become known as "Baerauble the Venerable" in his position as High Wizard of Cormyr. At this time, his beard had only a small number of red streaks left, and his hairline had gone back to his crown. He still wore the old-style elven green linens.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Leaping Hare, 376 DR , Baerauble was very thin and frail, with a bald head. He had a few white strands of hair where his beard and eyebrows had been. He required a staff to walk anywhere and had to be carried in a chair over longer distances. He finally died in the Year of the Cat's Eye, 429 DR .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>It was said that Baerauble's long life was owed to the elves who gave him potions of longevity .</p>
