<p>Oryne Belamadin was an Amaunatori priestess in Cormyr during the mid-1480s DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Oryne had light skin and golden hair in twin braids.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Sschindylryn invasion , Oryne aided the defenders of Eveningstar . She used spies and divination to learn about the masters of the invasion, House Szind , and discovered that they were on the verge of a necromantic revolution—powerful, intelligent undead that lost none of their living faculties and were entirely loyal to their creators. She quickly organized a strike team to eliminate this threat in particular and weaken Szind and the drow more generally, eschewing all subtlety in favor of simply destroying everything while using drow-seeming illusory disguises to implicate rival houses. She instructed them to use captured flashstones to destroy the special necromantic cauldrons while eliminating the house's necromancers and extant undead.</p>
<p>The Cormyrean team managed to fulfil the objectives, wrecking the estate and eliminating the lead necromancer Relig , and possibly slaying Matron Zhivsha Szind . In the end it may have merely been Relig's overly-grandiose pronouncements that drew Oryne's notice in the first place, with the ultimate undead being nothing more than a phantom menace.</p>
