<p>The South Road was an old, important road built in Amn that connected much of its frontiers.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The length and remoteness of the road made it very difficult to upkeep. It was effectively a muddy, rutted trail that picked its way through the often rough and hilly terrain of Amn's lightly-populated hinterlands.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The South Road ran around the distant eastern and southern borders of Amn, curving hundreds of miles from Eshpurta , through the Tejarn Hills , and around to Eshpurta . The section of road between Eshpurta and Trollford was known as the Troll Road, and it was standard for travelers and caravans to receive an escort by the garrison at Eshpurta along this stretch.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The South Road was built during the Third Age of Calimshan ( −1900 DR to −900 DR ) to link its distant northern garrisons and outposts across the Ralamnish Ridings , such as the Nine Sentinels . Earlier on, the South Road forked south from the Tejarn Hills into Tethyr to provide a fast direct route from Shoonach , though this section of road disappeared with time.</p>
<p>The road continued to be used through the 14 th century by merchants and the Council Army , passing through the fallen realms of Meiritin and Cortryn that were absorbed into Amn.</p>
