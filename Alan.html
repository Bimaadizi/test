<p>Alans were avian humanoids found in Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Alans looked like small humans but had the wings of a bird instead of arms. They had short fingers on their wingtips and their toes were long and flexible, allowing them to grasp and manipulate objects with their feet. Each toe was tipped with a sharp claw.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Alans avoided melee combat if possible. They used their flying abilities to make quick attacks and then retreat before an opponent could strike back. Their preferred tactic when dealing with an enemy was to ambush them from above. They did this by grasping a tree branch with their feet and hung upside down, waiting for a target to pass underneath. They then dropped down and quickly attacked using a spear or the sharp claws of their feet. Alans were capable of using a spear while in flight.</p>
<h2>Personalty</h2>
<p>Alans were cunning, mischievous and resourceful. They were known to use their cunning and intelligence to plan elaborate pranks on others.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>While they lived away from human settlements and had little contact with them, alans maintained a relatively friendly relationship with the humans of Kara-Tur. Alans were territorial and guards were stationed around their tree-top villages to ward off trespassers.</p>
<h2>Habitat</h2>
<p>Alans lived within tropical forests, with their villages in the branches of large trees. Their homes were small but elegant, and clustered in groups of three to five tree-houses per tree.</p>
