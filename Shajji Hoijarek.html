<p>Shajji Hoijarek was a human barbarian of the Tsu-tsu tribe of the Plain of Horses in the late 13 th and 14 th centuries DR . A former lama , he later became the qaghan or leader of the tribe and the city of Jugicha .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hoijarek was originally a lama at the temples in Jugicha. However, at the age of 50, he left his temple to serve as apa qaghan under his brother, Shajji Ghoiji , who at the time ruled the Tsu-tsu as qaghan .</p>
<p>However, Ghoiji's government was corrupt and fell into chaos and finally rebellion circa Shou Year 2587 (1337 DR) . Thus Hoijarek stepped in, gathering capable advisors to his side and ascending as the new qaghan .</p>
<p>For the next 20 years, Hoijarek ruled well and worked to reestablish order in Jugicha and revive Tsu-tsu prosperity. Yet he also conquered a number of lesser neighboring tribes by slaying their livestock and poisoning their water supplies to force them to submit to the Tsu-tsu. He opposed the Fankiang tribe and the rulers of Li-Raz as a means of uniting his people. However, during a raid, the Fankiang killed his wife and children. Hoijarek made a vow of vengeance, and all the Tsu-tsu swore with him.</p>
<p>Hoijarek remained in power, but knew he had only a few years remaining to witness the fall of the Fankiang before his old body succumbed to age.</p>
<p>In Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) , Hoijarek hatched a scheme to lure the Fankiang into a trap. He ordered forty camels be stained white, as white camels were held to be sacred by the Fankiang, and left to graze a day's ride west of Li-Raz, where they would inevitably be spotted by Fankiang scouts or herdsmen. Tsu-tsu horsemen then lay in wait to ambush any Fankiang who came to round up these apparently valuable beasts. Fankiang herdsmen sighted these possibly valuable camels and reported them to qaghan Chuqali Shilai , who dispatched soldiers and adventurers to retrieve them. This ambush may have led to battle or all-out war between the two tribes.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As an old man of more than 70 years of age, Hoijarek had a hard time breathing and his body moved stiffly.</p>
