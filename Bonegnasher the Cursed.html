<h2>History</h2>
<p>Agarta the Breaker of the Night Brigade gang operated a series of arenas where beasts and prisoners were pitted against each other. Among the willing and unwilling gladiators was Bonegnasher and his band of orcs, formerly of the Storm Horns mountains. They were strong, capable fighters, but their time in the prison ended when the Riverside Rats gang sent a team into the prison to fight the Night Brigade, meeting and defeating Bonegnasher's group.</p>
