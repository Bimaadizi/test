<p>Thrym was a titan worshiped by the frost giants as the giant god of cold and ice. He was the de facto leader of the frost giants as well.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Thrym appeared as an exceptionally large frost giant. He typically wore chainmail and a coat made of white fur.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>When not directly preparing for war, Thrym was known to be fairly aloof, wandering his realm restlessly.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Thrym could breathe a devastating cone of cold out to 100 ft (30 m) and was completely immune to cold- or ice-based attacks. Only highly magical weapons could even touch him enough to injure him. He often granted frost giants the ability to use arcane magic like a wizard .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>His signature weapon was a large double-bladed greataxe .</p>
<h2>Realm</h2>
<p>Thrym ruled the realm of Fimbulwinter, with a stronghold and festhall known as Nyfholl. In the World Axis cosmology this was located in in the Elemental Chaos and described as a wide tundra illuminated by sparkling frozen waterfalls.</p>
<p>In the World Tree cosmology his domain was located in the plane of Jotunheim . It was said to be mountainous, but still filled with snow, ice, frost, and glaciers. He was said to roam the mountains and glaciers of this plane, rather than maintaining a permanent residence.</p>
<p>In the Great Wheel cosmology , instead of the domain of Fimbulwinter he co-ruled the entire plane of Jotunheim alongside his brother Surtur . Much like the World Tree cosmology, he was said to wander the plane with a company of giant jarls.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point Thrym forged a magic warhammer by the name of Matalotok .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Thrym was a son of Annam All-Father .</p>
<p>Thrym was known to have a rivalry with his twin, Surtur. Since birth, the two had competed to be the first at everything.</p>
<p>At some point, Thrym fathered the frost giant Utgard-Loki , who would grow to become ruler of the city of Utgard in Jotunheim. Much later he fathered the Empyrean Nalkara with Auril , goddess of winter.</p>
