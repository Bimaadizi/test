<p>Xax Chung was a male hare hengeyokai bushi and the hero of the city of Koje in Koryo in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Xax was found wounded in the form of a hare by a wandering shukenja , who healed him. However, the shukenja also placed a geas on Xax, commanding that he must look after and protect the people of the city of Koje until Jisziat's Tower , a prominent local landmark, was "cast to the ground". Xax could not be free until this came about.</p>
<p>In the course of this duty, Xax saved Koje from a giant dragon turtle and slew the tengu Kwi'asp . For his efforts, he was feted as the "hero of Koje". He was also said to have "tamed" the witch Zartalla , whom he later married.</p>
<p>By 1357 DR , Xax and Zartalla had settled down and raised a family, but his geas remained unfulfilled.</p>
<p>Finally, many years later, when Xax was an old man, Koje was assaulted by a dragon , who tore down Jisziat's Tower. Xax battled the dragon, and died defending his adopted city. Revealed to be a hare hengeyokai at the end, he remained known as the hero of Koje.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>In the fulfillment of his geas , Xax had to maintain the pretense of being a human to the people of Koje, though he would prefer to get away into the woods to be with other hengeyokai. He never ate meat, a habit that was noticed but not questioned. Few suspected the truth until his death.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In human form, Xax was of medium build and had wide brown eyes as befitted a hare. He typically wore around his neck a brass chain bearing the symbol of the god of the warren , but its meaning was unknown or obscure to those who saw it.</p>
<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>Xax had reflexes that were lighting fast, lending him great skill at arms.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>Xax was married to Zartalla, and they had children.</p>
<h2>Residence</h2>
<p>Xax dwelled at a large cattle ranch about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) north of Koje, together with his family and servants.</p>
