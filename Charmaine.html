<p>Charmaine was the favorite servant of Szass Tam , the powerful lich and Zulkir of Necromancy of Thay , in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Charmaine was a thin and attractive middle-aged human woman. She was one of a few-dozen loyal servants of Szass Tam.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was polite, attentive, competent, and reliable, making her one of the lich's favorites as an attendant. She desired to grasp immortality with her master's help.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Charmaine served the lich in exchange for food and a promise of immortality instead of gold. Szass Tam fully intended to honor his promise as soon as he exhausted her youth, making her his loyal servant forever.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By 1362 DR , Charmaine had been loyally serving Szass Tam for three decades.</p>
<p>Around 1373 DR , she was supposed to be turned into a loyal vampire servant but to the unending wrath of the lich master, she mistakingly gave herself to a fledgling vampire who was not aware of her status with Szass Tam. Charmaine thought the vampire who fancied her was sent by the lich to grant her the reward, and she did not fight his advances. In bloodlust, the young vampire drained the attendant, killing her. Furious, the lich incinerated the vampire with a mere thought. It was too late to raise her as a vampire, and Szass Tam hated the idea of raising her as a zombie or a ghoul and hated the idea of losing such a loyal servant. In the end, he decided to let her rest in peace.</p>
