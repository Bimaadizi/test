<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1360 DR , the Black Rat tavern in Suzail was visited by King Azoun Obarskyr IV disguised as an elderly commoner. During the tumultuous time directly preceding the Crusade against the Tuigan Horde, the King was there to see the reaction of his subjects to the announced war. There, he met Ambrosius , a paladin who was able to see through the disguise, thinking Azoun to be one of the king's spies. During that evening, Ambrosius informed the discussed king that many Cormyrians signed up to be part of the army, the paladin himself included. During that time the tavern was frequented by the members of the Trappers' Guild the organization actively opposing the Tuigan Wars as well as attempted assassination of King Azoun the same year.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Between 1360 DR and 1362 DR , and likely much longer, the Rat employed one barmaid who lived in the tavern. She was a jolly and frumpy red-headed woman. The owner of the Rat in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR could often be found sweating in the kitchen. He was a large intimidating man with long wavy black hair. His hairy chest was covered by a grease-stained apron. He defended his tavern fiercely, not hesitating to use his hefty meat cleaver . The owner of the Rat did not tolerate individuals scaring his customers away.</p>
