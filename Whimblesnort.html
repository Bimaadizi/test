<p>Mayor Whimblesnort , was a gnome who lived in Purfbin Doogrick 's home burrow in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mayor Whimblesnort was in attendance at her burrow's annual New Harvest Festival sometime before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . However, that year's event turned disastrous with the help of aspiring inventor Purfbin Doogrick. The Chief Cook Bitty Bitterbreath was convinced to let Purfbin present his latest and greatest invention, the Shred-o-Matic 1000 , to the adoring crowd of the burrow's important guests. The young gnome lost control of the apparatus, and instead of shredding a mountain of potatoes for the famed Harvest Stew , it moved to shred guests. Mayor Whimblesnort's new silk hat was the first casualty of the rampage.</p>
