<p>Huntcrown was a noble house of Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>Their seat was the Huntcrown Estate in Suzail .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the abraxus affair in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the family was apparently among those that favored a ruling council for Cormyr rather than any regency or continued Obarskyr rule.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Circa 1479 DR , the family had diverse holdings all over Cormyr and thus often was the best informed of the nation's goings-on. The family was known for spreading gossip and rumors and was at the center of the greatest number of scandals of any noble family.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>The family's greatest adversary was once the Cormaeril family, whose members jealously guarded their privacy. However, after the Cormaerils were exiled after the abraxus affair, the Huntcrowns developed a rivalry with Houses Emmarask , Illance and Marliir .</p>
