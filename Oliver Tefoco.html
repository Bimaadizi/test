<p>Oliver Tefoco was the proprietor of Beehive Goods and Wares general store in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, Oliver appeared to be a middle-aged human man with a light skin tone and a wild head of curly dark brown hair and bushy mutton-chops. He had brown eyes and wore a monocle over his left eye. He was known for his tasty home cooking.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He had a spouse, Kroyce Tefoco , and a large family. Their two youngest children, Hemjax and Maggie , lived with them above the shop. His oldest child, Bubbles Tefoco , lived in the Stonyeyes district of the city with her family and the newborn Dorimara , while Crowell and Thegglis traveled with merchant caravans along the Sword Coast North , and Dariel Tefoco served as a Flaming Fist mercenary. Oliver's kids, Blunce Tetoco and Harvel Tefoco were amongst the most recently approved applicants to join the Flaming Fist in 1492 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , as the Cult of the Absolute threatened the Gate's safety, Oliver's family were forced to leave the city for their own safety, traveling to Kroyce's family in Beregost . Kroyce asked Oliver to close the store and join the family in Beregost, in Uncle Sternwell 's shed, but Oliver refused. All through the Absolute crisis , Beehive remained abuzz but Oliver struggled to make ends meet. During that time, Nortale's Hostel , a shelter for refugees, asked Oliver for any supplies he would be willing to donate. In turn, Beehive Goods and Wares's own supplier, Durinbold & Oathoon , Provisioners, suspended deliveries of food and dry goods until trade caravans could enter the Gate.</p>
