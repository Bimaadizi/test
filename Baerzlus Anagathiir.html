<p>Baerzlus Anagathiir was the only Red Wizard of Thay to become a Magister . He was known for one of the shortest reigns ever.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The young Baerzlus believed that becoming Magister would grant him power among his peers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 952 DR , Baerzlus, thanks to some luck, managed to kill the hedonistic Magister Ildathchance Orlaer after discovering his refuge.</p>
<p>However, instead of the respect that he believed he would receive from his fellows, Baerzlus was welcomed with hostility by all Red Wizards. After one mage sent his slaves to kill him, Baerzlus fled from Thay . After that, he spied upon his fellows from afar and desired only to assassinate them. Baerzlus started killing one Red Wizard after another, all chosen from among his old foes and superiors.</p>
<p>At last, an army of Red Wizards attacked Baerzlus, all with the intent of personally killing him and claiming the Magister's position. This started one of the most terrific spell-battles ever, even creating a place of wild magic . Baerzlus was totally disintegrated like most of his attackers and Mystra and Azuth were so disgusted by the devastation and the loss of lives that they decided to search in another place for the next Magister.</p>
