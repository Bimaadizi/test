<p>Zrumya was a giant bat who worked in the general store that belonged to Ibn Engaruka of Port Castigliar , in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Zrumya was a well-trained giant bat about the size of an adult human . The bat could understand instructions given to it by Inyanga. Zrumya moved and carried the store's boxed goods using the claws located on its wing joints. The dire bat had a bundle strapped to its chest to move goods around the shelves and hard-to-access storage places to help with its duties. Zrumya's skittering on the store floor and high walls of boxes reminded observers of a moving spider . When not working, Zrumya could be found on its perch inside the general store.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Zrumya was a loyal guardian of the young shopkeeper's son, Inyanga Engaruka, helping the child maintain the store, and defended him fearlessly if Inyanga was ever threatened.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1362 DR , Artus Cimber and Hydel Pontifax encountered Zrumya and its young master Inyanga Engaruka when they traveled to Chult in search of the fabled Ring of Winter .</p>
