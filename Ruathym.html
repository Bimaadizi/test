<p>Ruathym ( pronounced : /ˈ r uː ə θ ɪ m / ROO-uh-thim ) was an island in the Trackless Sea and one of the larger islands north of the Moonshae Isles . It was the homeland of the Northlander peoples.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Ruathym was located more than 200 miles (320 kilometers) north of the Moonshae Isles, and was sometimes considered by the Northlanders to be nominally a part of that archipelago.</p>
<p>It was a rocky island with rugged coasts dotted with narrow coves, fjords, and inlets. The island itself was largely barren but with green hills and forested purple mountains. A few villages and steadings that clung to the coastline. It was a generally inhospitable place.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>The people of Ruathym were known to be savage and violent, even compared to other Northlanders. As the first of the Northlanders, they were said to believe that it was their birthright to be regarded as the rulers of all other Northlanders. They respected the driving winds and waves of the sea, and historically venerated warriors and the battles they waged. By the late 15 th century DR , with many of their longtime rivals diminished following the Spellplague , the island's long traditions of raiding had faded, and island was relatively peaceful. Even so, outsiders were cautioned that the island could rally for war at a moment's notice: the people of Ruathym remained savage and warlike, but mainly focused their aggression on each other, with wars between petty rulers invariably erupting every few years.</p>
<p>The dead were cremated in large funeral bonfires that escorted them on their way to the Halls of Tempus .</p>
<h3>Language</h3>
<p>The people here spoke Ruathen, which was a dialect of Illuskan , although most spoke Common . Dock-alfar meant dark elf. Hamfriggan (literally "shapestrong") referred to the shapeshifters of Ruathym.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early History</h3>
<p>Some time around −4600 DR , the Sailors of the Mountainous Waves , the navy of the dwarf realm of Haunghdannar , built a stone fortress they named Sonnmorndin on the island, which was originally called Arauwurbarak .</p>
<p>The first humans to settle the island arrived circa −3100 DR , having sailed there from somewhere to the west. By −3000 DR , they would found Illusk on the Sword Coast North , and by −1000 DR , they would begin colonizing the many islands of the Sea of Swords , including the Gull Rocks , Gundarlun , Mintarn , the Purple Rocks , the Teeth , Tuern , Umukek , the Wave Rocks , and the Whalebones . They avoided the Moonshae Isles at this time, believing them to be cursed by the fey that dwelt there.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Reluctant Hero, 95 DR , Uthgar Gardolfsson led his Ruathen reavers in a raid on Illusk. They sacked the city, but the future deity was ultimately driven back by the angry townsfolk.</p>
<p>In the Year of Azure Blood, 1126 DR , the Tome of the Unicorn was reported to be in the possession of the monarchy of Ruathym. It was stored in the Green Rooms.</p>
<h3>Modern History</h3>
<p>The Tome of the Unicorn was stolen by a Calishite mage called Shond Tharovin in the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR . Ignorant of the true culprit, the last foreign ship to leave the island— Telgontan Horn , a caravel from Luskan —was attacked and sunk. In response, Luskan declared war on Ruathym. The Luskanites destroyed Ruathym's fleet and landed troops on the island. With help from the Holgerstead tribe, First Axe Ulphron Lithyl 's forces managed to drive the Luskanites back into the sea after a few months of warfare.</p>
<p>However, Luskan attacked again the following year. This time they were much more successful, managing to conquer the entire realm save for scattered pockets of resistance. In Uktar of the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Aumark Lithyl , Ulphron's son and a member of the famous Knights of Myth Drannor , returned home. After his father died in battle just before the winter storms set in, he managed to unite the four tribes of Ruathym under his banner.</p>
<p>In Kythorn of the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , the Lords' Alliance threatened war against both sides unless they came to an accord. Realizing that Luskan and the Northlander island realms had more in common than any other coastal city, Ruathym, Luskan, the Whalebones , and Tuern declared an alliance called the Captain's Confederation (also known as the Captains' Alliance ) the following summer and began raiding shipping and coastal settlements up and down the Sword Coast in concert.</p>
<p>During the Time of Troubles that year, avatars of Labelas Enoreth and Clangeddin Silverbeard battled on Ruathym. After the destructive battle, plantmen appeared in the streets, attacking residents and the crew of the Realms Master . Although the crew managed to escape thanks to the intervention of Labelas, many of the island's inhabitants died to the creatures' onslaught.</p>
<p>In the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR , the Captain's Confederation was dissolved when Luskan attempted to conquer Ruathym a second time. Luskan, with the help of the Kraken Society , began a conspiracy (mainly involving pickled sea elves placed in Ruathen casks ) intended to provoke Waterdeep and the Lords' Alliance against Ruathym, but the conspiracy was discovered by Liriel Baenre . The attacking Luskan navy, led by High Captain Rethnor , and a merrow army led by Vestress of the Kraken Society, was defeated by the Ruathen with her help. The mind flayer Vestress , self-proclaimed Regent of Ascarle , sent a merrow army against Ruathym but the Northmen managed to repel them. Threatened with war by Waterdeep, Luskan withdrew its forces.</p>
<p>A third war was instigated between Luskan and Ruathym when Black Garius sent men to steal the Tome of Iltkazar from the Green Rooms in 1374 DR .</p>
<p>By the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Luskan had largely collapsed, and the loss of this old enemy led to a relaxing of Ruathym's more warlike posturing. At the same time, they policed their ports more stridently, going so far as to turn away ships from the Moonshaes in order to avoid the many troubles that were plaguing that archipelago at the time. It was at this time that the Storm Maiden began to rally the people of Ruathym, who believed that she could lead them to a golden age of conquest.</p>
