<p>Jedd was the Captain of the barge called The Topside that traveled the Fire River in the Vast in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>By that time, Jedd was an aged man whose rugged appearance was the telltale sign of many years of travel and an outdoorsman's life. Despite that, he was a pleasant and charismatic man whose presence possessed a comforting quality. A spark in his mind and aged articulation indicated Jedd being a smart man.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After a long and strenuous career as an adventurer and a caravan guard and witnessing plenty of death, Jedd settled down in the Vast and took on the calm profession of a barge captain. He greatly preferred the comforting life of a captain and the river's solitude to the struggle of being a mercenary. Despite being slowed and relaxed, Jedd was still ready for unexpected dangers and kept a cutlass and a dagger stashed inside his bedroll .</p>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR, Jedd's barge, The Topside , had a crew of nine. At all times, three of them ensured the barge stayed on course while the rest focused on other tasks or took breaks. Circa the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Captain Jedd was hired by Shauna Morden , the proprietor of the Tavern of the Garden , to transport a band of adventurers from the city of Ravens Bluff to the village of Dragon Falls . Along the several-days-long journey, Jedd entertained his passengers by telling them the story of the red dragon Firewings and the group of heroes who slew the beast, giving the name to the village of Dragon Falls.</p>
