<p>Prince Aglarel Tanthul was one of the twelve original Princes of Shade , the sons of Telamont Tanthul that came to Faerûn on the eve of the Return in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Aglarel was said to have been as large as a bugbear with dark, shadowy skin and eyes that gleamed like gems .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He had no interest in attaining more personal power and did not abide political maneuvering and games.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>After the city of Thultanthar returned to the skies over Anauroch , Aglarel took command over his father's personal bodyguard, believing that he would undoubtedly be the target of an assassination attempt. Over time, Telamont Tanthul tasked Aglarel with seeking out humans across the Realms whose lineage claims distinct Netherese ancestry. The younger prince then arranged for these individuals to be abducted to Thultanthar for close examination and eventual induction among the shades if they proved "worthy".</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The prince's personal sigil was the profile of a steel blue, riveted great helm set on a field of orange.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was entirely loyal to his father Telamont Tanthul above all others.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Aglarel and his brothers returned to Faerûn in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , he traveled along with Clariburnus and Escanor to the Marsh of Chelimber to slay phaerimm . There they encountered Lady Laeral Silverhand of Waterdeep and began to forge an alliance against their ancestral foes from beyond the Sharn Wall .</p>
<p>In 1487 DR during the conflict against Myth Drannor Larloch shattered the minds of Aglarel and of many of Shade 's finest arcanists.</p>
