<p>By the mid-14 th century DR, Thamalon's love for winemaking paid off. He created Storm Ruby , Usk Fine Old, and Thamalon's Own wines. In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Thamalon Uskevren sought to trade with Nuldrevyn Talendar of House Talendar , discussing a deal to ship Usk Fine Old and other Uskevren wines to Southern Amn , Tethyr , Calimshan , along with other Sembian trade goods. After tasting Storm Ruby, Nuldrevyn Talendar appreciated its excellent taste. Usk Fine Old was sold as far from Sembia as the Land of the Lions as early as the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR .</p>
