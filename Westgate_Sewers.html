<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>A large portion of these sewers were regularly in a flooded state. They were unlit, requiring a torch to traverse, and thick with the stench of decay.</p>
<h3>Functionality</h3>
<p>As Westgate was built around a natural harbor on the southern coast of the Inner Sea , at the mouth of the River Thunn , the city's sewers emptied into there. The sewers fouled the water of the harbor, making those who swam in it likely to catch a disease .</p>
<h3>Sewer Ecology</h3>
<p>A variety of terrible aquatic monsters were said to lair within these sewers. The most notable of them was a great quelzarn , which was known to occasionally snatch sailors from off the decks of ships moored in Westgate's harbor. This was such common knowledge among Westhavians, that bouncers of the Black Eye throwing combatants into the harbor was referred to as "feeding the quelzarn."</p>
