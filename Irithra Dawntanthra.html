<p>Irithra Dawntanthra was the Magister from 612 DR to 641 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Irithra Dawntanthra was quiet and solemn.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>She was able to use her spells in unexpected, and inventive ways, because of her thorough understanding of them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally born on an islet near Alaron in the Moonshaes , Irithra was the daughter of Calagrace , a sorceress from Calimshan who was fleeing an arranged marriage. She spent much time farscrying the mainland; Irithra grew up fascinated by the working of magic. After her mother died of a winter fever , Irithra continued to improve her own skills and experiences, looking for new insights. She also continued to devise new spells of her own, being the original creator of the spelltouch .</p>
<p>She accepted the office of the Magister when Azuth offered it, and inquired, on her knees, how to best serve. After his answer, she tirelessly began to travel the Realms, sharing spells, advice, and even new spellbooks to all who appeared to need them. She neglected established mages, which earned her the enmity of many, and numerous challengers near the end of her reign. She defeated many mages who overpowered her through her superior grasp of tactics and preparation; her last duel, however, took place in a white dragon 's lair. She won, but roused the wyrm; after slaying it, she nearly flew into Dathchaunt Sandrach , who was on his way to slay the dragon. She attacked him desperately, and when he returned the attack, he slew the weakened Magister.</p>
