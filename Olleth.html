<p>Throughout the Age of Humanity , the Arcanum of Olleth was the major morkoth country in Serôs . Early into the Era of Upheaval and after the Spellplague , Olleth became ruled by kuo-toa .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Olleth was founded in 911 DR .</p>
<p>Sometime late in the 14th century of Dale Reckoning the morkoth ambushed a kuo-toa delegation under a truce vouchsafed by Blibdoolpoolp . Half of the kuo-toa were eaten and the rest were kept as slaves. However, several of the surviving kuo-toa were whips of Blibdoolpoolp and started a massive campaign of setbacks, uprisings and disasters.</p>
<p>In 1385 DR the Spellplague struck Olleth and a third of the morkoth mages dissolved in blue flashes. The remaining morkoth lost their grip on the spells they used to enslave others. The kuo-toa moved quickly to seize control of Olleth. Most of the morkoth were killed, though a few escaped and the kuo-toa kept most of the slaves. Afterwards kuo-toa migrated into Serôs for the first time.</p>
<p>In 1393 DR several kuo-toa left Olleth and founded the colony of Taunissik</p>
<p>By 1479 DR , the city of Olleth was under the total dominion of the Abolethic Sovereignty .</p>
