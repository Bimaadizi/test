<p>Don Vaez was an adventurer who led Amn 's second expedition to Maztica .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Vaez was from Calimshan and apprenticed with a thieves guild but was not a very good rogue . He later moved to Amn and became a mercenary.</p>
<p>Cordell 's expedition had maintained some communication with Amn through Bishop Domincus ' magic. The Council of Six became concerned when communication ceased after the bishop's death although the Council was not aware of the reason for the cessation of communication.</p>
<p>Vaez used the influence of a powerful noblewoman to gain a commission as leader of the second expedition. He set sail for Maztica in 1362 DR with a fleet of 25 carracks , 1,500 soldiers, and two dozen minor mages . After arriving at Helmsport , Vaez imprisoned the troops Cordell had left at the fort and set about trying to find the gold Cordell had buried somewhere in the area.</p>
<p>Several months after Don Vaez arrived at Helmsport, Cordell returned with a small force. Vaez had Cordell and his men imprisoned and attempted to persuade Cordell to reveal the location of the buried gold. Shortly thereafter, Halloran arrived at the fort with a large contingent of soldiers. At the sight of the large number of soldiers outside the fort, Vaez's troops changed sides and Cordell had him arrested.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Don Vaez was described as handsome with silver-blond hair.</p>
