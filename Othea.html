<p>Othea (known as Deronain in Auld Dwarvish and Sonnhild in ancient Thorass ) was a goddess who married Annam All-Father and bore his children, who would become the origin of the giant race. She would later claim the cold vast plains with her son Lanaxis .</p>
<h2>Relatives</h2>
<p>Othea was the wife of Annam All-Father . Her sons were Lanaxis , Arno and Julian , Masud , Nicias , Obadai , Ottar , Ruk , Vilmos, and Dunmore ; the last, while initially believed Annam's son, was later thought to be the product of Othea's affair with the sea god Ulutiu . She also gave birth to at least five unnamed sons from affairs outside her marriage to Annam that resulted in the ogre races and the four giant-kin races.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Othea was unfaithful to Annam , her husband. Circa −26,000 DR , she had an affair with Vaprak , resulting in the ogre race, and then c. −25,500 DR she had an affair with Ulutiu , shortly before the end of the giant war against the dragons , resulting in four sons, (one of them Dunmore ): firbolg , fomorian , verbeeg , and voadkyn . Annam slew Ulutiu and hurled him into the Cold Sea . Othea was so upset by this that she refused to give Annam another child, but Annam tricked her to get her pregnant. They reached a compromise where Annam agreed to leave Abeir-Toril until the child called for him; in return Othea would not terminate the pregnancy.</p>
<p>Othea was poisoned by her son, Lanaxis , when she refused to let him save his citadel of Voninheim . Before she died, she cursed him, causing him to flee to Arborea . Her unborn son Hartkiller managed to survive.</p>
