<p>Vankila Slab was an aerial prison that soared over the realm of Muranndin , and remained there as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The prison comprised four circular towers that were built atop a floating earthmote , atop which sat a stone fortification known as the 'Sky Tomb'. The stretch of open area at the base of the tower, where prisoners were forced to work, was known as 'the Turf'.</p>
<h2>Activity</h2>
<p>For some time, Vankila Slab was home to an individual known as the Practitioner , a powerful mage who conducted horrific experiments on its prisoners.</p>
<p>The ogre guardsmen regularly patrolled the edges of Vankila Slab's mote, to prevent prisoners from jumping off the edge to their freedom.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Vankila Slab was originally built by the Houses of Amn , to imprison spellcasters that defied Amnish law that prohibited the unregulated use of magic. Within a decade however, it became controlled by a single organization that held power throughout Amn and Tethyr , and was repurposed as a general prison for the realm's most heinous criminals. After the discovery of valuable gems within the prison's earthmote, those criminals were put to hard labor as miners.</p>
<p>By the 1470s DR , the prison became more of a twisted laboratory-prison, a place where the Practitioner and their colleagues could conduct their twisted arcane experiments.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>It was said that Vankila Slab was a site of such brutality that even birds dared not fly too close to its edge.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Most prisoners of Vankila Slab were non- human , extremely violent criminals.</p>
