<p>Hagen Silverthumb was a dwarven member of Hal Stoutheart 's Tethyamar expedition during the 1480s DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hagen had a bald head and a trimmed white beard and moustache. He carried a pickaxe and small hammer .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the expedition, Hagen worked in Tethyamar Mineshaft 214S with other miners as they searched for the jewels of ardor. The foreman Egil Hakon suddenly went mad and began attacking his comrades, slaying all of his team except for Hagen. The shaken and terrified dwarf escaped back to the Tethyamar Mining Outpost to warn the others, and found hirelings from Cormyr ready to help. He sent them down into the mines to slay Egil, who had hidden himself at the bottom of the mine among his victims.</p>
<p>On their victorious return, Hagen was engrossed in conversation with a hallucinated companion. Whether by his trauma or Graz'zt 's influence, he was quite unmoored from reality.</p>
