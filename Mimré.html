<p>Lady Mimré of Procalith was one of the members of the Council of Lords and Ladies assembled from the mages of the city by the order of Sabral Faryre during his brief tenure as Magister in 298 DR . After his dead body was discovered in the throne, she attempted to claim the mantle of the Magister by burning his body with a spell; she did not acquire the office. She went missing, as did the throne, that same night; her body was not found until twenty years later.</p>
