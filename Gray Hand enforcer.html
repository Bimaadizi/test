<p>Gray Hand enforcers were highly-trained elite members of the Gray Hands , later referred to as Force Grey , the military strike force of Waterdeep . They upheld their reputation as fearless champions of the city with heroic fighting and fervent devotion to the City of Splendors.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Along with the other members of the Gray Hands, enforcers served directly under the Lords of Waterdeep . They were entrusted with the protection of their home city. Their unwavering loyalty was known all throughout the streets of Waterdeep.</p>
<p>These great fighters were famous for their heroic toughness and notorious for their gruff and informal demeanor. Enforcers did not have the patience to demonstrate any subtlety or mercy in battle.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Lords of Waterdeep only deployed the Gray Hands when the City Guard or City Watch could not handle a given threat. The enforcers reputation was such that they knew they never had to worry about the collateral damage they cause, so long as they annihilated the city's foes.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Like their comrades in arms, each of the Gray Hand's enforcers were given a small token with the symbol of their fighting group. This was a status symbol in Waterdeep, allowing them to act without impunity, save for intervention from a magistrate or civilar of the City Guard or City Watch, or the Masked Lords themselves.</p>
<p>The enforcers were granted the full resources of the famous Waterdhavian treasury. They were outfitted with enchanted weapons and armor by the Watchful Order , albeit at a personal cost of gold .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>While in the city, or up to 10 mi (16 km) away, Gray Hand enforcers were able to periodically infuse their attacks with power drawn from Alghairon's dragonward .</p>
<p>Over time, they developed an inherent resistance to magical spells.</p>
<p>The more experienced enforcers of the Gray Hands were granted a boon by the city's Lords, which allowed them to heal their own wounds.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>Gray Hand enforcers were chosen for their combat prowess, both in how they could eradicate their opponents and endure assaults while they protected others.</p>
