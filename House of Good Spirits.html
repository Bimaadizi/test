<p>The House of Good Spirits was the guildhall of the Waterdhavian guild known as the Vintners', Distillers', & Brewers' Guild .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The House of Good Spirits was located in the Southern Ward of Waterdeep . It stood on the northwest side of the Rising Ride , between the mouths of Juth Alley and Robin's Way , extending north and west along Tornsar Alley as far as Buckle Street . On that street one could find an alleyway leading to the back of the tavern, offering access to complex's inn and stables.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>This guildhall was roughly three-stories tall. It consisted of a complex of buildings, fronted by a timber tavern, with a central courtyard that separated the stables from the rest of the buildings. With the exception of the tavern, which was of a wattle-and-daub style, the buildings that made up the House of Good Spirits looked on the outside like factories and warehouses.</p>
<p>Hanging over the front door of the tavern was a huge sign bearing the mark of the guild and the name "House of Good Spirits." The wooden building housing the brewery smelled of yeast .</p>
<h3>Interior</h3>
<p>On the inside, the buildings that made up of the House of Good Spirits were directly joined and similarly had the look of a factory or warehouse to themâ€”large exposed beams and bare mud brick walls throughout. There were many small passages and nooks, odd doorways, and surprise steps. Furnishings in them were rather bare-bones and ordinary, yet comfortable.</p>
<p>The inn was comfortable, yet disorganized. Its central room sported a large fireplace. Most of the rooms within it had two single-person beds and lacked any luxuries. Within the long windows of the tavern hung purple and white curtains, embroidered with the guild's mark.</p>
<p>Some of the buildings had private meeting rooms that were available for conferences. One large building was dedicated to the storage of zzar , which gave it a distinctive almond scent.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Due to the nature of this hall's guild it operated as brewery, winery, inn, tavern, and wine store. They boasted one of the best and cheapest selections of a variety of liquors and strong drinks from across the Realms.</p>
<p>The inn portion of the House of Good Spirits offered a place to sleep for up to forty patrons, with rooms costing two gold pieces a bed per night. Those wanting a private room had to pay for both beds. Food and ale were covered by this flat rate, though wine and spirits cost extra. Stabling for draft beasts also costed an extra 1 copper piece each per night stayed.</p>
<h3>Provender</h3>
<p>In terms of food the inn had a rather basic menu. Serving patrons such things as roasted boar , rabbit -and-smalls stew (vegetables and various small game, such as fowls or squirrels ), and cheese -and- mustard saltbread melts (small, circular loaves of bread ).</p>
<p>The specialties of the House of Good Spirits were zzar and sluth , which were brewed on site. One could purchase sluth for two copper pieces a bottle, a lower rate than what was charged elsewhere, and six silver pieces for a bottle of zzar. Other beverages included Neverwinter black icewine for seven silver pieces, Best Old Mintarn whisky for one gold piece , Wyvern whiskey for two gold pieces, elverquisst , and blackthroat . With it notably being one of the few places in Waterdeep one could find elverquisst for sale.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 1300s DR , this complex began as a small brewery on the corner of the Rising Ride and Tornsar Alley. Soon after the tavern was opened for business. Some time in the early 1360's the Vintners', Distillers', & Brewers' Guild expanded the House of Spirits into an adjacent warehouse, which they repurposed as an inn for the convenience of visiting grape cultivators and wine merchants.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Many members of the Vintners', Distillers', & Brewers' Guild considered the House of Good Spirits to be a secondary home, staying at it whenever their own homes were overcrowded or being worked upon. During daylight hours, there was always a representative of the guild present for those wanting to deal in spirits.</p>
<p>The overall staff of the House of Good Spirits numbered forty individuals. Simon Thrithyn acted as the innkeeper in the 14 th century DR. Dlarna Suone and Gordrym Zhavall were the chief buyers and sellers for the guild. And there were seven burly bouncers, led by Mrorn Halduth .</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>The House of Good Spirits was among some of the more notable and recognizable inns in the Southern Ward, being considered a landmark.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>A widely spread rumor in Waterdeep was that the Flying Flagons , under sponsorship of the guild, slew a dragon and the large treasure hoard brought back remained hidden somewhere in or under the House of Good Spirits. Because of this rumor the staff had to warn visitors against digging or prying at the ceilings, floors, and walls.</p>
