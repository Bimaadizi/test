<p>The archdevils were powerful, unique devils . The most powerful archdevils were the Lords of the Nine .</p>
<h2>Hierarchy</h2>
<p>The position of archdevils in the hierarchy of Baator was clear: archdevils were the most powerful and were, therefore, on top. The most powerful of the archdevils were the archdukes, also called the Lords of the Nine . Other archdevils were dukes, ruling portions of a layer, generals, or bureaucrats of various sorts. Each used the unique qualities of their layer to keep its essential nature pure of chaos .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The presence of an archdevil twists and warps the layer over which they rule to be closer to what they themselves embody.</p>
<h2>Archdevils by Layer</h2>
<h3>Archdevils of Avernus</h3>
<h3>Archdevils of Dis</h3>
<h3>Archdevils of Minauros</h3>
<h3>Archdevils of Phlegethos</h3>
<h3>Archdevils of Stygia</h3>
<h3>Archdevils of Malbolge</h3>
<h3>Archdevils of Maladomini</h3>
<h3>Archdevils of Cania</h3>
<h3>Archdevils of Nessus</h3>
<h2>Other Archdevils</h2>
<p>Of course, due to the nature of politics in the Nine Hells, archdevils wound up exiled or dead at various times. Some exiles remained in the Nine Hells (such as Geryon and his court, listed above), while others were forced to leave completely.</p>
<p>Additionally, the dragon goddess Tiamat spent some time as an archdevil after her Untheric aspect was killed. She was ruler of Avernus during some of her time there. Another archduke that wasn't an archdevil was Malagard the Hag Countess, who ruled Malbolge before Glasya. She was actually a supremely powerful night hag , rather than a devil.</p>
<h3>Exiled Archdevils</h3>
<p>Some archdevils, former archdukes, were exiled or imprisoned, but survived. These included:</p>
<p>Other exiled archdevils included Armaros , Azazel , Bist , Cahor , Caim , Duskur , Jaqon , Kochbiel , Malarea , Nisroch , and Rumjal , all of whom lived as wandering outcasts in Avernus.</p>
