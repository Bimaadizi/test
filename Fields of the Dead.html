<p>The Fields of the Dead were the rolling hills east of Baldur's Gate between the Winding Water and the River Chionthar on the Sword Coast .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the mid–9 th century DR , before the founding of Amn , this land was a favored battleground for control of the lands north of Calimshan .</p>
<p>Kings Strohm IV and Samyte of Tethyr were buried here. In 1264 DR , thieves stole the Shield of Silvam and the Royal Masque Blades from the tombs.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Centuries after the fighting, by the mid–14 th century DR , bones still littered the field and cairns of the dead were everywhere. Now used for farming and ranching, plows occasionally turned up skeletons in rusting armor, weapons, and other detritus.</p>
