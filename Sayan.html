<p>Sayan was a city in Laothan in Malatra and the biggest seaport in the realm.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It was situated on Laothan's northern coast, on the shore of the Eastern Sea southeast of the Hanchi Shoals . A trail ran west along the coast to Thiam and another ran south through the jungle to Pursai .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The city was the home of the Nuyen , a powerful clan in Laothan. As of 1357 DR , it was ruled by Prince Nuyen Phi . The Nuyen and their allies and supporters together maintained the largest army in Laothan and dominated the north. Prince Nuyen Phi had also grown deaf to the edicts of the monarch of Laothan, Thok Lian , and even rebellious.</p>
<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>The port received a great deal of overseas trade from the northern realmd of Kara-Tur in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>A number of spies and assassins of Shou heritage from T'u Lung had established themselves in Sayan and worked for anyone with the coin to hire them. Prime among them was the Sung ninja clan. Thus, the city was rife with spies serving the Thok clan, rivals of the Nuyen. There were even a few spies serving Priest-King Vishnan VII of the Kuong Kingdom . In the eyes of some conservative Kuong , the city was "another center of decadence" in Laothan.</p>
