<p>Kerrenderit arrows were magical arrows made by arctic dwarves from kerrenderit crystals.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kerrenderit arrows were made with arrowheads carved from the namesake crystals, and required the imbuement of chill metal to be properly fashioned. The result of all this effort was a superior magical arrow that flew further and left grievous bleeding wounds, although it risked melting into nothing if exposed to temperatures above 50 ℉ (10 ℃ ) for more than an hour.</p>
