<p>Igaleus was one of the elven slaves captured by Chieftain Saslick 's lizardfolk in 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Igaleus was a large man. After capture, his lower jaw was striped with long red scars, reminiscent of trauma left by a spiked mace . The fresh and raw torn flesh attracted ravenous swamp flies .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the early fall of 1372 DR , Igaleus, along with his brothers, worked as a hunter in the vicinity of the Lizard Marsh . They hunted and foraged fresh meat for a huge orcish army led by a terrifying devil Gorgomorz . Igaleus harbored no goodwill towards the orcs or their Lower Planes master, but they paid for meat very well. Igaleus' hunters picked the lands clean and started diving into the Lizard Marsh, following herds of white-tailed deerâ€Ž . Eventually, the hunting party was ambushed by Saslick's lizardfolk, and Igaleus was snatched. He spent several weeks in captivity until the Hero of Daggerford infiltrated the lizard tribe while wearing the Green Hag's of Lizard Marsh polymorph . Igaleus promised to lead his fellow slaves away from danger, through the marsh, and to safety if he were given a key from the lizardfolk slave pen keeper, easy to spot by his size and a large wart on the snout. However, it was unknown if the Hero helped the slaves, angering the entire village of lizardfolk and their black dragon patron - Thuraskulusk .</p>
