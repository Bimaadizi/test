<p>The quarrak is a type of demon appearing in Dungeons & Dragons .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<h3>Personality and alignment</h3>
<p>Quarraks are reputed to spawn in pairs and, if one of the two dies, the other perishes as well in a matter of days. Regardless of this bond, the chaotic evil pair squabble incessantly and, if they are unable to find something else to fight and destroy, they inevitably attack each other. It is a love–hate relationship.</p>
<p>Quarraks are often underestimated by mortals and fellow demons because of their size and, as a result, have often overcome overconfident opponents. However, they lack any ambition, so they are often employed by the demon lords as shock troops—large numbers of them can quickly overrun an enemy force. Fear is the only means of controlling them, and the only things they fear are mightier demons. Rarely, evil mortal clerics or warlocks might make alliances with them, but these lasted only as long as the food supply did; if not, they would eat their former masters.</p>
<h2>Abilities and traits</h2>
<p>In a battle, quarraks are constantly on the move to stay close to their twin and work with them to assault their enemies from both sides. Quarraks are able to fight especially well when flanking their opponents with fellow quarraks and especially with their respective twins.</p>
<p>They attack by biting and are nimble and slippery opponents—if a foe attacks and misses, a quarrak can quickly move and bite again.</p>
<p>They cannot be slowed or immobilized by magic, and if harmed by fire, cold, lightning, or sound, they will be resistant to it for the rest of the fight or until they used this power again.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Environment</h3>
<p>They are found within the Abyss and speak Abyssal .</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>They are voracious and eat for pleasure and gluttony. They devour the dead after every battle, leaving little but broken weapons and armor.</p>
<h2>Society and culture</h2>
<h3>Organization</h3>
<p>Given their nature, they travel and fight in pairs, and in even-numbered groups.</p>
<h2>Notable quarraks</h2>
<p>Quarraks are among the many kinds of fiends that might be found imprisoned in an iron flask , such as the great Iron Flask of Tuerny the Merciless . When one is so trapped, the other is free to live its own life, though they still did not like too away from the flask .</p>
<p>Two such quarraks are Qiiv and Keev. After a greater demon trapped Keev in an iron flask , Qiiv was gleeful at being separated from his irritating twin, yet still stole the flask to keep Keev near. He eventually lost it in his carelessness, though, with no idea where. He set about searching for it and his twin. Qiiv led a small horde of quarraks who revered him as the "twinless chosen one".</p>
