<p>The Hands of Fury was a cruel and unpleasant adventuring band assembled by Makados , a Stormlord of Talos , active circa 1312 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Hands of Fury was assembled sometime before the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR by a proud, rowdy, and overbearing Talassan priest named Makados. Along with a bloodthirsty barbarian named Dahel Bloody-Four , Makados was on the group's frontlines, brutalizing and harassing anything and anyone the troupe encountered. Another warrior member of the group was Amraith , a dispossessed elven noble, a cold-natured and quick-minded man. Mirai Wainwright was the group's only wizard , a physically strong woman of equally strong will. The party's rogue was a dwarven outcast, Harbesh Carver , a thug for lack of a better description. Lastly, Fissera was a malicious druid who kept to the flank when in battle but was ready to unleash nature's wrath upon command.</p>
<p>In 1312 DR, The Hands of Fury traveled aboard a pirate ship to the city of Luskan , ending up stranded there after the further marine plans fell apart. Seeing no other opportunities for profit, the troupe answered a call for mercenaries coming from the far northern town of Targos , which was besieged by the Legion of the Chimera .</p>
