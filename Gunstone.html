<p>Gunstones were magical explosive weapons created in Mulhorand and were strong enough to stun and break through the shell of an adult dragon turtle .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gunstones were apple -sized perfect globes of silver . The surface was decorated with Mulhorandi picture-glyphs of winged men, hawk -headed humanoids , and women with feline features. These symbols flowed and moved along the perfect silver surface.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When thrown or launched at its target, a gunstone exploded in powerful flare and a thunderous rumble. The power of the explosion was enough to splinter stone and dragon turtle shell, magical and mundane.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1362 DR , Artus Cimber was in possession of an enchanted Mulhorandi amulet that bound a silver four-armed guardian to his service. During their journey to Chult , the ship was forced into a conflict with a dragon turtle named Aremag . Skuld , Artus' phantom, could summon gunstones and used their explosion to open the dragon turtle's shell, making it vulnerable to the crew's attacks.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Skuld's amulet fell into the cold blackstone hands of Kaverin Ebonhand . The villain used the phantom and his gunstones to lay siege to the ancient city of Mezro, along with the Batiri goblin forces of Queen M'bobo .</p>
