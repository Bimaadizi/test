<p>Ondil's Book of Spells was an enchanted book of Ondil 's making.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The book was large, enough to be lashed to one's stomach. It had a flexible metal band coming out of the ends of its binding, allowing it to shut itself closed.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The book was able to close and lock on its own. Not much more was known of its powers. It was assumed to be a spellbook, but this was false; it did, however, appear to repel flame.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Leaping Centaur, 232 DR , the Mad Mage of the Calishar , Ilhundyl , was visited by a priestess of Mystra , Elmara (secretly the prince Elminster Aumar of Athalantar ), asking how she could learn the most about sorcery. He bid her deliver Ondil's Book of Spells to the altar at Mystra's Dance .</p>
<p>She finally found the book in Ondil's Tower , guarded in a complex arrangement with a red dragon and a beholder , with two dreads watching over it.</p>
<p>Later, she surrendered it at Mystra's Dance as indicated, using a fake altar Ilhundyl had set up for that purpose. Ilhundyl had a lich take the book to his study, where, on forcing it open, he found it blank. He then consulted with the Magister , Dorgon Heamiiolothtar , who confirmed that the book was blank and he knew it, almost certainly implying he sought that book on the Magister's advice.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Ondil's Book of Spells was assumed to be a spellbook. This was ultimately proven false by Ilhundyl.</p>
