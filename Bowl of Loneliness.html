<p>The Bowl of Loneliness was a great dune field located in the Sword region of the Anauroch desert.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Bowl of Loneliness was an immense basin of white whaleback dunes, which looked like a stormy ice ocean from the distance. The sands there were pale as bones and the dunes towered as high as 500 feet (150 meters). Scaling one of those steep slopes with camels could take a whole day. The sandstorms made travel through the region very difficult: the sand from the dune crests swept like a flood across the troughs, engulfing travelers up to their heads.</p>
<p>Outside the Bowl, the yellow and white sand dunes grew smaller and more easily traversable. Their gradual slopes rose no more than 30 feet (9.1 meters) above ground level and were inset with pathways formed by the many people and camels that traversed the region.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Bowl of Loneliness was located on the far eastern stretch of the Sword, between the oases of El Rahalat and El Ma'ra .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , Zhentarim raiders ambushed the travelers Ruha , Kadumi , and Lander as they were traveling across the Bowl of Loneliness.</p>
