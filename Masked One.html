<p>The Masked One was a Red Wizard of Thay and a necromancer in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Masked One was a powerful wizard who tried to change the interests of the School of Necromancy from the destruction of Rashemen to other goals. However, this would draw him into conflict with Zulkir Szass Tam , so instead he hid himself in his castle to do research. He also staged an apparent disaster in his spell laboratory, which reportedly weakened him and left him disfigured, thus becoming "the Masked One".</p>
<p>In truth, he was plotting how to ruin Tam. He created a spell capable of dissolving a person and subsuming the powers of anyone his most secret spell could envelop. He killed some Red Wizards, becoming very powerful.</p>
<p>When, in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , the Time of Troubles started, the Masked One saw a unique chance to gain a god's power. So he began secretly hunting the avatar of Hoar , who was wandering Thay at the time. However, the overgod Ao sent Elminster to stop the Masked One. Elminster destroyed the Masked One on Kythorn 19 .</p>
