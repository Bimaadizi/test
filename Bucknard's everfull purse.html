<p>Bucknard's everfull purses were magic bags that filled themselves with coins every morning.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bucknard's everfull purses appeared to be nothing more than small mundane leather bags.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The bags came in three power varieties, each more powerful than the other, and it was reflected in their purchase price. Each bag was enchanted to duplicate a certain type of valuables or specific types of coinage: all multiplied electrum , and additionally either silver and gold , or copper and either platinum or ornamental stones , so long as their craftsmanship wasn't beyond exceptional. Bucknard's everfull purse was refilled with its specific type of coin, but if the bag was completely emptied and left unfilled for several minutes, the enchantments were gone forever. A single coin of a specific type could trigger the bag to refill overnight.</p>
