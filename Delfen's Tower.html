<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The outward facing arrow slits on the tower's walls were smaller that usual given that Delfen only needed to see a target to cast a spell at them. The inward facing walls of the tower had larger windows so that he could enjoy a view of the city.</p>
<p>Delfen's Tower was three stories tall. He used the top level as his personal quarters. The second level served as a classroom and dormitory for his students. The ground level was used to stable his mule and general supplies.</p>
