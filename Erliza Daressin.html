<p>Lady Erliza Daressin was a human woman and vampire who served as the Amnian ruler of the island of Snowdown in the Moonshae Isles throughout the 15 th century DR . She was known among many of her subjects as Bloody Erliza owing to her brutal suppression of dissidents.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She had pale, almost white skin. She kept her hair and clothes looking exquisite, and adorned herself in sparkling jewelry .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was always polite in her dealings. To those who were civil and useful to her, Lady Daressin perfectly played the part of a noblewoman and genuinely nice person, who served only the finest of foods to entertain her guests. To those who displeased her, she was a soft-spoken tyrant who had many swiftly executed. She had a friendly yet commanding tone of voice, and gave the impression of a powerful monarch. She was a consummate politician who always phrased her orders as requests, although they could not be mistaken for commands. She never answered a question unless it suited her, but her refusals to speak were always tactful.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Under her supervision, the island of Snowdown was stripped of its natural resources to make Amnian merchants rich, and they in turn made her rich. The Ffolk inhabitants over whom she ruled were overworked, and most despised her. She would profess to believing that she and the Amnian occupiers merely had an unfairly maligned reputation because of a few bad actors.</p>
<p>She had a great deal of influence not only on Snowdown but back in Amn. She maintained an extensive network of assassins , spies , informants, and shadow creatures to keep tabs on and to project her power into the broader Moonshae Isles.</p>
<p>She never revealed her true nature, even if attacked, unless absolutely necessary. She was accompanied by hidden guards to fend off attackers for her.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Only her closest confidants knew her vampiric nature, although none were privy to her deepest motivations. By the late 15 th century DR, some of her enemies had also discovered the truth about her undeath , and sought to use this secret to break her hold on Snowdown. She maintained a number of vampire servants on Snowdown.</p>
<p>She was much despised by the Kendrick High Kings and Queens of Callidyrr , and was known to use threats of violence against members of the Kendrick family to prevent them from acting against her. In the late 15 th century DR, she kidnapped the youngest son of High King Derid Kendrick , Prince Owaren , and used the boy as leverage against his father.</p>
<p>The fey of Sarifal were wary of her, and refused to meet with her envoys. They were known to mistake her as a queen of Snowdown.</p>
<p>A rakshasa known as The Fisherman endeavored to carve out a small kingdom for himself on Snowdown, naturally bringing him into conflict with Lady Daressin.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Erliza Daressin was bitten and turned into a vampire in Amn sometime prior to the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR . When she was transformed, she had a vision of being reborn as a queen of the Feywild . Through research that mostly consisted of consulting sages and then drinking their blood, she found information leading her to believe that the city of Karador contained a portal to the place in the Feywild that would allow her to fulfill this vision. Unfortunately, Karador was long submerged beneath the Myrloch on the island of Gwynneth at this time, and was inaccessible to her. Even after Karador fortuitously resurfaced in 1375 DR, she was stymied by the presence of the powerful fey who defended that city and would not let her trespass.</p>
<p>She would go on to become the first ruler of Amn's colony on Snowdown after its conquest in the Year of the Sceptered One, 1404 DR . By the late 15 th century DR, she worked to steer Amnian attention toward Gwynneth and the fey realm of Sarifal in the hopes of finally gaining access to Karador. She also considered cooperating with rivals of Sarifal's ruler, High Lady Ordalf , including the hag Urphania , Queen Connomae of the fomorians on Oman's Isle , and traitors from Ordalf's own court, such as Tiana . As of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , she had sent shadow creatures to capture the 8-year-old son of High King Derid, and kept the boy imprisoned in a tower in Caer Westphal .</p>
<p>While the Ffolk of Snowdown had long been mostly cooperative with their Amnian colonizers, by the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , she had been forced to suppress several uprisings, and the Kendricks continued to foster unrest on the island. By this time, she claimed to be her own great-granddaughter, the second of her name (and who happened to have a strikingly similar physical appearance), so as to continue ruling Snowdown without revealing her immortality.</p>
