<p>Gronag was a goblin warrior devotee of the Absolute who traversed the shadow-cursed lands during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gronag was a male goblin with facial pain across his left eye, dark-yellow hide, a mohawk, and crudely-cobbled together goblin metal armor and a scimitar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Gronag joined the new "deity" that emerged in the Western Heartlands â€“ the Absolute. The goblin joined the cult's army in the shadow-cursed lands around the Moonrise Towers and was tasked, along with a group of other cultists that included Kansif , Vez , and Bedi , with manning a checkpoint designed to help the cultists cross the deadly land. There, Gronag showed his cruel and sadistic traits by sending trained hyenas into the darkness after bones, where the hyenas were devoured by the curse.</p>
