<p>Bonnalurie was a sun elf and priestess of Angharradh in Tintageer . When her home was destroyed in a war, she was the last surviving priestess with enough power to control High Magic . On behalf of Durothil , she began to dance and sing to create a magical gate through the boundaries of the realms. In doing this, she helped fifty survivors and the prince to reach Faer√ªn , but she was consumed by the power of the magical forces she unleashed and was killed.</p>
