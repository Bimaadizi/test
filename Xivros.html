<h2>History</h2>
<p>The emissary Xivros decided to raise the powerful ancient ogre warrior Arleon the Unforgiven as an undead to guide Valindra's undead army in the conquest of the city. Xivros succeeded in his ritual and Arleon the Unforgiven became a wight . However, soon after, an adventurer sent by Sergeant Knox to stop the plot arrived and fought and defeated the ogre wight and likely killed Xivros as well.</p>
