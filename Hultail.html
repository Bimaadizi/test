<p>Hultail , in the distant past known as Rallyhorn , was a small port village on the eastern side of the Wyvernwater in Cormyr , where locals felt a kinship towards their northern neighbors from the Dalelands .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The settlement was a small collection of buildings that lacked its own Cormyr-appointed Lord. Its main notable feature was Hultail being the only true port on the Wyvernwater and standing guard of the trade "secret door" to Cormyr. The town's oldest historic neighborhood remained named after the founding family – Rallyhorn, a small smattering of streets around Rallyhorn Foregate street that connected the castle gate with what used to be cattle meadows, eventually turned into the streets of Hultail. The early streets of the Rallyhorn neighborhood once were the location of the town's tanneries and workers' huts, but eventually moved east, up the Wyvernwater, to remain closed to the receding Hullack Forest . In the 15 th century DR, the neighborhood was a humble place where one could find weavers, garment-makers, and dyers.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Hultail stood on the Hullack Trail that hugged the Wyvernwater's southern shores and the Thunder Way , a wagon-trail, started at Hultail, moved through Cormyr, into the High Dale , and down to Sembia , ending in Saerb .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Lacking its own government, Hultail was lorded over by Wheloon , Sarp Redbeard in the late 14 th century DR . The only major noble house of Cormyr that had a holding in Hultail by the 14 th century DR was the Wyvernspur family .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The village stood along a less-known trade route that connected Cormyr through the High Dale , the Hooknose Crag , and down the Thunder River to Hultail. This trade entrance was called the "secret door" and received significantly less attention than the tree routes through the Thunder Peaks and the Vast Swamp . The "secret door" was used by those seeking quiet entrance to Cormyr and by the traveling Dalesmen. Hultail received business through traveling merchants from the Dales as well as from the smuggling operations that used the "secret door."</p>
<p>Hultail's famous Trindar Shipyards was the largest producer of ships and vessels that traversed the Wyvernwater. Apart from shipbuilding, Hultail traded in fishing and running fish hatcheries. The Spawnhall , by Hultail's, hid a secret that helped the town with the fishing industry – a closely guarded deepspawn that created volumes of fish that was sold locally and exported to Suzail . Excess fish was used as fertilizer and ground into fishmeal for Sembian farmers.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Hultail was protected by a small group of militia.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before Hultail was a hamlet, it was the Rallyhorn Castle , home of an old noble Rallyhorn family of Cormyr, built by Lord Theldrin Rallyhorn . The town steadily grew around the castle that stood atop Rallyhorn Ho . Rallyhorn was renamed Hultail in the Year of Revealed Grimoires, 98 DR , following the rollout of the first naming laws of Cormyr, being the first settlement to do so.</p>
<p>At some point, many years before the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , an unnamed ettin was able to assemble a raiding party of goblins and orcs to carry out several attacks on the towns of Thunderstone and Hultail. Another monster-related event involved a single ankheg killing forty-two cattle beasts on the farmlands outside of Hultail all within a month.</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , three Crown mages of Cormyr were stationed in Hultail. The posting was considered to be remote and of no particular importance.</p>
