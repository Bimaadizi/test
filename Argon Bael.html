<p>Argon Bael was an angel of vengeance in service to the god Malar on the island of Moray in the Moonshae Isles . He was instrumental in restoring Malar to power during the 15 th century DR , for which his life was taken as a sacrifice.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He made an effort to appear as a human swordmage , although he seemed not to care if his true nature became obvious. In this form, he had pale, transparent skin that glowed dimly and through which his veins and arteries were clearly visible. A discolored, scaly rash marked his cheeks, extending down his neck and onto his torso. His hair was thin and often dirty. His eyes were hauntingly blank, but would blaze with light when he was angered.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was unfalteringly loyal to Malar, and fought hard to maintain and propagate the god's worship among the lycanthropes of the Black Blood tribe on Moray . He tortured and killed many innocent sacrifices to his god. He was dispassionate and quick to kill his followers, whether as punishment for failure or just to provide meat for the ravenous werewolves in his entourage. He was also quick to anger, and hated "heretics" among the lycanthropes.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, he had grown desperate to revive his god, and was almost scared to hope for the success of his plans to bring Malar back.</p>
<p>He only discarded his human disguise in battle if needed, such as to protect his god.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He wielded a greatsword covered in runes that glowed with a cyclone of white fire in battle.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He commanded a fearful respect among the Black Blood tribe, who did not dare to defy him. He despised the Yellow Rose of Sarifal , who converted the lycanthropes at Caer Moray away from the ways of Malar and towards a lifestyle of embracing their humanity and helping those in need.</p>
<p>He was in communication with High Lady Ordalf of Sarifal , who assisted him in his quest to revive Malar for her own reasons. They communicated via reflecting pool .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At one time prior to Malar's supposed death during the Spellplague , Argon Bael served his god by guarding a particular crypt in the ancient and ruined city below Scourtop on southern Moray. Following the death, Argon Bael was said to have spread lamentations for his fallen god aboard a seven-masted ship that sailed along the islands of Moray and Gwynneth , and seemed to draw out wails of despair from the land itself. He subsequently learned of a prophecy that detailed how Malar could be revived, which would require the consent of a greater deity , presumed to be Malar's longtime enemy, Chauntea . Invigorated by the promise of restoring his god, Argon Bael worked to keep Malar's faith and bloody rituals alive on the island of Moray among its lycanthrope inhabitants, aspiring to turn the island into a haven for their kind. As the decades wore on and any lycanthropes who had remembered Malar died, keeping the faith alive became an increasing struggle for the angel.</p>
<p>In the late 1470s DR, Argon Bael was informed by High Lady Ordalf that she had sent the crew of the Sphinx to Moray, and two of them—the empathic cat-shifter Kip and a priestess of Chauntea named Marikke —were suitable sacrifices for fulfilling the prophecy to revive Malar. Aided by Ordalf's signal fires, Argon Bael and his Black Blood followers ambushed the adventurers at Kork Head as they landed ashore, and captured Kip and Marikke as well as their ally, The Savage , whom Argon Bael was forced to duel personally. His troupe then rushed the trio to Malar's tomb in time to complete the ritual to revive the god. The ritual did not go smoothly as the Savage escaped and attacked Argon Bael alongside two druids who had infiltrated the Black Blood. Forced to unleash his full power, Argon Bael would have slain the Savage if not for the intervention of Chauntea, who caused Marikke to fall upon the angel's back and allow the Savage to slay him. This was done to provide Bael's blood as a sacrifice to Malar, which was the final thing needed to cause the god to be reborn within the body and mind of Kip.</p>
