<p>The telepathy discipline of psionics revolved around making contact with and affecting the minds of other sentient creatures, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such powers could allow a manifester to read minds, erase memories, instigate doubt towards one's senses, swap personalities, or spy on targets from afar. Some of the most representative powers of this discipline included aversion , psionic charm , and psionic dominate , as well as the psionic attack and defense modes . Its equivalent among the schools of magic was enchantment . Much like the enchantment school, telepathy had two subdisciplines called Charm and Compulsion .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Using any telepathic power required making "contact" with a target's mind, which some referred to as being its own specific power . Some even claimed that this contact power was necessary for using the psionic defense modes. Many telepathic powers also had the advantage of not needing to be within line of sight of a target.</p>

<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Telepathy and its powers were often stereotyped, in the eyes of the average commoner and others less familiar with psionics, as the heart of what psionics were all about.</p>
