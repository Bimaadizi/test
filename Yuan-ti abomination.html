<p>Yuan-ti abominations were monstrous serpent-like creatures possessed of both great intelligence and powerful magic. They formed the highest major caste of yuan-ti society.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Yuan-ti abominations resembled massive snakes, some 8​ to ​12 feet (2.4​ to ​3.7 meters) long and weighing approximately 200​ to ​300 pounds (91​ to ​140 kilograms), with scale-covered humanoid arms. Their scale patterns were variable according to tribe, but they had the wedge-shaped heads distinctive of venomous snakes.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Abominations often used scimitars in melee combat. They also attacked using their fangs, delivering a powerful poison. Abominations did not wear armor, for their scales were more than enough to protect them.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Abominations possessed various innate psionic abilities that made them deadly warriors: they could induce a severe aversion to snakes in any creature within 30 ft (9.1 m) of them, forcing that creature to stay at least 20 ft (6.1 m) from any snake they saw; they could produce acid to coat their scales, or change the color of their scales to match their surroundings; they could detect poison at will; and they could shapechange into the form of a viper of variable size.</p>
<p>Yuan-ti abominations could use the spell-like abilities animal trance and entangle at will; deeper darkness , neutralize poison , and suggestion thrice each day; and fear and baleful polymorph (into a snake only) once each day. Some sources added that they could use snake charm and sticks to snakes once each day as well, or animal friendship on snakes at will.</p>
<p>Yuan-ti abominations in their own form were dangerously venomous and capable of both swimming and climbing easily.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Unless one of the much rarer and more powerful yuan-ti anathemas was present, yuan-ti abominations were the leaders and masterminds of the yuan-ti, as well as the highest-ranking priests in each tribe's temple.</p>
<p>Abominations considered humans repugnant and barely tolerated yuan-ti pureblood . Like all yuan-ti, abominations found the body odor of humans repulsive.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Abominations were obligate carnivores and preferred eating warm-blooded creatures. Their favorite meal were birds and humans .</p>
