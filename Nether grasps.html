<p>The nether grasps were a pair of magical gloves found at Granwell Keep in the mid-1480s DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The gloves had a shadowy, smoky appearance, and never seemed to be fully lit even in direct sunlight.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Grasps made the wearer more adept at picking locks, landing lethal blows, and slipping away unnoticed thereafter. They also contained a benign kind of demonic strength that passed on to the wearer, and made it easier to cast spells with delicate movements.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The gloves were found in Granwell Keep following a battle between the forces of Thultanthar , the Harpers , and the demonic horde of Razagnol . The demons had been summoned by the Abyssal Planus Mechanus Nether Scroll after a Netherese arcanist accidentally used the Nether Scroll to open a portal to the Abyss .</p>
