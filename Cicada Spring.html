<p>Cicada Spring , also known as Grasshopper Spring , was one of the sources of fresh drinking water for the inhabits of the Nexal city in Maztica .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The lush Cicada Spring began on Mount Popol , where it cascaded down its southwestern slope into a small freshwater pool from where the waters were carried by a roughly eight-mile-long Aqueduct of Axalt towards the reservoir in the Sacred Plaza at the Heart of the True World . The waters of Cicada Spring were freely available to all and were beloved for their sweet and clean taste.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The aqueduct that supplied Nexal with freshwater was built during the reign of the Revered Counsellor Axalt , the successor of Chalco . During this time, often thought to be the peak of the empire, the Aqueduct of Axalt was the most impressive accomplishment of the Revered Counsellor of Nexal.</p>
