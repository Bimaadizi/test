<p>Gilda was an innkeeper and a serving maid from The Golden Apple inn in the Docks District of Neverwinter in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gilda was a pleasant enough older human woman with a light skin tone and light brown hair gathered in a loose bun.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gilda was in the Golden Apple's employ by the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . She could always be found in the inn's taproom, greeting guests and escorting them to their seats or rooms on the second floor. When priestess Tasina Alcrest was staying at the inn before her departure aboard the Midnight Rose , a group of thugs who were claiming to be Captain Allendry 's men were escorted to the priestess' chambers by Gilda. The criminals were mercenaries hired by Tasina to guard her on the trip to Neverwinter and beyond. However, she had no coin , and the men were ready for violence. The true crewmen of Allendry's ship, Eater-of-Garm and Nisar Zayid , arrived just in time to get a key from Gilda, to receive an annoyed comment from her about too many of Allendry's men running around, and to save the priestess and escort her to the Rose .</p>
