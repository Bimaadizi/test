<p>Anammelech was a Talontar blightlord operating in the Rawlinswood as of 1373 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He had empty eye sockets that built up slime , with a sparkle at the back of them. His armor was composed of flowing slime plates, never reaching above his neckline; he kept his head bare and filthy. However, Anammelech was actually amorphous, the armor being just a form he preferred from time to time.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>

<p>Anammelech could use ooze mephits as extensions of his will. He could also transport himself through the ooze left behind by his mephits. Fire had no power over him, and he was capable of moving without shifting his weight, leaving behind a trail of slime. Finally, he could engulf his foes with his amorphous body.</p>

He activated one of his agents, Fallon , bading him kidnap Araluen and fetch him the Keystone . After receiving the Keystone from Fallon, he set up an ambush for the party coming behind him. Though he managed to split Ususi and Marrec from Gunggari Ulmarra and Elowen , almost slaying the first two, Marrec barely managed to defeat him by employing his petrifying gaze against the blightlord just as the latter was about to personally engulf him.</p>
