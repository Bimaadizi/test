<p>Lord Haventh was a wine merchant and one of the members of the wealthy high society of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point, Lord Haventh set his eyes and amorous ambitions on Lady Firelia Jannath , one of the city's patriars and a notable patroness of the arts. He was among suitors who fought for the lady's hand in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , when her lover, Oskar Fevras , was presumed missing or killedâ€”in reality, captured and enslaved by Zhentarim smugglers. Lord Haventh requested to give his condolences in person to Firelia, over a glass of red wine from the merchant's recent shipment.</p>
