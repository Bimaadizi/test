<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He had a spell he once used to set dead bodies afire, which allowed him to claim the mantle of the Magister .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally a courtier in Procalith , after the previous Magister and crown princess, Nasana Melnuthquel , died of heartstop as soon as she had slain the queen, Sabral set the body alight with a spell and proclaimed himself the Magister. Immediately, he slew the king, too, declaring himself king of Procalith.</p>
<p>As king, he quickly had all his rivals, and many powerful warriors, slain in front of him. Then he had a number of magelings rounded up; five were brought to him, while one committed suicide rather than be at his mercy. He quickly sought to ingratiate himself with the five, explaining that his bloody coup was necessary in order to gain the populace's obedience, and naming them his Council. He claimed he meant to become the Magister, and leave it to them to rule Procalith, concerning himself only with preventing them from acting against one other.</p>
<p>He was found dead days later, with a harpoon driven through both him and the throne, most likely through the use of a spell. Lady Mimré of the Council thought to claim the mantle of Magister from him, but nothing happened. His Council were all found dead within a tenday.</p>
