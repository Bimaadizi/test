<p>Shar Cormrael was a member of the Dark Diviners of Windsong Tower in the 7 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Named for the goddess Shar herself, she discovered information in the library of the tower that gave her insight into Augathra the Mad 's last journey. Following up on this information, she was able to track Augathra to the fallen Netherese city of Synod in the Year of the Sundered Crypt, 684 DR . There she discovered Augathra just as the Mad Seer was completing a ritual to become a sharn . With the ritual disturbed, not only Augathra, but Shar Cormrael and a spying phaerimm named Xeris were caught up in the magic and all three were bound into a single sharn that in turn was bound to Synod's mythallar . The resulting release of such strong magic lured more phaerimms to Synod, where they formed a coven to study (and torture) the newly created, trapped sharn.</p>
