<p>A safehold or hideaway was a name used for extradimensional spaces in Faerûn , typically livable ones used for protection and privacy. Some sages called them " elf holds ".</p>
<h2>Characteristics</h2>
<p>Practically all safeholds were accessible only from one location; most required a certain key as well, usually an item or a spoken word. A few keys could be more arcane and complex.</p>
<p>A safehold somehow weakened the planar fabric, making the location vulnerable to interplanar intrusion; this was said to have been a decisive factor in the damage that Myth Drannor took from the Army of Darkness .</p>
<p>True safeholds were extradimensional spaces; their entrance portal was often opaque and invisible. Safeholds were finite, and typically rather small, about the size of a room with enough room for four people or maybe twelve standing up. Being extradimensional, they kept off most forms of detection. They copied the traits from the plane to which they were adjunct, typically the Prime Material plane .</p>
<p>They had a single continuous wall encircling them, typically covered over with some construction, and some form of illumination. True safeholds always had some manner of refreshing air, through invisible links to the Material Plane.</p>
<h2>Construction</h2>
<p>Safeholds had been created in profusion by the elves of Faerûn , but they were not created anymore by the 14 th century DR. Per the Knights of Myth Drannor , that ruined city had held hundreds of such safeholds in its heyday.</p>
<p>The air circulation of safeholds was made through special spells cast on stones that were then hurled high with slings; the highest point reached by such stones became a small portal for air absorption.</p>
<p>The construction of safeholds seemed to have been greatest during the centuries after the fall of Myth Drannor; the spells for the construction of safeholds had been just about lost by 1372 DR . The construction of safeholds called not just for spells that cloaked and locked the entrance, but also to circulate air and keep the temperature. Some even had means of removing personal waste well away from the location. As it was not common knowledge, a would-be safehold creator needed to devise the process anew; it might have required the insides of transdimensional creatures, or special binding rites, akin to those of a weapon with a legacy. Candlekeep may have held sufficient knowledge to get a creator, had he already surpassed conventional magic, started.</p>
<p>The would-be creator needed first to create the extradimensional space, anchor it to a given location, and then shape it correctly. If they wanted to create portals afterwards or add new features, unique magic items would need to be devised, then linked to the walls. One of them would become the portal for the entrance; other, unknown spells would have to be chosen for the temperature and humidity desired, as well as for links that would furnish it with air, and the ultimate resilience and stability that the space needed.</p>
<p>These spells, known in the days of Myth Drannor, were unknown in 1372 DR . Without them, the space would be swept in a matter of days, twist itself into a cavity full of wild magic, or worse. The spells linking the safehold to external air sources without allowing anything inside were also lost; modern safeholds used smaller portals, which could let in other things as well. The knowledge of the spells necessary to create these magically hidden lairs and safehouses remained a secret shared between extremely powerful mages and other arcane spellcasters, such as liches , who existed for a number of lifetimes, by that year.</p>
<p>The Sword Heralds created a number of safeholds starting in 620 DR . In particular, they created in 640 DR a labyrinth full of foul beasts, for the amusement of House Auantiver's youth. This was the site of the foundational event for the Men of the Basilisk in 1247 DR ; they were looking for more safeholds into the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Safehold Collapse</h2>
<p>A safehold whose walls were struck with disintegrate , or subject to other magical effects, might expel all of its contents through a portal, with the force of an energy vortex .</p>
<h2>Notable Safeholds</h2>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>Elminster's evasion , when used by Elminster, took him to an undisclosed location which he called "Safehold" . That location wasn't really a safehold, but a satellite orbiting H'Catha . Per some of the most obscure sages, it had been a gift from Azuth , after the original owner for whatever reason went missing. Other sages included the fact it had only been ever visited by Ao .</p>
<p>Some people spoke of "safeholds" where to hide money with no one knowing. Such a safehold could refer to a location or a service.</p>
