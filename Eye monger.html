<p>Eye mongers were large evil aberrations related to beholders that inhabited wildspace and preyed on creatures while masquerading as harmless asteroids.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>An eye monger was a hulking creature of 12 feet (3.7 meters) in diameter. Its body was virtually indistinguishable from a round asteroid, until it sensed vibrations around it and opened its single huge beholder-like eye and gaping maw, which was used to swallow creatures whole.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>These creatures did not value nor collect treasure, but some valuable items might be found in their stomachs as leftovers from digested adventurers . Such items as coins , metals , gems , and enchanted things were not digestible.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Unlike their beholder relatives, eye mongers did not possess the ability to project a cone of anti-magic aura from their eye, instead, the anti-magic was located within the eye mongers' gullet and stopped swallowed creatures from escaping via sorcery.</p>
<p>They possessed darkvision and tremorsense of 120 feet (37 meters).</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Going into combat, eye mongers stayed hidden until the last possible moment when they had an opportunity to bite and swallow the victim whole. During a battle, all they did was use their maws to bite and swallow. Swallowed creatures were immediately placed within anti-magic acid -filled gullet.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Despite being carnivorous creatures that required nourishment, they did not need to breathe.</p>
