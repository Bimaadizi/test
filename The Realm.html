<h2>History</h2>
<p>A group of youngsters from Earth — Hank , Eric , Diana , Presto , Sheila , and Bobby —became stranded in the Realm, where they were met by an entity known as the Dungeon Master and a unicorn foal named Uni . They would seek a way back to their home.</p>
<p>However, it was said that they and their unicorn were all slain horribly by Tiamat , long before the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<p>Despite the rumors of their untimely demise, they would later somehow find their way to Realms (plural) of the world of Toril one way or another.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Realm was a savage place with only a few pockets of civilization spread across the land. The Dungeon Master described it as "an exciting place of wonder and beauty—and grave danger". It presumably included both dungeons and dragons .</p>
