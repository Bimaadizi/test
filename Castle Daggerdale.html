<p>Castle Daggerdale was a keep that once belonged to the Morn family for several centuries before being abandoned by the mid-14 th century DR , and rebuilt in the early 15 th century DR.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Castle Daggerdale was built on the edge of the Dagger Hills , near the headwaters of River Ashaba , across a tributary east from the Tethyamar Trail .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Castle Daggerdale belonged to Randal Morn 's family, the leader of anti- Zhentarim resistance in DaggerdaleÂ’ . The castle was left undamaged but gutted by fires and abandoned, however, Randal Morn's people often used the old castle as a camp, using its old tunnels and basements to escape the Zhents.</p>
<p>In the early 15 th century DR , Daggerdale fell under the rule of Barathal Cormaeril , Randal Morn's great-grandnephew. In the Year of the Halls Unhaunted, 1407 DR , Castle Daggerdale was rebuilt by Domavos Cormaeril , Barathal's father, using the Cormaeril family's money to further accentuate their rulership of the land. In the Year of the Final Stand, 1475 DR , Neranya Cormaeril , Barathal's sister, was presumed killed outside Castle Daggerdale. Her posse was slaughtered by lycanthrope that recently started plaguing Daggerdale. Neranya's body was never found. By the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR Daggerdale became dangerously infested with lycanthropes, leading to Barathal Cormaeril becoming besieged by the children of the black blood and subsequent control of the region beginning to deteriorate.</p>
