<p>A tigerworm was a type of sea slug found in Kara-Tur . They were carnivorous and had black and orange stripes like a tiger , hence their name.</p>
<p>By 1357 DR , tigerworms had infested E'Tyon Bay north of Singye in Koryo . They'd sunk four fishing boats and a merchant ship. Singye authorities offered a reward to any who could eliminate the menace.</p>
