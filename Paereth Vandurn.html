<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Paereth Vandurn was a swordcaptain with the Purple Dragons .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Paereth Vandurn was keeping watch at Castle Obarskyr in Suzail at some point after Mirtul 26 of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , before the Council of the Dragon . When the fugitives Storm Silverhand and Elminster Aumar tried to sneak into the castle disguised as the Royal Magician Ganrahast and Lord Warder Vainrence , Paereth Vandurn was fooled by their disguises, but Rorskryn Mreldrake spotted them, and pointed out the deception to the swordcaptain. He agreed to hold the two until they could be examined; the two didn't fight.</p>
<p>Vandurn and his soldiers escorted the men to a holding room to wait; the swordcaptain received a few verbal jabs from the imposters, and a few snickers from his own men throughout the process, which he handled with some difficulty because of the confusing situation. However, before they made it to their intended location, some sort of distant magical backlash affected Storm Silverhand and Elminster, stunning all nearby soldiers, including him. The fugitives made their escape in the immediate aftermath.</p>
