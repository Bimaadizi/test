<p>Ronassic was a human historian from the famous Outer Planes city of Sigil .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point Ronassic recorded a legend from the sahuagin of Toril about a mighty megalodon known as Iakhovas , which proclaimed him to be "The One Who Swims With Sekolah ," the shark deity that was worshiped by them. Ronassic commited the legend to a book, a copy of which would later be found on Toril in Year of the Bridle, 1349 DR by the malenti Laaqueel while spying on sea elves . The book lead her down a quest to eventually resurrect Iakhovas.</p>
