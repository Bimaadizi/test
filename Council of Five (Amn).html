<p>The Council of Five was the ruling body of the nation of Amn during the 15 th century DR . It replaced the previous, anonymous, administration known as the Council of Six . Like their predecessors, the Council of Five strived to maintain economic prosperity within the nation, along with their already lavish lifestyle and copiously wealthy interests.</p>

While their influence outside the nation's borders was limited, they had complete and utter control of the country's domestic economy. The laws banning the use of arcane magic were still in effect during these years, punishable by beatings or torturous death.</p>
