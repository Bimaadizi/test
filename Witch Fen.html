<p>The Witch Fen was one a malevolent swamp located in the Feywild , formed from a river corrupted by Magra Curse-Eye and her coven of fomorian witches.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The fen could be found in the twisted region of the Feywild known as the dark fey enclave .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the fomorian witches proved to be a grave threat to the people of New Sharandar , circa the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the Iliyanbruen elves of the settlement took swift action. Their agent Triste orchestrated a plan to bypass the defenses of several witches by using adder's tongue leaves and their personal cauldrons, working alongside an adventurer from the city of Neverwinter .</p>
<p>The Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge was able to sabotage the cauldrons of three witches and gathered enough alchemical reagents to gain access to Magra Curse-Eye herself. The hero defeated Magra and her minions in battle, finally toppling the fomorian coven that poisoned a large swathe of Feywild land.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Beyond being the personal lair of Magra Curse-Eye, the fen was home to several other fomorian witches including Mab , Nyx , and Usha . It was overrun with their dark fey servitors, among which were scores of evil redcaps , hideous trolls , and cyclops brutes.</p>
