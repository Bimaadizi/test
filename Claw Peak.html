<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ammaratha Cyndusk kept four thousand-odd speaking gems in the spire of a ruined keep atop Claw Peak; in 1373Â DR , when she needed a number of dragons to spare Vangerdahast after discovering he had been crafting a spell to bind them, she told them about her stash, and gave them leave to split it.</p>
