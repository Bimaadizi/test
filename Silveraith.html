<p>Silveraiths were incorporeal undead that could only be created in areas of particularly potent negative energy .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Appearing similar to ghosts , silveraiths manifested as skeletal forms with hints of the clothing they wore in life. Their bodies were translucent and incorporeal , emitting a soft blue glow.</p>
<p>A silveraith lacked a physical form, so their ability to interact physically with the material plane was greatly limited. Along with the usual differences between incorporeal undead and the living, silveraiths were also impervious to the effects of cold, electricity, and polymorphing .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Silveraiths were able to harm living creatures with the merest touch of their limbs and although they had a number of resistances and abilities they were especially potent against spellcasters. In addition, they still retained all the powers, experience, and special qualities they once had in life.</p>
<h2>Psychology</h2>
<p>The personality and experience of a silveraith was undiminished in undeath.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On Marpenoth 2 , 1372 DR , the drow priestess of Kiaransalee , Irae T'sarran , used the power of the Undying Temple and her claw of the revenancer to transform the Archmage of Maerimydra, Duneth Wharreil , into a silveraith.</p>
