<p>Ruvya , also known as Ruvya of Bezantur , was a toymaker living in the city of Bezantur , Thay during the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . The fact that he was an accomplished arcane spellcaster was a secret unknown even to Bezantur's authorities.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was an old man with bright eyes as of 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was a happy and kind man who got along well with even those whom he considered enemies.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>From his shop in Bezantur, Ruvya's Toys and Amusements , he produced toys for children, dolls , puppets , and tops . His finely crafted and lifelike creations were renowned across the city and beyond, with some even finding buyers as far away as Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Ruvya was a Harper sympathizer who worked against the Red Wizards , however no one suspected his true sympathies: Bezantur's evil authorities, including even Aznar Thrul , regarded him affectionately. Ruvya maintained a Harper safehouse beneath his shop as well as an extensive network of contacts throughout the city, allowing him to keep tabs on activities all across Thay. He was one of only two Harper members active in Bezantur as of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, the other being Flamedancer .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ruvya spent most of his life making toys. By 1368 DR , his alliance with the Harpers and his network of informants was well established, and he had come into possession of a great many of the Red Wizards' secrets.</p>
<p>His enemies remained oblivious to his spying activities right up until he decided to retire. Fearful that his eagerness to depart from Thay might provoke suspicion, he turned to adventurers to help him escape.</p>
