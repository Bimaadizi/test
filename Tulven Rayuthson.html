<p>Tulven Rayuthson was a Warlord of Silverymoon during the 10 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was said to be proud and sadistic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tulven became Warlord in the Year of the Scythe, 982 DR , upon the death of his father, Warlord Rayuth . He was a sufficiently despicable ruler that the likes of War Captain Aeroth , a hero and champion of the city, left Silverymoon to live elsewhere.</p>
<p>Because of his abuses of power, in the Year of the Muster, 990 DR , Tulven was stripped of his position by the High Mage of Silverymoon, Nunivytt Threskaal . In order to prevent a similar incident from occurring, Nunivytt declared that the position of Warlord would only be granted during times of great need.</p>
