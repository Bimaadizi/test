<p>An yklwa ( pronounced : /ˈ j ɪ k ʊl w ɑː / YICK-ul-wah ) was a Chultan short spear.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A typical yklwa was four feet long, with about 40% of the length taken up by its sword-like, bladed point. It was primarily used as a thrusting spear in melee combat and was not well-balanced for throwing. It dealt more damage than a normal short spear but could only be thrown accurately with half a short spear's range. Yklwas could be wielded with two hands, but Tabaxi warriors typically used them in conjunction with oval hide shields called hlang .</p>
<p>The name "yklwa" supposedly mimicked the sucking sound heard when pulling the weapon from the heart of a slain dinosaur.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15th century DR, the sale of yklwas in Port Nyanzaru was controlled by the merchant prince Ekene-Afa .</p>
