<p>Mirrindith the Last was the Twelfth City of the Sword of ancient Jhaamdath , located in the region of central Faerûn later known as the Vilhon Reach .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mirrindith was established in the −4470 DR as the final City of the Sword.</p>
<p>Jhaamdath entered into a short period of imperialistic expansion in the Year of Overflowing Casks, −276 DR , which resulted in the deforestation of the Chondalwood and the slaughter of the Nikerymath elves . The elves responded in the Year of Furious Waves, −255 DR , by casting a High Magic ritual that caused a huge wave from the Inner Sea to wash over the heartlands of Jhaamdath, from the Bay of Jhaamdath to distantly inland Tuoxent . The cities were drowned in the new Vilhon Reach , and Mirrindith became a sunken ruin imbued with stray psionic energy from its lost relics.</p>
<p>The sunken realm of Jhaamdath was suddenly revealed by lowered sea levels following the Spellplague in 1385 DR , becoming the Vilhon Wilds . The situation was then returned to its previous state in 1486 DR by the Great Rain and Second Sundering .</p>
