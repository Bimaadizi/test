<p>Alathallgo Gathalynker was believed to hadbeen slain by a group of orcish shaves who rebelled and attacked their master while traveling the Orc Road in Zehoarastria sometime in the late 13 th century DR . His body was thought to be hidden and buried somewhere along the road that stretched between the settlements of Crimmor and Purskul . His body was still adorned in the Lord's magic armor. Alathallgo's skull was uncovered in the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , still wearing his distinct decorated helmet .</p>
<p>The slaver's torso nor his magic armor were found as of the late 14 th century DR. The Gathalynker family regularly hired workers to embark on excavation expeditions in search of the family's famous ancestor's body.

There was also a chance that the body was discovered many years prior; all his magic loot â€“ sold off.</p>
