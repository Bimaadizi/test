<p>Oil of disenchantment was a type of oil that could remove enchantments on a person or item for a period of time.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The oil was a type of lotion or salve that one could put of skin or items. These oils were usually made with 12 ounces (340 grams) of disenchanter hair.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Once the oil was applied, it would remove all enchantments and charms placed upon a creature, or if rubbed on a magic item it would suppress the magic for 2–3 minutes. Once applied. it radiated no magic, thus masking whatever enchantment was on the item it coated. After a couple of minutes had passed, the oil would dry and lose its potency, although a new layer could be reapplied if necessary.</p>
