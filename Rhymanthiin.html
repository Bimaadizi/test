<p>Rhymanthiin , also called the Hidden City of Hope , was a city on the High Moor in the Western Heartlands . It was a reconstruction of the ancient Miyeritari city of Faer'tel'miir , the Library City of Miyeritar . Rhymanthiin served as a center for magic, knowledge, lore, and the unity of different races.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The great boulevards and high walls of Rhymanthiin were clean and straight. They were constructed of massive, pitch-black stone blocks.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Rhymanthiin was located on the High Moor on the exact spot that the Miyeritari city of Faer'tel'miir once occupied. The High Moor was partly cleansed by this city-raising, and the toxins were redirected into the body of the lich Priamon "Frostrune" Rakesk , thus also starting the rejuvenation of the High Moor.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The city only accepted those who were "worthy of her," and those with malice in their hearts "shall not find their way here."</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The city had high walls and was invisible to most outsiders, appearing instead as an empty plain. Within the city, sharns lived within the walls and streets, and could freely emerge to attack any who threatened the city.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Construction</h3>
<p>It was created on the Feast of the Moon in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , through a High Magic Ritual of Myriad and manipulation of the Killing Storms by Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun , Tsarra Chaadren , and Danthra the Dreamer , all of whose souls were within the body of Tsarra Chaadren, and over ninety wielders of the Art. Among the notable participants in the ritual were the three grand mages and many other sharn:</p>
<p>This was all by the design of the Pentad , the five gods Corellon Larethian , Sehanine Moonbow , Dumathoin , Mystra , and Oghma . Khelben Blackstaff and Ualair the Silent sacrificed their lives in this casting, and their spirits went to Arvandor , the elven heaven.</p>
<h3>Legacy</h3>
<p>Rhymanthiin was largely untouched by the Spellplague of 1385 DR . As of the late 15 th century DR , the Hidden City of Hope still stood, hidden within the Feywild and invisible to any outsiders not welcome in the city. It had grown to be roughly the size of Waterdeep , and hosted the largest population of "redeemed" drow in Faer√ªn alongside good folk of all races.</p>
