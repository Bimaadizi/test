<p>Big Old Red was a large and powerful werewolf with red fur that roamed the King's Forest of Cormyr during the mid-1480s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar , the Purple Dragons were unable to perform their regular patrols in the King's Forest and around Eveningstar . This gave the opportunity for bandits and marauders like Big Old Red to run unopposed as they predated on travelers and locals.</p>
