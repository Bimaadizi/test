<p>Derval's Bright Blade was a weapon-smithy in Daggerford on the Sword Coast in the late 1360s DR, owned by the dwarf master smith Derval Ironeater .</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Of the smithies in town, Derval's was the best and largest, and certainly better than Cromach and Wayfel . His work was much sought after by fighters, and considered the best anywhere between Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep . Derval would say so himself.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It lay in Daggerford's Money Quarter on the High Road , between Kryptgarden Scrolls and Cromach's house, and behind the Jewelers' Congress .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>It was a large building, with pale-brown walls and roof tiles and gabled dormers on the attic level.</p>
<p>The sign that hung above the entrance to Derval's store was decorated with a branded image of an anvil on the sign's wood. The sign was unkept but its design showed meticulous skill.</p>
<p>The backyard of the smithy was full of tools that Ironeater dwarves had created and used for stone construction projects around Daggerford over the years.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>At the smithy, Derval focused on weaponry, forging swords , axes , and spear heads. His prices were high compared to other weaponsmiths.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Derval's Bright Blade was well established by 1367 DR , and still going strong through 1370 DR .</p>
