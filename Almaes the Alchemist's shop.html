<p>Almaes the Alchemist's Shop was the shop of the gnomish alchemist Almaestaddamir Auldcastle found in Ashabenford , Mistledale , in the late 1300s DR . Within his lab, he produced and sold a variety of alchemical reagents and completed mixtures. Among these were smokepowder , tanglefoot bags , sunrods , and various acids and anti-toxins.</p>
<p>On one occasion, Almaestaddamir made an offer to High Councilor Haresk Malorn to build a machine capable of flinging kegs of smokepowder at drow raiders in order to better defend the dale. The latter politely declined the proposal.</p>
