<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a portrait of Archibald Ravenshade painted by Oskar Fevras was kept in the attic of the Jannath estate of Baldur's Gate. That year, it became possessed by wailing poltergeist unwittingly summoned by the painter. The picture whispered alluringly, only to shriek later, startling observers. Other copies of the same painting were seen across the city of Baldur's Gate.</p>
