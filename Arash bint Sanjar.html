<p>Arash bint Sanjar was a Grand Caliph of Zakhara , ruling from the Enlightened Throne in the midâ€“7th century DR . He was the daughter of Sanjar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to a treatise by a Mar writer of the Utter East , in the Year of the Nine Stars, 657 DR , suffering the Plague of Fiends , the Five Kingdoms of the Utter East had sent ships out north and south, desperately begging for aid from their neighbors. Grand Caliph Arash bint Sanjar heard these pleas, but he saw the Ffolk people as only heathens and barbarians, the land as infected and ravaged by the fiends and undead .</p>
<p>Instead, he sent an armada of sambuk to the Utter East in early Mirtul of 657 DR. The corsairs launched a surprise attack on the Five Kingdoms, swiftly overrunning and seizing their defenseless port cities. Then legions of askar , clad in djinn -forged lamellar and thrusting killing katars , disembarked and marched across the land. With murderous efficiency, they razed every village and slew all they encountered, whether fiend or Ffolk, in what became known as the Scouring of the Utter East . The Grand Caliph had no plans to occupy this land, so by the time autumn fell, his forces boarded their sambuks and sailed home again.</p>
