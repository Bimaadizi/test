<p>The Black Chronology , also known as the Shadow Roll , was an alternate prophecy by the Lost Sage, Augathra the Mad , who penned the Roll of Years . In addition to her daytime visions that were recorded in the Roll of Years, she experienced dark visions at night while sleeping and these she wrote down in a book that eventually became known as the Book of the Black . She believed that the goddess Shar was the source of these revelations and that they were part of a plan by the Dark Goddess to destroy the Weave and its embodiment, Mystryl .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Augathra began having her nightmarish visions around −400 DR and they propelled her to wander Toril , slowly driving her insane. The Book of the Black was lost for over a millennium until the Year of the Sundered Crypt, 684 DR , when the Dark Diviners of Myth Drannor discovered it in the Fane of Shadows , a multi-planar temple that roamed the planes in service to various shadowy deities . The sages of the Dark Diviners studied the tome and thought they discovered a weakness or vulnerability in Shar's plans or perhaps the goddess herself at some point in the future, and they recorded their deciphering of the Book in their own tome called The Leaves of One Night . When Shar learned of this, she cursed both books to be illegible and then had her followers steal both works.</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , adventurers investigating a false temple of Mystra in Wheloon eventually traveled to the Monastery of the Ebon Dome on the Plane of Shadow . There, they confronted and defeated the Cyricist Skull Servant, Bineera Ethar . On her person, they found an unfinished letter to her superior, Blackwill Haarken Akhmelere , and a piece of parchment that purportedly contained the first thirty-four years of the Black Chronology and, more importantly, the matching names from the Roll of Years.</p>
