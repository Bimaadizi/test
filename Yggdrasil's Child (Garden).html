<p>Yggdrasil's Child was a colossal spaceborne plant whose roots anchored the asteroids of the planetary body in Realmspace known as Garden .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The plant's main trunk was woven together from several hundred smaller trucks or limbs, each of which were 50 feet (15 meters) in radius. The main trunk had its own gravity plane that bent around its surface, and it would take the average person six hours to circumnavigate it. The long time was because of all the leaves and branches that one would have to push and climb around. The smaller trunks extended all around the total area of what was called a "planet", such that it always received sunlight no matter where Garden was in its 128-hour revolution.</p>
<p>The main trunk did not appear to lead anywhere, as one would expect from a tree. Some tales of wildspace told that the tree actually grew into other planes of existence , as did its namesake , but there was no indication that one could use the massive plant to travel outside of the Material Plane .</p>
<p>The bark of the plant was a scaly wood that was resistant to damage from cold, electricity, and heat. The leaves of Yggdrasil's Child were the size of ships' sails.</p>
<p>The roots of the plant could reach 1,000 feet (300 meters) in length and forked and stretched deep into the interior of each of the many asteroids of Garden, holding these earth bodies close together at distances between 100 feet (30 meters) and 100 yards (91 meters) from each other.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil's Child had amazing rejuvenating powers, being able to heal damage at at exponential rate.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Garden took 1,022 Toril months to revolve around the sun , and in that year, Yggdrasil behaved similar to seasonal plant life on Toril , cycling through "seasons" of blossoming and growth followed by those of death and stasis when the gargantuan plant lost about half its leaves.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil's Child lived for about 2,000 years. When it finally died, a new plant was said to replace it. Scholars believed that the next Yggdrasil's Child would have some connection to one of Garden's moons named Grandchild, but exactly what this connection was remains unclear.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>A common wildspace tradition was to wrap the dead in leaves from Yggdrasil's Child before letting the bodies float freely in deep space.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Yggdrasil's Child had been in existence for as long as spelljammers had been sailing Realmspace. Throughout history, some had assumed that the plant was sentient and tried to communicate with it but never with success. By 1367 DR , it was estimated that the current plant had reached approximately half of its lifetime, aged at about 1,000 years.</p>
<p>The plant received its moniker from northmen, who named it after the great planar tree Yggdrasil .</p>
