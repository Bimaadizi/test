<p>Uther was the butler of the Society of Stalwart Adventurers in Suzail in the 1360s DR .</p>
<p>Thanks to an irreversible spell cast by Danilo Thann , Uther looked like an Abyssal denizen. The Thann family payed him a large amount of money for the damage. Secretly, Uther liked his new look, because it attracted some of the more adventurous female members of the circle and made it easy for him stop a brawl with a single look.</p>
<p>By Danilo's own apologetic words, the incident occurred during the Time of Troubles â€”many a spell went awry those days. He wasn't drunk, despite Khelben suggesting otherwise.</p>
