<p>Fey panthers were large, supernatural cats touched by the energies of the Feywild .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Owing to having been touched by the magic of the Feywild, fey panthers could move between the Material Plane and Feywild during dawn and dusk. They could additionally step through the Feywild for brief moments even outside of these times, appearing to teleport short distances.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Fey panthers were known to hunt much larger prey than did the common panther , even including humanoids . Their temperament made them suitable as hunting animals and battle companions.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>These beasts were stealthy, and were excellent climbers. They would hide in wait for the approach of prey, and then charge forward to pounce on their target and knock it off its feet. In battle, a fey panther's preferred strategy was repeated, ferocious pouncing.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Fey panthers were introduced to Faer√ªn following the return of the Feywild as a result of the Spellplague . As of the late 15 th century DR , they were present in Neverwinter Wood , and would sometimes accompany parties of eladrin out of New Sharandar .</p>
