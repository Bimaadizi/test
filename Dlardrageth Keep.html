<p>Dlardrageth Keep was the abode of House Dlardrageth until roughly −3000 DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The keep was sited in the area that would later become Dlabbradath in then- Cormanthor .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The ruined keep had five floors, three of which were accessible, and three underground levels, one of which remained accessible as of 641 DR .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>There was at least one library at the heart of the building. The rooms around it were dominated by rubble.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>After it became haunted, the Srinshee used it sometimes to try out spells with her students.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>There were a number of ghosts still in the keep. Elven high magic kept them anchored there, so that they could never reach Arvandor or anywhere. A number of defensive spells were still functional.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The keep was uninhabited for millennia, starting roughly in −3000 DR , when its inhabitants were imprisoned under the orders of Coronal Miirphys Irithyl with elven high magic after being found to be breeding with fiends to increase their power. Once trapped, they destroyed themselves, with most of the damage being caused by a spell battle between the Speaker and the Archmage of the house.</p>
<p>Per the Srinshee, the tower was finally looted sometime around −750 DR . She took Elminster there to trade spells in 241 DR and soon found herself challenged to a spell duel by Ilimitar in the central room of the keep.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Hippogriff's Folly, 241 DR , thirteen "ardavanshee" (rambunctious, delinquent youth) heirs of numerous houses chased Elminster into the ruins and attempted to slay him, believing him to be responsible for a deadly explosion during a party earlier in the night. Elminster slew eight of them, with five surviving, one of them severely injured in their wits.</p>
<p>The eight slain likely included the heirs of several houses, including the heirs to Tassarion , Bellas , Yeschant , Ortaure , and Maendellyn as well as the heir Leayonadas , likely of Ortaure . The survivors included Rotheloe Tyrneladhelu , whose wits were severely damaged, while Selgauth Cathdeiryn and three others managed to overcome Elminster unscathed. Tlannatar Wrathtree and Ivran Selorn were almost certainly among the slain.</p>
