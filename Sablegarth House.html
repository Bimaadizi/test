<p>The Sablegarth House was a striking residence located in the Uptown District of Ravens Bluff during the 14 th century DR . It was one of the most noteworthy buildings on Falyern Way within the city's Tentowers neighborhood.</p>
<p>Looking more like a palace rather than a family's home, Sablegarth did serve as the city residence for the noble Hawkdragon family, during the scant amount of time they spent in Ravens Bluff. It featured a facade of stunning black marble, that easily caught the eye.</p>
