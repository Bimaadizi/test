<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Nather was robbed of a set of six identical statues on a trip to Waterdeep in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR . The valuable statues depicted elven males carved from white marble and standing 7 feet (2.1 meters) tall. As the statues were stolen from a locked warehouse in Waterdeep's Dock Ward without any sign of forced entry, Nather suspected the use of magic and recruited the help of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors to help find his missing property.</p>
