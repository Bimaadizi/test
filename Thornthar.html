<p>Thornthar was a mansion in Cormyr that was a home for retired servants of the Crown.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The mansion lay south of Gray Oaks in the Northbank along the Starwater River .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Thornthar was a sprawling mansion with many wings for its residents. It had extensive cellars for storing food and medicines, as well as an armory that was installed after the Goblin War .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The mansion served as a secure home for retired royal servants of Cormyr. These royal servants were privy to much sensitive information as part of their duties to the Crown, so for their own safety and the security of the realm they were granted a mandatory retirement at Thornthar, where they could be protected from foreign agents and kept from fleeing or betraying Cormyr.</p>
<p>The residents often had younger relatives visit and meet to deliver fresh news and handle their investments. Some of them were mentally infirm and were happy to chatter about valuable secrets to anyone who would listen, though the truthfulness of the information was not guaranteed.</p>
