<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 1374 DR , Taelunangul's tribe came across the shipwreck of the Vigilant , a vessel that belonged to Sa'Sani 's trade company. The Batiri attacked the survivors, including the infamous author Volothamp Geddarm . Some of the survivors ended up captured by Taelunangul's goblins as well as some of the ship's precious cargo. Cannibalistic Batiri consumed several survivors, with only Vigilant's Second Mate surviving long enough to be rescued by a group of mercenaries hired by Sa'Sani. Chieftain Taelunangul was killed in the process, unwilling to negotiate.</p>
