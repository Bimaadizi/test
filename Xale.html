<h2>History</h2>
<p>Xale of the Starry Glen originally hailed from Selûnarra . Near the end of the Time of Troubles , Xale was in the Ardeep Forest , a land he did not know. While lost, he experienced a repeated vision of the moon encircled by seven stars. He followed the vision’s guidance making his way to Waterdeep . After arriving in the City of Splendors, his visions persisted and he sought out council from the Church of Mystra at the House of Wonder . Further visions brought him to the Church of Selûne at the House of the Moon . Both clergy had been experiencing shared visions of a joint order of knights to fight against Shar . Xale volunteered to lead this new knightly order, interpreting that to be the purpose of his vision. The Churches accepted his offer, and Xale became High Moonknight of the Order of the Blue Moon.</p>
