<h2>History</h2>
<p>She was originally from Heldon , which was torched by Undarl Dragonrider in the Year of the Flaming Forests, 224 DR . In 229 DR , Tassabra, who had been a thief in Hastarl for a while, became a founding member of the Velvet Hands gang.</p>
<p>She was soon targetted by the Moonclaws , surviving their first attack. The Velvet Hands attempted an ambush afterwards, but they were all killed save for her and Eladar the Dark, who was secretly Prince Elminster Aumar ; she died of her wounds, bequeathing him her enchanted ring at the old burial site, Ansildabar's Last Rest . Unknown to Eladar, who left to seek revenge against the Moonclaws, Tassabra was resurrected by the Magister of Mystra , Dorgon Heamiiolothtar .</p>
<p>After resurrection, she and Farl , leader of the Velvet Hands, turned to different pursuits, eventually becoming traders by the Year of the Chosen, 240 DR , when they agreed to take part of Prince Elminster's plan to overthrow King Belaur Aumar and defeat the Magelords of Athalantar . Tassabra met with the men of Helm Stoneblade and helped coordinate their movements. She was later part of the forces that snuck into Alarashan Tlor 's quarters. She later aided in striking down guardsmen with crossbows, stopping only when she fainted at the sight of Baerithryn turning into a silver dragon .</p>
<p>She participated in the festivities afterwards, once Prince Elminster crowned Helm Stoneblade as the new king of Athalantar.</p>
