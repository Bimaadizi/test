<p>The Riders of Nesmé was a military mercenary organization that served Nesmé .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1358 DR , the Riders of Nesmé sent a small score of soldiers to support the dwarves of Mithral Hall when Menzoberranzan's army were on the march to take over the ancient halls. Due to the somewhat tense relationship between Nesmé and Mithral Hall, the soldiers were only sent out of fear of Bruenor Battlehammer and Drizzt Do'Urden than to support the so-called alliance.</p>
<p>Around 1368 DR , the Riders of Nesmé were reduced in strength and number by continual troll and orc attacks. They failed to protect the city in 1370 DR when they were sacked by a troll army. In 1374 DR , First Speaker Tessarin Alaraun paid the Riders of Nesmé (along with Uthgardt barbarians and lizardfolk ) to defend the city.</p>
