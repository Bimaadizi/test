<p>A piwafwi was a drow cloak that granted increased powers of stealth and hiding. It came in two varieties, lesser and greater.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A piwafwi was a dark-hued cloak.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A lesser piwafwi was identical in ability to a cloak of elvenkind . When the hood was drawn over the head, it increased the wearer's ability to hide.</p>
<p>A greater piwafwi was a piwafwi with the added property of fire resistance. It was also known as a piwafwi of fire resistance .</p>
<p>Some drow piwafwi cloaks that found their way to the surface possessed enchantments that protected the wearer from piercing and slashing weapons, improved their protection against various poisons , and made them unaffected by spiderwebs and the web spell. Additionally, the cloak gave non-drow who wore it the ability to summon darkness once per day.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>The creator of a piwafwi had to be a drow and had to know the spells endure elements and invisibility .</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>Many piwafwi , especially those of drow nobles or wizards , were known to have other magical enchantments on them that made them strong enough to be resistant to magical and melee attacks.</p>
<p>Like many other drow items, direct sunlight would destroy a piwafwi , rendering it useless after two weeks of exposure. Even moonlight would fade it some. This was changed when Liriel Baenre inscribed a rune on the tree Yggdrasil's Child , allowing drow objects and magic to survive on the surface.</p>
<p>By the late 1490s DR , a piwafwi would lose its magic after merely one hour of continuous exposure to sunlight.</p>
