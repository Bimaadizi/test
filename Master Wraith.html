<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Master Wraith was destroyed in 1369 DR when it confronted Gorion's Ward in front of an old temple of Bhaal in the forest. It took on the deceased Gorion 's form and accused his foster child of forgetting his teachings, asking them to willingly give up their life. When this plan failed, the Wraith and its minions were forced to attack head-on, and were destroyed in the ensuing combat.</p>
