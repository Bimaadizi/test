<p>Endar Aglandtor (the "Sword Grotto") was an abbey dedicated to the dwarven deity Haela Brightaxe , and the chapter house of the militant religious group Haela's Host .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Sword Grotto was built into a series of dwarf-dug caves at the base of the Tor of Swords , a granite hill near one of the most northeasterly "loops" of the Winding Water , on Pelleor's Prairie northwest of the Hill of Lost Souls and south of the Marsh of Chelimber .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point before the Year of Sunrise, 1 DR , a quintet of magical swords associated with the Netherese successor realm of Anauria was entombed within the Tor of Swords, lending the hill its name.</p>
<p>When the clerics and crusaders of Haela's Host settled beneath the Tor, they found these fabled blades and gave them to their most able swordswomen. Striking out from their isolated abbey, the warriors of Haela Brightaxe were very effective in culling the monstrous population of nearby areas like the Serpent Hills , the Battle of Bones , the Forest of Wyrms , and the Marsh of Chelimber.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Because most tales confused the Tor of Swords with the nearby Dungeon of Swords in the High Moor , Endar Aglandtor was rarely visited by adventurers .</p>
