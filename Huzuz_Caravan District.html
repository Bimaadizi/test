<p>Though not technically a single district, the Caravan District referred to the area surrounding each of the gates of Huzuz .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Caravan District was crowded with inns, taverns, hostels, animal stalls, and caravanserais .</p>
<p>Mosques were even located in or around the Caravan District so enlightened Zakharans did not need to travel far in order to worship.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Caravan Districts were designed so that caravan masters and traders could acquire everything needed to load or unload their cargo and enjoy themselves, all within a short vicinity of one of Huzuz's gates.</p>
