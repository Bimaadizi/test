<p>Thimblewine's Pawnshop was a pawnshop in the Lower Port of Skullport .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Thimblewine's Pawnshop was a two-story establishment of fair condition.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Thimblewine's was widely known as Skullport’s most reputable, if unscrupulous, pawnshop. The pawnshop's inventory included an eclectic array of items, from weapons and armor to bags and miscellaneous gear, often pawned by local patrons or sold at a discount by merchants, particularly ship captains, who'd failed to sell them elsewhere. Stock changed frequently, with old inventory regularly shipped topside and sold through Thimblewine’s contacts outside Skullport. Occasionally, a magical item slipped through Thimblewine's assessments and ended up mingled with the mundane items on display, making the shop a curious, if unpredictable, destination for those seeking rare finds.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Circa 1370 DR , the shop was owned by Thimblewine , a shrewd and diminutive rock gnome . Thimblewine had earned a reputation as an astute fence with a remarkable ability to appraise the value of items rapidly. Through relentless haggling, he rarely paid more than 10% of an item's actual worth, employing his keen intuition and quick wit to press clients into accepting low offers.</p>
<p>One of Thimblewine's secrets was two magical items he'd acquired long ago: a medallion of ESP and a ring of human influence . These artifacts allowed him to subtly influence and manipulate his clients, often leaving them unaware that they'd accepted far less than anticipated. Many left the shop with only a handful of silver or copper for items of considerable value, bewildered by the gnome’s persuasive charm.</p>
<p>After Thimblewine passed away, ownership of the pawnshop was passed to his niece Krystaleen . Unlike her predecessor, Krystaleen conducted her business with transparency, purchasing reusable goods from visitors at the standard prices. However, all merchandise was priced at five times the standard cost. As of 1492 DR , , the shop had quickly earned a reputation for fair buying practices, even if her resale prices were high.</p>
