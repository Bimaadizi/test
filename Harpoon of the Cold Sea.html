<p>The Harpoon of the Cold Sea was a unique melee weapon wielded by the avatar of Ulutiu , the Lord in the Ice.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Harpoon of the Cold Sea was a massive harpoon that required two hands to wield effectively. An ethereal tether was affixed to the harpoon's handle.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This weapon carried a stout +4 enchantment . Once stuck in a target's flesh, the harpoon would not dislodge until willed to do so by Ulutiu and it allowed the god to yank the target off their feet like a ragdoll. Ulutiu could also cause the harpoon to reappear in his hand at any time if he wished to throw the weapon again.</p>
