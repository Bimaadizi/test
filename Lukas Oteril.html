<p>Lukas Oteril was a Sergeant of the Flaming Fist mercenary company of Baldur's Gate , active sometime before 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lukas Oteril's military career's main highlight was his command during a siege by an orcish tribe sometime before 1372 DR. As the horde attempted to scale the walls, Sergeant Oteril commanded the Boiler as it showered the invaders with sizzling hot oil . The contraption was infamous among the Flaming Fists for its backsplash that was just as dangerous to the Boiler's operators as the orcs who claimed the walls. The Boiler was feared and hated, but Flaming Fist could not replace the faulty device in fear of offending the major noble family that gifted it to the company. Lukas had the idea to get rid of the device. He ordered his soldiers to toss the Boiler over the walls on the climbing orcs. Even though that action did little to stop the invasion, the Flaming Fist grinned happily at the sight of the machine plummeting off the city walls.</p>
