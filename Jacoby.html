<p>Jacoby was a master blacksmith who ran a smithy in the Crossroad Keep on the Sword Coast North in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Jacoby had the appearance of a typical Tethyrian man â€“ busy skin, brown eyes, and dark hair. He wore his curly hair trimmed short and a well-maintained thin mustache. His face was permanently blushed with the sun from years of hard and determined work. Staring into hot metal left his lips dried and cracked, and hearing diminished. Despite his somewhat rugged appearance, his eyes gleamed with passion every time he examined a masterfully crafted new weapon.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jacoby opened his forge in the fortress of the Crossroad Keep shortly after it was reclaimed by Neverwinter with the aid of the soon-to-be-famous Knight-Captain known as Kalach-Cha . Jacoby continued his work in service of the fortress and its occupants in the years that followed the Shadow War , eventually leading his services to the merchant name Sa'Sani when she was granted residence within Crossroad Keep.</p>
