<p>Talonar Winter was a high-ranking member of the Purple Dragons in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>He was well-spoken. He rather resembled Azoun Obarskyr IV .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He was pretty capable at getting up and between trees.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was an immediate underling of Eskrel Starbridge during the time the latter was the top Highknight in Cormyr . For years, he'd been tailing Broryn Windstag , a nobleman.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1479 DR , Talonar replaced his superior in the Purple Dragons , Eskrel Starbridge, in a security meeting after the Council of the Dragon was postponed due to magically introduced toxic smoke in the room where it was to be held. Before he could contribute anything to the conversation on how to find the traitor who had bypassed the wards, the ghost of Alusair Obarskyr walked through him; he didn't say much of anything through the rest of the meeting.</p>
<p>After the actual, calamitous Council of the Dragon, Glathra Barcantle wanted him to look at all the bodies before they were returned to their families. She later commanded Arclath Delcastle , a noble heir, to report to him, as he was going to be pressed into service as a Purple Dragon. Glathra talked to Talonar again during his debriefing about the situation on the streets, on the same day.</p>
<p>On the evening, Talonar Winter eavesdropped on Broryn Windstag and Delasko Sornstern , two nobles who conspired against the Crown; he learned what they knew of blueflame items and their dealings with Marlin Stormserpent . Shortly after, he was the one to report, together with Eskrel Starbridge, that someone had broken into Staghaven House and slain everyone in there, including the person he was tailing, Broryn Windstag.</p>
<p>During the Festival of Handras , when blueflame ghosts were expected to be unleashed in response to the performance of the Blue Flame (actually an illusion cast by Elminster Aumar and his descendant, Amarune Whitewave ), Talonar Winter was part of the retinue guarding King Foril Obarskyr I , that ultimately protected him from Cymmarra .</p>
