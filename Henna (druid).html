<p>Henna was a druid from the Neverwinter Wood , active some years before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Much of Henna's life was unknown apart from the story behind the enchanted set of light armor called the Skin of the Forest . Sometime before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Henna became lost in the depths of the Neverwinter Wood, pursued by a gang of hungry trolls . As the rain began its downpour, Henna found shelter by an old oak tree . Eventually, her pursuers got close. By some strange magic, Henna began feeling a strange warmth that gently enveloped her. The trolls lumbered past the druid, none the wiser. When she emerged from the shelter, she found herself wearing bark-like armor. Eventually, by 1372 DR, the miraculous light armor left Henna's possession.</p>
