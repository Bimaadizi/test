<p>The untitled book that had the tentative name Shadow's Kiss was a romance novel and the fourth volume of four, all unpublished drafts penned by the amateur novelist Roan Featherway in or before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This draft received the most abuse among the three. Most pages of the book were ripped out, leaving only twenty or so last pages intact. The journal's cover had its title written in bold letters.</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>Only the finale was preserved of the fourth volume. The book's finale begins with Roa being wounded by General Ketheric Thorm , bleeding out in the hands of his beloved Harper Selene. The druid whispered to his sobbing lover to leave him as she could still make it out in time. The dying druid encouraged Selene to use a grappling hook and get to safety.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Selene was confronted by the druid Balsin as she lashed out at her perished lover in frustration and sorrow. Balsin claimed that Roa was the greatest among his peers and stated that he will always be remembered for singlehandedly breaking the Shar 's hold of the land.</p>
<p>The finale was followed by a note penned by a different hand. This part was written by Halsin , a druid of the Emerald Grove . He expressed frustration with the books straying this far from being historic accords. Halsin also threatened the author with being fed to Ormn the bear if he were to see the name "Balsin" again.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Roan Featherway was himself a druid of Silvanus , and his work was heavily inspired by the events of the war between General Ketheric Thorm and the joint forces of Harpers and the Emerald Enclave that took place in the late 14 th century DR. The draft novel's characters included the real druid of the Emerald Grove, Halsin . As of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , it remained unknown whether the manuscript was ever published, just like the rest of the drafts in the series.</p>
