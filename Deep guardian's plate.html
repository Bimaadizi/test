<p>Deep guardian's plate was a set of exotic enchanted adamantine heavy armor of ancient Imaskari that was a living symbiotic plate mail that sounded with its wearer.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Deep guardian's plate possessed a powerful +5 defensive enchantment and granted the wearer complete immunity to paralyzation . It also gave the wearer a powerful resistance to spells and magic .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This strange set of magic armor was developed by the ancient Imaskari artificers . Deep guardian's plate was a collection of magical living symbiotes that bonded with their wearers, granting them great levels of protection. The creatures used in creating these symbiotes were recovered from the ocean's darkest depths and changed through slow and torturous magical transformations forced on the creatures by the Imaskari. The deep sea creatures were magically grafted onto sets of plate armor and chanted not to require salt water, replacing it with the reliance on magic for nourishment.</p>
<p>The deep guardian's plate project was a success, and the symbiotes devoured magic thrown on the wearer, offering them increased protection, both from physical harm and spells. However, not all magewrights approved of the process. Many feared these new magically changed creatures would eventually grow hungry enough to consume the armor's wearer or their mage creators. It was recorded that only several sets of deep guardian's plate were ever created, only to be sealed away and, with centuries passing – forgotten. Sages believed that some of these sets of symbiotic armor slithered away back into the ocean after the fall of the ancient Imaskar, while others speculated that it was possible that these deep guardians evolved into something new.</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Fyldrin of the Eleven Chairs, a Rashemaar berserker corsair from Mulsantir wore a deep guardian's plate that he acquired sometime before under the unknown circumstances. Fyldrin wore the strand armor during his and his crew's drunken excursions into The Sloop tavern.</p>
