<p>L'zeth , mostly known as Bitter Breath , was a cornugon warlord in Avernus in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>L'zeth was obsessed with vengeance and was very ambitious.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Once L'zeth was a powerful pit fiend allied with Zariel . However, to gain more power, he started plotting with Bel but was discovered by Zariel, who demoted him to a cornugon. After some time, L'zeth became involved in a new plot to depose Zariel and was again caught. This time, the archdevil broke L'zeth's wings and cursed him so he could no longer enter into deals or sign contacts, and his voice became only smoke. Thus L'zeth became Bitter Breath. Moreover, Zariel prohibited any devil from associating with him. Despite this, L'zeth did not lose his ambitions and instead formed a gang of hobgoblins and became a warlord by the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR .</p>
