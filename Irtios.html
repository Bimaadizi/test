<p>Irtios was the common name for danburite in the Realms. It was found as natural crystals when mined from deep formations, or as tumbled stones in streambeds and among deposits of water-born gravel.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This semi-precious stone was a hard gemstone that yielded faceted gems of middling size. Irtios crystals were pale yellow or colorless and either transparent or translucent. A typical specimen had a base value of 50 gp .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Irtios crystals prevented mold, mildew, and rot from forming on all organic substances, living, dead, or undead, with which they were in continuous direct contact. These gemstones were often mounted on sword sheaths and wizard staves , for example. This protection even worked against mummy rot , yellow mold , and fungus-based diseases, but had to be in direct contact with the skin continuously until the threat was removed.</p>
