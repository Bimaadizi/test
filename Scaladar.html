<p>A scaladar was a type of metallic construct created by the archmage Trobriand that dwelled within his domain in Undermountain , known as Trobriand's Graveyard .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Scaladar were automatons made from iron that resembled mechanical scorpions in both form and behavior. They possessed two large pincer-like foreclaws and a segmented tail that arced with electricity.</p>
<p>Although the typical scaladar measured 12 feet (3.7 meters), models ranging from the sizes of war dogs to adult dragons were constructed over the years.</p>
<p>Scaladar were controlled by a series of magical rings known as Trobriand's rings . Anyone wearing one of these items was protected from their ire and could command any of the constructs located within a 100 feet (30 meters) radius. Scaladar could understand their commands regardless of their known language. If a scaladar received contradictory commands from two individuals wearing these rings, it would immediately shut down for an hour. Naturally, Trobriand's personal ring superseded the commands given by any of the other ring-bearers.</p>
<p>Some scaladar were used as magic hunters by Trobriands apprentices, swallowing all magic items they encountered, thus storing them in their insides for later retrieval by wielders of Trobriand's rings.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like other constructs, scaladar were immune to poison , could not be charmed , and did not require food, drink, air, or sleep in order to live. They were resistant to many forms of damage and even absorbed electrical currents and lightning, channeling it through the "stinger" attached to the ends of their tails.</p>
<p>Although primarily used in combat, scaladars could also use their tail stingers to join metal together in a manner similar to an arc welder .</p>
<p>They were innately aware of any other scaladar located within a radius of 100 feet (30 meters).</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Trobriand would sometimes sell his scaladar to other mages, dwellers of the Underdark , and buyers encountered in Skullport , most commonly rich satraps from Calimshan and curiosity seekers from Lantan .</p>
<h3>Subtypes</h3>
<p>In the years following the Spellplague , new variants of scaladars started emerging. It was unknown whether these were constructed by Trobriand himself, copycats, or apprentices, but they all carried the Metal Mage's influence.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Trobriand started sending scaladars directly to Waterdeep 's surface in order to dispose of his enemies in dark alleyways.</p>
<h2>Construction</h2>
<p>A scaladar was constructed from 2,000 lb (910 kg) pure iron mixed with rare tinctures and admixtures worth some 5000 gold pieces. The creator had to be proficient in armor- and weaponsmithing both, and able to cast arcane sight , limited wish , polymorph any object , protection from energy , and Shield (spell) . Additionally a Ring of Trobriand had to be either employed by the creator or they had to create a ring as part of the scaladar creation process, which of course incurred even more time, magic and gold cost. Constructing a scaladar, without a new ring, would cost a total of some 15 to 25 thousand gold pieces.</p>
<h2>Rumors and Legends</h2>
<p>It was supposed by some sages that automatons similar to Trobriand's modern scaladar were used in Myth Drannor , Netheril , and other ancient magic-boasting realms, and that some of these constructs still survived into the 14 th century DR. Other sages, knowledgeable about spelljamming , suggested that the Metal Mage's scaladars were derived from the smaller but frightening clockwork horrors , a theory supported by the fact that Trobriand kept a duplicate copper horror in his laboratory.</p>
