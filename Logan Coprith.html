<p>The High Merchant was aided in his duties as mayor by Guild Mistress Busya .</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lord Coprith was born into one of the most influential families in Trademeet. During his younger years he served in the military at Citadel Rashturl .</p>
<p>Considering the position of High Merchant is bestowed upon the head of the most powerful family in Trademeet at that given time, Logan was the perfect fit. Within his first year he improved the strength of the city's guardsmen and gained great favor in town.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Lord Coprith was presented with with a number of threats to the city at once. All commerce within Trademeet was put to a halt by a group of Calishite dao led by Khan Zahraa . They refused to lift their blockade until they could exact revenge on the rakshasa Ihtafeer , who was hiding out near the city.</p>
<p>At the same time, the city was also being assaulted by waves of savage beasts that were being directed by a group of Shadow Druids that took over a nearby grove . He and his guardsmen managed to capture a local druid , a shapeshifter by the name of Cernd , and imprisoned him beneath the mayoral manor.</p>
<p>He was nearly killed on Eleasis 19 in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR while defending the orphans of Trademeet from the onslaught of the Sothillisian Empire . He managed to survive the attack despite his injuries, and proceeded to work alongside the Council Army commanders from the Citadels and Hillforts rather than the Council , their incompetence having shaken his trust in them.</p>
