<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Company of the Anvil was gathered in 1370 by Bramas under the orders of his employer Kiros Tamadan , a spice merchant in Athkatla , who through various agents and blind contacts worked for Inselm Hhune . The Company managed to recover the scepter from a long-forgotten dwarven tomb in the Starspire Mountains . They were ordered to maintain a low profile on their return journey, and on Uktar 10 , they stopped in to the Blue Badger Inn in the village of Toralth for drink.</p>
<p>Later that night, three dwarves , Bapar Ghalmrin , Odak Truesteel , and Soram Battlebellow , entered the tavern seeking the Sondarr Scepter . However, the dwarves accidentally engaged in a brawl with the Shields of the Highland adventuring company. Bramas and his companions used this as an opportunity to escape with the scepter , but the dwarves eventually caught up with them and recovered it.</p>
