<p>The Dancing Goat was a bawdy tavern in Silverymoon .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Dancing Goat was found on the right side of the Moonway in Northbank , just after one crossed the Moonbridge from the southern half of the city.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The tavern had a revelry-filled dance floor. The rest of the establishment contained dimly lit hallways and upstairs rooms.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The Dancing Goat was busy, noisy, and full of raucous entertainment twenty-four-ten. It was not a place for peace and quiet. It catered to single folk hoping to flirt or find a partner, and professional escorts often went there too. Unfortunately, it also tended to attract pickpockets and other rogues .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The tavern had a surprisingly good selection of beverages, with literally hundreds of vintages stored in its cellar.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Dancing Goat had been in business since at least 1358 DR . At some point after 1372 DR , the tavern burned to the ground in a fire. A new tavern, the Son of the Goat , was rebuilt in its place and carried its predecessor's traditions of bawdiness.</p>
<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>A secret door somewhere in the tavern was said to connect with a network of subterranean passageways beneath the Silverglen and leading ultimately to Harper Hall .</p>
