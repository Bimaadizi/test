<p>Beholder grafts were pieces or parts of beholders that were grafted onto another creature.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These grafts were developed by bizarre cults who idolized beholders and wished to emulate them. However, beholders believed the practice to be abhorrent, and viewed it as a defilement of their "perfect" forms.</p>
<p>Beholder grafts did not radiate magic however they conferred protection against gas spores , who naturally avoided grafted individuals as they would a beholderkin .</p>
<h3>Creation</h3>
<p>Attaching beholder parts to another creature was a magical rite that was quite painful for the recipient. To implant the graft required familiarity with medicine and specialized knowledge of how to graft flesh and craft muscle. If implanting or grafting a beholder's eye, the process also required access to the spell (s) that corresponded to the eye's power. The grafts could not be scavenged or removed from a creature without being destroyed.</p>
<h2>Users</h2>
<p>These grafts were created by beholder cultists for implantation into their own members in an effort to attain power. These cults tended to arise among humans , goblinoids , or subterranean creatures such as derro , kobolds , or troglodytes .</p>
