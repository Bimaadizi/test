<h2>Content</h2>
<p>The scroll prepared those who were granted an audience with the Absolute . It claimed that those who stood before the "deity" were her most special devotees. It promised that all that was known by the follower was to be shared and made known to the Absolute, and the worshippers were to give themselves to her fully. The Absolute was said to embed a shard of her perfection in the devotee's mind, in reality, a mindflayer tadpole. The ceremony produced the True Souls of the Absolute.</p>
