<p>Yondalla's Children was the collective name for the halfling pantheon, which was led by the greater deity Yondalla, known as the Protector and Provider, the Nurturing Matriarch, and the Blessed One.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>

Green Fields survived the Spellplague to float in the Astral Sea as described by the World Axis cosmology model.</p>

In fact, some hin considered her a halfling deity who had conned the 'big folk' into worshiping her as well.</p>
