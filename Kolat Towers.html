<p>Kolat Towers was a wizard 's residence in Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The building known as Kolat Towers started out as an old stone manor and a pair of sturdy cottages. Before 1368 DR , the wizard brothers, Alcedor and Duhlark Kolat , bought the buildings and, much to the chagrin of the local building guilds, stitched the building together using spells such as wall of stone and stone shape . The guilds of Waterdeep petitioned to have the building condemned, but were unsuccessful. A few locals applauded the brothers' thrift.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The property was surrounded by a stone wall set with iron spikes. At one time, it was accessible through a magical iron gate. More interestingly, the property was later surrounded by an invisible, paper -thin wall of force created by Duhlark to keep out thieves and other intruders. The wall of force also kept out weather and extended one foot underground.</p>
<p>The courtyard inside the walls once contained an elm tree, some unkempt rose gardens, and several curious glass statues that were rumored to be would-be thieves turned to glass. There were two dilapidated towers of the structure as well as a rectangular building attached to the taller tower. The taller tower was six stories tall and the lower tower, which was only accessible via a bridge from the taller tower, was only four stories tall.</p>
<h2>Secrets</h2>
<p>Near the end of the 15 th century DR, the towers appeared to be abandoned and possibly inhabited by ghosts, although the force field still stood. The truth was it was inhabited by Manshoon and his lackeys. Manshoon also had an extra-dimensional sanctum accessed via a teleportation circle inside the lower tower.</p>
<p>Duhlark Kolat did indeed die within the tower. His body rested in a secret bedroom at the top of the taller tower. Manshoon had turned his skull into a flameskull .</p>
