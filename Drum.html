<p>Drums were a group of percussion instruments dating back a very long way and used by many races.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>All drums were characterized by a membrane, usually made of skin, though parchment or any kind of similar material would do. This would be stretched tightly over some kind of hollow resonating body, such as a pot or wooden cylinder, in order to create sound.</p>
<h2>Varieties</h2>
<p>Known varieties were kettledrums, side drums, bass drums, gong drums, bongos, tom-toms, cylinder drums, the changoo, talking drums, slit drums and hand drums . Special variants used in Zakhara were tapered drums or darbukkah , elephant drums , jahlah , the naqqarah , qas'ah baladi , and the tabl . The Iulutiuns had a drum called kilat made of a sealskin over a circle of wood or bone.</p>
<p>Exotic bongo drums were used on the Malatran Plateau . They were constructed using giraffe skin.</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>Drums were considered a popular instrument among a wide variety of races and cultures. Especially dwarves , orcs , and other creatures that dwelled underground. For smaller races, such as goblins and halflings , bongos were typically the preferred form of drum due to their portability. Celestials and elves however, generally felt distaste towards drums.</p>
