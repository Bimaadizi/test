<p>Bishtek Dlardrageth , who went by the alias of the Savage as of the late 15 th century DR , was a fey'ri swordmage from Baldur's Gate who kept his identity and heritage a secret. He was presumed killed by an aspect of Malar in the late 1470s DR.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As "the Savage", Bishtek kept his daemonfey heritage a secret, even from his friends and comrades. His more demonic traits—his spines, tail, and wings—had all been surgically removed, leaving terrible scars that he kept hidden beneath his all-black clothing. His appearance was therefore that of an imposing but handsome golden elf with dark skin, blonde hair pulled back in a gold clasp, gold rings on each finger, gold piercings (on his nose, lips, and ear ridges), and tattoos of golden lines on his face. His face was beautiful, with a broad forehead and high cheekbones. While his natural eyes were red with vertical slits, he used a constant illusion to present himself as having green eyes. He spoke with a soft voice.</p>
<p>He wore his greatsword across his back and kept a small dagger concealed beneath his black clothes. He kept his coins in a pouch beneath his armpit.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Bishtek came across as guarded, and his jokes and tales seemed as if he always had to think a bit before saying them aloud. He was sarcastic, haughty, and self-centered, with expensive tastes and a romantic preference for human women whose fates he did not need to worry about. He was also daring and loyal, willing to risk his life even for those he did not particularly trust.</p>
<p>He was obsessed with gold. This was not merely out of greed or a desire for the things it could afford him (although both of these were also the case), but rather he had a strong emotional connection to gold: it made him feel warm and comforted, and reminded him of his father who had left him golden baubles. He would flip a gold coin when he was thinking.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He was an incredibly powerful swordmage, able to cut down two dozen lycanthropes with little difficulty, to hold his own in a duel against an angel , and to dispel some of the magical power of an ancient le Shay despite knowing he was ultimately outclassed. In battle, his greatsword burned with red fire or crackled with red lightning .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>His father was Tarkhaan Dlardrageth , an exile of House Dlardrageth .</p>
<p>Bishtek was a member of the crew of the Sphinx , and served as the helmsman. He was indebted to the ship's captain, Lukas . He took the time to explain the ways of the world to Kip . He did not trust Marikke .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bishtek was born in Baldur's Gate sometime before the early 15 th century DR. His mother died in childbirth, which he was led to believe was because of his demonic nature. He barely had known his father, who had doctors remove all physical signs of his fey'ri heritage, leaving him scarred. Bishtek was raised in luxurious isolation within Baldur's Gate, surrounded by servants who kept bees and who trained him to be a warrior. During his time in Baldur's Gate, he fell in love with a young girl for the first and (he thought) only time. He ultimately escaped from his family holdings when he had barely become an adult, and he adopted the name "the Savage" as he began his travels, telling no one his true name.</p>
<p>Forty or fifty years later, in the late 1470s DR, the Savage was a powerful swordmage working as an adventurer aboard the Sphinx around the Moonshae Isles . He was prone to spend money wildly and to pursue sex with married women. He eventually seduced the wife of a powerful nobleman in the Kingdom of Callidyrr , and convinced her to help him to rob her husband. This landed him in debt and in prison in Caer Callidyrr with the possibility of being hanged. Lukas managed to secure his release, but as part of this arrangement, he accepted a job to escort Lord Aldon Kendrick to the ruins of Caer Corwell in Sarifal . Unfortunately, the Sphinx was greeted there by High Lady Ordalf , the ruler of Sarifal, who killed Aldon and tasked the crew with killing her half-sister, Lady Amaranth , who led a group of lycanthropes on the island of Moray . During these interactions, the High Lady Ordalf expressed hatred of "traitors" among the fey , and she saw the Savage as being included among such traitors. She also openly hinted at being able to see through to the secret of his identity. Despite his power, Bishtek understood that he and the party were no match for the powerful Ordalf.</p>
<p>As the Sphinx sailed to Moray, it was attacked and sunk by fire nagas and the crew was seperated. Bishtek protected Kip and Marrike as they fled ashore on the ship's skiff . Upon reaching Moray's beach, they were immediately set upon by werewolves and wereboars of the Black Blood tribe intent on capturing them. They proved no match for the Savage, however they were soon joined by Argon Bael , an apparent swordmage who defeated him. Bishtek, Marikke, and Kip were then taken into the Orcskull Mountains where the Savage managed to cut his bonds, silently killing yet more lycanthropes as he escaped and began to shadow his crewmates' captors to the city below Scourtop . There, Argon Bael took Marikke and Kip into an underground ruin, leaving only one werewolf to guard the entrance. As Bishtek approach, this "werewolf" revealed herself to be a Ffolk druid named Eleuthra Davos , who had infiltrated the Black Blood tribe alongside another druid, Einar Stormsson . Despite Eleuthra hating and distrusting any elves or fey , she informed Bishtek that his crewmates had been taken into Malar's tomb , and invited him to help her and Einar disrupt a ritual meant to revive the god Malar . The three of them launched a surprise attack, but Einar was swiftly killed and Eleuthra injured, leaving Bishtek to fend off the Malarite werewolves and then duel Argon Bael again, who was revealed to be no mere swordmage but an angel of vengeance . He barely triumphed (with the unintentional help of Marikke), but the angel's light revealed his true nature to Marikke, who feared and distrusted him. Regardless, the death of Argon Bael was according to plan for the Malartie ritual, with his death serving as a sacrifice that revived Malar in the body of Kip. The exhausted and wounded Bishtek and Eleuthra were captured by the lycanthropes, and imprisoned by Marikke in an old tomb . For the crime of having killed the angel, Malar reserved a special hatred for Bishtek.</p>
<p>Days later, Marikke was tasked by "Kip" with killing Bishtek. Struggling with who to trust, she decided to free him and Eleuthra instead. Before leaving the tomb which had served as their prison, Eleuthra transformed back into a wolf, and in her primal state of mind, was overcome with a sense that there was something inside one of the caskets that they would need. Bisktek investigated, and acquired a number of apparently magical gold objects which he took for himself as well as a loregem . These items would quickly begin to have a confounding effect on his mind, clouding and confusing his judgement while putting him more in touch with his demonic heritage (even beginning to revive his wings and spines) and giving him secret knowledge and visions that guided him toward a portal in the Breasal Marsh . Every step of the journey, he found himself falling deeply in love with Eleuthra, who outwardly refused his advances and insisted that she hated him. However, upon arriving at the portal , she would begin to reciprocate his feelings, and the two made love. Guided by the loregem , Bishtek then attempted to activate the portal , but realized that he needed the blood of a lycanthrope to do so. A chance for such blood soon presented itself when a werewolf arrived, and Bisktek slew him. However, this had been an ally of Lukas and Amaranth, who were also being guided to the same portal . At the same time, Malar arrived, having discarded what remained of Kip, and Bishtek realized that he had to hold off the god if Eleuthra and the others were to escape. He shed the magic items that had been clouding his mind and faced Malar alone.</p>
<p>The portal deposited Eleuthra, Lukas, and the others back in Sarifal, where Eleuthra was devastated at the loss of Bishtek. In speaking with her, Lukas confirmed the truth of the Savage's heritage. Later, Eleuthra would give her life in an effort to protect Lukas and Amaranth after receiving a vision of Bishtek evidently inviting her to join him in the afterlife .</p>
