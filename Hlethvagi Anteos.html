<p>Hlethvagi was the leading cleric of Loviatar in the city for a long time. Circa 1352 DR , he discovered the Long Dark Stair , a fabled and long-forgotten entrance to Undermountain. Using this exclusive passage, Hlethvagi accumulated a lot of money. With this money, he lived a comfortable life but also financed a temple for Loviatar, and finally in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR the House of Pain was completed.</p>
