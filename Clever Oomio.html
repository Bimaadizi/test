<p>Clever Oomio the Grey Seal was a totem spirit worshiped by the Ice Hunters .</p>
<p>It was forbidden for those Ice Hunter shamans who worshiped him to eat seal meat or fat, wear anything made from seal, or otherwise harm a seal. However, those shamans that worshiped him could call upon selkie form once each day, summon seals to their aid twice a tenday , and eventually even shapechange into a seal twice each tenday.</p>
<p>Additionally, iceguardians who revered Clever Oomio alongside Ulutiu also could call upon selkie form once each day.</p>
