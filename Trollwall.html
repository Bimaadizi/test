<p>The Trollwall was a defensive barrier that encircled nearly the entirety of the city of Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Trollwall fully surrounded Waterdeep's eastern perimeter, from its southern tip at Deepwater Harbor to the northern end of the City of the Dead , along the way acting as the eastern boundary of the Southern Ward . It stopped at the northeastern corner of the City of the Dead, at a small stretch of land known as the Cliffwatch , whose steep 100 ft (30 m) cliff of the same name acted as a natural barrier. The Trollwall then continued around Waterdeep's northern perimeter, beginning at the point in which the Cliffwatch's height was negligible enough for attackers to scale it, and formed the southern boundary of the Field Ward before doubling back south to surrounded the western seacoast.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>In the Present Age , the Trollwall was made of stone and measured 40 feet (12 meters) tall. The thickness of the barrier varied from 10​ to ​20 feet (3​ to ​6.1 meters) in places, but was most commonly 15 feet (4.6 meters) thick. The wall had crenellations on both of its sides.</p>
<p>Throughout its length the Trollwall was studded with watch towers. These were known as Trollwall Towers or torchtowers, with those bearing names being considered "major towers".</p>
<p>It was pierced by four major gates, one for each cardinal direction - the North Gate , River Gate , South Gate , and West Gate .</p>
<h3>Interior</h3>
<p>Running through the interior of the Trollwall was a tunnel and small rooms.</p>
<p>Every torchtower featured a debriefing room, a small armory, holding cells, storage rooms for the holding of evidence or confiscated items, some bedchambers, some garderobes, and three beacon-fires that were constantly kept on standby. Each major torchtower had six small holding cells in total, which could hold up to ten people and which were used in times of trouble.</p>

<h2>Law & Order</h2>
<p>Committing an act of arson or vandalism against any part of the Trollwall was a serious offense. Those who did so would suffer a fine of over 2000 gold pieces , plus the cost of repairs.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Trollwall began life as a wooden palisade, consisting of a single wall of spiked wooden poles lashed together, that fortified the northern end of Nimoar's Hold , the precursor to what would become Waterdeep. The original purpose for its construction was to protect the Hold from the regular assaults it faced from trolls to the north, though it would not receive the name "Trollwall" until much later. In 882 DR , the walls were expanded around the Hold and its perimeter. By 940 DR , the palisade measured over 800 feet (240 meters) in length.</p>
<p>Between 940 and 952 DR , it alongside Cliffwatch proved invaluable in defending the hold during the Second Trollwar . Because of the role it played in the Trollwars , the wall would later gain its name.</p>
<p>In 974 DR , the wooden palisade was torn down. The Trollwall was rebuilt out of stone and further expanded, coming to connect the wall around Halaster's Hold .</p>
<p>In 1007 DR , the Trollwall expanded to absorb the ruins of Halaster's Hold, making its perimeter run along the lines of what would one day become the northern borders of the Dock and Southern Wards. And in 1010 DR , the wall saw further expansion as Nimoar's Hold finally took on the mantle of Waterdeep.</p>
<p>In 1035 DR , under the rulership of Ahghairon and the Lords of Waterdeep , the Trollwall saw further expansion in order to accommodate Waterdeep's growing population. The wall's perimeter would move to occupy what would later be the site of River Street and Waterdeep Way . Further expansion to accommodate the city's growing population occurred in 1064 DR , with Waterdeep surpassing 50,000 citizens, making the Trollwall occupy what would one day be the site of Coffinmarch and Selduth Street . Around this time, a low adjoining wall was built to surround the city's eastern cemetery.</p>
<p>In 1101 DR , the Trollwall saw further expansion to accommodate more settlers, making its perimeter approximately occupy what would later be the site of Andamaar's Street and Trader's Way . Further growth in both population and trade would force the walls to move further northward in 1255 DR , approximately occupying what would later be the site of Julthoon Street and Sulmor Street .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>All of the Trollwall's torchtowers were manned by members of the City Watch . And each of the Trollwall's gates had a detachment of twelve guards defending them.</p>
