<p>Swiftsleep was a common poison found in Faer√ªn . It caused a victim to fall asleep for many minutes.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This substance was a sticky, viscous liquid that resembled honey the color of brown ale .</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Swiftsleep used a base of duskwood tree sap. This was infused with a distillate of the crushed remains of flies and common tree beetles. The abundant ingredients and relatively simple recipe made this widely available at a low price.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>This poison had to enter the bloodstream to be effective, typically by a wound from an edged weapon or arrow. The victim fell unconscious almost immediately, as if in gentle repose. The induced sleep lasted many minutes for a first-time victim, but each successive exposure to swiftsleep was less and less effective in duration, until an individual that suffered multiple doses became completely immune to its effects.</p>
