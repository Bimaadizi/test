<p>A merchant's scale , or balance , was an appraising tool used to measure the weight of items.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This small item consisted of balanced pans. Appropriate standardized weights were placed on one pan and the item being measured was placed in the other. If the pans remained balanced, the item being appraised shared the same weight as the sum of the standard weights. Merchant's most often used the scales to assure that precious metals were not counterfeits, but could be used to confirm the value of any item sold by weight.</p>
<p>A typical set would include an assortment of sizes of pans and weights. The scale usually weighed about 1 pound (0.45 kilograms) and was sold for about 2 gold pieces in most economies. Aurora's Emporium sold an especially accurate, tabletop model intended for wizards ' laboratories for 30 gold pieces. This set was advertised as being able to measure the weight of cricket 's leg, using standard weights from 10 lb (4.5 kg) to 0.0625 oz (1.77 g).</p>
