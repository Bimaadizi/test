Another of her abilities allowed her to puppeteer a corpse from a distance, and cast flames from their mouth, but appeared to open her to backlash if the corpse was harmed.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the spring of the Year of the Awakening Wyrm, 767 DR , Avroana received a sending from Shar herself that Dread Brother High Narlkond was striving for something that would bring them great power and opportunity. He then explained that he had trapped Queen Dasumia , an avatar of Mystra , and could siphon her power freely to cast arcane spells through continued human sacrifice.</p>
<p>Upon hearing of a Chosen of Mystra somewhere near Westgate , Avroana sent Dread Brother Elryn , a fellow Sharran, and five Dreadspells with him. However, while Dread Brother Elryn was out, she sent out Klalaerla , the Overmistress of the Acolytes, after them, with missions to slay them if they failed or deserted.</p>
<p>After Klalaerla found Elryn fleeing Azuth , who was fully manifested at Karsus' Keep , and herded his team back towards the ruins, their team came under attack by Umbregard and Starsunder , two meddling mages. During the fight, Dreadspell Daluth attacked and slew Klalaera. Darklady Avroana's voice came out of the corpse's lips, and she killed him back; the corpse was then struck by a sphere of purple flame cast forth by Tenthar Taerhamoos . There was a backlash upon Darklady Avroana, who caught fire with the same purple flames; while on fire, she stumbled accidentally into the midst of an ongoing human sacrifice, getting a knife through the sternum from her own faithful.</p>
