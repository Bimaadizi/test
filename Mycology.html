<p>Mycology , also known as myconology , was the field of study of fungi . This included sentient species of fungi, such as myconids .</p>
<h2>Knowledge</h2>
<p>Though many worked to classify fungi and determine their relations to one another, this was often the least interesting aspect of the field to mycologists. Instead, many mycologists in the Realms focused on studying fungi cultivation, fungi recipes, and varying uses for both edible and poisonous fungi.</p>
<p>When it came to sentient fungi, mycologists studied their breeding, their habits, and their social lives. This last aspect could include such things as migrations, territories, or even warfare. They usually hired adventurers to make in-the-field observations for them, as sentient fungi tended to flourish in remote areas that were rife with danger from either brigands or monsters.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This field initially arose in the Realms out of a desire to determine whether or not certain species of fungi were safe for consumption.</p>
