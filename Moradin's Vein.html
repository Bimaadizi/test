<p>The Moradin's Vein , also called River of Gold , was a magical river of molten gold that flowed wherever the dwarven god Moradin willed it. The river was actually Moradin's lifeblood and could be used for magical travel.</p>
<p>In the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR , duergar from Drik Hargunen used rune magic to contaminate the river with the Stoneplague disease. Several unscrupulous dwarves mined the contaminated river, which spread the Stoneplague among the dwarves of East Rift who handled the contaminated bullion. The plague was ended when the human hero Torrin Ironstar journeyed to Drik Hargunen and destroyed the rune.</p>
