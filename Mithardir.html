<p>Mithardir , also known as Pelion , was the third and deepest layer of Arborea . An endless desert of fine, chalk -like white dust, it was mostly uninhabited, containing only ruins and the buried remains of previous civilizations. Its only inhabited area was the divine realm of the Mulhorandi deity Nephthys .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The layer had almost no vegetation. It was entirely covered in a white, powdery dust that gave it its name―"Mithardir" meant "white dust" in the Elven language . Some areas were also covered in snow. Its climate was mild and temperate, but often swept by intense and sudden dust and lightning storms. The entire layer evoked a sense of emptiness, loss, and abandonment.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The layer was once covered in forest and inhabited by giant -like or titan -like deities.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The distant past of the layer was surrounded in legend and conflicting tales. The Seldarine maintained that Mithardir once held the realms of the lords of beast cults , before they moved on to the Beastlands . Others maintained that Pelion was the original layer that housed the divine realms of Ptah and the rest of the pantheon, before dwindling away due to lack of followers.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The primary inhabitants of Mithardir were the bralani eladrin . Other than that, the layer was populated only by small lizards , snakes , and desert rats , as well as occasional vultures , adders , and scorpions . Pelion had very few inhabitants. Most notable were the brass dragon Argevar and a phoenix who nested somewhere among the dunes. The layer was also said to be inhabited by a tribe of elves from the world of Athas .</p>
