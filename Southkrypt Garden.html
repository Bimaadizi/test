<p>The Southkrypt Garden , also known simply as Southkrypt , was the ruins of a dwarfhold on the northern edge of Kryptgarden Forest . The former name was derived from the fact that its dwarven inhabitants had constructed a magnificent garden around it.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Southkrypt was located underneath the mountains the dwarves called Maruutdin and the southern flanks of the Sword Mountains . It could be found east of the town of Leilon , northwest of the Stone Bridge , and north of the Kryptgarden Forest.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Upon the entrance doors of Southkrypt were engraved the national symbol of Haunghdannar —a seven-pointed star, above a fish facing left, and floating above a mountain peak. On the surface it was surrounded by a wild, overgrown and tangled garden. Its interiors were described as being maze-like.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Southkrypt was once a part of the dwarven nation of Haungdannar and acted as a defense for their eastern borders. At one point before it was left in ruins, Southkrypt was known to be a silver mine.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The entrance to the ruins was guarded by a tribe of hobgoblins , who worked to ensure that any adventurers who came in would stay and provide sustenance for their lord Morg .</p>

While the lower levels were known to be inhabited by storopers , vilstrak , vargouille , and xaren . The lower levels were also home to Morg, a vampiric hill giant shaman , as well as his company of three hill giant servitors.</p>
