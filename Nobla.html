<p>Nobla was an alcohol loving and somewhat dim-witted half-orcish crew-member of the Barracuda , allied with Zhentarim circa 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Unlike his mate Wierdnog , Nobla had no interest nor intelligence to discuss or even care about the ills and faults of society.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nobla, like the rest of his crew, was involved in smuggling of illicit goods to an army of tanarukka and orcs , enemies of Daggerford, in exchange for hefty sums of gold and able-bodied slaves. In 1372 DR, Nobla, alongside Wierdnog, was placed on sentry duty in the docks of Daggerford. During their shift, the adventurer, who later would be known as the Hero of Daggerford , approached the duo in attempts of gaining entrance to Captain Herab 's quarters. While they both were committed to their job, the allure of alcohol was stronger, and the Hero was able to incapacitate both with a sleep-inducing jug of Fillian's Brew . However, accounts of these events varied. Some claimed that another concoction put them to sleep or that the Hero simply slaughtered both half-orcs.</p>
