<p>Flowery Pond Well was a small oasis situated on the eastern half of the Kora Shan mountain range.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The oasis received its name from the water lilies that cover the surface of it.</p>
<p>The pond itself, however, was nothing but a muddy pool, shaded by some willows. This, along with it being largely out of sight, because of sitting in a low hallow, and the brackish water, made it an uninhabited, and little-used, oasis.</p>
