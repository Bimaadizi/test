<p>Ryomaru was one of the greatest assassins and spies of the Kumo clan of Kozakura , many years before the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Decades before the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , Ryomaru was renowned as one of the best at what he did. Perhaps his most famous weapon was Ryomaru's Harmless Staff , a hollowed-out, ingeniously designed and ensorcelled quarterstaff . Ryomaru only used the weapon on three missions, after which he abandoned it for more cunning and dangerous weapons. Ryomaru's Harmless Staff was left at the Hojori Temple , a front for the Kumo clan, only to be stolen later by the famous thief named "Chicken" Wu-Wei .</p>
