<p>Wearers of Purple , or Wearers of the Purple , were the leaders of the cells belonging to the Cult of the Dragon . They were so named after their ceremonial robes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After Algashon Nathaire became the leader of the Cult of the Dragon , the purple robes he adopted became signifiers of status within the cult; members of his inner circle began to wear purple as well during formal occassions, and thus, were stylized as "Wearers of the Purple". The masters of the cell in Sembia became known by that name ever since.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Wearers of Purple with knowledge of at least one necromantic spell, who cultivated their skills in alchemy and necromancy and held a black-hearted disposition, could develop unique abilities by serving dragons and following the teachings of Sammaster . They developed a moderate resistance to energy, typically that of the dragon they came to serve, gaomed divinely-inspired powers related to domains like Death , Evil or Scalykind , and improved their riding skills for dragons. They continued whatever learning in magic they had before; if they were without, they did not progress on that aspect.</p>
<p>Continuing their speciailization, they were taught the arts of potion making, as well as the enchanting of magical rings or other wonders. Those who proceeded in their instruction gained preternatural abilities, including a presence that induced fright, akin to that of a dragon in rage; if they developed these powers further, they gained a paralyzing touch, akin to that of a lich , and then a paralyzing gaze, not unlike that of the Sacred Ones themselves. Those who completed their studies of Sammaster's teachings developed their ability to rebuke the Sacred Ones as though they were common undead, making them that much more pliable to their will. In fact, during the Rage of Dragons of 1373 DR , many dracoliches became magically beholden to these dragon cultists; secret strictures were woven into their process of apotheosis.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The large cell of the Cult in Sembia was ruled by a coalition of Wearers of Purple. Wearers of the Purple started a campaign to cultivate new dracolich candidates in the region after the destruction of three dracoliches by Shandril Shessair , at the prompting of Aurgloroasa . Small groups of merchants had sought protection from the Eyeless Mask of the Wearers of the Purple in Sembia by 1370 DR . The leadership there was more concerned with their own infiltration by Tiamat 's followers, and at that time, with rumors of a multi-headed dracolich beneath Castle Perilous . Tiamat's church still sought to wrest control of the Cult from them by 1374 DR .</p>
<p>Wearers of the Purple had attempted to infiltrate Featherdale after their defeat in 1340 DR .</p>
<p>By 1372 DR , the typical Wearer of Purple's responsibilities included finding the lairs of evil dragons, offering tribute, and convincing them to become undead. They also prepared the transformation, and served dracoliches once created. Though most Wearers of Purple served one, there were some who served up to six. Nonetheless, Wearers of Purple were still perceived as the masters of the Cult of the Dragon. To any cell, Wearers of Purple from other cells were always accorded the rank of Keeper of the Secret Hoard . By 1479 DR , Wearers of Purple were expected to coordinate recruiting for any cell that shrank too much, and lead the cell in battle against enemies.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The majority of the Wearers of the Purple in the Sembian cell were warriors. The cult had priests of Bane , Gargauth , Xvim , Talona , Cyric , Shar , Velsharoon (starting not long before 1370 DR ) and other evil deities.</p>
