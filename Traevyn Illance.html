<p>Traevyn Illance was an old noble in Cormyr and lord of the Illance noble house in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was ruthless, and perhaps a little dramatic.</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>Traevyn Illance was white-haired.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He wore a half-cloak, worn boots, and carried a black walking cane. One of his rings was almost certainly enchanted in a way that would bring death upon a half-dozen people if needed, through means left unsaid.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Lord Traevyn had been a friend and creditor of Broryn Windstag 's father; he was the one person Lord Windstag had trusted from youth. His son was Rothglar Illance . He hired the mage Morligul Downdagger to keep up a number of protections against scrying and prying; two of his bullyblades were called Rorn and Brabras .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Lord Traevyn Illance was part of a faction that sought to mind-control the king and dismantle the War Wizards .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1450Â DR , Traevyn Illance loaned 700,000 golden lions to Rauligus Helderstone , with an interest rate such that 10,000 more would be owed on the year, every year.</p>
<p>After the disastrous Council of the Dragon in late Mirtul of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR Traevyn visited Staghaven House , looking to invite the young nobles meeting therein (Broryn Windstag, Mellast Ormblade , Sacrast Handragon ) into his faction. While he was there, Marlin Stormserpent arrived, asking to be sheltered from an unknown assailant who invaded his mind and controlled beholders . Before that could be resolved, Osbur , a servant of the Oldbridle family, also turned up, delivering a warning upon Traevyn, which he allowed the others to hear. After hearing out Marlin, and learning of his blueflame ghosts , he hatched a plan for Marlin to get close to the King by staging an attempt on his life, which Marlin would "stop".</p>
<p>That night, he sent the mages Morligul Downdagger and Scarmar Heldeth to capture Rauligus Helderstone, actually Mirt in disguise; only Morligul returned to him, with Scarmar cutting loose and fleeing after the strike. Morligul reported at the Three Ravens , after which they headed for the warehouse where he'd stashed "Rauligus"; unknown to Traevyn, Morligul himself had been replaced by the fugitive wizard Elminster Aumar . Traevyn then explained to the false Rauligus that he was going to make him sign off all properties by force as a manner of repaying his debts, and then ship him off naked to Westgate . Then, he got knocked out by Storm Silverhand , who was also impersonating Rauligus' current playpretty, the lady Darlethra Greatgaunt ; Elminster stole all his stuff, with an eye to take all his magical items.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Elminster and Storm resolved to spread the rumor that Traevyn Illance had captured and tortured Rauligus Helderstone to death as a way to slow him down.</p>
