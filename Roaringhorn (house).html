<p>Roaringhorn was a noble house of Cormyr . Both the Cormyrean and Waterdhavian branches of the family had a historical reputation for being bold, impetuous, and living with a zest for life. Their detractors characterized them as reckless, boorish, and lustful.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>The house had reason to regard the Bleth house in a bad light; however, it had been this way for centuries before the 14 th century DR , so nobody remembered why. They also despised Royal Mage Vangerdahast .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the abraxus affair in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , if King Azoun IV were to die, the Roaringhorns preferred him to be succeeded by a king or replaced by a governing council, and would not accept a ruling queen.</p>
