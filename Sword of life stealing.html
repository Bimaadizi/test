<p>A sword of life stealing was an enchanted sword that could steal the very life and knowledge from those wounded by the weapon.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Whenever a wielder wounded their opponent with this weapon, there were a 5% chance of stealing the life and experience from the opponent. The life would flow into the sword-wielder and heal them, if they themselves were wounded. The power functioned just like the abilities of certain undead, and could be reversed in the same manner.</p>
<p>After the Second Sundering , the swords would deal necrotic energy damage instead of stealing the very essence of the wounded opponent, unless they were constructs or undead. If hitting undead or constructs, the sword would no longer provide any advantages, expect for the basic enchantment. However, life energy was drained regardless of whether the wielder was wounded themselves.</p>
