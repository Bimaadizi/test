<p>Bhamm's Herbs was a shop in Eshpurta run by Eudhis Bhamm .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Bhamm's Herbs was located in the southern part of the city, next door to Gray Goose Provisioners , and across the street and a short walk south of the Hamstrung Giant .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The arcane arts were frowned upon in Amn and Eudhis would deny he had anything in stock (other than herbs ) that could be considered a spell component. Inquiries were often met with ridicule and scorn. Persistent buyers with ready coin would eventually be escorted to his "compounding room" where a vast array of spell components were available for double the prices found in other countries.</p>
