<p>Namarra , also known as Neversleep , was the name worn by three different enchanted rapiers of differing origins that probably fell into the hands of several different adventurers in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Each of the three different rapiers possessed different but similar powers that were connected to sleeping.</p>
<p>The probably weakest version of Namarra possessed a + 1 enchantment that made the weapon deadlier and guided its blade toward the wielders target. With every hit there was a chance for the blade to daze opponents for around 12 seconds.</p>
<p>Another Namarra was enchanted with a + 2 enchantment. With every hit there was a chance for the blade to put the target to sleep for around 12 seconds.</p>
<p>The probably most powerful version of the weapon bore a + 8 enchantment and was also able to put opponents to sleep for around 12 seconds on successful hits. In contrast to the + 2 version of the weapon, this was much more likely because it was harder to resist the effect of this weapon. Only the most powerful of adventurers could wield it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The three rapiers had different origins.</p>
<p>The dazing version of Namarra was forged by the dwarf Marrok , a blacksmith from Neverwinter who worked at the Shining Knight Arms and Armor . The weapon was created in order to help the adventurers that sought to rid the city of Neverwinter from the Wailing Death in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . To make the weapon, an enchanted rapier and a vial of dragon blood were required. After the plague, the rapier was able to be acquired around the area of Neverwinter.</p>
<p>The + 2 rapier was forged by the dwarf Barun , a blacksmith who worked from a makeshift forge in the Uthgardt village of Beorunna's Well . The weapon was created to aid the war effort against Aribeth de Tylmarande , who was marching against Neverwinter and the Lord's Alliance in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR. To craft the weapon, an enchanted rapier and a vial of dragon blood were required. After the plague, the rapier found its way into the possession of the smith Jacoby who probably worked in Crossroad Keep in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.</p>
<p>The + 8 weapons origin was unknown. It previously belonged to and was associated with the gnome Feckle Raspude . Feckle was a swashbuckler who used his Namarra to put opponents who challenged him to duels to sleep. In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, this weapon could be found among the wares available at the Quarry Office in the City of Lost Souls .</p>
