<p>Maukshoun's Rope, Cable, and Chain was a rustic hardware shop in the Seaglimpse neighborhood of Ravens Bluff in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This shop was located in the Seaglimpse neighborhood of Ravens Bluff's Harbor District , in a cluster of unnamed lanes often referred to as Gimble's Elbow . It stood across the lane from Safe Harbor Marine Guarantees .</p>
<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
<p>Maukshoun's was an untidy storefront, ramshackle like a barn and overrun with cats meant for catching rats . These felines were rather contemptuous and notable for being as big as a large dog .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>This shop sold all manner of bindings, including cables , chains , and ropes . It at one point had offered fine wires , but the proprietor was barred by city ordinance from dealing in them, after it came to light that all too often sailors were purchasing them for use as garrotes in alleys, back bedrooms, and taverns.</p>
