<p>Archmeagan was an arcanist of ancient Netheril who lived in Eileanar , the Karsus Enclave, until its destruction in 3520 NY (−339 DR) .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Archmeagan's close friend Parzal the Outrageous was imprisoned after dealing with his traitorous partner Mortimar , she took temporary ownership of his QM III business. He intended to take control of the business again on his release, but chose to take a long vacation outside of Netheril that meant that he survived Karsus's Folly —unlike Archmeagan.</p>
