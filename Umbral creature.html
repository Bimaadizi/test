<p>Umbral creatures were a form of incorporeal undead shadow , created by the death of a living non-humanoid creature that was then transformed into a new hungry shadow monster. They were distinct from shadow creatures , which were living creatures native to the Plane of Shadows .</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Umbral creatures were inevitably chaotic and evil in nature, and possessed an overwhelming craving to consume the vitality of the living. Though often bestial, they were not mindless and kept their old mental faculties, including their higher reasoning and any language skills.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As incorporeal undead, umbral creatures enjoyed an innate resistance to most forms of physical damage, as it would simply pass through them without affecting them. They were more resistant to turn undead than most, but were weakened in bright light or sunlight.</p>
<p>Their touch possessed the "taint of shadow", which drained the strength and vitality from their victims and could even kill them. If this was achieved, their victim would arise as a new living shadow or umbral creature.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Umbral creatures were closely related to other kinds of living shadows. They were created when a creature such as a beast, giant , dragon , aberration , or other non-humanoid was sapped of their strength and turned into a new malevolent shadow.</p>
<p>They could most often be found in the darkness of the Shadowfell and similar environs, such as the plane of Mabar tied to Eberron . When they prowled the Prime Material plane , it was often at the side of shadow magic -users, Sharran priests , and in gloomy, accursed places.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During their operations in Toril in the 15 th century DR , the Netherese of Thultanthar used many umbral creatures and living shadows to support their forces, mainly umbral worgs , rats , and gargoyles . They were also used as minions by the Shar-worshiping Night Brigade in Wheloon Prison .</p>
