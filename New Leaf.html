<p>New Leaf was a small but prosperous settlement on the Neverwinter River that traded in rare species of zalantar wood in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>New Leaf was built in the foothills of Mount Hotenow , along the western bank of the Neverwinter River. A science waterfall was just northeast from the village, and a single sturdy bridge crossed the river immediately to the east from New Leaf. Up the cliff to the north stood a strange foreign temple ruin. And an abandoned mine taken over by the duergar circa 1374 DR could be found across the Neverwinter River past the bridge.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>New Leaf's main industry was logging and woodwork, exporting zalantar. The Merchant's Friend – goddess Waukeen was the town's primary religion.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , New Leaf may have established trade relations with neighboring towns, including the city of Neverwinter via the merchant princess Sa'Sani and her Mercantile House .</p>
