<p>Dwarves' Deep , or simply "the Deep" , was a subterranean dwarven realm somewhere in the Underdark beneath Faer√ªn , far distant from the Dalelands . It lay along the Long Road , a thousands-of-miles-long tunnel under the Sea of Fallen Stars .</p>
<p>Circa 1370 DR , the dwarves of Glen in Mistledale traded their produce to Dwarves' Deep via the Long Road, as well as to the Great Rift and other dwarf settlements on the route.</p>
<p>It was once home to Forgemaster Inkstain and his kin, before he left for the city of Procampur in the Vast . He organized for a printing press to be shipped up from the Deep, which he used for a printing business he ran in the city by 1362 DR .</p>
