<p>Ondabar specialized in wood-turning, making smooth and strong shafts of wood that, upon their initial creation, were perfectly balanced with the spearhead , axe blade or arrowhead to which it would be attached. He also had a particular knack for assessing the inherent strength and viability of lumber and could almost immediately disregard any pieces with a fault or integral flaw.</p>
