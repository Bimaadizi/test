<table border='1'><tr><th>Location</th><td>Waterdeep , Sword Coast North</td></tr></table><br>
<p>Undermountain was a multi-tiered dungeon, consisting of several inter-connected chambers and lairs located deep beneath the city of Waterdeep and its namesake mountain . Originally home to the dwarves of Clan Melairkyn , the Underhalls were home to a grand dwarfhold before they were taken over by Halaster Blackcloak , also known as the "Mad Mage", and his seven apprentices.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>As a general rule, Undermountain was a structure with high ceilings of at least 16 ft (4.9 m) and smooth floors made of gray granite . Areas that were created by carving out a single rock were generally decorated in a way that made them look like other more standard areas. That said, exceptions existed.</p>
<p>A corridor in Undermountain was usually 10 ft (3 m) wide and high. The stairs had no railings.</p>
<h3>Magical Features</h3>
<p>Undermountain had lots of magical peculiarities that were placed by Halaster. Undermountain's proprietor made it impossible to cast magic that teleported people into or out of Undermountain. Neither would various divination magic work, so none could gather information about what was ahead. However, divination magic that operated through objects, and other spells like wizard eye , worked to some degree. Summoning spells also had limitations: their functionality was limited to snatching monsters that were already present in Undermountain. However, magic items that summoned creatures worked, at least as a general rule.</p>
<p>Destroying the wards that put these limitations was a task that was as good as impossible. On a pure theoretical level, it was possible. One needed a high understanding of magic to understand the many-layered magic, knowledge to determine how to dissolve it, the skill to make the dissolution actually happen, combat prowess to protect oneself from monsters that were certainly attracted to people working to dissolve the layered magic, a working speed that exceeded the speed at which the magic was restored, a lot of time measured at least in months, and the willingness to do this despite the work's doubtlessly thankless and likely fruitless nature.</p>
<p>Another effect of the many-layered magic of the Mad Mage was that most of the dungeon radiated magic including the floor, ceilings, and walls. This made spells like detect magic from time to time useless ones because either the radiated magic was so strong that it was impossible distinguish specific things like magic items or because the radiated magic worked as some kind of background noise that masked the radiated magic of other things.</p>
<p>The complex magics of Undermountain were intertwined with Halaster himself. In the event of the Mad Mage's death or removal from Undermountain, its enchantments and spells would go wild. Countless gates and portals would become destabilized and open wide for many powerful dragons and other monsters to pour into the mega-dungeon. The arcane chaos would continue to rage through Undermountain until Mystra's Chosen , Weaveghosts , and other servants "set in" the spells and enchantments in place once again.</p>
<p>Undermountain had some areas where magic did not work. The origins of these were not exactly known but suspected to be the result of magical experiments.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>Undermountain had quite good ventilation due to a plethora of air sources and some magical support. While areas where the ventilation was bad existed, for example due to a sealed door or being connected to sewers , death from suffocation or gas explosion was not hazard that one needed to prepare for as high priority.</p>
<p>All in all, Undermountain's climate could be compared to a normal Waterdhavian cellar, cold and a bit dank. When an area was more humid than what was normal, it could mean that a water source was nearby, sometimes also fungal growth. When it was drier than normal, it usually meant that one was far from a water source.</p>
<p>Interestingly, deeper levels were a bit warmer than upper ones. This was attributed to volcanic activities, but this was more a theory than proven fact.</p>
<h2>Entrances and Exits</h2>
<p>The halls of Undermountain were linked to the surface world in many ways, both physical and magical. Some worked only one-way.The dungeon had number of connections with Waterdeep's sewers and through this connection, it was indirectly connected to other dungeons. Halaster used his network of portals to bring in monsters from all across Faerûn to restock his dungeon. Some of the notable physical links are described below:</p>
<h2>Levels of Undermountain</h2>
<h3>Major Levels</h3>
<h3>Sub-Levels</h3>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Aelinthaldaar , the capital city of Illefarn , was founded around −8500 DR and first started to dig crypts in the area. Various power groups lived in Undermountain, sometimes at the same time:</p>
<h3>Melairkyn Clan</h3>
<p>In −1288 DR , a shield dwarf called Melair explored and found mithril in the mountain that was later called Mount Waterdeep both for the first time. At that time, however, it was called Mount Melairbode after Melair. Clan Melairkyn , a dwarven clan that eventually traced its ancestry back to Melair built in the same year the Underhalls inside the mountain. They then formed an arrangement with the elves of Illefarn, their mithril for the elves' magic , namely one that prevented the caverns to collapse no matter what. This clan of dwarves operated two mithril mines in the Seadeeps .</p>
<p>Around 34 DR , a combined force of drow and duergar forced the dwarves into deeper and unimportant sections of Underhalls. The mithril mines were taken over by the duergar, who left the place after the mines dried out. The drow continued to force the dwarves into ever lower and ever less important places until the dwarves died out in 211 DR . Underhalls was then named Kyorlamshin by the drow.</p>
<h3>Halaster Blackcloak</h3>
<p>In 168 DR , Halaster Blackcloak and his seven apprentices came to Kyorlamshin. To be more precise, he built Halaster's Hold in the Deepwater Plateau . He used summoned creatures to dig cellars and the likes for himself. This was done often and in ever deeper areas for decades that at some point his creatures managed to break into the Underhalls. The mage started to explore the underground complex as well as staking claims for himself regarding the underground areas.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the duergar were in the process of leaving once the mithral was running dry, and when it came to the drow, they fell victim to surface elves . The remnants of these two parties fell victim to Halaster in 309 DR . Halaster modified captured drow into his servitors and entered a genocidal frenzy that led to the term "Halaster's Hunt" to be coined. This term meant "berserk raid" or "willful slaughter", and was still in use in the North of the 14 th century DR . Halaster started to move into the underground complex and also began to modify it by building traps. He turned the complex into a storage of his belongings, experiment results, and so on. His apprentices, who were already starting to carve out their own demenses by 307 DR , put serious effort in finding their master. Their mettle was tested by Halaster, two died, and the rest was employed by the Mad Mage to enhance the underground complex's security. Over the years, the upper levels became abandoned as a storage and research faculty, those functions were moved ever deeper into the complex. Halaster started to turn the upper levels into a buffer zone to kill intruders. Towards that end, he went to other planes and places, collected monsters, and set them out to protect these levels from intruders, this also had a touch as Halaster's playing ground as he started to use the dungeon to satisfy his hobbies.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Dangerous Game, 658 DR , a portal was built in secret between the Hall of Naturalists in Cormanthyr and Undermountain. The Guild of Naturalists started to break into Halaster's property to abduct his monsters for themselves. Halaster started to abduct wizards from Cormanthyr as an act of retaliation. It was only in 680 DR that the Guild of Naturalists managed to understand that the abductions over the decade in between were done as a response to their actions. After seeing that an expedition team with the goal of bringing back their abductees did not come back, the Guild of Naturalists stopped poaching. However, they were incapable of shutting down the portal that connected the two places.</p>
<h3>Waterdeep</h3>
<p>At some point in history, Halaster came up with the idea to create a duplicate of himself, possibly a clone , infect it with leprosy , and let the eventual corpse be found by Waterdeep's police force. This led to the false information of Halaster's death be spread in Waterdeep. By 1371 DR, the notion of a powerful crazy wizard living in Undermountain was the stuff of rumors and not verified information. However, among Undermountain-travelers, it was common to at least think that he was still alive.</p>
<p>This false information about the Mad Mage's death's spreading's original intention by Halaster was to ensure that nobody bothered him while he was doing his research in his home. However, the idea that the powerful mage was dead led to many folks thinking that the major obstacle against plundering the wizard's place was gone. These people became burglars bent on taking whatever they could from Halaster's dungeon. Them getting killed by Halaster's traps and roaming creatures that he released was a major source of joy for the Mad Mage as was the false sense of security that his false death represented to people.</p>
<p>As Waterdeep grew as a city, the city came into contact with the dungeon. This included literal contact in the form of sewers that broke into Halaster's dungeon as they were dug. Lords of Waterdeep used the dungeon to get rid of criminals they considered particularly hard to handle in the Year of the Broken Helm, 1302 DR . This took the form of sending them from their prisons to uncharted parts of Undermountain. This last action at the hands of Waterdeep's rulers led to Undermountain getting a bad reputation overall and one as the deepest dungeon in the world, the latter was considered to be of dubious veracity.</p>
<p>Also in 1302 DR, Durnan the Wanderer and Mirt the Merciless went into Undermountain. Unlike many others, they did not just come out as a living men but also as rich ones. Durnan did two things: first, he built the Yawning Portal inn where Halaster's Hold 's ruins stood. Second, he spread the information about Undermountain's size and wealth like others who successfully returned from the dungeon. This led many people for various reasons to go to Durnan's inn that held the shaft to enter the dungeon.</p>
<p>The Citadel of the Bloody Hand was the launching point of the Thieves' Guild of Waterdeep before they were driven out of the city.</p>
<p>Various criminal groups used portions of the ruins [ as of when? ] as their headquarters as do followers of evil gods. Halaster's death in 1375 DR and the earthquake that accompanied it altered terrain and also upset the balance of power among the various groups. It was around ten years later when the Spellplague occurred and once again drastic change came to Undermountain. Many of the numerous portals in the ruins were destroyed, cutting off entire levels. Other portals were warped and seemingly granted access to previously unknown levels. Also it was feared that pockets of Spellplague may still exist in Undermountain. [ citation needed ]</p>
<h2>Undermountain and Halaster Blackcloak</h2>
<p>Over a thousand years ago, [ as of when? ] the wizard Halaster Blackcloak whirled to the base of Mount Waterdeep , called there from a distant country by chance or providence. Some say he hailed from the Cradlelands , the nearly forgotten empire that spread humanity across Faerûn , Kara-Tur , and Zakhara , from what is now the Plains of Purple Dust, a wasteland created by conflict between the gods. Whatever his origins, Halaster brought with him the Seven, as his apprentices were known, and with their help and his power, Halaster summoned beings from other planes to build himself a wizard's tower. Halaster ringed his tower with a great wall set with lesser towers for each of his apprentices, and he created fields and farms to be worked by his apprentices and their servants. [ citation needed ]</p>
<p>For a time, [ as of when? ] it seemed a good life for the Seven, but as the days wore on, they saw less and less of their master. Halaster continued to use fell creatures from other planes for construction beneath his tower, and he kept his dealings with them and the nature of the tunnels from the Seven. At length, Halaster's tunneling broke into the Underhalls, a complex of tunnels built by dwarves around a mithral mine beneath Mount Waterdeep . The dwarves who built the dungeons, the Melairkyn clan, had long since been killed or dispersed, replaced by warring duergar and drow . Halaster began a crusade against both races, participating in wild hunts through the tunnels with allies called from the Outer Planes . The duergar stubbornly remained until the mithral was largely mined out, but then they left the drow to fight Halaster and his minions alone. Halaster captured or killed the remaining drow, entrapping their souls for dark magic or twisting their bodies and enslaving their minds. When the last of the drow were defeated, Halaster Blackcloak tunneled on, continuing his obsession with delving beneath the mountain. [ citation needed ]</p>
<p>After Halaster was absent for more than a year, [ as of when? ] some of his apprentices ventured into his tower in search of the great wizard. They found traps, monsters, and tantalizing hints about power beneath the earth. Individually they explored the dungeons, encountering ever more deadly traps and more powerful foes. For their efforts, they were rewarded with riches and magic. When the Seven were reduced to five, [ as of when? ] Halaster appeared to his students and explained that he had built the tunnels to guard his experiments and treasures. He enlisted their aid to make his dungeons even more secure. [ citation needed ]</p>
<p>What happened after that is unclear, but only one apprentice is known to have left Undermountain, and she fled the area, never to return. Halaster continued to live beneath the mountain, using it as a base from which he traveled to other planes and distant lands, entrapping strange creatures and bringing them back to live as prisoners or guardians in his home. In time, Halaster sought out magic to extend his life, and some say that it was these spells and items that finally drove Halaster beyond all reason. While before he had been obsessed and deranged, his quest for immortality seemed to drive him truly mad. [ citation needed ]</p>
<p>While Halaster quested on other planes and sequestered himself in his tunnels, his tower fell into ruin. [ as of when? ] When Halaster was yet active in the outside world, his home was considered cursed, so settlers in the area largely left the crumbling tower alone. In time, the city now known as Waterdeep came to huddle against the mountain and reach down to the harbor. As the city sprawled outward, it reached and encompassed the ruins of Halaster's home. Undermountain was known to these early settlers, and they often punished criminals by sending them into its depths. This continued for many years until an adventurer named Durnan delved into the depths beneath the tower and returned, laden with riches, to tell the tale. Durnan demolished the last remnants of Halaster's above-ground abode and built an inn over the well he had used to descend into the depths. He called his inn the Yawning Portal , and Durnan works there to this day, [ as of when? ] serving patrons and inviting the brave or the foolish to try their hands at the halls of Undermountain.
