<p>Faraway was a fictional village created by the demon lord Graz'zt as an elaborate magical trap to trick and destroy his enemies during the Rage of Demons in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The village was a mix of illusions and conjurations in the underground cavern, creating the realistic experience of being in a quaint rural village. The villagers were actually demons playing roles, mostly dretches and succubi . Adjacent to the village was Duke Bowen's castle, which had an elaborate hedge maze.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Faraway was narratively placed east of Daggerford on the Sword Coast , though it was truly somewhere in the Eastern Reaches of Tethyamar.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>In the village's story, the ruler was Duke Bowen, an elderly man with a few retainers who lived in an adjacent keep. The village was run by Mayor Thomas.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Graz'zt created the Faraway illusion during his schemes in Tethyamar, when he used the jewels of ardor to entrance and destroy both dwarves and drow . Once the war between them reached its climax, he disappeared with his Hal Stoutheart persona into the Eastern Reaches , prompting his assistant Inger Ingersdottir to send hirelings to find him. Instead, they unwittingly stepped from an Underdark cavern into the false village of Faraway. They were met by cheering crowds of locals heralding them as heroes, begging for to save the Duke from a drow invader.</p>
<p>At this point, the mercenary agents Zoraxzil the mind flayer and Silent the drow had been investigating Graz'zt's schemes on behalf of their employer, only to be trapped in the strange fake village and surrounded by demons. Though Zoraxzil's psionic powers let them see the trickery of the scene, they were incapacitated after eating the brain of a dretch, and Silent's mute nature meant he was unable to communicate easily. Though Graz'zt had set up Faraway in order to have the two sides kill each other, the rather simplistic storytelling and inch-deep setting made it easy enough for some light circumspection to carry the day, causing the demon-villagers to break character and try to kill everyone. Graz'zt was displeased by the heroes derailing his plot, but shrugged it off and invited them to come have a final showdown with him.</p>
