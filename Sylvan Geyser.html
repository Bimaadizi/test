<p>The Sylvan Geyser was a popular landmark and a holy site of the Church of Eldath located in the town of Centaur Bridge , Turmish .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The geyser was a beautiful sight. It exploded in a blast of boiling hot water sent high in the air every hour. Many travelers took a detour when traveling along the Halondar to see the Sylvan Geyser with their own eyes. Apart from regular gawkers, the Sylvan Geyser was often visited by clergy of Eldath who considered it to be a holy place of worship. Eldathyn worshipers stayed at this natural shrine for a day or two, quietly praying and showing devotion to the Goddess of Singing Waters.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Sylvan Geyser has been a local attraction for many years before a drastic rise in popularity in the late-14 th century DR . The newfound attention was brought to the Sylvan Geyser due to enchanted trinkets, jewelry, gems , gold , platinum , and other treasures started being spit out by it every other week or so. Curious treasure hunters theorized that a stash of loot was hidden somewhere under the geyser. Magical means of peering into its depths and divinations bore no result. A mage attempted to dive into the geyser in a wraithform but mysteriously was turned solid as his leg was stuck in the hole. The wizard managed to wiggle out as the geyser sent scalding water burst up in the air, but he was badly hurt in the process. As of the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , the Sylvan Geyser's treasure remained unclaimed. Some thought that the loot inside had something to do with Centaur Bridge's vanished mansion, while others virulently insisted on the treasure to be left alone.</p>
