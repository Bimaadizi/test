<p>The Rotburg Slum was a poverty-stricken neighborhood located in the city of Almorel on the Lake of Mists in the Hordelands .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Slum was not part of Almorel proper, sitting just outside of the city's protective walls to the west. A small unnamed tributary of the Lake of Mists further isolated the Rotburg Slum from the Golden Bridle caravanserai and other structures found outside Almorel's western walls.</p>
