<p>Ulcrun was an insinuated poison .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ulcrun was a thick liquid with a milky-white coloring.</p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>Shortly after being introduced to its victim by insinuation, ulcrun caused damage to muscles, tendons, bones, and ligaments, and continued to do so for a short time thereafter. Until proper healing could be obtained, the poison left the victim weaker and with slightly reduced motor functions. Ulcrun was effective against any warm-blooded creature.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ulcrun was one of sixteen formulas for poisons recorded in the book known as The Nathlum . It was thought that the formulas were originally written down by the mage Lethchauntos the Black , during his time spent with an orc tribe in the 10 th century DR . Some of these same formulas were copied from the book by the mage Phrandjas of Port Llast and sold to local alchemists before the midâ€“14 th century DR.</p>
