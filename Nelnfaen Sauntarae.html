<p>Nelnfaen Sauntarae was the only drow Magister . He hailed from Sshamath and reigned from 1104 DR to 1126 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nelnfaen was the Master of Alteration in Sshamath and so a member of the Conclave of Sshamath . However, Nelnfaen broke with the Council, becoming a renegade for his wish to spread magic, especially magic not connected to faerzress . Nelnfaen considered the faerzress as an evil weakness that made the drow subservient to the rulers of their cities, usually clerics of Lolth .</p>
<p>He wandered the Underdark exploring many areas, especially the Upperdark . In his tenure as Magister, he befriended some priestesses of Eilistraee and even a few humans from Waterdeep . However, in truth, most human wizards of the surface never realized that there was a Magister in the Underdark and thought it was a time without a Magister.</p>
<p>His fate was unknown, and one day in 1126 DR, Azuth appeared to Olohmber Starnardyn , offering to him the position of Magister.</p>
