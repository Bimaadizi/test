<p>Lolth's Stings were blades wielded by the most devoted Lolthsworn drow assassins .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lolth's Stings were completely black shortswords that did not reflect light. The swords' grips were intricately carved with the image of a web while hundreds of tiny spiders decorated the 2 feet (0.61 meters) sword's edge.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Apart from a +1 enchantment that guided the wielder's hand toward a target, these blades possessed two other enchantments. Lolth's Blessing allowed the wielder be unaffected by mundane and magical webs , while Lolth's Curse possessed a chance of ensnaring targets in webs.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These swords were typically presented as gifts to the drow of the Underdark who served the Spider Queen and performed assassinations in her honor. Those who wielded Lolth's Stings waited until the sword's magic cocooned their opponents in magical webs, then finished the job from a distance, using a poisoned dart or a wrist-crossbow bolt .</p>
<p>One of these magic blades fell into the hands of a conniving drow merchant of exotic goods, Nym , sometime before the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR . He offered the sword for sale during his stay in Icewind Dale 's Wandering Village .</p>
