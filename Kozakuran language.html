<p>Kozakuran was a language spoken by the Kozakuran people, inhabitants of the realm of Kozakura in Kara-Tur .</p>
<p>Kozakuran descended from the ancient Han language , as did Koryo and Wa-an , and possibly others. Kozakuran and Wa-an were closely related; some considered them only different dialects of the same language. There was perhaps 65% comprehension between the two.</p>
<p>It was considered a sophisticated language, thanks to the high level of literacy in Kozakura and the frequent publication of poetry and plays there. Popular plays regularly introduced new accents and phrasesâ€”within a few weeks, a popular new play could change common greetings across the country, which could just as quickly be replaced.</p>
