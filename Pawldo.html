<p>Pawldo was a halfling adventurer who ostensibly lived in Lowhill .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Pawldo was a clean shaven, short and hardy individual around 3 ft (0.9 m) in height with shoulder length gray hair.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Unlike most of his kin, Pawldo lived for a life of excitement. He was a shrewd salesman who enjoyed theatrics especially while bartering.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Pawldo was often seen wearing a worn leather jacket and ancient yet fine-oiled boots.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He often traveled with Prince Tristan Kendrick , Robyn , and Daryth of Calimshan .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Throughout the winter of 1344 DR , Pawldo traveled about the Moonshae Isles and the Sword Coast in search of adventure and profit. During the Festival of the Spring Equinox on Gwynneth in 1345 DR , Pawldo was a seller of hounds. He sold Tristan the moorhound Canthus , but only after the halfling's overly-dramatic bartering. Later that night, he headed toward Lowhill with the halfling maiden Allian with whom he was attending a dance.</p>
<h3>Death</h3>
<p>In 1365 DR , Pawldo was slain shortly before the defeat and banishment of Ityak-Ortheel "the Elf Eater" .</p>
