<p>Mhandyvver's Poultry was one of two poultry stores in the town of Red Larch .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Mhandyvver's Poultry was located along the Long Road , next to Luruth's Tannery and across from Vallivoe's Sundries .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The interior of this store resembled a barn, with numerous exposed beams and posts. Pens for livestock filled most of the building's odd corners and halls, leaving only a narrow aisle down to the back where the staff and owner lived. These living quarters were separated from the livestock pens by a workroom that had cutting benches and a central hearth.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Mhandyvver's Poultry produced fowl, fresh eggs, and chicks for raising. These fowl included turkeys , chickens , and ducks whose wings had been clipped. They sold this poultry either roasted or preserved in oil , while eggs were either sold fresh or pickled . They were also known to sell pickled chicken livers.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In the late-14 th century DR the store was owned and operated by Oskler Mhandyvver . He frequently hired local boys to protect his livestock from foxes , hawks , owls , weasels , and other predatory pests.</p>
<p>In the late-15 th century DR, the store was operated by a descendant of his named Minthra Mhandyvver and her three children.</p>
