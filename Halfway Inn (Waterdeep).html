<p>Circa 1490s DR , a halfling thief who was tasked with a dangerous mission of recovering Laeral Silverhand 's stolen griffon cub from the infamous Xanathar's Thieves' Guild visited their favorite Halfway Inn to try and find some gossip or rumors on the subject. The thief ran across a talkative sailor who was abducted from Baldur's Gate but managed to escape, the sailer led the halfling to Volothamp Geddarm who gladly shared his insights on the matter, pointing the little thief towards Skullport , where the cub was likely held.</p>
