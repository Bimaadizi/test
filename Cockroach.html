<p>Cockroaches , also known simply as roaches , were crawling insects with a reputation as urban pests. They were a common nuisance in the city of Calimport , for example.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Although typically harmless against adventurers , cockroach swarms of large enough numbers could pose a serious threat. To those unequipped to handle it, the collective stench of such a group could be overwhelmingly sickening. Damage was typically inflicted by biting, though some swarms were able to eject a corrosive acid as well.</p>
<p>Particularly diminutive adventurers, such as those shrunk to a tenth of their size per the effects of a version of the reduce spell in use between the Time of Troubles and the Year of Wild Magic , were a more realistic target for individual cockroaches. At this scale, a cockroach's bite could inflict significant damage, and would slow an opponent down for a few seconds.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Cockroaches could be tracked by the pungent smell of their attar and droppings.</p>
