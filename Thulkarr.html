<p>Thulkarr was a war-leader of ancient Raumathar during the Great Conflagration .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Taking advantage of Narfell 's weakness following battles two years prior, Thulkarr led an army of unstoppable stone constructs against them in the Year of Bloody Hazard, âˆ’154 DR . Attacking from the north, the army used portals to outflank and overwhelm their enemies and their demon servants. When the Nar were pushed back to Narjast , Thulkarr's successes drove Ayarch Rauthok to petition the Nentyarch to unleash their last resort: the Dark Fissure , which involved opening multiple portals to the Abyss in order to open a planar rift. This plan was enacted when Thulkarr's army arrived at Dun-Tharos , and the resulting rift caused the army of constructs to vanish and be imprisoned on Acheron . It was unclear what happened to Thulkarr in the wake of this crushing and disorienting defeat, but any Raumathari survivors fled the battle using magic .</p>
