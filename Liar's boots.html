<p>Liar's boots were a variety of enchanted boots that could aid in evading pursuers, and that were popular in the the Dalelands in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When activated, liar's boots would leave footprints in a direction of the wearer's choice (which must be mentally concentrated upon) and left no footprints of the actual direction the wearer walked with them. This effect could be activated twice per day.</p>
<p>The maximum length by which a false trail could be made or extended out to was 100​ to ​600 yards (91​ to ​550 meters). Upon going beyond that limit or removing the liar's boots , the wearer's real footprints would begin to appear while their false ones dissipated.</p>
<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
