<p>Nighthaunts were the weakest and smallest type of nightshade .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nighthaunts were said to somewhat resemble a gargoyle made of night and shadow, including curling horns and a tail. The eyes were the only part that were a different color: they were pale and lifeless orbs inset into the flat, triangular face.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Nighthaunts were thoroughly malicious creatures that took pleasure in the destruction of the good and the innocent.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like the other nightshades, nighthaunts radiated a desecrating aura of great power, but were averse to sunlight. Additionally, nighthaunts could drain the energy of living creatures by pressing their blank face against their victim's.</p>
<p>Nighthaunts possessed a number of spell-like abilities, being able to mimic deeper darkness , detect magic , see invisibility , and unholy blight at will; contagion , greater dispel magic , haste , and invisibility thrice each day; and hold monster , finger of death , ice storm , and plane shift once each day.</p>
<p>One time each day, a nighthaunt could summon either 3-6 shadows , 2-4 wraiths , or 1 greater shadow to aid it.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Nighthaunts preferred to harass well-organized or stronger opponents from a distance with the spell-like abilities, often using deeper darkness and invisibility to cause confusion and division. They typically went for spellcasters first when they entered melee.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Nighthaunts were native to the Plane of Shadow , but they were drawn to places of defiled goodness and evil power, such as desecrated temples and emptied graveyards.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1375 DR , a nighthaunt named Ysval led an army of undead with the goal of conquering Thay .</p>
