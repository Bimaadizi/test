<p>Highwater ale was a cheap curiously-flavored ale that was imported from Highcastle 's the Shield and Keep tavern.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Highwater ale was a clear liquid with a very distinct minty flavor that was considered to be an acquired taste due to the drink's burning sensation.

The ale was produced in small bathes and was considered to be home-brewed.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Highwater ale was rarely found outside Highcastle , even though by the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Highwater ale's popularity reached the Sword Coast and the ale could be purchased at the inns of Daggerford , such as Happy Cow and Black Stone Inn , as well as Liam's Hold 's own Holdfast Inn .</p>
<h2>Rumors and Legends</h2>
<p>If asked, Highcastle locals eagerly shared their belief that Highwater ale's peculiar flavor came from the bones of monsters that lived deep inside the town's well that was used to brew this libation.</p>
