<p>Carcass eaters were a type of animalistic, burrowing zombie , that emerged following the Spellplague . They were said to arise from rodents that had gorged on the flesh of a necrotic canine.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These undead were small in size and streaked in gore. They looked to be a cross between giant rats and desiccated wolves , most distinctly having the ears and tail of a rat. Though the size of their toothy jaws was unlike that of any wolf and spikes jutted from their body. On average their bodies measured 3​ to ​4 feet (0.91​ to ​1.2 meters) in length and weighed around 65​ to ​75 pounds (29​ to ​34 kilograms).</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>These undead could see in areas of low-light and total darkness .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Carcass eaters preferred to fight in groups, surrounding and flanking their foes. They fought with their sharp claws and teeth. Upon the scent of blood they would fly into a frenzy and temporarily become stronger, though easier to harm.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>These undead had no requirement to eat in order to survive, yet they still often feasted upon flesh. They typically obtained this by digging up fresh graves, though if these were not readily available they would go hunting at night.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>

<p>In the Shadowfell , carcass eaters could be found in the Burning Woods , a dark reflection of Faerûn 's Neverwinter Woods .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>These undead could often be found in the company of other undead, such as deathlock wights , or under the control of a necromancer or evil cleric .</p>
