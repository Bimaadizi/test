<p>The Bhuklyns were a collective of wealthy merchants, living within the city of Ravens Bluff during the 14 th century DR . They made their living as iron -workers, making such everyday items as pots, cooking pans, hooks, chests and safe-boxes, including their specialty rodent-proof " Bhuklyn's boxes ", all stamped with the symbol of their house. The endogenous presence of their items within homes throughout the Bluff led to the saying "Bhuklyn's is everywhere".</p>
<p>The Bhuklyns had phenomenal sales throughout the entirety of the Vast , and rewarded their purveyors with a larger-than-usual amount of the sales profits. While the Bhuklyns saw this as fair, it inspired significant loyalty within their vendors.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The origins of House Bhulkyn came from a group of merchants called the Raven Moon . One of their shareholders, Aldimo Bhuklyn , bought out his associates and made the organization his own. He restructured the business from several brick-and-mortar shops to a great number of small street vendors, and began to promote Bhuklyn wares across Cormyr , Sembia and even as far south-west as Amn .</p>
